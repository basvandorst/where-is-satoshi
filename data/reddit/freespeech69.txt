..And then they'll go back to their lives, which hopefully aren't centered around wealth, money, or an obscure online currency.
Life is short. Live for lulz.

Do you have Skype?

Great logic. No one would be mad about one million dollars being stolen, and so no one would be interested in catching him then!

I like how this information is always downvoted but never responded to. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:51:34
The sincerity is really overwhelming in that video
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:04:57
Something something no one promised a price, so it's not a ponzi! They merely implied it, by screaming "moon" every day. Also the fact that dozens of TROLLS joke about how it's a pyramid/ponzi scheme every day on here doesn't make me think about things at all... they're just assholes!
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:34:15
LOL and thanks
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:35:38
You have it all wrong. He should be treated like royalty, above the millions of hard-working, law-abiding, would-be-immigrants that also want to travel to the US.

"statistical modeling would show that a system sufficiently complex with so many contributors starts to behave in ways similar to individuals who, in turn, are really just complex systems responding to contributing inputs" nice. r/iamverysmart

Yeah..... no.
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:28:49
A subreddit with the logo of a butt is stupid? I'm with you, I was expecting serious, intelligent, euphoric discussion. Instead it's all stupidity over there! My heavens!
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:41:27
what did it say?
@_date: 2015-01-18 11:08:06
um he's stealing your idea, are you really going to let him get away with this?
@_date: 2015-01-07 09:06:42
Welcome to a sub that is moderated (censored) beyond belief, and will attempt to shame you for discussing any crypto other than bitcoin.
Not exactly a good place to "filter out BS"
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:24:48
you are you are doing a fantastic job disrupting the Buttcoin community. They will probably stop any day now. Any day.
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:13:27
thank you for the sacrifice making me and others like me rich, and do enjoy the invisible internet tokens

To your knowledge has Changetip ever had sockpuppet accounts?
@_date: 2015-03-09 04:01:28
Oh. So they exist but they always delete their accounts so you can't even point to one. That's convenient.
Also, what do you think about accounts like mine which aren't paid? Or do you think I'm paid? What's the difference in quality between submissions like mine and paid submissions?
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:28:07
He grew mushrooms and sold them, so that would imply " he was actually selling drugs".

Keep ripping people off, trying to convince unknowing people your cult coin is a "better" payment system than the more advanced altcoins, scammer.
Stay true to your financial payment club! What a noble cause! You're such a nice guy for doing this project all for free! (oh wait except you subconsciously hope that bitcoin adaption grows and therefore the value of your coins do too) 
@_date: 2015-02-06 12:16:21
So clever! I was wondering if it was available on the internet, neckbeard
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:50:23
Lol, ok. Good luck to you! :)
Edit: actually fuck it
"I am not harming anyone" You harm the stupid, poor people that get sucked into your cult
"I cannot generate ad revenue in any shape or form. I don't have any information of users that I can sell or something. Where is the greed?"
By spreading awareness, you raise the price of Bitcoin, raising your own wealth and profiting. More bitcoin users=higher bitcoin price=more wealth for hodlers
Fuck your cult.
Oh, what, you're just genuinly interested in volunteering your limited hours on earth for the good of a new payment system that's still in beta? Right, that's logical. I mean you could be helping animals, the environment, or real humans.... but keep on fighting for this one type of digital payment system! You're such a good person!
@_date: 2015-02-06 12:16:45
lol what a fucking retard
@_date: 2015-02-08 06:24:01
LOL so how much have you lost. nvm i dont even want to know hahahah
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:39:38
"Is it logical for people to bring down/hate something that is completely a losing battle?"
Yes, it's way more hilarious. There are so many smart people sucked into the Bitcoin cult. The comedy gold won't last forever, I must treasure it while it's here. You're not alone! Paycoin is evaporating ( under SEC investigation and will be gone soon. So, I have to laugh at it quickly before there's nothing left to make fun of!
"People like you don't DO SHIT except bash and troll about anything."
You have no idea who I am in real life, or what I do. Bashing on cults is just my nighttime lolz before bed.
Look, you're not a bad guy, just obviously clueless. I don't really wanna continue this discussion though, gotta do some other stuff. Good luck to you in your life, I mean it! You can have the last word!
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:49:30
Don't worry, it's saved here forever, and is in the buttcoin hall of fame 
@_date: 2015-02-08 11:05:25
lol what even
@_date: 2015-02-08 06:44:18
MOM! THIS GUY ON THE INTERNET IS HURTING MY FEELINGS!
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:41:38
Dude... You're totally missing the point, and that's why it's so funny. I'm not even sure whether explaining it to you will do anything for you, so I won't try. 
But I'll ask you this... Why do you think my comment is 12 upvotes up, even in a subreddit that viciously downvotes/deletes comments deemed unsupportive of bitcoin related efforts? Why do you think my comment is more upvoted than your entire post, sitting at 5? Do you think it's because you're a visionary and I'm a troll, or do you think maybe I have a point?
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:30:15
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:53:15
Also, I love how you said "Kind of serious now isn't it?"
As if:
1) You were referring to faces of bitcoin
2) I was making fun of Humans of New York
...Dude.... you're hilariously delusional, like so many people in your cult. You do realize it's a cult, right? Do you have any awareness of the hilarious (online) social interactions that take place between your cult members? Do you wonder why there's an entire other subreddit that makes fun of this one? Out of curiosity, what do you think when you read posts in communities like Paycoin (hashtalk.org)? Do you think they're crazy, and you're in "the good guys" club?
Anyways, about the whole project faces thing, since you don't get it
New York is a city, a location. 
Bitcoin is a pump and dump situation.
The first project is art, a truly selfless deed.
Your idea makes me shart, it's based on greed.
I feel sad that I have to explain this.
You mad scams are why Bitcoin's famous?
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:42:45
You said you'd never seen a post with -36... well the post I linked to is currently sitting at -66. In your face, neckbeard! haha, eat a dick, fedora head. *does victory dance*
P.S. your cult tokens went down in value again today
@_date: 2015-02-08 06:22:55

Will you guys ever give up, or is it your goal to be the laughing stock of the internet?
@_date: 2015-02-08 08:52:45
Lol! Good one! Because I'm a bastard, right??! Haha! Nice, got me.
@_date: 2015-02-08 06:26:12

Companies DO things. 
Bitcoin literally doesn't do anything. 
Paypal at least helps people use money online. So do credit cards.
Bitcoin is laughably slow and limited to an extremely low number of transactions per second. That will never change.
Unless your split clan battle it out enough, and one side wins and then we the 20gb change or whatever. 
Bitcoin is laughably stupid, that's why Buttcoin is called Buttcoin. Buttcoin. Butt. Coin. It's a bad crypto currency that wastes computer and environmental resources.
I have nothing to defend, no product/service/currency to push on anyone. I'm just fucking with you nutjobs because you're fighting a losing battle. It's hilarious. I do the same thing when mormons come to my door.
Oh, and LOL you're mad. Stay mad, kiddo *pat on the head*
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:35:31
Haha! Nice! Lol they all do, I get it XD

Just stop ripping people off. It's mean. That's why I care. I don't like scam artists, they're bad.
It's not an innocent tech-related hobby. It's trying to profit off others. Pump and dump.
