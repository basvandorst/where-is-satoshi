Thank you so much! Mind giving me a quick run down on how changetip works or how I can use these bits?

Guess this never worked
@_date: 2014-11-03 03:15:52
Any suggestions on what app or web-wallet(if you call that) to use these bits?

If you're in the jailbreak community, perhaps tip the developers

Good point, hopefully tipping goes as far as supporting artist and such for higher amounts. And thank you for the tip good sir.

Do you have a link to the tweet? I'd like to retweet it to get my friends to know about this

Why do you think no?

Native Colombian here (Medellin actually), we are not hardened at all, for the most part at least, just like any other city, you were probably in the "ghetto", you can tell when the buildings and the people don't really look like they own anything of value. This could've happened anywhere and I am sorry it happened in my city.

I think also, I feel like it could potentially out-do the PayPal "donate" button. And amounts could increase if users start tipping artists, software developers and other freelancers that are trying to get their career started through the web

I hope he doesn't but I'll take it
