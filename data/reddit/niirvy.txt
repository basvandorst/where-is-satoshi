I use samourai wallet. Great segwit wallet. Lots of updates to the sofware. Some great features. Highly rated.
I moved from mycelium to samourai a few months back and haven't looked back

Sold through the 250 wall @ 11k in seconds :( FFS
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:29:06
I also saw at least 3 batches of 40 BTC sold before they took it down :( most of that 250 wall sold

The man
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:46:49
I like it, thanks

Please be giving us your bitcoin address and your 12 phrase code so we can verify your identity lol.......
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:56:52
Blockfolio is excellent at this. Also tracks your investments

In the last 5 posts on new.
One article saying it will hit 100k this year
One saying 8k today
And this one saying bitcoin down 90$
You heard it here first. This year bit coin will be worth between 500 or 100,000 dollars
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:05:17
You WAY over paid on your fee, i have moved significantly more bitcoin around recently and paid MUCH less than you did. Next time choose a lower fee, 40 sat or so goes through
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:46:18
You are going to lose you money in this case.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:25:22
$6700 now and dropping 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:54:02
And dooooooooown the price plummets 
God damn it
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:50:54
Definitely maybe
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:49:57
$9600 currently
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:44:09
It has nothing to do with bcash. Bcash is going down harder than bitcoin right now
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:48:17
I'm sorry but I'm not sure in which world selling at an 89% loss of investment in 4 days is considered a good move. People can do what they want with their money.
Ps the guy is CLEARLY a troll spready FUD as bitcoin has not dropped 90% since Sunday. Check his history...
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:09:57
Wish I had money to buy this dip. $9400 Now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:34:49
Yup. And now it's dropping like mad again. Not sure we have seen the bottom yet. I need to stop checking the price for a week or so grr
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:41:15
Nope. Like a lot of us the price crash wiped out a lot of value. So it was people being desperate looking for a reason for it to come back up.
It was always going to rise again. Chinese New year will have zero affect
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:54:27
Ive always lived by never catching a falling knife and buying on the way back up when it cones to investments.
Hard part is knowing when it is coming back up with bitcoin ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:56:43
They are not banning it. They just want to stop it being used for illegal activities. Like all governments.
Misleading title.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:49:09
Classic. Buy high sell low. Who wants to wait a few weeks for a rebound up.....
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:28:53
Fluctuating from 10.2 to 9.8 is normal.  Rising to 20k rapidly and dropping to 7k is a dump.
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:42:52
And bitcoin dropped from near 20k to 6k. It's too volatile for them.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:25:33
What the hell can you drink that doesn't have any water? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:41:17
I regret checking that subreddit. What the fuck is that place. It is disgusting.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:38:00
You won't find anyone to trade with paypal. If you revert the transaction they lose their bitcoin.
