Miltibit is also great.
@_date: 2014-10-21 14:18:45
Still overpaying....
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:25:14
Ah, so basically multibit with more cypto currencies?
@_date: 2014-01-01 06:35:45
Split them into 50 BTC paper backups.
@_date: 2017-01-24 15:02:17
How? He's a moron.

You view by clicking the amount of scraped data points to receive instead of "1 day", "1 month", etc. It'll be better with more data points and better options.
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:35:38
X-Posted, thanks!

Technologies Used:
* NodeJS (for scraping and acting as an API for all the scraped data)
* MongoDB (for the DB...)
* p5.js for graphing

Nah. I have super cheap power and even mining a year or two ago with mid end Asics was barely breaking even.
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:53:46
He doesn't like things he doesn't understand and he won't understand it so I doubt they'll be good partners.
@_date: 2017-01-24 05:00:17
I can see both sides, him not understanding it and over regulating it, or him just ignoring it and being clueless.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:47:42
With my $15 asic it can get about $0.11 a day which isn't bad for such a cheap miner.

Youtube video? I haven't seen that.

Donate-a-thon to r/bitcoin users, or donate to reddit itself.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:59:22
Thats super cool! Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:25:53
Fastest as in it would take an hour to cash out.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:10:21
Yeah, simulations are good, I've tried stock and it was really fun, I tripled 1k :).
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:05:11
xD, but eventually there will be a crash (and by crash I mean like $400, and then bitcoin will recover in a day xD.)
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:17:01
Erm, tell your son: Buy low, sell high, because he just bought at a all time high.
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:59:44
Yeah its cool!
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:50:28
Oh okay cool.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:36:57
Thats a really cool idea.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:11:43
Yup, but its good that its a solid 740 - 760 right now for me, maybe I can get my parents to let me buy right now :).
@_date: 2013-09-01 09:35:10
Huh, well thank you
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:12:13
Sweet! I am in the US and my parents would be fine with registering, so that sounds awesome!
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:09:26
Right, speaking of which, since my parents would probably *hate* buying some AFK, what places can I buy which will give me my BTC in &lt;1 day? I've heard campbx is good...
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:50:38
Thanks, I didn't know that.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:15:26
Har-De-Har. But seriously, when those people cashed out we dropped to like $600 and we are already at $750 in like 2 hrs.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:57:17
Haha, true. I used IRL because I didn't know you guys knew AFK.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:34:51
Step 1: Jailbreak
Step 2: Install Mess With Words
Step 3: Use it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:04:28
I can lose $25 since Christmas is coming up :). Also, did it really double since last week?
Fake Edit: It totally did double since last week, gotta love bitcoinity!
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:20:28
A lot as in....? Thank you for that info though, I wouldn't want to waste 100+ GB's of data.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:13:23
Haha, don't worry I make stupid purchases too, my grandpa gave me $700, I put $300 in my savings acount and blew like $100 on video games :/ now I wish I had kept it so I could buy BTC with it!
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:05:25
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:57:58
Thank you so much!!!
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:04:54
They think its a good learning experience as long as I don't invest to much time or money in it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:07:40
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:46:41
Mine is almost ready, but my powered usb hub doesn't have enough power :( so I have to buy a better one.
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:02:31
BTCGuild works pretty well for me.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:14:02
Still, good info!
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:01:43
Ah, but your one is 4.5 GH/s so:
160 - 40 = 120
120 / 10 = 12
12 * 336 = 4032 MH/s or 3.93 GH/s
So yours would be faster in that case, but I am assuming that now that the difficulty has increased it would make the price go up, and that I bought my chips only a few months ago, so if we were to buy them at the same time, having a homemade would be cheaper, but since you bought yours before the price change, mine would be more expensive if I wanted 4.5 GH/s
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:18:33
What if I dualbooted my PC with Windows 8 (What I currently have) and a linux distro (to save space) and then just used the linux distro for my wallet, and I could use Windows 8 normally, or I could run the linux distro in a Virtual Machine, do you think that would work?
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:21:20
Thanks, thats exactly what I wanted to hear. I know it has really slow exchange rates and such, but I was wondering if it was theoretically possible.
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:39:05
I know, I like paper or clients not online but still, it would be awesome to have on a phone even if it was online.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:03:07
Yes! I find investing in companies and bitcoins extremely interesting! My grandfather has taught me a lot about it because hes a pretty big pro. I really think bitcoins would help me learn how do that, and with a small amount like $25, not much can go wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:17:25
Yeah, that's what I was thinking of using.

In reply to psych7111's comment and at the same time a little bit of pbsds (although the equation is not all right):
I have one I built for $50 that mines at 336 MH/s, because I am not dedicated at all to mining (I am a student), but if I wanted to spend 274 dollars
274 - 40 = 234 (Price of hardware not including miner chip ($10) is $40)
234 / 10 = 23.4
23.4 = 7862 MH/s or 7.67 GH/s
So, in this case it would be cheaper (but take up a lot more space and more power) to build one yourself, and you would not have to wait for it to arrive. Also, if you are wondering how I made a dedicated machine for $50, I used something called a raspberry pi, which is a very small linux machine that you can use for a crazy amounts of tasks. In this case I used it to manage my miner chips.
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:57:12
Yea, I was thinking of using a Raspberry Pi, because I have heard from some people it works fairly well and a raspberry pi is only $35.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:03:47
Awesome! I will keep you in mind!
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:06:17
Really? Whats the server, that sounds awesome!
