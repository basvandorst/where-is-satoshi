You can just set up an account at Bitstamp, buy them at market value. If you transfer your money using a SEPA transfer (just a "normal" transfer) and withdraw the btc to your wallet of choice there aren't any extra fees. Transferring the money to Bitstamp takes 'bout one or two business days.
You, off course, still pay a fee for the trading but that's to be expected

You could use the Winkdex: 
"Winklevoss Index (also known as Winkdex) provides a blended price for bitcoins. Winkdex is calculated by blending the trading prices in U.S. dollars for the top three (by volume) qualified Bitcoin Exchanges during the previous two hour period using a volume-weighted exponential moving average. This proprietary formula weights transactions proportionally by volume as well as exponentially by time to give greater weight both to higher volume transactions and more recent transactions."

I was referring to the practice of getting your entire or &lt;50% of your salary in BTC. 
I wouldn't mind my employer to pay me 2% of my paycheck in BTC, I spend more on BTC anyways every month. However I know that this is not going to happen any time soon. 
Newegg only accepts BTC because it's a good marketing strategy. BTC is rising and getting more attention and it's easy for Newegg to accept BTC without having any real risk because they use Bitpay.

I fill in my credentials every time manually. My bank (ING) usually sends the SMS within 5 seconds. Overall this takes not more than a minute, how many confirmations can you get in a minute?
I don't think the protocol is matured enough for use in retail. I'm not saying it won't get there I'm just saying it's not there yet, surely not for IRL retail.

I did not know about the €1,- transaction fee. That's almost enough motivation to use XBT. If we're going with the 0 confirmation route, yes it would be quicker. 
But after all this my boss still does not pay me in XBT so I'll have to buy my XBT and pay a fee. 
I'm just playing the devils advocate here a bit. I know we're not talking about 1000's of euro's in fees but I don't really see why someone should go through all the hassle when they could also just pay in Euro's. Sure it's cool to buy a kapsalon with XBT but it's not real practical because you would first need to acquire the XBT. 
EDIT: Also, if someone would purchase XBT in the firstplace it would be a wiser decision to buy the kapsalon next week because (s)he might be able to buy 2 kapsalons. On the other side when you don't immediately spend the XBT you might only be able to buy a small kapsalon next week. 
I get the volatility is due too the use of storage for value instead of the use of the XBT as currency.  I would say XBT is not ready for mainstream adoption, it's still in beta.

Yes you're right, when using zero confirmations it's faster. 
For me this is comparing apples and oranges though. Of course zero confirmations transactions with XBT are faster, they require less security checks.
Just because most people use it doesn't mean it's the correct way it should be done.  
@_date: 2014-04-23 11:48:02

The key thing here is "...UNTIL NEW RULES IN PLACE".
So this isn't going to change anything because banks I think banks aren't getting involved with bitcoin (or other virtual currencies) because there are no clear set of guidelines.

The problem is we'll have to trust them not to act maliciously. Bitcoin was developed to be decentralized but here we are trusting a centralized system (Ghash). 
Sure this could work but it doesn't follow the philosophy of Bitcoin therefore we should try to change this. I'm not really an expert on the mining process but I think P2Pool would work.

Maybe could help us with the fundraising. We could sponsor If other coins sponsor other fighters (I've seen it mentioned over at we could have a battle of the cryptos
Nevermind this'll probably be buried

I also don't see why they don't make a Windows client, it's Java based so how hard can it be.

Yes, I think sponsored a Starcraft team. 
There's a big differnence though between a Starcraft team and NASCAR.

In my country transferring money to another bank account is free and takes one or two business days when moved between different banks. Transferring money within the EU is also free (yay SEPA) and takes about three business days.

There may be people who would like to own and use bitcoin but aren't comfortable with having their own wallet. Banks can get into play here, they could offer insurance etc etc

Don't invest anything in btc you're not willing to lose
@_date: 2014-09-08 11:55:02
Although I know this is a joke I would like to point out the suicide hotline was posted in January when the price was ~$800-$700. Now it's $460, that's a 57% loss. 
If you bought then you're investment isn't looking to good by now. 
Sure long term hodl hodl hodl...

Even though I just made a joke you do have a valid point. I didn't take the emerging markets into consideration. Even though I'm not yet personally convinced btc will be big in emerging markets.

Yeah there are places that accept bitcoin but should i use bitcoin when I can use my debit card, contactless payments or cash anywhere. 
Bitcoin just doesn't have any advantages over the regular payment methods here.

Yeah I don't see that happening any time soon in my country. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:20:10
I'd advise to hold off on buying. Most people buying now are buying because of FOMO... That usually doesn't end right.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:19:47
Sure I do suspect bitcoin might be a lot more worth than this 10000 we're approaching but the growth these last few weeks/months is similar to the previous bubbles we went through.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:18:47
I've been holding some bitcoins since when the going rate was 80 usd/btc. I know my shit. In my opinion this is a bubble, just like the last few bubbles.
It's OK to disagree with me, no need to banish me to the depths of personal finance.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:34:07
When the price goes up a lot in a short time frame there will be a correction. This is what I described as a bubble.
Sure bitcoin could potentially be worth a lot more than what it's now but that doesn't mean there won't be any bubbles until we reach that moon.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:51:29
No I'm saying this is not organic growth, we're in a bubble. 
The OP seemed to be denying the fact that we're in a bubble.
In the end that comes down to what you're saying, the price will go down after this gigantic rise over the last few months.

Don't do it man....
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:21:42
Yeah I don't know the correction will be, last few times it was pretty hefty.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:38:52
Like I mentioned in another comment I've been in bitcoin when the going rate was 80 usd/btc. So I've been around for a while. 
Sure your arguments are all valid but those arguments were all made during the previous bubbles. All those bubbles ended in the same way.... There will be a correction. I don't know if it'll be tomorrow or in a month, if it'll be 30 or 80% but I know it's coming.
@_date: 2016-09-05 20:29:58
Don't pretend bitcoin has a much bigger spread than most commonly used fiat. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 21:05:17
Yeah they could do that!..... or just use a fucking creditcard 
@_date: 2016-09-15 05:59:36
We were specifically talking about renting tesla cars and you said the people who didn't have enough btc should just drive shitty cars. 
There's no harm in realizing you're wrong on something. 
@_date: 2016-09-15 04:18:50
I don't think the people who can't afford a creditcard will want to rent a Tesla. Sure there are things bitcoin is good for, this is not it.
