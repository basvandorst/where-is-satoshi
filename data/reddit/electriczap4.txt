Flop a coin.

He has a point though - this idea isn't planted exclusively in women's minds either. 
Just as a woman may feel resentful if she doesn't get a ring, a man may feel like a failure if he doesn't provide a shiny chunk of carbon.

I tried paying with Shibes but they didn't want to stay in my wallet... 
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:30:54
Oh wow, I actually had to read that a few times before I could figure out if you were being sarcastic or not. 
Biting.

@_date: 2014-07-21 21:30:49
Lol, I want to use it for the novelty while I'm in the area. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 22:59:10
Some wallets, like electrum, have a master seed and can generate unlimited addresses predictably. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:08:38
But the question is: sold to whom?
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:03:03


You mean somebody gave you $5000 to destroy your phone?!

Nothing except your email, this information was gathered during the verification process.

It's value comes from its usefulness - something inherent to any currency.
@_date: 2014-01-01 18:46:36
They've done absolutely nothing!
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:08:46
Sounds good, I'll take the T back that way in a bit. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:09:34
Eh, I'll bite. Signed up via email. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:23:42
Thanks! To the Mun! 
@_date: 2017-02-17 11:40:30
Is it the same method that brainwallet.org used? 
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:23:05
I'm mildly skeptical, but if they can offer a proof of fairness I'd be down. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 19:41:37
Ah, okay. Their site never updated :(
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:48:15
Already found it - I can't get bitcoinj to work. Been too long since I worked with linux.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:19:08
Will this work? The network won't reject me?
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:18:48
Android bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:23:32
I've been trying, but can't get anything to work. It's been too long since I've used *nix I suppose. 
I got it decrypted, but I can't get it out of the weird format. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 12:04:12
This is very close to what I was looking for. I might just have to dust off my old c skills and give it a whack. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 22:32:48
Good point. Obviously the method of operation would have to be different from the standard blockchain protocol. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 12:08:49
Yeah, most likely. My C is very rusty, so rather than try to work out opencl or multithreading myself I'll try to modify vanitygens code. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 22:07:13
I think the idea is more of me making a custom currency, premining the hell out of it to the point of exclusivity. 
I will give you one coin for a dollar. I will also give you one dollar for a coin. The money in must always be the same as the money out, so there's no personal loss. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 13:12:34
Ooh, good idea! 
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:06:29
How you doin'? 
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:03:04
Let's convince Valve to accept BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:02:59
Obvious troll is obvious.
@_date: 2013-10-23 11:43:57
Posting so I can remember to send you gold for being awesome. 
Edit: Done
@_date: 2013-09-11 10:50:37
It's like Reddit Gold but useful!
Thank you kind stranger.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:32:48
And you're slowly getting bitcoin sent to that address... not saying I didn't send an mBit or anything ;)
@_date: 2013-09-11 23:31:16
Let's make it happen.
@_date: 2013-08-30 21:16:19
What happened at the crash at 266 with regards to bid/ask? 
@_date: 2013-09-11 02:09:13
Are... are you me?
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:27:08
A completely valid point.
Initially I was just pointing out that running the Silk Road (and IMHO I don't think he should be jailed for that alone) wasn't the only accusation levied against him, but you have a very good point.
Hopefully his lawyer will be able to call into question the validity of those chat logs.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:38:45
That's... quite a bit of money.
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:18:28
No problem!
It's funny since I end up spending a good amount in sheer fabric (to the point I could probably get a lower-end premade costume), but I really enjoy the process of figuring out what the hell I'm doing.
Plus it's really cool to know that YOU MADE what you're wearing to the con.
Regardless, if you get some wigs and whatnot in, I'll make it a point to shop with you in the future. And if you happen to come across a decently priced wig for Alucard... well...
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:40:05
Here... PM me your private keys and I'll help you out.
But in seriousness, I use electrum and can help you out if you haven't gotten it.
EDIT: I realize the joke might not have been clear to someone just starting out. But seriously. NEVER SHARE YOUR KEYS. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:11:27
So you would have absolutely no problem with somebody lunging at your chest with a knife, as long as they didn't actually stab you?
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:02:48
Which was exactly what people used to say about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 11:11:54
The day you're allowed to preorder KSP with Bitcoins so help me god I will say nothing else. 
@_date: 2013-09-07 16:16:37
They process the donation once every day, to prevent the TX fees from making the 100uBTC worthless.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:35:29
And trying to solicit the killing of several people. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:30:55
Fair point, I was just responding to the idea of him only being accused of "running a site that didn't hurt anyone".
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:38:24
Assuming you follow proper practices and play it safe, you should have minimal taint.
This is just saying "we found this wallet file on your computer, therefore you own these bitcoins" isn't easily proven.
@_date: 2013-08-09 05:19:08
About 2 weeks.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:11:37
In hindsight I realize the sarcasm in the first part might have not come across as I intended, making me look pretty sketchy.

@_date: 2013-11-29 07:13:10
Aaaand you post this right as I'm pinning up some fabric for my next costume...
Do you have any plans to expant to things that aren't generally user-made? IE wigs/makeup? I almost always buy those, yet most of the actual costume bits are made from scratch.
Also, nice work. All the products look to be really good!
+flip verify
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:19:29
Do you ship?
@_date: 2013-09-10 23:46:47
FIRST! Or... err... 50,000th?
Damnit why can't I be part of any of these cool milestones... I feel so left out =[
@_date: 2013-10-16 22:14:40
Except I could create a wallet with all the addresses I want. If my private keys are encrypted, there's no way to prove that I OWN those addresses.
