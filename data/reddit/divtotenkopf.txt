You won't trick me Bitcoin promoter. You're probably one of these guys working in troll factories in Russia to promote Bitcoin and avoid U.S sanctions. You fooled us once with Trump, you won't fool us again you fucking crooks!

Atleast my money is REAL, and it won't be removed by some ehem software bug.... No one will scam me out of my REAL money.
I invested in Apple my " REAL " money, and if you that I'm a loser for investing my HARD EARNED money, then what should I say about you ? Do you even work, son ? Millenials are so delusional. Unless you are extremely lucky, being a lazy bitter little loser will not make you a millionaire. Get to WORK!

Tell me Mr Smart worker. 60m$ gone just yesterday in NiceHash. Completely vanished. What would you do if you were concerned by the hack ?

Nice argumentation there. It's alright, I understand that you can't argue with my flawless logic. Bitcoin is a scam, you know it, but since they have you by the balls + you being a delusional little whiny kid, you can't argue against the truth :)

This is good. Bitcoin is a scam for lazy losers who don't want to work but want " free " gib me money from the internet. The sooner we get rid of Bitcoin the better. Better start getting to work losers ! It's not looking good for your scam -ehem digital currency .
