"but for me it's a shame and a real failure that science trying to solve people problems get so distant from them."
You hit on the absolutely key point of why we started Onarbor. We were tired of not being able to connect with people outside our own increasingly microscopic bubbles. We thought having an open platform where people from all areas could share and evaluate each others work would be a huge benefit to improving knowledge in the world. That and that people could also combine that with hopefully make a living for all their hard work were our major goals. 
Thanks again for all your kind words. They mean alot to us.

I'm a researcher at a university [\(seriously I am\)]( I want to crowdfund my research projects receiving money in Bitcoin. I put a Bitcoin address alongside my project, but how do people trust that this address belongs to me, Tim Peterson of Harvard University with email address peters8 
This is where I see a POI-based Sidechain coming in. The Sidechain's sole responsibility would be proving identity. It would be pegged to the Bitcoin Blockchain such that the money given would be pegged to the purpose for giving it.


In my case, the university would actually be the holder of the funds, i.e., the owner of the bitcoin address. This is how all research grant money is handled anwyay. If you are a company, than you'd be subject to coorporate law if you run away with the money. If you are an individual, then it's the same level of trust as giving somebody cash or a credit card. All of these scenarios are better than what currently exists with bitcoin where there is no framework for thinking about this.
The larger point is to start to think about how to build Identity into Bitcoin because this is a major factor limiting its adoption.

I understand this. But I strongly feel we have to do something rather than nothing. And while "nobody actually trusts godaddy", Google, Facebook, etc., the reality is the world is better off because these entites exist. They've helped people solve problems when no other solutions existed. And yes, Javascript sucks too, but you know we wouldn't be able to have this conversation right now without it. Analysis Paralysis isn't a good reason to not doing something. 
The lack of Identity is a real problem with Bitcoin. I don't see anybody focusing on it, so I want to help solve it.

serious question: why does being innovative matter? The people we ultimately want to reach don't care about innovation. Think Facebook, which basically innovated nothing. I personally despise Facebook, but there is no debate they essentially control the world. To reach our goals, adoption matters way more than innovation.
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:17:31
"why from the beginning of this year..."
Yes we are cancer researchers. The publishing and funding platforms we are forced to use aren't accessible to the general public. This is why we created [Onarbor]( We wanted a place where scientists could share and get funding for their work more broadly with the world.

Fair enough. My point though was that a stock CMS won't look original and will lack the branding to make the content stand out. Say what you want about Reddit or HackerNews but there is something original in the interface that allows the content to shine.  
Though Techcrunch, Time magazine and others uses Wordpress the work required on both the frontend and backend to create those sites is significantly more than "10 minutes". My basic point is that no site of value is assembled in 10 minutes and probably not even 1000 hours. I do understand where you are coming from, I just don't want Mathematician22 to be deluded by thoughts of "hey, I can create Facebook in 10 minutes so I should be rich too!".

Some people see the Alt coins as weakening Bitcoin (zero sum). My view is that the general population doesn't distinguish coins, our infighting slows us down, and that we should be rooting for all coins (positive sum). But it's ok to not agree with that.

"since most of the participants are so financially invested, carries the attitude that if widespread adoption doesn't happen then they won't get rich. "
This just seems to me exactly the reason that we should pull for the altcoins. We need to convince lay people that cryptocoins are useful. My parents, who are very rich (multimillionaires), progressively minded people, wouldn't even allow me to invest a couple $2-3K of their money in Bitcoin. That is insane. That's when I realized we needed a more concerted effort.

It's not a stunt.  [Onarbor]( is a micropublishing and microfunding platform we just launched this week. As you know publishing and funding is an exceedingly onerous process. The whole point of us creating Onarbor is to lower these barriers to entry for both publishing and funding. We feel that crypto really makes this all possible and that Kickstarter and others weren't addressing these needs. Maybe give it a shot if you get a chance.
Also, I'm happy to discuss your specific issues if you'd like to PM about it.
@_date: 2014-06-06 10:57:52


Thanks! we spent alot of time on this. The site plays back all content: videos, music, ebooks, images, and apps on **all** devices. That really took a long time to make functional and look nice.


We are inclined to agree. However, there are some factors which pushed us to make Dogecoin the "main label for the donation button". The main one is that Dogecoin is a more generous community. Reflective of this while noting that our site has only been live for two weeks, all funding of works has been in Dogecoin and none has been in Bitcoin. The problem with Bitcoin is that because people think it will rise in value, people are less inclined to use it. Whereas with Dogecoin, which is perceived as a toy currency, there's much less of a barrier. The "bits" conversion is helpful, but is still not widespread and can't beat the simplicity of some integer value of Dogecoin being an amount of money one needs not to worry about spending. All this being said, if Dogecoin fails we can easily make the switch to Bitcoin being the main currency. In fact, we had only bitcoin and credit card up until a few weeks before launch and added Dogecoin to set Onarbor apart and make it clear that we want people to be using cryptocurrencies and not fiat.


You are right again. If you hover over most buttons or links, help text appears to provide more explanation of what that particular button/link does. Also, our help and tour pages,  and  we think are quite thorough. That being said, we do need to add more instructions. The reasons things aren't more fleshed out are that: 1) I'm really the only developer on the site and it takes time to fill in details like this 2) we just launched the site and our focus was more on the getting the core functionality to work first: payment handling, content publishing, content viewing. If we didn't get those things right, then definitely people woudn't come back.
Again, great feedback, thanks so much. We've really have had great support from the Dogecoin community, if you might help us make some progress in the Bitcoin world we'd be super appreciative!

"And Harvard's endowment is worth over $20 billion..."
Employees at any university can't access the endowments. We raise **all** the money we need ourselves (mainly from the US government). In fact, we have to give ~25% of the money we raise to Harvard just to use their facilities. It has always been this way at all universities. 
The endowments go to building buildings and towards the students or in Harvard's/MIT's case, mainly sit there waiting for an extremely rainy day. They don't spend this money, ever. Not on us. Not on anyone.

I agree there will be only a few winners. I think we are making two different points. My point is more about who the "them" is in "us vs. them". I think "us" should be *all* the cryptocurrencies and the "them" should be the lay population. I'm only worried about the "them" being the cryptocurrencies one isn't invested in. 
For people we need to convince, e.g., the media, big businesses, it is perceived as a loss for the whole cryptocurrency concept when one goes down rather than a gain for Bitcoin.

Thanks for clarifying. Just note that dogecoin tipping, particularly of small amounts, is generally not appreciated here in It's like going to France and not even attempting to speak French. It is unnecessary and rude. I don't agree with it, but it's their space and one should be respectful.
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:40:41
Wow thanks for all these comments! Super useful.
1. "I cannot see how to find the donation address for your project on the site". The donation address is available on my Onarbor profile page (viewable without logging in),  It was somewhat hard on the Reddit post to explain our goal and the workings of Onarbor at the same time. "Also, your whole tour is invisible..". The tour is visible to both logged in and logged out users via the same address: 
2. "Putting the projects onto the front page with iframes is a little janky". Yes you busted us on this one. We wanted to show off that the iframes are actually widgets which could be on any website (like Youtube embeds but with funding buttons!). That being said, it most definitely is janky and we should lock the iframe height so there is no scollbar. The reason we just didn't go ahead and do that simple CSS fix is because the content and the reviews which are both clickable, change the iframe height and do so in a user-determined manner. Again, we just launched this week so lots of details like this to address. Great suggestion though.
3. "It looks like it is just a painting. Do you only have two projects?". Yes numbers of works are low, we just launched this week and we're in complete stealth before so nobody knows about us. The logged in homepage is a never-ended feed of all the works, we have about 50 so far, but yeah the logged out homepage only features a single example of both science and art right now.
4. "I'd change the "details" section of your own project to something that is easier for the layman to understand". Yes completely agree. The work descriptions are still in there very early stages in terms of their layout. We are trying to provide a lighter description than what Kickstarter and others make one do, but the debate is how much. We are trying to differentiate from Kickstarter by being more of a microfunding platform with a less involved publishing process. Of course we'd love for people to make elaborate things and raise millions of dollars too, but we feel that we have a nice untapped niche with the crypto emphasis and smaller budgets.
5. "Clicking on a single image and being taken to a slideshow of that one image". Correct again. There is somewhat of a learning curve for users in the publishing part that we haven't optimized yet. The cover image can or can not be one of the images from the work itself. We leave that up to the users but because everything is so new I think people are having a hard enough time figuring out what to do. We might want to just take away buttons when there is only one image, we'll think about it...
6. "Where's the bitcoin donation link?" If you edit the "FREE" input to something greater than 0 you will see that a Doge, BTC, and CC buttons appear. If you click on the BTC light blue button, the coinbase payment widget will appear. 
Thanks for the offer to consult with our team. We'd love more feedback. Where are you based? Can you code? We can talk about this via PM.

Hi thanks for your question. You can donate bitcoins wherever it says "BACK THIS WORK". For example on the biology page,  if you click the green text that says "FREE" or has a numerical value, then a form will open where you can type in an amount of Dogecoin (which is converted to Bitcoin) that you'd like to donate. Once you are happy with the amount, click the light blue button in the center of the 3 buttons that has Bitcoin on it, and a menu will appear to determine what method of Bitcoin you'd like to use, i.e., pay from your Coinbase account or donate from some other wallet. Once you select your method of sending Bitcoin, that's it! You will have donated to the project!
Thanks again for your interest and don't hesitate to ask any more questions if you have them.
@_date: 2014-05-28 02:54:32
Yes. The issues you point out are a major challenge. I'm one of the developers of [Onarbor]( Would love to chat more about your project if you'd have time, maybe via PM?
@_date: 2014-09-13 21:16:07
Hey, I'm a co-founder of Onarbor,  We would definitely love to help you get your game studio funded. We are heavy into Bitcoin allowing all types of transactions for both the funder and fundee.
If you're interested, please feel free to check out our site, PM me here, or email me anytime, tim

Very sorry about this. This is strange, I think one other person has said this and we can't find the bug yet. The error might not be from the password (password error message is still unfortunately tied to other errors for this form at the moment) but we're not sure yet. We promise we'll get a fix on it ASAP.
In the meantime, let me know if you again have trouble logging in. If You can reset your password from [your account settings]( Or if you are logged out, from this url:

@_date: 2014-05-27 15:18:35
Thanks for your comment. We created [Onarbor]( to address several needs that Kickstarter couldn't satisfy:
1. Payments: Most importantly is to allow payments in cryptocurrency and crypto-fiat conversion both of which Kickstarter don't do. Another aspect of this is that crypto allows per user funding at less than what you can do with credit cards ($0.50) so people treat it like tipping. So Onarbor is more of a microfunding platform though of course we'd love the big donations too.
2. Collaborators. Kickstarters are generated by one person. Whereas as you know most projects in academia and in general are collaborations. Onarbor allows multiple people as well as multiple organizations to collaborate on projects (we call them "works"). So Onarbor much more closely resembles your existing organizational structure where funding and the social network are one thing.
3. Reviews and Reputation building: A big part of academia is peer-reviewing and reputation building. Onarbor allows peer reviewing and in fact the reviews can also be funded too. Reputation is built by both voting on works and reviews. Our model here is Stackoverflow.
4. Dynamic projects: Lastly unlike Kickstarter, Onarbor allows playback and versioning of all works: documents, videos, music, images, files, and apps. Our model for versioning is Github (though we don't use Git because video files are huge).  Having a UI which allows you to edit and playback on the same interface is much easier than go back and forth between Kickstarter and Youtube for videos, Kickstarter and Soundcloud for music, etc. Onarbor is a real-time, one-stop shop.
hope this helps, great question!

YES, YES, YES! We love Bitcoin and have and will continue to give all our efforts to help people see its power. 
We are just getting started promoting our efforts and that's why we launched our site, [Onarbor]( 
Might you have more suggestions of people to reach out to? We'd love it if you might help us. We'd be more than happy to reward you for your efforts.

Hi Thanks for your awesome comment. Lots of great ideas. We actually think [Onarbor]( addresses many of the features you mention. [Please see our comment above](
Onarbor is a publishing and funding platform all in one. You can fund researchers or you can fund their works. The reputation comes from people reviewing the work and through voting on the works and reviews.
Would love to talk more about this if you're interested perhaps via DM?
@_date: 2014-05-28 02:12:17
Sorry for the confusion. [Onarbor]( is a micropublishing and microfunding platform we just launched this week. As you know publishing and funding is an exceedingly onerous process. The whole point of us creating Onarbor is to lower these barriers to entry for both publishing and funding. We feel that crypto really makes this all possible and that Kickstarter and others weren't addressing these needs. Maybe give it a shot and we're happy to discuss more. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:03:27

Onarbor founder here, ask me anything!
@_date: 2014-05-28 11:47:51
Thanks, you have a point. We allow both getting and receiving funding in crypto and USD (via Stripe and or Stripe-connected bank accounts). Therefore, those who want to use to trace their funding for tax purposes can receive the funds in USD.
[Onarbor]( isn't only about private patronage. We intentionally kept Onarbor flexible to allow for the broadest applications. We just launched the site and happen to be scientists, so that's where we are at at this point. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:34:46


Sorry if I still didn't answer your question regarding my post history.  Are you asking why I don't post about Biology and Medicine on Reddit? If so, the answer is because most of our community communicates offline or in esoteric journals that the general public doesn't read. That is what we are trying to change with Onarbor. 


Sorry about that. There's lots of comments. Its hard to know what I said to whom. I'll be more careful next time.
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:26:21
Ok fair enough, most effort should be behind Bitcoin, which it is anyway since there is not much you can do now with any of the other coins besides exchange them for Bitcoin. 
The more important point is about us not cannabalizing each other. I see the coins as a positive sum game. My great, great fear is that if one coin wants to go it alone then no coin will succeed.

Hi all, Onarbor founder here. Just came with a new slogan, "Tipstart your videos, docs, images, music, apps". Think this is more understandable than our previous one, "Make, Review, Fund Science and Art".
So we're a mini-kickstarter if you will. Come fund people with Bitcoin on Onarbor if you get a moment!
@_date: 2014-07-14 18:25:20
Did you try the site? It is quite serious. The slogan is just a slogan. It used to be "Make, Fund, Review Science &amp; Art" but we were looking for broader appeal.

Hi, sorry the post didn't meet your expectations.
"First, neither picture ties this post to the person in the picture. "
How would you like me to prove my identity? I'm happy to provide more info.
"Second, the address you mentioned..." Onarbor has the funds that aren't donated directly to my address. There are many ways to fund so I tried to simplify for the purpose of this post. Also, many of the funds aren't in Bitcoin. I was just estimating the amount in Bitcoin and USD to give people a ballpark of where we are at.
"I didn't even know MIT had anything to do with medical research.."
MIT is arguably the best biomedical research university in the world, with the Whitehead Institute being one of its flagships. Having been at both Harvard and MIT, I strongly feel that MIT is better.

Sorry, my question was lacking some details. I was wondering more about BTC theft on reddit in general and it being tied to usernames. Which is important to me because...
I think the internet should be more open, hence the sharing of my username everywhere and my indifference that you know about me.

Hi, great question. We require login for several reasons:
1.  To have some way to store what you've funded. Onarbor is an ecommerce platform and there are alot of key transaction details that are lost to the customer, buyer, and Onarbor if you don't know who the buyer is nor what they funded. For example, Works that you funded get stored in your "Library", which is the same as what iTunes and others do. Without knowing who purchased what, we are more limited in how much our service can benefit those who use it.
2.  Transaction latency: The transaction will take an hour to confirm vs. instantaneous with Coinbase. Moreover, our service is brand new and unknown to virtually everyone in the world whereas Coinbase is a relatively established player. Until Onarbor is more well known, there is greater security for the customers in known that your coins are being sent through Coinbase. Lastly, using Coinbase we will bloat the blockchain less if the transactions are "offchain" and amongst Coinbase users.
All this being said, we are very seriously thinking about providing a wallet address/QR code alongside the funding form such that you can just send the funds using your method of choice. We are still trying to see if issues  and  above are slowing us down in terms of people sending their Bitcoins on our service.
Would love your thoughts on the above...
@_date: 2014-05-28 10:50:34
"The real question is why aren't they getting funded by the NIH?"
We are funded by the NIH. Scientists seek and often have funding from multiple sources. What the NIH provides is typically not nearly enough. Also, the whole point of [Onarbor]( was to develop a new model for funding. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 18:32:39

Yes, this has been fully vetted by and operates well within our existing confines. It took several years to develop the concept behind [Onarbor]( to get everything right. We are so glad to finally launch the site this week!

Reviews are a huge part of the Onarbor platform. Both works and reviews are voted upon which determines a user's Reputation. If you are familiar with Stackoverflow, we are more or less doing the same thing with how we score Reputation. Reputation is a powerful way to judge one's contributions, MUCH more so than the current approach where in traditional journals you try to get 3 of your friends to review your work. 
Any one can review a work on Onarbor and the reviews can also receive funding. So great effort is rewarded both ways!

I was inspired by [Fred Wilson's post]( to start a Hackpad to come up with applications that would be **native** to Bitcoin. 
So **not** simple sending money from A-&gt;B as these can already be accomplished by any type of payment system.

Hi Onarbor co-founder here. Onarbor is a broadcasting and monetization platform. You can think of it as a monetized versioned of Twitter/Tumblr.

Sorry for the delayed reply. Thanks for the links on Bitcoin-accepting organizations.


We completely understand this and realize that Bitcoin's current and probably future value is much greater than Doge's. We aren't wedded to Doge, its just more in a wait and see mode because we literally just launched the site. 


Great suggestion. We just changed the site, please check it out. Now, next to "BACK THIS WORK", we include all 3 currency symbols. Also, if you hover over it, it shows "Fund with Ɖogecoin, ฿itcoin, $US dollars, or back for free".
There reason we don't show a "DEPOSIT Bitcoin in your Receiving Address:" next to the same one for Doge is due to the way the bitcoin vs. dogecoin are set up on the backend, which are fixed by the 3rd party services we are using, DogeAPI and Coinbase. The dogecoin accounts are setup such that each user gets one doge addresss, whereas Coinbase requires each user to have a Coinbase account which we didn't want to make people have. It's an annoying asymmetry but its one for which currently in the world there is no better solution for. If we just allow people to give BTC to a user address then we can't track various key metadata that most customers expect and businesses need for intelligence purposes, such as tracking earnings on a work by work basis.

You're off-base here. The PI3K-mTOR pathway is mutated in virtually all cancers. We know this area exceedingly well. Here's my advisor, who discovered mTOR, on pubmed:  You will not find a single cancer researcher in the world that will agree with you that mTOR doesn't matter.

I understand where you are coming from. Profits do motivate hospitals. However, cancer isn't one thing, so there isn't one cure. Most forms of cancer in fact have no reasonable cure right now.

This has been addressed by myself and others several places in the thread. Not a single penny from any university endowment goes to the employees. Ever. Academics fund themselves entirely through multi-year, incredibly exhausting review processes. That is why we are using Bitcoin and created [Onarbor]( to try and change the system.

We are funded by the NIH. Scientists seek and often have funding from multiple sources. What the NIH provides is typically not nearly enough. Also, a major goal of [Onarbor]( was to develop a new model for funding. 
"scientific committees should decide what research is worth funding"
Reviews is another big goal of Onarbor. Both works and reviews are voted upon which determines a user's Reputation. If you are familiar with Stackoverflow, we are more or less doing the same thing with how we score Reputation. Reputation is a powerful way to judge one's contributions, MUCH more so than the current approach where in traditional journals you try to get 3 of your friends to review your work.
Any one can review a work on Onarbor and the reviews can also receive funding. So great effort is rewarded both ways!
@_date: 2014-05-28 10:26:50


YES, YES, YES! This is precisely why we created [Onarbor]( Perhaps we could interest you could [try it out]( Might you have any works to publish? Even small, unfinished projects would be great!

It is actually not about the money at all. I'm happy to give you the money if people agree to that. The whole point is to introduce crypto as a viable non-profit funding mechanism and to cast Bitcoin in a favorable light for a change.

Bootstrap and the site layout isn't the problem. The main issue is building the backend that provides a unique value proposition to the users. 
My friends and I at Harvard/MIT built Onarbor,  to address exactly the types of things the OP is interested in. Just building it isn't the hard part. The challenge is in getting people to help grow the community and teaching people about it how to use it since that doesn't scale at all.

YES, YES, YES! It sounds like we are speaking the same language. All these things you mention are already possible on Onarbor. We thought alot about this. And you can even get funded for your reviews too. So the money flows both ways!
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:48:37
how about the legality of doing this? I guess nasdaq is a ".com", so presumably its legal for exchanges to tilt the trading in their favor too? Sorry to be such a noob, just don't know this space well.

Sorry we didn't meet your expectations, but thanks for your thoughts. The reason we created [Onarbor]( was to provide a lower barrier to entry for academics to publish and obtain funding. So Onarbor is a micropublishing and microfunding platform. The difficulties all of academics experience in publishing and getting funding were big inspirations for us and hopefully that can provide a little better understanding of how/why we presented this campaign this way. 
All that being said, we are a small operation that just launched Onarbor this week. Please believe us that we are actively thinking of ways to better present the work to those interested in it. Your suggestions here are hugely valuable to us.

Thanks for your comments. We went back on forth with this quite a bit. We opted for the in-your-face, Facebook, approach just because its does seem to work. That being said, completely agree that is obtrusive. Perhaps we can just make the signup form smaller. Are you looking at it on a mobile device? It doesn't take up nearly as much space on a desktop. We just launched this week and it's kinda tricky to optimize for every screen, so we just kinda did the best we could.

"but still want to support the content creator, why not see if they accept bitcoin donations?"

Just tried Doffr, you have to have a Bitcoin client. This doesn't have the same usability as Coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:36:21


Because if you want to have confidence in the identity to whom you are sending Bitcoins, that doesn't exist in a publicly available way. Coinbase and Onename and others allow it, but it of course would be better if no company owned your identity. 


Exactly. I'm proposing this as an **opt-in Sidechain**. Not something people have to do, but if they want, e.g., for crowdfunding, they can.
@_date: 2014-05-28 02:32:28




YES, YES, YES! Reducing the inefficiency in the system was precisely our goal in developing [Onarbor]( Another goal was to lower barriers to publishing and funding. Making a micropublishing and microfunding platform in Onarbor, we felt we could both reduce the time researchers were spending not doing actual science, and as you alluded to, allow people to stress less about the money they were giving.

Why are trying to introduce crypto to non-profit funding and casting Bitcoin in a positive light bad things? 
@_date: 2014-06-06 19:40:31


:) I like that. Still, from a coding and UI perspective, having multiple inputs and then multiple submit buttons isn't ideal. That's why we went with one input, which if interested, reveals 3 submit buttons: doge, btc, usd (credit card). Before the Doge-centric switch, we had the default label in USD, which is far more understandable to the masses, but we felt was backward-thinking and going against the whole crypto revolution. We didn't want Onarbor to be some rehashed version of Paypal, but something new that rather people would have to explore and figure out, just like they did with Paypal all those years ago.
I get where you are coming from with the Bitcoin-first philosophy, but honestly the interface and backend was hard enough to build all by myself integrating with 3 different currency handlers and exchanges, etc. that once I got it in place doing anything else seems painful. This decision was then justified when we launched and really only so far have racked up Doge with you being the first to question the Bitcoin-2nd approach or even ask how to donate Bitcoin. All that being said, if you have an interface in mind where Bitcoin figures more prominently yet still maintains the aesthetic I'm all ears.
