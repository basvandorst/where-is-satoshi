I wasn't being very serious.  Just a fairly bad joke pointing out a minor irony.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:18:24
No, they're not very similar.

Because they should be getting something FROM that debt that is more valuable than the debt cost itself.
For example;
You have Trucking Company A with 10 trucks, you recently paid off the cost of the trucks, you have no debt, and are working as many contracts as you can with 10 trucks.  
I have Trucking Company B with 10 trucks, but I just bought 10 more and now I'm in debt (10 trucks worth).  I'm working as many contracts as I can with 20 trucks.
The idea here is that I'll make 2x the money you are, I'll eventually be able to pay off the other 10 trucks and I'll have twice the number of trucks you have working for me.  
Not only that, but I get all of the passive bonuses of having more business than you, I can go for bigger contracts (super lucrative contract that requires 15 trucks? i can get it, you can't) and I can do things like buy your company (and be in debt again), so that I can compete with another company.
Being in debt for 10 trucks isn't good, but if I'm spending wisely i'll be in a much better position eventually.
Countries do the same thing, the USA might be in debt for 1,000,000 trucks, but if they have 1,000,000,000,000,000 trucks already running the world of trucking, it basically doesn't even matter.  You could say that the US is "1 MILLION TRUCKS IN DEBT" but that's way better than Country B who has "NO DEBT AT ALL" and also only owns 2 trucks.

So they just do this for free?
 ..why?

In a few states

Bitcoins operations are decentralized, but the protocol itself is maintained by a group of people.  For some, this is a criticism of Bitcoin, and they rally for cryptos that have fully decentralized everything.

So now it's you (people who don't care) vs (people who do care), can't escape the battles!
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:08:30
Any corporation/nation SHOULD have debt, it's useless info if the economic power of that country isn't considered.

How much do they keep on hand, are they FDIC compliant like Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:03:36
Alright, you promise to give me any you find then, friend, I'll gladly keep you from having to deal with that.

I assumed that over 50% of the bills would still have to be available.

You guys can trade me your fiat
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:43:42
The federal reserve?  
I don't think that's right.
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:05:52
So you use it as a form of trade?
Like a currency?
@_date: 2019-02-19 12:35:36
Why would the greedy untrustworthy fiat owners crash their own currency in the first place? 
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:41:46
The value of BTC has doubled and halved and everything in-between over the last six months, the validity of it as a useful coin hasn't changed in that regard to match those values.  
XMR might have a very promising future, privacy might be the reason, but I gaurantee that the majority of transactions in...well every coin, is trades, buy-ins, and sell-outs.  Compared to how many people are using it as a currency itself.
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:35:11
At least, it proves that people believe that other people believe that privacy is important.

Your 2nd sentence is incorrect.  When more people have money, it doesn't mean that money is worth more.
There is nothing that BTC price is based on, its not a share of a business, it's a bet made on whether people think its going to be valuable in the future, and people trying to buy low and sell high based on predictions.
If/when btc gets major adoption as a currency, the people holding onto btc now are hoping to cash in on the price shooting up, from there it's just currency exchange.

"..and possibly dump tether as one of the main pairings"
I think it proves the opposite, they're finally getting looked at for Tether and they say "hey guys, that whole USD thing we didn't want to do, we're doing it!  and don't worry about that whole tether thing, it's legit but we might drop it.."
@_date: 2019-01-12 16:58:15
Sell me all your USD for discount?
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:52:35
That's not why we bought it, honestly.
We bought it to make money.
Those benefits that you mentioned are just the selling points of the asset that we bought to make money with.

They're in the blockchain :D

What a nice way to put it.

How does this separation help anybody?

Did you know that Pusha-T wrote that song?
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:48:29
Yeah, or more likely he's trying to take advantage of people who will think BCH is BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:34:42
The confusion is for new adopters even reading into it, not people sending stuff to the wrong type of coin address.  People who find Bitcoin.com will think that they are looking at BTC having no idea that there is a BTH or that there is a difference.
The world is a nicer place if I just assume everybody is nice?  What are you talking about?  Do you buy into every altcoin scam?
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:16:23
Member low transaction fees? 
I member!
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:20:16
Sure, just call it ScaleCoin instead of Bitcoin and I have zero problem.
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:46:10
Give me all of your fiat then.
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:54:22
I dont know how many btc were created today either.
