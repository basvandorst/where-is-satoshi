I am lol. The BTC community is not that big currently. Around 200Thousand people. 
In Argentina the current anual inflation is 30-40%. Bitcoin is a way to save what you have (SOV) even in the current state. Usually in this space we look at bitcoin as a way to buy through amazon but the real utility is in this economies where FIAT is worthless is already there

There is an NGO for bitcoin in our country  that groups btc people and also we have some local exchanges (fiat &lt;—&gt; crypto) that has this amount of people registered through kyc processes. There could be more outside this systems like localbitcoin but the official number is around that.
