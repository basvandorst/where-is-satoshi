No need to get sensitive. All I'm saying is that there seems to be an apparent trend of when BCC spikes, the whole market seems to go down soon after. Maybe it has something to do with BCCs apparent affiliation with BTC (which other coins do not share? IDK).

I had two whole bitcoins that I turned into dogecoins for a bit, had fun with them and was going to turn a tidy profit.
Then the dogevault 'hack' and I lost it all.
It sucks, but c'est la vie.
Someone who reacts like OP's brother because they sold too early (but probably still made a tidy profit) shouldn't be actively involved in investing at all, he clearly had an unhealthy attitude. They should just invest in trackers or put their money in a pension fund then leave it be.

You joke, but it seems that whenever BCH gets big ideas the whole crypto market suffers. Its happened twice now. Probably because some BTC investors jump ship to BCH. This makes BTC price fall, which then makes everything fall.

If he hasn't received his BTC yet (which presumably he hasn't considering the transaction is pending on his bank side), nothing will happen.

I dunno, as an investment, blockchain currencies IMO are inevitable and are guaranteed to be successful.

Anyone else really worried that this childish gaming between BTC and BCH by a few at the top is going to fuck over all acceptance of (any) crypto as a currency long term in terms of general public usage?
All the recent shenanigans have shown to me is how fundamentally broken these coins seem to be with so much wealth and control with such a small amount of people who's only merit behind their wealth is that they 'got in early'. I'm getting sick of it tbh.

Profit/Gains yes. Don't think of a change in bitcoin value as being profit until you have actually sold them and the GBP is in your wallet, up to that point remember the price can go up as well as down.
In terms of taxes, my interpretation of it is that its only due on any post-selling profit, but then again, I'm not an accountant.

1. Backup the wallet.dat file, that's the one with your money.

@_date: 2013-11-20 13:31:47
or, as a better idea, hold what you have and buy more BTC at the low value, rinse, repeat until you have a load of bitcoins a few years down the line. Sell then as the LONG TERM trend is still an increase in value.

If you are looking for daily fluctuations, look to last tuesday, the price dropped by about $200. Its recovered now. But my advice. Buy now, and hold. At least you'll have something.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:27:08
Because instant buy presumably uses less stringent security checks for quicker transactions, and 1BTC is now worth too much to take the risk.

localbitcoins has been fine with me, just make sure you find a buyer with good rep (I generally go with people with 100+ trades/ high 90%/100% reputation). MtGox if you want the most security, but it might take a while to cash out (haven't actually tried yet). Has anyone had any MtGox cashing out experience in the UK?
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:32:59
localbitcoins.com is your best bet for getting bitcoins quickly for that small amount. Do a direct bank transfer. You have escrow protection on there and similar sites to make sure you don't get scammed, unlike here.

So its only a problem if you want to withdraw often from your account. If you have a lump of capital set aside that you put into a MtGox account and aren't interested in withdrawing until you've made x profit, trade away. 
Could you not transfer bitcoins directly to another exchange that has quicker withdrawal times than your Mt.Gox account when you want to cash out? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:21:35
Isn't bitcoin more protected from things like that happening as its decentralized? The potential for panic selling is probably higher though.
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:01:10
localbitcoins.com for convenience, very quick usually. The mark up isn't that bad (cheapest currently on LBC is £468, versus £455 on mtGox), considering the price is going up, no point quibling over a tenner (especially with the mtGox fund adding process times, where the delay might cost you).

Very minor problem here - assuming this is rent and taking into account the stability of Bitcoin, the rent is going to need recalculating from USD every month, otherwise, at the rate of BTC increase, some estate agent is going to end up very rich. Which also means no direct BTC debits.

144,000 BTC apparently. If sold in one go, the market will take a hit, but it should recover (this is still only 1.2% of the bitcoins ever mined), it might actually make it rise faster afterwards, as liquidity will have increased.

Litecoin fluctuates between $30 and $40 generally speaking. When BTC value decreases like today, the LTC/BTC generally trends down to 0.03ish. When BTC stabilises/is in a slow rise, the LTC/BTC value seems to trend to 0.04. So to answer your question, yes, you can. Not to say it doesn't come with risks. BTC-E is a pretty good place to do it.

Yes, capital gains include property (or estimated value of).
If the value plummets and you have negative gains overall (including any property you purchased), you don't pay any tax on it. No idea about it being a deductible, I don't see how it would be.
I think (for the time being), gains from bitcoin aren't taxable until you sell them off.
Also, find out what your capital gains tax free allowance is.

@_date: 2013-11-25 11:32:52
Is this what usually happens in these situations? I thought the banks would just refund the money to the stolen persons account (paid for by insurance), not try to reverse vendor transactions, you aren't in the wrong here (you are being paid for services rendered) and can reasonably expect to be paid. If the bank takes the money back from your account, isn't the bank deFacto calling you a criminal? I'd go and talk to your bank about it.
This could be an issue with trading through a (presumably) personal bank account. A business account would have some kind of protection on funds being withdrawn without notification (on the basis of services rendered etc), but IDK.
Wait and see I guess, you should definitely alert LBC admins if it you do get scammed.

Oh lord, I did something really stupid the other day which makes this seem sensible (at least OP's mistake might recover), I bought 10LTC at £18 each the other day (don't ask, for some reason when I went to buy only those results came up on the sellers list, and I assumed the price was rocketing). And then I decided to transfer them to OKpay (which I'd just started and assumed had wallet functionality), turns out, that it does, in GBP. It converts the LTC to GBP at market price (around £5), so I ended up converting £180 to £50... Fail.
Oh well, it was a good learning curve (read the small print!), and I'm still well ahead on my BTC investment, still feeling a bit dumb though.

and lots of redditors howling at the moon?

I've never had a problem with localbitcoins (UK here), apart from trying to trade on their slow servers when BTC trading is busy (last few days), risk is inherent in dealing with private sellers, and not an exchange like MtGox. Only thing you can do is only use sellers with good rep/a number of trades to their name.
Saying that, it may not have been the best idea to trade all $7k+ in one go, especially if it was a seller you hadn't used before. At least do a trial payment first ($1k or so), so you can check the legitimacy and transfer times.
Tbh, I do have some minor initial sympathy for the seller here,  if someone only initially transfers some of the money, not all of it initially, and then comes up with a 'bank limit' excuse or similar, that would raise red flags to the seller of being scammed by the buyer.
No sympathy for the seller after he received all the funds though (but it does seem unlikely that he is trying to deliberately scam you - a scammer is unlikely to open a dispute, its perhaps more likely that he thinks that he does have a case).
Also, why are you trading in AUD, not EUR if you're resident in Germany? It is *local*bitcoins after all, designed for quick/immediate trades between national banks.

Bugger. Fixed.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:34:07
Overall year on year trend is still massively up. No worries here.
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:16:49
Ah, ok. Good luck though. Has there been any update?
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:49:51
You have spent $900, and got back $600. You are at -$300 (+2BTC). You haven't made any profit.
BTW, as far as I can tell, bitcoin trading profit would be taxed as capital gains. In which case, you aren't due to pay anything in tax until you make gains/profit (difference between what you spent and what you sold at) greater than the tax-free allowance, currently at £10,600.

Seems fine for MtGox price.

Its still twice the value of what it was two weeks ago... Saying that, I'd totally be buying right now if I hadn't left my wallet at home (need my card details to access my bank account). Here's hoping it continues to drop for another 5 hours!

Someone really needs to make a sticky post for this, it gets asked pretty regularly. Also @_date: 2013-12-09 13:25:56
Best I can do is 0.000420

Point about the media coverage: It is mainly centered on the headline grabbing rise in value, and doesn't really concentrate on the actual benefits of bitcoin as a currency (in fact its quite negative a lot of the time, linking it to Silk Road etc).
For long term growth then stability/'non-bubbleness' the benefits need to be pushed more in the media.

If you have a receipt from LBC, print it off and go to the bank? It might count for something (if you get scammed).
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:54:39
Yeah, depending on where you sell them, you can probable get between £4600 (big exchange) to £5040 (localbitcoins) for them. If I were you, I'd sell £460 worth and get back your initial investment.
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:48:34
It's a currency, not shares. You can buy any fraction you want.

So you're suggesting the approach that is used in calories? ie. the amount of calories in food is actually in kilocalories, but reported on boxes etc as calories. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:51:35
Its already back above $1,000...

Dude, its your wedding. As exciting as bitcoins are, I think you'll have other things on your mind.
Also, potentially annoying your partner by disappearing off to chat about finances on your wedding day may not be the best way to start your marriage. Not to mention the fact that people would probably have already bought presents and asking for more on the day (especially cash) might make people uncomfortable.
Basically, another time may be more suitable.
Congratulations and good luck!

...Yeah, lets not get btc-e banned. Last thing we want is Putin taking an anti bitcoin stance and the site getting shutdown as a byproduct.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:27:06
Yeah, seems to be up again now. Odd, no mention of planned downtime on the site.

This is me waiting for tomorrow (payday), I've already spent all my usable income this month.

a) wrong subreddit (might be better)
b) against subreddit rules

People have been banging on about an S-curve, meaning that it will stabilise in a bit, then rise again a bit later before stabilising at a much higher level representative of the long term value of Bitcoin. A lot more market penetration is required though.
