You have a St Kitts passport, not a Japanese passport. Why you tried to prove to them that you had 9 years of history in Japan is beyond me. 
And re: your lawyers, they were obviously very shit at their job.
Suck it up Libertard.

I wouldn't touch your BTC with a bargepole. I have far too many principles.
Why pay 50BTC when you too can use google to find threads on forums where professional IT experts are discussing how this happened? Are you too fucking lazy to google?

It's on hosting provided by MtGox (or at least used to be until recently)
... and no, I'm not joking. lol

What I do not understand is that Theymos was running an old version of SMF, and that he hadn't patched up the vulnerability since the CosbyCoin hack.
Anyone with 5 minutes of google skills could googled for this vulnerability, and anybody over the past few years could have grabbed a copy of the database, or injected stuff into the database.
All those accounts that were hacked, and regular members who suddenly became scammers? Yup.
Thanks Theymos.
Why don't you use those 6000BTC in donations and the vast amount of money you get in advertising to patch up your system?

Thermos, did you apply this patch?  back in February?
