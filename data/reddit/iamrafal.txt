I dont get it. Could you ELI5?
@_date: 2015-09-22 11:18:16
I get all of this. 
But would it not be simpler to develop this marketplace without *special* hardware?
I don't really get what is the use of the hardware itself besides mining few satoshis? Could you ELI5 on this?

There are no simple steps or a to-do list that will guarantee success of your crowdfunding campaign. It's a combination of great product, marketing strategy and people behind all of this.

If Im understanding correctly he means it's against the freedom of sharing. When you incorporate money into sharing, you remove altruism which was one of the base concepts of BitTorrent...

It depends on where you are applying to. I am listing bitcoin as my passion and hobby, and include in my portfolio software I have developed using bitcoin technology.

Thats one of many absurds in our financial system...

Actually, it is (mobile dev here). Please do not be mean and pushy.

Yeah, their API reliability sucks badly. Do you know any alternative with batch transactions?
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:14:22
I have read what you have written all over again and finally understood. Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-09-22 09:26:37
Exactly. Id love to develop different solution on their marketplace api (eg mobile app) but without opened source it's impossible. So where is this whole "developer friendly" solution of 21?

It's a shame the contest has ended so long ago as I would submit our game, Bitween :) nevertheless, looking forward to news about Coinding!

I'd love to use the threats card and make a better software then. It' a shame 21 is not open sourced!
@_date: 2015-09-20 13:40:01
they don't have dev power needed to do that, it's written in comments above

You are stepping on a very thin ice with gambling laws and with Google Play. I've had skyrocketing app on Google Play that was similar to yours (bet who'll win in trivia quiz) and it was removed in blink of an eye.
Hope it will not happen to you and holding my thumbs for your success! :)

A lot depends on the price of the device, if it costs as much as iPhone you should not bother. If you got it for free the only thing you should decide on is whether setting up this whole array of devices to mine is worth couple of bucks mined...
