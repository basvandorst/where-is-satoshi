That's u/CSharpSauce's point

Lol. You're making a lot of assumptions amigo. I'm not a BTC or BCH maximalist. From what I can tell it seems they both will have value and serve different purposes for quite some time to come. I hold both coins and expect them both to do well in 2018. My point is, they made a blanket "sometime in the next 4 or 5 months" type of statement with no follow up. Yes, all of us that knew to be expecting it obviously knew it was coming soon. But to the rest of the world, they just flipped a switch. One that strongly smells of fuckery

That was an email from almost five months ago.. and it was in response to an uproar from users demanding access to their BCH. Then all this time goes by and with not so much as a days notice, they drop it.  Funny how others markets were all abuzz with BCH buy orders this morning prior to the announcement. People's BCH buy orders would often land and immediately be off the first page of orders due to the volume and extreme price pumping immediately outbidding previous bids. Coinbase's decision to release support in this way was not done on a whim. It had a clear motive.  It made a lot of people, myself included, lose confidence in them as a trustworthy institution

It’s more of a subscription based payment system

Does Gemini own BlockFi?

Could this be used to have a set of coordinates resolve to your wallets recovery key phrases ?

If you still have the drive there’s a chance for recovery

Many places offer cash discounts. Especially gas stations. Most places are just lazy and uniformly pass these fees on to all customers

That’s ridiculous. Maybe the dude you paid is being monitored for suspicious payment receipts? Literally all the Venmo comments my friends leave have to deal with sex or drugs or generally illegal and ridiculous activities. “For all that illegal sex and cocaine after the robbery. Good times!“. Never once got any emails or heard of any body getting them until your post 
Edit: spelling

You nailed it. Despite this dip, nothing about what makes crypto revolutionary has changed. Dips have occurred and recovered wonderfully when BTC was still somewhat obscure.  Now the scene has exploded. Even during this bear market, projects and big money institutions have been advancing towards the future of crypto. Look at coinbase as an example. They’ve spent this down time prepping for the next wave. I tend to believe there is plenty of cash on the sidelines waiting to step right back In when the time is right. This is what, the 300th time BTC has died ? Pay no mind, friends.

Yeah, I just got a burried reply of mine from a day or two ago get responded to by an account that was created today (Thanksgiving in the US), and that same account has made ~15 anti BTC posts already. All with very similar phrasing. Suspicious to say the least

This is not a dead man’s switch. A dead man switch is something that requires active engagement at a given interval and will automatically occur when/if the person stops doing that active engagement (e.g. if the person dies). Like a grenade with the pin pulled, it will only blow when the person lets go of it
