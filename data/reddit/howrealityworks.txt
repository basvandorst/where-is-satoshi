Bitcoin.com supporters are r/bitcoin supporters too. Our Eco system should be openminded to different roads to success and thus accept the weaknesses of your own ideas. 
Learn from each other, leave no space for arrogance.

linger? He means "Thrive!" 
This is because there won't be an Euro or USD around to linger along the mooning Bitcoin.

To open and close a channel, to go on Chain, you still have to pay the actual transaction fee. 
To buy new Bitcoins, you still have to pay the fee.
This so called good news, is so bias.

Charlie is backstabbing his friend, who got him into the space. Teached him about Bitcoin, even gave him money to survive bad days. 
Charlie, karma is going to hit you hard.

We've had this discussion back in 2015, it'2 2018 now. We'll have this discussion in 2020. Meanwhile: blocks are unusable full. Meanwhile: Bitcoin market-cap dominance below 20%, meanwhile: Bitcoin below top 5 CC

Indeed, it's puzzling how people still deny that the full blocks are devastating to Bitcoin.

one day both wings of Bitcoin Eco System embrace each other, instead of mocking and chasing tails.

How do you deal with transaction fee? And how about confirmation time? 
@_date: 2019-12-29 09:41:04
First we had to educate the p2p power of Bitcoin, now we have to educate them that IF the price moons again, wait a few weeks for the transactions come trough. Don't panic meanwhile, just hodl.

Not recommended to risk a tx with this low fee. Show the tx ids to proof this statement.

100% that the USD, Euro, or any kind of fiat will loose value. 
So, invest what you would spend on beverages or useless hobbies. Don't invest all of that, just consider Crypto as a new hobby among the others. Invest with the same frequency as you would pay for the other hobbies. 
I guarantee you, you will love Crypto more, because you'll understand better how it was to be a slave. 
Good luck, be careful.
Best win is that you'll gain knowledge

Dude, I've family living in countries where people earn 2 usd per day. 
Bitcoin is for them too, right? Well, then we have to bring down the tx fee. 
Wake up. Hate to say it here, but I've been banned with my other accounts for bringing this issue up. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:15:01
nice. Still lots of clueless people out there who know nothing about Bitcoin, or just trolls.

The 1 MB cap is crippling Bitcoin, how is this fact an opinion?
Remove the cap completely, you'll see a blooming eco system to building services and products, in both software and hardware, both in memory and calculation. The Eco system is hunger for growth.
We all know the small cap fans don't see this. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 06:53:16
I can't see how this post is helping the community. Disqualifying the other side of the discussion is harming both sides. If your goal is harming the Eco system, sure keep on bashing other sides. 
We should recognize that both sides want to scale, the stalemate took crypto centuries already. Best way now is to educate and help newbies how to deal with the coming upgrade of the network, either way of the discussion. Be fair about both wings. 
Good luck.
PS: Own your private key, keep it cold storage and wait this upgrade out. Don't jump into alts, they are sharks waiting for panicking newbies. They will pump to charm you, then dump the shit out of you. 
**Best advice: Private key in cold storage!**

smaller than fee?
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:03:50
Are they the real early players in Bitcoin? I understood they hold lots of Bitcoin, perhaps they really want Bitcoin to succeed and small blockers are just trolling around, not holding any bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:39:54
Adam never believed that Bitcoin would work, he said it publicly. Now he's in a team that is actively keeping Bitcoin in small blocks, we all know that it's crippling the usability of Bitcoin. In other words, he is leading a team to make sure Bitcoin won't succeed and this proofs him right, when he said it publicly.

HODL, if you're long term investor: get your btc into cold wallet, and your full time job is to find a nice destination to retire.
