If your goal is currency exchange for travel or extreme anonymity, another option is to simply sell Bitcoins in the destination country upon arrival. A site like localbitcoins.com can aid in that cause.

 *The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network will continue discussions with the Bitcoin community after meeting with the Bitcoin Foundation and a host of regulators and law enforcement officers in Washington D.C. today.
“Fincen often acts as the bridge between regulators, law enforcement and the financial industry,” says Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of Fincen, in an emailed statement. “Fincen regularly conducts this type of outreach and encourages dialogue between interested parties.”
The agency issued guidance on virtual currency in March, although it did not specifically name Bitcoin.
However, the Bitcoin community has felt the heat of the regulation. As Bitcoin businesses try to become compliant by registering as money services businesses (MSBs) and obtaining the proper state licenses, banks have abruptly dropped their accounts. And recently the New York State Department of Financial Services issued 22 subpoenas to emerging payments players, many of which handle bitcoins.
Still, many bitcoin companies are confused by parts of the guidance. For instance, Fincen classifies Bitcoin miners, or the users in charge of keeping the official record of Bitcoin transactions, as MSBs likely because miners are the first people to receive newly created bitcoins.
Today's talks didn't change Fincen's stance: “Fincen’s recent guidance concerning virtual currencies made clear that virtual currency administrators and exchangers that provide services within the U.S. must register with Fincen as money services businesses and that they share similar regulatory responsibilities with other financial institutions,” Calvery says.

current rate = last trade
since the market constantly moves, the "exchange rate" is whatever the rate the last trade (literal "exchange") took place as. order book depth isn't taken into account.
however, that will fluctuate constantly, so depending on your situation, it may be better to calculate VWAP (volume-weighted average price), which is the average of trades times volume for a given time period. for example, you could sum, by hour, each trade's price times volume. divide that total by the volume over the same period, and you have VWAP at a resolution of 1h.

Got mine through CampBX far cheaper than MtGox, so would have preferred to use them for numerous obvious reasons. MtGox resumed, traded while I could, so sent a little more to MtGox expecting my KYC verification to take quoted 2-3 days, especially as people may be exploring other exchanges. I check my CampBX account now, and magically my limit is already lifted. *gah* So now, I guess, I'll initiate transfer of (now much lower) balance to CampBX.
MtGox you foil me again!
**edit:** Dwolla transfers moving VERY fast into MtGox. 40 minutes and it just showed up. C'mon CampBX!

Yes, but only until ASICs saturate the market, at which point more efficient ASICs will come out. For the foreseeable future, it's going to be a continual game of technology cat &amp; mouse, which is why we've already gone from CPU-&gt;GPU-&gt;FPGA-&gt;ASIC

I don't know that this is the best solution, because it essentially would allow anyone to spam small transactions, force lag, then lock out all "small" players. This becomes especially problematic as value rises.
You want to deincentivize rapid transactions, not small ones, so a rate limit or per-transaction fee would be more effective in accomplishing that goal.

The move to ASIC isn't any different than the move to GPU or FPGA.
By distributing high hash rates around the network, it can actually serve to secure the network by making it extremely difficult to overcome those ASIC miners maliciously, i.e. evil governments and/or corporate entities.

There are people (especially on the bitcointalk forums) calling for a move to mBTC or some other fractional default. As BTC approaches $100 USD/€100 EUR, more people are incentivized to move away from BTC as the primary unit.

This isn't stricktly true. Since all value is recorded in the blockchain, those 90 coins still exist. Just no one knows the private key to access the value.
i.e. if you lock $1,000 in a safe and throw away the key, the money isn't lost. just no one knows how to access it.

This is not the experience I had. Assuming created account on Day 1, I transferred funds to MtGox on day 6. Then again on day 16 and again on day 27. Since then, I've been beyond the 30 day window and have made numerous transfers.

Saving 3-5% on credit card transactions feeds isn't enough of an incentive?


This may be true for risk-averse businesses, however, some are willing to take that risk or at least mitigate it by using BitPay, which allows clearing to fiat nightly.


Bitcoins are infinitely divisible. Would it make it sound better if we started using mBTC instead? How about uBTC? Satoshis?


Chargebacks are largely a Western concept. The rest of the world seems to do just fine with cash-like transactions.


The benefit may be for the customer, not the business. Like paying with cash.


Since when is liberty a bad thing? Governments can *try* to regulate Bitcoin, but it's unlikely to happen due to the worldwide nature of it. FinCEN recently provided *some* guidance. Pay your taxes and you should be mostly worry-free.


Not sure where to begin with this, because you're trying to make several points. If Bitcoin gains a foothold, I'd be surprised if Bitcoin banks didn't pop up. Of course, you're trusting your money to someone else. Not everyone likes that.


You mean like how no one would buy VHS because that's what the porn industry went with? There may be a stigma now, but as legitimate transactions overtake illegal ones, the stigma will fade.


I don't think your average business deals with exchanges. Mostly banks...


BitPay, Bitmit, and Bitcoinstore beg to differ

If you're in the US, Dwolla has let me move thousands of USD to both MtGox and CampBX without ever having to leave home. Unfortunately, you'll need to reveal your identity for this convenience.
As a slight aside: if it was trivial to move fiat currency onto the Internet for near free, I suspect Bitcoin would have less of an appeal to some due to that problem already being "solved". Hopefully that difficulty of moving fiat serves to underscore the usefulness of Bitcoin.

You can get dollars into the market without ever touching a Bitcoin through Bitinstant, Dwolla, and several other intermediaries.

My guess is not before Bitcoin ATMs start showing up... or an equally easy way to procure bitcoins.

For small purchases (i.e. under $100 USD), it's perfectly reasonable to accept the broadcast and 0 confirmations. The low value of such a double spend isn't worth the difficulty of the attack, much like it's not worth counterfeiting $5 bills to pay for a Starbucks coffee.
