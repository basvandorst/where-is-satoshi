thank you sir. You must be one of the top 'bitcoin minds', Blockstream version. How about your business plan?
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:19:19
How about a group of 5000 devs? This would be the minimum acceptable for any new currency. Wait. 100.000 devs, and we publish the finest working crypto.

bitcoin soul is decentralisation, not private organisation. Bitcoin is community oriented. Do you really think you are smarter than SN because he did not setup 'Satoshi and Son' ? Bitcoin success is due to its universality and openmindness. You really not working on the right coin.
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:49:07
if we accept SN mind as a bitcoin one, we might concede 'bitcoin minds' as decentralization adepts. SN was not essentially chasing VC capital, was he? How did you find the best bitcoin minds? How do you compare SN business plan to yours? Did you prepare your business plan before or after chasing the 'best bitcoin minds'?
Can you pinpoint any affinity between SN business plan and yours?

What is blocking the high level devs come with their better coin like Vitalik did? 
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:35:28
Nakamoto: " First General leaving the chain would be chained to the block by miners, until the mining of the LAST COIN".
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:13:12
Excuse me sir, are you a bitcoin dev? Well, i dont know. I do not have the bitcoin mind yet. Waiting for Core to have my mind verified. May be they let me through in the 95% list.
-Sorry , it is too late now.They just closed the list. Do you have a Segwit or similar badge?
_No, but i know a guy who have it.
_Too bad, really too bad.
@_date: 2017-02-27 02:22:13
Development in the future? Sure. But towards what? If anyone may consult Satoshi's white paper, we cannot say exactly what Blockstream identify as  ' bitcoin minds' . Is a miner's mind a bitcoin mind? Did satoshi himself had access to a 'bitcoin mind'? What comes first for the Blockstream project: the business plan or the 'bitcoin minds'. Who designed the blockstream project? Some fiat or bitcoin mind? I am very uncomfortable with the bitcoin project switching from a very clear path to the secret options of a private organization.

Like Bill Gates was really right: Bitcoin is more, really more than a currency.

BS team have so many coders they preferred waiting for SN to give them some work to do. One more coder and they invent the wheel.

The real challenge is to have this guy alive again, in case he would be dead. Just in case, what do we really need for that? No more than all the facts we may acknowledge him for.
May be this new Satoshi would give some hints about why he preferred working from the dark.

Voting is important. Voting for humans is childish: they failed so often in so many occasions. People should use the ballot for every important decision about this nation, instead of voting for single points of failure. Politicians do fail.
Voting 10 or 50 times a day, you do the president' s job. Surely better. Why? Because the president is and stay a human being with all the goods and bads. The election results will not turn him into a superman. How long it takes a society to understand that and take his power back?

segwit? Bitcoin protocol hijacking. Patenting over nakamoto work, centralization at higher level. You may try killing bitcoin, another protocol will emerge soon. It s already the end. Follow satoshi, or vanish.
@_date: 2017-04-05 09:22:16
Good developpers usually create good protocols, from the white paper to realisation. When a bunch of pirates arbor the segwit flag to sabotage someone's work, this is called conspiracy. When the pirates chief directly attack private property, this is called hijacking. Good developpers do creative , original work. They do not attempt to alter original creations.
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:34:56
it 's working? No explanation required. It is Bitcoin, with B, proof is embedded. Anytime you have to give 'proof of words' (??), it 's not Bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:11:54
Satoshi did not wait for devs association to propose bitcoin. He did not wait for VC money neither. Any dev association is just..bizarre. If you do not like the miners profile, go mine yourself. Fortunately, There is still room for devs to design other coins. Miners are tied to a protocol, and free to choose when to mine or not. Devs are free to code any protocol they want, fortunately.
@_date: 2017-04-13 15:50:57
Welcome to Bitcoin. Anyone can mine. Anyone can buy. Anyone can spend. Anyone can spam. Anyone can dream about new rules, pow not included. Anyone can mine, buy, spam, dream, without limits.
@_date: 2017-04-23 02:48:42
is clearer the coordinated action from another group of ppl to dismantle a carteL. SN against BS carteL.
@_date: 2017-04-03 23:18:38
i really like the core guys. A whole devs army working very hard to destroy the work of a single man: The Bitcoin protocol. I thought it could be easy for them to design their own coin. When they are not trying to wipeout satoshi's coins, they want to alter the protocol, because there are 'technical issues' in the Satoshi's whitepaper. I hope they hire a second devs army, not to destroy, but to create another coin. Good luck, Blockthing.
@_date: 2017-04-13 00:24:07
I really need some PoW. My Posts sometimes disappear...becoming empty blocks. You better patent this feature asap guys!
@_date: 2017-04-13 02:51:24
The problem with SegWit is because it always follows the Master. Nobody knows about the next Satoshi's move. So If you really want to be lost , follow segwit. If you feel like really creative, be a leader. Stop following the followers.
@_date: 2017-04-05 14:23:28
Satoshee: thank you for the wishes.you didn't ask for Bitcoin, did you? I know what you need now, and it is not segwit. Ugh.
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:12:31
To be simpler. I place the dev first, because we need to verify the hypothesis. Bitcoin is: the hypothesis, the proof, end the results.
Blockstream project: the hupothesis, the money( instead of proof), and the chaos as results. Let the devs verify and proof the hypothesis. Do not pour unproven facts into their throats, forcing them to swallow them
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:50:34
Who is going to swallow this? Segwit? The people? The people of which country? You really get it right as a new comedian!!
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:23:05
Welcome to Core heaven. Anyone can hook.
@_date: 2017-04-05 10:30:23
I thought you were aware of some important events about Bitcoin. Theymos, one of Blockstream chiefs, suggested to wipe out all Satoshi 's coins. Some attacks later, blockstream  proposed to alter the PoW protocol. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 00:12:37
this is not a big problem for your guys. People say you actually have the best think tank available through the visible universe. Goebbels tactics should be tackled in less than 1123 years.
@_date: 2017-04-06 18:24:48
Like all Core devs come out with a timestamp for identification purpose? Or kind of brainwashing or what? How do you recognize a core dev?
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:52:57
And it is normal. You cannot see it, because you never take the time to assert an hypothesis, and proof it against a truth table.
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:20:31
As soon as a dev works to several projects, are you going to name him dev-project1-project2-.....project65476? Rather impratical. A dev is a dev, period.
@_date: 2017-04-05 13:53:48
For your reference:
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:11:00
FYI, 'core dev' or 'xt dev' or whatever dev is pure nonsense. A real dev 'must' be a free thinker. Even specific languages would not tie the dev mind for any reason.
@_date: 2017-04-08 20:58:01
easy. Very easy: create a segwit altcoin. I may buy some real quick.
@_date: 2017-04-12 21:52:55
Bitcoin: deep thinking. Zero VC. Delivered
Segwit: traditional thinking, troll army, millions VC: Sabotaging genuine bitcoin.

why did you create and let the hell going and going?
God 's answers: that is life. I created the heaven and the hell, and some eternities later, i created Satoshi and Blockstream/Core. That is life, my son.
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:05:51
Well. It 's a PoW world , my friend. Just show your proof of words.
@_date: 2017-04-23 02:59:27
The Boss is the bitcoin whitepaper. Any hijacker or hijacking organisation will be fought by the bitcoin community. BS devs are not following the bitcoin white paper, but the BS/Core 's buiseness plan.(otherwise they are not getting paid)
@_date: 2016-10-30 22:24:06
Anyone aware of bitcoin story may remarks Satoshi himself has never showed so much agressivity as Blockthing and Coredumb people are doing today. They enter a private home, put locks at the door, now are planning to have people paying to go inside. This is called highjacking.
@_date: 2016-10-31 02:40:50
Sorry to have an opinion before 7 days on reddit, the only reliable source on this planet to make up some thoughts.
You may ban people, but someone will tell you that the facts never die. Another troll will always remind you about them. Btw, how many reddit days did Satoshi live, before talking about your beloved project? Go on banning people, but u may not be able to ban the facts. They come back again and again, until you understand that the bitcoin concept is not about making money, it s about new way of life for you and me and everyone.
