It's great that James is learning about Bitcoin! I'm with coins.ph and this is exactly one of the pain points we are addressing. Hoping more Filipino freelancers can also learn about how they can get paid in bitcoin and actually save on fees.

If you have bitcoins, one way to do this is by sending the bitcoin payment as cash directly to the employee's account - this way the btc gets converted into php faster. The same way, your employee/s can just withdraw their salaries from the ATM. 
I'm with coins,ph and we have a product that does this in case you want to check it out:

Great point you brought up here. I'm from  -- let me share with you what we have studied and built so far.
“We saw overseas foreign workers paying anywhere from five percent to 25 percent to send money home with companies like Western Union and Moneygram,” Hose explains. “When their relative in the Philippines loses $10 on a $100 transaction, that’s equivalent to two to three days of work. We thought: with Bitcoin we can do it cheaper. We can solve a real pain.” 
To that end,  allows these overseas workers to send cash from anywhere in the world using Bitcoin and have their relatives in the Philippines get the money via a bank deposit (for no fee), door-to-door delivery (80 to 120 PhP fee, which is US$1.83 to $2.75), or via pick-up at one of their partner retail locations (50 PhP fee; US$1.15) in the Philippines.
