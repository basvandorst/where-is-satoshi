That is not true. The correct way to to mask the password. If its left like this above, then a hacker can easily see what your password is. Whats worse is that even non hackers are able to see the password if they have minimal web dev skills.

Seriously? Do me a favor and sign in to your gemini account. Before you do that check the network call that it's making. The endpoint is  just if youre wondering. If you look at the form data, they send your password in damn plain text, they dont even use any type of password hashing. I dont understand how you think this is safe.

That is correct

See earlier comment. Gemini sends the password not encrypted making it vulnerable from attacks. I honestly dont know why you think this is safe.

To say that im not a bright engineer or know how web developemnt works, I would say is false, since you don't know what i actively work on. So lets just leave it as that. 
On the other hand I want user to be aware of what Gemini is doing. So youre saying that the flaw above is not risky at all? Having the password show up as plain text as the value attribute? Check any "Good" sites, they atleast try scramble the password. 
By default, password type inputs shouldnt show the password as the value. 
So please, leave flaming out of this. Just letting everyone be aware

I contacted Gemini and told them that their login has a very critical security bug. They replied back to me saying they it's not an issue?!
I've been an engineer for quite some time now and the first rule is to never expose passwords into the DOM! This introduces multiple problem and makes it easy for anyone to get into your account.
