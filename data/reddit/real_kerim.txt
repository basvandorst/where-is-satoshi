With all the recent good news, why is the price dropping right now? It's down 12% in the last 24h.

Why would the big whales sell during good news? The prices ought to be jumping back up especially after the whole Korean deal is settled.

Yes. Unless you believe that Bitcoin is doing just dandy when gigantic online services like Steam ditch BTC. Just because the price is higher than last year or ever, doesn't mean Bitcoin's coming any closer to its actual goal: being a global decentralized adopted currency.

That statement alone is at best unverifiable and at worst plain wrong, as there has been commodity money way before any government existed unless you're one of those ancaps that have a very vague definition of what a government is.
\&gt; Cannot be inflated like paper fiat currency 
This one is at least half right. Bitcoin cannot be inflated or deflated through governmental monetary policy but Bitcoin is a fiat money. Fiat money is simply any form of money that has no intrinsic value (like commodity money), it needn't be issued or backed by any government (see: the Iraqi Swiss Dinar, that stopped being legal tender and lost government backing but was still used as fiat currency).
\&gt;  Please don’t lose sight of the bigger picture of the revolutionary nature of this technology and how it can benefit you and your children and your grandchildren........ 
No, it won't.

This is unrelated to 2017 but rather a discussion about Bitcoin in the long-term.
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:01:59
Are you honestly getting your education on national and global economy from Twitter? That guy can barely write one sentence without a mistake.
Deflation is bad for the economy. Ask Japan how happy they feel about their deflationary currency, they've been trying to inflate the JPY for over 2 decades now. Everybody looks at inflation from the point of view of the people who hoard money (not assets but actual money) and forget that while inflation causes the loss of a little purchasing power for those hoarders, deflation would lead to their unemployment and even greater loss of purchasing power. The people Paul is talking about are the first ones who are let go once revenue streams dry up due to people refusing to spend their deflationary money.
Do you know any other deflationary currencies that people refuse to spend and are HODLing because they believe it will be worth more in the future?
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:34:08
In analogy to Bitcoin:
When presented with the opportunity to pay with Bitcoin, hodlers generally refuse to use Bitcoin as they believe it to be the superior currency (or to be currently undervalued) and use an alternative instead -- generally their country's legal tender.
This prevents Bitcoin from gaining any sort of momentum through circulation and adoption, which is exactly what it needs. Companies like Steam then start removing their Bitcoin support again, because it's pointless.
Bitcoin puts its users in a paradoxical situation. If one believes in Bitcoin's adoption and that it will appreciate in value, then spending it is stupid. But not spending it is actually preventing it from being adopted and gaining in value.
This paradox cannot be resolved unless some government starts forcing its nation to use Bitcoin as legal tender.
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:39:00
I'll be honest and just say it: I don't give a flying fuck about Bitcoin's technology or its adoption or anything. I just want it to gain in value when I long and lose in value when I short. 
I'm pretty sure almost everybody here thinks the same but they're pretending hard.

Literally any commodity. 
A fixed supply doesn't imply an increase in price. That argument is garbage. If supply is constant demand has to increase to increaee the price.
E.g. It doesn't matter if there's only one of you, because If nobody wants you, you're still worthless.

If by popular vote you mean demand then that's true only if supply is fixed.


That's literally the definition of fiat currency but if you tell Bitcoiners that Bitcoin is a fiat currency, they lose their shit.

If your focus is privacy, then fixing in which currency you buy your poptarts is a very inefficient way.
@_date: 2019-12-18 06:13:43
It's still technically a fixed supply. There is a finite amount of pretty much any commodity. 
Aside from that a fixed supply doesn't imply an increase in price. That argument is garbage to begin with. If supply is constant demand has to increase to increaee the price. To expect a price increase just because there is a fixed supply is retarded as fuck.
E.g. It doesn't matter if there's only one of you, because If nobody wants you, you're still worthless.

I can comprehend that it's beside the point.
@_date: 2019-12-14 13:53:26
It can be. You can definitely employ scientific rigor to economics but it's just incredibly difficult because there are so many variables. Creating isolated experiments like in physics is near impossible. As such many economic theories don't have the same predictive power as theories in hard sciences.
Do note, that many of the hot topic issues in physics can get very philosophical and be somewhat detached from empiricism and that goes for economics too. A lot of economics is just philosophy and axiomatic reasoning completely detached from reality. Check out Mises' (Austrian school of thought) statement:


@_date: 2018-11-24 22:24:02
It's pegged as in even when Bitcoin is accepted as a payment, the price of the product isn't simply *n* Bitcoins but rather however BTC make up the fiat value. The video's analogy to gold is unintentionally apt in regards to how neither gold nor Bitcoin are currencies.
Someone paying in BTC is like someone paying in gallons of water and saying, "This is going to be worth a lot in the future". The statement might be true some time in the future but today it's dumbfuck bullshit.

@_date: 2018-11-25 14:23:28
I hope you didn't actually pay for that course because this has nothing to do with supply and demand. 
Before you start yapping about how Bitcoin is finite and as such the price can only increase, that's a fallacy. Something being finite or even rare doesn't mean it's automatically worth more. It won't matter how many Bitcoins are left if nobody cares and there's no demand. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:13:54




Gee, such improvement.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:39:53
No. The current market cap is at around $135B, so 85K per Bitcoin would raise that to over $1.5 Trillion, which is more than the U.S. economy's entire exports value.
That's never going to happen unless businesses and gigantic corporations start buying Bitcoin in bulk.
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:13:50
"Come back in the future", is my answer when someone tries to pay me in Bitcoin. Maybe in a 100 years something like Bitcoin might be the world's currency but all the Bitcoin tards of today will be dead holding bags. 
During our lifetime Bitcoin will never be a currency of its own but always be pegged to some fiat like USD or EUR.

If you believe in Bitcoin and believe that it will appreciate in value, it's stupid to spend it. If you don't believe in Bitcoin, it is stupid to buy it. Bitcoin is in a weird situation. Those who spend their Bitcoin now are essentially sacrificing their purchasing power to help hodlers. I made a post outlining this a few days ago but people didn't understand it and turned it into a shitfest.

Where does the "by decree" come from? Fiat means to let something be but if you look into the Romanic languages like Italian, it's not "let it be [by decree]" and more like "let's say it is", which makes sense because fiat money only has the value the people who engage in exchange say it has. A government cannot (more specifically do not anymore) decree their currency be worth a specific thing. Things like hyperinflation would be impossible if they could.
On top of that you're putting fiat money and legal tender into an equivalency, which is wrong. Legal Tender does not have to be fiat money and fiat money doesn't have to be legal tender. I could print my own fiat money and people might even use it as currency but it'd not be legal tender.


Bitcoin is fiat money but not legal tender.
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:48:46
This is nonsense. You don't need a a central government in the modern sense to have fiat money. People used canine teeth as currency even *way* before central governments as we know it existed knowing that those things had no real value to them but simplified exchanging goods. 
Fiat money by definition means money without intrinsic value that's used for exchanges of goods and services. The opposite of fiat money is commodity money, which Bitcoin isn't. 
Stop spreading nonsense because you declared war on them evilz fiat monehs.
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:30:48
The same goes for gold, which is why it always confuses me why Bitcoin supporters have a hard-on for  the gold standard.
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:29:25
Nice non sequitur. It doesn't mean the definition is pointless, it simply means that we're moving towards a world that has very little intrinsic value. Of course anything can have value, a digital picture of your mother might be very valuable to you but for everybody else it's worthless and useless. If it were a poster, one could at least burn it for heat. 
So the argument still stands. Bitcoin is (trying to be) a currency with no intrinsic value and is by definition a fiat currency.

Yes, and the common definition for "fiat money" means money without intrinsic value that's used for exchanges of goods and services. 
The German definition especially is very streamlined:

What a stupid statement. Intrinsic value means that the item has some sort of use for the holder even if the perceived market value disappears. At the very very basic level intrinsic value is the expendable energy the item holds.
Beanie babies used to have very high market values. They were a commodity with which you could buy stuff, thus commodity money. Until their price plummeted and now they're virtually worthless but they can still be used as toys, decoration or heat by burning if necessary.

There are no tangible assets behind BTC. Investing in stocks would make you part owner of a business with assets, talents, liabilities, etc. You can let the the business run along or try and sway the executives and/or other stockholders to a different direction. With bonds you're a creditor to whatever entity issues the bond.
