Actually that’s a very bad comparison. 
It’s more like a very broad road that is artificially restricted to one line by the authorities. The artificially created jam is directed to another line which will be taxed by „lightning toll houses“. 
Ironically, there are people on the road who are blaming the trucks(e.g. coinbase) for the traffic jam instead of the authorities. 
Sounds weird to me.

And here comes the hate again. Addressing problems is always FUD and everything will be fine in the future. Typical brainless assumption without argumentation.
There is a problem and bitcoin is unusable for common transactions recently. The fees and transaction times are hilarious high. This no FUD.  This is sadly a fact. If you don’t know it, you don’t use it!
Here is a group of people that are not interested about bitcoin itself and are only seeing it as a investment. That’s why they are not interested in bad news or technical aspects. They just want to get rich quick, post memes, spam their hodls and shitpost to everyone who wants to initiate a discussion. Bad news are bad for the mood. 
It is a waste of time to discuss with them.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:00:37
I guess that’s your way of saying: „Yes, you are probably right, it won’t be easy to move these funds in the near future without a huge loss.“
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:48:42
It seems I kinda hit the point if you are getting so aroused and excited.


This is what you feel when reading about high fees and transaction times?? Thats not my problem If you are getting so upset about it.


If you use it every day you should add up your monthly costs in transaction fees, pls tell me. Or just show me the tx id of your latest transaction and lets see together how cheap and fast they are.
The most optimal fee? For me the most optimal fee is less than one cent per transaction, not multiple dollars
That makes a lot of sense now, if you dont care about losing value on each transaction. You must surely see my argumention as FUD. 
The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 410 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 92,660 satoshis.
Quite expensive to me.


Bitcoin is not a currency. Actually it is a very bad currency. Far to variabel in its value. You can not use it whereever you want. Maybe you should look up some terms you are mentioning. And it is also far away from beeing a good store of value, money is so much better. If you care capable to understand an easy sentence you should look what a store of value should be.


Bitcoin is only a highly specualtive asset anymore.


You must very narrow minded. I adressed multiple times my concerns about the high fees and sadly these are facts as you can read above. If you dont want to see the truth just keep on cheerleading. 


It seems I got the point there. You mainly see it as an asset of investment. If things works out for you, thats good. But dont try to cover that you are not interested in seeing bitcoin in terms of peer to peer electronic cash system. What it meant to be. It is so obvious. Therefore you are one of the kind of persons I adressed before. You must be very mad that you are so predictable.
Feel free to post another wall of text, but dont expect an answer to your ignorant, pointless hate speeches.

Litecoin is expensive too. Bcash beats litecoin in case of transaction cost.
But Iam not interested in discussing altcoins. I want bitcoin to succeed.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:30:37
So?! This doesn’t matter. We lose marketshare very quickly. It sadly just works. 
The retail shop at the corner wants an easy way to sell their goods with a good user experience and low fees. They doesn’t care so much about the tech as long it is secure, fast, easy to use and gets you the hip attitude for being able to accept cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:32:52
The capacity is still larger. I don’t wanna talk about them, I just wanna know why WE stagnate in improving our capacity for so long.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:46:54
You don’t seem to get my point. At this moment ETH is clogged too und there are high transaction costs aswell.
I don’t want more transactions. I want a working system. I want a bitcoin which can be used by everyone by anytime with acceptable fees and transaction time. Everyone is looking for excuses why it isn’t working and referring people to other blockchains. Horrible argumentation for the bitcoin it should be.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:24:53
And what do you achieve if you don’t spend it?! You always will rely on fiat money. 
For me this hodl thing should not be the ideal of a bitcoin „user“.  
It turned from don’t daytrade to don’t ever use it.  A very strange change in ideals occurred the last months. 
Instead of changing the problems of the system we chose to change the purpose. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:54:30
Well at the moment it is not that smart because you can’t transfer such amounts without a huge loss.
It is like demanding a 0,001% of a dollar for something. The transaction is worth more than the subject.
For me it doesn’t make any sense at the moment to call it like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:59:28
I don’t want to support the ETH network by using it, but recently I had to use bcash to my funds and buy bitcoin, because it is too expensive to buy and move it directly. Sadly this works and it pended seconds after with costs smaller than 1cent and it got confirmed couple of minutes after. For me this is an argument that a block size increase does help at least momentarily. 
I find it very weird.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:55:26
If you want to invest in bitcoin be prepared for the transaction fees you have to face at the moment. Be careful. Many newcomers lost a lot of money trying to move around small amounts.
At first you should invest your time in researching the basics of blockchain for at least 2 weeks. That’s my investment advice.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:22:04
So here I‘m complaining about. I’m mainly a user and this is unusable. What matters to me is supporting the idea of transactions without governments and banks while having a good user experience. Other forks work, the mother chain sadly not. I want bitcoin to succeed.
Well you say this would be the same, I‘m not sure  about it.  The block size increases the amount of data transferred via block. For me that is quite simple to assume that it helps to fight a congested blockchain if you can increase the amount of data per block in the same time - simple math.
 And yes, this is actually transaction speed. Simply at it is.
Assumptions should be backed by arguments.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:50:04
So what. Stop look at others. We have a problem now, because bitcoin totally lost the ability to use it for frequent purchases.
Who cares about some random guys who are accepting it but don’t use it, because it is too congested.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:45:11
What are you even talking about! If you can’t keep up a proper argumentation without hates speeches and toxic behavior I won’t bother to discuss your point of view anymore. 
And you always bring up bcash, when some one is addressing about the problems on the bitcoin chain. That’s just weird. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:49:19
Iam not a big fan litecoin. I have bcash since August this year and after the eda update it works quite well for me. I can easy move these funds from wallet to wallet in a couple of minutes with fees smaller than one cent. Litecoin is way more expensive at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:43:37


Yes that is good. It proves that the blockchain is beeing used, nothing else. It doesnt proves the viability as a currency. If you have a current graph about Bitcoin payments processed by BitPay for example, let me know. 


The adoption as an asset grows, nothing else.
The merchant adoption stagnates. It is not usefull for smaller purchases. Some examples of merchants who stopped accepting it, because it is unviable: 


Where can I buy my groceries on coinbase? Coinbase is an exchange not a merchant. This proves again the adoption as an asset.
Thats all you have?
Still no arguments. Just hatespeech. Where are your arguments about bitcoin as a currency?
edit: formatation
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:15:02
In my opininion bitcoin is either a currency nor a store of value at the moment. It became a very lucrative investment option.
But if the current problems will be solved, it will become a pretty good store of value. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:29:05
Got no arguments? Better flame their english. 
Your average hodl-guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:12:37
You finally reached 95% bullshit level, lets scan this wall for some arguments again.


Which numbers? Where are numbers about the increasing **merchant** adoption? Show me. 


Yes and they worried about the disadvantages that I allready mentioned: transaction costs and volatile prices.


"In the future everything will be fine." Oh boy. You are so dense. We are talking about this right moment. Not in 3 years.


You played yourself again. You solved the problem by not using blockchain transactions. You use fiat money. 
You still dont come with one proper argument. Bitcoin is no currency yet. You cant use blockchain transactions to buy daily things. merchants abandon the chain. People want to get rich and buy in. Providers try to make this work, but it is not ready. LN is not even pre-alpha. Do what you want. Bitcoin is an asset **at the moment**, nothing more. You had enough time to even name on argument. 
I tried for so long to have a proper discussion but you are just into trolling and into baseless assumptions. 
You brought not one technical or fundamental argument to the discussion. It feels like talking with an edgy 16 year old. Making funny faces, south park quotes, insulting. If you keep your attitude no one ever will take you serious. You must be a very exhausting kind of young person.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:16:13
I dont care about the prices of certain altcoins. Just fill a word document with your assumptions.
I will just ignore your troll-like harassments and will just continue try to discuss the topic with you. Lets see if you are capable to do it.


Did I miss anything? You delivered nothing substantial to our whole little "debate".
So lets stay on topic and bring some **data** that supports that bitcoin is a viabel currency **at the moment**, not in 3 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:23:57
If you want to discuss about technical aspects of bch, you should consider looking for informations on some other sources than only this particular subreddit.
I would not take financial advices from people in a subreddit which are 40% into memes, 40% into brigading and hate and maybe only 20% into tech discussions.

@_date: 2017-12-14 12:46:45
If you are too young to a handle a wallet you should not buy cryptocurrencies in the first stage and blaming some random wallet for this is either bad. 
It is like the „thanks Obama“ meme when you slipped because you had your shoelaces lose.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:17:50
Your  way of writing just proves my argumentation. 
You are just harassing, pointing out spelling mistakes and ignoring facts. It is always nice to see when some of you guys are waking up and getting so angry about the truth.
80% of your walls are just sad attempts to defame the opponent. Come back when you grew up.
You don’t ever bring own arguments to your thesis, because you don’t even have on. You are just buying bitcoin, send them to your wallet and enjoy you sick investments skills. And you still manage to call this „using bitcoin as a currency“. That’s quite hilarious.
Iam sorry that I sent you a link to a website which I thought you might understand. But now I doubt you don’t even understand this. How you will understand primary sources!? Wikipedia is a good start into a topic you don’t know. That’s exactly what you need.
You played yourself.
5 Dollar isn’t cheap, and that’s not even the average. If you want to use it, feel free. 
I’ll stick to my zero cent cost transactions.

Soon?! Let’s chill together for another couple of months while we open tabs and bcash is getting more and more adoption because it is the only version of bitcoin that is sadly working right now.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:26:48
It is unusable for common transactions recently. I moved to other chains which are doing well.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:58:31
It is an open market. 
There are competing business models. Stop humanize cryptocurrencies. There is no brother, mother or whatever. Thus no coin or token has or hasn’t the **right** to do this or that.
If people wanna pump this, let them do it. If they wanna sell it, it’s their choice. The only thing you do is talking about it and promote it in that way.
Can’t understand how some of you can get so upset so easily. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:20:28
Yes, but it is open source. They are many other bitcoin forks that are even „backed“ by core developers, if Iam not mistaken.
Ver can literally do what he wants. If you want a closed system where you aren’t allowed to say and to promote the things for what you are standing for you maybe should have not joined the bitcoin community.
The only thing you achieve is to spread hate and intolerance and give him even more attention.
There are other opinions. You don’t have to agree but no one should forcefully try to silence them.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:35:42
Ye that’s good. That’s what I’m talking about. We need to use it. Otherwise it is rarely better than fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:05:38
I do not unterstand why some of us have to be so fanatic about different ideas. 
Stop spreading hate and beeing so overemotional. It makes the community looks childish and ignorant. 
Spread the good word for what you think is the right way. Try to argumentate with positive ideas!
Smear campaigns harm the whole community!
