From my perspective bitcoin is still ahead of its time, the general masses have no clue how email even works, let alone cryptographic hashing or why this bitcoin thing is useful compared to SDRs. They just see beer, tv, bills and cash.
I suspect that bitcoin will outperform any traditional currency over the medium and long term, because of the strict monetary policy it enforces and the low overheads of maintaining the system. It rewards saving. It rewards social trade. The thing about bitcoin is that it enforces a world where you only get out what you put in, whatever that might be.. it's all relative.
The planet is like a huge calculating machine, every bit, every interaction, every ray of light has cascading effects. Someone mentions bitcoin to a hotdog vendor somewhere in mexico, that leads to a kid getting bitcoin somewhere in indonesia, which leads to a shipping company ceo googling satoshi nakamoto. If you want it to happen faster, make more of these kinds of chain reactions happen. I've put up bitcoin posters in places where they make a difference, I've given away more bitcoin than I kept. I hope the rest of us do so too, thats the only way this will happen faster. By working for it.
@_date: 2015-12-20 10:10:58
Transactions on the bitcoin network are quite expensive. 
You had about 0.0003BTC worth of DOGE, so the transaction from your DOGE wallet to the exchange, then the actual selling of the DOGE, and then lastly the BITCOIN transaction to your wallet. Thats 3x fees. It's actually impressive that you managed to have anything left by the end of it considering your transactions were now carved into two blockchains for eternity (if all goes as planned)

Put another way **its a number on a screen that we can trust**. If all goes as planned.

To understand the future potential of the technology before its a reality in their day to day existence. 
To take email as an example. If you understood how electronic messages can be sent to an electronic mail(box) server in the 1960s you would've foreseen it to become widespread and the reduction in the usage of traditional mail and fax. So it requires a basic understanding of how remote server access works and domain name systems. DNS because it even forms part of the email address you need to type in to send a message to the correct person.
The people who understand how bitcoin works have a much better idea of its future potential and what people use today that will be made redundant. So to understand how bitcoin is different (and better) than traditional bank systems they'll need to understand that the wallet address is actually a cryptographic hash. If they make a typo they just sent money into the void.. its also very different from sending money using previous systems where they'd need to specify the recipient's name, account number, branch, and bank company name. Understanding the differences requires new understanding, new terminology and thus new technology to be understood and make sense to the masses.

Think about ordering a shipment of goods from another country, the money can be on the other end in 10minutes and spendable, which means they can start loading the goods immediately. Everyone gets paid quicker, so everyone is happier and more productive.
It's going to make companies more efficient, brings the costs down for the end consumer or more profit for the company and helps gain marketshare by being faster to market.

The seller could optionally add a location (gps lat/lon) so buyers can buy from local producers and search based on distance. This is different from something like coinmap in that it can record and place goods on a map. Very next level market stuff.
It would be cool if for instance people who produce a commodity, like milk or apples for instance, can be bundled when searching. So it forms something like a stock market for said commodity. 
Nevermind the delivery of goods at first, that is quite complex to tackle and can be left for the last bit of dev work.

As I understand it this MMM scheme switched to using bitcoin not too long ago, this led to an increase in volumes on localbitcoins and in general an increase in buying pressure on exchanges driving up the price. So people bought bitcoin to "invest" in MMM, now it sounds like shit has hit the fan and people are realising the MMM scam. So thus they would most likely stop buying bitcoin to send to MMM. Decreasing buying on the exchanges.
Who knows, its all hearsay IMO. Atleast more people got introduced to bitcoin through the process, sorry that people get tricked into scams like MMM though.

Yes (item == item) when item is both at the same time.

There are a few key insights you need to understand bitcoin, some of us take it for granted that we know these, but many average people would need them explained:
   
Peer to peer networks   
Cryptographic hashing
Permissionless innovation    
Programmable money     
I think the biggest game changer in 2015 was how stable the price was for months at a time. It allowed people to experience what a non-volatile cryptographic currency is like to use.
Secondary to this was how poorly the others did especially gold.
Q1: 1BTC = 0.15 ounce of gold = 200USD    
Q2: 1BTC = 0.20 ounce of gold = 260USD    
Q3: 1BTC = 0.30 ounce of gold = 330USD    
Q4: 1BTC = 0.40 ounce of gold = 450USD

I see no problem paying for roads, sewage, water, electricity and other needed services using bitcoin. It could make things better. 
They could stick an advert with a unique qrcode bitcoin address on my bin, they could say x amount per week of collection, I choose how much to send them, perhaps just the minimum for a pickup when it is really needed. They don't pick it up if I didn't pay. By doing the simple action of sending bitcoin to a wallet they know which bin I paid for and can probably figure out how to automatically pay the guy that ends up emptying the bin, driving the truck, servicing the truck etc... It's opt-in, simplified service.

A bitcoin transaction is a couple of bytes, this can be transmitted through any channel **in the open** and you are not risking your account details. As long as the data is transmitted to a bitcoin node at some point it should end up in the blockchain if it is verified to be valid transaction.
Sure it will be more complicated, but that is the nature of censorship.

We're moving towards renewable energy, the competition for efficiency is a good thing as it pushes inefficient players out of the mining industry. Saving the world resources and causing less polution.
Mining is also more efficient than having buildings full of people doing monetary policy.
Yes, the value of a bitcoin makes a difference to miners, last I've heard is mining a BTC in china is around 500CNY.  So thats plenty profit margin, and thats a good thing.
Total energy consumed by the mining network is irrelevant, the question should be what is the environmental impact and the incentives for competition in the BTC mining industry. We're trying to maximize security by decentralizing mining. The system is otherwise self stabilizing. Coins generated at a constant rate will either be hoarded or sold depending on the market prices.
The weight of moving paper and coins, sorting them, replacing them, guarding them is wasteful. And comparing mature fiat currencies to bitcoin while the monetary base is still being rapidly grown (9% inflation at the moment) is a bit rediculous. Once we're in the same inflation range as fiat currencies we'll be able to compare scale and costs better.
The energy isn't consumed for no reason, it's the only way we've found that consensus can be achieved. Proof of work is the latch we use to wrangle control over time and make spoofing votes impossible.

To do one person one vote you need a working identification system free from tampering. The only way I can see that working is biometric/dna cryptography. I think this could be harmful to freedom.
Instead of casting a vote, rather vote with funds by sending it to where you feel it is best used. Some people will have more votes because they have more resources. This is the nature of power.

If people run out of money they need some other medium of exchange. Bitcoin can be used then as a medium. 
So a farmer can say they want 0.0001BTC for an apple. The cheesemaker can say they want 0.05 for a block of cheese, now they have some way of trading if they wish. Of course there is nothing stopping the price of apples in Greece to drop to 0.00000001BTC but if they do I am sure someone will buy them and the price will rise. 
What I'm trying to say is that if the euros dry up, they'll atleast have a way of trading, it just depends on the price they are willing to accept. 1BTC can go a long way when it isn't siphoned off by middlemen.

Afaik its cost prohibitive to store low value information on the blockchain. A few cents per byte. Now, using the blockchain as a pointer to some torrentmagnet link or maidsafe distributed data makes sense. Though with a higher likelyhood of being lost.
Be more broad in the kind of data. Geeks on reddit aren't that interested in music events or theatre.. 
Some idea of data you'll need to store:
    {
    name: "some event thing",
    description: "come to this thing because...",
    gps_lat: "12.345",
    gps_lon: "-25.987",
    btc: "-0.075",
    timefuture: "1449143049555"
    }
I use JSON format here because it's nicely parsable, though not the best use of valueable storage space. If we have an agreed upon format for adding a wide variety of data to the blockchain it would be easy to create decentralized uber, ebay, craigslist, facebook etc.. though data entry cost is still high. Perhaps mining competition will help to lower cost of writing kb's of data to the blockchain.

I let my neighbours know that they can setup their own node and connect to me at some btc rate per MB, they can then choose to do the same and let someone further out connect to them and so on.
Tldr; meshnetwork. Allow people to connect to eachother as a cheaper alternative to existing broadband options.

My guess is data mining.

At a mobile penetration point of 7.2B people and a supply of 14M btc,  thats 0.002btc (2000.00 bits) per person. At 0.64USD now its not bad, but could go up a lot and we'll most likely have to add additional digits for finer transactions.
If the price stays stable with the inflow of new bitcoin, thats equal to 1250 people joining every minute (2.5btc / 0.002). I know that calculation is a bit arbitrary, but it helps to illustrate how much btc is being generated by mining. 
There's no alternative way around this creation of btc, atleast we know less btc will be generated the longer we go and just being able to keep the value relatively stable for now is great. And it has been relatively stable as we haven't seen orders of magnitude drops, but we have seen order of magnitude increases. 
When we pass the equilibrium point where btc supply inflation rate falls below the growth rate of the btc economy we'll see the price increase to keep up with demand.

Could this be used in existing fiat systems for record keeping? For instance I have a point of sale in a retail shop, I want it to record all transactions onto the blockchain, allowing my customers to have a digital receipt, as well as the company to automate accounting? Perhaps embed the serial numbers of goods etc, I'm guessing this would make the bitcoin blockchain grow in size too quickly if many merchants did this. So a sidechain that leverages the security of the bitcoinblockchain gives me a way to verify the correctness of my accounting, while not bloating the bitcoin blockchain?

I think we can all agree that more people are using bitcoin everyday? And I mean not just speculatively trading bitcoin and fiat, I mean trades that make the physical world better in some way, ordering goods and services.
So in that sense it does not seem to matter what the price of bitcoin is. If you need to buy something you get the appropriate amount of btc for the transaction and send it through, on the other end it is converted back to fiat. The end result is like you just converted your fiat from one country into the fiat of another and you can ignore the price of bitcoin as it is irrelevant. 
The important question to ask here is did both parties get a fair trade? I think at the moment there are noticable imbalances between certain international markets and these are increasingly having an effect as a kind of feedback loop causing more trades to occur and benefitting the party that is more efficient with resources, bitcoin trades occur if they offer goods or services that is not locally available for fiat or it is preferable to the customer in some other way.
To return to the price of bitcoin again and to reiterate. If I want to buy something over the net and the seller accepts bitcoin, I don't really care what the bitcoin amount is really, I'm looking at the exchange rate between my local fiat currency and the seller's asking fiat currency times the amount, this tells me if its a fair trade from my point of view or not. Bitcoin is simply the medium which enabled this teleporting and transmutaton of fiat. 
In this light, the buyer and seller only owns bitcoin for a few moments before someone else gets to use it again for their transaction. So in this sense, the price of bitcoin is dependant on per fiat exchange transaction volume times confirmation time. Ofcourse people can choose to hold onto the bitcoin, but thats not very useful. There is plenty of bitcoin left for others to use instead. It looks to me like owning bitcoin is like owning a slice of international currency exchange bandwidth,  similar to owning part of an undersea fiber connection.
While fiat remains the holding currency for the majority, the price of bitcoin will only rise when we hit a supply limitation, that means the available cheap bitcoin has become too little to transfer the information of  the fiat transaction. We are a long way from that, and I doubt we'll run into that problem before we see the result of bitcoin on the fiat exchange rates.
So, bitcoin is primarily used between the US, EU, CHINA.. it is picking up in developing countries. The most influential aspect is connecting the world markets without friction. So any differences in regulations or policies that affected the fiat markets do not affect the bitcoin markets (negatively only, if its more profitable to trade bitcoin than fiat people will). So bitcoin will put pressure on local markets to become competitive on the international level playing field as the effects of policy and regulation at borders become less effective.
This might cause some fiat currencies to be dropped in favor of bitcoin in countries where there forms a destructive feedbackloop where bitcoin effectively feeds off the inefficiency of the local fiat market that is burdened by corruption and over taxation.
Sorry for the long post. I am just speakign my mind, not a professional at this and this is pure speculation.

From in  although he talks about building cities at sea, most applies directly to bitcoin and decentralised society.
   
   


























At that point, our victory over the entire world's statist elements will be virtually certain. Our political norms will be exported round the world, even onto mainlands, without our even trying, because the masses will not want to pay 50+% of their income to governments when they can join an ancap legal system which costs a fraction of that at best, and gives people far more choice and individual empowerment.


It just costs money, time, and effort to build an ancap society, and then test out and mature our voluntarist replacement services of governance without government: police, courts, and law, and then watch the dominoes fall.
As governments the world over grow more oppressive, and double-down on their tax burden, they will chase their citizens into our open arms.

Do you have links to these articles?
I found that most people need a bit of time to absorb the idea of bitcoin.
To them it seems doubtful to work, the benefit is not plainly visible and they don't have the vocabulary or base understanding of the world's economic system to properly fit the concept into a worldview. They're used to working like slaves and would rather not question the system that provides them with the security they enjoy. 
From this perspective, try not to criticise doubters, rather help them by rationally discussing their statements, they might have insights into how we can improve on bitcoin. Afterall, it is not perfect yet.
Perhaps, instead of accusing, harsh criticism and telling this person to risk money on bitcoin. Just send them a tip with a tool like bitx (it allows you to send to an email address). This way they can test it out before writing badly about it.

Not a professional, but have a look at the nasdaq after the dotcom bubble of 2000. Its the closest that I know of.
Edit: As people buy in they help fund the deployment and convince investors in a dangerous feedback loop till it consumes its market at that time. Everyone that has the money to and knows about the potential profits get on the rocket. Driving up the price till theres no more fuel left to burn. Then it contracts as the pressure reverses in a selloff, trying to hold on to gains.
The bust after the boom is usually seen as bad, but actually its how the underlying market recovers and grows, redistributes and finds pockets of value to build on.

Not sure what to do on that page you linked. Best would be to ask your questions here.
At the moment it seems we're just waiting to find out what QE4 will do to the dollar. If they can really just keep the market up by issuing zero interest debt or if it will blow up the economy. 
Its a chicken and egg problem aswell. For bitcoin to become widely used it needs to be accepted everywhere directly. Rent, water and electricity, food, transport, salaries... that kind of shift will not happen easily. 
It's unclear at this moment if mobile payments are really more convenient than cash or card. Theres also harsh competition in this mobile payments space at the moment with a lot of incompatibility.

This. With the programability of bitcoin it allows the merchant to automatically pay the sales person a % of the sale and order stock (if their vendor can do orders through an api) to replace the sold goods without overhead costs.
So we are waiting for the globalization phase of the technology to catch up.

It is happening, but it takes longer than the "omg this means now we can do..." phase. Give it time :)

How do we know we really get the stock? 
Only way I can see this happening is some kind of hashing trick to seed wallet addressess. So customers only pay funds to the company through valid wallet addresses that are linked to the stock, so we are able to see the performance of the company.
Essentially we need a cryptographic way of ensuring all transactions of the company are visible to stock owners. Or some way of measuring performance and return on investment.

The potential freedom that bitcoin can give digital workers is the flood gate market. I'm talking about anyone that can produce value and transmit that over the web. Think coders, designers, digital film makers, heck probably even accountants or writers etc.. 
We need a film that shows people what bitcoin unlocks for them. The ability to react and get paid much faster. I'm seeing shots like:
A graphic designer at home making a tweak to something in a design, saving out and sending a file all while talking with his client on the phone and getting paid in a few seconds before ending the call.
A band plays a live gig, fans buy merch or digital album while in the crowd.
This to the moon thing deserves to be done. How would bitcoin make the process of gathering a team, resources and building a rocket easier and faster? I'd imagine you get different nationalities and show them working on different aspects, talking different languages but working together on the same project across the planet. Some people doing 3D design, others machining parts, others doing fuel tests, others coding and setting up communication dishes etc..

I think the measurement is equivalent USD transaction volume which has doubled from last year, it would be interesting to see what total transaction volume looks like this time next year, I anticipate 4 times what it is now. This is just from seeing the interest from people in my local community. What I found to help a lot to encourage others to experiment with bitcoin is to send them some. You can send directly to someone's email address which guides them through setting up a webwallet with 2 factor authentication.

You reply with wallet address for that message and a price in btc.

Many banks already do this with various reward points. In South Africa we have 
The problem they have is with wider adoption and this is because of the underlying technology and the limitations that introduces.
The public can not easily transfer these to other people.
The bank controls the servers that run their currency and can effectively make money from thin air, so the currency remains at a very low value. It is seen as not a real currency.
In many ways online banking is already what you describe. The problem is their complex old systems and regulations that make it all work, which will take a very long time and a lot of work to change to a realtime network.
Bitcoin does not suffer from these problems as the underlying technology is very different, and very simple actually. It is not run by a single institution, so people have more trust in it because they can run their own copy that checks everyone else. It can be programmed and automated easily and send money anywhere in the world without caring about redtape or compatibility to other side.

Simple (perhaps too simple) en passant BTC/fiat exchange is now possible. How this works is something like this. 
Person that is willing to trade fiat/btc at a certain location opens up  and goes to add his exchange marker. 
Person that wants to trade fiat/btc sees the marker in the area and goes there. 
At the moment this will require the exchange to have some kind of visible sign for people to see exactly who to talk to.

60 million people, mostly concentrated in the cities. Cape Town is on the level of London in terms of population and lifestyle, just cheaper. Crime is higher, but its a result of the imbalances in the economy, something bitcoin could help solve.
Infrastructure is somewhat good, but can't keep up. I've used BTC while on holiday recently and met up with many cryptocurrency fans, if you look at coinmap.org you'll see some of the businesses though many are not on there yet. 
Africa has huge potential for growth. Volumes on the exchange are around 100BTC on a business day and has doubled over the past 6 months. Regulators and banks seem open to BTC and they attended the recent  held in Cape Town. Brock Pierce from the bitcoin foundation, Vinny Lingham from Gyft and others were there too. See the speakers page of the conferernce to get an idea. I even met a guy from the national treasury and he seemed open to it. People are looking seriously at South Africa.

Automated micropayments for road taxation. The more people sit in traffic somewhere the more bitcoin is allocated to fixing and upgrading that part of the infrastructure.
Automated micropayments for education, pay for how long you are in class only, if the class is shit you can go. The best classes will gather more funding and expand.
Mobile payment freedom. When you can load up your mobile phone with some bitcoin and use that to pay for mobile services from any service provider, jumping between them as you please. It will help to load balance the providers, and make them super competitive as there is no friction to switching providers. Those same bitcoins can be used to buy and sell between anyone in proximity or in the world, with no middleman. 
Government accountability.  With all state departments wallet addresses public knowledge, we can see funds flowing through the system, coupled to a public budget it becomes less overhead to account for all state spending and at the same time providing a serious hurdle to corruption. Year on year data will allow automated distribution of funds to where most needed without people in the loop to mess things up. If funds are sent to an unknown address it will be easy to know who authorized the transaction (or which system is compromised), perhaps all large manual transactions at state level requires multi-signature and linked to public documentation of the project getting funded.
Renumeration at many jobs can become coupled to work performance more tightly. If someone's job is to pickup and deliver goods, they could be paid per delivery, per distance travelled and per customer feedback rating etc, encouraging the employee to do a better job because it is clear how it benefits him or her directly. Same for any job that has performance metrics that are measureable digitally and tightly bound to overall performance on the job.
Payroll does not need to be monthly, it could be daily or even event based. An employee helped a customer pick out a product at a retail store? Employee gets a percentage of the sale the moment it is made which he can now go and spend immediately, happy employee and happy customer.

I disagree, they allow you to send/receive tokens just like bitcoin, perhaps with less reliability. So there is utility.
Most would be profiteering schemes by their creators, yes. 
You should be careful when using the words "none" or "any" as they are very binary in scope.

The problem is that money can be printed at all. Thats like deciding that money is now some plastic object and only those lucky few with 3D printers have infinite money. They lend out printed 3D monies to others at interest, and when they lent too much and can't pay back we throw a hissy fit and demand payment by yelling louder. 
Just print more ECB. Cut your losses with Greece.
And Greece start using dogecoin or something.

It will come down to which is more efficient, similar to natural selection.
Fiat has the advantage of momentum and influence, it takes a long time to change the mainstream. On the otherhand, it's difficult to find someone excited about their bank, the masses are ready to jump ship if they are convinced its a better boat.
We have to admit that bitcoin has a pretty steep operating cost, all the miners vs salaried bank employees. But if a person's job can be automated by code its only a matter of time before it will be. 
The primary battleground is forex which averages at more than $5,000,000,000,000 of trade volume per day. Bypassing regulation and policy is probably the primary concern for those benefitting from the existing systems. Being able to trade bitcoin directly for goods and services at this point is almost a negligible benefit, as we can already do that with existing means. Interesting time ahead :)

I like the idea of reducing block time, but how far would that get us?  
10sec block time at 1mb per block gives us 60x increase or 36,288,000 tx per day.  
Perhaps thats possible in the extreme. 
I don't think its possible for us to architect something that is perfect, futureproof and able to handle all the people+devices transacting. At least not with current technology. It might have to be that we run multiple blockchains in parallel (almost like sidechains or altcoins), but as part of the existing bitcoin-core. Some kind of way to loadbalance and process multiple blocks in parallel by splitting transactions into groups. 
These groups could be based of the hash, splitting into groups based on odd/even, a-z or whatever. This would increase amount of confirmations you'd want again though..
@_date: 2015-05-18 06:57:11
This is so backwards. The lawyers don't understand that they are part of the problem if they stand in the way of you trading. We're trying to encourage global trade, not limit it unnecessarily. 
Of course use your common sense and don't enable lunatics that would cause harm by giving them bitcoin. If you sell bitcoin to people, and the police come to you later saying that the bitcoin was linked to a crime you would probably need to give them a lead to follow up on.

"We're going to have the ability to have users come to the site and just buy 25 dollars worth of bitcoin with a credit card."

The only problem I see is the tx limit.. if that gets solved then this all makes sense and its quite clever. 
The cost of putting a miner into every device would be relatively low. We are entering an age where we'll have energy abundance (hopefully) and a net surplus in energy that we won't know what to do with. So might as well mine hey.

Set the graph options to use ZAR equivalent, perhaps I should have used USD for you guys.. 
Overlayed using photoshop and colorized each graph. So China is red and South Africa is green. You'll see that towards the end the local price is way above the curve. 
So it is either that the local market is in a bubble and overpriced, or the local currency is losing buying power?
EDIT: Had a look at the ZARCNY exchange rate on  and then aligned the data to the same time period to the day. 
It looks to me like there is correlation?
**The forex rate of CNY per ZAR climbed 9% from 25feb to 13march. 9 percent in just over 2 weeks for a national currency!.. you'll see thats when the divergence really kicked off between the charts as well.**

On the order book right now you can dump almost 70BTC to get it down to the same level as you buy it for internationally. (exchange rate according to xe.com).

@_date: 2015-05-02 10:05:44
To clarify. There's no issues once I have the BTC, buying and selling locally is reliable. The problem is international transfers from the south african banks come at the cost of hours in the bank, red tape and paperwork.

It is inherently unknowable information. I guess you can try to find the average transaction size for illicit purchases and try to match that against all the bitcoin transactions happening. But you can not know why someone has made a bitcoin transaction unless you have additional information outside of the blockchain.

Also, the fact that no other resource allows you to move value this fast and reliably. If you were to do a deal today with someone across the planet how would you prefer that capital be transferred to you?

If everyone here who price goods/services in fiat currently instead priced in BTC it would have a huge impact. Instead of having to do the math and look at the exchange rate to figure out how much BTC to send it would be easier and make more sense to price directly in bitcoins. That's the end goal anyway right?

Was actually for telkom our national telecoms provider, they couldnt pay me with EFT as this would have required me to register a company and fill in tonnes more paperwork, the guy asked if they can somehow pay with creditcard then I thought.. I think paypal lets me do that.. so I tried it out. It was small consultation/design work $150. So its more of an experiment from my side aswell. They were happy enough with ease of payment atleast.

@_date: 2015-05-06 17:22:13
Far future, but putting it here while its in my head. So if an existing company has a database of products, they can code a generator that outputs a JSON formatted text file on their domain. For instance  then the app will periodically (or when asked to) pull in that data and update all the prices/locations of all starbucks on the map.
We can also provide an api with callbacks so that people can program logic into their business operations. Automatically pay people for pickup/deliveries, or build shortest distance orders for their logistics. The idea is to make it easy and painless for companies like fast food delivery to get orders and customer locations without them all to implement it from scratch.
@_date: 2015-05-06 22:18:33
Thanks for the input. This is how we get to the good stuff.
First benefit is to allow adding of information to the map easier than coinmap/osm by improving UI/UX and possibly not requiring email/signup.   
I think there is a lot of potential to unlock by going "location first" in economies, simply because when things are closer there are more efficiencies. I think these opportunities exist at the moment, but we are just unaware of the people near us.
People or automated systems (think vehicles, drones, mobile devices) can add data such as location, goods, services, wants and needs.  
Food vans, traveling performers or street merchants. Markers on the map will update through websockets (working on this now). It's about coordinating complex systems using simple mechanisms.
There will be more data because I want to encourage adding not just a retail store locations, but per item entries. For instance "burger and fries for 0.01BTC" instead of "Tom's burgers". Also I think a large part of what makes this unique is that individuals can place "request" markers. So its inverse marketing. Instead of seeing a map with only shops, you'll be able to see a map of people with problems they want to solve but don't know where to go. This should then provide a feedback loop as people see potential customers they can help. This is a theory at this point, we'll have to see. 
I'll be able to store a lot of data before even considering expiring data, it would be more of a filtering issue to keep the view from being cluttered with irrelevant data. 
Then on the keeping secondary services up to date. That's why parsing of remote .json files would be necessary, it would allow interoperability between systems much the same way as google uses robots.txt. It could make keeping things up to date automated with minimal development required.
Bitcoin is like digital cash after all and people can use whatever they prefer, I'm not trying to monetise transactions between users when they meet up in person. You are right, this is not strictly bitcoin specific, but I'd like to have prices listed in bitcoin to simplify comparing prices globally. Perhaps we can make the system smart to allow any currency and do lookups on exchanges.
@_date: 2016-03-01 11:37:48
Might be worth it to ask bitpay to add china to their list. 
Also an option to email/call the different chinese exchanges and find out if they can help.

@_date: 2015-05-19 17:10:38
I fail to see how this is different than hashing a document, and submitting some transactions to yourself with the hash included in the OP_RETURN or encoded in the transaction amounts.
@_date: 2016-01-21 07:52:30
I think the incentive to run a node is already there. It gives you the benefit of not relying on an external source for transaction/confirmation data. 
It's a matter of having broader access to fast cheap internet. This is the only reason why I'm not running a full node. I did run one about a year ago for a while though.
Also making the process more user friendly would help. When newbies download core and have no idea why nothing is happening it's like a wall of information they need to absorb before it makes sense why. Atleast the UX/UI thing is getting better with the web wallet services, but it brings in the element of third party risk.
Things are improving and moving forward, sometimes slowly sometimes real fast.

1GW is just 32km square of raw sunlight power at peak efficiency. To power a planetary number system thats not too bad.
Of course we're getting more than just the blockchain, we're incentivizing chip manufacturers to invent more efficient processing capability which would most likely help in other ways than the financial system. We're also saving on many inefficiencies that can be removed once the blockchain is more widely used.

@_date: 2015-05-02 10:16:27
Finding buyers for BTC is not difficult right now, hence the high price. There are more buyers than sellers and that is driving up the local price.
 
We have a decent exchange based in Cape Town, South Africa run by BitX (  ). ZAR transfers between the exchange and the banks are smooth and reliable. I believe the demand has drastically increased over the past few months as more people are starting to use the local exchange to buy bitcoin to then spend online, which sends bitcoin out of the local economy and creating a local vacuum in BTC.

Technically it would make confirmations faster, but reduce the security of each. Still, I would argue 4 confirmations of 2 minute blocks are better than 0 confirmations of 10 minute blocks.

I think we can all agree that the marketcap is a good way to measure the usefulness of bitcoin. If bitcoin loses usefulness then people sell, if it gains usefulness people buy.
So... just like a capitalist company we should ask what do buyers want? 
We've come this far, now its about staying relevant. I'd be fine with bitcoin handling less transactions in exchange for higher reliability, the question is how much more reliable is bitcoin than say ethereum or any other competitor? The hashing power is a good selling point, but is it really better than the faster alternatives?

I was there too. Yes there was an element of this, but I think you are a bit too critical. It was great to atleast have a bitcoin conference in africa and to get a feel for the different types of people that attended.
I doubt I'll attend this year though, their ticket price does not justify sitting infront of some marketing pitches. I guess that only reflects the state of the bitcoin nation at the moment. The people are pitching to investors and clients.. it is about money after all.
I'm also surprised to see this year has an even stronger tinge of state regulation with Chief of the Organized Crime Strike Force for the San Francisco U.S. Attorney’s Office speaking..

@_date: 2016-01-04 21:07:01
I have a theory on this. I think buying bitcoin is like lending a tiny amount of value to the bitcoin economy. So it pushes up the value of bitcoin for everyone else by a tiny tiny amount, but it does have an effect. When thousands of people buy and hold bitcoin all added together it has a huge effect on those using bitcoin to trade. Those with bitcoin then need a smaller amount of bitcoin to buy their coffee the next day, or a vendor that earned some bitcoins get more fiat than they otherwise would've so they experience a discount when resupplying their shop. This is actually investing in the real productive economy in a distributed way. I wonder if the bank using your savings can have such an impact?

@_date: 2016-03-01 05:57:05
I think bitcoin can scale to handle all transactions. 
Lets imagine for a second we get 1000tx per second and the blockchain is 100TB. So this is obviously too much to run fully on a single node, but it is possible on a distributed network.
So if the blockchain could sit on something like IPFS, SIA, MAID, STORJ or even a combination of them then a single node only needs access to the rest of the network to have access to the full blockchain of any size. 
Verification of transactions can also be split across multiple nodes, so for instance as a transaction happens there is a random one in 100 chance that it gets assigned to a node. Essentially creating 100 forks, with all valid transactions. All those 100 blocks get combined into a new hash and saved to the master blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 10:24:44
If it does not affect security then it should just be called an optimization.

I think you have grounds. A bank entry that shows money is there should be enough to conduct business.. if everyone had to wait a week per transaction before doing anything nothing would get done.
Perhaps in future withdraw the money in cash, or flip it into fresh bitcoin first. Too high risk keeping it on the bank database.

Agreed. And we already have laws against said crimes.
Most likely the money being transferred with bitcoin was earned cleanly from the perspective of the citizen. Now how that money came to exist in the first place to pay the citizen is another question, and one that I think is closer to the core of the issue here.

There is a difference. If any bank uses blockchain, they can get rid of entire departments. Thereby saving costs.
Others start to do the same and soon you have competition to provide liquidity in the bitcoin markets by banks. 
The population actually have an alternative to "money under the matress" that is outside of the control of banks.
I don't have the will to correct you on every point, but even loans can be had in bitcoin now. Fiat currency is getting forced to compete with bitcoin, or else fiat just keeps devalueing.

Can you link the transaction here, or check if it has been confirmed?

Just provide them with the tx id and the email invoice.

I doubt the physical fiat system will collapse in the near term. It has too much momentum. 
I do think the electronic central banking/stock market could collapse in the short term as people run for the exits. The credibility of the system is highly doubtful after what happened in China.
Adoption would happen when the easy money stops working. Atleast theres a physical limit on how much physical currency can exist, but on electronic systems theres no such limit outside of bitcoin (and cryptocurrency as a wider movement). 
Bitcoin scalability is a combination of how much capital it can move and how finely. We have plenty of space to grow once blocksize limits break, so I'm not too concerned. Any overflow that bitcoin can't handle will naturally flow into litecoin and others.

its amazing how bitcoin's price seems like this value calibrating machine, it hits the round values on gold like a bell. There is some resistances on the fiat number levels, but nothing like gold.

Before linux there was no real opensource OS option, everything had to be rebuilt from scratch everytime someone wanted to innovate since all the OS were proprietary code owned by companies. 
Same with bitcoin, before bitcoin there was no solid open currency. You couldn't just easily interface with bank api's, or program some automated way of moving funds around without first building your own bank with branches all over the world.

Had a look at the ZARCNY exchange rate on  and then aligned the data to the same time period to the day. 
It looks to me like there is correlation?
**edit: The forex rate of CNY per ZAR climbed 9% from 25feb to 13march. 9 percent in just over 2 weeks for a national currency!.. you'll see thats when the divergence really kicked off between the charts as well.**

Oh now they wake up.. $1T is quite a bit different than a lemonade stand hey.
The problem is the markets have been so distorted through QE and capital controls that decoupling from the fed is too painful. I think the only option left for them is to go bullish on crypto, print till their ears bleed and buy every coin on offer on the crypto exchanges. Sure that is the complete opposite from what they want to do.. but do they have an option? We have ourselves a mexican standoff... the first bank to go all in either wins or sets off the race to the bottom.
Will we see global hyperinflation of fiat currencies and at the same time the crypto economy to the moon?

Things take longer than we expect, and then happen faster than we expect. In some sense this shift has been happening since bitcoin was first traded. The problem is the masses of people that will be holding the fiat bag at the end of this.. you'll tell them to buy bitcoin, they won't listen, their savings will go to shit and they'll get mad and start to break stuff. I hope I'm wrong...
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:40:11

There are alt coins that have no block size limit and more flexibility when it comes to transaction complexity. I think bitcoin is working as intended. It doesnt have to scale to meet 8billion people doing microtransactions, other tech can handle that.

Cheaper coins for me then!

Thats extreme. Bitcoin has more holders than your btchombre-coins. Your trillion dollar coin will be extremely volatile till the price stabilizes.

Yeah I get that, but at the point where a smart contract is supposed to make a payment it's possible to just swap out the destination address or the amount?

I'd hope that 1BTC buys more than a loaf of bread, so perhaps a decent car is the right answer.
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:37:43
joking right?
there is no Bitcoin CEO. No-one can just decide what the production rate should be, that was prescribed by satoshi in the original bitcoin design and code.
This is one of bitcoin core strengths. As demand increases, supply cannot be increased to match. Supply is always known and predictable.
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:57:44
If we assume that bitcoin is a pure currency, that no entity can make new bitcoin at will. 
And we can assume that a central bank will want to be able to create currency at will.
Then we can assume that bitcoin is superior at retaining purchasing power per unit. 
The only thing that would be better than bitcoin is a currency that allows faster confirmation, higher throughput, better integration, more diverse userbase, lower monetary inflation and/or lower fees.

I think it was the naming of the change.. "segregated witness" sounds a lot like a crime happening and something happening to the witness. Much care should be taken in naming of changes, I'd prefer BIP codes.
@_date: 2016-06-27 15:06:19
More specifically, as more miners or mining hardware comes online to compete for the new bitcoins it causes hash-rate to increase, then the algorithm difficulty increases as well to keep block times constant. 
So, no matter how much mining power you could magically put onto the network, there will always be a predetermined amount of bitcoin distributed across the miners. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:14:26
If you look at a 2 year view on the price you'll see the steep side areas on the bowl formation is always volatile. I think this is a combination of longs closing, and profit taking after shorts closed.

Think of it as a helicopter; at the moment the force of gravity and the force of the rotor is balanced. If this balance is altered by even 1%, over a period of time it becomes a huge difference in altitude.

I think smart contracts should stay well clear of the bitcoin blockchain. Let them experiment and learn how to do this on other chains before transplanting the technology to bitcoin.

I know this. But the average person starting to use bitcoin does not. I've had a person buy 0.1 BTC from me last week, and he managed to loose his bitcoin app inside a week with no idea what happened.
It is a real problem. The apps need to enforce people to save their HD 12 words. The Android bitcoin app does not do this.
@_date: 2016-06-16 09:50:00
Man.. if btc hits $100,000 the world would be a much better place.
@_date: 2016-06-13 08:44:01
In terms of the title "shrinking supply" it is simply less sell side pressure. We were in a state of balanced supply and demand. 
Think in terms of ratio:    BTCsupplyPerMinute/BTCdemandPerMinute
When this ratio is 1 then price is stable. We are now in an environment where the BTCsupplyPerMinute must reduce because of the algorithm halving the rate of new bitcoins created from 25BTC to 12.5BTC per 10minutes. We are also at the same time with increased BTCdemandPerMinute because of various factors such as increased bitcoin based trade, hodling, fomo, new investors etc.. This gives a quick change in ratio, thus price change.
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:04:24
The problem is your pesos are worthless. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 06:53:33
Its the halvening is in less than 4 weeks now.     
The rate of new bitcoin created per year will drop suddenly from about 9% to 4%.     
Theres also the huge amounts of money in risky investments that are providing too little benefit for the risk, so money is flowing to bitcoin as a safer alternative.
@_date: 2016-06-26 06:02:48
Go for it :)

They probably think bitcoin is a commodity with a supply rate or something. You are right tho, there is more bitcoin, just at a slower rate than usual.
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:45:20
If the amount of value purchased stays the same, yes. It must.
I did a recursive simulation quickly to see where price would be at different time scales.

Interestingly if I start off on a price of $240 (the bottom of the big dip months ago, then my algorithm stops at $650. So it really depends on how much miners are still selling into the market.

Have a look on  and wait 10minutes. Note down how many BTC was bought, now compare that to the 25BTC that was made in that same time. Consider the implications of a 12.5BTC per 10minute difference in supply. It's on the order of 1 to 2% per block.

There are a few things they need to understand.
1) To compete with bitcoin they need to have a similar inflation rate or less.    
2) They could just use bitcoin to store hashes of their database to pickup tampering. That solves most of the problem.    
3) Just use bitcoin and contribute code to help scaling.
@_date: 2016-06-14 05:40:09

@_date: 2016-06-16 12:31:49
They can't keep bitcoin from being used for trade. And if we assume that bitcoin is superior than any alternative currency, then any traders that utilize bitcoin will outcompete any other players in the market. Thus eventually forcing them to use bitcoin, or go extinct in the long term.

if btc goes from buying a pizza to a graphics card in one day, someone will offer to sell you a pizza for the price of a paperclip because tomorrow it pays for 2 pizzas.

Ignoring speculation, we can predict that the price would increase atleast 1.00% at block 420000, then in the next 10 minutes people would need 0.99BTC instead of 1.00BTC to have the same amount of value. So the effect of reduced supply has a 1% reduced effect on price. It's almost a compound interest effect but in reverse. And I'm making the assumption of constant value purchased. 
So by block 420100 the effect should be reduced from 1% to 0.01%, but cumulatively we'd have seen a 50% rise in price over 100 blocks (17 hours) just to satisfy the same supply/demand balance.
after 10 minutes up 1% price rise    
after 20 minutes up another 0.99% (cumulative 1.99%)    
after 30 minutes up another 0.98% (cumulative 2.97%)     
and so on..  
after 17hours up another 0.01% (cumulative 50.5%)

Making any trade has various factors to consider, and many are unique to each individual's income, knowledge, idea of the future and current reality. 
If more people are sure the price will go up in near future then price goes up.
If more people are sure the price will go down in near future then price goes down.
There are also hard limits to what is possible, some people need to sell no matter what because of unexpected bills. Or others have sudden good business and decide to buy bitcoin to diversify savings.
@_date: 2016-12-17 14:28:54
Because banks can print more cash without doing work and spend it thereby devaluing the cash people already had (because it is less scarce). 
It is a way of invisible theft.
Some currencies have less of this happening than others. In some countries is got reallly bad like venezuela right now.
Bitcoin is a type of money where noone can "just print more" it is very difficult to fake or obtain without actually doing work. This makes bitcoin a somewhat more predictable money because we know how much of it exists and have a degree of trust that it wont suddenly become hyperinflated.

Sellers should always be greedy, that is natural. Ofcourse you want to sell for the highest price. I think a  better way to explain this is over supply of NGN. And the gov trying to keep the NGN high in value artificially by trying to rig the exchange rate to USD.

transactions are collected and hashed into a block by the miners, to find the matching block to the transactions that are valid takes processing power, this is what makes bitcoin scarce and difficult to forge. These blocks are found on average every 10 minutes. So there has been 400000 of these blocks now chained together and represents the full history of transactions. This is open and available to all to accesss, and you can record transactions if you send bitcoin.

People naturally want to protect their money. That means on average people will sell their bitcoin at a profit. This creates a balance of buy and sell pressure. Ofcourse the counter force to this is asset performance. If another asset is growing faster than bitcoin people are more likely to sell btc in order to hold a faster growth asset.. At potentially higher risk or volatility.

Yes its a concern, but the people who "invest" in a middleman to hold bitcoin for them should understand the risks. Also, the market will sort this out on its own. 
If people give x amount of money to a fund to hold bitcoin on their behalf, and a fork happens, and the fund chooses to go the route of the shitcoin. Then before long trades out of the fund will bankrupt it if it tried to maintain the high value fictitiously. 
Thats the beauty of bitcoin, you can only fake it for a little while before math catches up.

Because then they lose power faster.    
Print money = currency loses value, increases capital flight out of country.   
Buy bitcoin = bitcoin rises faster, increases capital flight out of fiat.
I do think its only a matter of time, and as some nations/large corporations start moving into crypto, it will place economic pressure on others to do so as well.

@_date: 2015-04-30 07:37:12
I agree with your concerns. They are valid.
The problems you describe are opportunities for improvement. The cost of producing electricity is falling. Digital communications are almost universal now. Devices that can handle bitcoin are becoming cheaper. In South Africa you can buy a smart phone for around $50 and this is getting cheaper.
I see bitcoin replacing the bank database systems, with a freefloating fiat&lt;&gt;bitcoin ATM system world wide. So you can have no device at all, but still use bitcoin using any computer.
The only threat to bitcoin at the moment is collapse of the communications network, and at this point it is a very glaring weak point. As we improve communications by decentralisation we'll reduce costs and increase the reliability and accessibility of the bitcoin network.

send people to every busy airport, help them offer btc fiat conversions for travellers. Minimal startup costs. 
Next is to get the guys who run the existing ATM system to update so people can convert fiat btc like that.
Next is to undercut existing shipping costs for goods. Think automated shipping and delivery worldwide, with drone depos. And mobile ordering, short delivery times times.

For every sell there is a buy. So are you going to buy all the bitcoin and give cash? I'm sure you would have to use the exchanges to be able to do this. I doubt its going to be possible to provide a better rate than exchanges, especially with the overhead of dealing with cash.

Offchain transactions rely on putting bitcoin onto a shared system where ownership of the bitcoin is then controlled by that system. Bitcoin offchain transactions are essentially just swapping control of bitcoin without transmitting transactions onto the bitcoin blockchain until there is settlement or some withdrawal from the system. The problem is if the system is not fair, ius compromised or loses the bitcoin of the users in some way.

Bitcoin and the FED essentially serve the same purpose, to keep track of funds at the global banking level. The difference is that bitcoin is automated, secure, global and without political interference. The FED on the otherhand is a system run by humans. Basicly its too nice and tempting to create money out of thin air to bailout friends, the problem is that causes the rest of the holders of currency to lose purchasing power because the currency is no longer as scarce as it was. But the new funds are in the hands of the elite.. which is an unfair system. Bitcoin aims to fix that by making it impossible for anyone to get easy coins, it makes it a level playing field.

@_date: 2017-07-13 06:09:01
To answer this we have to discuss how money works. The simplest explanation I have is that when you trade labour for something you want that thing to be as scarce as possible. In other words the "money" or "store of value" should not be easily produced or faked by someone else in the world, which would essentially just make you work your ass off for something that they can easily just make out of thin air. When we look at a currency like USD it is basically just computer databases that can be edited by those in control, or printed by criminals/those in control. In both those cases you are losing out because your money you hold is getting watered down in value, because its not as scarce as it was when you earned it. 
Now, when you look at bitcoin as an alternative you must understand how it makes this new kind of money that is more scarce, more difficult to fake/produce and not as easily watered down. Essentially it makes it more reliable as a store of value so that you can trade your past labor for future labor from someone else. 
Another way to look at it is because bitcoin has a limited amount, and more people could move to using it it means theres less bitcoin available per person on average. That means demand for it increases while supply stays the same, that means the amount of purchasing power must increase. 
Yet another way to look at it is like a record keeping system for crowd lending. If you buy bitcoin, your dollar goes to someone else who used to have bitcoin but wanted or had to sell for some reason. That must be quite a good reason otherwise they wouldnt sell. That means they must have something that they want to have happen in the world that is worthwhile to happen, it could be because they want to buy something they need (which could make them more productive, or have a better life, like a bicycle or car, or a home and so on), that money then goes to someone who produced something that was worthwhile to do. That person then most likely uses that money to buy supplies to make more of whatever they make that is useful. Essentially your dollar moves around in the economy probably doing good, good that otherwise would have not been possible without your dollar. Doing better than it would have if you held it in your pocket, or put it in the bank where the banker used it to buy some snort or wheels for his ferrari. So in comparison it probably produces more good in the world because bitcoin is scarce and people want it, so when people sell bitcoin it is more likely to go to a good purpose. In the long run this value produced in the world reflects back on the purchasing price of bitcoin because of market dynamics.. thus when you want to sell bitcoin you'll probably be able to buy more dollars then you put in at the start. 
just note that currency market are complex, it could be that something even better comes along. The FED might stop printing money, and burn all the paper money they can get their hands on, so that might make the dollar more scarce again.. anything is possible.

Every sell is matched with someone who is offering to buy at that price. This is also called liquidity in the market (the ability to find a willing buying/seller).
If one exchange suddenly gets dumped on then buyers move in to get the cheap bitcoins to sell on other exchanges, thus effectively helping to stabilize the market faster.

The solution would be to rename these broke banks currency to something new. So instead of getting nothing you atleast get some tokens. These tokens can then find an exchange rate to the other currencies. All a broke bank still has is the numbers in the database and the idea that those should have value.

Closest to the "reverse" is to see bitcoin transactions happening. 
or 
Every blip on fiat leak is someone buying fiat with their bitcoin, and someone buying bitcoin with their fiat.  So there is no "reverse"

FTSE is measured in pounds. And pounds lost value to everything else. So yes FTSE numbers are higher, but the actual purchasing power fell.
