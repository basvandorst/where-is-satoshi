My front page piece on CityAM/CryptoAM (over 1 mln readers/mo) on why QE (quantitative easing) will fail: [
TLDR:  
We are in the late stages of the long term debt cycle which typically runs roughly for 70-80 years.
1) The power of central banks to stimulate economies has eroded considerably because interest rates can only go so low. Countries such as Germany, Japan, and Switzerland are in negative rate territory.
2) Buying assets with printed money eventually fails to produce any real productivity as the capital stays in the hands of investors rather than benefit the economy. Real profits are thus diminished. Meanwhile...
3) Debt keeps piling up. Without adequate profits and tax revenues, governments may default on their debt obligations such as with the massive healthcare and pension platforms.
The recent spate of global crises spurred by economic and political tensions only adds volatility and uncertainty to where the world sits. Thus as major tipping points concerning interest rates, debt, and econopolitical tensions are hit, precious metals are the beneficiaries not to mention bitcoin and various hard assets. This further exacerbates populist tensions between the haves and have-nots as the wealth gap is widened.

Good points,  Bill Gates and his team have created nuclear reactor tech that utilizes all the uranium waste generated by old school reactors. They were to do a deal with China until the trade war started. The Chinese are hugely pro-nuclear reactors so a deal may still be struck but maybe not sooner than later. That said, other countries should onboard this tech.
