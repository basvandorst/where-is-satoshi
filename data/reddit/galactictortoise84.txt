So, in that scenario, they would take my money to pay out people who took the risk of leaving BTC in an exchange...?

That's what I thought, until i read this;

There is a huge difference.
BTC is easy to steal.
Fiat is not easy to steal.
Also, I did not 'leave it there'. My deposit had just gone through.
Also, according to someone else in this thread;


Why is it fair for them to take my USD, but not other peoples cryptos?

So they will liquidate all the remaining BTC and ETH? 
That would result in a massive dump.

I'm not in USA, so I'm not sure that guarantee applies to me?
EDIT: 


The question is.... is Bitfinex an FDIC insured bank?
EDIT 2: 


Looks like i might be okay...

Don't have ANYTHING in exchanges.
I was under the impression that holding USD in an exchange was safe.
It's now looking like I lost my $30,000 USD.

Ugh... well there goes my day.

She was asking for it! She shouldn't have worn a short skirt!

That seems bizarre? What does USD have to do with BTC being stolen?
