The US has welfare, which is gratuitously used by blacks.




Sounds like this is related to the parents then? Btw how come this doesn't apply to east Asians and poor whites (there are twice as many poor whites as poor blacks in the US)?
How come a white kid whose family makes 20,000$ a year has the same SAT score than black kids whose familiy makes ten times more?

That's a non-sequiter as tenement slums in general are very rare. Can you show me Asian and Jewish slums?


That's not true and very racist to say. White people are systematically discriminated against in university/college enrollment and job placement through affirmative action. This ESPECIALLY hurts poor whites. Whites are actually charged with hate crimes while other minorities hardly are and that's the way Eric Holder said he wants it: 
The racist stereotyping of white people as racist (which is untrue compared to blacks and other minotiries) hurts the performance of whites and causes emotional issues:
Blacks are considered the most racist by every racist, **including blacks themselves**:
You'll probably bring up a disproportionate amount of blacks getting arrested and also bring up the connected drug use/arrest rate racism myth so I'll in advance link research and studies by major organisations disproving this:  


How come welfare fraud is so rampant? Again and again I see stories on reddit where redditors agree that welfare fraud is rampant. Apparently among 15-20% of all welfare users have been caught committing welfare fraud. (This means the actual abuse rate is higher)
The US even has section 8 housing where the government gives you housing (!). Can you show me stats about the amount of people dying of starvation on welfare or living on street?

That's the parents. This is the third time you sketched an (accurate) situation where it's the parents.


Not true, it's indeed true there are more minorities living in cities but it isn't that super disproportional considering twice the amount of whites are poor (and we never hear anything about these poor whites).
Rural poverty is a lot more persistent than urban poverty too.




What does this have to do with racism? Is there any structural difference between black cities like Detroit and others?


The richest 1% in the US pay 50% of all taxes, do you think that's fair? If I were making $10+ million a year it would also tick me off  that I have to subsidize people who don't want to work. In the US and most Western countries healthy bodied adults can live off the welfare system without having worked a day of their life.

There are many reasons for this and the report you linked is fringe and includes common myths. For example it doesn't mention the fact that self-reported drug use by blacks is a lot lower than actual drug use. This is important as the 'drug use per race' facts come from studies which don't actually measure drug use but ask a sample population about their **self-reported** drug use.
Blacks commit about 70-80% of all robberies in the US and 52% of all homicide while only being about 13% of the population. Just to show how bad it is:




The disproportionate drug arrests simple come from the fact that most drug arrests are a by-product of being **seriously** suspected of another crime. The chance of getting arrested for doing drugs while not committing other crimes is very low in the US and Western countries (unless you're Snoop Dogg). If you hear police officer testimonials (including black cops, which funny enough never get brought up) they'll tell you blacks are more overt with gang/drug/thug behavior/use.
On the subject of the racial disparity in drug arrests, despite similar rates of use:
































That's a fringe study and you know it. Can you give me some of the example of racial bias which would affect a black kid whose parents who make $200,000 a year and which doesn't affect white/asian/Jewish kids whose parents only make $20,000 a year?
How come this racial bias doesn't affect Asians?
And another thing, the SAT tests skills which are required for college/universities. Any racial bias reflects a similar racial bias in college and in their later jobs, as the skills are needed in those places too. Do you deny this? The ridiculously high dropout rate by black students: 
There's also the major issue of grade inflation in (majority) black schools, as anyone who has taught at black schools will tell you.
Here's an article from the left wing Huffington Post about the lack of racial bias in the SATs:
