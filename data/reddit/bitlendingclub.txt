As [Its_free_and_fun]( stated: BTC and USD-denominated loans are an option which allows borrowers and lenders to hedge their risk. In general, the market is efficient enough to account for the risk involved and to discount it accordingly.

This is a tough question. How short should they actually be? 60% of the loans on our platform are between 7 and 30 days, the next 30% are between 1 and 3 months. I wouldn't be able to give a better risk evaluation than what the market dictates and it seems that the market is comfortable with the current loan lengths.


Sorry for the confusion: I'm suggesting that the short term loans leads to shorter exposure to volatility risk, not to less volatility risk.  


That's the general argument against Bitcoin itself: people are just too greedy and they want to make easy money. However, I don't believe that's the case! None of the investors on our platform are out there to lose money and they take the appropriate steps to minimize their risk. We try to help them do that as well.  


The [FDIC characterizes predatory lending]( as deceptive loan terms, charging higher fees than what the borrower qualifies for, stripping the borrower of equity, or placing the borrower in a lower credit rating to benefit the lenders, etc. Subsequently, the guidance issued to borrowers is that they should seek quotes from multiple lenders. Our platform is quite the opposite of predatory, it delivers the most fair lending the market can offer:   
* The terms of the loan are extremely clear and they cannot be abused by the lenders, borrowers or us.  
* A large number of lenders submit offers for each loan; most get between 10-30 offers, but some get over 100.  
* The borrower can always reject individual offers or the entire loan.    
* The borrower is not required to post equity as collateral.  
With regards to the average interest rate being 365% APR, that's only indicative of the types of loans people are able to fund. The reason such loans cannot be funded in the standard banking sector is not because they're so crazy, but because the banks don't find it profitable to analyze the risk associated with them. A bank would have to spend well over $1.5 million USD to educate its employees on what Bitcoin is and how to price the risk of Bitcoin loans. If the current amount of Bitcon loans people are seeking is only $1.5 million, then it would make very little financial sense for a bank to start funding those loans. Our lenders already understand how to asses the risk with Bitcoin related loans, so they're willing to fund them.  


We have both USD and Bitcon denominated loans, so lenders and borrowers can take either side of the market, if all they're doing is speculating. So it doesn't matter which way Bitcoin happens to be going, the borrowers/lenders can hedge in both directions. Furthermore, your analysis seems to have a lot of assumptions which are conflict what we're actually observing: 60% of the loans are less than 30 days, another 30% are between 1 month and 3 months. We have no evidence to suggest that the borrowers are systematically misrepresenting their loans with the intend of simply speculating on the price. Of course, people can openly state that they're going to speculate on the Bitcoin price, but the market participants are then simply taking positions against each-other.  


A number of people expressed interest in funding BLC operations (from dev to marketing) as part of the discussion in the Bitcoin Investment Group. There were many ideas discussed and the conclusion was that the we should do a marketing donation drive. The discussion took place in the private Facebook group for BIG, which is largely comprised of the lenders on our platform. It seems reasonable, to our customers and us, that we should be doing what our customers have requested... but perhaps I'm not understanding your criticism.

There are several major reasons why P2P lending has a future:
- We have loans denominated in USD and BTC, so the borrowers/lenders can hedge their position according to where they think the price will head to.   
- The market adjusts for risk: most of the loans are fairly short term at this stage, i.e. less than 3 months. Shorter loan terms tend to result in less volatility risk.   
- The demand for a lending platform is quite big. We have around 1000 investors who have invested over 3500 BTC within the last 6 months. More recently we're seeing over $500K worth of loans being funded per month, which is a good indicator that the marker does have a need for a P2P lending platform.  
- Market volatility will decrease as liquidity increases.  
Our platform allows people in the Bitcoin ecosystem to secure loans for many types of Bitcoin-related ventures. For example: if you want to fund some aspect of your startup business, you can either look for VC funding or you can get a loan. VC funding will cost you equity, whereas a loan will only cost you the interest. Of course, there are benefits to VC funding which might be worth the cost of equity and vice versa.

[BitLendingClub offers a crowd-funded loan]( which will be used by one of the trusted members of the [Bitcoin Investment Group]( to compete in the auction. The goal is to collect 3386 BTC, withdraw $200K deposit via BitStamp into a US account owned by the LLC of Gerald Wilkie, the member in question. He'll then used the $200K to make a deposit and compete for as many of the 3K BTC blocks as possible (up to $2 million USD). The rest of the funds will require multi-signature approval, of several other highly trusted members of the Bitcoin Investment group, in order to withdraw for the final stage, which is purchasing the BTC. BitLendingClub will then modify the interest rate of each loan in order to match the profit from the auction, then the BTC gets sent to borrower who will hit the repay button. Please visit the [loan listing]( and join the [Bitcoin Investment Group]( for more information.

The investors have been quite active in weeding out scams and exposing fraud. When we first started the website we weren't sure how it's going to turn out, but for the past 6 months we've been working closely with the investors. Our experience with them is that they are very proactive when it comes to protecting their investment and minimizing the risk of defaults.  


The opportunity to steal always exists, but proper due diligence reduces the risk quite drastically. The default rate on the website is about 4%, which is pretty much the same default rate as the fiat P2P lending sites (their default rates are close to 5%). So I can't speak about what could or couldn't happen, I can only tell you what is happening.  As I said, if we look at it from that perspective, Bitcoin shouldn't be happening either. Therefore we should consider the fact that efficient markets really do exists. If a product is good, then it will survive on the market... otherwise it will die off. The lenders, our investors and we are under the impression that our product is good and it will survive on the market.   


I'm assuming that there will be defaults on certain loans, but that's a risk which both lenders and borrowers are willing to take. Subsequently, the lenders are charging a premium on the given risk and that causes the interest rates to be 365% APR.  


That's hard to ignore, given that a fundamental part of the market is having the ability to hedge risk. USD loans provide the ability to hedge risk, so I'm pretty hesitant to ignore that. I would expect a default rate not much different from the current one, simply because my view is that this is an efficient market and the volatility is already priced into the interest rates. In other words, people who wouldn't be able to afford a $350 to $1,000 jump in price wouldn't be able to handle a 350% APR either. Subsequently, the funds are currently being used for ventures which allow the borrowers to cover the given interest rate and the risk associated with a possible price jump. As the liquidity increases, we're expecting to see a decrease in market volatility. This will allow more risk-averse participants to join the lending platform.  


I hope we're able to come to a consensus here (not just because the FDIC has issued guidance): interest rate is not what determines if there is predatory lending or not. There are a number of factors which characterize predatory lending and they generally involve unfair, misleading or plain old abusive loan terms. Our platform not only provides the most fair loan terms and the most competitive interest rates that the market can offer, but nobody gets their house repossessed or knee-caps broken if they default. Despite that, there are real repercussions: if a borrower defaults, they may never be able to get another loan on BLC again.  


Reputation loans have evolved over time. At this moment they have the following structure: each borrower is allowed only one reputation loan ever, the funds cannot be withdrawn, re-invested or used to pay off other loans. Their main purpose is to give the borrower an opportunity to demonstrate that they cover some minimum requirements with a substantially lower interest rate (lenders ask for as little as 1% interest on these loans):  
* They understand how the platform works.  
* Lenders can communicate with them.  
* The borrower can acquire BTC outside of the platform in order to pay the interest.  
About 20% of the loans on our system are from people in developing countries (Indonesia, India, Kenya, etc). There may be some cultural and language barriers which may prevent a borrower from successfully using our platform. Reputation loans are quite useful in filtering out people that might otherwise be good borrowers, but they don't fully understand how Bitcoin works or how our platform works (for the previously mentioned reasons).  


The lenders understand that a marketing campaign benefits them as much as it benefits us. Both lenders and our platform only make money from the loan repayments. This makes our relationship with lenders quite unique: our interests are heavily aligned. So any increase in the number of qualified borrowers is going to be a positive net result for the lenders and BitLendingClub alike. We've had a historically close relationship with the lenders and we work closely with each-other in order to succeed. This is also the reason why we decided to synergize in the marketing efforts as well. They have been ~~pressuring~~ asking us to provide them with ways to financially contribute to BLC and this was something that we agreed on as a community.

Yah, it seems like he's ran away with the money. Unfortunately, we don't make enough money to do collections yet. However, we are spending all of our resources on helping prevent such cases. We've created a new credit scoring model, which is vastly improved over our previous one. We hope that this will help our lenders mitigate the risk and they will also diversify. Please feel free to take a look at our statistics on the credit ratings, interest rates and default rates: 
@_date: 2015-05-21 03:35:15
One of the things we've been considering is adjusting the [credit limits]( based on the [PPP index]( of each country. For example, if we have a borrower who has not provided us with any income, we give them a maximum credit limit of $300. However, $300 in Indonesia (PPP index at 3,802.42) goes a lot further than $300 in Brazil (1.61), so scammers in Indonesia have a lot higher incentive to come in, get verified without providing any proof of income and walk away with $300. Adjusting the credit limits by PPP index should make it a lot less worthwhile for a borrower in a country with a high PPP index to default on a loan.

The partnership between **GenesisMining** and **BitLendingClub** is the first step in providing smart loans using the block-chain technology, it's a a monumental step in the history of cryptocurrencies! This partnership is the very first of its kind in the world of Crypto. Cloud mining + peer-to-peer Bitcoin lending is the best of both worlds, and opens up a whole new array of possibilities for all parties involved. By combining forces, BitLendingClub and Genesis Mining have managed to create a brand new type of loan which nearly eliminates the risk of default due to borrower error. We're hoping that our partnership will eventually allow us to integrate smart loans into the block-chain in a way that has never been done before!
**How it works:**
 The platform allows borrowers from all over the world to request a hosted mining loan. When lenders fund the loan, BitLendingClub creates a special account with Genesis Mining for the specific borrower. BitLendingClub sets the Genesis Mining payout address to the borrower's account at BitLendingClub. Automatic payments from the borrower's balance to the lenders are enabled and the borrower is not allowed to disable the automatic payments. Genesis Mining pays out in BTC to the specific payout address until the end of the contract. When the loan is repaid, BitLendingClub allows the borrower to invest and withdraw funds from his account and gives the borrower the credentials for his account at Genesis Mining.
**Genesis Mining guarantees the following:**  
* Hosting of the mining equipment. *100% up-time for the mining equipment.  
* Regular payouts for the length of the mining contract.   
* Payouts to an address controlled by BitLendingClub. 
Genesis Mining is not responsible for any losses which may occur due to increased mining difficulty, fluctuation of exchange rates, or any other factor which may affect the ability of the mining equipment to make payouts. The Terms and Conditions of Genesis Mining apply to the relationship between the customer and Genesis Mining under each relevant contract. If the mining equipment can no longer mine profitably and the loan is still not paid off, then the borrower is still responsible for any remaining balance.
Please note that when you choose "Hosted mining" loan type, you won't be able to use your account to withdraw BTC, invest or create new loans until the loan is repaid.
Listening to your feedback, we have taken various steps to improve our services. Here are some of the things you have helped change within BitLendingClub:  
* New loan type for Hosted Mining with the cooperation of Genesis Mining.  
* New loan type for reputation loans. We have placed withdrawal restrictions on reputation loans. If a loan is strictly for reputation, then funds from it can't be withdrawn. *Automatically processed withdrawals for users who have a reputation above 100. Users will be allowed to do an automatic withdrawal if they have no open listings. *Automatically rejected withdrawals for reputation loans. E-mail notification will be sent to the investors if the user attempts to withdraw fund from reputation loan.  
* We’ve also enhanced the Investment section in the Dashboard. You are now able to see your total invested amount, earned interest in BTC and total amount of repaid investments in BTC. In addition to these statistics, you are also able to see the default rate on your investments.  
BitLendingClub is always open for innovative ideas. If you have any ideas that you would like to share about how to improve our lending platform, we are always here to help out. Do not hesitate to contact support with any questions or concerns: support You can also user our Help Center to ask questions and get support from the BitLendingClub community: Thank you for being part of the BitLendingclub community — we hope you enjoy it!

Thank you for the comment. This issue has been heavily discussed in our forums by our community: 
The change in terms is specifically targeting borrowers who have laddered loans (i.e. taking out one loan to repay another). We have changed our terms so loan laddering is no longer possible. It's also important to note the context of the policy change and the impact it had on the borrowers. There were a total of about 6 borrowers who have been affected by this change, out of over 1600. These borrowers were going to default, because they had stacked loans and they didn't have to means to repay them. We simply stopped allowing borrowers to take out multiple loans, but their existing loans remained and they should have repaid them as part of their agreement to the original terms of the loans.
TLDR: Our change had no actual impact on the borrower's ability to repay loans, unless they were expecting to take out another loan in order to repay a previous one.

I'm responding to the points that were in the article, not to your comment necessarily:  


The privacy comes from the private key, not from the newly minted coins tho.  


It's just a Raspberry Pi with a mining chip and a customized OS on it. I get that this prototype is probably like the Tesla Roadster and the next product will be like the Model S, but all they're really providing is a new OS. The mining chip is completely useless!


Again, not sure why you need custom hardware for that. The existing hardware should be capable of providing that solution, like the [ARM TrustZone](
@_date: 2015-09-23 04:14:56
So it's like the Tesla Roadster and in car terms, going for the (bigger) mainstream Model S is like taking this prototype and going for the (smaller) mainstream IoT-capable chip.

It's not out of the question down the line. However, I don't think in the future it will be feasible for borrowers to stack loans between platforms, because loans will be much longer term. If your loan is a year and you have to make a payment every month, then it would make very little sense to take out a loan on another platform in order to repay the current one. Not that it wouldn't happen, but the borrower would have to stack by immediately repaying one loan, which looks suspicious for a 1 year term.

Seemed like a pretty clear answer: Tesla had an IPO and was valued at billions of dollars before they decided to open source their patents. Coinbase is orders of magnitude smaller than Tesla and they don't quite enjoy the same position of power (money), which would allow them the flexibility to open source their patents.

I'm the CEO of BitLendingClub and I'm here to tell you a bit more about P2P lending. Mooncake's experience is not far from what we've seen on the platform, but I'd like to provide a bit of context.  First and foremost: trying to "mimic" BTCJam's auto-invest on our platform will not work, they do a lot more than just to put your money in highly rated loans. We'll get into the details in a bit, but here is the big picture:
**Default Rates vs ROI**  
Having a high default rate does not necessarily mean that the lenders are losing money. Stu Lutsman is one of the experienced lenders and he's [posted an ROI of 2.53% for August]( and the average default rate for the month is 9.65%. In addition, I would like to compare the performance with the first years of LendingClub and Propsper:
1. Propser experienced 26% default rates in the first 2 years, which lead to about -4.67% ROI:   
2. LendingClub experienced 14.8% default rates in the first year, with -3.44% ROI:   
How do P2P platforms turn high default rates into profit, or not such a horrible loss? The answer is risk-based pricing and solid underwriting procedures. When we first started BitLendingClub, we had the optimistic idea that the free market is the best. Many people in the Bitcoin community, as well as our own community, also believe that we should let the free market decide as much as possible. Over time, the "smart" lenders will be profitable, the "not-so-smart" lenders will lose some cash, the good borrowers will be rewarded, the bad borrowers will be publicly shamed and everybody will be happy. Unfortunately, that's not how it works, just ask Chris Larsen from Prosper: 
**The Free Market**  
The truth is that if we want to have a truly free-market platform, then **all** of the information necessary to judge the risk with the loan should be available to the lenders. However, much of the information actually necessary to calculate the risk is extremely private. So we, as a platform, have had to play the arbiter and determine which information should be private, which should be public and how to manage it. But suppose that we do have the perfect balance, the lenders are still going to be left with an overwhelming amount of information. We have over 1600 borrowers, each one having more than 40 properties and more than 8,000 loans. That's a matrix of more than 51 million data points! The average lender simply doesn't have the time or the means to analyze that much data.  
**Bitcoin Volatility**  
The best way to avoid the Bitcoin volatility is to use the block-chain as a "value transport layer", which means denominating the loans in fiat, keeping the lender's funds in fiat and only converting to Bitcoin when a transfer is necessary. That's not a very popular thing in the Bitcoin space, but read the next section why this method of lending is going to be a huge positive for Bitcoin.
**If it's so bad, then why do you still run your platform?**  
Our platform was seeing default rates in excess of 16%, sometimes as high as 30%, before March. Since then, we've made some major strides in improving our screening procedures ([recently busted over 100 borrowers from an MLM scheme]( that spanned Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and Mexico) and we've brought it down to about 8% on average. With those rates, we're seeing an average ROI of about -2%, which is slightly better than the early days of Propser and LendingClub. In addition, we're working on further improving the credit scoring, risk-based pricing, and we're currently testing auto-invest (which has had extremely promising results). As I mentioned in the previous paragraph: Bitcoin as a value transport layer means that we can fund mainstream loans. This, in term means that if we were to have the necessary market penetration within the developing countries, Bitcoin based P2P lenders would have funded $5 billion in loans this year alone, which would have generated over $20 billion in liquidity on the market. That's without factoring the exponential growth of marketplace lending! **I believe that this is one of the killer apps for Bitcoin and I think we can make it work!**
@_date: 2015-09-24 14:26:43
In the free market, the average investor under-performs the market by about 1.5% [1]. The average default rate on our platform is about 8% and since we run the platform on a free-market model, this means that the average lender under-performs the market by about 1.5% too.  If you look at the lender's ROI, they do indeed average about 2% loss. This is entirely consistent with the way the free market works and this statistic didn't change when we cut the default rate in half, from about 16% to 8% [2]. We implemented filters on our platform that brought down the default rate by more than 50% in March[3] (and it's remained at about 8% since theN), but surprisingly, the loss to lenders remained at 2%. This was also true with Prosper when they first started: things were so bad that they posted 26.1% defaults and the ROI was about -4.64% [4] in their first 2 years. LendingClub posted 14.81% defaults and -3.44% ROI in their first year [5].


So what was Prosper's solution?  
1. Stop the dutch-auction.  
2. Take ownership of the lending decisions: i.e. they did their own underwriting on the loans, instead of letting the individual lenders do it.  
My point is that there will always be scammers. You can blame us for not cutting enough scammers out of the platform, but regardless if the default rate is 8% or 26%, the lenders will continue to make the same fundamental mistake: they under-price the loans in a free-market model. So the real solution is to do what LendingClub and Prosper did, and to my dislike... what BTCJam is doing also: risk-based pricing and auto-invest. Luckily BTCJam is still not very good at it, so that gives us a chance to catch up to them and pass them pretty quickly.

A competing business would be quite obvious and it would work for a handful of businesses only (i.e. those that accept 0 conf transactions). How many businesses **actually** need to accept 0 conf transactions?
For merchants that ship their product: it takes **significantly** longer than 10 minutes to ship a package. If you're a brick and mortar store, sure you might need to do that, but then your competition would have to walk to your store and initiate so many double-spend transactions that they run you out of business... not exactly feasible. Or just imagine the comical picture of your competitor coming in and having to carry out **all** of your merchandise and trying to walk away with it before the double-spend is detected. Or if you're a restaurant, then the competition would have to sit down and eat all of your food! It gets quite absurd quite fast.
I'm sitting here and I'm trying really hard to think of a business that is not a physical entity (restaurant, convenience store, gas station, etc.) and would actually need a 0-conf transaction. I really can't think of one. The majority of merchants go through a payment processor, which can provide the visual indicator to the customer and the payment confirmation to the merchant. If the payment processor detects a double-spend, then they notify the merchant that the transaction didn't go through. If they don't go through a payment processor, then whatever client they're using to receive BTC would show them the double-spend.
Peter Todd said it correctly: there is a **huge** difference between 0 conf transactions and the immediate visual confirmation that your payment was received. Payment processors can provide all of the infrastructure to tell the merchant if a double-spend is detected after 10 minutes.

Sorry for the late reply.   


Each investor gets paid the rate they chose.  


Tough question! There are a lot of moving variables there: it depends on how competitive it gets to fund a particular loan and how well you've judged the risk for the loan. If you invest early and you've picked a higher interest rate, then you can get bumped out of a listing by the end by a lender who is very competitive. If the get activated before you could react, then you've just wasted a bunch of time and you didn't earn any interest. I don't think we've ever really ran into this problem, but it's quite interesting!


I guess this is a residual problem from the previous problem. There is no way to really estimate when a loan would be funded. I have a couple of solutions in mind:  
* Get rid of the dutch auction style lending and go with risk-based pricing and lock all the lenders at the risk-based rate.  
* Still use risk-based pricing and the dutch auction: if a lender chooses the risk-based rate, then their bid can't be bumped out by a lower offer.  
The second option seems a little better. Lenders that just want to earn interest on their BTC would automatically default to the risk-based rate, while lenders who want to compete would still be able to compete on the remaining amount. This will incentivize competitive lenders to get in as early as possible and keep their bids in, because if they cancel their bid somebody can come at the risk-based rate and lock them out of the loan.

Sorry for the shameless plug, but I'm sure that there will be people in the community that might find this post appealing.
Since we launched the Beta of BitLendingClub a few days ago, we've had a surprisingly good opening and a few loans have been funded already. However, there are still some people that are trying to build up their reputation and I'm hoping to highlight some of the loans.
If you have some BTC to spare, want to earn interest on them, you're willing to take some risk and you want to help borrowers build a credit history, then please feel free to take a look at some of the loans people have been requesting on BitLendingClub:
[0.6 BTC - 66% funded - 0.2 BTC]( needed to fully fund.  
[0.7 BTC - 40% funded - 0.45 BTC]( needed to fully fund.  
[1 BTC - 40% funded -  0.6 BTC]( ) needed to fully fund.  
Most of the lenders have been offering loans at around 10-20% interest rate for the purpose of building up a credit history. Lenders are greatly appreciated.

Thanks for the recommendation, we really appreciate all of the feedback we're getting and we're making sure to prioritize all issues accordingly.  
We've been looking into that solution and it's fairly straightforward. It's a soft hit on the credit score and it only works for US customers, so while it doesn't help much when the borrower is from a foreign country, it's still useful for US residents. We have it as a very possible enhancement in our pipeline.  
I think that working closely with our customers is the first step to establishing legitimacy. This obviously involves carefully taking consideration of all the feedback we get from our customers and potential customers. I hope that the efforts we're taking to put our customers first in the process of solving their problems will be the crux of our reputation. We're treading in uncharted waters, so we'll do our best to minimize any issues along the way.

Unfortunately, that's how bitcoin lending works for the moment. Our main competitor is btcjam.com and they have processed over 1k loans, they have 825 active loans and the loans they've funded surpass 15K BTC. It is a risky venture, but what btcjam has shown is that there is a need for lending with Bitcoin and we feel like we are going to provide some competition in the market in order to give lenders/borrowers more options.
As our service matures most of those issues you're outlined should be addressed. We have a lot of solutions in the works, but as you may know it just takes time to roll them out. Bitcoin lending is certainly not for everybody and we would recommend that people exercise caution when lending.

From what I understand, Coinlenders has a slightly different model than ours: they act more like a bank where they take your deposit and they lend it out. I may be wrong about this, but it seems that they don't allow the lenders to determine who to loan money to. 
We do protect people's deposits from thefts, but we let each lender make their decision with regards to who they want to fund, what interest rate they would offer and how much they're willing to risk on a particular loan. It's strictly a p2p lending platform, so if you're looking to simply earn interest on your deposits, then I would suggest Coinlenders. However, if you're interested in being in full control of your investments, then BitLendingClub might be a better option. In essence, we're competing with btcjam and indirectly with Coinlenders. 
I think one benefit that we might have over Coinlenders is that we allow for the efficient discovery of interest rates due to the Dutch auction-style offer process. Basically, the lenders compete to offer a lower interest rate.
It's all about what the lender is interested in doing.

The nature of bitcoin lending is that there is not much one can do when a borrower defaults. We know our more mature competitors are offering some mitigation options, but that only helps if the borrower is willing to work with the lender to repay loans.
There are several things that will roll out in the very near future that will help reduce the risk of defaults: 
* WoT profile integration.
* Loan integration with the block-chain (the loan terms get placed right into the transaction that releases the funds to the borrower).  
In general, we suggest that lenders exercise caution when lending. This requires proper risk analysis, not investing too many bitcoins in a single loan and placing loan offers with appropriate interest rates (higher risk borrowers will probably get much higher interest rates).

Correct, it's like Prosper (before they got rid of the Dutch auction-style lending). The loans are not secured, unless the lender and the borrower agree to do so. Currently we just don't have the infrastructure to support secured loans, but we will be working on developing such a solution in the very near future.
The verifications we currently do are: 
* Social logins.
* Government/State ID.
* Address verification.  
We're also working on contact verification (phone, etc.).

Thank you for the constructive criticism: we are still beta and our main focus was to get the functionality right. We weren't looking to get all the static content up (t&amp;c and such), but I did provide both of our LinkedIn profiles in the [About Us]( page. The LinkedIn profile has my current employer (AdGooroo, LLC), city (Chicago) and my name is unique enough to be able to find me quite easily with a cursory google search. I will make sure the necessary corporate info within the next couple of days.
With regards to financial info and licensing, we are currently not required to register within the state of Illinois because we only facilitate bitcoin loans and we don't perform any transactions which fall under state and federal regulations, based on the FinCen clarifications.
Please let me know if you notice anything else that will help you. We are going to address those issues ASAP.   
**[Edit] Fixed spelling tjose -&gt; those**

We haven't optimized our site for ipad/iphone and other mobile devices yet, but if your device can operate a non-mobile website then you should be able to use it with your mobile device.

At the moment we don't perform any reporting to credit agencies, but we do keep track of who has defaulted or repaid a loan so in essence we are the credit agency. Furthermore, defaults are a big concern for us, not only because they can cause losses for our customers, but because we have structured our business such that it also affects our bottom line! We don't collect the 1% loan fee upfront, so the only way for us to be profitable is if the borrowers makes payments. We collect 1% from the principal of each payment, so by the time the loan is paid off we have collected the 1% loan fee.

Sounds good, please let me know what needs to be fixed and I will schedule it for the next release cycle.

A little more about us: 
BitLendingClub is a peer to peer bitcoin lending platform which uses Dutch auction-style lending in order to offer borrowers the most efficient rates and to provide lenders with the best return on investment. Another key feature of our business is that we only collect loan fees when the loan gets repaid. To be more precise: our fee is 1% of the loan and each time the borrower makes a payment, we factor out 1% to cover the loan fee. This approach gives our lenders the confidence that BitLendingClub also has a financial stake at reducing defaults.

Hi Jürgen,  
Thanks for the encouraging statements, we are also equally impressed by the amount of work you've put into your website! Looks great!  
We too require the verification of some personal information, such as social accounts, such as Google, Facebook and Linkedin (coming soon). In addition to the social accounts, we also verify IDs, addresses, phone numbers (coming soon) and now that you mentioned it it's probably going to be a good idea to add proof of income to the list as well. As far as reporting to the credit agencies, we're not sure how we'll go about it yet, but we are considering solutions which might help. One of our main goals for the near future is to integrate with bitcoin-otc web of trust and to tie all of our loans into the block-chain so individuals can get an attached credit history directly into the transactions that funds their loan.  
The issues related to Dutch auction-style lending are concerning, but we didn't have a reliable model for establishing credit ratings yet, so we determined that the best idea might be to just use the Dutch auction-style. We are considering to either modify how it works in the near future, or to come up with some model for evaluating credit risk in order to establish interest rates... not sure which path we'll take yet. One of the modifications we are considering is to allow are lenders to plugin their own risk analysis models and possibly even share them. In addition, we are also considering making the bidding process two sided: not only to lenders bid down with interest rates, but borrowers bid up with trust-related features (such as income verification, identity verification, loan details, etc.) As you know yourself all of this takes a lot of time and work, so we'll carefully consider what makes the most sense. We'll also talk to our customers and we'll try out some solutions to see what works best.  
In any case, I do like your website a lot, I'm going to sign up and take a look at how things work under the hood on your end as well.  
Best Regards,  
Kiril Gantchev

Thanks! We're working hard to deliver an awesome product for our customers and we have an "open door" policy. We're always available through chat or e-mail and if you're in the Chicago area, then we can even meetup somewhere if any of you want to grab a coffee with me. Clear and prompt communication with our customers is one of our highest priorities.  
With regards to your questions: there is a legitimate risk with Bitcoin lending at the moment, but it looks like lending is still happening on btcjam.com to the tune of 15K BTC over the past year (I think they've had around 1K loans total). Even so, the risk is still there, so I would recommend that people borrowing BTC keep that in mind. It's probably best to take out short term loans in order to minimize the risk of price fluctuation.  
We know that btcjam allows USD equivalent value loans and I suppose it's probably to address that issue, but we're still debating whether or not to support it as well. We'll take careful consideration when making that decision and we'll keep everybody posted.
