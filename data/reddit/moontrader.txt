Seriously? Have you read this guy’s responses? It’s basically just copy and pasting of the same acronyms that he clearly doesn’t understand. I’m all for sharing experiences and I’m definitely against the government holding someone’s money without due cause. That said, I’m also against people making wild claims trying to stir up a mob, yet demonstrating they obviously know little to nothing about their situation.

I asked my tax guy a week ago and he confirmed each transaction is taxable.

Just came out today for many people. Check the play store for an update.

You are the perfect example of a Reddit crypto currency subreddit not being a normal distribution of people in the world or even in the US. Many people that aren’t in software or IT and live in LCOL areas make 40-50k/year max. Contributing $1500 pre-tax a month would reduce their take home pay by 25%. That’s significant when you’re taking Home &lt;$2,300/mo.

Fiat is literally defined as currency issued by a government...
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:26:42
Lol he was not broke. He may not have made millions off bitcoin, but he definitely was not broke.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:06:57
Yea, can you believe those peasants worth a mere 30mm??
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:18:03
If you aren’t going to read my comments there is no hope for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:29:47
He did follow up, didn’t make it any better
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:31:57
Yep. Did you?

Where did this meme come from?

He would pay more in short term gains tax then the interest rate of the loan. He’s better of at least waiting til he hits 1 year. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:54:44
Lol do you even know what the original argument was about? I realize he was broke in 2013. He had already climbed out of it and started making good money from book deals and conferences years later. The point was whether he was broke a week ago when he received all those donations and he was NOT. 
I’m not dissing the guy, I love Andreas and he deserves the money but he was not broke in 2017.

As dumb as this situation may be, there are no additional tax implications. His paycheck would get taxed at the normal income tax percentage upon payment. If he immediately converted to USD he pays no additional tax. If his payment in btc goes up significantly in value, he had the cost basis of the original payment, and only pays capital gains on the additional profit.

Shouldn’t BCH be equal or greater to the amount of BTC? If those BTC addresses are lost, the BCH associated with them would also be lost. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:29:49
Wrong. You owe taxes as soon as you are awarded mined coins.

Right or wrong, hardly anyone maxes out their 401k. For most people’s salaries, contributing $1,500/mo to retirement is a massive percentage.

It would be a “taxable event”, but would generate no taxes owed.

Usually the delay is on the side of the exchange. My unconfirmed transactions show up instantly on my ledger.

What’s the deal with these olives
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:50:12
People jumped you in 2010 to steal your bitcoin that was worth around $0.08 ? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:54:15
He’s an EU citizen. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:40:15
The circle is complete 
@_date: 2017-08-29 03:24:30
Seems legit

Stocks are divisible, you just can’t typically purchase in fractional amounts.

Assuming you already have fiat deposited.

It doesn’t say anywhere in the article that they are open to cryptocurrency investments, only blockchain technology.

Consider yourself hacked

He’s spreading misinformation, he’s probably a supporter of some other exchange. Robinhood clearly states you can transfer your bitcoin to a private wallet. The only thing that’s required is you complete an extra verification step. What they will not let you do is transfer bitcoin *into* their brokerage.

You can’t just say boycott Michael. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:21:40


You must be new here
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:18:42
This is just blatant misinformation. Robinhood already said that you can withdraw all your crypto to an external wallet, as long as you complete their KYC verification. The only thing they will not let you do is transfer coins *into* their wallet. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:42:19
Well now I know why there are so many scammers in crypto. It’s this fucking easy.

It matters if you’re selling immediately after mining and using it as a source of income.
