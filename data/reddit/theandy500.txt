Here's a question.  How much did Overstock save with that $124k as opposed to if it had been purchased with credit cards?  
I think credit cards steal 3% right?  And whatever processor they use for BTC-&gt;USD probably takes about 1%?
124000 * 0.03 = 3720
124000 * 0.01 = 1240
3720-1240 = 2480.
So they saved about $2480 over credit cards?

Well, not long-term.  Gold today is worth more than it was in the 80s.  USD, however, is not.  Of course these are just relative to each other.  The point is if you have $1k worth of gold and $1k worth of USD, in 20 years one of those things is going to be worth more than $1k.

The paranoia is strong in me.  I would be worried about the bank burning down or a bank robber stealing it (not knowing what it was, just stealing it for the hell of it).  It took me awhile to convince myself the strategy I ended up using was secure in the event of theft or loss.  But even now, if someone would just come along and insure a web wallet, it would be a huge relief.  
I just e-mailed coinbase today asking if they were planning on adding insurance anytime soon and got a link to their FAQ that says they plan on it in the future.

I'm sure I'll get downvoted for even remotely defending Bitcoin users, but nobody in the US has used Gox in months and months.  And the price is still [ridiculous]% higher than it was a year ago.  The only way it affected me is it allowed me to get to my maximum investment faster (I set a maximum for myself, and I've reached it thanks to the recent price dip).
The annoying part is that people just put down the whole community and the whole concept.  As it stands now, I could send $30k to anybody in the world for practically no fee.  (We might have to pay like 1% converting to our respective currencies, but that still crushes PayPal).  I wish people could see it as a replacement for PayPal and credit cards, as opposed to a replacement for straight up cash.

Typically the value of the house will keep up with inflation.  So as the principal decreases, the 4% amount will decrease, but the value of the home will continue to increase at [inflation]%.  
So, for example, on a $300k mortgage on a $350k home, when it gets down to, let's say, $150k, the 4% is $6000.  But the home's value keeping with 2% inflation gains $7000 value (for some reason I'm assuming the value didn't increase in all the years up until that point).  But you get the point.  At some point the home is appreciating faster than the interest you're paying.
Though, to be fair, most people don't put a fraction of this much thought into it.

I disagree.  I mean I guess technically speaking they do have "the most to lose", but if they're really early adopters, how much did they really put in?  If I bought $5k worth of btc in December 2012, that's like 385 btc.  Today that's "worth" $202k.  Now to me, it can crash and be worthless and all I lost was $5k.  But that's just my opinion.

I actually e-mailed Coinbase last month and asked if they planned on adding insurance and they gave me some boilerplate response.  I'm sure if they insured user deposits they would advertise it.  Whatever insurance they have now probably just protects their own ass.
It really depends on how much btc you have.  Putting money in my bank account has no risk up until $250k (when the FDIC stops insuring it).  If I had $250k in bitcoin, I have no idea where I would feel comfortable putting it.  I would probably suck it up and pay Xapo to insure it and then immediately jump ship when someone was willing to do it for free (like Circle if it ever actually existed).

The regulations in the US exist, you can't get around them (in terms of an ATM).  When you take money out of a bank ATM, they know who you are.  It's weird that people would expect a bitcoin ATM to be any different.  But it could easily work like a bank ATM, you sign up online, they send you a card, etc.
It sounds like what you want is a bitcoin vending machine.  It's simply not legal.

Historically, real estate is a pretty poor investment.  It tends to keep up with inflation and not much more.  If I were to cash out 300 btc, I would probably put it all in stocks.  
If I wanted to buy a home, I could use some of it for a down payment and get a mortgage where I'm paying less than my rent now.  But a mortgage is a pretty sweet deal.  (Also note I don't know jack about this particular guy's mortgage, if he only had 5 years left on it then sure why not pay it off.)

Actually I didn't mention this in my comment, but part of the reason I wanted a 2-of-3 address was so that I could, for example, leave one at my parent's house, one with me, and one in like Dropbox or a common file share with a friend.  That way if I die, they can still get my Bitcoin.  If I just have it encrypted on a flash drive and I die, so do the coins.

The thing is, if you store it in more than once place, you increase the likelihood that it will be stolen.  If you store it in one place, you increase the likelihood that it will be lost.
What I want is a 2-of-3 address, so I can store the addresses in 3 different places.  That way if you lose one, you're not screwed.  If one is stolen, still not screwed.  However, I need someone to explain how to do this like I'm 5.

- You should have done it in November (assuming you're a psychic)
- Technically if you had a really good interest rate, paying it off is a losing proposition.  For example, if you had a rate of 3%, after 3 years inflation would have surpassed the rate anyway.  Basically 2014 dollars are likely worth 3%+ more than 2017 dollars, so why not pay it off in 2017 dollars?*  Also, if you're able to invest and earn more than the rate on your mortgage, that's a better bet too.

Okay, so now you're calling yourself a prophet.  What makes it worse than a paper wallet?  A paper wallet has nothing to do with cryptography, it's simply the private key printed on a piece of paper.  If it gets burned or I die and someone throws it away, it's gone forever.  If the key is actually spread between 3 people, the loss of any one is not the loss of the bitcoins.

125 and .125 are no more or less clear than the other, and certainly not more informative.  They're the exact same thing.  Maybe you would have a point if it was some weird scale or equation to get from one to the other, but it's just a decimal point.

Most of the companies that accept Bitcoin today convert it to government-backed currencies instantly.

Personally, and this is just my opinion, I think this PSA sucks.  If Bitcoin is going to go mainstream, people are going to have to trust SOMEONE.  There's a reason people don't keep their entire savings in their houses.  If you hand someone a $20 bill, you typically don't whisper "TRUST NO ONE" and then disappear into the darkness.  It's off-putting.  
There's going to have to be trust somewhere along the lines.  Probably not Gox though...

You can change the money to a precious metal and store that in a safe.  That won't lose value over time.  
I live in America, and the only reason I have no worry about my money in the bank is that it's insured by the FDIC.  Bitcoin needs an insurance company to step up and insure some place for bitcoins.  Obviously they would have to do their due diligence and not insure something like Mt.Gox...  Code audits, etc.

You are right, and you are wrong.  FDIC is an example where you're right.  But I think you are remiss to forget the housing bubble and the entire financial crisis.  If you only learn one thing from Bitcoin, I hope it is "there's room for improvement" and not "everything is great the way it is."

Because I would have to pay to convert it.  Amazon would too, but less than they have to pay a credit card processor.  That's the point.  If I can choose between paying with Bitcoin and paying with USD, if I choose Bitcoin, AMAZON would make more money than they otherwise would have.  File that under "pro" and nothing under "con" since they don't assume the risk.  It just seems like more of a "why not?" situation.

I don't know enough about btc-e, but looking at the image, it's an actual btc-e address with a bunch of garbage on the end.  
IF btc-e actually lets you withdraw simply from a url, then CSRF is way more likely than man in the middle. I say that simply because CSRF is super easy to attack compared to mitm.  
It might not be the case here, but I was surprised that nobody had suggested it.  For me, CSRF is scarier than XSS.

September 16, 2013: They sent an e-mail (to the e-mail you had registered for FTP with, I believe) saying you had to fill out a form starting September 18, 2013.
September 18-November 16 2013: Form can be filled out
Feb 28, 2014: $76 million was returned to 27500 users
April 1, 2014: $5 million was returned to 2200 users
"End of May": $X million will be returned to 1000 users who confirmed their balance before the November 2013 deadline but failed to properly fill out the rest of the form.
"End of July": "GCG is also preparing to submit the next round of Petitions to the Department of Justice for review and approval."
According to [the website]( the people who have received diddly either:
- filed duplicate petitions
- disputed their account balance
- missed the deadline
I don't know how accurate that is.  I think I missed the deadline.

Yes but it's not 3% of 2014 dollars.  3% in the 30th year of the mortgage isn't the same 3% in the first year.  3% of 2014 dollars is a lot more than 3% of 2044 dollars.  
In other words, your mortgage payment in year 1 might seem like a lot, but that same amount in year 30 won't seem like a lot (assuming your salary has kept up with inflation).  There's probably some complicated calculation that could tell you the ideal proportions - down payment, mortgage (including length), and when the best time to pay it off is.  But I think a mortgage tends to be a better deal than buying with straight cash because of the money you end up paying on the back end isn't worth as much as the money you pay now.

It seems to me the only possibilities are that they were somehow seized (like the safe deposit box) or just straight up lost.

If you're asking what the INTRINSIC value is, there is none, just like paper money (other than their paper/cloth content).  
If you're asking what the value of bitcoin is at all, it's the differences from other currencies.  Namely, it avoids banks, has low fees, and it can be sent anywhere.  Obviously it has no value to someone in sub-Saharan Africa with no internet access and nobody accepting it.  However, I can exchange bitcoin for other currencies, silver, gold, or hookers (my local hooker accepts bitcoin).  
So I guess what I'm saying is the main value right now comes in being able to transfer sums of money easier, faster, and cheaper than any other method.

You have to have buy orders in at lower values in case of a crash (I got 10 at $60 overnight a few weeks back).  The problem with this is that you have to have the cash to cover it.

I think you're overstating the effects of inflation.  
Cost is often more affected by taxes (like cigarettes and gasoline) and availability of product (like a drought increases the cost of food).  
Wages are more affected by the field you're in, your education, and how good you are at the job.  
If you suddenly lived in a country where bitcoin was the currency of choice and it was affected by 1% deflation, I think you would be more likely to see smaller raises than pay cuts year after year.

Yes, but the process is slow.  I would argue it is so slow as to not be a problem.  
It's the same as it was years ago when banks had reasonable interest rates.  Historically savings accounts always had interest rates higher than inflation.  But people didn't keep all their money in savings, they still USED money and bought things.  
In fact, I could keep all my money in precious metals and it would be worth more every year.   Why doesn't everybody do that?  There are people who do, and the world hasn't crumbled.  So why would it be an issue for bitcoin if it's not an issue for anything else?

I might be going out on a limb here, but it's possible that it is more complicated than that.  It's also possible that healthcare costs more than food.  
The way the US system is set up, the cost of healthcare is inflated beyond comprehension.  If you started from scratch with a single-payer system, we could SAVE a considerable amount of money.  There are healthcare systems in the world that cover everybody (in the particular country) and cost substantially less than what it costs in the US.  
My point is merely that it's possible to argue for universal healthcare in a selfish manner, too.  The cost of my medications plus my monthly healthcare payment plus the deductible (were I to use the whole thing) is like 6% of my salary.  So basically you could raise my taxes up to 5%  to give everyone healthcare, and I would be SAVING money.

Awesome, then who is his favorite Spice Girl?  What database is that in?  Now you need all the possible combinations of Spice Girl orders, every possible letter-to-number translation, then you need to cut some letters out because their names combined are more than 52 characters.  
But maybe he just did his favorite Batman actors in reverse order of likability, with the letter I removed from their names, because he hates the letter I.  Or maybe he used his ex-girlfriend's birthday, but not her real birthday because he could never remember that, so it's actually Olivia Wilde's birthday.  Plus seven.

By that same logic, you can write an IOU for bitcoins.  But neither of those things is relevant to your original point that a market for some reason REQUIRES 24/7 access.

As for SpaceX... would it be where it is today WITHOUT NASA?  Come on.  Or Elon Musk who made his billions from, guess what, the internet.  But I agree there's plenty of wasteful spending in government (I used to get some of it).  Where we differ is that you think ALL government spending is a waste.

Translation: "Good point, but I won't admit it."  
Without police, the only reason to not steal your car is reciprocity.  That is, basically an unspoken contract that I won't steal your shit if you won't steal mine.  That video you sent argues that you could simply pay for your own private police.  Well, what if I can't afford it?  Insurance wasn't regulated, and people couldn't afford that, so I can only assume the same would happen with private police.
So now the property rights of the rich are more important than those of the poor.  Without a government to protect this minority, they just get screwed.  But fortunately for them, they won't have a lot of stuff to steal for very long.

See, the thing is, if USD withdrawals once again became possible on MtGox, the price would drop, but the price on other exchanges would go up, as people bought on those and sold on MtGox.  So I think a correct estimate would be a volume-based average INCLUDING MtGox.

I can use your own argument:
1. Bitcoin is a limited resource
2. Bitcoin is imaginary (your argument)
3. There can only be 21 million Bitcoins ever
4. If I can imagine one Bitcoin, I can imagine 22 million Bitcoins.
5. The Bitcoins in my imagination are fundamentally different from the Bitcoin as defined (since it's not limited in my imagination)
Either 1 or 2 HAS to be false.

Your counter: 


Response: Phone numbers are neither imaginary nor physical.
Your counter: Neither are arguments

The more uses it gets, the higher the value will go.  If you want the value to be stable, you basically want it to stop growing.

It sounds like I could just freeze your bitcoins permanently.  Is that really escrow if the arbitrator can't really make a binding decision?

I take it you're not trying to buy right now then.
