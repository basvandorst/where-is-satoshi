Not much to discuss, high 11k to low 11k
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:26:33
I thought 19k was low, it was supposed to go to 50k by february
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:46:57
It would be so cool if every fiat crashed and we became the richest people in the world - delusional nut
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:17:57
Had a friend who did some really safe investing (guaranteed 6% a year little risk), told him about bitcoin and he got in at 16k, doesn't blame me though, good guy
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:08:33
Going to sleep now, better be 12k when I wake up tomorrow
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:14:07
Back in early December, everyone was so enthusiastic about bitcoin reaching 20-30k, what happened? Why is everyone saying it will drop to 7-8k now? What changed? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:37:02
11.4k, we're at an ATH since 2 weeks ago
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:45:13
Sure! 30k by christmas predictions were wrong so yours should be correct!
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:38:22
1) Set up a price alert for when you want to sell.
2) Forget about crypts.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:54:55
Bought at 13k, sold at 17.7k, told myself I would just focus on school, couldn't resist when price hit 10.5
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:27:26
What the hell happened to the 25k by new years prediction? Did everyone just give up on it? I bought in at 18k and I'm still waiting
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:03:52
Who else bought in at 19k?
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:50:47
By that time, 1tb will be like 1gb today
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:22:19
I'm putting another $30 in when it reaches 9k.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:03:31
What the hell is a "cryptocurrency boss"?
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:30:47
Main issue I have is its too volatile, I'm fine with putting in a little money for fun and small profits but I can't be risking my life savings
edit: what I mean is I'd rather let the government win than lose 20% of my money on bitcoin because it is so volatile
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:49:58
Good for you man, I just hope to hodl enough to buy an rx 580 for my gaming rig by christmas
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:02:45
I agree, the media hype spurred a good jump, it should correct itself soon
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:44:14
well he definitely manipulated me
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:25:03
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:58:35
mutual funds are 8% per year, this is 8% per week!
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:29:25
What the hell, why was my 18k thread removed and not yours
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:09:06
Im good ill stick with coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:09:57
Agree but mutual funds is the safest
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:21:59
What? Futures will drop pries?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:24:53
Brexit and Trump in one year, this can happen, buy in folks
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:40:16
I sold everything at 17.7k and upgraded my workstation, best decision this year
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:12:11
Sell when you need the money and only that amount.
There is no rule where you have to sell it all at once.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:49:20
Its weird how a meme caused billions of dollars of change
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:37:13
I'm going to HODL too no doubt, but fuck I shouldn't have bought at 16.5k
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:51:51
Yeah its hell for those of us who already invested at let's say 15k and don't want to buy anymore 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:08:22
Wish I had a cousin who was a developer for coinbase, he can send me some information and I throw a bag of cash into his backyard for no reason.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:49:17
Not impossible, but I'm predicting either 8k to 25k by Christmas
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:32:26
!Remindme 22 days
I'll give you gold with my earnings if bitcoin is above your prediction. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:57:43
Media hype, people feel like they're missing out
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:40:56
Dude just use coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:09:43
I interpreted your title as celebrating when drops to 10k because some of us really want to buy in lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:49:53
I put in $25 into coinbase as a joke/bandwagon at 10,800. I made $11 when the price rose to 16,000 a week later. Free dinner for me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:51:29
Update us with what car you're thinking of buying
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:29:37
I invested $25 and made $9 a couple days later (free dinner!) although I lost most of it by buying more
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:40:22
What if someone bought at 17k and it drops down to 5k and never recovers?
Do they be sad?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:11:38
I bought a total of $75 for the lols at 9k. I made a little money for no work ����
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:07:01
I hope they tell their parents
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:41:42
Live with roommates, dont tell them about it ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:36:28
Same here, I thought if I waited it was going to jump to 20k overnight, everyone keeps joking about hodling and buying in asap but ignoring the fact that futures is going to cause mass panic
Anyways IMO its better to buy and regret rather than regret missing out
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:58:41
This is true. 
Even my friend who I didn't consider smart but is very careful with what he invests in is putting some into bitcoin.
He's done way more research than me and really believes it will go somewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:05:50
I was afraid no one will ever say it
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:03:04
Yeah futures is scary, I'm calling maybe a dip down to 12-13k, I won't sell out now but I'd buy after the next week
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:32:21
Anyone who predicted the buy wall and bought in at ~~13.5k yesterday, fucking genius
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:10:51
Wait, you guys really don't think it will dip below 10k again? I'm really waiting this one out before I drop some more money in, I would hate for me to buy then it drops to 9k the next day
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:30:58
I'm using mines as a nest egg and I promised myself to never panic sell regardless
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:08:51
I was just thinking this, I do believe cryptocurrency will gain support but why bitcoin?
Just because it has the largest market cap and seniority doesn't mean crap
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:17:04
I bought in at 10.8k (ATH at the time and it dipped to 9.5k) and I am completely at peace with that now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:32:25
So price will shoot up momentarily then correct itself, economics is so complicated
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:03:14
How did you screenshot coinbase? I used a screenshotting app and it came out black
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:38:24
Well from what I've heard, ideally you want to sell when you need the money, not all of it at once
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:12:59
Alexa, tell me everytime bitcoin changes in price
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:46:08
I bought at 10.8, 12.5, 15.7 and 16.5, I'll just set up a high alert and forget about all this
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:09:01
Do it with your refund check.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:26:41
We are.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:23:43
I said the same thing at 12k all time high and bought in, look where I am now
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:29:47
Thats my bank!
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:52:28
IMEI codes
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:49:07
I think bt will definitely drop just due to panic selling, I'll keep hodl but keep a close eye on those days
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:07:44
From now on you hodl, understood?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:06:24
Shoot down due to panic selling, but it will definitely go back up after the 18th
I'm going to sell tomorrow then back back in during the dip
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:59:28
Panic selling due to futures, I doubt anything will happen but I know a lot of people will sell out
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:07:49
Im gonna be optimistic and say its a good change for btc, expect 20k by the 18th
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:20:16
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:29:13
I'm probably never going to sell it and just keep it there as novelty. Fees were $3.50, I would need it to hit $12,198 to profit.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:23:26
Wait what? There are 21 million bitcoins but if one person owns more than 1 bitcoin then there are less than 21 million people who have bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:37:13
It will hit morning news tomorrow.
Expect 12k by the end of this week.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:18:22
I really can't believe it.
I bought in at 10,815 and within 5 minutes the biggest drop happened in 24 hours. Am I cursed?
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:05:37
redditors think their comments can move a 200bil market
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:16:46

God damn it Bill Gates, go to his IAMA and ctr-F "crypt"
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:19:44
This is why Im switching to tether
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:06:32
Upvote this spike is helping you cope with v-day blues
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:42:10
Shoot me if I ever sell at a loss, set up a high price alert and ignore ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:14:38
I'm calling it! 20k by the end of this week! Buy now
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:02:39
Really trying to resist buying more right now, I cost averaged down to 11k from 13k :D, but I already put in way more than I'm comfortable with
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:42:13
Comment here if you bought at 19k so we can cry together
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:03:50
10-20 people?
Do you guys have like 10 million each to spend or something?
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:27:04
9450 is holding unexpectedly
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:06:08
I do believe btc will recover past 10k. The scary thing is when, I hope it doesn't take 2 years
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:57:39
I already forget that I put money in back in November lmao
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:15:08
I wish I knew a whale so I knew when to sell or buy
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:14:28
Don't be too greedy, its the huge spikes that cause crashes, I'd be happy with an increase of $100 every day
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:43:24
DUMP ALL USD INVESTMENTS, PUT IT INTO CRYPTS ����
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:34:57
I blame the new corporate tax bill, its causing confusion, btc follows USD and we all cry
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:56:51
Its ok, slow growth is good
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:35:00
Someone out there holds the world record for highest price purchased (19.5k)
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:53:40
Feels like november all over again &lt;3
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:23:27
Not really, all he did was never sell at a loss
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:08:16
yeah its weird, I feel more comfortable when I know why, for example the china ban and the facebook ads ban but what the hell is causing this
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:10:01
Bullshit. What about the experts who claimed 25k by 1/1/2018?
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:58:48
I'll run around campus naked if btc hits 15k within 24 hours and post it on youtube
edit: boxers with briefs underneath
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:24:16
Whether the price increases or decreases, it is good for bitcoin! If it decreases I can buy more and it's on sale, but if it increases then its going to the MOON!!
The price can go to $0.01 and I won't even care, even if it shoots up to 100k, I still won't sell, cryptocurrencies are the future and I shitpost optimistic shit here to cope with crashes.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:24:47
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:20:31
Fuck I bought more at 11 and didn't buy anything after it dipped below 8k
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:52:09
It should be 100%, but I'll take it
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:51:22
I began stocks/crypts investing 3 months ago for the first time and both of them crash
Mom was right
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:47:39
we got an expert right here
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:47:52
All the newbs dropped out, now we can go back up without interference
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:29:54
Why is 9450 holding but not 9500? Lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:11:48
Are you afraid of alt coins getting more attention?
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:11:59
I forked some of my bitcoin to alts and I just put it back in because of fomo and lost $120 in transaction fees, bitcoin is king
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:57:19
Thats my bank! literally I use BoA
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:12:55
Whos we?
If btc isnt profitable it wouldnt be this big, you should thank the greedy investors
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:44:56
Talk to the manager, have them talk to corporate
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:04:25
No she said to focus on your career
