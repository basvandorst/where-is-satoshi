Pssh. Bitcoin is for rookies. Real investors go all in on scratchcards.

Google turned up [this]( Looks like your own experience matches up with recent trends among all the cryptocurrencies. I don't know anything about most of these, but it's interesting that *all* the correlations are positive and fairly strong.

That's not the strength of bitcoin. Anyone trading USDs for bitcoin in order to reduce risk is a reckless fool.

I bet you also didn't play the winning lottery numbers last week. It's like you don't even want to be a billionaire.

This is good news if you see bitcoin as a commodity to invest in, but I don't know if this is good for a currency. It's still instability. If this was happening to the USD, we'd all be hoarding cash and no one would want to risk buying anything unless they had to because the price of everything would be lower tomorrow.
Call me boring, but I want cryptocoins to be stable, reliable, and liquid.

That comparison is ridiculous.

Is the other half on red?

Have you noticed correlations in the values of the different cryptocoins?
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:27:07
So you believe that a catastrophic collapse of the USD is more likely than a catastrophic collapse of bitcoin?
It's hard to imagine the USD collapsing without taking down bitcoin with it.

I'm just saying that your cryptocurrency risk exposure has increased and if you were happy with the risk exposure you had before, then you should rebalance back to 5% crypto and 95% traditional (stocks and bonds, not USD besides what you need to have on hand or in case of small emergencies) to re-establish it. Personally, I don't think I could take the stress, but if you acknowledge the risk, you're not letting libertarian cryptocurrency ideology cloud your judgment, and you're young, I don't think 20% is out of the question. I'm not a financial expert though.

So long as you're thinking clearly and not putting money into bitcoin that you can't afford to lose, that sounds perfectly reasonable. If you've gone from 5% to 20% though, your risk has obviously increased and it's time to think about whether you want to rebalance.
If you make no moves and next year crypto becomes 50% of your portfolio, I'd be happy for you but my opinion about the risk of bitcoin compared to the USD would not change. What would change my opinion is if the 5 yr return on bitcoin becomes predictable.
