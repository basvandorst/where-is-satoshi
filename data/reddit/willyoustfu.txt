There's a lot of shitcoins but also a lot of clueless ideological people too. IMHO it's great for altcoins to keep bitcoin on its toes and push us towards a workable implementation of the original vision. I'm anxious and optimistic for Lightening Network to roll out and start making bitcoin more viable for real world use. I'm also pretty big on the technology behind Ethereum, but I see it as serving a vastly different purpose than bitcoin.

Consider our beloved moron Uncle Bob again. He's a dummy, but he knows not to carry around $11k in USD. But does know he also shouldn't carry around his unencrypted bitcoin wallet containing his 1 BTC with him on his phone or laptop? Does he know wallets can be encrypted with a passphrase? Does he know he can set up multiple wallets and keep most of his bitcoin in cold storage? There's a lot to learn.

OK, I'm going to HODL back my memes for some real talk for a moment.     
I was just reading some FUD over in about how undecillions of dollars of cryptocurrency have been stolen over the years. The article (which essentially just badly re-stated a few tidbits from a Bloomburg article it cited) was mostly misleading bullshit. But the state of bitcoin security does concern me. Not the network or algorithms (which have proven quite resilient to attack), but users management of their keys and exchange credentials.       
Bitcoin lets you be your own bank, which is among the reasons I love it. But it does also mean the end user assumes many of the liabilities of a traditional bank. For bitcoin to go to the moon, it must gain widespread adoption, and widespread adoption is predecated on widespread trust. I don't see that happening if Uncle Bob can easily lose all his magical internet money just because he was dumb enough to open an email titled "Anna Nicole Smiths Huge Fake Tits" and download "seethemtitties.jpeg.exe".          
Obviously Uncle Bob could have saved himself the pain by using a hardwallet and 2FA. But that's a pretty big barrier to entry for most people, on top of the barrier to entry cryptocurrency already represents. As a sysadmin I can tell you that a significant percentage of users are either profoundly retarded or just don't care about security or both. When my institution rolled out mandatory 2FA so many luddites keeled over from rage stroke that we had to dig a mass grave so big it would make any genocidal dictator green with envy.
We need user education on a massive scale, and we need to make buying, holding, and spending bitcoin at least as simple and secure as using a credit card, and I don't really see a concerted effort to accomplish those goals at the moment.

Shit, I misspoke. The price is determined by GDAX but when you buy they are not necessarily executing a GDAX order on your behalf for a premium. That can't always be the case because I know that it's possible to buy on Coinbase even if GDAX is down (in which case they say the price is determined by other markets). TBH I had not considered the idea of buying on Coinbase to guarantee there's a seller at the listed price.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:40:26

You're right, it's a poor analogy. But cryptocurrencies are unlike any banknote or coin. Traditional currencies have been around for millennia, and their risks and use cases are well understood. This is not *yet* the case for cryptocurrencies. It's going to take time and effort to get society up to speed. I believe cryptocurrency is a revolution that has enormous potential to change the world, and I want to make that revolution as fast and as pain-free as possible.

Yep, I saw somebody in the daily thread yesterday who wanted to invest their $2k scholarship in bitcoin and when everyone told them that was a fucking awful idea they just said "what's another $2k on top of $38k in debt?" Later they asked about some automated arbitrage trading scheme powered by "lol neural networks" and I told them it looked scammy as fuck. They replied saying that they already wired the company money and were freaking out.         
        
For the love of god people, don't fucking invest in anything if you are not willing to do some research first, and only invest relative to the risk of losses. IMHO if you're not already at least maxing out employer-matched 401k and your yearly IRA contributions, you shouldn't be investing any great deal of money in bitcoin.

Sadly, your bitcoin was most likely sodl away in a government auction. It makes me sad to think how much btc I left in a certain market account because at the time it didn't seem worth the effort of finding the usb key with my gpg key on it to sign on and move it. Now that pocket change would be enough to pay for all the weed and acid I ever bought on there.

I ordered a Nitrokey and a U2F Zero. As mentioned, there's the Yubikey which is very popular. I went with the former two by virtue of them being open source and open hardware.

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:14
A bunch of BCH got bought immediately after trading opened and it drove up the price. Trading was halted at this inflated price. After BCH trading was halted for some time all of the orders were cleared in which case GDAX determines the price based on other exchanges which are not trading at the inflated price.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:41:25
You should check out the section about limit orders in the trading rules. After that just google how to read a market depth chart. Basically it represents the cumulative sum of bid limit orders (to the left of the mid-market price) and ask limit orders (to the right). If for example you see a 200 BTC bid/buy wall at $13,000 that means that there people on the market are signaling that collectively they are willing to buy 200 BTC at that price. For the market price to fall below that price, either at least 200 BTC of market sell orders must be executed first to "eat" the wall, or people who placed those limit orders must cancel them, or more likely some combination of both. Ask/sell limit walls are similar.          
          
edit: Just keep in mind that because limit orders on the book can be canceled at any time up until they are filled, a big buy/sell wall cannot necessarily be relied up on to mean that it will take great time or effort for the price to move beyond that point. People have a tendency to cancel their orders and re-place them further away if they think it might get them a better price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:52:07
From the order history it looks like there was at least a $3000 spread at the time BCH hit $9500. I don't know what the book actually looked like at that time so it's possible that if you sold you'd have gotten an even lower price than that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:44:49

I would think "I didn't know I needed to report this" would be a Mistake of Law and not a Mistake of Fact, which can only be used as a defense in certain specific circumstances such as if your financial adviser mistakenly told you that you didn't need to report your bitcoin.

Take a look at the order books for BCH/USD and BCH/BTC.

    3.2Coinbase may cancel Open Orders in the following circumstances.
    
    a. Orders placed by Traders who, in our sole discretion, have engaged in abusive use of the platform, for example, Market Manipulation, or using the API in a manner which unreasonably burdens the platform.
    
    b. Orders which under the circumstances involve an obvious error with respect to price, quantity, or other parameters - a ‘clearly erroneous transaction’.
    
    c. If required by any applicable law or regulation, including specifically where Coinbase is required to suspend or terminate a Trader’s GDAX Account or Coinbase Account.
    
    d. If required for technical reasons as set out in section 3.4 or 3.5. below.

Limit orders are filled first-come-first-serve. If there's already 100 BTC of orders at some price, all 100 of them will have go get eaten before yours gets a chance. Placing an order a few cents away lets you jump the line without losing much.

There's very little information on their website. Especially information that you would really want to know before forking over your money and signing a contract. They have (very coarse) trading reports dated back to 2009 but their domain was registered in 2016. They don't really say anything about their algorithm except "lol neural networks." "This means the number of successful bids by the robot always exceeds the number of unprofitable ones" ok suuuuure. Misspellings on the website. Trading statistics page is mysteriously missing. A guarantee that any losses are covered by them. You forfeit all profits and take a 30% penalty if you cancel your contract or decide not to subscribe after the trial period. And so on and so forth. I'm sure there's a lot more concerning things further down in their terms of service but I stopped reading.

Not everything that is associated with the field of computer science is itself science. I don't see that bitcoin makes any hypothesis or does an experiment to falsify it.

The thing about bubbles is that no one can tell you if it is a bubble or when it will burst. Or at least, it is essentially impossible to tell the difference between someone who can tell you that and the multitude of others making predictions that will be wildly incorrect.

Just remember that you'll owe capital gains if you sell any.

Ok, and what I'm saying is that trading was halted at this ridiculously inflated price, but it per the trading rules if trading is halted and all orders are canceled, the price gets determined by other exchanges. Since those other exchanges didn't experience the huge artificial price jump, the price "magically" went back down to 3k or so. edit: I guess I'm saying it's fishy as fuck the price rose so fast, but not fishy that it dropped again.

Of course sell-bitcoin.net has no content if you navigate to it, and the domain is registered with WhoisGuard. The IP belongs to OVH, a French VPS provider. Time to report this fuck for abuse.

To copypasta a comment I made yesterday:        


Of course, remaining safe if ECDSA is broken by QC would require everyone immediately move their coins to a new address with a public key that isn't actually publicly known. So presumably a lot of coin would get stolen before everyone had a chance to protect their coins. Bitcoin would take a huge shit in the process, but it theoretically could survive until a quantum-resistant alternative to ECDSA could be implemented.           
Now, the government on the other hand... I can easily see them spoiling bitcoin for us.

ECDSA--which is used to generate your keypair--is vulnerable to being cracked by QC, however SHA256 and RIPEMD160--which are used to generate your address from your public key--are not; at least until human beings learn to generate and harness obscenely huge amounts of energy (see: Landauer's principle). A QC capable of breaking ECDSA would enable its owner to derive the corresponding private key to any known public key, and use it to transfer coins from it. However, your public key isn't actually public until you make a transfer. Your bitcoin address is only a hash (using a combination of SHA256 and RIPEMD160) of your public key. So if ECDSA is broken, bitcoin could still be safe assuming you move all your remaining coins to a new address as change for every new transaction.

WordPress is a [turd]( but this is a hardened version. It's still very likely to be doable, but I wouldn't bother personally trying.

Personally, I would not be comfortable entrusting a single person with that bitcoin. You could keep a copy of the keys in a safety deposit box, or set up multisig or something.

I interpolated the observations. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:10:53
Oops. I meant to say three parameters. Anyway, I tried to replicate their results. I had to use data from blockchain.info, which very likely is both calculated differently and taken at different intervals than the data FundStrat is using. Here's what I got:        
    Linear regression model:
        market_price ~ 1 + n_uniq_addr_sqrd + trade_vol_usd
    
    Estimated Coefficients:
                                  Estimate                   SE                  tStat                 pValue        
                            ____________________    ____________________    ________________    _____________________
    
        (Intercept)             36.2635973524626        13.8887237734277    2.61101004988257      0.00915319348229295
        n_uniq_addr_sqrd    3.77748994995626e-09    1.57081011659022e-10    24.0480368063589    1.35012784973686e-102
        trade_vol_usd        5.9051556591788e-06    1.64560438777199e-07    35.8844185337515    4.93598648221995e-186
    
    
    Number of observations: 1078, Error degrees of freedom: 1075
    Root Mean Squared Error: 391
    R-squared: 0.818,  Adjusted R-Squared 0.817
    F-statistic vs. constant model: 2.41e+03, p-value = 0         
And a plot:           
That adjusted R^2 value is about 13% less than theirs, but I suspect that it could be accounted for by the difference in the data we're using, rather than FundStrat lying about their model. You can also see that the intercepts, standard errors, and t-stats of my modal are similar to theirs (although my trade volume coefficient is off by some factor, since I forgot to normalize it by the number of addresses).         
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:56:06
Overfitting? The model only has three parameters. There are plenty of reasons not to get too excited about this model, but I don't see overfitting as one of them. Unless overfitting has a different meaning in finance than it does in scientific computing.

That makes me feel okay about the 4 coins I had on a encrypted hard drive I forgot the password to in 2010.

Good question. Your bitcoin address is only a *hash* of your public key, not the public key itself. (Your private key is used to derive your public key, which is used to derive your address) So you can create a wallet and receive bitcoin without the network ever knowing your public key. However, to transfer bitcoin *out* of that wallet, you must sign your transaction with your private key, and tell the network your public key so that they can verify your transaction is valid. This is why it's generally a good idea not to re-use addresses.

imho security is a much more difficult problem to tackle than high fees. Bitcoin lets you be your own bank, which is revolutionary and I love it, but that means you must assume some of the risks that a traditional bank mitigates. If you download malware that steals your credentials to your traditional bank, that bank will probably detect any fraudulent activity pretty damn quickly and take action on your behalf to limit your losses. If you're lax with your bitcoin private key and it's stolen, you will lose every last satoshi immediately and without recourse.        
        
A significant portion of the population would find hardware wallets very confusing, don't know or don't care how to determine if a website is legitimate,  download random executables from any website that promises a peak at some tits, and expect the government or some other institution to swoop in and save they day any time they get in trouble. Shit, I'm a sysadmin and I nearly fell for an *extremely* convincing spear phishing email the other day. If bitcoin is to become trusted and widely used, we're going to have to develop effective and **easy** measures ordinary people can take so they can hold and spend bitcoin safely, and that's a monumental task.

I recommend cashing out your 401k, selling your car, taking out loans, maxing out your credit cards with cash advances, killing your wife for the insurance money, and turning tricks on the street so that you can buy as much bitcoin as you possibly can. /s

Bitcoin private keys use [Base58Check]( encoding. Try to verify the supposed private key with that scheme. DO NOT use an online service to do this, because they might be a scam to steal your keys. If the check fails, look for characters that are not valid in Base58 encoding, and that may give you some idea of the mistake you made. If you need help validating the key, I can help you find a legit script you can run on your own machine to do that.

Are there currently any consumer tax filing websites that allow you to upload an 8949, csv, or otherwise painlessly record your crypto trades? My employer pays for TurboTax online but you have to manually enter every single trade and that's gonna be a no go.

If I've learned anything from this sub, it's that you should *clearly* buy 3 grand of bitcoin tomorrow if you have no idea what you're doing.

There have been various cases that have ruled differently in the past few years on whether an order to surrender a private key constitutes a violation of an individuals 5th amendment rights. It could be interesting to see how this plays out, seeing as that could be necessary in order to seize a persons bitcoin.

It absolutely baffles me that so many of my peers thought it was a good idea to take out huge loans to pay for college. I went to community college for 2 years (and was fortunate enough that my mother could pay for it) and then paid my own way through my bachelors and masters degrees at an inexpensive state school. I have so many friends who are totally fucked by their student loans right now. It's frightening to think that the same scenario is playing out all across the country, nearly to an entire generation.
