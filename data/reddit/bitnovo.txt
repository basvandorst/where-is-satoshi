From the app you get the exact amount of bitcoins that we will send when the voucher is redeemed. 
Due to the actual bitcoin fees, small amount vouchers are highly impacted. This is not due to the exchange rate but to the fees kept by the miners. 
We are working for users to be able to select the fees when redeeming the vouchers and a final summary will appear with all the totals and bitcoin fees. 
Smaller vouchers are more useful with Dash that will be soon available for voucher redemption.

Please check current bitcoin recommended fees:
In a voucher of 50€ would be nearly 50% of the voucher.

BTC_Forever, thanks for your comments! We totally understand your points, but unfortunately, still not many places accept BTC payments. 
About this point I can argue it with our card. 
everybody knows your identity
Our card has no name and can be used up to 2.500€ with no ID verification. No name cards do not leave payer names on merchants. So your payments are anonymous. 
Nevertheless, we totally understand your other points. 
We really look forward for a total Bitcoin world!

Our wallet is a BIP32 compatible wallet that allows the user to import their seed from any other wallet. The advantage is that you do not need to download any other application in order to redeem. User will always have the private keys and Bitnovo will never know or have access to the wallet section. 
Nevertheless, all the transactions are on chain and we will always send bitcoin to the address.

You said it right, a Telco company could be a bank but a BTC company should never be a bank! Choose your favourite wallet and that's the best thing!
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:39:07
Banks are something from the past! Why banking when you can be your own bank?
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:28:59
Many thanks! Wish we could reach all the countries soon and that these retailers soon accept cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:47:08
