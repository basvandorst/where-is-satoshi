Mixed feelings.
On the one hand, it adds a level of legitimacy, raises awareness and likely increases adoption, and is healthy for the progression of crypto.
On the other hand, the value of the coin can shift control to a much smaller set of hands. Whether that is good or bad is unpredictable, it depends what bets are made on the futures. I see this as a big con, because it makes the rich much richer and you'll likely hear less stories of rags to riches from average people.

They committed to this project months ago... It would have been hard for them to predict the massive influx of users over the past month and the rocketing growth of the space.
If you've ever worked on a software team you'd understand that people want to put out their month long projects regardless of whether or not the timing makes sense to the end users.

Definitely between $0 - $Infinity for the "future".

Guaranteed is a terrible word to use in the crypto world.

I only have a small amount invested in BTC. 
My approach is not that of day trader, I'm in it for the long haul and see this as a 10/10 risk investment opportunity. I'm fully ready to lose 100% of the money I put into this. As an insider of the industry, I believe in the tech.
It's very personal though. I think you should set limits at what makes you happy. Just remember never be too greedy. Cash in on a good thing if it makes you happy and stick to your limits.

It boggles my mind that people sell while things are trending upwards... set a lower limit where you're comfortable with your losses and have it sell at that point, not while the trend is going up with no signs of slowing down. You sold at $12k for what reason? There was no threat to the growth... but live and learn.
At this point its absolutely unpredictable. It could dip in the next 24 hours, it could keep rising. No one knows. You have to make a choice for the amount of risk you're willing to take.
From my perspective, its not smart to buy on upward spirals and the ROI is too low relative to the risk.

You won't crack it... 
Also besides the point this is far too sketch and I wouldn't help anyone trying to "recover" coins from a wallet.

Your original statement makes no sense in that context then... OP could easily be kicking himself in the opposite direction if the correction ends up being higher than the current price.
The point is no one, and I mean absolutely no one, has any idea where the market is headed towards. That's why I don't think that type of vocabulary makes sense in such an unstable market.
