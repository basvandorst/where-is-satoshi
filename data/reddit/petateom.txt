Heroin is not legal in Portugal, is legal in UK for hospitalary use.
@_date: 2019-10-12 12:24:27
1. Read your own article, it clearly says, when you get caught your drugs are confiscated, you are forced to do a detox course, pay a fine or get an advised (this is usually available the first time you get caught, no more) decriminalize means you don't go to jail, is a infraction not a crime. The max ammount of heroin you can have is 1g, according to psychonautwiki, that isn't a lot for a addict (im Spain is 3g, and in Czech Republic is 1.5g) so you can go to jail with 2g in portugal.
2. You say "heroin is legal" in the first instance, legal is not decriminalize, there are two very different things.
Drug possesion is decriminalize in a small ammounts, but thats not legal.
 
If something is legal there are a regulatory way to trade it, alcohol is legal, tobacco as well, heroin is ILLEGAL. Just accept the true, you were wrong in your first post, stop try to distort what you say.
EDIT: this is more clear about what happen in Portugal: 
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:31:40

@_date: 2019-10-12 10:53:13
Decriminalized isn't legalize, you can't buy heroin in a store. If police find your heroin you will have to pay a small fine and your drugs gets confiscated, is not different than the spanish or netherlands law, the only difference are that the fines are lower.

My opinion about Ross is the same as yours, he didn't deserve the same penal as the Chapo.
The blood crimes weren't demonstrated.
