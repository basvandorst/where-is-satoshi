Ok, I signed up &amp; got a wallet on blockchain.info. Then I looked up the transaction, &amp; got this:
What do I do from there? Which string do I have to do something to?

Circle's instant, as opposed to the 3 day delay on Coinbase. Adding Debit/Credit cards to Circle is real quick, whereas Coinbase doesn't accept Debit cards (only real CC's). And their bank verification takes a few days. FWIW, I ditched Coinbase for Circle completely. Happier w/ them.

Quote: The system works as follows: to make a deposit you should to generate a temporary transit address and send bitcoins to there. This address contains important information about your deposit (your username, the amount of the deposit and the selected investment plan). After coming of bitcoins to the transit address Blockchain.info should send them to the address (wallet) of Bitcoin Income project. But because of the API failure bitcoins are not sent and still are on transit addresses. This means that money is not available to trade and we can't use these funds (because we did not get them).

At one point I was considering using BitWage to get my paycheck in BTC, and I was looking for an address I could input into their payout field which would automatically distribute an amount of BTC defined in both BTC numerically (Satoshis), &amp; percentages of what's left after the fixed amounts were deducted. I would imagine if such a service could do that, it would also be able to do the opposite: Deduct a fixed amount after a percentage was deducted.
This way I could have a number of addresses automatically filled with a set amount of BTC so that I could make payments in BTC to various places, each with their own 'bucket/address' to draw funds from.
For example, so I could pay a BTCJam loan out of one address, send an amount to Coinbase (or somethine else which would automatically cash out to my bank) for cashing out to my bank account, another address for holding BTC, another address to use to buy LTC with, and another address for using for purchases with BTC at places where BTC is accepted.
That's my 2 cents.

If you had an address to send to, it had to have come from somewhere. Adresses live on the blockchain- not in wallets. Wallets just provide an interface to manipulate the addresses in the wallet.
This is why miners don't have to keep a wallet app running 24/7 so they can collect the mined funds. Anything going to the address does so without interacting with a wallet, but rather interacting with an address on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-05-21 02:55:37


As long as the address was valid &amp; exists in a wallet of yours, you'll be ok.
Did you copy the address from a wallet of yours? Maybe another implementation of your seed on another instance of Electrum?
@_date: 2015-05-17 17:46:58
I recommend Butter-Bot. It features a backtesting engine you can use to test your settings.
However I haven't found any settings that work in the down market lately. Best I was able to do backtesting was -2.xx% with a 0%/100% BTC/LTC ratio due to LTC being more volitile.
Better to buy (&amp; hold) using dollar cost averaging nowadays.

Last I knew, the best you could do is cash out BTC using some other alt which allows realtime deposits on whatever other exchange, using it in place of fiat.
There's talk of the technical details re: programming it, on an old bitcointalk thread from ButterBot's 'Pablo', right around the time BTC broke $1k Thanksgiving a few years ago.

Aside from Real Estate, which can offer the luxury of bank financing for expansion once positive income is generated from rentals, I would invest some in Litecoin, as it's firmly positioned as a second place to Bitcoin in the crypto world. I believe sometime in the future, some organization will utilize it as a redundancy measure in case some unforseen catastrophe happens with whatever high availability banking infrastructure is built on Bitcoin. 
I also like the Proof of Stake system being rolled out with BitShares being the leader in that space currently. Ethereum looks good, too- some serious industry interest there.
-My 2 cents.

If you do decide to invest in the stock market now, while the prices are low, CapitalOne's platform is the only one I know of where you can buy fractions of shares of stock. All the others require that you buy in whole-share increments.

The .deb returns 'malformed maintainer email address' during install on Mint, using Software Manager. You have to 'Ignore &amp; Install Anyway'. Surely an overlooked detail due to its being beta software. It appears to install properly however, in the Other category of my menu. When I run it it asks me to configure an OKPay account, which I don't have, &amp; it closes the whole app if you click Cancel at this point. I don't want to create yet another account just to use their app, so to be uninstalled it goes... I had hope for a wholly p2p thing, but this OKPay thing discourages me from attending their party. :-(
EDIT: I'm using xUbuntu, not Mint as previously stated in error.

You can always find someone on the net saying bitcoin is currently undervalued- if you keep looking hard enough. What matters is who you want to believe. Personally, I believe Litecoin is the better speculative currency. It seems to have better ups &amp; downs for gains if you're into that sort of thing. Long term no one knows, but the point is to invest what you can afford to lose, &amp; diversify. Stocks are extra low right now, &amp; I made serious money on my play money investing account on Investopedia lately. I stopped investing in BTC last January when the market went sideways. If it ever gets to being up &amp; down like it used to be before its peak, I'd put my extra money there in BTC. If I had the money, I'd do 'dollar-cost-averaging' &amp; buy a set amount of BTC whenever I could afford it.

I think that's what we saw awhile back when there was a flood of $300 orders in the 'bearwhale' incident. Based on how that went, I wouldn't worry about it too much. It might help to spread it out over the course of a few days though.

Circle is instant once you get your CC added, which in my case took a month the first time, &amp; no time at all the next time a few months later. Coinbase takes a couple business days if the funding source isn't a bonafide CC (meaning not a Debit VISA/MC). I've had good experiences with both. Be sure to enable 2FA tho-

The effort it would take to do such a thing makes it viable only for huge transactions where a high value windfall would result. You're safe from that working with something like Localbitcoins.

When you backup your wallet, which you might want to do after each transaction, do so using the built in option in the wallet app rather than just copy/pasting the wallet file in Windows Explorer. By doing so, you greatly reduce the risk of it becoming corrupted &amp; unusable. 
Disregard if using Electrum, which doesn't need the file to be backed up.

In the U.S., the 'Patriot Act' requires banks to verify the home address of their customers- otherwise they can't do business with them. If you walk into a bank &amp; open an account, they have to check your ID. Same goes for currency exchanges, apparently.

I've been using it for the past 2 months &amp; it just now paid for itself after the most recent price spike &amp; subsequent correction. It thrives on volitility, so BTC is great for it. The forum thread mentioned above is great to follow for insights on its development, the devs really listen to the customers well. The community is vocal &amp; I learn a lot from them. 
The bot is easy to configure, although I stick with the recommended settings since I'm a noob. The devs recommend certain settings based on what exchange you use- you can find them in the forum threead. They've already figured out what are the most profitable settings to recommend. Some members share more profitable settings in the thread, you can try but I don't.
The bot has a powerful backtesting feature that let's you test your settings to see how profitable they really are in a minute or so. So when you do set your own settings you aren't flying blind.
New features are always coming out, too. We just got per-exchange settings instead of just global settings in a recent update. So now we can use different settings on all 3 exchanges at once. BTCChina &amp; AltCoins support is coming soon too. 
All you need is like $300 to get started with it. I recommend it over mining.

BTC-e doesn't support a 'planned trade' per se. But you can submit an order into the queue, and wait for the market to shift such that it eventually becomes an attractive deal &amp; someone will eventually fill your order. In theory at least. It could be that your price is ridiculous &amp; no one will touch it, but it's been my experience that you wait long enough &amp; the market will shift, making orders that once were unattractive attractive after 12-24 hours.
