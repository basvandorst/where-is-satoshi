Here is a question I have to everyone investing in bitcoin. Doesn't buying one and just having it sit in your account go against every reason why bitcoin is supposedly going to be successful? 
Is it a currency or an investment?

THANK. YOU. I have absolutely no skin in the game when it comes to bitcoin, but I'm a business finance major so I like to think I at least have a basic understanding of economics and financial markets. People here don't seem to understand the downsides to an unregulated market. There are guys out there that own a large enough amount of bitcoin to alter the market AND there is no regulation on the damn thing. How is that a recipe for success, especially as the interest in bitcoin dies down?

Volume is all that matters when you are talking about a speculative fiat commodity. What's your background in finance/stock markets?

If the US dollar collapses we have much much bigger problems than retaining the value of our measly bank accounts. That is not a valid reason to invest in my mind.

But isn't everyone "hodling" a get rich schemer? The point of bitcoin is to be used as a currency. Everyone just holding onto it doesn't really want to use bitcoin as it is intended, they just want to make money off of it.

Where can I track the total number of bitcoins being sold and the total number of bitcoins being bought daily? Is there a site that tracks this for all stocks?

Here's a question I have to bitcoin investors. If the trading volume of bitcoin is directly related to the price, and the trading volume has steadily decreased every month since the new year started, how do you foresee the price increasing rather than decreasing as interest fades and other better coins take more of the market?

Isn't the point that new investors aren't really entering the market. The same reason why bitcoin's price has fallen so much in 2018.
