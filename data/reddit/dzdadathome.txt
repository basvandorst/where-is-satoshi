When you buy crypto on an exchange that enforces KYC you are right, your wallets can be traced and linked to your identity.
Trading via bank transfer on a P2P platform is better for anonymity, more so even if you trade cash in hand. It is not about illegal trading, I get it. That narrative blows and is pushed that somehow wanting privacy = drug dealer etc.
P2P trading should be likened to buying gum for cash. Its anonymous and we do non KYC transactions all the time.
There are a few steps to buying bitcoin anonymously, certainly via bank transfer lessens that risk of exposure. If you buy btc from me for example it would only show in my bank account that you paid me, not what for like when you pay a friend. High volumes might trigger a bank to ask the seller wtf that was for however so do bear that in mind lol.
Some P2P traders will ask for a proof of ID, such as a photo holding up a drivers license or similar. There is nothing they can do with this info unless if you want to be super paranoid (they are working for the feds lol). It is just there to safeguard them according to their risk ratio. 
Basically the account sending payment in the name jon doe for example can be verified as yours (assuming here you name is jon doe lol) and not coming from a stolen bank account. Similar to any merchant online payment.
Pick a trader with a good reputation, they are there to make a bit of money trading. They will not want to mess about and use the above mentioned step as they take the risk.
Some traders however will not require ID if they have a higher risk appetite. First and foremost pick an exchange without KYC to use. You data will not be kept by a third party, and no danger of a honeypot attack on ID which is a serious issue. Larger exchanges do take heavy precautions against this happening though to be fair.
Full discloser, I am a community manager for a p2p trading exchange localcoinswap. They do not require KYC to use but as mentioned above depending on the trader ID might be asked for. This advice however runs for any P2P trading or OTC service you may use.
Using TOR and different email addresses too are favourites of people wanting extra privacy layers.
Here is a link to staying safe when P2P trading that you might find useful too!

There is a bs misconception that kyc means legitimate.. KYC goes to unknown third party info honeypots. All it does is restrict a large demographic of the worlds population from being banked. It doesn't stop money laundering/crime as recent bank frauds and huge money laundering operations the world over attest to.

181 fiat types - 34 payment methods, free registration, no kyc etc and dedicated community / team on telegram, discord. Also cold storage wallets and other altcoins to learn about/purchase etc. They have dedicated information on each listing.
Sure you heard it before but as a young man new to btc/crypto. Never invest more than you can afford to loose, start small and build up! Never give keys to anyone or passwords, no exchange admin will ever ask you for them. Never open in telegram especially any links with .scr .exe .piv!
Good luck and welcome to crypto!
