Using his real name, not hiding behind something that is a throwaway reddit account.

Yes, they sought to overtake, and I guess eventually completely replace, Bitcoin Core.

Not sure what to write, this is a momentous moment.

Thanks for the site :-) I struggled with the tor part and failed to get it working initially so stuck to the regular network, will have another shot at it soon and will give you some more feedback.
One of your links isn't working now though, the bitcoin core with screen I think.
Thanks again :-)

Localbitcoins should work as the other person said... Just a thought, it's maybe not recommend to go putting your phone number online. Just use PM's to share details ;-) from a fellow brit

So you'll sell immediately after recouping your loss? That ain't hodling son.
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:40:17
Yah, me too. Sounds like a pyramid scheme. 
Edit: woah woah woah kiddies. I know and have btc. I know (and don't have) bch too. Just the "preallocate 70%" bit that seemed pryamiddy

Late to the party but I've got a couple of friends from the UK vanlifing in New Zealand for a year, they've just started and are finding work as they go, could they hit you up for advice on where's good for temp jobs over the winter?
Got my own node running on a pi here in the UK too, followed the guide for one with a screen on pinode.co.uk.
@_date: 2019-02-26 19:45:20
It's fairly hard to fault
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:48:37
Dude you're awesome, thank you. Got a BTC receive address? I'd like to buy you a beer
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:54:22
Googled, fell asleep during a browse but I understand there's some sneaky fast hardware and good faith business deals. Will dive in some more, thanks :-)
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:55:14
I've gotta do mine. Is there a guide to follow? I've got a ledger nano
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:46:06
Shit dude if you can't figure that out you'll struggle to get a hang of this magical Internet money.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:55:54
I really couldn't say, initially the block chain has to be downloaded but it's been ticking away and I've not noticed a drop in my bandwidth. However I'm living solo with a 50/15 connection
@_date: 2019-02-07 12:39:32
Please elaborate on any of these many reasons for the greater good
@_date: 2017-04-23 22:30:45
And this.
@_date: 2017-04-23 22:12:55
I think the organisational requirements demand some sort of central hub. Would like an example of this not being the case. Maybe ant colonies.
Edit: Clarity.
@_date: 2017-04-23 22:30:01
I'm in the UK too and i transfer money from nationwide to Fidor then to local bitcoins with no issues. Fidors sign up process is awesome too, they video chat and confirm passport # and your face there. I did mine off my phone without issue.

@_date: 2017-09-23 23:51:36
I just read this and it made a whole lot of sense 
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:11:50
Ah cool, thanks
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:52:06
Are the number of leading zeros all that's used to determine difficulty or is there another multiplier? Seems like it'd be a fairly coarse level of adjustment to just have one more or fewer noughts.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:29:31
Dollars. Btc is the best investment around imo. I have 1 and I'm keeping it till it hits 6 figures at least
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:25:57
Yeah that joke will never leave the mempool
@_date: 2019-09-17 23:10:24
This needs to be higher
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:47:16
Sorry I'm not following, doesn't the BTC still exist on the block chain? It's just locked there, no? I wouldn't have thought this would affect the price.
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:36:12
Ok, how?
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:08:15
Oh. I need to get down with the kids
@_date: 2017-07-07 16:46:56
Interesting, seems to have slowed down a bit over time, still fairly impressiveincrease in difficulty though. Possibly throttled by the supply of GPU's, as is the word on the www street.
God damn I think I wana work in bitcoin/block-chains somehow one day.
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:20:31
Is it that the nonce can be any one of a very large number of options, which is what takes the computational effort to go through them all? Or does the (using your example) checking the sum equals 1000 each time take effort? Or a combination of both?
@_date: 2017-07-06 11:27:07
So it's literally massive numbers of options... Crazy how it all works!
I'd like to see how those numbers change in a few months, I guess the difficulty is still increasing exponentially. 
Thanks for explaining, happy mining :-)
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:45:39
[I was intrigued at how price compared so made this](
Edit: Looks like difficulty trails price by about 6 months so we are expecting another hike in difficulty in about 3 months... BIP148 is in 1.5 months which might lead to an even more rapid and sustained increase than before.
@_date: 2018-12-30 12:34:57
Maybe they meant "always" not "also". I think it was a compliment
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:21:25
Hodling but curious
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:06:28
I read it as Bitcoin-related general content
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:15:01
Edit: it just happened to land on 4000 when I enlarged the curve.
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:50:04


Edit: At very good rates!
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:23:30
I could've made that bolder in hindsight, I can barely see it on my phone. Next post will be better...
