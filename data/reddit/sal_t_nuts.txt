I find it a good thing. I hope more people realise now how unsave online wallets are. Other companies should learn about this breach and strengthen it. If you realy want security put your cold storage in a safe in a bank (I know kinda funny.. but it's more secure then your house. you also have a saving account inside a bank without them even knowing it.)

Hello, ETH hodler here. I'm jealous. Ok bye!

I think im moving all my BTC to ETH when the price hits &gt;1000€ again.

This is good for markets like Bitsquare. They currently wont support PayPal because it is too easy to chargeback.

So what you are saying is that if we can find his password and tweet "i love bitcoin" all over, we can manipulate the market? His password is probably the nuclear code or something. Hmmm!

Your coins are not stored in Coinbase. The keys to the coins are. With multisig they cannot even touch your keys. Even if their database get's compromised. Your keys are always safe. Unless you leak your info ofcourse..

Pff good luck maybe they can find some lost files or play some of my games. Or read boring text and spam e-mail. Get in my computer and get shot with penis enlargement ads and winner pop ups.

What do you consider a dip at this moment? I think 500€ is lowest but 650€ is best time to buy. Or aiming to low?
@_date: 2017-01-07 14:22:24
That is ofcourse, if everyone has only one adress.

@_date: 2017-01-06 12:43:38

Welcome to the 4%! Only 4% own 1BTC or more!

Crypto currency is not hardware though. You have euro, dolar and other currency so it's perfectly possible.

Why the fuck would you give your money to a bank? You can hold it yourself.

I live in Belgium. The only thing i found is a website for ordering food (pizza.be). Payed in bitcoin once and it went pretty smooth and fast. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 00:56:44
What am i going to do? I'd buy a nice house and a car. Get my wings and buy a small airplane to travel around the world. Searching for other investments and stuff. Get education in the things i love.
Who am i kidding... Blackjack and hookers with cocaïne up their butt!

Belgium here. Yup this is indeed possible. You can also make online payments by opening the app and scan the QR code with your mobile.

Time to put my savings into BTC. Screw 0,01% interest annually..... i dont even care if BTC will fall or not i want to buy a house by 2022. Im young and stupid with a great income so why the hell not. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 12:44:15
So is the video. Good job gentlemen.
@_date: 2016-07-07 00:41:03
So all you are saying is that i have to buy them after the halving and profit 4 months later. Seems easy enough.
