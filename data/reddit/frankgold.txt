Voluntary charity to people in extreme poverty is very different than state enforced UBI schemes, stealing from one to give to another. 
Misleading title.

Here are some more facts for you, if you don't like the first link I have given:
Plus, if you can get $1.3 and then make it $100, you can be born into any class of family, and you'll soon be rich anyways. Google bootstrapping. 
My main point still stands: Most millionaires are self-made and being born into wealth isn't as much as an advantage as most people think. 
Also notice: That wealth is most likely dissipated in 2nd or 3rd generation. 
Like lottery winners, those whore are born into wealth, don't know the value of the money, because they didn't need to earn it themselves.
If being born into wealth was so important, most of the rich people would be 2nd or later generations, not 1st gen. 
Also, education is already free, online. Everyone with internet access has a chance to the best education available, either free or at very low cost.
So, you still don't have a single valid argument.

If something is state enforced by state monopoly on violence, yes it is theft.
If you can fund private companies paying dividends for a voluntary version of UBI, that would be much different than, state-enforced UBI discussions of today.

Most millionaires in USA is self-made, first generation millionaires. Almost %80 of them now.

Aaaand the experiment is rigged:
"Here's how the experiment will work
Working in rural Kenya, we'll conduct a randomized control trial comparing 4 groups of villages:
Long-term basic income: 40 villages with recipients receiving roughly $0.75 (nominal) per adult per day, delivered monthly for 12 years
Short-term basic income: 80 villages with recipients receiving the same monthly amount, but only for 2 years
Control group: 100 villages not receiving cash transfers
More than 16,000 people will receive some type of cash transfer, with more than 6,000 receiving a long-term basic income.
We will use an independent contractor for all research surveying, publicly register the study to mitigate publication bias, and publish a pre-analysis plan that will guide how analysis is conducted to prevent cherry-picking.
While payments for the long-term group will continue for 12 years, we'll have results on how long-term cash transfers influence short-term decisions and welfare within the first 1-2 years."
They compare people who get cash paid monthly for 12 years, and then same monthly cash paid for only 2 years, to people who get nothing as control group.
I believe the control group should be, the same money invested in business projects in similar villages with extreme poverty. Say, just like how Kiva works, another charity-smallbiz loan organization.
Of course if you give money to people, they will be better off. The thing is, is it better to give money away unconditionally, or is better to fund profitable small businesses in such communities, with the same money. 
$0.75/(person*day) doesn't sound much, but it is 19.7 million for the 6000 recipients over 12 years. 
I can't help but wonder what could be done with 19.7 million dollars, in 40 poor villages for 6000 people. I bet, if invested in good profitable small businesses, it would be much better for the villages involved. 
But we'll never know because there is no "experiment" comparing charity to business investment. Only charity to less charity to no charity. 
Even if this experiment is proven successful in the end, it will only prove charity is better than nothing. Duh, captain obvious...

I have no problem with a rich bitcoin owner, donating his own money to people in extreme poverty. 
But this is not state enforced UBI. That is well debunked...

 If you are talking about a state enforcing a UBI program, you are still talking about theft-extortion. You are not talking about dividends of any kind.
 An employee works for wage, because he values the money more than the future dividends from the house he is building. Otherwise, he would want % of the house instead of immediate wage. This is called time preference.
 Automation doesn't replace/destroy jobs, but it creates even more jobs. You simply fail to understand basic economics, explained by bastiat 200 years ago...
 
There is no valid argument for a state enforced welfare, including state enforced UBI.

Actually, capitalism is what makes extreme poverty to be reduced/eliminated. 
Extreme poverty in the world has been reduced to less than %10 of global population, compared to %90 of global population, from 1820 to 2015, in 200 years.
It is projected to totally disappear in the next decade.

That's it. It all requires one single country with loose Bitcoin or strict financial privacy laws. I believe, in the future, just like there are now financial save havens around the world, like Panama or Hong Kong, there will be countries and businesses who compete for part of the bitcoin biz. And it does not have to be an official country. Someone may set up a bank on "Sealand" or other "no one's land". If "black market money" becomes bit coin, and considering it is more than all "legitimate money", it won't be in any bank's interest to refuse all that money. It would be like, trying to ban all Internet. Since now Internet is the driver of innovation and profits, what's the point?

But you could have a bank in Russia accepting bitcoins, open an account there, and then cash out and use your bitcoins. There, a ban totally overcome.
