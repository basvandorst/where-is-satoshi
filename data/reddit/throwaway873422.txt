Now 1 pound of Uranium-235 contains 3.7 x 10^13 Joules.
So forget gold, we can say that 1 bitcoin is equal to 0.2 ounces of uranium-235 at the current rate.

If people thought there was going to be a crash, BTC would go down.

What do you think happens if you come into a huge sum of money? Envy.
People around you will try to beg, scam, borrow or steal from you. You'll never be sure if new friends really like you, or your money. Or they'll just be envious and bitter around you. Other people paying for meals will be awkward. Either way it's horrible for friendships. Don't tell people you're wealthy.

Here's my question just for risk mitigation. Because I am afraid of the dumb money and don't want to get burned. BTC was always a fun thing to hold or trade for me, I never anticipated having more value in BTC than everything else put together.  It's easier and also more satisfying to diversify into other crypto rather than cash out altogether. I don't need cash right now and I firmly believe some kind of cryptocurrency will be here to stay. BTC has huge first mover advantage but technical limitations I'm skeptical can be overcome. And it could well be that it stays as "digital gold" for a long time to come even with those limitations.
But if there is a BTC dip, will that put a huge dent in all crypto? It's like they say, in a crisis, everything correlates.

Funny how people accept swings the other way like it's normal. Ever hear of easy come, easy go?
Pretty typical, this ain't nothing.

Nothing. You need to lie and say you've lost it all or sold it. 
Seriously, take this advice from an adult. Never tell anyone who you wouldn't trust with your life that you hold Bitcoin. Because if it really does go up a LOT, you will be a target for everyone. I know it is nearly impossible for teenagers to realize this, but just fucking listen.
Hide. Your. Wealth.

Every time I trade I lose money, regret it and hate myself.
The only thing about having Bitcoin that's made me happy is only thinking about it once a year or so. So these days I just hodl.

I can tell you about the last month: the futures markets adopting BTC and people hearing it's growing on the news and piling in.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:37:22
I just realized.
It's going to be really, really funny seeing so many normal people find out how damn volatile cryptocurrency can be. Some of us found this out a few years ago. No way off Mr Bones' Wild Ride.

Not gaining money is not the same as losing money. It FEELS like it, but it isn't. You're falling for a psychological bias known as a break even effect.

How about $400 of Bitcoin and $50 each of the next 4 or so? Plus a secure wallet. Then he'll have the fun of a diversified portfolio.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:33:52
Do not do this.

I guess the kind of people who trade alts are also going to be much readier to rebalance their positions if they slide.
The interesting exception from historic data is Ripple which pretty much did its own thing from 2014 and stayed steady until June of this year.

I'm seriously thinking that a business digging through landfill for wallet.dats in old computer hard drives and USB sticks might be a viable proposition.

Same situation as you and I feel the same way. I think we need a lot more calm on this because right now the dumb money is coming in. Thing is that lots of people are now waiting to buy on the dip and bitcoin is eating up the news cycle so they'll keep coming in even with a 50% correction. It would take 70% or 80% to really put it in a bear market. Hopefully the futures market should stop another 2x rise (yes I hold BTC and I'm hoping it stops going up so damn fast, because that is toxic to adoption)
There are a lot of different cryptos out there but speculation is far ahead of adoption.

This is why diversifying is basically useless in this sector. If one goes down they all go down. There is no hedging in a crisis.
Irritating though it is, it's basically bitcoin or bust.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:24:04
Seriously, good. We need the stupid money to stop coming in at this point. There is zero fundamental reason for BTC to be worth 10x more than it was a month ago. What needs to happen is rollout of Lightning etc (if this thing really works) so BTC is a competitive payment system.

You move next to a hydroelectric plant in China, buy an ASIC mining rig (if you can find one) and superglue it to your laptop.

Just give it to your mom and tell her not to give it back to you till 2025.

I didn't say it was that much money, but yeah, it's a bit too much for me to sleep at night now. I'll try to 
1. diversify a little into alts
2. buy some stocks with 1/2 to 1/3 or so
I happen to think US stocks should also do quite well the next couple years though it won't give the highs of crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:04:40
Sure. Like, everywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:32:28
And someone else out there thought BTC was a good deal at 19500.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:12:10
As for your first link it seems like the alts are actually MORE volatile than BTC in a slump.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:22:27
I'm sure someone will give you a Fiat for bitcoin. Personally I'd like a Tesla.
