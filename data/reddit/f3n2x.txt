It doesn't add up at all. Dubious background, dubious behavior, dubious conclusions etc.
Satoshi wants to be annonymous. Why jump all the hoops to do so but use your real name? (As someone who's proficient in the field of security) Why go for a free meal if you're technically a millionaire? Why answer questions in such an unclear, misunderstandable and prossibly compromising way?
If his name wasn't "Satoshi" and "Nakamoto", there would be less circumstantial evidence than there is for thousands of other people around the world.

Which video are you referring to? [This one]( has nothing to do with either german or russian. He's talking in a subtle east asian accent and the pronounciation of "Bitcoin" is consistent with it.

Still, there is nothing inconsistent about his pronounciation of "Bitcoin". I don't see how this strange phrase at the end is relevant in any way. Everything about this whole thing just smells like shitty journalism.

It's unsure if the HD7000 will be as powerful for mining as the 5000/6000 because AMD is dropping it's VLIW-paradigm, basically making the architecture look much more like nvidias fermi.

If everybody in the world disappers, even most houses are worthless because most of them are so far away from sustainable water and food sources that you couldn't live in them anymore. This is a pretty dumb scenario for fundamental value.
Gold is not just pretty and durable for generations (think about jewelry) but a very important resource for many industries. Even your computer contains gold because of it's properties.

Yep, many BTC guild members are mining on deepbit right now because the servers are down for maintenance after DDOS. Once the servers are back online it should swing back.
