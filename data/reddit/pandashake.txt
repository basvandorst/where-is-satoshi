They’re both reputable so go with aesthetics

Horsey answered op’s question that the focus is decentralization. Anonymity is not what makes btc useful nor does it facilitate that in the first place so I just restated Horsey’s point when you brought anonymity back up. Upvoted you because btc discussion is what the community is all about and shouldn’t be downvoted imo.

I really like [Andreas]( Very well spoken on the tech behind btc.

Buy a hardware wallet, ledger or Trezor, preferably directly from them through official site. Look up mt gox on wiki to see why it’s best to have control of your own coins. Transfer them to gdax, a coinbase company, before sending them elsewhere for zero fees.

The point isn’t to guarantee anonymity. Monero exist for those interested.

So has it finally been exposed or when people start to withdraw? Cryptocurrency is more than just bitcoin you know. They only count for 33% of the entire market.

That higher price is probably the avg price of btc across all exchanges. I use another portfolio tracker and usually has options to display what exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:58:01
A million is only 90 coins. That's a drop in the bucket in terms of btc traded in 24h.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:42:18
One new thing is ledger and trezor are not affected by meltdown or spectre. The private key is stored in it’s secure chip. They can even be used on a compromised computer.

Binance for alt trading. No need to verify there. If you’re using coinbase, transfer to gdax before moving it to binance. It’s free this way.

80% if all btc has been mined. If you’re worried about supply and demand, imagine what demand would be like if supply is fixed if btc continues to be a going concern.

Nations would be much more equipped than simple conspiracy theorists to determine the legitimacy of the moon landing. They would have taken every chance to embarrass the US. It's been 50 years. Looks like anniversary is soon!

Context is required here, I specifically linked the space race. You are equating the Apollo 11 mission, a feat of science and math, to tragedies and war crimes. Your write up talks about leaks, hold leaks to a high regard, and denounce rebuttals as censorship and propaganda, but disinformation campaign is just as prevalent. False statements being leaked to sow seeds of doubt to create conspiracy theorists. Also, get back to me when Russia finishes leaking the truth of the moon landing. Hopefully before the mars landing.

So people shouldn’t have bought between 12 to 20k, a time of nearly a month as it consistently hit ATH, because it was overdue for a correction at any moment? Telling when the correction was coming is simply hindsight.

I hopped over to r/btc for first time today. Nearly every pro bch thread, basically front page, gets the op tipped. Roundabout paid advertisement, if you will.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:03:33
Really impressed by Valkenburgh, really well spoken. A great segment with arguments against and counterarguments/rebuttals for crypto currency.

Try the [faq]( lots of good points for crypto there.

I heard good things about both, but I went with ledger simply because of aesthetics. It works well, love it.

It can take several hours. Just because gdax says complete, it doesn't relate to the actual confirmation on the blockchain. You can view your transfer by looking up your gdax wallet address on blockchain info.

I have the nano and it's great, very intuitive. So far, they remain to be very secure as long as it wasn't already initialized with a passphrase when you boot it up. Yup, some keeps spending amounts on software wallets or on exchanges for spending/trading.

With cash, depends on how much change or how fast the cashier can do. Sometimes they gotta bust out those quarter rolls when they run out. With cc, the point is the $ is exchanged. No banking wait time.
@_date: 2018-05-08 09:04:03
You don’t have to carry cash, pockets full of change, counterfeits, or human error when making change. In international places, you won’t have to worry about having local currency.

It's not untraceable and wasn't designed to be. It's only psuedo-anonymous. Bitcoin for illegal activities is a stale argument.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:31:39
The difference between bank and cc is that with cc, you get the funds deposited immediately after fees. With bank, it takes about 4 business days for the funds to transfer to your coinbase wallet before you can buy btc with it.
For when to buy, many will say yesterday. If you want to experiment, only buy what you can afford to lose like you're going to the casino for a day of fun. If you do use cc, transfer those funds to the gdax account and buy btc over there instead. Your coinbase and gdax accounts are linked.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:12:04
Look up gdax as well. It is owned by the coinbase company and you can transfer funds between the two for free. One advantage is gdax offers lesser fees.

That’s a good looking pizza. Unfortunately, best places where I live are just chains.
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:44:24
Say bye bye to that chunk of pie because Binance is the only exchange in JP right 
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:32:57
Not required.

On their support, all they say about withdrawals is they’re planning and monthly gold sub not needed to deal in crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:32:42
They plan to allow coin withdrawal in the future. Not operating in my state, but when they do, I’ll be pretty excited as my go to for btc purchases.
