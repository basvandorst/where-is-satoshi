I'm sure they would be perfectly okay with it.  However, IF this isn't a completely hypothetical situation, I would suggest you talk with a CPA or tax attorney to handle your filing this year.  They may know of a few ways to help you keep some of your easily earned gains.

Nick Colas was fear mongering about a bear market back in 2015 as well.  I think we can all see what has happened since then.  His "expert" opinion is nothing more than a guess.

Yup. They are the same account, or they are at least linked, so verifying on one platform works for the other. It did for me at least.

I'm not really sure that all of those transactions will matter too much.  I imagine all they will really care about is your ability to show that your books balance out in terms of absolute amount of coin.

The price swing today looks big, but you've really only lost $20 so far.  There's a very real possibility that you will lose a bunch more.  If you are holding for the long term, stop checking the price and forget about it.  Come back in a year and check on it.  If you are hoping to make a quick buck, then realize you are gambling and accept that you'll maybe lose your money.  Never gamble more than you are comfortable losing.

Buy some bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:30:31
I had this problem.  I completed the process on the Coinbase website after a few attempts with GDAX.  Give it a try.

BTC price will jump, and then there will be some who decide to sell to take profit.  We'll see where the price lands in a few hours I suppose.  It's gonna be a wild ride.

You can just transfer your balance to another wallet by providing that wallets address to Coinbase.  There are lots of different wallets that you can use, but I recommend a hardware wallet if you are not trading and plan on hodling.
I guess the biggest downside to keeping your balance on a web wallet like Coinbase would be the risk of hack.  Coinbase maintains the private keys to your wallet.  If they are compromised by a hack you'll lose all of your bitcoin.

No way to really know. Most agree that futures trading will help reduce volatility though.

Yeah, the feds will probably require you to claim it as a short term gain.  This is one of the few times I can honestly hope that you don't have a very high income.  The new tax plan should lower your bracket at least...

If you don't have any transaction record for that 5th coin, then you will unfortunately have to record the cost basis as $0 for that coin.  Your next best option is to create a very detailed spreadsheet recording your purchases and sales along with amounts paid and fees.  I'm not entirely sure the IRS will accept a record of your own making without any receipt, but it is better than nothing.

Just set her up with a wallet and buy it for her.  Don't let her risk losing her coin due to user error when you can mitigate the risk.  Just explain the finer points of the wallet to her.

You don't seem cut out for this.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:11:33
It'll be a while before it shows up.  I've waited for 12 hours before.  Just be sure of the address you sent it to and relax.

Because they are idiots that see what they want to see in the charts. There were 6 other "bull traps" this year that ended up being solid foundations for rocket launches.

I can't speak to the probability of a hack actually taking place, but what happened to Mt Gox is enough of a reason for me to store my funds somewhere else.  The root of the issue really comes down to your private key.  If you don't have control over your private key, you really don't have full control of anything.
I see it as a small task to transfer my assets for the extra security.  It's probably not a big deal if you have very few assets, but anything over a few hundred dollars is worth the little bit of effort to me.

I recon you can afford a $14k Hyundai if you have $2 mil in the bank.  You may want to buy used though.
