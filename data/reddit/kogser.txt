There is definitely something strange happening.
 The Euro Price on Coinbase cannot be correct. It's higher than the USD Price.
Everywhere else I checked the Euro Price per Bitcoin is at about 12-13k. Coinbase have 14.5k.
Either an bug in their system or a big arbitrage possiblity...

The Dashboard shows a different price than when you click buy.
Also the price on Coinbase on Tradingview shows currently 14700€

Looks like BitFury is also out of NYA.
With the same explanation that the agreement should prevent a fork.

I don't think Bitcoin Cash need a scaling debate at all. As no one uses their chain (blocksize average of under 100kb and less than 100 tx per block), they will survive a long time without thinking about scaling again. 
The last blocks bigger than 1MB were on 15/09. But even those blocks had just a few large transactions but not much transactions.

Here is a short description of how to split your coins.

I think it's legit if you own more than a fraction of one BTC.
But it would sound cool if you say, I own 3000000 Bits for example.

There is no one who replays your transaction on purpose. This happens automatically whenever you create a transaction.
Your transaction will be broadcast to the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin and the 2x chain share the same mempool. This means, whenever you send a transaction on one of the two chains, the other chain will automatically also see your transaction. 
The Bitcoin miners take your transaction from the mempool and put it into a block. The 2X miners don't see the Bitcoin blocks and so don't know that your transaction was already put into one block on the other side. So the 2x miners will add your transaction also to their side of the chain.
As long as both chains work on the exactly same network, it happens automatically (for the 2x fork this is the case). If someone create a fork and make sure they create their own network parallel to the bitcoin network (with no Node that connects to both networks), someone need to take your transaction manually and replay it to the other network (this is not the case here).
After some time, when the 2X miners create their real first 2MB block and they try to broadcast this block to the network, the Bitcoin Nodes will block all nodes which try to broadcast this invalid block. This should result in blocking all 2X nodes after some time and "maybe" split also the network, so that transactions sent from one side will not reach the other side. But this is not guaranteed.
