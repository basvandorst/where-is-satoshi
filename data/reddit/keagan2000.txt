Yes, with very little or no fees also. If one Bitcoin is 600USD you will end up with 600USD per Bitcoin you liquidate if you use the right exchange

I'm also 12 but have managed to get into Mt. Gox without spending any money. I mined at 60 cents a day for about a week and transfered it from my bitcoin wallet to my Mt Gox account by using the address you get when under ''Funding Options''

I found a really nice one for 6 dollars a month, but there TOS says no bitcoin mining, although my friend knows the owner and I may be able to get around it sonehow

Ive started Pool Mining KrugerCoin with a 0.002 difficulty when i started, its at 0.2 now. Ive been CPU mining because KrugerCoin doesnt support GPU mining and its been going pretty well
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:42:16
Was it confirmed? 
@_date: 2013-07-10 15:43:33
I'll check out prime coin, do they have a pool system like BTC? If they do what's in your opinion the best pool
@_date: 2013-07-19 16:22:49
Yeah I emailed about it, I pointed cgminer to there client and all my blocks were refused, its because I was using my GPU. They didn`t explain how they knew this though.

It's not my company, I just noticed this when browsing for a good VPS to bitcoin mine on, on the topic do you know any good ones? I'm more interested in the processing power over the RAM, obviously

Eastern Canada? Plz be eastern I'm here and there are no BTC atms in my province.
@_date: 2013-09-30 22:38:38
But the miner is in investment, so although it's not instant, over time that miner will make more BTC then he could have bought with the cost
