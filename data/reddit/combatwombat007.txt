I don't think you understand the effect $2b of fake money could have on the market.
And if you come back with "but crypto market cap is $600b+," then you REALLY don't understand.

Yeah, that's why they don't allow you to do that. In fact, I don't think any exchange besides Kraken does.
Basically, no one wants to hold the hot potato.

OP made a very emotional post, but it's not worthless.
Tether claims they have $2b in a bank account. They provide no evidence it's true.
Considering the shady history linked to Tether, only a fool would accept their claim w/o evidence.
If the claim is false, and we all find out, that could be a big problem for btc.

If that's your argument, further discussion is hopeless.
I'll just point to the fact that Tether, themselves, make no claims that they hold "assets equal to or greater than" the Tether they've issued. They specifically state that they hold cold, hard cash.
If holding backup BTC were as good as cash, don't you think they'd explain that? They're not doing that because it's not the same.
You haven't thought this through. Good luck to you.

Your response indicates you don't understand how this all falls apart in a falling market.
Tether's saving grace in that case may only be that people want it more than crypto during a bear market. But it's not sustainable if it's not actually backed up with hard cash.

And what if you go and sell that btc and you can only get $6 for it?
How good are you for those IOUs now?

Don't be daft. r/investing doesn't like bitcoin because you can't invest in bitcoin. You can speculate, and that's fine, but it's not investing.

What? Baited into trolling?

You have just described exactly why bitcoin exists in the first place. Please go learn your history.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:48:01
Have any of you actually *looked at* the history report you downloaded?
I've been trying to download multiple different reports for months and they're all empty.

My neighbor said that trash day moved to Tuesday.

I rarely tell people they should have *less* of an imagination, but it seems like pretty apt advice around these parts.

I think a lot of people (not necessarily me) would argue about the ability of LN to solve scaling problems.

Sounds like you've got a big job ahead of you. Better get to work!

The one question to answer (that's already been asked) that completely breaks this strategy:
How will you be identifying the "lowest point after the fork before prices rise again?"?

The great thing about this gif is you can flip it 180º and use it again tomorrow during the correction. :)
