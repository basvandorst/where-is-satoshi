Well yes and no - if difficulty would be really low so would hashpower need to be. Less hashpower = less power necessary. But as hashpower dictates difficulty and not the other way around as more and more people in the world want a piece of the pie hashpower goes up and with it electricity consumed. Mind you with more demand the price whent up too, else BTC would be still be worth nothing like in the beginning

Works for me
Just use something like tunnel bear and you could test it yourself, assuming it's ip based

I agree but we are on the bitcoin reddit so I assume normal market was dropped from consideration.
Everytime someone asks me about crypto I tell them the same thing: treat it like a visit to the casino, don't invest what you can't afford to lose and if the need a comparison they shall imagine the highest risk stock market option and double that in dealing with crypto

The more total hashpower exist the higher difficulty rises keeping the average time to mine one block at a steady rate.

One possibility:
~210TH (15x14TH) sha-256  (15x1500W) for 0.07c/kwh
sounds about right
mind you 15 of those machines would set him back upwards of 60k$ which means if all would stay the same which it wont, it'll take a min of 4.5months to ROI.
On the other hand a diverse investment of 60k could yield at least 10k with a very conservative strategy per month.

Well you asked for environmental aspects. The only point I see that would turn for the better is if it dies and/or every coin was mined, i.e mining not being lucrative anymore. Which both would raise the question of who does the work confirming transactions then. As not enough people would do it for free which would leed it to crash.
Simple economy it's like a painting you need to look at the whole thing to see and not just one pixel.
Off to bed, someone else take over please

Keyword here is difficulty level

That would mean BTC would represent about a fifth of the worlds GDP, dream on. Mind you technically it's possible but then a bottle of water would cost 10000$ too.

Every BTC owner could invest 10% into renewable energy that would make for a mighty big project and create a lot of clean energy and jobs

Additionally each and every one of those legs will need to have equal or more coin then you want to send. So it's not as simple. But as I see it can lessen the loads of a lot of recurring transactions (buying coffee, mining profit, etc)

There are several options with a bank transfer

I hear you though I would need to earn a million first to buy some land to begin with around here
I lived nearly 10 years all over the world working and saving money just to come back and not even being able to afford a decent sized flat :(

Have a look at Lykke - I've been using it for 4 months now and no issues yet.
