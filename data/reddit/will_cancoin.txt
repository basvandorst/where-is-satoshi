We just launched  in Canada  if you want to buy bitcoin peer to peer.  It takes about 5 minutes to setup a secure account and then you're good to go. 
It marketplace is in beta but is working great. The wallet has been working flawlessly since 2015.

I could probably sweep the bitcoin no problem...It is a WIF format. Im now working with this to see if I can do it.

Cancoin.co is also P2P and there are some buyers in the US looking for coin. Secure escrow and encrypted chat.
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:56:57
Coinomi only supports BIP38 and WIF of which none are included in the software that comes with that tutorial. so still stuck. DO you know if Blockchain.info is going to split coins for users?

If you are not 10X better then your competition maybe your time is better spent ensuring that you know who your competition is so that you may blow them out of the water.

no. I was scanning the qr code. no mistake
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:37:39
Cancoin.co is already doing this. Already doing p2p bitcoin trades with escrow and soon to add altcoin p2p trading as well. It will be the safest and best way to exchange large amounts of ALTS.

If in Canada or States you could try the sellers on  Same deal as LBC, they may have to verify a direct deposit to their bank account before releasing escrow but much faster than other xchanges.
