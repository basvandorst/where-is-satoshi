I mean sure BTC prices are hard to predict but saying it’s like a coin flip and completely random is also ridiculous. People make money trading BTC on short movements, so there is some logic to its behavior. It’s clearly volatile but it’s not as if it’s $20k yesterday and $2k today and then $50k the next.

Care to predict when these currencies will be worthless? 100 years? 200 years? Monetary crises happen all the time and yet these same currencies exist. So some countries are repatriating gold bars—-that means all currencies will implode next month, right? ;-)

The biggest risk is something better coming along. That being said, there’s enormous value in being the first or one of the first to market.

Duh. Yet people still use charts (which is using past performance to predict future results) to analyze everything from commodities to stocks to currencies, etc. Past performance doesn’t guarantee anything but it does give you better odds.

Well are you going to provide an argument or not?
@_date: 2019-11-28 02:31:11
Apples to oranges. Again, there’s great value in being an established player in a network technology. Look at facebook for instance. It is entrenched and it will be very difficult for new social media companies to dethrone it because people are simply used to using facebook. It would take a massively better social network to make a run at facebook, but then all facebook needs to do is make small changes to copy that new competitor and therefore easily nullifying any hope of them taking share (think facebook vs snapchat for example).

Well, not really. There is overlap but banks will always have a place because they loan out money for businesses, consumers, etc. Two different animals.
@_date: 2019-11-28 02:24:57
Exactly. That analogy is silly because with a blockchain currency, the longer its around the harder it is to hack and also the greater the network and network values with adoption. Also since it is a financial instrument, there will be much greater trust in it because people will realize that BTC has been around for more than 10 years and hasn’t been hacked yet.

It wasn’t supposed to be a brag about how rich I am. It was supposed to indicate that there is no financial motivation behind my argument, rather the opposite. Since I am invested in BTC, you can’t write off my argument as easily. Of course you interpreted it incorrectly as the dumbass that you are.

No. It is not pegged to oil. I know that you are referring to the petrodollar relationship. Trust me I’ve seen and read all the crazy theories. Doesn’t make it true. The dollar is not officially pegged to anything. Do your research and don’t just parrot what you see on Youtube.

I probably have more invested in BTC than you do. 
That being said, this sub is full of people who are delusional and uneducated.
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:36:10
Well, isn’t most currency based on ‘nothing’? Is BTC based on anything? Is BTC pegged to gold or some physical commodity? NO. At least the USD is backed by the force of the US military.
A deflationary currency is bad for the economy. If your cash gains in value by doing nothing, do you have an incentive to go out and invest in new technology in order to get a better return when there is risk involved? If your currency increases in value,  do you have an incentive to buy a new tv or phone if you know it will be cheaper next month? THIS is why the USD is intentionally inflated. It is not some conspiracy. It is LITERALLY the mandate of the Fed Reserve since it’s conception to target 1-2% inflation each year LOL!! 
That being said, I own thousands of dollars in BTC. That is the asset class I am MOST heavily invested in. Here the crazy thing: I can be invested in something without being delusional about it.

Not even worth explaining. Unfortunately most people in this sub have little motivation to learn about basic economics, they are happy with their “thin air, financial system is insolvent” pipe dreams. Nuance and subtlety are wasted here.

Okay fair point. But one could argue that debt within reason is necessary for growth. 
Let’s say you have an amazing business idea, but you are an average joe and cannot make your idea into reality because you lack the funds to buy equipment, capital, etc. Well you go to the bank and take out a loan and eventually pay it off if and when your business grows. Look at Amazon. It ran huge debt for YEARS but now is one of the largest and most successful companies in the world. Debt is not the enemy. Just like a hammer it is a tool. You can use a hammer to kill someone or to fix your house. It all depends on the way you use it.

Yes. And that’s literally the goal. The Fed wants there to be 1-2% inflation each year. The USD is SUPPOSED to lose value over time, but that won’t stop these idiotic posts. As an owner of BTC I know that there is a difference between a good store of value vs. a good currency. BTC is a horrible currency but great store of value. The opposite is true of the USD. Apples vs oranges.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:06:10
I strongly disagree that BTC is only valuable because it might be the “world’s currency”.  The nature of blockchain prohibits fast transactions. BTC can handle at most less than a dozen transactions per second compared to credit cards which can process tens of THOUSANDS of transactions per second. Unless there is a technical change in BTC is will never be a world currency. Let me ask you this: why is gold valuable? Is it because people will carry around nuggets of gold eventually to use as a currency? Of course not. Gold like BTC is valuable because it is a store of value, because there is a limited supply of both and because people agree that it is valuable. Currency and Store of value are two different things. If you want to learn more I suggest reading the book ‘bitcoin: bubble or revolution’ to get a better understanding.

Can someone pls explain to me how btc will ever become a world currency? Is there even bandwidth for that many transactions?
@_date: 2019-09-26 23:45:40
A medium of exchange for every day expense. I would use it to buy milk and eggs. Not for investment purposes.
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:19:35
Just like BTC and just like pretty much every other currency. Inflation is baked into the system and is engineered to keep the economy moving forward by forcing people to invest. Not sure why this is such a hard concept for this sub to understand. I OWN btc and believe in it as a store of value, however I also think that bashing the us dollar because it serves a very different purpose is a bit retarded. It’s like saying apples are stupid because they aren’t pears.

You are making strawmen and fist fighting them. I hope you have fun with that.
I never said that being rare is the ONLY aspect that makes gold and BTC valuable. That is idiotic and it goes without explanation. Or at least I thought it goes without explanation. HOWEVER being rare IS a required component of something being valuable. Also your dogpoop “analogy” makes zero sense because there is plenty of dog poop in the world. That being said, I once again disagree with you that BTC is valued as it is because somehow people think it will be a currency in the future. I think most people, at least sophisticated, investors understand it to be a store of value LIKE gold. It make NO difference if there is a perceived value of BTC like gold has for its industrial uses. That is not a requirement for a store of value my friend. Societies have used large boulders in the past as stores of value even if they didn’t have industrial uses. Again, I would suggest researching historic stores of values across different societies and you will see that they do not require being useful in any sense.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:50:17
Btc would never make a good currency. Btc is deflationary and cannot handle many transactions without melting down and incurring large transaction fees. You really need to do research and see for yourself. If you really think BTC is going to be the world’s currency then you don’t know much about blockchain technology.
@_date: 2019-09-23 05:09:55
It’s almost as if the Federal Reserve intended for there to be a low level of inflation to spur economic growth.
