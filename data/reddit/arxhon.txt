I live in Alberta. I always thought "alberta beef" was marketing hype. Once I went to the states and had a burger. It had this odd flavor and horrifying mealy texture.

The FAQ for electrum actually says it supports sending to  multisig addresses, and I read somewhere it will create them with a "custom plugin", but there's no documentation for that.
Anyway, I'll look at bit address. Thanks!

No, i understand that. My qquestion is why did the transaction date change instead  of  the transaction failing out.  Anyway,  I'm  not sure  what yyou mean by "sweep the change".  Could you unpack that a little bit?

You're right, I should have included the first sentence. As for the rest, none of it is relevant to the purposes of what a "sale" is.
A sale is "a transfer of an item or multiple items between one party and a second party in exchange for an item or multiple items". Those "items" could be cars, time, labor, bitcoin miners, currency, goats, people, whatever, doesn't matter. As far as the customer, the vendor and the courts are concerned, any time you exchange items it's a sale. This is the most fundamental concept of business: "You have something i want, and I'll you offer something else for it."
I could take the thing and smash it into little pieces, and it won't affect anything about the fact that they transferred me the item in exchange for American dollars as far as a "sale" goes. Sure, I would be unable to provide feedback on it's performance, but that's not relevant to the actual exchange. Well, maybe i could say "it smashed real nice once I took the ballpeen to it". 
Will they give me one if I don't give them anything in return? No. It's a sale.
They are selling the things, no matter how they try to wiggle around it.
You need to wonder why someone is trying to weasel around the most basic concept of business with words.

Here's what i would do about the mining:
I would capitalize the mining rig, and write it off as computer equipment. Utilities, internet, all that would be expenses. You would record capital gains as you sold bitcoins.

I'm a public practice accountant in Canada, and I do personal and corporate taxes for a living.
Here's the "In English" version of what they're saying.
*Barter transactions*
 Basically, if you perform a service or sell a good for BTC, it's treated as the "regular" kind of income (business income or a capital gain, depending on the kind of transaction) and the BTC are valued in CAD at the time of the transaction.
*Purchase and sale as a commodity* 
If you buy or sell BTC for fiat, it's treated the same as buying and selling shares (i.e. you report a capital gain when you exchange the BTC into fiat).
I'd go into examples to illustrate, but i just got back from Ender's game so it's late and i am le tired.
edit: moving words around for clarity
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:02:47


You don't compute gains on a purchase. You only compute gains on a sale. Record the actual cost of the btc in CAD for later.
When you turn BTC back into CAD, your record the difference on a per unit basis.
I bought 1 BTC at $5 last year, giving it an adjusted cost base of $5. In 2013, I sold it for $105 (my proceeds). To figure out my gain, I take the difference between my adjusted cost base and my proceeds ($100) and report that as capital gains.


They don't care. They only care when you turn the BTC back into a "real world" currency, and then that currency is converted to CAD (usually at an average rate because specifically converting each transaction at a spot rate is a lot of work).


Unused capital losses can be held and carried forward or back three years.


The value is still what you paid in CAD. This "Adjusted Cost Base" carries with the item on an averaged per unit basis until it is disposed of in a "real world" currency, and then concerted to CAD for capital gains.


Adjusted cost base, again.


Pure capital gains when you sell your bitcoins for real world currency.
There's no loopholes here (well, capital gains tax treatment is pretty nice). I fully expected CRA to treat btc as capital gains (and business income as business income). 


This is just a clarification of the treatment of bitcoin related transactions. Like i said, i fully expected these decisions, and it seems others have as well.
That being said, I'm right with you on taxes, so I'd actually like to hear your thoughts on payroll tax reform. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 03:42:25
Capital gains is actually pretty favorable in Canada.
Only half of your net capital gains is taxable as income, and you can carry losses forward and backwards by three years each way, as well.

I believe you meant to say 'buy gold bullion with BTC" (otherwise your question doesn't make sense, sorry to be "that guy").
You would consider each transaction as it occurs, since no transactions can occur simultaneously. Refer to my other post[here]( for discussion about ACB, since you're going to need it for the second and third transactions.
The biggest thing to keep in mind is that it appears CRA doesn't consider BTC to be "money", but a "thing". 
Since it's easier to talk about actual things and numbers, I'll say you're operating as a business, and you're selling really fancy custom cakes for the equivalent of $100 in BTC.
Each cake costs you $40 CAD in labor and materials to make. You would record these amounts as normal (wages, materials, and so on). 
Let's say that when you sell the cake, BTC are $100 each. You would record the sale as $100 CAD, and your $40 expenses on the cake would reduce your income on the cake to $60 CAD of net business income. You would pay tax on $60 of net business income here.
You now have 1 BTC, with an ACB of $100.
Let's say the price of BTC goes up to $120 when you exchange the BTC for one tenth of an ounce of gold. 
This one is a little tricky, but since these are both commodity items that would generate capital gains when you sell them, you would treat the $20 profit on the exchange as a capital gain as part of the barter transaction (ACB of the original BTC minus the proceeds of $120 when you exchange), and pay tax on $20 of capital gains here. You now have one tenth ounce of gold with an ACB of $120.
Then when you sell the gold for, let's say, $150 CAD, your profit of $30 would be a capital gain, and again, you would pay taxes on capital gains.
If you're just an individual who is, say, just selling some off some stuff you own such as your Xbox and games to someone on Craigslist, and otherwise not operating as a business, the first transaction is slightly different. Instead, it's treated as "personal use property", and in practice follows the capital gains/losses rules. 
In practice, nobody really bothers with the personal use property rules since you tend to lose money on these kinds of things (you paid $400 for your Xbox and sold it for $100), and the rules say "if the amount of money involved is less than $1,000 don't worry about it" anyway. 
You would have 1 BTC with an ACB of $100, and all the following transactions would be treated the same.
Edit: updates to show the points where you would pay taxes and the kind of income.

*clinks tims*
The movie was pretty good, I thought. 
You never claim a loss or a gain when you *purchase* BTC, only when you *sell*. This is a common mistake made by people.
The cost of the BTC is called Adjusted Cost Base (ACB). It's the average cost per unit of BTC (or shares or whatever). 
You apply the cost of the purchase against the amount you receive (proceeds) when you sell the BTC. The difference is your capital gain. 
If you buy more BTC, then the cost of those new BTC is added to the cost of the BTC you currently hold, and averaged across the number of units sold when you sell.
Clear as mud?
It's actually pretty straightforward, and easier to understand if i walk you through a timeline with made up BTC values.
On January 1, 2013 you buy 10 BTC for $1,000 CAD.  The ACB for your BTC is $1,000 ($100 per BTC).
On March 1, 2013 you sell 5 of your BTC for $110 each, for a total  proceeds of $550. The ACB of those 5 BTC is $500. You subtract your $500 ACB from the $550 in proceeds for a capital gain of $50. As you still hold 5 BTC, you still have $500 in ACB on those BTC to apply to further sales.
On June 1, 2013, you buy another 5 BTC, for $150 each, adding $750 to your ACB. In other words, you have now paid $1,250 for the 10 BTC you have in your possession. The average cost of each BTC is now $125.
On November 1, 2013, you sell 5 BTC for $200 each, for a total proceeds of $1,000. As the average cost of your 5 BTC is $625  ($125 per BTC), your gain is ($1,000-$625) $325.
At the year end when you do your taxes, your total proceeds on BTC during the year are $1,500. The ACB of the BTC you sold is $1,125, your total capital gain is $375, and the ACB of the BTC you still hold is $625 (5 BTC at $125). The ACB of these BTC has no tax effect, because you haven't sold them yet. If you buy more in 2014, then you add the ACB of those BTC to your holdings. 
edit to add: you would report a gain or loss on every sale of BTC.
Does that help?

Canadian tax accountant here:
Capital losses can be carried forward or backwards three years, or held onto until they expire (basically another three years).
Bascially, if you lose $1,000 this year, it sits there in your tax account until next year. Next year, you make $3,000 off your bitcoins. You can take that $1,000 loss from last year and apply it to the bitcoin income in the new year, for capital gains of $2,000.

No worries, dude, it's a good find, and it should be brought to the attention to the community so it can be given the scrutiny it needs.
Indiegogo is really just a go-between for the RioMiner guys and people who want to support the project. Otherwise, they stay pretty hands-off, other than getting their cut of funds raised and maybe chasing scammers after the fact.
The text we've been quoting back and forth isn't from Indiegogo, it's from the RioMiner guy. 
Carry on being your awesome self!

Any time you see "We aren't selling anything. You give us money, and we give you something to keep as your possession, but it's not actually a sale of any sort" it's a pretty safe assumption that someone is trying to run a scam.

Interesting concept.
I'm going to ask some questions to further explore.
How much would you be willing to pay for "fire insurance"?
Would there be multiple fire departments, one for each insurance company? Or would there be one fire department? How would that work?
What's to prevent one insurance company from buying up or otherwise forcing out the local competition and charging $300 a month for fire insurance?
Your best friend doesn't pay his fire insurance. Someone firebombs his house while his family is asleep, and his house burns to the ground with them in it. The fire department didn't respond because of the lack of insurance. What happens now?
@_date: 2013-04-28 05:24:01
Thank you for your reasoned response, instead of flying off the handle!

Yeah, superficial losses complicate the issue beyond what I felt was a reasonably succinct explanation.
Good to see a few other people around these parts know their way around a tax return.
