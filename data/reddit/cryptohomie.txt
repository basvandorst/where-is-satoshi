Thank you, dude. I can barely even stand to read this subreddit anymore. Just a bunch of impatient people panicking. Seems like hardly anyone has a real vision for bitcoin/crypto in here. Glad to see someone else who does.

You raise a great question. I was very skeptical of altcoins before I started researching them.  Personally, I do think some are undervalued but there are so many that seems promising. I think it’s a great strategy for businesses to do this too. It’s almost like they’re issuing stock to gain capital for start up. It’s hard for me to say they’re overvalued when I look at the long term possibilities, these coins can really disrupt the markets we have today. I agree that it’s hard to keep track of all the coins out there, but the majority are created to serve a purpose, so it makes sense that a company wants to tailor a cryptocurrency to their specific use case for the biggest effect. Now that we’re starting to come out with universal wallets it won’t matter as much about keeping track of them. It might just become the norm to have and use multiple cryptos regularly. Imagine having 10-20 bank accounts in the same app, each dedicated to a certain activity like travel, food, entertainment, savings, etc. Could be a great way to budget and organize your finances.

It’s okay, we’ll be fine without you!
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:26:24
To each their own. I’m just more comfortable with having that money in crypto. I have a few grand in the bank but yeah like 98% of my wealth is in crypto. Bitcoin is fairly liquid anyway, so if there’s anything I need that I can’t pay for with it, I can just sell some. Anyway, you’re wrong from the beginning to assume I’m in this for the money. I mainly enjoy the freedom of it and like being a part of the system that will bring prosperity and security to developing nations, rather than the one that takes advantage of its people. I just hope bitcoin keeps performing well so I can give more to the less fortunate.

The stock market has little to nothing to do with Trump. That’s almost like saying he made the price of bitcoin go up... and oh great he gives tax cuts to his rich buddies and is trying to revive manufacturing and coal jobs which are becoming more and more obsolete every day because of automation and alternate energy. This man is not a forward thinker. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:05:13
Stop checking price so much and relax. If you noobies can’t do that then you should leave the market. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:37:15
Nah I don’t  cash out! Haha
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:34:53
Nooo lmao, look at today! Be present and enjoy the life you’re living right now :)
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:28:17
Guess we’ll see won’t we!
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:34:26
I get why you might think that but I’m a pretty normal guy. I’m 23. I skateboard, surf a little, paint, and have a clothing business I’m working on. It’s really not such a crazy thing to do when you believe in this tech and know how to use it safely. I wouldn’t exactly suggest investing to the extend I have, but If you believe in something then you should dive into it. Past performance obviously doesn’t indicate the future but when you see the long term vision and all the good crypto can bring this world, especially in less established countries, the swings don’t bother you. Bitcoin helps you realize money isn’t that important. I hold because I want as much bitcoin as I can so I can do something good with it down the road and really help some people. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:03:34
Pretty sure you’ve got it backwards, buddy...
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:38:40
Yeah I see your point about the far left praising Obama too, but it still doesn't mean it's right. I agree that there will still be manufacturing jobs. However, it seems like Trump wants to prop up that fading industry to make it keep doing the same instead of putting the money into innovation and training these people to do those programming and technical jobs. If our country took energy seriously I bet they could do it in less than 20 years. This may be tinfoil hat territory, but I feel like the alt energy industry is being seriously suppressed by some powerful forces in this country.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:17:50
Faith and “desperate hope” are very different my friend. Also, I’ll say it for the 1000th time... not investing more than what you’re comfortable with is how we stay calm. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:54:56
Yeah I was gonna say I do have like all my money in crypto and I'm still chillin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:15:19
Thanks! I already cashed out my initial investment, so there's not too much to worry about. I was actually just about to cash out a few coins and diversify with traditional retirement savings, but it looks like I'll be holding a little longer. Of course I'm not thrilled with the price drop, but I've been a part of this community for a few years now and this seems far from unordinary. Besides, I'm hooked on the tech alone. Exciting times!
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:15:38
Just because they’re young doesn’t mean they’re wrong about it. I don’t really see the point you’re making. People who have been here a while will try to tell everyone these kinds of swings are normal but everyone still panics. I try to give advice because I have done well with crypto too when I can. I think I can speak for a lot of us when I say It’s not for our personal gain. We want to help the community and guide others on how to invest and holding through dips has been absolutely successful and will be for years to come as long as no apocalyptic events happen in the crypto world. All we’ve had so far is a few rainy days is all. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 05:54:28
Lol. 100% savings in crypto for the last 3 years. Oh yeah I totally regret it...
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:05:24
That’s the great thing, you can choose whichever ones you want to have. If it’s not for you then you can just stick to a general payment crypto. However, I think there will be big incentives to use a dedicated coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:00:01
$150k. Not bad for a 23 y.o.
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:54:11
I have a job that provides me all I need in those respects. I have faith in myself and my skills to keep myself clothed, fed and sheltered. Of course I know money is essential for that sort of stuff but anything beyond necessity is just luxury. And I don’t need much. I don’t attach myself to material things. People these days are so obsessed with acquiring and base their value as a person on that kind of stuff and it’s just so wrong. Bitcoin and other crypto stand for so much more than possession. They’re about returning the power to the people and helping everyone have access to these necessities, especially in undeveloped countries. At this point I’m just gathering what bitcoin I can, so all you people can’t just blow it on lambos and other worthless shit. You can call it gambling but it’s really so far from it. People like me are changing the world. I’m contributing to this movement instead of just trying to leech off of it. I get people have families and stuff they don’t want to put at risk though so I’m not saying everyone should put all their savings in it, but I’m free dude. I’ll be just fine. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:44:08
You make some good points, but maybe I’m choosing to live a life of less stress and to embrace the lifestyle because it aligns with my beliefs. I’m not going to freak out every time the price dips. I’m comfortable with the risk of loss I am facing. I don’t give a fuck if my holdings get cut in half. I don’t give a fuck if I get rich. I can make money without it. I’m not going to try to suck every penny I can out of it when I want to see a healthy growth and adoption of the technology. Shit at this point I should hold just to make sure the coin stays in good hands. It seems all this community cares about is money anymore. I am a true user of bitcoin and stand for what it represents. Might sound cheesy, but it is one of my passions and feels right to me. Living this way isn’t for everyone, but it’s good with me. If my total holdings go down to $20k then sure I’ll cash out if that makes you feel better. You don’t have to worry about me though! I do however appreciate the advice and concern. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:05:20
Man, why is it that all you people care about is money. I started trading crypto this month for fun with no experience and it’s easy as shit to make money that way too, don’t try to make it sound like this is hard. Bitcoin stands for something much bigger than making money. Sure you can call me a moron, but if that’s all you or anyone else see out of this technology then I think you are the one with some serious learning to do. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:55:42
I get the food/shelter aspect, but happiness comes from within, not external things or people. You can still be happy without material things or family. Even some people in poor health or that are homeless have great attitudes. I have a lot of work to do in this area too, but try to realize if you’re relying on those things to make you happy you’re probably missing a deeper happiness that can only come from yourself. Learning this about myself has helped me become a better person and find what is really important. Money can give you some basic comforts, but it will never make you truly happy. You have to try to find who you are without depending on any of that stuff for your happiness. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:31:44
I'm still sort of trying to find it but I will!
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:41:31
Thanks! Yeah I’ll definitely be hodling a good amount still. I just need a little balance at this point. Best of luck to you too!
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:05:20
Agree to disagree, I guess. Best of luck to you.
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:22:55
I’m as hopeful as anyone that it goes up in value but it seems like nobody paid attention during the last bull run so I want to try to warm people of the alternate scenario. This does not feel like we’re switching to a bull market yet as much as I’d like it to. Long term looks great but personally I think we still have some shit to get through. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:18:07
It’s a network. The users support the system by choice. There is no top or bottom, everyone has an equal chance to be a part of it. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:10:34
I’m feeling 6k again
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:05:45
I think you’re right. I don’t see it breaking 8.5/8.6k easily, if at all. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:47:05
My bad I think I mistook you for the op. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:40:50
Exactly. I would expect in normal circumstances bitcoin would move inversely. Maybe there are larger forces at play this time. Could also just be an unlikely coincidence too!
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:57:42
No problem. I know things don’t look good now, but be patient. Good things will come your way. Similar crashes have happened before and it’s likely it will be getter. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:23:50
No, it isn’t likely to go to $7tril haha. I wasn’t saying anything like that. I’m not thinking of the past and I advise you not to do that either, as we can’t change that. I’m saying right now in this moment we all have the same opportunity to see whatever gains (or losses to be fair) that bitcoin has to offer. I’m not saying everyone can be a millionaire, but there’s a good chance that it’ll increase enough to significantly help many people overcome their financial troubles. Plus, there are still other cryptocurrencies coming out each day that have potential for higher percentage gains. Just have to start doing your research instead of spending all of your time being negative on the internet. 
Edit- I also disagree that there is more risk now. The bitcoin network has been tested and strengthened for years now. It has proven itself as functional. I’m not sure where you’re getting that there is more risk now. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:32:24
Lmao no your coins cannot go into negative values if that’s what you’re asking..
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:38:47
I think he’s just quoting the Kendrick Lamar song “Humble”. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:15:22
Oh dang that’s my bad then I thought they did! Thanks for correcting me. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:28:32
They do! You can buy fractions of bitcoin. It doesn’t matter whether you put $100 or $1mil dollars into it. If the price of bitcoin doubles, your investment doubles. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:57:12
All these “finance professionals” who come in and think they understand bitcoin make me laugh. Nobody is stopping you from leaving. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:26:40
Care to bet the value of 1btc 10 years from now on that comment?
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:44:07
Bitcoin is much more important than a game. People are relying on it to create lives for themselves and support their families. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:39:16
Dude you’re doing the same thing though! Of course looking back you can say if we sold then we’d be better off but nobody knew for sure that was the top. And now, nobody knows where the bottom will be. It could break ath in two days for all we know so maybe selling at 20k wasn’t the best idea. (Not that I think that will happen but you get what I mean)
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:03:09
Well yeah, but you still had the same opportunity to invest as they did when they bought years ago too. Maybe if you researched more and kept up on events you would've too. You can keep making excuses all you want, but even a 100% increase is great, so I don't know what you're complaining about. You greedy people are really missing the purpose of this new technology, anyway. And that's probably why you won't make any money in cryptocurrency. I'm going to stop wasting my time trying to help people understand that there is still a great opportunity in front of us because you people just don't get it. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:24:34
Maybe that explains why I’ve never had problems buying crypto using BoA. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:39:56
Just the fuckin’ way she goes. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:46:40
I mean as much as any of us do I guess. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:17:05
I am not one one of those people. I've been with bitcoin for about 4 years now watching the good things it can do for the world. Bitcoin already helped me create financial stability for myself, basically for the rest of my life. Now' I'm trying to get people to realize that this is about so much more than money. I'm mostly talking about the people in countries such as Venezuela who are suffering from hyperinflation. It can protect them from government control as well. Also, those in Africa who do not have access to any sort of banking other than bitcoin can benefit. Choosing to participate in the bitcoin network is choosing to support the less fortunate. I will gladly take some losses once in a while if it means assisting those people.
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:35:46
I bought in 2014 lol
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:36:06
Tax returns!
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:29:34
Yeah either that or desperation I guess. Remember all the countries where people don’t have access to any banking at all though too. I think people underestimate the effect adoption in those places will have. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:02:12
It’s a bit troubling. I wouldn’t be surprised if we went back down to $6k levels. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:20:47
I mean he said this year.. it’s not unthinkable. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:39:52
Ehh speak for yourself there lol 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:04:03
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:38:40
The second thing! You’re right, that was an easy choice. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:15:07
Absolutely agree. Bitcoin has so much potential to do good for the less fortunate. If it fails then the world is in trouble. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:24:28
Not if you’re patient. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:12:15
I've used their app for a few months now! They use segwit and seem like a pretty solid company, but I don't have much else to back that up with otherwise.
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:08:50
No, look at the day chart. There’s a very real possibility we’re dude for a larger correction back down to 5k-6k. Everyone is getting overly hopefully again and you guys know how that usually turns out..
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:07:37
I have to disagree with this. First, value is created for miners every transaction, no? The cost of sending a transaction amount plus the fee is still worth it for the sender/seller. They value it at a fair price to sell because let’s say they made money off bitcoin already or need the money. The person receiving already decided it was a fair price, so they’re happy too, since it will likely go up in the long run since it is deflationary. All three parties benefit in this scenario, I’m not sure where you see that as zero-sum. Value is being created. If you look at the long term I’m sure the total amount of money made in crypto is greater than the total losses suffered, right? I’d appreciate it if you would explain your position. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:59:06
Not at all. There is a difference between inflation and a volatile value. The difference is that bitcoin’s price went up, but it’s purchasing power also went up with it. In these countries you may have a higher number of dollars, but you have no buying power. Bitcoin has countless uses, but protection against government inflation alone gives it a much higher value than it is at now, in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:09:50
You missed my point. You still have the same opportunity and price to buy as a new entrant as someone who has been here longer with more money. It doesn't seem that you even understand the possibilities, or supply and demand even, so I really don't care what you say. I'm not going to waste my time trying to explain this. Enjoy missing the greatest financial opportunity of your life!
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:36:50
I’d recommend a Trezor or a ledger nano s for hardwallets! A little pricey but if you’re serious about crypto it’s well worth it.
