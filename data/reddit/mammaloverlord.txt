Let's put that into numbers and assume he buys all the coin to 12000 at the end price of 12000. So that's 1600x12000=19.2mio. Absolutely affordable for some individuals and certainly for interest groups. 
Now let's play it to the end. YOu just put in 19.2mio and got the price to jump to 12000, that's how you put the machine in motion on one market, that triggers a buying momentum that will make it rise above 12000, say it goes up to 12500, at which point you let it stay for a bit before you sell your coin. That sale triggers a dip to let's say 11500. You made a lot of coin because your movements were always the first ones, you stay ahead of the game, you make the game. I think it's absolutely possible, frankly. And there are always differences between the exchanges, so there is certainly a ripple effect but all you need is one exchange and the trading book of that exchange.

So basically he presents four arguments, I think rather than jumping to conclusions a proper discussion can help figure out how much truth is in his arguments.
The arguments are the following:
**Value goes up because the tape is being painted**
His argument is that miners sell bitcoin back and forth to increase the price. Could this be pulled off? Don't the exchanges watch out for that kind of thing? I was under the impression that they do. Is there evidence that this is happening? I call bs on that one, but if anyone has more insights please share you knowhow.
**Electric sustainability**
In his view the electricity consumption of bitcoin will make the miners hit a profit and loss wall at which point they would start to increase fees (I know he made the mistake of not being aware that there are already transaction fees). So right now and according to blockchain.infi miners are making good money, but as complexity increases will this continue to be the case? I call it bs because miners are already making good profits, the profits are increasing, and the cost of electricity will continue to sink in the future, and electricity will become more sustainable, pretty much all countries on this planet have passed according legislation.
**Confidence and liquidity argument**
What he is saying is that if Bitcoin looses confidence (or interest, or if the hype dies down) the price will collapse. The facts say that every dip is being caught by the dip buyers, Bitcoin has survived pretty much every possible form of attack on it's confidence and still more and more people are buying it. I call that one plausible but is not going to happen.
**Performance during crisis**
That's an easy one. So Bitcoin has not yet seen a crisis therefore no one knows how it is going to perform during a crisis. Utter bs. Bitcoin emerged as a result to the last major crisis. There will be a run, nothing else.
Voila, let me know what you think.
