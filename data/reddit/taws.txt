If you lost your keys, how are you going to prove you owned those bitcoins in the first place?

If you do it slowly, I really doubt it would raise any suspicion. IRS doesn't go after waiters and they make large cash deposits because of tips.

Just because you paid taxes doesn't mean you did your taxes correctly.

$300 may seem like a big deal to you but it is nothing for other people.

$300 is what some people make in one hour of work.

Not really bad advice. It's free to sell and rebuy on GDAX. To transfer to a wallet, you have to pay transaction fees.

How does bitcoin core gaining in value when it is splitting make any logical sense? You are a fool if you think you will suddenly have more money after this split.

Only works if you keep everything on the exchange. Exchange doesn't know what you did with the crypto if you transfer it out. Not to mention having to keep track of all the forks as well.

Yea, good luck doing your taxes. It's going to take forever if you have many small transactions.

Each time you transfer bitcoin, there is a transaction fee. That transaction fee changes your cost basis.

You are going to have to pay capital gains taxes at some point unless you plan on never selling.

You still need to pay a fee to transfer it back to the exchange to sell. That fee isn't reported by the exchange. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:18:52
You still need to keep track of every transaction to know your cost basis.

So you lost $55. That's nothing.
