Just came back from Best Buy, with my new Nintendo Switch, Ps4 and like 10 games.  Switch will make long distance flights for my looming vacation a lot more enjoyable.  
All paid for with Bitcoin.

BITCOIN IS ON SALE BELOW 17K ATM!

Buy it while it's low, Venezuelans more than anyone can attest to how great Bitcoin is.

I know people who lost millions in the dot com crash.  My grandfather made about 2 million and lost half of it.

Yea this was totally planned behind the scenes by Coinbase, miners, and BCH.  Honestly, this whole "industry" just screams scam.  
Full tilt all over again, on a massive scale.

Not ETH, have you seen that guy?  
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:35:09
Wait what?  You think you missed the dip?  BTC is having a massive last minute x-mas sale.  17k?  I'm taking out a 3rd mortgage on my mother-in-laws house for this opportunity.

Just saw back to back 30 second TV spots on ESPN for "Mastercard Masterpass, the modern way to pay" where they just repeat "masterpass" like 50 times and some actress uses her phone to pay for coffee.  
These banks are shitting their pants over BTC.  BUY NOW.  
BTC has the brand recognition and staying power, no need for the silly repetition.

Coinbase / Cloud mining co.'s are clearly in on this behind the scenes.

You sound like someone who isn't playing with a full deck of cards.  Dumb ass.  Good night.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:39:01
This subreddit desperately needs  "dumbass post" filter.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:35:56
OH FUCK IT'S MONDAY AND THE BANKS ARE OPENING THIS NEVER HAPPENS! EVERYONE **PANIC SELL!**

Hey nice Jeep though, way to let everyone know you love penis inside your mouth.  Blocked.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:07:00
You're right a photo with you wearing a watch in a used jeep is compelling.  Thanks for sharing.
What.  A.  Dumb.  Ass.
Show us your breakfast or coffee next.  Please!
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:35:49
and your ignorance exceeds your knowledge.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:00:41
You put your foot in your mouth multiple times in that thread, I'm not interested in having discourse with you, either.  Bye.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:24:47
Stop talking out of your ass.  Too many people talking out of their ass on this forum.    If you don't know what you're talking about, or are unsure - don't talk about it.

No kidding, how is any smaller ISP supposed to compete with Comcast / Verizons market share?  Please, submerge yourself.

Amazon accounts for nearly 1 of every 3 dollars (it may actually have been 2 of 3, don't remember) spent online  I heard this statistic during that Novogratz Bloomberg interview he gave last week.  
The chances of them adopting Bitcoin as a method of payment are very likely.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:35:56
Are you home schooled?  Or are you naturally retarded?
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:15:59
Too bad so many morons (you) are finding out about bitcoin :(.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:26:08
It's almost as though a major holiday with probably the busiest traveling week occurred a couple days ago.  Where people spend long hours at the dinner table discussing a wide array of topics for a great deal of time while stuffing their face.
I can't quite figure out why there would have been a sudden surge like this.  I am unable to reach a conclusion! :hand on chin emoji:
Try thinking.

You should be sorry for posting dumb ass content to the bitcoin subreddit.  This is what you should be apologizing for.  Please refrain from posting dumb ass content to the bitcoin subreddit in the future.  I know it is a tall ask, just the next time you have the urge to post dumb ass content you think we want to see (we don't want to see the dumb ass content you posted) just resist the urge to post dumb ass content.  
Bitcoin is coming along just fine.  Your dumb ass content isn't helping.  It's cluttering up the frontpage of the bitcoin subreddit with dumb ass content is what it is doing.  I don't know anything about you being doxxed, but I know everything about you posting dumb ass content.
Bacon80dog, over and out!
