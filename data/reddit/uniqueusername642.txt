Enron is today famous for their accounting fraud. They ruined themselves with their own hands. Blackberry got kicked out by smartphones. How about other examples like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple or IBM? Those are successful companies that grew exponentially. Of course some cryptos will get kicked out of the market because of false decisions of the team or outdated technology. But the cryptomarket as a whole is here to stay.

It had a 1.5 year bear market before. But you don't even need to look at Bitcoins history to know that a 60% dump is not a healthy correction in a bull market. That's an indication for a cycle change.

@_date: 2019-07-15 21:17:37
If Bitcoin gets mass adopted then yes a 21 trillion dollar market cap is possible. But there are several factors to be considered. 
First, we most likely won't get there within the next bull cycle. Bitcoin made a 20x from its past high of about 1k in 2013 to 20k in 2017. As Bitcoin gets bigger the potential of percentage growth gets smaller. So Bitcoin doing a 50x jump (20k to 1 million) in this bull cycle is very unlikely. So we are looking at a longer time frame, anywhere between 4 to 20 years. 
This brings us to the second point. We are assuming that Bitcoin stays the leader in the cryptomarket. While there is a lot that supports this idea, we can't possibly know for sure. We are looking at a long time frame and therefore it is pretty much unpredictable. Just because something is currently leading the market does not mean it will stay like that forever. 
Some examples of market leaders that failed: Nokia could not keep up with the smartphone revolution and therefore lost its market share to Apple/Samsung, Taxi companies around the world are getting replaced by Uber because Uber is more convenient and cheaper than Taxis, Kodak that dominated the photography film market went insolvent as it was left behind by the digitalization of cameras, Yahoo, that was once the leading search engine, got completely replaced by the more innovative search engine Google. Those are only a couple of examples.
Of course, Bitcoin could also stay the market leader, but it is important to always have those possibilities in mind.

@_date: 2018-01-16 15:01:45
Because someone who has this strategy will constantly be buying and selling. Not only this time. With such a strategy you will lose out on highs (you will never be able to sell at the highest price) and lose out on lows (you will never be able to buy at the lowest price). And on top of that your money gets eaten up by taxes, fees and you will be living a very stressful life compared to someone who just bought once. There is even a 20 year statistic for the stock market that showed that people who were buying and selling with market movements have made 50% less money than the ones who just bought once. 
@_date: 2019-07-08 00:23:38

@_date: 2019-07-16 20:54:17
Bitcoin has never done a 60% correction in a bull market. If you think that it will go from 14k to 6k, then that would most likely be the end of this bull cycle. Bitcoin always corrects somewhere between 20-40/45% max within bull cycles. I see a 40% correction as more likely, so we are looking at about 8.5k.
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:13:36
Something between 6.5-8.5k is more realistic. A drop to 5k would mean that this would be a 70% correction which is really uncommon in Bitcoin bullmarkets. That's almost such a big correction that many people would not be really sure anymore if it really is a bullmarket cycle. Not saying that it can't happen but the likeliness of 6.5k-8.5k is a lot higher than 5k imo.

@_date: 2019-07-14 19:56:37
Assuming we are in a bull market, Bitcoin's corrections within a bull market range from 20% to 40/45%.  If it corrects more than that then we might not be within a bull cycle anymore. If you're bullish I'd start cost averaging  at about 10k. If Bitcoin is going for a 40% pullback that would put its price at about 8.5k. Anything greater than a 50% pullback might indicate a trend reversal. Take everything I said with a grain of salt as the crypto market is very unpredictable.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:31:07
Now is a great time. Even if it goes further down, it will eventually go up. And if you don‘t invest now and the price goes up, there is a chance that it will not go back down to the current price.

I think you are overestimating how much wealth can make you happy. A house/car and so on are nice things but the more important thing is being able to share them with other people. Imagine if I'd offer you the biggest Mansion, a garage full of exotic cars and your own Island. The only condition is that you'd have to live there on your own. Would you do it? 
When you become rich and you don't already have good family/friends at that point, then you won't be able to make new ones as easily. Now you have to worry about if your new friends actually like you as a person or they are just using you. Money attracts the wrong kind of people. They also won't openly tell you that they only care for your money, so you'll never now until they leave you because you are not paying for the parties anymore. 
And then there will be a lot of people around you that start disliking you because they envy your wealth. They start trying to put you down, criticize you because of what you buy and start looking at everything you do in a negative perspective. It's hard for a rich person to seem nice and down to earth. You have to be double as charismatic and humble when you're rich, so new people do not prejudge you as an arrogant and selfish person that does not deserve the money.
Buying a Lambo or any very exotic sportscar will mostly result in negative social outcomes. People that don't care about money will see you as a bragging egoist while people who only care about your money will be attracted to you. And you don't want to be friends with that kind of people. 
In conclusion, always remember that having a socially successful life is much more important than having a financially successful one. It is certainly nice to have both, but spending your money on luxury products won't improve your social life, which is in my opinion the more important long term goal for a happy life.

So the first thing you should know is that you should never invest more money than you are willing to lose. Cryptocurrencies are a riskier investment than for instance a stock like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon,.. If you want to buy Bitcoin, there are several platforms to do so. The ones that are pretty easy to understand are for example Coinbase, Gemini, Bitpanda. If you want to invest 100 USD I would go for 50 USD in Bitcoin, 25 in Litecoin and 25 in Ethereum. Those may be not the coins that will give you the highest profit, but they are well established as Cryptos and therefore have a relatively low risk (for Cryptos). But again, I am repeating that because it is very important, never invest more than you are ready to lose. I hope I helped a little bit.

Sorry, but if your only argument against my possible bear market rally theory is "You are blind because you are considering lower prices", then I can't take you seriously. 
Btw, I'd love for Bitcoin to go up, as I'm not only financially invested but also believe in its ideology. Calling me a bear only shows how blinded you are by your bias that no one is allowed to predict any negative short term price development for Bitcoin. 
Stay realistic and look at a situation from all angles. Don't become tunnel visioned. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2019-11-21 21:41:47
The bubble theory suggests that Bitcoin has no value and the sole reason it's trading at these prices is speculation. And when speculation hits its peak, the price will only plummet from there and never recover as the "bubble" becomes apparent to everyone. At that point it would be just foolish to put money into a popped bubble. 
Bitcoin has very volatile cycles, so we got accustomed to 80-90% drops. A bubble pop would probably mean a drop of about 98-99%. So if Bitcoin goes below 200 USD again, it will very likely be a bubble that will never see its former highs again.
This is just the "objective" definition of a bubble and does not reflect my opinion.

I don't think that the USD or Bitcoin will exist in 3032. 
Maybe our society finds a more efficient way to live in 1000 years without the need of a monetary system. If humanity still exists in 1000 years, that would mean we've overcome challenges like world hunger, overpopulation, pollution, global warming, extreme poverty and so on. Even wars could not exist in 1000 years as a war with highly advanced weapons would likely destroy large parts of the earth. 
Therefore I think that in 1000 years there will be no monetary system because either we became so advanced and started to think out of the box and had no need for one anymore, or we have destroyed our planet and food is now the new and only currency we know.

"This Tittiecoin is the next Bitcoin."   
"When moon lambo?"   
"Why did Bitcoin fall by 2%!? Is this the end of Bitcoin?"    
"In which coins should I invest my 5 dollars to become a millionaire within 30 days?"

@_date: 2019-08-09 19:53:15
That TA is saying that Bitcoin will have a move of about 700-1000 USD within the next 48-72 hours. As ascending triangle pattern formations tend to continue the short to mid term trend of an asset, Bitcoin has a higher chance of going up when breaking out as we've had been rising in the last days. That would put us at about 12.6 to 12.9k. 
TA cannot predict markets, but it can give you a general idea of probabilities. Saying TA for Bitcoin is bs is certainly wrong. It may not be as reliable as in "traditional" markets, but that's due to Bitcoins high volatility. Once Bitcoins volatility decreases, TA will become more effective as TA studies human psychology and not certain markets. So it applies to every asset that is traded by humans.

Two factor authentication.
If you buy Bitcoin of an exchange make sure you choose an exchange where you can withdraw your Bitcoin like Coinbase/Binance/Kraken..
Then you should get a hardware wallet like the ledger or trezor and secure your Bitcoins there. Nobody will be able to steal them. A ledger nano s goes for about 60-70 USD so it may not be worth it now with your 100 USD but in the future when those 100 USD are worth more, you definitely should consider it.

It's possible.  But such parabolic moves are always followed by long corrections like the one we've just seen. I'd prefer a slower and more stable growth. But it's quite possible that we continue in a parabolic manner over the next months until we hit the 17-20k range and then have another big correction to somewhere between 11-14k. This is just a personal thought and not a prediction.

The problem with such plans is you never know what happens. 
Imagine Bitcoin hits 100k and then it corrects to 90k. You sell. Then it goes down to 70k. You are still waiting to buy in further down. But after that it shoots back up to 90k, then 100k, then 150k. Now you don‘t know what to do. People are already seeing 200k/300k/400k. Fomo in or wait? No, you never FOMO. You decide to wait and spectate Bitcoin going to 200k, 250k and finally topping at 280k. Now the big correction starts. 250k, 200k, 150k, 120k. You want to buy in at 60k. Over the next months Bitcoin goes down to 100k. Buy in at a small loss or wait for further correction? You decide to wait just a bit longer. And suddenly it starts rising again. 120k, 150k. You are waiting, don‘t FOMO. 160k, 170k, 180k. You had it, this is the next bull run. You buy back in at 180k. 
Now you have halved your Bitcoins because your trading plan went wrong. And I can tell you that the chance of burning yourself is higher than everything running according to your plan.

@_date: 2019-10-18 18:57:21
Nobody laughs at you if you stay objective and realistic. You should describe Bitcoin as a potential new form of financial system that is still in its very beginning. It could become very big one day but it also could fail. At this point in time you're willing to take a risky bet on it as you see its potential.   
If you describe it like that, people will rather listen to you. If you say something like "Bitcoin IS the financial revolution! The dollar IS going to zero!" most people won't take you seriously or even laugh at you which is understandable.
@_date: 2019-10-02 15:31:15
I don't think Bitcoin will get mass adopted until there is a reason like hyperinflation/financial crisis...

As you are comparing Bitcoin to Gold, in the beginning of the last recession Gold went down by 30%. With Bitcoins volatility we could easily see a 70%-80% move to the downside.

You are mixing things up. Gold is not a currency (anymore). It's a store of value. It has had value for several thousands of years, which makes it one of the oldest assets known to mankind. I understand that Bitcoin is superior in some aspects, but gold has a long history to back it up. Something Bitcoin still has to develop.

If someone goes up to you and tells you that you're an idiot for investing in Bitcoin, because it's a scam and you could have used that money for "real" investments, how would you feel? The way that person is expressing his opinion leads to a non-friendly conversation.

If Cryptocurrencies become massively adopted in real life applications this awareness will get even higher. Of course, you have to believe in the blockchain. I invested because I see potential for this technology for the long term. The price always adjusts to the value of something. If you believe in it‘s long term value, you should not bother about it‘s short term price.

We can't be "starting" a bear market. Either this whole rally was a bear market rally and we are still in the 2018/2019 bear market or it is in fact the beginning of the bull cycle. Imo, this is not a suckers rally until we go below 6k again. Until then I still believe we are in a bull market.

I don't care what you think of TA. You are only repeating what other people are saying. And the majority of people on this sub have no idea about investing because Bitcoin was their first and only investment and they were hoping for fast money. I'm long term bullish on Bitcoin but that does not make me ignorant to everything else.

What is the general peoples opinion on the government and on the bolivar? Do they think that the hyperinflation is caused by mistakes by the government or do they think that it's caused by foreign policies like U.S sanctions? 
Do people still have trust in the Bolivar or are people more and more looking into alternatives? 
Do people have free speech in Venezuela or could you get punished if you say something against the government in public? 
Thank you for doing this Ama.

If a Bank sees unusual behavior, they call to make sure that you are aware of the withdrawals and that it was made by you.

And that's why Bitcoin won't reach mass adoption until we have an UI that prevents that

People try to explain things by linking it to news. But I can assure you most of the time it has nothing to do with news. Sometimes yes but most of the time it is just price movements. You should not read more into it than it actually is.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:34:09
I mean Bitcoin is very volatile, we have to deal with those price movements. Even though there are a lot of memes around here if there is any significant news, I'm sure it will get posted. So don't worry too much about sudden price movements. It's just Bitcoin doing Bitcoin things.

We need a much better and safer UI. Without that Bitcoin will never reach mass adoption. People would be losing money left and right due to typos.

You have to understand that in life 0% and 100% don't exist. Even if I believe in Bitcoin that does not mean there is a 0% chance for it to fail. You always diversify and never put all your eggs in one basket.

If we go back to 3k and below this would not be a "bubble". This would be a bear market rally.
@_date: 2019-09-15 23:42:38
To be in the 1% today you only need a net worth of about 750k. So that would price one Bitcoin at about 3 million.
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:19:07
The biggest problem with mass adoption is UI. If I have to send micro transactions before sending the real transaction to make sure I'm not losing all my money it won't get mass adopted.

But he has a point. If you sell something for cash then you have cash. So in reality you had cash all along. Mind blown. /s
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:48:28
If Bitcoin proves itself as a medium of exchange and as a store of value, it will go up a lot more than 2% a year. If not then you're going to lose your money. It's either making 10-1000x or losing everything.
