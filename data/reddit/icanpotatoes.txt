Why does it take so long to deposit USD into GDAX?  I did a transfer two days ago and GDAX is stating that it will be available on the 13th.
Why can't Coinbase credit the user the amount instantly while the antiquated banking system takes its time?
In the days it's taken, I've lost nearly 30% worth of gains.

Lol I’m still waiting for my funds to clear. Day 4 and counting.

I first used coinbase with a small purchase to "test the waters" when it was at $12.4k.  Then I learned of GDAX with the lower fees and better UI and did a larger deposit.
The coinbase one, while bought at that price is still pending and GDAX hasn't cleared the larger transfer. My bank account states the amount is pending so I figure it's the bank taking its time, per usual.

I’m just over here twiddling my thumbs, waiting on the bank deposit transfer I did a couple of days ago, watching the price go up and up and seeing my small amount to deposit to become worth less and less. Sigh.

I've decided to use GDAX instead to avoid fees.  Though the authorisation section for taking photos of ID isn't working. My guess is the volume of people signing up.

Not really. I’ve been waiting on $500 to clear for the past 3 days in order to buy what I could comfortably afford, and the price has gone from 10k to 19k back to 16k and I feel like I’m missing out on serious ROI as my $500 becomes less and less valuable as the price surges up.
It’s cool that other people are making a lot of money, though. Lol

I’m wanting to invest into Bitcoin. I’ve known of it since the beginning but I simply never invested (my friend did though when it was $25).
I’m using Coinbase and while the ticker shows $11,800’s, when I go to buy it shows that I’m buying at $11,909.20.  I checked other tickers and they all have $11.8k.
Is this a glitch on Coinbase’s end?

I am curious how this sort of scenario plays out on the bank’s end.
Let’s say a college student like myself happened to be an early adopter, and cashed out with a couple hundred thousand in USD.  Wouldn’t transferring that amount to a bank account that has never had more than $4k throw a lot of red flags?

On GDAX, I have to wait for the transfer to complete before using funds, so both of my transfers are in pending and have been for nearly 3 days now. Should have just used Coinbase and bit the bullet on their fees.
