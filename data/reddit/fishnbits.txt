What if Russia invaded the U.S. after America deteriorates due to famine and a collapsed monetary system?

Say, in 50-100 years, global warming leads to crops not producing enough for the growing population. This can be enhanced with new technologies to alter wind and weather. Perhaps in this time, The U.S. has exhausted its resources from constant war, loses its reserve currency status and deteriorates, leaving the country weakened.

Calm down. When a coin is worth $100,000 you will look like a prophet.

Well, right now millennials are too young to invest. However, they are actually the age group that would be the most open to the idea of digital money. When they start to become financially independent (10 years maybe), bitcoin will have much more functionality and be easier to use. It will have been around since they were kids. They will trust it more than other age groups.

I'm saying it will be successful before 10 years. It's successful now! But world wide adoption will begin with millennials and create something greater than mere success - total domination.

this is a long term idea buddy

Don't you think that people who grow up with unrestricted access to ideas and information (internet) will create a society to reflect that? How about people who are also raised by parents who grew up with unrestricted access to ideas and information? How about people growing up in a world where everyone was born with unrestricted access to ideas and information?

what was the guy in the beginning saying about how Dimon thought the government would use bitcoin t3chn9logy to create a shadow economy?

if energy is free, we won't need bitcoin
@_date: 2015-11-06 23:50:55
in 100 years, when bitcoins run out, technology will have changed so much that discussions now about how to deal with it will likely be irrelevant. For example, some form of free energy. or costless computing. anyone can verify transactions at no cost to themselves.

bitcoins don't run out for 100 years. we don't need to worry about fee only mining right now.

he says that you should invest in gold and bitcoin

He mentions it in a 2012 commencement address at UCLA:
"...you now face a future that will feature either another great recession during your 20s or during your 40s, a US debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 200%, and that’s not me, that is the Congressional Budget Office. Me, I think they are ignoring reflexivity and I think you face both. Now Greece was at 160% debt-to-GDP when the last of its dying life started running out. From my perspective this is all the more tragic because the financial meltdown was both predictable and preventable. This was no black swan and no other serendipitous excuse should be acceptable to anyone. Of late Europe’s convulsions are in the news. Even this should not be surprising. Back in 2006 when a bunch of us shorted Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain we called them “the Pigs” for a reason. I can explain it in one sentence: when the entitled elect themselves, the party accelerates, the brutal hangover is inevitable. Californians, and indeed all Americans, ought to take note...
...history has demonstrated the ability of sovereign nations to justify themselves and to postpone the moment of crisis. This will be even more true for the United States as the largest economy by far with the strongest central bank. As a result, over the course of your lives you will experience withering but stealthy attacks on your quality of life as government attempts to manage its faltering finances. You will see declines in the quality of healthcare, the quality of education, the quality of public safety, and the quality of our currency. Of course this is a false prophecy; I am simply describing what is already happening."
