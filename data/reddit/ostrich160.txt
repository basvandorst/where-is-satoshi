Arent bitcoins much harder to mine now though, like you need a really good computer to even come at a chance of getting any?

Unfortunately, I never got that much into it, so I was just mining on my own, but since I never really turned my mac off I just kept it running for weeks, bearing in mind this was back when mining bitcoins was much quicker.

Oh thats an interesting point, if I go onto the address tab on my bitcoin qt, there are no addresses so maybe the wallet didnt important correctly, on my windows machine that is.
As for my mac, it needs to do the whole week sync again, which last time took a few days, but in the address tab, once again theres no addresses at all.

my mac version I updated to 0.8.5
Well, if this doesnt work thanks anyway for your help, its a bit disheartening to think that all my work, or rather my investment of time from the beginning, has gone to waste bit I guess theres little I can do

How do I do that, I tried blockchain but couldnt find out how to actually upload the wallet.dat
Thanks so much for the help so far by the way

I tried on my mac and my PC, got the same error both times-
Unexpected end of file from server
Is this a problem with the file or something else?
