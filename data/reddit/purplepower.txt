Until they are reviewed on safeorscam.com I would be very careful with this one. Its almost to good too be true, and so it probably is. :(
If someone was to copy this model and use PGP for communication and Bitcoin for payment they could really do something good.

Sorry to hear about the paypal problems, I personally hate how paypal can just freeze peoples accounts when you are running a perfectly legal business but I guess thats just another reason why cryptocurrencies are the future. 
You guys accept NXT, bitshares, counterparty, mastercoin doge, but why not VERT?

These rumors are spread with the intention of being able to get cheap coins, IMO. China can see that BTC is a truely revolutionary thing and it wants to get in cheaper. Also the price ALWAYS rebounds after the new is known to be fake. Expect a jump back up like always, the best way for it to go up is to first go down.

its cool to see another 3d printing place in Fargo! I still havent checked out Meld Workshop but they already accept BTC in Fargo, ND. It would be nice to see some Moorhead, MN businesses take BTC since both towns are like one together since they border each other.

It definitely seems that coinbase is under a PR attack now that the coinbase has cleared up the email leak rumor.
@_date: 2014-04-26 02:12:11
This is a joke of bad timing but based on this case I would say coinbase totally DOES have "bank level security".

They are so focused on wanting 1 WHOLE bitcoin the concept of Fungibility goes out the window. if they would just move the fucking decimal over it would all make sense :(
Gold has to have a scientific use much better than just being a shiny commodity to trade.
@_date: 2014-04-01 02:46:59
This is one of the reasons ill be moving my coins off coinbase and putting them into cold storage. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:25:57
Why would you buy a bitcoin with no reason to use it and resell it back while paying for a premium both ways. WTF...
and when he kept saying fungible I cringed, they obviously do not get it.
@_date: 2015-02-15 18:03:48
It is part of the internet and I love the internet, I think the internet and how it revolutionized the entire world is the most under appreciated thing in the last 10000 years possibly. 
Before people that were different from you were considered enemies, now with the internet and education they are friends....(most of the time, if they are not trolls)

Ive REALLY been thinking about this but in the end I think its a bad idea. There is a good change the bitcoin could devalue and they could get really unhappy. They could sell it immediately get normal cash for it, and then IF it does go to the moon they will most likey have a lot of regret for selling. Or they could get really intersted in and love it and get rich and everyone lives happily ever after.
I just think the likelyhood of the receiver of the gift to be upset over the bitcoin somehow in the future very likely with the recent market volatility even though I personally fuckin love the shit out of bitcoin.
If I got my parents or my brother bitcoin I personally think they would not like it. They either dont want to hear about it and think its a fad or a ponzi scheme. 
If the person you know is poor and expressed interest in bitcoin then maybe its a good idea to teach them everything you know and set them up a wallet. If they hold long term and it goes to the moon your gift will be legendary. 
These are my views as a poor white 24 year old living in a low-middle class life.

These are very neat, can you make me some really low value cheap ones? The idea for them to be used as conversation pieces is great I think and I would love to have some myself since I believe in bitcoin wholeheartedly. How much is 1000MBTC in USD?
