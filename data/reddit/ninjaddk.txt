If it’s any consolation fashion watches that you see use Miyota quartz movements. We are using Ronda movements

If you wish we have an instagram with some content. I can pm you if you want it.

Ronda Swiss Quartz. Not a fashion watch from Alibaba my friend

I’ll talk to my board of scientists and get back to ya. But your on to something here.

Black Dial/Silver Detail the picture lighting was a little bit hard on the image.

I think it says “Bitcoin Time” O.o we can’t be for sure though.

I looked at the design of replacing it and chose instead for a watch that was overall functional as a Watch first, spiced with a sentimentality towards Bitcoin. Also, I have tried everything to get as far away from Fashion watches as possible. But the minimalist style is truly captured by such brands. I wanted something simple as opposed to other Bitcoin Watches on the market.

We used the standard leather in the industry. Instead of choosing to cloud the grade of leather in marketing speak we opted to present the consumer the product as is manufactured. However I do respect your opinion and it is understandable why you hold it.

I looked over some documents and the full leather specifications are “Genuine Black Padded Leather with Embossed crocodile grain”. The low price point is deliberate I opted to focus on product selection over high end priced individual pieces. This watch can sell for more however I am utilizing a different pricing strategy for the brand. If this is more accurate in terms of specification please inform me.
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:07:03
The reason for the price tag is due to it not being an alibaba or aliexpress watch. Also more to your point there is no “Swiss” or “Bitcoin” markup on the piece. The glass is a sapphire mineral glass. I believe I have diligently provided authentic information to the prospective consumer. The choice to trust us is solely in your hands my friend. I can only give my word that I am proud to sell this item and I stand by everything I have outlined so far. 
Also totally understand your skepticism well wishes to you!

I don’t quite understand what your asking. But I will attempt to answer, the coloration of the crocodile designed leather paired nicely with the black dial. I do have ambitions to make variants in the future that will have mesh straps. I hope I answered your question.

If only my dude. But it might not look as good as what I got now.
@_date: 2019-09-13 21:05:07
That means so much that you appreciate the design of “Modern” or “Classic” styles pieces. My aim for the brand is to have a price range that’s comfortable for people. Mechanical is definitely tougher and hopefully way down the line. Automatic and Swiss Quartz will be the focus though
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:48:21
Well I just posted my url to my site and I got some downvotes. So I got a little wary but your right. It’s 
@_date: 2019-09-14 12:56:13
As of now No. I apologize however I do have ambitions towards hopefully expanding international. If I shipped as of now people would be getting obscene charges when they receive the product.
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:25:19
Trust me I’ve looked into it. The crown was too small to engrave BTC. I have an design outline for an automatic piece however I wanted to provide a Price tag for people that doesn’t approach $1000+ and have a more modern Design to them. However your on the exact same page as me dude!
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:44:54
THANK YOU FOR THIS! Lots of conversations with my manufacturer and detail specification on prospective pieces. I’ll get that fixed right away!
@_date: 2019-09-14 03:01:26
I know! The lighting is really harsh on the hands in the image. :(
@_date: 2019-09-13 16:02:10
At GenesisWatches.com you can find this piece. My hands are only able to ship to the U.S as of now sadly.
@_date: 2019-09-13 21:35:51
I have a great manufacturer already that are able to provide a wide range of pieces. However you have my sincerest gratitudes for the offer!
