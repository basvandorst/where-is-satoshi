While it's true that block times influence centralization slightly, a lower block time doesn't give any real advantage to miners with higher connection speeds.
Consider MinerCorp, with a gigabit uplink and connections to 500 nodes. All of those nodes will recieve a block within a very short time after it being mined. Litecoin blocks tend to be about 10kB, so very low. All of those nodes will get the block in about .04 seconds minimum. His block gets out there extremely fast.
Now consider JoeMiner. He's got an average uplink of 4mbit/s, and is connected to 8 peers. His MB block takes .16 seconds to propogate to peers. Joe's peers send the block to their peers, of which they will have an average of 8. After 2 propogations (.32 seconds) JoeMiner's block has spread to 512 nodes, essentially tied with MinerCorp. Add in the longer send time and JoeMiner, with a pitiful internet connection, is only .44 seconds behind MinerCorp. A lag of .44 seconds would have a neglegible effect on block orphaning. Even with blocks which are 10x larger, the lag is only 4.4 seconds, still very small, having only a small clumping impact on the network.
Furthermore, the nodes which JoeMiner connects to are host nodes, and so most likely have more than 8 nodes connected, perhaps even as many as MinerCorp. This further speeds the propogation of JoeMiner's blocks, bringing him closer to MinerCorp.
Tl;dr: Block lag is too insignificant to cause any major clumping due to orphaned blocks.

A pool with 51+ mining power (preferably more)  could independently create a chain longer than everyone else, thus invalidating the 49- chain and causing no blocks other than their own to be profitable. 
Obviously this is difficult to do at 51, but as you get up a bit higher it becomes easier and easier. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:21:09


Just noticed this. Larger blocks don't take longer to hash, and the network difficulty would adjust for asics keeping the block time at 2.5 minutes.
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:05:56
My wording probably could have been more clear. Basically, a 1/4 block time doesn't matter because the blocks propagate 4x as fast. (25MB propagates as far in 2.5 minutes as 100MB in 10)
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:24:43
I have never owned any litecoin, nor do I plan to. What you fail to account for is that a litecoin block will be 1/4 the size of a bitcoin block, because the block time 1/4 that of bitcoin. If a 100mb block can get to 10^3 people in 10 minutes, that means in 10/3 minutes it can get to 10. By that logic, a litecoin block can get to 10 in 10/(3*4), and therefore to 10^3 in 3 times that. (10/4 or 2.5 minutes) The block propogation time scales inversely to the block time, and so block time becomes irrelevant to propogation.
Tl;dr: Litecoin has smaller blocks which propogate as fast. (Relative to block time)

Please read my explanation of how block exclusion is possible before you say it's wrong. Just because the reference client mines to the longest chain doesn't mean that a corrupt pool will. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:17:13
Therefore, you can cause other miners blocks to become orphaned, making you the only effective miner. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:22:11
Here's an explanation of what I mean by a 51% attack.
Let's say the latest block is X. Malicious Miner (Let's call them GHash) mines block A onto X. Another miner mines block B onto A. GHash (Which has 51%+ of the mining power) will tend to mine another block. Let's have them mine C onto A, which is totally valid. It may not be taken as the top block, but because they have majority mining power there's a good chance it will be. All other miners are now mining onto C, so long as C is more difficult than B. If it's not, miners will continue to mine onto B, but GHash will keep mining blocks onto C. Eventually, because they have more mining power than the rest of the world combined, they will tend to find blocks faster, and so they will build their chain faster than any competing chain can build.
You need to remember that just because the reference client miens onto the longest chain doesn't mean that GHash has to. They can mine any block chain they want, so long as it traces back to Genesis. If their chain has more difficulty than any competing chain, they are the established chain.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:34:04
As soon as a pool reaches 51+ there's no basically no stopping them, because they can refuse any block outside their pool. No miners outside the pool would profit, and that would drive more people to the pool than would leave for moral reasons.

Middlecoin is mining scrypt coins and then selling them for bitcoins. It is not strengthening the bitcoin network in any way, and is in fact helping to lead to the centralization that scrypt coins are trying to avoid.
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:09:25
It doesn't matter. If you keep building blocks on top of your own blocks you will have the longest chain. Just because reference clients build on the highest difficulty all the time doesn't mean a malicious miner does.

@_date: 2013-08-04 04:10:33
I think that LiteCoin is a lot better for micro transactions.
Honestly, there should be a cryptocurrency with a target block rate of one every few seconds. There's be a lot of orphan blocks, but confirmations would be incredibly swift. Make the coins expire, and you have a great currency to trade proof of work.

Knowing any of the data on the QR code makes it exponentially easier to crack. In this example it is possible to decode for certain around 20-30 bits of that private key. This is still an extremely impossible private key to crack, but given other angles and using the error information on QR codes, this definitely makes it easier.

I'm not quite sure if you're saying this is a good idea or not. Some captchas nowadays are difficult for people to solve, and yet I can get 7 recaptcha solves for a cent, so clearly captcha is not going to be able to protect email now nor in the future.
On the other hand, work is getting cheaper and cheaper. Hopefully as bitcoin matures and work becomes less valuable, things will level out and we won't see supercomputers sending mail.

Too bad the difficulty grows exponentially by nature, so the linear growth doesn't mean jack.
could we PLEASE stop posting anything about difficulty in terms of linear growth? That strategy has basically become a way to sensationalize what is otherwise a perfectly normal growth rate. Also, difficulty charts should be on a log scale, because the data is exponential data. Maybe then people would realize that there is nothing crazy happening to Bitcoin every time someone posts these crazy comments in the hopes that they gain a dollars in their coinbase account.
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:08:57
A little bit more detail might help.
The price is MtGox current price. Buying and selling buys or sells your entire stash at current prices. The "Investment" rate is the number of currently online users who are holding BTC and not USD.
@_date: 2013-08-16 08:10:31
I bought it as well. Coinbase took a bit longer than I would have liked to process the transaction, though. That may just be a problem with it propogating to them, but blockchain.info does a much better job. Maybe coinbase isn't peered with enough people?
@_date: 2013-08-04 17:09:15
A unit of bitcoin can theoretically represent a unit of work. The reason that using bitcoin is better is that it allows people to either create their own proof of work OR to purchase proof of work.
The largest problem with this would definitely be the reliance on bitcoin, which has minimal acceptance. Unfortunately, that problem plagues most all things based on bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:07:45
If the bit coins didn't reach your address they still have them.

Honestly, that wasn't very relevant, and all of the points it brought up were at best barely valid. The system would not be used by everyone nor for all emails. This would be the thing you put on your blog, so you don't get spam. It's not what you use to talk to friends you already know. Furthermore, after first contact the system would function exactly like normal email.

Good point. What if the US Federal Reserve created a new blockchain in which only they could mint coins, but in which they'd trade USD for coins?

1) In the olden days you used to be able to pan for gold with a CPU. Now you have to do deep drilling with an ASIC, which costs tons of money and takes a lot of time to get into. People have created coalitions of miners to make it more fair for everyone and make mining less centralized.
2) Bitcoins can be subdivided down to a 100 millionth of a bitcoin. That means there are 2.1*10^15 units of bitcoin. On the other hand, so far [4.75*10^30 units of gold have been mined.](

That's not a democracy. That's a pseudo-democracy that people have come to be used to today.
Bitcoin is a democracy. The majority gets to decide what blockchain everyone uses, and if you don't use it your fake blockchain is basically worthless.

Bitcoin's value doesn't come from you using it. It comes from everyone else using it. Therefore a bitcoin that only you use it worthless.

That sounds very sarcastic. I don't really trust any of the mainstream media. NBC is a democratic circlejerk, Fox news is a republican circlejerk, and CBS is... somehow off.

Skeptical enough?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:52:26
I've been thinking about these things a lot recently, and Bitcoin is a lot more like gold than it is like Fiat. It's almost as though we are stepping back to a more primative form of currency, while making it more convenient.
* Gold has no central issuer. You can go mine it for yourself
* Gold is basically limited for now
* Gold can essentially be subdivided to infinity. (As much as BTC can)
Because of this, it would be difficult for Bitcoin to become a truly global currency. It may not seem like it, but having a central party which can just issue currency out of thin air can often be good for the economy. Being able to create a temporary easy money environment allows people to take loans without worrying. A deflationary currency like BTC makes loans a very risky business, because your debt is likely to increase in value.
That paragraph was pretty badly written. Whatever, back to watching price charts.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:06:54
The problem with this is that in order to use it the user has to have internet access anyway. The whole idea of having it offline just makes it less convenient.
