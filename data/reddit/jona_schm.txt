Wouldn't it be the best to sell now and buy during the correction/crash (if you started buying this month)?

Sale's over. Get back to work

Well that's a quite stupid thought process because a sinking ship never sunk and a crashing airplane never crashed before. But I agree to you, Bitcoin will survive this enormous dip!

Same here. Cashing out at 20k and then buy the enormous dip

They are such versitile vehicles!

Bitcoin isn't usable as a replacement for fiat currency yet

Doesn't work for me, coinbase isn't verifying me

I don't mean these price fluctuations. Someday it will go down quite a bit, but nobody knows when. Sorry for not being clear enough

Do know anything about the situation in Austria?

I doubt that too

Having your Coins in a exchange account is similar to having gift card credits in your Amazon account. You can use it from there but in case Amazon (your exchange) shuts down or gets hacked you lose it

Hey there, very specific requirements for a new exchange for me. I'm from Europe, can pay via SEPA, PayPal or Sofort. I'll be testing/learning with very very small amounts (broke as student but very keen to learn) so very little fees and transaction fees, preferably percentage based ones, would be good. Easy/fast ID verification would be great, as well as a nice UI. Can anyone help me?
Thank you guys. I'm new on the ride, but keep on hodling!
