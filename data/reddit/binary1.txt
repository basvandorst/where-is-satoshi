From the story:
With bitcoin’s constantly fluctuating value, BitRocket use an average price taken from various exchanges, gathered through BitPay. “When someone puts Australian dollars into our machine, we have to convert those into US dollars so we still have to pay bank fees,” explained Joe, “but effectively you’re only paying a few per cent and have the convenience of buying your bitcoin and being able to walk away straight away.”
They're going to take a cut of some sort, how much is indeed the question. Will post details after a visit later today.

If a free, worldwide teleportation network was present, and you could carry a few tonnes of gold to one, in your pocket, or in your head, then it would likely already be worth a healthy multiple of what it is currently.

For anonymous cash BTC purchases, your choices are limited to a localbitcoin meeting, or an ATM.

Shop's website showing opening hours:  
Google's map appears to be off a bit, have had a pie at that cafe, pretty sure the entrance is on corner of Dunning &amp; Hayes.

Well, time to write a patch or new version then, that's the point...
Scalable difficulty might not be easy to incorporate, but seems the most logical answer, as begging the (now) highly invested miners to not follow the best return (assuming that's why they're there) doesn't seem to be working.

Has been fixed, the 3G dongle inside needed a data recharge.
Smooth sailing after that.

Would seem fairly straightforward.  When a pool gets over 40%, their difficulty goes higher.  End of problem.

Yes they do, and their Newtown cafe will soon as well.

Somone sent that address 0.01 BTC...

Still down, apparently someone is on their way to fix it.

My Google-fu can't find it/them.  Please state location.

There's one here: 
but was out of order last Saturday. Haven't been there for many weeks prior to that.

Not sure which to dislike more, the article, [businessinsider]( or the bank(s).

So you have an Apple device somewhere else you'll be using Coinbase on (now or later), or have you somehow got iOS to run your Samsung?  That would be worthy of a video as well...

Possibly an SMH tasteless headline, but story lifted from the "St Louis Post".  Aside from headline, not complete crap, but cautious to negative overall.

Now I understand the "Always On" gaming paradigm...

The implication is that a team of very talented and dedicated programmers wrote it.  And then kept quiet.
Coming up with the idea is one thing.  Writing "Quality Code" is quite another matter.  For an insight, and an interesting story, see [They write the right stuff](
I may just be underestimating the open source community.  What would interest me is whether the reviewer's comments were on the first released examples of the code, or the current/later version(s).
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:51:05
The "reviewer" I was referring to was the "Professional hacker" - as labelled by the BBC, Dan Kaminsky, interviewed in the report.
I wanted to avoid the term hacker in my previous post.  Was a bit ambiguous, sorry.
Granted I haven't read the code, but am now curious to.  I will look it up and see if I, with my meager skills, recognise alien-like coding ability.

There are additional problems...  The amount of a tip is not worked out prior to visiting a bar/restaurant etc.
Not too many would stock up on vouchers of different value prior to every night out to allow for standard/good/great/OMFG-Outstanding service tip amounts.  And you would have to do so prior to every possible tipping situation, assuming expiry is built in.  Giving a tip that returns to you the next day because your last stocking up on tip vouchers was 28 odd days ago would make you a right prick.
When bitcoin has taken off, one of your server's QR codes (perhaps one unique to you, the customer) could easily be printed on the bill, or one of many other options that allow for direct payment, wallet to wallet.  In fact, the bill would likely have a QR code for the bill amount to go to the establishment, as well as the seperate one for the tip for the server.
Simply asking your server "Do you have a Bitcoin wallet?" will be enough.  The tip can't (without server consent) get pooled in with fiat tips, amongst every other advantage I won't list here.
