Just tried a Credit Card purchase but it failed. Maybe it could be because I just made the account and linked the car, or have not added a bank account? Who knows.

Was not aware you could use a credit card with coinbase, I thought it was through a bank account. I will have to look into it, thanks.

I stick to the &lt;$2 coffee and I still feel like I am spending too much. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 21:54:03
That deserves a tip!

I just can't figure out how to use a cc with them other than as a back up payment source.

It tells you what is being charged before you finalize it. The credit card is a back up encase your bank account has insufficient funds. Did you race through and not read anything?

How old is she out of curiosity?

Do they offer this service in more than the 8 states I am seeing listed on old posts?

I hold a very small % of my portfolio, and I spend when I can find what I want for btc, but that is fairly rare.

I am getting "deposit failed" trying to buy with a US Visa.

Tried but had no interest.

I have bought less than 10 on coinbase recently,
@_date: 2014-09-24 19:54:55
And a little lock box can easily be stolen. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 03:17:03
That's really cool!
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:05:30
I was able to log in and buy.

I think the main draw of circle is ease of purchase with bank accounts and credit cards, doubt anyone half way experienced will be using them as a way to store bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-21 05:15:49
They are advertising it now like it is. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 23:03:34
Don't tell me what to do!

Coinbase has a reoccurring buy option.

Will other units be supported in the app in the future besides just bits? Not that bits are all that confusing but most are now used to the standard 'bitcoins" unit. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 05:06:40
Best thing you can do is look into the sellers feedback to determine if they are reliable. I have bought bitcoin on eBay multiple times with no issues, before coin base and the like were around. It is a ridiculously expensive way to acquire bitcoin though usually.

What bank are you using? I'd tell them to fuck off and get a new account somewhere else.
