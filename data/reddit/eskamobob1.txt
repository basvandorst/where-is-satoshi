Sounds like an awesome idea to me! We just have to make sure to officially submit a request for anarchy while we are at it :P

Haha... Prity sure I saved my bitcoin folder to my encrypted data sector, but I should have any issues locating the file once I crack the encryption again :P... Mainly just making sure the wallet didn't embed its self into the OS as I'm not sure how I would have gone about separating it of it had :P

so basically you want to celebrate the federal reserve with a bunch of people that participate in using a currency that fully circumvents taxes, and everything the federal reserve stands for? :p.... sry.. too tempting :p

Haha... Ok... Was just curious :P... Most other parts of btc are prity secure and backed up, I just didn't know about the wallet :P

KK... Kwl... So I can just open the wallet once I find the file then... My worry was it was somehow locked into the system it's self... Would I be able to transfer the old walet to the new comp by just copy and pasting the entire bitcoin file?

I can get into the HDD easy, I'm just not sure how to access the wallet once I'm in

Very cool Ty... And one last question... It would seem prity easy to me to adjust a walet to contain any number of bitcoins you would like unless the protocols have changed... Is this stopped by the way they are transferred? (Send everything and receive the remainder and then confirm with system)... Just a curious question :)
