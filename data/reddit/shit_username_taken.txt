I feel for you my brother/sister... don't let it get you down, money isn't the key to happiness, it only helps us buy more of what we don't really need. Besides, it's nice to be able to say you got in earlier than most :-p

just bought the book.... didn't read it yet. am a little afraid it might be too technical for me as I am not a Coder. 
I glimpsed inside... and I feel a little daunted

I hope you bought in at that price. hahaha. I remember it being under $300 for ages...and being so broke I decided to mine rather than buy. 
should have bought! 
Give it a year, and I am sure it will be back to 20K+

Thanks for the Recommendations! I will be sure to look them up...
Currently I am reading Blockchain Revolution by Don and Alex Tapascott.
I have been living in China for 14 years....and am currently involved with a new start up company here. working to develop our own Crypto Currency and other applications for the Blockchain. any and all advice is always welcome to a newb like me.

oh I will go back to it... I bought a few blockchain books, will read the more user friendly ones first, haha. then go back to it. Having glanced through the pages, it does look like money well spent. lot's of positive reviews... 
Thanks for the encouragement! 
I tried mining Bitcoin in 2012 when it was still under $300 USD a coin... I had no money to buy then. and regret not borrowing to buy just one coin. never mind. time to catch up and try to learn something about the Blockchain. 
I hope you are holding ;)
