pffft encryption is pretty much useless when it comes to privacy protection.  Most major firmware thanks to global spy agencies is well accepted to be  corrupted and can be back doored to obtain the data BEFORE it is encrypted and AFTER it is decrypted.  If you run your own chips and firmware AND encrypt and the receiving end also runs the same chips and firmware you might be secure.  Otherwise if you want any form of privacy then disconnect from the internet 100%.

This is better than swatting.  "Hello police?  Dude in Apt 34b is Satoshi Nakamoto!" click

I've been thinking about this lately.  Who are the powers that be that will attempt to ban it?  They will be corrupt bankers, politicians, etc.  AND will they wield more influence than the powerful billionaires, politicians and users who embrace it? Will they wield more influence than the potential billions of users and trillions of devices?  What happens when microtransactions based on bitcoin are inherently tied to the internet of things?  Are these corrupt bankers going to shut it down thus destroying trillions of connected devices?  These corrupt asswipes that want to ban the advancement of the human race, time to make them irrelevant.

Well i have paper bip38 wallets from a few years ago, never spent from them so assuming they are ok.  Also, if someone can break bitcoin encryption then that is the least of our worries.  Just about everything digital would be compromised.  It would be a digital apocalypse.

I fail to see how they can keep their site running and continue to take people's money without repercussions.

well, you would simply use the bitcoin to buy things with straight bitcoin-bitcoin transactions.  for example.. wow, i made 20k in bitcoin this month.. well book a vacation using bitcoin, pay for the whole thing using bitcoin, etc.
