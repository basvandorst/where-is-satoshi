Why not use multiple blockchains? To check if a given address has the ability to send you X bitcoins, you have to check N blockchains for the info

BTCChina just raised an A round from Lightspeed. Buttercoin, Coinbase are YC. It just seems like the Silicon Valley VC and angel ecosystem are putting money into bitcoin companies.

A charity campaign kickstarter. User can create a campaign like "raise 1000 mbtc for charity X by Y date". If they hit it, the bitcoin gets sent. Otherwise, the mbtc are returned to sender.

millees for mBTC, mickees for uBTC

I like millees and mickees

That would fit with every other class of asset. You don't pay tax on stock when it goes up in price, only when you cash it out. 
You do pay tax when you exercise stock options with a strike price below the market price. Then you're receiving something (stock) worth more than you paid, so it is income. 
But when you pay market price for a stock or a bitcoin, the subsequent gains aren't taxable til you cash out.

why can't namecoin support arbitrary TLDs on top of the .bit namespace? For example, .bit.me

He's a court philosopher. He gives the elites what they want to hear, dressed up in a cloak of pseudo-science. If you understand him for what he is, you won't be so upset. 
Fish swim, birds fly, economists spout shit. It is the way of nature.

I'm going with millees and mickees (for uBTC)

I feel like a cheap fuck sending my friend .008 btc to payback for beer and burgers. And it's hard to do the math to see if that's the right amount. 
mBTC are way easier. Can't wait for coinbase to switch over.

When that happens, he will be a trillionaire. Unless he got hit by a bus, I can't imagine someone walking away from that power and wealth.

Can we switch the bitcoin bot to a smaller unit? Does it take mBTC or uBTC?

The real use of bitcoin in China is to [avoid currency controls]( The best thing for Chinese adoption is if hard assets (foreign real estate, bullion) are available for sale in BTC.

Good question. There isn't a clear analogy to mining in the world of other financial assets. My guess is that it would be defensible not to pay taxes on it until you sell it, under the theory that it is like creating any other good of value: if you knit a sweater that you intend to sell, you don't have to pay taxes on its market value until you actually sell it. 
But I'm not sure. This goes to illustrate the unique nature of bitcoin. I would say "ask a professional", but to be honest 99% of the professionals will take your money but not know shit about bitcoin. It's too new, and retail tax guys aren't exactly the guys from the top of their class. 
I intend to pay taxes on cash profits from sale only, until we find out different.

Unfortunately, transaction fees make micropayments in bitcoin infeasible.
