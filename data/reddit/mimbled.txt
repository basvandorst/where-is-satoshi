Soooooo pumped for this.
@_date: 2019-08-27 01:58:26
Yep. Same scam, different marketing team.
@_date: 2019-08-27 02:01:25
They both served the same function though. Push the big block narrative.
@_date: 2019-08-30 02:30:48
Too fucking late.
@_date: 2019-08-27 13:57:41
I'll second this prediction.
Edit: To specify, November 2019.
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:03:32
Thought so. Thank you for clarifying!

Use a wallet that supports Replace By Fee in the future:
This lets you update the fee later on if the transaction is taking too long to confirm.
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:54:02
This should work for you: 
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:12:34
1) Why are you doing this?
2) In your opinion, what's the most unethical thing Chainanalysis is doing?
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:23:35
That's some bullshit. If they disable buying, they should disable selling and vice versa.
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:45:34
I guess the equivalent of a "void" would be using the RBF to not only increase the fee, but to also change the address that you're sending too. So you effectively send the money back to yourself minus the fee necessary to initiate the transaction back to yourself. This is commonly known as a 0-confirmation double spend.

This is literally the, "And then they fight you" moment.
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:21:28
Geez, come on. Circle did the exact same thing a few years ago when they discontinued Bitcoin purchases from their main application. Get it together Circle.
@_date: 2019-06-14 16:32:49
Hah, probably true...
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:33:45
Yep. And that be bullshit.
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:41:05
Ding ding ding. And it's been going on for ages.
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:07:02
Haha, well of course we know that, but they don't. A censorship riddled centralcoin is leagues ahead of this decentralized, open, p2p, trustless thing we call Bitcoin. This is their attempt at fighting Bitcoin. This is their AOL moment. People will, over time, see this banal walled garden for what it is and shift over to Bitcoin just as they shifted from AOL to the internet more than a decade ago.

As I stated in a previous comment: As a scam, bcash is on par with Bitconnect at this point. Implementing it into your project displays a certain level of incompetence/ignorance. The fact that you chose to name bcash over say another altcoin you mentioned says a lot.
@_date: 2019-04-01 12:10:08
"Bitcoin and BitcoinCash(ABC) SPV..." No thanks. Hard to take this project seriously if bcash is involved.

I agree with the last two points, but why wouldn't you want it to sync when you open it?
@_date: 2019-09-05 02:52:28
I'm sure Razor is already on it.
