Somebody help me
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:13:47
I stopped reading at "I had not 2fa. Only password". 
I've seen dozens and dozens of horror stories describing situations where Bitcoins are stolen, you know what they all have in common?  THEY DONT USE 2FA.  I saw a newbie account yesterday describing how he bought .1btc and the first thing he did was enable 2fa.   You seem to have been using Bitcoin for quite some time now, but you aren't smart enough to use 2fa?  Sorry, but you brought this on yourself.

I have a MacBook running the latest version of Mavericks and was having your same issue.  I went and bought a Raspberry Pi for $50 and installed ColdPi (google it) which comes with Armory and Electrum pre-installed.  
I never have and never will connect it to the internet, but I do use it to great new wallets and addresses offline, you can then save a "watching-only copy" of wallets and drag them onto a [USB thumb drive then plug the thumb drive into your your Mac and drag the file onto your desktop and have Armory read it].  It's your choice whether to use Electrum or Armory, I'm using Armory.  In Armory, when you have loaded your watching-only wallet, you can receive payments and monitor your balance, but in order to send anything you must create an "unsigned transaction" file, drag it over to the RaspberryPi and have it "sign" the file, then drag the signed file back to your Mac's Armory and it will broadcast to the network.  The same instructions work with Electrum.
This method of signing transactions from offline wallets seems like the safest way to store your Bitcoin. 
For a more simplistic Wallet that runs on Mac, check out Hive.  Hive stores your wallet file on your computer though which is no bueño unless you like getting your BTC stolen. Many people like USB drives with Ubuntu or Linux, I like the Raspberry Pi. Any offline device is recommended for storing large amounts of Bitcoin. 
[Edited: I forgot to mention I use a USB thumb drive when transferring any files from my Mac to the Pi and vice versa.  The Raspberry Pi is plugged in separately from my Mac and the USB thumb drive is used as a "shuttle" for transferring watching-only wallets and offline transactions]
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:54:21
I've been using my Raspberry Pi as a cold storage device for a few months now and I can honestly say it feels good to have my coins secured properly
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:59:57
you send it to a new address* not a new wallet.  This is called a change address.  Many wallet clients do this to keep best security practices, however it is not required to use a change address.  You can change the settings for change to be sent back to the original address

raspberry Pi with electrum and bitaddress.org for offline transactions and generating offline addresses
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:52:25
Actually, Bro, it is offline.  Yes, hypothetically someone could create malware that is trained to sit in my Mac until I insert my USB key for 20 seconds while i sign a transaction, then it has to go onto my Pi where it must get through another level of encryption in order to grab my private keys.  Then it has to make it back to my Mac in order for anyone to get my private keys.  But the chances of this happening are very very slim.
Obtaining 100% efficient security is near impossible.  As the level of security increases it gets harder and harder to get the last few percent.  I'd say the method I'm using keeps your Bitcoins 99% secure.  I was very careful about storing my Bitcoins properly and after countless hours of research I am led to believe this is currently the safest way to secure your coins (other than multisig)
If you can present a better/safer way of doing cold storage I'd love to hear it.

 Are you kidding?  So many companies offer discounts for paying with Bitcoin, and it's usually more than the assumed 3-5%.  Newegg for example saved me $150 for using Bitcoin to pay. 
I understand you're saying western union offers a service to send money internationally, but why would I pay them 25-30% when I can pay them instantly for no fees with circle.com ? Just wondering why you resist change. Kind of like "if it ain't broke down fix it!" mentality.
I prefer to use money with no restrictions and no fees.  Short term volatility is an issue I'm willing to deal with.

What?  You realize that you are paying to store your money in a Bank right?  Whether you like it or not, a Bank is a business.  Their goal is to make money off you.
You may think your bank is "free" but you'd be lying if you told me you've never paid a single dollar in fees to your bank whether it be overdraft charges, too many withdrawals, sending money internationally, or sending money between different banks.  Also, you are paying 3-5% higher prices for merchandise due to the "convenience" of using a debit card linked with your checking account.  Not to mention, money sitting in your savings account with 0% interest is actually losing value over time as the money supply grows.

I used 2-FA enabled for login, withdrawals, and trades.  My mistake was when my other phone broke and i tried logging into BTC-e and i didn't have the code from GAuth i tried unlinking my 2FA.  It was that move that caused me to be locked out for 2 weeks.  Support claimed it was an automatic system and can't be undone.  
I made a new account, transferred enough money to chat (backed up the 2FA qr code on this account) and talked to MoosaNYC (admin) in the troll box and he said he can't help at all but that it happens pretty commonly.  So now each time I try to log into my locked account I can't get in at all, it says "you're account has been locked until the 16th of April for security purposes".  and kicks me back out.  So for now i'm trading on a different account.
Lucky for me I sold LTC at $13.36 and that account has been in fiat the entire crash over the last week.  If it stays under $13 when my account becomes unlocked i'll profit!

Consumers do not "agree" with that.  The average consumer still hasn't even been exposed to Bitcoin at all or even know what it is for that matter….
 If everyone in the world knew exactly how the Bitcoin protocol worked and wasn't plagued by mainstream media's negative portrayal of Bitcoin I believe it'd be much clearer to see the benefits and I truly believe as infrastructure continues to grow over the next few years that a much larger portion of the world will begin using Bitcoin.   Paypal seemed like a pretty crazy idea at first too…why is that even still around?  Because it's easier than a credit card…much like Bitcoin

Hey Patrick,
You should cover the different scenarios in which the blockchain could be used. Talk about decentralization as an alternative to regulation, but try to keep it less political and more about the leap in technology. You could also speak about the new age of globalization this technology will bring to the world and how we see this ongoing battle between regulation and innovation, but regulation can't keep up.  As a result of this, we are being propelled into a new era where trade is uninterrupted and financial information is kept private.  Lastly you could talk about how the internet brings peer-to-peer revolutions one industry at at a time and inevitably we are moving to a a decentralized financial system that will reshape governments worldwide.

yea you don't want to ever leave your Bitcoins on a web-wallet (Coinbase or any exchanges) because they'll have the password to your private keys and you won't technically control them.  If you create your own wallet on blockchain.info you will have created your own wallet and kept your private key safe.
However, as your potential investment keeps getting bigger, it's advised that you do some research on "Cold Storage" in order to properly secure your coins to your full advantage.

Feels great doesn't it?  Just make sure to NEVER connect your Pi to the internet.

Intrinsic value is defined by each individual.  Society as a whole has made an implicit collective agreement to consider the US Dollar to have value.  We accept US Dollars with the future intent to spend them and exchange for goods and services in the future.   
Bitcoin's "intrinsic value" comes from whatever each individual determines it to be.  Not everyone is as upset with the legacy banking system as I am, meaning that not everyone sees the same value in Bitcoin as I do.  It will take a slow and eventual realization for the average citizen to see the "intrinsic value" in Bitcoin but it really pisses me off when politicians throw around the term "intrinsic value" like it's supposed to mean the same thing for everyone...

As far as I know, after searching, there isn't an easy implementation at the moment.  That'd be great if you could create something like this.  
Ultimately, I'd want it to run offline on my Raspberry Pi.  I use it to generate offline addresses with Electrum and if I'm generating a vanity address with multi-sig functions I want security to be the most important part.  So I don't want to have to run a script that pulls a file from the internet, I want to be able to drag a source onto a USB drive and drag it onto my offline Pi.  Are you capable of developing something like this?

So proper cold storage requires me to buy another computer?  Don't have a spare one lying around... and if it's never connected to the internet how does it update the blockchain to recognize my recent transactions? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:01:08
Chances are no malware entered your Pi for the 30 seconds you were connected to the internet, but there always is that small chance.  Even if malware did get into your Pi, as long as you never connect it to the internet again you should be fine.  Unless, of course, a USB-Jumping-BitcoinWalletStealing-Virus jumped onto your Pi in that 30 seconds and next time you sign a transaction you're fucked…. But the probability of that is very small.  So you should be good

This is cool,  I use something similar that's existed for a while:
They've got electrum, armory, cgminer, multibit, and a few other BTC apps. You're offering your product for cheaper but it has less features. Beef it up a bit with some more BTC apps and you'd win out the market share.

I had a small IRA account set up for working a part-time summer job for a couple of years worth about $900.  I made the decision to withdraw it even though i had to pay income taxes on it.  After taxes the amount was worth about $739, i took that and bought 1.6 BTC at $450/btc.  
That amount in is now worth more in BTC than if i had originally left my IRA in US dollars.  It will sit in Cold Storage until I retire.

Right I understand there is a small possibility of malware jumping onto my USB key, onto my Pi, and then back onto my online computer… but the probability of this is small enough that I'm not worried about it.

Bitcoin does this amazing thing.  It makes people actually care about internet security.  Bitcoin allows you to be your own bank.  Secure your money as you see fit.  Personally, I use a cold storage because I don't want any of my money stolen, but it is up to you to apply your own level of security.

So here's my question:  when the authorities ask you to hand over the private key to a bitcoin address they assume is yours, can't you just answer "that's not my address. I don't have the private key"?
Doesn't the pseudonymous nature of the blockchain make it so it's near impossible to prove that any one address actually belongs to somebody?  (Unless they find your private keys on your hard drive through and warranted search of your personal belongings. But assuming you have a brain wallet...)

It hasn't peaked.  Thousands of startups around the world are injecting billions of dollars into infrastructure, usability, and trusted global exchanges.  It's all coming very soon, be patient, educate yourself about the fundamentals of Bitcoin, and make an investment based on your knowledge.
Personally, I believe Bitcoin is in its infancy at the moment and is rapidly growing.  What is happening currently with the price is a minor setback due to poorly ran exchanges (Mt. Cox).  Ignore everything you read in the mainstream media.

Wasn't planning on ever cashing out to USD from btc or ltc.  I was planning on initially converting all my BTC to LTC right now while the exchange rate is low, then as the LTC/BTC market begins to rise swap back to Bitcoin at a higher rate (0.035/1 LTC) then I'd be using now (0.02479/1 LTC).  Won't this ultimately yield me more BTC if they continue to interact proportionally?

Look at his face during every interview, he's like the OJ of Bitcoin. He knows he got away with it and shows zero remorse.   Plus, with Bitcoin it really isn't that hard to hide your money and even if people find the address it's hidden in, nobody can seize it from him!  He'll do time in federal prison for a small amount of time and when he's released he'll cash out his massive stash and retreat to an island for retirement.

There's nothing to be skeptical about.  The creator is a well-known contributing member that runs a local mining pool in Arizona and is offering a great piece of software already compiled making it much easier for the average user to instal on their Raspberry Pi.
Also, even if he could implement a bug, it doesn't matter because you should always have your Raspberry Pi offline anyways.  The only way he could steal anything is if you connected your Pi to the internet.

I just downloaded the newest version and believe I've found a bug.  I'm running Armory on a 2010 MacBook Pro with Mavericks 10.9.2.
Every time I try to open the application, it jumps up and down on my dock and then force-quits itself.  I am never actually able to fully open the app.  I noticed this error was occurring on the previous version as well.  I have a desire to use Armory but am currently forced to use Electrum due to their OSX support with the latest version of Mavericks.  
I really hope you guys can fix this bug so I can open Armory and switch over from Electrum!  (Posted this on Bitcointalk as well)

What a train wreck. I just keep thinking... "They don't understand, startups are racing to this emerging market and it makes sense to use why the fuck don't you people be open-minded and try it because when you do you'll see how much easier it is to make payments!"
All those people laughing at us focus too much on the "virtual currency" aspects and libertarian views associated with Bitcoin too much. I believe Bitcoin finds it path first  as payment system. Then as it becomes a common payment option among the internet and the majority of stores around the world it will make US dollars irrelevant since Bitcoin will be accepted everywhere and is easier to transfer. LOTS of infrastructure and developments need to be created before any of that can happen tho.

My addresses were created offline and my Pi never has and never will be connected to the internet. Armory takes too long to download the blockchain (a few days), Electrum doesn't need to download the blockchain it hosts it from a server. 
Offline transactions with Electrum on your RPi is the best way to go.

Yet I've received emails from support saying "Hello! Was requested unlok 2FA. Your account for safety was blocked by an automatic system for two weeks. Lock can not be undone before the expiration."
Which is it?  2 days or 2 weeks?? And once march 4th comes, will my account still have 2FA or will I be able to log in without it?  It's very frustrating having support that is unwilling to help.

I am currently a Senior at San Francisco State University and have been a Bitcoin advocate, enthusiast, and investor since early November of '13. I've been on r/Bitcoin for a few months now and am working to become an active contributing member of the Bitcoin community.
I wanted to find a way to spread awareness about Bitcoin and help diminish the "evil" reputation the media has plagued Bitcoin with. I decided to start a student organization on my campus in order to help the cause. I tried taking a few tips from the organization Michigan State currently has running...
I have clear ideas of what I want to do with this organization. Initially we will hold informational meetings explaining how Bitcoin works starting from the creation of the Blockchain. I have a collection of videos that provide great explanations of certain aspects of Bitcoin and plan on showing them at our meetings. I will show students how to set up their own wallets and I'll be donating some of my own Bitcoins to give out "free Bitcoins" as in incentive for people to attend.
Ultimately, I'd love to crowd-fund a donation to the Janet Pomeroy Center for Rehabilitation (  ) to show the philanthropic side of Bitcoin and hopefully gain some media attention. This crowd-funded donation will be created after we have held our initial meeting and students can comprehend the basics of Bitcoin.
I have created a Facebook group: 
and registered a proper email address: SFSUBitcoin
and created copious amounts of flyers which I just finished plastering across my campus a few minutes ago: 
I just started group this today but plan to focus on continuous improvement over the next few weeks. I believe college campuses (especially in a progressive city like SF) contain future users of Bitcoin and the more we can do to spread the word the better the result for Bitcoin.
I would love to have the support of the r/Bitcoin for the organization and any constructive feedback is welcomed!

By the time any kind of institutional organization takes action the women will probably already be sold as sex slaves.  The whole "we don't negotiate with terrorists" stance really isn't effective, yet at the same time I agree we can't just give in to any request a terrorist demands.  In this scenario, I think it'd be much more efficient to rapidly produce a crowd-funded address that we can use to quickly buy back the women so they can avoid a miserable and horrifying future as a sex slave.  I'm pretty sure he's only asking $200 each, that's an easily reachable target.

Running the latest OS (10.9.3) with the latest version of Armory and it works great.  Still in beta, but you can use it with OSX now 
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:57:29
Get a USB-SD adapter so you can plug in your SD card to your computer. 
What operating system is your online computer running? The hardest part about cold storage is how many different operating systems there are, what version of each operating software are you using, what wallet client are you using, and which hardware devices people use as a cold wallet. These are all variable and can make the process confusing. There are plenty of tutorials online but it took me quite a while to figure out how to set it up for my setup. I have a Mac running OSX 10.9.1 running Mavericks for my online computer, and for my offline computer I have a Raspberry Pi Model B running Rasbian with "BitcoinPi".  
The current version of armory didn't work properly with Mavericks and so I was toying around with VirtualBox running Windows 8 off my Mac trying to download the blockchain and after weeks of reindexing and downloading I never got it to work. When I found out electrum worked on Mavericks I scrapped everything and tried to find out how to put electrum on my Pi. Then I found Bitcoin Pi which made it easy.

Will Trezor ever lower it's price? I imagine there will come a point where one Trezor costs over $10,000... I want one but until they lower prices to something more affordable I'm sticking to my raspberry pi

These derivatives also let market makers take leverage long positions with up to 50x at 796.com and 20x at OKcoin.  we can move up or down with large orders of magnitude at any given time. The bubble has about deflated and we're beginning to experience natural growth it seems.

Nope, I'm currently waiting for my account to be unlocked.  Same situation as OP, old phone broke in water though and I had to install GAuth on my new phone which lost my QR code from BTC-E.  Learned this one the hard day.  Still waiting 5 more days for my account to be unlocked.  I've literally spammed the shit out of their support with over 40 messages and no luck.
After this learning experience, I've learned to never use GAuth again!  Use Authy, they actually have reliable support who will be able to retrieve your QR codes for you.

Many vendors on Etsy do accept Bitcoin.  Etsy is simply the hosting website for independent vendors.

Totally agree with you.  Planning on using a Multi-sig address for our campus Bitcoin organization so that no single individual has complete control to our funds.  I want to be able to generate the transaction locally and offline.  Even when I do generate it, the process of signing the transaction seems more difficult than it could be.  User-friendliness and accessibility is needed for Multi-sig functionalities, hope someone smarter than me can develop something soon

What exactly is the protocol for a Broker to accept Payment in Bitcoin?  Aside from setting up a secure wallet, is BitPay used to convert to fiat after the transaction?
Hypothetically a buyer could use Bitcoin, the Broker could collect his commission in Bitcoin, and depending on whether the seller accepts Bitcoin or not, the payment could be converted to fiat if needed…. correct?  Accepting payment with Bitcoin should be fairly similar to accepting an all-cash offer right?

I have it.  It's cool, but all it does is display your balance so far.  They said they'll add features later but still I see no updates. 
I agree, they are the best possible bank, I love them for everything.

This was it.  But they have moved since I last checked.
Edit:  looks like they mixed their coins for anonymity.  They split into two address and continue to change addresses several times from their.  No way to tell if Winklevosses own all of those addresses or sent them to other people.

Personally, I think all the new money at Poloniex from ETH-tards is going to flow into LTC and NMC.  They will run their famous volumizer bots and contribute majorly to liquidity.

The transaction is still pending, once it's complete you can withdraw.  Takes a day or two at the most then the BTC is yours to do what you please :)

I just don't see the value in Litecoin aside from quicker transactions and more coins (which is irrelevant).  Why should a merchant accept Litecoin at all if they accept Bitcoin and Bitcoin is more widely used?

Probably the fastest way to acquire Bitcoins right now.  While I was waiting for verification at 4 different exchanges after I had done my first purchase at Coinbase and had to wait for it to complete, I would go down to safeway and buy a visa prepaid card and redeem it at giftcarddrainer.com for Bitcoins, you receive them instantly
