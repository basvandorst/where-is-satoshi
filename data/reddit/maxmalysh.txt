Oppressive governments will rather jam a user into a prison cell. Why bother with satellites?

Don't be so positive. Authoritarian regimes already have and use technology to control the internet (e.g. the Great Firewall of China). Deep packet inspection is a common thing. 
There is no way governments will allow freedom of money transfer. 
Big brother is watching. He just hasn't decided yet whether to regulate cryptocurrencies, or to crackdown on them.

You can. But someone has yet to develop this guerrilla stuff. As for now, governments use DPI and [others methods]( to block Tor, and the same can be done with Bitcoin easily.
Governments don't block Bitcoin not because they can't (it's easy), but because  they see an opportunity to regulate it.

You can download and store the blockchain without any problems. But you need an internet connection to create a transaction. Oppressive governments already quite successfully control internet traffic within their countries.
Their control over the financial system is even better. You have to buy or sell bitcoins somehow. This is where they'll catch you.

Agree. Antminer S9 Hydro pushes 18TH/s and requires a huge radiator to dissipate the heat: [

This. Bitcoin is highly traceable. This has nothing to do with KYC. It's easy to trace all transfers to large cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets and marketplaces thanks to the blockchain.

We are still looking for a solution.

No bank in Estonia will open a bank account for a crypto-related company. SEB is not an exception. Source: we asked a local consulting firm to contact all these banks.
LHV might make an exception (as they did for Coinbase), but you should have really large monthly volume to work with them (millions).

Didn't research this option yet. It all boils down to opening a bank account. 
By the way, check Netherlands and Bunq:
They do open accounts for crypto-related companies.
