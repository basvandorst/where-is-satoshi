Why do I have the feeling McAfee is raising a chicken named Dick.

The point is you haven't gained or lost anything until you sell. The amount of money your portfolio is worth is hypothetical until you convert to fiat.

It's more like buying a phone for $5 then selling it a little while later for $1000. Then buying 2 of the same phone for $200. Then it would be perfectly reasonable to say that I made $795 and got 2 free phones.

No, that's a pretty reasonable way of looking at it. OP already say he had plenty of other investments put aside for her. He took something that had already tripled for him at least (don't know what he bought in at but chances are even in this dip it's probably plenty more than he paid) and put some aside for his daughter. From an objective perspective it sounds pretty reasonable.

Were they jelly bellies or the other kind where you can only define the flavor in terms of color?

So how does it work because this has confused me since I heard about it? Not being sarcastic, I really don't get it 
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:55:49
But you wouldn't realize any gains at the time of the trade because both sides of the trade were equal value.
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:53:10
True, it makes the scams much more effective

There's a big difference between buying something at one price, selling it for 10x that later then buying 3x the amount shortly after and saving money for years then burning it. Ashes will always have a value of about 0. Despite this clearly fud-ridden agenda that's running rampant in this thread, even during this dip btc is about 5x the price it was this time last year. With a couple notable exceptions, bitcoin has pretty steadily gained value from its inception pretty much more than any other asset. Name one other asset class that is 5x higher than it was a year ago. You can't because there isn't one. Bitcoin has more inherent value than the fiat you're pricing it in that would definitely lose its purchasing power over the next 14 years. In the end he traded inflationary bits of data for deflationary bits of data. Sounds like a pretty reasonable thing to do.

I was guessing a chicken... Turkeys are rather large and would be a lot to eat on your own.

Who knows but here's some sauce for it: 
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:54:06
It would seem so

I have yet to see one of you morons actually give a half thought argument to anything I said. Come back when you can actually say something intelligent because you clearly are incapable of independent rational thought and the idea is obviously going way over your head.

It's to illustrate the approximate worth of the note. A trillion Zimbabwe dollars is worth almost as much as one third of a rock. 10 trillion has about the same value as 3 rocks. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 07:50:47
That's about as likely as it starting to rain jelly beans and gumdrops but it does illustrate the idea. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:06:29
I was wondering that myself actually... I Googled it and the average life span of a chicken is 7-8 years. There's about a 3-4 year span between when he said it and when the time line would be done so well within eating range. Incidentally, I saw something recently about how silicon valley's tech elite are all raising chickens so it kinda adds up.

Why are you being down voted? Everything you said is 100% true and none of it is really controversial. I guess there's some Unix haters out there or someone really hates the idea that an iPhone is an evolved ipod. I have to assume since this is happening on the internet that they don't have a problem with tcp/ip but who knows, this is reddit.

Thanks, I think I get it. If I buy $1000 worth of bitcoin and a few months later the price goes up and I trade that same btc and get $1200 worth of ltc at the time I owe tax on the 200.... Is that right?

You seem to have overlooked that he bought it with gains from selling at ATH. At worst he made slightly less money than he would have otherwise by putting a portion of it back in. It's already pure gain so even if it did go to 0 there was no loss.

You don't get out much do you? I've had responses to that comment that are more stupid including yours. Why do you feel so threatened that someone else made some money off trading and wanted to do something for his daughter? Did you not get enough hugs as a kid?

He paid $600 a coin... He hasn't lost any money

To me it would make the most sense if the value of the ltc was determined when you actually sold it but I'm not the irs.
