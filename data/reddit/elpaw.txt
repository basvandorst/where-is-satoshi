You don't put btc on a hard drive,  you put the private key there. The bitcoins aren't destroyed, only access to them is lost, at least if the encryption is unbroken

I thought it only used the hashing functions of openssl, not the heartbeat part? In other words you are never running as a server?
@_date: 2014-05-31 21:17:14
The hash rate would be something crazy - around 10^73 H/s
Anyway my example was the extreme case. With lower difficulties, you still get collisions (but over the course of not 17, but thousands of blocks)

Billions of people around the world do not have cards or even banking. (Look at China's recent crackdown on alternative payment methods). That is a huge untapped market for online commerce. 
(And yes they do have internet, mobile internet is huge in Africa etc)

So that they can spend those outputs (hence pay people out) faster.
Imagine if you only had one wallet with a few thousand btc in it as a single input, and needed to pay a few people 1 btc each, you would pay one person in one transaction and then get the change back. Then you would pay the next person in the next transaction with the change, etc etc. It would all take many transaction blocks.
With the thousand btc split across many inputs, you can pay all those people in parallel in one block.
(Obviously you could pay all the people in one transaction, but only if "all the people" are one single entity; in general "all the people" will be acting independently and be requesting transactions at different times.

You need the miners to secure the ledger. Otherwise anyone could make it up. That is the value that they add.
You need to reward the miners, otherwise why would they do it?

In theory currencies could go negative. People would pay you (in goods or services) to take the currency.

I'm not talking about an attack per se -
if the difficulty is large, then the the block hashes will be of the form 0000000000.....0nnnn... (with N hexadecimal digits n), and N will become smaller and smaller. Eventually you will have to have repeating block hashes for different blocks. E.g. in the most extreme case, N=1, and so there are only 16 different possibilities of the block hash, so if you have 17 blocks, you are guaranteed that at least two of them have the same hash

The previous ATH was at the peak of a bubble.
What you want to compare the situation today to, is the excitement the previous-previous ATH ($260) was broken on the way up to $1163. It was relatively calm.

You misunderstood my question. I am concerned about the integrity of the block chain.
Each block stores the hash of the previous block. That is the only way to know the order of the blocks, which block comes after which.
With a large enough difficulty, you will start getting these hash collisions. So for example you will have a block with the previous block hash being 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003cd1. But there will be many blocks with that hash, due to the collisions. So you will not know the position of this block in the chain.
