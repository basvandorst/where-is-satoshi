That's honorable! It would be totally awesome if you could create a JSON feed with historical trades (including the internal transaction id). Preferably RESTless so we can limit query to reduce load. :-D

I'll read it :D
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:09:43
accordingly to that picture, this is a buying opportunity.

Until something better shows up, Im building a wallet full of Peercoins. I figure Proof-of-stake will be more difficult to subvert and it will run smoothly also over darknets. I look at it this way... you have this KncMiner operation in Sweden where they have a huuuuge floor with zillions of hashing power. All of which could be replaced by more or less a simple laptop. Which is the most cost effective system Bitcoin or Peercoin? Which is the easiest for the military to compromise? Ayeaa... Bitcoiners dont get this (I own more bitcoins then peercoins measured in USD).

What if it was Dorian _himself_ that faked it!!! Did not think of that, now did you! Personally I would prefer more yber important info like this being doxxed because it is really important and very good for bitCoinz.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:13:12
It's even more important then people using your site to do trades on ;-). Just kidding, but actually yea I am for sure hoping that you will get the resources to do so. Oh.... and while I'm at it: I think it would be totally awesome if you could add Peercoins (PPC) to the site. The reason for this is the following: people can buy BTC locally and using many different exchanges. However, with a trustless decentralized p2p exchange, the trade between PPC and BTC can actually be automated and create an extremely smooth user experience. You would be the _first_ to do this and exchanges such as cryptsy would be totally uninteresting to use which implies that all those people who trust cryptsy and risk loosing their money trading PPCBTC on that centralized site, wouldnt have to do that - since they are using your site!
@_date: 2014-03-23 07:34:03
How many percent of your capital allocated for bitcoins do you have in fiat right now? I have about 10% in USD and if it goes down now, I will only buy if it drops at least down to 400 but preferably to 100. Not much point buying higher then that since I only have 10% to play with. I.e. the 10% is my "double down insurance".
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:55:47
Yes. A little bit disturbing in a way I guess. I'm walking a thin line here. Somewhere between brilliance and insanity.

People do what other people do. A lot of people had money at MtGox, so a lot of people figured it had to be safe - because a lot of people thought that is was.
I didn't have a single coin there. I have been trusting my coins with btc-e.com instead - even though it is generally considered to be an untrustworthy site by many people. Why? Because we don't know who the owners are.... Ahhhh... so did THAT help you with your money on MtGox?! ;-)
@_date: 2014-01-14 13:13:50
That's true until its not.

actually no. check my post history. some people dislike me, but im not trying to make money on them.
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:34:43
What if it turns out that Bitcoin is flawed? Then Bitcoin could die. A flaw could be the centralized mining and the economics behind it. Peercoin might prosper though.
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:10:16
Do your own homework. Trust no one. _Thats_ why Bitcoin is open source - so you dont have to have trust and faith.

I am a share owner, I view this is a good thing.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:37:36
Had I bought more shares I would have sold too, but I only have a mere thousands shares or something so basically I have nothing. Im planning on buying a whole lot more. I will do just like you, buy when price have stabilized somewhat. Bee have not yet launched yet either, so Im thinking there's a spike ahead of us also.
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:34:33
could be variance, but its to early to tell. I had discussions with people who says they don't care about GHash.io accumulating more and more power. They don't care because... well they don't. (I care, so don't blame me)
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:22:11
Yes, so thats why I only have a small amount there. Pays to be prudent and not having more on the exchange then what you need to buy when people panic. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:23:21
 Peercoin mentioned as a solution!

If you look into their business model, it seems to me as though they need a bull market because they are insuring customers BTC purchases (in the lock account). Which implies that if the market drops a lot, Neo might get into trouble but if the market goes up a lot they stand to profit more.
Since they just opened their doors to customers, I figure that they _did not_ have to cover the drop from 1000 to where we are today. This MtGox thing can't get much worse from here I think - I mean people can't loose all their money twice, so whatever happens next is not that MtGox shutdowns their site and erase their twitter feeds and what not.
My bet is that most of this goxxed crap has been priced in now and what people will soon figure out is that the Bitcoin protocol wasn't the issue. It was simply a gox thing.
Also, all those who had _a lot_ of Bitcoins and really believed in it, well if they don't get it back they will have to buy new Bitcoins from elsewhere to replenish their wallets. Meanwhile wallets with concentrated wealth has for sure taken a hit here, which also implies that wealth distribution which I also consider a health thing. If gox finally dies, that would also be great news.

Thankk u for the constructive criticism. Love u 2
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:13:01
This is the tragedy of the commons (sort of). People renting mining equipment to make a few bucks and dont care at all about the survival of Bitcoin. Why should they, as long as they earn USD? There is no solution to this problem in Bitcoin. Realizing this I bought Peercoin, which has a Proof-of-stake. Im sure I get downvoted but thats ok. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:13:38
lol, I'm not at all that influential. Basically people like you is why I created my own subreddit. It's so strange though.... I tell people exactly what to do to make money and they tell me to go fuck myself?! I'm not even asking for something in return. It's just so strange.
@_date: 2014-03-23 07:14:39
I believe this to be a fair assessment and the fact that the latest major bull run was due to Chinese uptake, could imply that we will see price going lower. However, price have already crashed a lot and we're now at some serious support levels. Add to that the fact that US regulators are letting Bitcoin grow and that many other countries are also seeing the Bitcoin economy grow we just might have a counterforce to the China thing.
What I do is this: 
1) Have a position in bitcoins that you do not sell.
2) Take a position in peercoins, that you view as a leveraged play on Bitcoin.
3) Have USD on exchanges, but not more then you can afford to loose due to exchange fck-ups.
4) If price collapse, buy bitcoins like crrraaazy!  
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:12:31
I guess this one should have been a warning:
And also this:
I mean... I bought in at $10 and traded it up to a point where... well I made a lot of money. All the time everyone was calling it a joke, ponzi and what not. _That_ is exactly the kind of back drop you want on a bull run. Right now Bitcoins are far less interesting I think. Personally I will be looking towards silver mining and gold and stuff like that. 
Dont get me wrong, I still got +100000 usd in coins but hey... its not interesting anymore. Ill just put them in cold storage and see what happens and then focus on the markets like gold silver. 
There will come a time to trade Bitcoins again, but at this level its not interesting. If it goes up to 1000 usd Im at it again or if it goes down to 200 or something. But at this level... nah. unintressting.  
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:39:27
If you really, really, really want to know I can tell you. Do u want to know?

This is what they were referring to: 
@_date: 2014-01-26 13:11:34
Yes, thanks for putting it out there. What we want is competition in currencies - especially so in programmable money. The scam coins and AltCoins that dont hold up will die and in time people will learn. Unlike with the existing entrenched banking system where the turd floats to the surface and no matter how much we try to flush the system, it just floats there on the top.
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:10:51
Absolutely. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:04:26
So basically what you are saying is that u dont give a fck about making more money on Bitcoins if it all goes down the crapper because OP already made a few bucks. Not only kind of discussting but also very irrational. Maybe S.N. didnt factor in peoples stupidity when developing Bitcoin. Thanks for sharing your view though.
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:56:41
Well, he isn't saying that Bitcoin is necessarily a bad investment, only that he himself do not how to value it. Same could be said for many other assets. Gold however, that is an insurance if guns, gold and bullets is where we end up after the end of the world event. Sure.... I guess he has a point, but that doesn't mean that  bitcoins will not be worth a whole lot more in the future.  
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:09:32
Ooooh my god what kind of crap is this? Are you totally insane? What I would like to do is to have OP pay for everything, just because... it would be fair. Somehow its just fair that people that have nothing to do with it pay for the greed of others.

Well maybe you have a point. If its flawed, well then it is. Rationaly I can't argue against that. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:58:32
By the way... he has been pushing gold for a long time and its has gone down for a long time. Though he says he knows how to value it, the market have proven him wrong. Same thing with all the other gold bugs. I think they have a point though, everyone should own some guns, some dried food and a tent. just in case.

You can trust nobody. Why on earth do you think you should trust other people with your hard earned money? The whole Bitcoin thing is built on around a trustless system for a good reason. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:28:16
Last day I talked with old school traders looking to buy Bitcoins. They could see it being popular on the web, but thought it was strange that everyone can print how much they want. Lesson learned: most people have no idea how Bitcoin works and buy because price is goingg up. They have no clue and even if u told them they wouldnt understand. Old time Bitcoin holders have been through the same scare before. Finally, weak hands (people selling fast out of fear) have already been wiped out in the last crash.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:07:39
Yea I agree, people loosing to much will probably not buy _everything_ back. People loosing a little probably will though I think, at least those who are "believers". I dont know. Just what I think. But Im crazy.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:56:45
Sorry to hear that. For what its worth I think suing is probably the right thing to do. I did have a very hard time getting back my money back in the days. Paranoid as I am, I only tried to withdraw a small amount in EUR and when they failed, I withdrew in BTC instead. After several months I started shouting from the roof tops on their facebook pace and what not and I quickly got my transaction processed after that. I was lucky. Sorry to hear that you're not so lucky.
If you don't buy new bitcoins after this and if bitcoins goes up, you will probably feel even more miserable. I hope not, but it's a risk. It was goxxed that failed, neither Bitcoin or you. It was gox. Don't let gox ruin your future too.
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:11:12
Actually Ive not downvoted you even once. Why would I? Everyonce oppinion deserves to be heard inn this topic I think. Please know that my stake inn btc is greater then that inn peercoin. But if bitcoin pools continue likely this... I just dont know. You know?!

Or... military enters Bitoin mining pool facilities and threatens to shoot pool operator. Three of the major pools gets compromised and cause super chaos in the blockchain. Price drops like a stone, military buys cheap coins and then dump them all on the market at once causing super depressed levels. 
Everyone "realizes" how "dangerous bitcoins are to society and how much harm it can cause in the economy" and gets the public opinion to sway in favor of more or less death penalty for bitcoins involvement under "terrorist laws". 
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:03:44
y accident I bought ten times more Bitcoins (it wasn't a lot of money so that's)then I thought I did when it was at $10 only to realize my "mistake" when it was hitting above $50. 
EDIT: Oh and selling at 900 and buying back at 423 was a good one too. Actually all dipp buying feels good. Taking the coins off "weak hands" and putting it in my own strong hands that never sell for cheap. Kind of doing everybody a service I recon.
