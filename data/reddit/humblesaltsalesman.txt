Actually, that's not true. it's very sound investment strategy to look at a trend, and then look upstream to see who the B2B vendors involved in supplying all of the customer-facing companies in that industry are and invest in them. You could 'invest' in color TV by investing in the component manufacturers for instance. Individual brands may come and go, but the suppliers only start hurting if the entire industry starts shrinking.

Dude, fully 25% of all BTC are estimated to be lost forever, where do you think those came from?

Roomba, it's called a roomba.

I dunno, I've heard similar stories from a lot of people. If you were a kid wanting to buy weed a couple years ago you probably bought some BTC and forgot about it, that's the impression I have.

I mean, is it hard to believe that a lot of people bought BTC when it was almost nothing and then totally forgot about it?

What *does* happen when a hardware wallet fails? do you lose the coins?

I was thinking about this antifragile thing from an economist's perspective... If you do pull off a hard fork with success, you can essentially double your capital. Does this not incentivize behavior that is inherently risky with respect to the stability of a coin? EI: hard forks seem like something that will happen with regularity do to the incentives.
