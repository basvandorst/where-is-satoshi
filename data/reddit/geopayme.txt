One more speculator out of the Crypto coin business! - Only Merchant acceptance is the proper solution for crypto coin survival for the future!

I posted the article as educational material, because I thing that its time to unify LTC/DOGE so it can support market growth for BTC. Its hard to use BTC for consumer/merchant acceptance, but LTC and DOGE are the perfect candidates. But why have both, the mining technology is the same. I think by unifying them, we can create a more favorable exchange from LTC/DOGE to BTC for consumers and merchants. Its something that we have as a vision for 
These are some of my thoughts.

True on what you say... but the dirty bankers have other plans. I will say it once again here, crypto coins will not survive just on speculation alone. Unless cryptos have wide merchant acceptance with limited speculation so they can feel that the risk to use them will not eat their bottom line of their revenue, ultimately cryptos with flounder and fail. They will not disappear but will become insignificant in a global economy!

How does that affect US merchants that use the Coinbase exchange merchant API?

The $$ is showing its last positive face as a  singular reserve currency...
Like a fish out of water, it looks alive and feisty, but ultimately gasping for lack of water!
It will fight to the end, my only worry is, what end? WW III? I do not put it past it for the 1% to create a 3rd WW. Its not their offsprings that will be fighting WW3... they will pitch some patriotic propaganda with the MME and everybody would be happy to kill each other!

Possibly true, since the same corporation exists in the US... I find it interesting, who will be infringing on copyrights? - I know the yankees love to go after people or organizations that violate their laws.
If you want to know what the Americans think about AML 
If there is a view that the yankees will not go after anyone doing business in the ME particularly Iran they must live on another planet.

He sells Gold and Silver, so its a very US centric point of view. Nevertheless bitcoin has its place.

You can open an Account on BTC Greece and follow the process for legal limits. and Coinbase does report to FinCEN activities. So best of luck and keep it out of forums.

Good question!

I don't know how BTC can have acceptance after is was placed in the derivates market! What merchant wants to accept a coin with such high volatility. No merchant will take the risk that will effect their bottom line revenue.
