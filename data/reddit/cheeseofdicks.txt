Same here, I never received any email about their closure. I bought coins through their exchange in November of 2013, played around until the crash in December of 2013 and then just let the coins sit there. I did not log onto the exchange since December 5th of 2013, it was not until mid 2016 that I tried logging into my VoS account only to find the exchange had closed. Supposedly the sent out emails saying they were closing in February 2015 and that they were going to be reducing accounts by 25% per month for next 4 months when said accounts would be liquidated. I certainly never received any emails about closing, the last emails I got from VoS was in June of 2014 about a survey and one in April of 2014 from Adam Cochran about a free trading month. I wonder if they gamed their notifications by not sending out emails to the accounts that had been inactive for long periods of time, hoping that they would only find out far too late. Looking through my last orders I had a little over 68 LTC on their exchange, I should have cold stored it.

Wonder how many others out there are like us that did not get notified. While searching this issue this forum post came up 
Another forum thread from way back where a user of VoS did not get emails either, but found out about closure via from said thread
