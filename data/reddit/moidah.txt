How do you know that?
That (s)he or they wanted it to be "as free and open as the internet"?
I am asking because I don't know, perhaps that was said, but all I know of is that S.N. did technical writings, I haven't heard of any philosophical or ideological writings- Please correct me if I am wrong.

Glad you said it.
Satoshi is Tabula Rasa that people are projecting their own ideals onto.
I do wonder if people have a theory that is more than a wank to their god.  
Why would he want to remain anonymous?  He is holding 2 million coins...

Scarlett is Canadian and Naniwah is Swedish, so while it may be equivalent, USD is relevant to neither of them.
If you think about it, makes sense to have a BTC purse for a lot more SC tournaments.

I'll take that bet.  People who have Windows phones like them.  Perhaps not enough to get over the drawbacks, but still.
Nobody likes BlackBerry.  The platform is already dead.
Also, even though it's a failure, Microsoft will never let WP die, look at Bing or Windows RT.

It's not at $300 in USD. Never was.

He is believed to hold 2 million BTC, no?  
If that money moves, it's a huge shock to the system.
Then there is the question of why is he choosing to be anonymous at all?
