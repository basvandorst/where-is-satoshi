I totally agree! If we want changes, we must  change "the rules of the game" primarily.

I think that the government is afraid of losing control over cash flow!

I think this day reminds Laszlo the worst operation he ever had

Bitcoins system is more flexible and at the same time unpredictable. Сash flows are regulated by the banks, payment systems and etc. The most difficult part is to provide it self-regulation. B/C for example hackers are trying  to destroy system.

Recently  I read somewhere that ATM was open in Amsterdam. Does anyone know where exactly it is there? Is there a commission?

Awesome! I hope it will become Bitcity soon!

I think it will attract new Bitcoin followers.
 
Ps Will  be charged fee for the using of SMS-Wallet? How much does  it cost?

I totally agree! 
PS This post may interest fans of Ashton Kutcher, and they will become Bitcoins «followers»

Looks like I might just get 1-2 SSD and a USB drive, which puts me $100 short of making the $300 mark. Anyone buying roughly a $100 item that wants to pair up to reach the $300 for the discount? Discount would be split according to the ratio of purchases we make. IE if I spend $200 and you spend $100, I will get 2/3 ($50) of the $75 discount and you get 1/3 ($25) discount?

I would like to attend the meeting, but I haven't had the opportunity. I hope that materials will be posted.

I think this is one of the best developments of Google lately

ITA! The basic law of the market is "demand creates supply." If there is no demand development of Bitcoin won 'have no point. Middlemen are not "leech" on the contrary, they are some growth stimulants.

True story! 
IMO, It is time for the government to decide what Bitcoin is the object of legal and tax industry

I envy the students of the MIT!!! I would went to this expo with great relish.
I wonder how many students already have Bitcoins?

As stated.. this is new technology.
Yes, the fees are a little high.
Yes, I have to wait a little while for transactions to confirm.
That being said, I FULLY support this kind of tech!  Grin
Since I am blessed to be close to one of the two machines in the USA, yes, I am going to use the machine.
I want to support it's operation... I want to see more of them -- in every store and on every (other) corner!
Fees will drop... wait times will improve... but only if there is interest in the technology!
