Thanks! Will do!

We do not work for McDonald's.  They do allow us to place donation canisters in their restaurants and they do perform other fundraisers we have asked them to support throughout the year... they are a tremendous help to our mission.... but we are not one and the same... The confusion is understandable and I do understand and respect that there's nothing I could say to change your mind.  That's ok by me. Anyone who volunteers, donates, advocates for good causes doing good things is family to me.  We are all rowing the same boat.  I would just like to ask you to reconsider making a blanket statement that I and the folks I work with do not care about humanity... I have plenty of self doubt, but caring about my neighbor is something I hold as a priority at home, work and play... probably much the way you do.

Thanks for the kind note and sharing your story. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:23:52
And I will add... when they saw a $500 donation... they were quite pleased and impressed.
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:50:53
I thought we were there! will double back with an update.
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:46:18
wow, THAT IS AMAZING!  Thanks so much!
@_date: 2014-12-02 20:17:48
I did not mean to imply it was not awesome for us!  truly is all good.

Our current house has 16,  within a few weeks we will open our 3rd house which will add another 10 bedrooms.  We have one tiny bedroom just off a busy kitchen we will likely convert to a pantry, so our capacity will be 25!
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:51:43
you told your story, that's priceless.  
@_date: 2014-12-02 20:11:21
awesome, thank you! that piece of advice was given to us by the local gent who reached out and encouraged us to learn up on bitcoin and has helped us along the way... 
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:50:23
All RMH's take different approaches to fundraising... we pride ourselves, or at least I pride myself, on the work we have done to expand our donor base... believing the best way to connect is to let people do something they love and find ways for that to benefit us... from Comicon's to hockey tournaments and leagues... we literally have an army of supporters in our region who raise money for us...we see the bitcoin community along those lines... We are also blessed to have some very long term employees on the program side of the business which I feel allows for more creativity on the fundraising/admin side of things...
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:58:32
wow, that would be something.... will be bringing that idea forward!
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:22:56
We skew older when it comes to our board and volunteers, so some were more confused at the concept than myself... but those who took some time and read up on the info we provided seemed to grasp it.  Our investment policy statement and gift acceptance policy do not allow us to hold any gifted stock, collectibles, etc --- all must be converted to USD's so as long as we agreed we would adhere to that policy, we were good to go.  Some have since wondered allowed how long until this concept would be so mainstream we would have to consider updating those documents... but I would say thats a way off.
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:18:28
Will do.  I know my friend Martin in Northern Alberta is light years ahead of me in all things tech and he is very interested and if he pulls the trigger he has the gravitas in our RMHC Executive Director world to really get folks interested... but I will do my part :)
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:48:43
Perfect sense... my ability to pull it off, eh, not as clear :) but an awesome idea added to my bitcoin learning list.  We do maintain wishlists so it is a perfect compliment to that existing effort.
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:30:27
Thanks!  We're thrilled to be here!    
One of the realities that drew us to accepting bitcoins were the microdonations that can be generated.... we have been in that business forever... In our area (Albany, NY) we collected over $250,000 a year via donation boxes at 70 local McDonald's... average donation is likely under $0.25! We know how donations can add up.  And we also appreciate how this community/economy is so very trust and reputation driven... hopefully the work we do and the manner in which we do it continues to build trust and a positive reputation.
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:08:59
Gosh, I should have covered that in my intro!  Great question.  We are a home away from home for families who have a child being treated at a nearby hospital.  Our families are from a 30 minute drive away or more on average.... In Albany, our partnering hospital is Albany Medical Center and it draws patients from a large footprint as it provides services/treatments small regional hospitals cannot (Premature birth, cancer, trauma, etc).  We provide our families with a private room, bath, amenities, volunteers are on hand from 9am to 9pm to help them/us, we have a warm home cooked meal every night provided by a local group, business, family, etc.... we basically take care of their every need here, so they can be bedside as much as possible as that is what their kiddos need most - a rested, focused mom and dad and family to be there for them... We also operate 3 other programs, but about 65% of our budget goes to the House
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:27:00
Thanks for that feedback.  We do have to adhere to our current investment policy statement and gift acceptance policies which require us to liquidate stock, collectibles, (even pop tabs!) upon receipt but that is not to say those could not be changed.    
We have found that this is a remarkable economy and a passionate informed community... and we do effort to meet donor expectations as much as possible
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:50:00
We are learning about changetip --- and have received donations via that channel already... but are not at all savvy yet... local bitcoin guru has it on the list to show me about though...
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:48:13
In the USA, we are all independent of one and other, and rather decentralized, which I think is a good thing as our oversight/control is left by and large at the local level...    
With that said, good news travels fast and the Executive Director community pays for a self governed sharepoint site where we share ideas freely... which I will use to update the group...    
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:12:01
we have private bedrooms, as long as they do not smoke or eat in there, its all their business and nobody else's :)    
We do see the stress of caring for a sick child can cause, and studies do show their family dynamic can be damaged beyond repair... we do have a wonderful House Director who will assist/refer as best as we can... But the real private stuff is their business :) and technically we do not /cannot provide medical/mental health care...
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:32:58
Is it good reddit form for me to pop into a convo like this?....
Apologies if this is bad form... from my perspective you are both are expressing your views including but not limited to what's best for us... just  happen to see things differently... Can I declare a tie? :)
@_date: 2014-12-02 20:09:45
1.  I have not found any tangible downsides other than skeptical board members who worry about the stories they have heard about people losing their bitcoin investments, etc... our investment and gift acceptance policies require liquidation of non USD donations, so thats what we do with bitcoin, stock, collectibles, art, cars and poptabs... though it seems like the bitcoin community would value us holding a % so it is something I will share with my folks    
2.  We like it for the micro donations and from what I can tell, is where our sweet spot will be... with the ability to "tip" and donate from Twitter now and our love for our McDonald's canister program which raises $250k a year from 70 local McDonald's we know how much small change can change lives   
3.  sure, my email is jyule    
PS - Awesome about Kevin Guest House!
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:45:43
Awesome point!  Will add that to my talking points :)
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:54:39
make that 41 donations... 4 new ones have come in!
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:45:08
We are obliged to report donations over a certain amount via our 990 form, but in all candor, I do not foresee us hitting that threshold here... Don't get me wrong, generally speaking we love to know who our donors are (we do NOT sell that info - ever!, but like knowing)...
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:30:15
We are with bitpay, I will add that to my learning list!
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:28:50
We are not owned by or managed by McDonald's... We do maintain a licensing agreement with them that has two main purposes - 1) to protect their trademark and 2) to ensure we operate within all pertinent laws, rules, etc locally, at the state level and nationally... Beyond that, they have little reach or control.    
In the USA the 1st House was started in 1982 when a Pediatric Cancer Doc in Philadelphia asked the Philadelphia Eagles pro football team to help her buy an empty YMCA across the street for her families to use... She was frustrated with them sleeping on the floor, in chairs, waiting rooms, cars or going broke in hotels.  The sponsor who ponied up the $ was McDonald's and thus the name... The concept of corporate philanthropy as we know it did not exist then... it was very grass roots and local from what I know... The concept spread around the country... in NFL cities... as it seems the owners kept close eyes on what others did...    
We opened in 1982...     
We are not advocates for McDonald's but I have many wonderful friends who own McD's restaurants, work for McDonald's, own companies which service them, etc... End of the day its people...    
Completely respect your decision to invest charity dollars in causes / orgs close to your heart.  We are about keeping families close to their sick kids, never charging for any of the services we provide, and working to meet their every need.  McD's is our biggest partner no doubt, but we are a separate entity with a unique mission statement and purpose.    
I hope this is not taken as offensive, etc... just wanted to share my view/perspective

No challenges ... just needed a lot of hand holding from the gentlemen who introduced us to Bitcoin and the folks at Bitpay who we chose to handle our account.    
We have had 37 donations in the past 14 days since we launched!
Not just saying this to be a good guy... but we truly feel as long as you are helping a charity doing good things that you trust, you are helping everyone as charity truly is the water which raises all boats.  Whether its Albany, GA or Albany, NY we are all rowing the same boat (sorry for the double water reference)    
And we will promote our efforts to our peers... I believe our friends in Alberta, Canada are on the verge of accepting... 
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:33:15
awesome, thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-02 20:21:43
Thanks for all of the incredible feedback, ideas and the opportunity to engage in a meaningful dialogue.  All and all a pretty cool experience for me.  Will be back in the coming weeks with updates :)  Best, Jeff
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:09:06
We are their charity of choice, but we do not have that kind of influence on a macro level... on a local level, we have 5 owners on our board and sing the Bitcoin praises to them all the time (especially when they discuss trying to attract younger adults, etc)... We have a board meeting this Tuesday and I will be sure to remind the entire group of what this community has been up to on behalf of the House!

We raised $1,291.82 in USD via our lighthouse campaign
On Monday we will spend that on a new pump :)
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:04:30
Blown away... raised 17.6% of the goal so far... incredibly generous and impactful community...
And my apologies for the typo fest that was our webpage... I am horrible at working without a net so to speak...(my proofer in chief!) Jeff Yule
