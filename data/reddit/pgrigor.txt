You don't "verify" the whole block -- you verify the block header.
Transactions prove their right to be included in a block through the merkle tree. Whether 1/100th of the transactions are present matters not.
Block headers and merkle trees confirm transactions, not the other way around.
A "pruned" blockchain still includes *every* block header. You don't delete blocks in pruning, you delete transactions.

@_date: 2016-08-29 15:48:06
Each transaction that's included in a pruned block must reference *non-existent* inputs -- because they've been spent and therefore pruned. Until you reach the pruning depth (in blocks) any transactions downloaded *must be* part of the UTXO. The presence of the transaction in a block indicates that transaction was accepted as valid by the network at the time.
Conceptually there's no difference between a spent input and a deleted input: neither are allowed to be referenced as inputs in a subsequent transaction.
@_date: 2016-08-21 16:22:10
You're arguing my point :/
My argument was that if a central bank didn't devalue the currency it would be just as good as Bitcoin. You're stating that central banks devalue currency or have the propensity to do so and that makes them inferior to Bitcoin.

More full nodes make the network more robust, but not more secure. The protocol provides the security.
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:44:59
Well assuming I am catching up rather than starting from scratch then, ya. :)
You can't produce a false block without the proof of work. The best you could do is present an orphan as the main fork -- but that wouldn't last for long because that orphan wouldn't be built upon by the network and I'd know after some time that the chain I was fed was broken.
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:02:45
All I need to start is a copy of the genesis block hash -- any chain you give me can be verified to be the correct one from this genesis block.
Unless the node I connect to has *generated their own false chain from the genesis block and continues to do so* I can determine whether they're giving me the right chain. :)
Of course starting with only the genesis block is improbable -- I'll probably have a lot more block headers than that to start with. This makes it even *more* unlikely that I get fed an incorrect chain.
@_date: 2015-06-18 22:23:26

@_date: 2015-06-23 20:26:33
Yep, you're right:
1/ Once they see the block header for a valid block then miners can start mining an empty block (not really empty -- but just one transaction: the coinbase);
2/ Once they receive the whole block miners know which transactions can be included and will probably start mining blocks with greater than one transaction. 
There *is* a risk with 1/. If a malicious miner mined a block with a double-spend then that block won't be validated by the network and hence valid block really wasn't mined. This is a very small risk, however, as miners don't have an economic incentive to do so.

Isn't this a circular argument? If a majority of nodes accepted a bloated block then, by definition, it wouldn't be a bloated block.
Perhaps the consensus rules can't depend on the instantaneous state of the mempool for *a particular node*, but if the mempools of the majority of nodes (or all) don't contain a high percentage of a published block's transactions then this is an indicator that the block has been purposely bloated.
Consensus, IOW, would *not* be broken because *every single node other than the malicious miner's* could **not** have the bloat transactions in their mempools.
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:46:07
You miss the point -- trust has nothing to do with it.
If I connect to 999 bad nodes and 1 good node I know which one is the good node because of the protocol's requirements.

This is the most important observation here. Miners don't spend lots of money on hash power in order to shoot themselves in the foot.

How is this different from what currently exists? If a miner published a 1GB block then it is rejected once 1MB is received. Under the new rules if a miner published a 1GB block and 99% of the transactions were bloat transactions the node would reject it once it saw a certain number of transactions that weren't in its mempool.
That is, if the mempool was 1MB and the threshold was 50% the node would reject the block once it saw 1MB of transactions that weren't in its mempool. No need to download the whole block.

That is a 51% attack. All one needs is to buy enough hashing power. It's the same thing with bloated blocks -- the investment in hashing power must be made first. This is what's known as an economically irrational actor -- bitcoin was *not* designed to handle this, ever.
Even the original whitepaper states that the majority of nodes must be honest.

Sorry, it simply doesn't (and can't!) work this way. :/ Where are you getting this idea from?


Invertible bloom filters scale linearly -- they basically work like a compression algorithm. There is no known algorithm which allows for communication of an infinite amount of information utilizing a constant size.
Therefore, there will always be an incentive to mine smaller blocks. This works against the incentive to gather greater fees. It's a negative feedback system as far as block size goes.

No it means that 2^96 public keys will hash down to the same value, and therefore the same address.
Because the numbers are so gargantuan it really means nothing -- the chances of generating a private/public keypair that hashes to the same bitcoin address is still 2^160. (2^256 (ish) possible private keys divided by 2^96 possibility of an address collision).

That's iffy. It would most likely be that a node's memory pool wouldn't even receive the transaction.
Remember, the majority of nodes *reject* this transaction. Why exactly would they then relay it?
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:22:06
Regarding your first concern: regardless of whether a block header is transmitted with or without its composite transactions other miners still would have to wait for all transactions to be identified before beginning mining the next block. Transmitting the block headers first simply acts as a "placeholder" so that other miners can't jump the queue with smaller solved blocks.
Regarding your second concern: An algorithm could be developed which gives a submitted block header a priority depending on its age. Miners would keep mining the current block until all transactions are received from the "placeholder" solved block header. If the placeholder header becomes too old without its composite transactions it "self-orphans" itself and another placeholder header can be submitted by another (or the same) miner.

@_date: 2014-08-11 20:18:34
Yes. :)
The receipt of the block header by a node would act as a "placeholder" while the rest of the block was received. In this scenario a 10GB block would win out over a 10K block *as long as its header was received first*.

I'm not sure you could get away with splitting 1 BTC into 100,000,000 satoshis in one transaction. Every transaction you made would further incur a transaction fee, and if you wanted to do this quickly the fee would be prohibitive. 
I do think that a minimum fee should be in place. Or minimum percentage. I've been gravitating toward this.
Of course, 1 bitcoin today isn't 1 bitcoin in the future.

If, at the time Bitcoin succeeds, then if people think this way then there will be no revolt. If not, then there just may be. If it's true that people see great value in paying taxes then they'll pay; I suspect that this may not be the case. We'll see.

Anonymity is overthought. "Plausible deniability" is a more important concept -- transfer of bitcoins from one address you own to another you own cannot be proven until the coins move once again to an address that can be associated with your identity.
Furthermore, the fact that bitcoins cannot be confiscated means much more than any anonymity.

When Bitcoin is used correctly (never reuse addresses) this is far from true. Until a transaction is made with a monitored third party there is *no distinguishing* transfers made to another from transfers made to oneself.
Furthermore, with no counterparty risk Bitcoin is immune from involuntary confiscation.
Bitcoin is a tax collector's nightmare.

At present I'm not seeing how the changes would be drastic at all. An extremely low fee per transaction, as currently is the case, wouldn't really affect the mining process much. But it would put in place a stable method of allowing miners to decide upon fees now and in the future.
I don't think we want to get to the point where miners start removing themselves from the pool because block rewards aren't sufficient and *then* try to solve this problem. That would be hugely disruptive.
Better to solve the problem now when it doesn't affect anyone much and give the miners time to plan for what their next move will be when the block rewards diminish.

Beside loans (and *possibly* credit cards) a bank's function can be displaced by other companies.
The deflationary spiral myth relies on extreme fractional reserve banking. Interest rates adjust in a deflationary economy just as they do in an inflationary one; the problem is that we have interest rates set by fiat as well. :/
Consumer spending doesn't dry up because of deflation, rather savings increase. Nobody is going to starve themselves and their family to death because their money is going to be worth more in the future. Same with things like automobiles, housing, etc. Items and services have a utility *now* that must be compared with their cost *later*. A perfect and glaring example of this is the current technology industry. The only thing deflation affects is frivolous spending and investment, which is a good thing.
Plus we're not talking about the kind of deflation that occurred during the great depression (the fault of the Federal Reserve, ahem) where the money supply dried up by 1/3. Rather we're talking about a deflation that results from increased participation, efficiency and productivity in the economy.

In the 19th century the tax burden on the populace was around 3% of GDP. There was no Department of Education, Department of Homeland Security, FBI, CIA, or any of the recognizable government agencies that we have today. Yet this was the period of greatest wealth generation (and, I might add, the greatest display of private charity) that the country ever saw.
There was no limit on legal immigration because there was no welfare state -- immigrants came to be productive members of society.

Because businesses will be incentivized to run full, well-connected, nodes in order to detect double-spends. End users can use SPV.
Additionally, bitcoin nodes in the future will have a more robust api that can be used by end users, negating the need for electrum/unisystem type servers.

@_date: 2014-08-05 03:46:41
In practice this isn't how it would work because not every peer is connected to every other peer.
For example, currently there are around 7K reachable nodes, but each node is only connected to, on average, 50 or so other nodes. So the ratio of connections to possible connections is less than 1%.
So in my example, which was a simple one, your criticism may be correct. But in the larger network it isn't anywhere near N^2 because of the limited connectivity of each peer.
Furthermore the protocol doesn't actually send the transaction but rather an "Invite" message which let's other peers know that the transaction exists -- it is then up to the peers to request the transaction if they don't have it.

Having miners remove themselves from the pool *en masse* (which would happen today if the block reward wasn't there) would be extremely bad for the network. If this were to happen the incentive to perform a 51% attack on the network would be greater than the incentive to legitimately mine.
Furthermore my proposal still works with the currently difficulty "base" (as it would be). If miners removed themselves from the network, or if they started demanding higher fees, the base difficulty would decrease.

The *full block would still be propagated*, just as it is now. The only difference is that a peer would start this propagation after receiving and verifying its header is correct, rather than store and forward once the entire block is received, as it is currently implemented.
So a peer starts receiving a new block -- currently if the block is 1GB it has to wait for the entire 1GB to be received before forwarding it to its connected peers. In async block forwarding the peer would start forwarding it to its connected peers after receiving the *first 80 bytes*. Nothing is left out, it just propagates in O(1) time.

If it's true that he's cutting the transaction forwarding bandwidth by half then he's proposing a O(n/2) solution, not O(1).
Asynchronous forwarding achieves O(1) because propagation begins after (always) 80 bytes received.
Furthermore he's proposing a protocol change. With async forwarding there's no protocol change needed.

What most people misunderstand about brain wallet scanners is that the fact that they usually don't "guess" at pass phrases in real time, but rather use something called "rainbow tables."
Rainbow tables are databases of *pre-computed bitcoin addresses* and their associated private keys. A database may have billions or *trillions* of such addresses and are structured in such a way as to make address lookup very fast.
A brain wallet scanner, therefore, simply listens to bitcoin transaction traffic and looks up transaction addresses in the rainbow table in real time. When a hit is made -- because of a poorly chosen generating phrase -- the rainbow table also has the private key for the address in question. It is then a simple matter for the scanner to generate a spend transaction for that address and steal the funds.

You are thinking of a hierarchal system, not P2P. If it was a hierarchy then this would be true for the top servers in the hierarchy. In a P2P system each node, on average, would only upload a received transaction to one other node.
For instance: we have four nodes A through D. A receives a transaction and sends it to B, who sends it to C, who sends it to D. :)

Again, like I've said a dozen times in these threads, if a tax revolt occurs the government *won't have the means* to enforce this scenario. The manpower and resources involved in monitoring the complete economy and enforcing tax collection would be mind-boggling.
You're thinking of the government as some sort of supernatural entity without the requirement of being funded. This simply isn't the case.
Furthermore, even if the government was to determine how much one held in bitcoin, seizure is out of the question. It is, even today, quite easy to secure one's private keys in a way that makes them immune from confiscation.

If new nodes need the full blockchain with all its transactions this is because of software, not a requirement of the Bitcoin protocol.
The blockchain is perfectly valid without *any transactions*. Only the block headers (80ish bytes) are required. Unspent outputs are required in order to spend and that's why they're kept, but once they're spent there's no need to keep them around.

The hash of a block is a hash of the merkle root, the block's nonce (an incrementing value which miners use to try to "find" a valid hash) and other block information. The merkle root is derived from all transactions that comprise the block. This is what ties any particular transaction to the block in which it is confirmed.
It is difficult to find the valid hash given the block's information -- it is trivial to verify that the hash is valid for a block's information. Simply take all the block's transactions and compute the merkle root, then take that merkle root and the block's other information and hash it: if it matches the block hash solution then the block is valid.
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:48:28

Bad analogy.
The only change we're talking about here is generating your own addresses for payment rather than an outsider. Also we're not talking about stocking a soda machine -- we're talking potentially 1% of your *sales*.
All that is required to happen is for a decent piece of software to be written which provides both blockchain connectivity as well as a merchant gateway -- of a much better quality than the gateway provided by the bitcoin reference implementation.
Once that's done it's pretty easy to hook up with a much lower-cost exchange and sweep needed bitcoin funds on a regular basis.

I see no reason for this to be the case:
Let's say we have 10,000 peers, each connected to 50 other peers. First peer to receive a transaction will send to 50, then those 50 to 50 more each (total 50 + 2500), then those 2500 to 50 more each (2550 + 125,000). You can see that in this (very) simplified propagation that every node would have a copy of the transaction in only 3 "hops".
As the network grows by orders of magnitude the peering connectivity doesn't need to grow linearly.

"government favors"? Like what? A government without means hardly has any capacity to dish out favors.
The government looking the other way is an excellent point. I would say that the government has, in the past, shut down any system that threatened this sort of scenario, because all prior systems had the burden of centralized control. Think Liberty Dollars, e-gold, and the like.
This time it's different. I don't think that government is ignoring this -- I think that they are powerless to stop it. As far as I can see, short of shutting down the Internet *worldwide*, it is not possible for the government to stop the economy from converting to Bitcoin should it so desire.
There is a good reason Satoshi decided to remain anonymous: if his invention does succeed he will be hated by tyrants the world over.
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:57:05
Monitor all you want. With the continuing development of anonymizing algorithms this will give diminishing returns.
At the end of the day even if they somehow prove someone has funds that is far different from getting their hands on them. Once enough people resist, government doesn't even have the funds to do the monitoring in the first place.
The critical difference with Bitcoin compared to cash is that, with Bitcoin, one can prevent seizure of funds *and still transact at a distance*. You can't do both with cash. Cash needs the banking system to transact at a distance.

No, it would be O(1) because the propagation from a peer starts as soon as 80 bytes is received. 
Regardless of whether a block is 1M or 1GB the *propagation* of the block will be O(1) but the complete download of the block will be O(N). However it's the *propagation* of a block which determines whether it's a winner, not the complete receipt.

Not true. It is fully-validating nodes who decide which block is orphaned or not, not the miners, hence the original propagation problem in the first place. If the validating nodes decide the 10GB block is the winner miners must mine on that.
But we have a bit of a cart-before-the-horse problem here: once async block propagation is in place there is no incentive to mine a 10K block in the first place. That incentive exists today *because* of the problem with synchronous propagation.
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:52:49
I didn't say to worry about it. I just stated a fact of the nature of the network.

It will end awfully well for those folks who persuade those hoarders to part with their coins. :)
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:37:44
I'm not sure that's a fair example. :)
Under your scenario it seems this miner only has a 80Kb connection to the internet. In this case it would take him almost 28 hours to receive the 1GB block. He can mine on the 10KB block but I'm not so sure he'd be the winner.
More realistically the miner has a 100Mb connection minimum so the 1GB block would be received in 80 or so seconds. A miner with a 1Gb connection would download the whole block in 8 seconds.
The problem for the miner is this: do I mine on the block that I reasonably know my better-connected peers have received? Or do I mine on the block that I downloaded first?
The async forwarding allows miners to be *notified* of which blocks have been solved in a much more real-time way. One can mine on the later-received block but then they're taking a big chance that a better-connected peer has already started mining on the larger block.
In your example if the miner was mining the 10K block and got beaten out by another miner mining on the 1GB block he'd really have no chance of ever rejoining the network -- it would take far too long for him to catch up. :)
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:54:38
Yes. The arrival time of the block header will determine the winner, not the *completion* time of the block's propagation.
But... this is key: miners will have *NO INCENTIVE* to mine a 10K block in this case. They will know that the first 80 bytes of the solved block is what counts and secures their block as the winner, not the total size of the block.
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:33:59
IMHO the greatest feature of Bitcoin is that it can be hidden quite effectively from confiscatory actors while at the same time can still be used to transact at a distance.
This is the first time in history that this has happened, and is all because of the removal of the need for a trusted third transferring party. Previously one could hide one's wealth but could not then transact with others, even in person, very easily. Now one can hide one's wealth and pay -- and be paid by -- anyone anywhere in the world.

@_date: 2014-08-08 16:18:09
So then pruning is impossible? :)
Why, exactly, was a merkle tree implemented then?
What I meant by a block without any transactions is a block where all outputs have been spent, and those spends buried under enough blocks. There's practically no difference between a spent output and an output which no longer exists.
What would be downloaded per (legacy) blocks would then be valid unspent outputs, which at the time of that blocks creation would have been verified (i.e. the mining power was honest at the time and those unspent outputs are valid)
If a new node downloads the longest-work blockchain they should be able to rely on the fact that transactions only entered that blockchain because they were verified as honest (from valid unspent previous outputs) at the time by a majority of the network. You seem to be getting things backward: the merkle tree verifies that a transaction belongs to a block, it's not the transactions that make a block valid.
Your statement of trusting miners is a bit inaccurate. It should be "If you only downloaded block headers and their unspent outputs then you'd be trusting that the majority of mining power is honest *and* the network verified, at the time, that all unspent outputs in the block were valid." In this scenario there is no practical reason for a new node to need to download the unpruned blockchain.

Only the output addresses would have those amounts -- the inputs would be (most likely) for different amounts, and the output for each user would be split between the sending address and a change address. There is no feasible way to determine which address received the funds and which address was used as change unless one owns either.
In other words, no, the inputs rarely match the output amounts exactly.

What is interesting about this is that block headers are perfectly acceptable *without* any associated transactions. Blockchain pruning relies on this.
Separating the block header from the transaction transmission is a good idea once blocks get really big. A miner would have to identify the transactions which comprise the merkle root of the block header in order to have it accepted.

@_date: 2014-08-11 20:03:26
I understand this completely. However I'm talking about having O(1) propagation time to get rid of the incentive that currently exists to mine smaller blocks. Communicating confirmed transactions in a block more efficiently is a separate issue.
Furthermore waiting for the communication of transactions will lead to *more* orphans as it takes much more bandwidth and propagation time to send this information than the 80 byte header, regardless of how compressed and optimized the communication of these transaction may be.

Another solution is to have bitcoin nodes start transmitting solved blocks immediately upon notification. This way the solved block would propagate the network *much* faster than with the current method which is to wait until all data is received before communicating same to peers. Of course if the block header wasn't valid no retransmission would be attempted.

That may be true, but it misses the point -- merchants don't care one bit whether their customer is paying down their balance or buying on credit.
The initial point of the OP still stands even concerning the credit scenario: 1/ Bitcoin will be used by those who can pay for their purchase; 2/ CCs will be used by those who can't.
Of course those who can't pay for their purchases tend to be higher risk than those who can. This will result in even higher fees to merchants as the CC companies try to mitigate their losses.

Very interesting view. However I'd like to make a further point: From a business standpoint taxes are counter to the profit motive. If even a small amount of businesses decided to revolt they would have a competitive advantage -- others would follow suit quickly or not be able to remain viable.

You're missing the point -- once cryptocurrencies become more mainstream governments have *no funds* to enforce bans -- fiat will be accepted less and less by government employees. Banning exchanges only slightly hampers adoption, as Bitcoin users can accept bitcoin for the products and services they offer rather than buy bitcoins.
Furthermore bitcoin peers can easily be upgraded to use random ports to communicate, making internet filtering useless.

24,000 simple (600 bytes) bitcoin TPS is around 14.4 megabytes per second or 115 megabits per second. That's a lot of traffic but easily handled by data centers and the pipes at even small companies.
At that rate the average amount of transactions included in the memory pool of bitcoin nodes between blocks would be around 8.6 GBytes. I have more memory than that on my laptop.
Furthermore, when blockchain pruning is implemented the blockchain would achieve a stable size directly related to the amount of transactions rather than growing forever.
@_date: 2014-06-06 03:42:41
A tax revolt isn't individual tax evasion. It occurs when an uncontrollably large number of people decide to evade. It is the government's worst fear.
Even if 10 million people revolted (an amount almost five times the current prison population in the US) it would be impossible to put them all in jail. Once the 10 million revolt all the others see that enforcement has become impossible and decide to revolt as well.

Right. Currently it's false. That's why the proposal. :)
The "winning" block would be the block first seen -- blocks would be seen by the network in O(1) time because of the async relaying.
I should have written "the header, when received, is a *timestamp* for its full block -- once a full block is received the timestamp determines the winner"
Generating an invalid block header is infeasible so still only valid blocks would be propagated.

The order books need to absorb a reasonably large *wealth value* without swinging the price, which entails a much higher BTC price.
Consider: if one BTC was worth what 10,000,000 USD can buy today, a 30K buy would be worth 300 billion, which would surely move the market.
What needs to happen before it's money?
* 1/ needs to be used as a medium of exchange;
* 2/ once enough use it as a medium of exchange it becomes a store of value as merchants and consumers don't cash out;
* 3/ once enough merchants and consumers use it as a store of value the price vs real goods stabilizes and it can be used as a unit of account

Unfortunately we don't know if this is a good deal or not at present -- this is why a percentage-based fee needs to be implemented. If we stay with fixed fees then 3BTC might be an astronomical amount in the future, or not. At present if we have one million transactions in a block (impossible because of block size limitations) then the fees will add up to 100+BTC. In the future if a bitcoin is worth $100K that would be a ten-million dollar payout per block -- or $10 per transaction (approx 3.6 billion in fees per day). Eek.

Merchant adoption will result in *negative* price pressure as long as merchants decide to cash their bitcoins out for fiat.
Once enough merchants adopt, however, there is no need to cash out because merchants can pay their bills in bitcoin. At this point transactions exist in a "closed loop" and the price rises. This is because excess money reserves will be held by merchants in bitcoin thereby decreasing the supply available for purchase.

If you'll look at the first comment on this thread you'll see that all of these block propagation "race" conditions can be solved simply by having the bitcoin client start to propagate the block solution as soon as the block header is verified (80 bytes, no big whoop). This would almost completely alleviate the problem of long block propagation times as it would be the block headers competing for propagation rather than the complete block with its transactions.

We're talking about *propagation* time. The time for the solved block's header to propagate the network. If nodes start forwarding after 80 bytes, regardless of the size of the full block, then propagation will always be O(1).
It's propagation that determines the "winning" block -- even now. However now blocks have O(n) propagation time because currently nodes wait until receiving the full block before they start to forward it.
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:41:05

Exactly my thought. I think the main takeaway right now is this: at present miners have *no* disincentive to continually setting the fee bar higher and higher to include a transaction in a block -- the positive feedback mechanism to which I refer.
As far as I can see a dynamically-adjusting per-block difficulty based on fees is the only way to put a negative feedback mechanism in place.
Edit: of course this doesn't matter much now, as the block reward of new coins is what matters most to miners. In the future, when fees comprise the bulk of their reward, it will matter. The nice thing is that this proposal still works *right now* and in the future.

Henry Ford "revolutionized" labor relations when he created the $5 day. It was twice the going rate at a time (1913) when the dollar had been relatively stable for over 100 years.
So the going rate at the time was around $2.50 a day, not 10 cents. Today's value: $62.50 with **no income tax, no sales taxes, no social security and no medicare tax**. Ford raised that to $125 a day.

This is swatting a fly with a Buick.
All that is needed to facilitate O(1) propagation times is to forward blocks asynchronously. Once a valid block header (80 bytes) is received then start propagating it to one's peers rather than waiting for the entire list of transactions to arrive. This would require no protocol change and absolutely minimal coding to achieve.

You can't fix a price in Bitcoin at this time, as it isn't ubiquitously used as a store of value yet.

It's the "about the same time" which is the problem.
If Miner C gets A's first then that's the "winning" block, if it gets B's first then that one is.
Also, I'm not talking about sending headers only, I'm talking about starting transmission of the full block immediately -- transactions and all. Except that this transmission starts as soon as the header is received and verified, not once all the transactions have arrived.
In your proposal is there some mechanism that completely prevents orphans now? If not then "arriving at the same time" is still a problem regardless.
Because propagation of the block begins as soon as 80 bytes is received it's O(1) -- no matter how many transactions follow. A fully validating node simply confirms which block's transmission **started to be received** first, the other is orphaned. The beginning of the receipt of a valid header then acts like a kind of "placeholder" while we're waiting for the rest of the block to be sent. Because propagation time is drastically reduced across the network the likelihood of orphans is even less than at present.
What this means is that receipt of a 10GB block will be confirmed over a 10K block *as long as the header of the 10GB block was received first.*
There's no danger in starting to propagate blocks which are invalid because all their validity can be ascertained from the first-arriving header. Furthermore because miners have put the computing power into generating the block's hash they have no incentive to start broadcasting a valid block's header only then to withhold its transactions.
Edit: IOW I'm talking about relaying the exact same information that's relayed now, except rather than store-and-forward we start forwarding as soon as the first 80 bytes are received. Always O(1)

That's partially true. A sender can choose which fees to include, however no miner is obligated to include a transaction in a block.
Miners have costs and won't include transactions with fees that are too low for them to make a profit.
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:21:41
Not really. The amount sent in the first iteration won't be 5.1153 -- that amount won't show up until the last iteration. So you'd have to match the 10BTC to the *last* iteration's 5.1153BTC. And before you could do this you'd have to determine that the 4.8847BTC change amount shown in the first iteration was indeed a change address, not a final destination. If you can't do this you can't even know that you're looking for a 5.1153 transaction.

@_date: 2014-08-11 22:06:59
I'm talking about propagation times, not the efficiency of how we transmit the data. This is a separate issue and one which Gavin's current proposal addresses.
Let's say we have the topology where the connections are A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D (in this p2p network not every node connects to *every* other node so this is quite plausible). If I receive a 1GB block synchronously with each peer having a 100Mb connection it'll take 80 seconds * 3 = 240 seconds to propagate. A 1MB block will take 0.24 seconds.
This becomes *really striking* when we consider a network of, say, 7000 nodes each connected to 50 nodes, for example (kinda like what Bitcoin has). In that case we have around 140 (7000 / 50) serial forwards to do. A 1GB file will take 80 seconds * 140 = 3.1 hours to propagate! (The 1MB block will take around 12 seconds). With async forwarding we're still around the 80 second mark (plus 140 * whatever it takes to transmit 80 bytes).
This is the essence of the proposal.

Furthermore I'm not talking about tax *evasion*, I'm talking about a tax *revolt*. Learn the difference. Evasion is uncommon and easily punished; a revolt is widespread and is beyond control. If your statement is true, and a vast majority see the benefit of paying taxes then my point is moot; if, however, people pay their taxes simply because they're scared of men with guns coming to their door then my point may have some validity.
If I'm wrong and those who *produce* (not leech) love paying taxes then none of this will happen. Otherwise you'd better get busy -- you aren't going to have a sugar daddy government to take care of you any more.

This incentive decreases as the block reward decreases.
A vicious miner filling up blocks with zero-fee transactions will lose economically (i.e. transaction fees) to the miner mining the same-sized block with valid transactions.
Furthermore, even now, a miner filling blocks with useless transactions risks their block being orphaned to a smaller, valid block.

Blockchain pruning solves this problem. We don't need to keep "terabytes" of data but rather UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) which, even today, are a small subset of the total blockchain size.
Not sure if you've noticed but every transaction has inputs *and* outputs. Once inputs (former outputs) are spent they no longer need to be kept after enough confirmations. Large transactions which result in two outputs (a payee and change) will increase the blockchain size while consolidation of small inputs (consolidating change) will result in reducing the blockchain size. So, you see, the blockchain won't keep growing forever but will achieve a size which relates directly to the number of unspent outputs.
Much of the data in the blockchain right now is legacy and not needed.
Again, you don't understand the technology. In fact, your grasp of it is so tenuous that you think that **I** don't understand it.

The block header has *all* the information required to verify it. No transactions necessary. That's why the merkle tree was selected -- it allows one to prune *all* the transactions from a block eventually leaving only the block header. You seem to be under the impression that the entire block must be downloaded in order to verify its validity. Not true.
So if the block header is invalid it doesn't ever matter if transactions are forwarded.
The block header is around 80 bytes.
@_date: 2015-05-31 04:02:37
Ug, forgot about  Oh well, back to the drawing board.
BTW, why is it that block size seems to be a problem that's argued from both sides? That is: A/ miners mine smaller blocks so they don't get orphaned; B/ miners will mine super huge blocks to spam the network.
A/ to me seems to be valid and would bring block sizes, in the absence of a hard limit and a decreasing block reward, to some type of economic equilibrium -- miners would weigh transaction fees lost against the possibility of being orphaned.
Edit: And, why is there so much effort spent trying to mitigate the economic disadvantages of poorly-connected miners while miners with lower hash rates aren't given this same consideration? :) I.e. if a miner can't afford more hashing power then too bad, but if he can't afford a better Internet connection then shit let's write code!

Not at all. I believe that people don't really consider this possibility because the vast majority don't even know what a tax revolt is. This is due to the fact that most are tax serfs rather than taxpayers (i.e. taxes are taken off their pay before they even receive it).
There is a *massive* difference between tax evasion and a tax revolt. I believe a revolt won't take place in small steps, but rather once Crypto-money becomes popular it will flash through the population in a very short time.
For the government tax evasion is easy to investigate and punish. A tax revolt, however, is completely untenable.

Is this the case with Mycelium Gear?
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:12:03
Not true. Pruning stabilizes the blockchain to a given size, which is determined by the amount of unspent outputs.
Every bitcoin transaction consists of inputs and outputs. When an input is spent and buried under enough blocks it can be discarded. So unless every bitcoin transaction resulted in more outputs than inputs the blockchain size would stabilize.
Furthermore as outputs decrease in value there is some incentive to consolidate multiple inputs into a smaller amount of outputs, which would result in a decrease of the blockchain size.

You're kinda missing the point. The larger the block a miner pushes to the network, the higher the probability that it will be orphaned. Therefore publishing larger blocks is not in a miner's economic interest *unless* the transaction fees of the larger block make up for the probability of being orphaned.
This means that, economically, worrying about miners publishing spam blocks is unfounded. It is not in their economic interest to do so.

Not true. Gavin's solution is O(n/m) where m is the multiple of the increased efficiency in which blocks are propagated. He is making the transfer of transactions *more efficient* which is great, but he's not making propagation time O(1).
Unless he has some structure in place which can hold an infinite amount of information in a fixed space. And even then the fixed space would be much larger than 80 bytes and propagation would be slower than async forwarding, therefore increasing the occurrence of orphaned blocks.
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:32:35

Yes, it can function as a currency without increasing in value significantly.

Wrong. Value comes from *any* reason to use the money -- whether this is transactional use or store-of-value use. *Any* use adds value.

I think we're talking past each other a bit.
My point is that there are mechanisms currently in place to prevent memory pools being hammered with spam transactions. This being the case why have a block size limit at all?
Like I said, I suspect the block size limit is in place because of propagation problems with larger blocks, not because of any spamming concern. And block propagation is a separate issue -- solve the block propagation problem and there's no need for any limits on block sizes because the rules don't allow transaction spam in the first place.

@_date: 2014-08-07 22:46:37
The technical hurdles really aren't very large. Just have to start tracking in which block an output was spent so that an expiry mechanism can be implemented. My personal opinion is that the amount of blocks under which a spent output is buried should probably be something that the end user should be able to set.
Some might want to keep spent outputs for 1,000,000 blocks, some might only want 10,000 blocks some want it all. Then blockchain size is almost directly controlled by the person running the node.

It's disheartening that both segregated witness and lightning network are cited as solutions to the "technical limitations" of Bitcoin.
First, while the limitations are "technical" they're certainly not theoretical; second, the solution is much simpler than SW or LN: removal of the block limit.

I suppose this *could* be the case, but in the majority will not be true.

You're right -- was using "public keys" instead of "addresses."

It used to be that the least value one could spend in the US (a penny) was the equivalent of a quarter. "Five and dimes" were actually the dollar stores of the day. Pennies, nickels and dimes today are useless. Imagine only getting quarters as change!

2/ Impost quotas on Bitcoin send abroad -&gt; how the hell do they do this?? :);
3/ (possibly) shut down exchanges entirely -&gt; Millions of profit-hungry entrepreneurs with Bitcoin on their smartphones flood the country, eager to sell to Chinese seeking to abandon their sinking currency;
4/ The **real boom** is going to come when the Chinese (or any other, for that matter) learn that Bitcoin is a store of value, not simply a transfer mechanism to avoid capital controls;

Bitcoin *completely resists regulation*. If this is what's required for it to "grow up" (it's not) then it will stay an infant forever.

In the case two blocks are solved at the same time some nodes accept one, some the other. The "real" chain emerges once a miner builds on one or the other.
Same idea here -- if one node rejects a block and another doesn't and that block is extended the node that rejected it then accepts it since it has been built upon.
This was explained in another thread. Sorry you're so busy and smart you didn't get a chance to read it.

I'm not sure this matters. Other miners would have their own mempools and would reject the bloated block.
Setting up malicious nodes which didn't reject blocks in this way would simply effect to have the malicious miner own a fork of Bitcoin.

I've been arguing this for months. :/ I've been told over and over that economic incentives don't matter to malicious miners.
So then why the need for a block size limit? I understand that we're programming for what *can* happen rather than what *probably will* happen, so the block limit remains.
Regardless of whether this solution is elegant or correct or not, I think that, somehow, the fact that a bloated block will contain a large percentage of transactions that *no other node* has in its mempool may be exploited somehow to prevent this type of malicious behavior without the need for a block limit.

I think you misunderstand how this would work for the "broken" node. The block would be rejected by the broken node *until* it saw that another block had been mined on the rejected block. It would then realize that the network had accepted the broken block and include it -- the broken node would have consensus with the rest of the network again.
A reminder: one set of nodes can have a different "consensus" than another set of nodes. This happens when two blocks are mined simultaneously. Once the *next* block is mined consensus is achieved once more and the loser block is orphaned.
This proposal would work the same way, except one set of nodes would have an accepted block and another set wouldn't, until the nodes that didn't confirm the block see another block mined on it.

If (when) Bitcoin transaction rates flash 100x in a year, two or three then a 16MB block size will be completely inadequate.
I'm not saying that this will happen within a given time period. What I am saying is that block size, if it's to be constrained, cannot have it's requirement easily predicted; it's quite like mining hashing rate. Hence the requirement for some type of feedback mechanism. Unfortunately, unlike block difficulty, this would necessitate a positive rather than negative feedback mechanism which introduces its own set of problems.
@_date: 2015-07-30 06:35:17
This is all well and good as long as the adoption rate of Bitcoin doesn't  become extreme. In that case all bets are off, and the desire for underpowered nodes to continue their involvement will be moot. The hampering effect of an inadequate block maximum size will then still, however, negatively affect the network of properly-equipped nodes in non-trivial ways.

Of course the price matters. Bitcoin has a fixed supply; its price, therefore, dictates its utility.

If I'd bought $15k worth then, they'd be worth $660,000 now.

That makes no sense at all. If the price is too low it limits the amount I can send. So the magnitude of "some amount of value" depends directly on the price.
If the price is too low I can't transfer the value. Sure, the network still "works", but it's useless.
So it doesn't "work" if the price is too low and you're talking about utility.

Bitcoins didn't even have any worth at first. In order for Satoshi to pull "shenanigans" he'd have to broadcast his longer chain when bitcoins had some worth.
But by the time bitcoins had worth the mining community would have *surely* collectively outpaced any chain he made.
I mean, he could have pre-mined 500,000 blocks for all we know -- but they wouldn't be accepted by the network if he broadcast them now.

At a certain level the bubble becomes self-reinforcing. This occurs when national currencies start to become weakened by speculative attacks of Bitcoin buyers. At that point few will want to "cash out" their (ever increasing) bitcoins for their (every decreasing) national currency.

FOMO will kick in soon enough and we'll see a bit of a vertical. But the real explosion will occur when Bitcoin begins to affect national currencies.
Speculative currency attacks aren't solely the purview of institutional traders. Regular folks unwittingly weaken their own currencies when they sell them for Bitcoins. A positive feedback loop will establish which will take Bitcoin into the stratosphere, leaving a wake of fatally damaged currencies behind -- first the weak, then the strong.

The problem with posts like this one is that the OP imagines governments to be all-seeing, all-powerful entities. They're not.
If the people decide to use Bitcoin it will be used. Governments are good at punishing a few to make examples. They are totally helpless when a majority of the populace decides to ignore them.
The huge difference this time is that, unlike prohibition or the drug war, if the people decide to use Bitcoin and participate in a widespread tax revolt the governments of the world, annoyed as they may be, will be financially decimated.

Privacy means nothing, it is the non-confiscatable nature of Bitcoin that makes it revolutionary. Furthermore, for the first time in history we have an asset that cannot be seized but retains its utility: one can still transact at a distance.
Once the masses use Bitcoin enough, and the value of fiat has imploded, then governments (indeed, any nefarious agents) will need to *fund* their activities with Bitcoin. They need money for surveillance, agents, courts, vehicles, jails, etc.

100Mbit is sufficient for 26K transactions/sec -- assuming 8 upstream nodes and *all* of them requiring those transactions be forwarded that allows for 3K transactions/sec to be forwarded.
A 100Mbit connection for a data center is trivial -- 1Gbit and up is common even today. And there are literally *hundreds of thousands* of entities in the world that have the resources (and, indeed, the future incentive) to provision this sort of service.

I'm not sure this is an issue. I currently have 20Mbit upstream on my home connection. This is enough bandwidth to supply 6 other nodes with around 1K transactions/sec.
Even a *modest* data center node would be able to handle thousands of transactions per second.
Furthermore, as adoption grows, large companies will have an incentive to run their own well-connected nodes in order to detect double-spends. There will be *tens of thousands* of adequately-provisioned nodes in an adoption scenario.

You need to do your homework. :)
A transaction's validity can be determined by the merkle tree for a block. SPV clients use the block headers to determine longest chain (by work) and use merkle trees to determine a transaction's validity.

Mining does *not* turn power into truth. In fact, miners can put anything they want into a block they solve, true or not.
Consensus between nodes establishes truth, proof-of-work simply ensures that the consensus agreed upon in the past can't be rewritten without expending more energy than it took to establish.

I think scaling the blocksize before implementing transaction pruning is putting the cart before the horse.
Once pruning is implemented the blockchain's size achieves a steady-state size -- increasing (and decreasing!) based on the number and size of transactions.
After pruning is implemented the best algorithm for the block maximum size would be one that, like the difficulty adjustment, uses previous recent-history block sizes to dynamically set a maximum future block size.

Some nodes may *decide* to keep the whole history, but there is no *need* to keep the whole history. Once an output is spent and buried under enough blocks there is practically no difference between that output being unspendable and that output never existing.
Block headers are trivial to store. Each 40 bytes or so, IIRC, a full year's block headers can be stored in 2.1Mbytes. 100 years' block headers would take 210MBytes to store.
The block header has *all* the information needed to determine total work expended and, therefore, the best fork. The merkle tree determines a *transaction's validity in the block*, not the other way around.

The honesty of the chain can be determined by *block headers only* -- the only reason to keep a record of a spent output is for internal bookkeeping (i.e. it was your transaction).

Early adopters will see their bitcoin stash go up in value which creates a "wealth effect."

Greed is what makes the price of bitcoins go up. The reason that the price is going down isn't greed, it's fear.
As the ecosystem develops the greed/fear cycle will continue -- at some point in the future when Bitcoin reaches its full potential greed/fear will disappear as Bitcoin will be as familiar as dollars.
Of course, once Bitcoin reaches its full potential it will also be the early greedy participants that are rewarded.

The real value in the Merkle tree is its ability to be "pruned" whilst still allowing the verification of still-existing branches.
