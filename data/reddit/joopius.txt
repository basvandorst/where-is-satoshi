I don't know that it will free him completely, but what _may_ happen is that the judge will declare it a mistrial due to the fact key evidence was omitted or not admissible in court at the time. Then there will be separate trials. One again for Ross w/ new evidence, one for Force, one for Bridges. I highly doubt Ross will be exonerated whether he was a patsy or not. As far as I know, their whole goal was to prove he was DPR, when in fact DPR could have been someone else or multiple people. Heck, it could have even been Force or Bridges!

Based on Marks follow ups and responses to some of the allegations against him, I am not nor was I ever convinced he has that money. You think he stole all this money from the exchange and continue to talk to us? Kimble and Verto didn't. Josh Garza is nowhere to be found. Mark is the patsy in this scheme. If the DEA stole the coins it will come to light. I'm not saying Mark didn't make mistakes, he certainly did and he learned a thing or two. But he's still a human being, and I think people are making assumptions about his integrity. Yes many people are salty he caused them losses, but what would you have done in his shoes? It's not like any situation like the one at gox happened previously in history with the worlds largest exchange going under. Also, consider his life now: he was part of a global conspiracy and had to defend himself and his actions, people made assumptions based on his actions and could not share the full story, making him look like a fool that lost millions of dollars. Based on his actions and the fact he is still talking to makes me think he to some extent was ostracized because his immediate actions and statements in the matter were out of his hands to some degree. Say what you want about Mark Kerboppeles but I don't think he is a criminal who made off with people's money like the Agents involved, Garza, Kimble/Verto or that Thomas boob groper guy. Because fuck them.

Sometimes this happens when reporting real time data if services crash or need to be restarted. They likely lost the connection to the source they were using to report the data on the chart real time and didn't have a backup. Or a cruel April fools joke.

Remember when the Internet first came out? Smartphones? In 2006 you didn't know that everyone in 2015 would own a smartphone did you? If you told your 2006 friends smartphones are what everyone will have im the future they would have had the same reaction. I get the same shit all the time. I usually explain to people that in 5 to 10 years this is how people will transact. People in general don't get it right now, but it's like explaining what computers are and how they will change the world in the 1960's. People at that time didn't know what a computer was much less how to use one. On another note, credit cards were invented in the 50s. We still use them today. The future doesn't have credit cards at all. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they became obsolete in the next 10 years and everyone transacted with Bitcoin.

I think I should point out that Mark Karpeles would likely himself admit that his security was "meager at best," you have to remember that they were the  exchange at that time, which would have meant that they were a target for criminals in general, particularly around the time that the price of bitcoin exploded. I myself never, ever believed that Mark was 100% to blame for what happened, despite the lack of security. He basically took the fall for his company amid corruption and scandal, and essentially got the brunt of the blame, along with a lot of very angry bitcoin investors, some of whom lost a LOT of money. After this series of events, I have no doubt that the majority of people will reconsider how they feel towards Karpeles, and realize that he is not solely to blame for the Mt Gox collapse. Things like Willy bot and PR surrounding the issue at the time are obviously a whole other story, and I'm not exactly saying that Karpeles didn't make mistakes... but I really don't believe he is a malicious person out to screw people over like many make him out to be. He was pretty much the "fall guy" and the face of Mt Gox, whom people were angry with. But because he didn't have any information to prove otherwise, he now has to deal with not "being able to visit parks" and public scrutiny wherever he goes, for a long time, if not the rest of his life.

These are all great points, I think that since its not currently set up it would probably take a week or so. If we got it set up, we would be able to handle it if it were needed in less time. Possibly 24 hours, depending on the length of time it takes for the client to obtain coins.

No we do have methods of payment, it's just that these guys didn't have a credit card, and they could only do a wire transfer and we couldn't restore their service until they paid, where the wire transfer would have taken four days. I think with paypal it's less time, maybe 1-3 business days.

This is a total wash. It's a propaganda piece. They're doing the old Nancy Grace tactic by throwing in child abuse in there. "Think of the children!" 
Bitcoin has nothing to do with child abuse, but now, thanks to this article in Forbes, a source that likely has more non-bitcoin users than those that do, people are going to associate bitcoin with child porn.

This same thing happened to my co-worker. It took him 2 weeks but Coinbase finally honored his purchase of 5BTC at the price he got it at, which today would equate to +$60 more per coin. I know people say don't use coinbase but their customer service is actually really good, case in point, justin_coinbase.

Isn't it more of a risk to hold? If you use it for transactions only, it's slightly different than accepting and holding.

Someone at work compared it to WoW gold. It is the same concept. It's digital currency. Blizzard is using the technology in their own environment but the open source was developed specifically for them. It will be interesting to see some of those results because they can track where and how every bit/unit is spent.

I'm not sure that I agree with "few merchants accept this," there are many merchants that accept it these days. Also, it's not really that difficult to get bitcoins. Depending on where you get them from, companies like Coinbase and Circle make it easy and fast.
