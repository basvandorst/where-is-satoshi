They creating coin for themselves. Bitcoin is not like cash its more like bitfinex/tether toy. Taking all the money from crypto with fake money :)

It will not. They can block btc today and tomorrow will be dead. BTC not threat to governments or banks. Normal people and companys will not use btc. If someone steal money banks may recover the money. How to do this in crypto ? What about sending wrong address ? Banks can recover crypto can't. 
Not just this. Money in the crypto over 80% is Bitfinex/Tether fake scam money. 
You guys just reaming... Some day all of you will understand.
