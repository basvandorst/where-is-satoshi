No, they really meant buy. The price of BCH shot up to 9k within minutes because of high demand and low supply. They then had to freeze trading because it was out of control.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:21:53
It was only a glitch in so far as orders were freezes in post only mode before the gates were opened. According to Coinbase, it was the intended launch procedure. Whether or not it was a good procedure is another story. The ensuing chaos speaks for itself, IMO.
The order books were very real though, I watched live supply and demand accumulate on both side. Then price climbing steadily and quickly once the trade engine started matching them.

Thanks for the reply, you bring good arguments to the table. 


I haven't looked for it, but closest I've seen is [this tweet from ViaBTC]( about possible smart contract integration. However, it seems coherent with the big blockers' stance that scaling can be handle by block size alone. I haven't been convinced of the contrary, yet. It's hard to get a good conversation started on the subject on here without getting bashed, and the folks would give me a biased opinion. I like to hear what all sides have to say.
What I think know for sure is that the LN 2nd layer solution leads to natural monopolies in the hub space. The rate of centralization in that case is inversely correlated with 1st layer fees. I'd be happy to elaborate on that if you want.
LN centralization is more worrying to me than the possibility of mining centralization, which itself does not present a blatant network effect. Luke Jr asking people if they want to lower blocksize to 300kb on twitter is not reassuring either.


I'm too new to the scene to have been properly aware of that. From what I gather however, it seems like it was the only way to bring about big blocks.


I'll admit the relation BCH has with Segwit makes me uneasy, given the existence of ABC tech in mining gear made by Bitmain. A monopoly on efficient gear is a bad thing.


Comes down to whether bigger blocks is a sufficient solution for now. Personally, I don't think mining centralization is a big problem since there is not a huge barrier to entry. Perhaps its a good reason to fight together for better internet access in the world. Telecom monopolies are a big problem, and we'll have to eventually transition to a meshnet/internet dual architecture to bring down the price of bandwidth and force the hand of corporations.
Cheers.

@_date: 2017-08-17 18:02:35


I think you're right. And LN can lead to multiple hubs if the on chain fees stay reasonable. It's a matter of balance. 
I've bought into the narrative that there is strong influence from groups for the main chain to keep on chain transactions at a minimum, implying high fees. If you want to discuss that, I'd love to. I don't really know the political side of bitcoin really well, so all input is welcome.
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:56:14
Because large exchange hubs are an easy target for lawmakers. Just look at all the current exchanges we deal with, most of them comply with KYC and AML. What makes you think lightning hubs would be an exception?
Lawmakers aside, owners of the hub as could decide to not process transactions that they do not approve of. They'd have the power to do so.

It does not compute for me. Where are the exchanges going to get the bitcoins they need to match up the input from a new user? It represents huge amounts of bitcoins. And if any one hub has enough bitcoins to symmetrically match all of its users' worth in bitcoins, then I'd be very worried about the proper distribution. In the limit case, if we end up with only one major hub, that means it would hold over half of the total bitcoins in circulation. Problematic much?

You're right, businesses could be targeted for regulation. However, they can only refuse to accept your payment, not censor you. See the wikileak case, where CC companies (central hubs) stopped them from receiving donations.


The problem is that hubs have a huge entry barrier, which creates a monopoly. Whichever alternative hubs exist will have less and smaller channels. If they gain a reputation for allowing 'unlawful' transaction, they might get blacklisted, making them unable to interact to mainstream regulated hubs. Then, it'd be just another step for regulated hubs to refuse channeling from an address that had recently dealt with a blacklisted hub.


The peer-to-peer, decentralized nature of on-chain transaction makes it much harder to target with regulation. Authorities have to resort to targeting entities on the periphery of the blockchain (exchanges, businesses). Unless there came to pass a global law affecting all major mining pools (unlikely for the moment), then there is no way to control transactions.


The hub ecosystem is highly subject to the networking effect. It leads to natural monopoly, in the same manner that the telecom industry does. Have a look at how [it gets broken by antitrust and recentralizes]( in the last 30-ish years.

You just strawman'd me hard, but I'll take the bait this once. You're right aobut Gavin, I don't really follow the dev scene so I don't know who's who, I dont know why I assumed he was lead dev. Thanks for pointing that out.


Why must I? We can open another argument if you want, but we're having a discussion about hub centralization here. Are they mutually exclusive? Do LN prevent mining centralization? 




I remember seeing a tweet from a dev about it. But I can't find it.
Anyway, let's try to keep a civil and intellectually honest debate. I've been hanging on which apparently has a strong counter-narrative not agreed on here, so that may explain to you some on the information Im propagating.

@_date: 2017-08-22 19:20:04
Thanks for the reply!


I agree, censorship is valuable.


 Agreed. Certainly the average will be over 1 channel per user. It depends on 1st layer fees. 
I'm just worried that we might not have the right mechanisms in place in the end to find a proper equilibrium. In the end, I think we can both agree the price of censorship-resistance is proportional to 1st layer fees. I don't want the community to be pushed into a direction where those are kept high to push people onto 2nd layer. I think most movements that could benefit from censorship resistance are often on the lower side of the inequality curve as they run against the establishment; they are the least likely to be able to consistently afford the high cost of avoiding censorship. Take the Bitcoin community opposing the big banks as an example.


So only half the fees to open. That's interesting and good to know!
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:24:04
You should explain bitcoin to newcomers as multiple chain rather than one. It's safer for new arrivants to buy an equal share into each fork when buying in to avoid this kind of thing. Unfortunately, its not a common conception around here. People say there is only The Bitcoin and forks are alts. But its foolish to discard the risk that one chain overcomes the other. We need a Bitcoin Tree Index or something.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:13:01
So what are the actual use cases? Sounds to me like people will want to open only one channel with a single lightning hub to minimize transactions on the main chain, because of high fees and small mempool.

They reflect my reasoning backed by my technical understanding of systems in general. Granted, you have no reason to believe I have any expertise on the matter, but that's something else entirely.
Also, I don't know what he means when he says he's okay with it. Is it because he does not care about the fate of Core Bitcoin? Or because he likes centralization? I don't know the guy much.

Actually, most the major exchanges support it, including but not limited to Kraken, Bittrex, Poloniex and BitFinex. Also, the recent rally has seen the price of BCH relative to BTC double.

@_date: 2017-08-17 14:26:13
Glad you asked! I've been having that debate and promoting this point of view for about a week now, so I'll happily share what I know.
I think you're right about LN enabling TOR-like behavior. I can see there being two types of tx routes, the 'greedy' type and the 'private' type. The latter is you proposed about maximizing hops to improve tx privacy. The 'greedy' tx route would rather seek to minimize cost.
However, the greedy routing algorithm, which we could reasonably assume will govern a sizeable fraction of all transactions, would foster a network dynamic in which we converge towards a hub monopoly. It's a textbook case of networking effect. [Other people have come to the same conclusion](
Mechanistically, its all pretty simple. I provided further explanation in a previous post:


It's a winner-take-all dynamic on a global economic scale.
Moreover, if transactions are not themselves symmetrical (input approx. equal to output), then the channel needs to be settled. This dynamic also promotes having a single middleman. That is because, in the average case, for someone who's income equals his spending, equilibrium is guaranteed. The law of large numbers applies since a single channel would connect you to everyone other possible person you would want to transact with. One would only ever have to settle if the variance of their transaction size increases, i.e., they have upward economical mobility and they are able to afford more costly goods more often. And I just realized this as I write it; scarily enough, such a dynamic puts a price on increasing one's purchasing power. 
A lot of it comes down to the blocksize. Big 1st layer fee would mean big hubs, whereas small fees would enable a plethora of small hubs and the desirable TOR behavior.
Edit: removed wrong assumption about Gavin and unbacked claim about Blockstream, thanks to for pointing that out.
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:49:05
Who will they credit, though? Most people were presumably hedging their longs through poloniex by borrowing at the time of the fork, because they said their policy would be BCH-agnostic and thus borrowers would not incur a dividend loss (the BCH airdrop) from shorting. The lending interest rates spiked to 5%/day on the 31st because of this. Meanwhile, they also stated they would not credit lenders either. Most of the bitcoins that did not stay on the platform for a juicy lending payday went to greener pastures to ensure they benefit from the fork (wallet or other exchanges). That leaves little people actually holding BTC on poloniex that may get credited.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:49:38
I think it's LN hubs; they benefit from the network effect while mining does not. It's inherently a winner-take-all system.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:32:10
It's a good idea to hold equal amounts of BCH and BTC if you want to be safe.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:43:11
This. I tried to explain it in another thread:


@_date: 2017-08-15 14:37:07


It's a wonderful thought to think the routing algorithms would allow to maximize hops count for privacy purposes. Makes me think of tor.


I can see there being two types of tx routes, the 'greedy' type and the 'private' type. The latter is you proposed about maximizing hops to improve tx privacy. The 'greedy' tx route would rather seek to minimize cost. 
By design, the greedy routing algorithm, which we could reasonably assume will govern a sizeable fraction of all transactions, would foster a network dynamic in which we converge towards a hub monopoly.


You would in effect need to own &gt;50% of all coins to open a symmetrical channel with all other bitcoins holders. While it may seem like a lot, bitcoin has a very tame inflation curve (converging to no inflation at all). Running a hub grants riskless income proportional to the number of channels, thus to the amount of coins you can chip in. It behaves very similarly to an interest rate on your capital in that the income is directly proportionnal to your capital. Noted, we have to take into account some variance because the payout is not constant in time, it depends on users' tx count. So, we have a mechanism that allows participants to earn interest on their capital on an arguably deflationary currency. Point is, given enough time, it may be possible to see a single entity possess that many bitcoins.


The answer is probably a mix of both of those things. There's money to be made both as a market maker with that much supply and as a transaction middleman. Different risks, different rewards.

I'm not sure what you mean here. If we take the wikileaks example again, payment was censored because it went through a centralized hub. Bitcoin allowed to bypass that.
 &gt; As I said, you can just choose another hub that will transfer your money.
I agree that in the context of multiple hubs that are regulated differently, this is possible. With that said, my argument is contingent on the system converging toward a single big hub.




Not if it is cost-prohibitive to do so.


One option is more encompassing than the other, especially as hubs tend toward centralization, therein lies the danger.


Networking effect means you can't meaningfully compete unless your resources are as great as the biggest actor. That's what it means. It's a winner-takes-all dynamic. There is no economic incentive to connect to a small hub.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:29:30


Mining is still by far the least centralized aspect of Bitcoin when we [look at the data]( It's a long read, but it's worth it to at least skip to the most relevant figures, particularly [this one]( Adding a touch of irony, the most centralized aspect right now is the codebase.
Of course, this does not completely discredit the claim that mining is getting *more* centralized as time goes. I don't have any data regarding that. It'd be naive to think Asicboost is the epitome of ASIC improvement, though. It's just the current state of the art. 
Personally, I think we should let the mining pools compete on their own. Nothing is stopping them from starting research coalitions. A succesful IP licensed to contributing lesser pools would shift the current hash distribution. In a worst case scenario, the PoW can be changed to restart mining distribution and research race.

I think both BCH and LN are good things. Luckily, they are compatible. I want to see a lot of low fee hubs emerge, which would not have happened under Core watch. If that happens, hubs can serve to route a transaction with increased privacy, à la Tor network.

If that's what you think, what ais your stance on the centralization of bitcoin under a LN second layer?
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:50:46


Have faith, I can prove it. Reasonably well, that is :p. Going to work with and rephrase most of the arguments I've already used in other threads.
First, let's clarify the main assumption of my argumentation which is high on-chain fees. I posit that the higher the 1st layer fees, the higher the rate of hub centralization. I don't want to debate whether or not there is an agenda to push people onto second layer with high fees, as that is another matter entirely.
Secondly, we need to make sure we understand that an effective channel is contingent on its transactional symmetry. I.E., input is roughly equal to output through time. That is because channels have a limited capacity and can dry up, requiring settlement when they do. We could model one's transactions as a gaussian process (normal distribution through time). If a channel is big enough to encompass the variance of the cumulative transactions with a high probability, then one can minimize the probability of having to settle on the main chain. 
In layman's terms, this means that your channel has to be big enough to encompass your shopping spree as well as high income events (although the latter are often more regular through time, unless you win the lotto).
Now, let's ask what happens when on-chain fees are high. It is self-evident that we then want to minimize channel settling. And how do we optimize in that manner? By routing the biggest amount of transactions possible through one solo channel. [The law of large numbers]( dictate that over a large enough amount of events, the average will tend towards the expected value (in our case, 0 given someone who spends as much as he gets paid). So, for any given node (be it a end user or a hub), there is a premium on opening more than one channel because the transactional average may exceed the capacity and force a settlement.
If we accept the above, then it results that any given user is economically incentivized to connect to one and only one hub. So how does this further warrant centralization?
I think it is a given that hubs will charge fees to let transactions through. We know that channels require both parties to chip in an equal amount of coins to open. This means that in order to create a hub, someone must sacrifice coins that he might otherwise use to increase his own transactional capacity, increasing the probability that he has to settle and thus costing him money. Follows that, if an end-user wants to minimize fees, he is incentivized to minimize hops between hubs. One does that by connecting to the largest possible hub that can guarantee the least average amount of hops to reach any given user.
Unrelated to centralization, I'd like to point out that such a network puts a price on purchasing power by limiting the amount that a user can spend at any given time. Thus, even if you have savings, you couldn't purchase expensive goods all at once, you'd have to either increase your channel capacity (immediately costly) or get financed. It is possible that it might incentivize credit for low income people, contributing to inequalities and yada yada. We know what credit does in our fiat economy, I don't imagine it's going to be much better in one that is deflationary.
Anyway, that's what I have so far. Hope I could help your thinking process. Cheers.

Bitcoin is still a good store of value, but people should be careful post-fork that they do not buy only one chain but all the possible chains to hedge their bets.

Edit: I forgot to pay heed to the fact you said my statement is blatant misinformation. That's a rather aggressive statement.

It does not happen at a loss, mining is already more profitable on the BCH chain. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:13:25


Doing so considerably increases your chances of having to settle. That's because your tx distribution on each channel will all have the same variance, but smaller capacity. We get that result by [solving for a mixture model]( with zero centered gaussians.


It has to be calculated into the fee nevertheless. Each hub a tx hops through takes its cut. In a space where competition is global, hubs will be incentivized to offer the best possible fees, charging less than the alternative to attract more customers. 


I can accept that.


I agree, you only need one channel. I never said the contrary though, so I'm not sure whats your point here.


Again, I disagree on this one point. Every intermediary takes its cut. Opening a channel costs capital. Why would a hub let a transaction pass through freely?
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:32:52
Thanks for the reply. Let me get this straight, though; if people collect fees for routing for letting transactions hop through their channels, then isn't this a case of a winner-take-all market? Hubs with the most channels can offer the cheapest fees since we can suppose fees are correlated with the number of channels a tx must go through (inversely correlated with hub size).

@_date: 2017-11-11 13:28:30
Comes a time when you must reevaluate the proposition of the assets you're holding. Memes and "HODL" mentality only get you so far. Businesses deem BTC is devalued to them right now, and see what's happening.

Then you should understand profitability for a piece of equipment is inversely correlated with mining efficiency. Point is, electricity consumption of the network will follow the reward curve, so efficiency is a non-factor.

Both have their merits. I saw some guy claim that either one of those two forks must be wrong and the other right. Truth is, nothing is binary in life, they are just two different implementations of Bitcoin. That's all.
Edit: grammar.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:17:03


And see, thats where they are wrong. Businesses NEED fast and cheap Bitcoin until layer 2 solutions are there. Their survival depends on it.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:47:12
Indirectly, it seems so. But miners still veto any protocol change.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:30:56
How does being a moderator influence his message? Anyone can start such a thread. What about the admins over here who heavily cens*r any conversation about BCH? They might end up making all the people over here bag holders. Who's abusing power?
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:11:59
Bitcoin "upgraded" to ASIC because mining is an arms race. It has nothing to do will tx throughput at all.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:15:56


This is so obviously propaganda. What IS the barrier to TPS if it's not blocksize?


Why not limit the blocks to 1kB then? No more spam! /s


This is not about the coffee use case anymore. Practically any small scale commerce is untenable because of the high fees and slow confirmations.

You guys are deluded if you think BCH excludes any possibility of layer 2 dev.

Hedging doesn't have to hurt your profit potential, though. You can hedge by diversifying across uncorrelated assets that you believe all have good growth prospects.

Except that Bitcoin is clearly a system wherein people vote with their hash power. There's no such thing as "one person, one vote" in cryptoland.

If you mean different from Bitcoin Core, yes. Of course it's slightly different, otherwise it wouldn't be a fork. With that said, Core does not dictate what defines the Bitcoin protocol. No one does, that's the beauty of it.

Yea... no. The moderation logs at are open, go have a look at them. Views are not censored, and the admin promotes whatever view he wants on equal footing with everyone else.
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:24:31
Don't do it, you'd expose yourself to additional risk if you do. BCH is currently focused on increased adoption and scaling. It may rise in value during the incoming fork drama, and the possibility that it displaces the other forks still exists.

You know perfectly well what I'm talking about, no need to dummy up in denial.
I'm talking about the many Bitcoin forks, not altcoins. You know the ones. You shouldn't have the control to decide the conversation like that to favorite your favorite fork, it's unhealthy. However, I understand why you wouldn't want to give that up, since it is a lot of power.
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:19:17
I'm sorry, I don't follow your answer. Did you mean to post it in reply to one of the subthreads? And you say you don't agree with trusting devs?
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:55:06
This. It's also why it's important that the main subreddits do not try to control the conversation, personal interests should not get in the way of information.
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:46:05
Ah, my bad, I meant straw man. BCH is unrelevant here. Again, this thread is about who governs the Bitcoin discussion and how it is done, not about any given fork. It's 100% related to Bitcoin. Here's an example of the problem:


Here, you insinuate all forks are altcoins. You're going to govern the discussion on this sub on that basis. What if a people disagree with you, in the past, present or future? Are you going to prevent their voice from being heard? 
What if you and the other mods find themselves supporters of Gold in a few months, are you going to change your mind on hardforks? Can't you see the ethical problem this poses, being able to push the narrative in your favor?


And in the meantime, newcomers still find this subreddit first. As the one of the main contender for Bitcoin public forums, you have a duty to let the conversation be free from constraints and covert control.
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:23:38
Most of these things make a lot of sense to me as well.


While I think it's great to have good devs, I like to remind myself to not blindly trust them, or anyone for that matter. Ideally, devs could operate in a trustless environment as well. I stumbled upon [this chart]( over a month ago that shows how the code repo is the most centralized aspect of Bitcoin. Link to the whole article [here]( It's a 12m read but its very well written, I recommend it.


I still can't seem to find a footing in the Segwit vs no-Segwit debate. I agree that fixing transaction malleability is great, but there's apparently a flipside to it as well, and it's hard to find objective material that examines both the pros and cons.
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:26:20
What about private property? Do you enforce land ownership with your own private militia? Could get feudal really quickly!
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:25:03
So, basically, total work done, is that right?
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:40:41
There seems to be a strong trust in the devs in this community. It is a peculiar thing given one of the most important value in Bitcoin is trustlessness. Why do you think people defer more easily to the expertise of the Bitcoin devs than they would for other experts (financial experts, for example XD)?
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:34:49
Don't stray man the conversation. This is not about any one fork. Not going down that rabbit hole with you. This is about the mods (including you) having veto power you shouldn't have over the Bitcoin narrative. You haven't been elected to do so.
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:22:02


Yes, you are talking in circles as well from my point of view. At least we can both agree that this is waste of time.


Well, at least you clarified what an altcoin is to you, great. We at least achieved this much in our conversation. Doesn't mean I agree with that definition, though. Moreover, I don't agree that you in particular should get to define what is an altcoin. That's the whole point of this thread from the start.


Sure, corporate control is bad. However, I personally think their interest align with the users there. Less fees and more adoptions means more stability. What's not to love about that? 
In the end though, what saddens me is that in the war for the Bitcoin trademark, you poisoned your own well. By refusing to give credibility to minority forks, you're burning the PoW change bridge that would be so convenient to the longevity of the Core project. We would all benefit from keeping the conversation more open. Trying to preserve one's values by forsaking those same values is a broken path.
Keep believing. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:24:09
I understand. My own opinion is that having everyone work under the same banner is worrisome [in regard to decentralization]( I would rather have multiple sides debate publicly to the benefit of bystanders. 
At the same time I have never really took the time to listen to those guys, some thanks for the namedrop, I might go inform myself about them a little more on YouTube!
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:16:07
Does that mean you are a 2X supporter?
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:05:39
I understand you would agree that the moderators favor your favorite Bitcoin fork. Problem is, it's unethical.
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:15:10
Interesting, so hash power over time defines Bitcoin for you!
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:04:25
No, because 'properly' is subjective and only conveniently use to fit in the box for the comic.
Joking aside (sorry for being snarky XD). I'm not aware of any paper on the subject. If we conjecture, one would need to define measurable criteria, such as decentralization (gini coefficient?) and affordability. I'd suspect those two criterion are not independent. Affordability depends on the average channel settlement frequency, which is correlated with the network structure. 
There's certainly be interesting research in the form of simulations to be done on that later point. I suspect, intuitively, that the number of open channels is positively correlated with settlement frequency. That is because total capacity has to be split, while the variance of transaction size is not itself split if we use a gaussian mixture model. Smaller channels would have greater changes to go bust and need to be settled. In that scenario, a star-shaped network (highly centralized) would be more affordable by minimizing settlement.
Just my 2c. If you have any relevant papers as well, I'm interested, please let me know.

Why, is my personal opinion on Bitcoin causing harm? 
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:37:48


Indeed. With the price of bcash low as it is, it might be a proper hedge against the upcoming turmoil on the legacy chain. Especially if the EDA fix is pushed through soon, that would cause a price jump.

@_date: 2017-10-01 16:36:02


Your next sentences says the complete opposite.


You try to escape by going back to general statements. Of course one needs to abide to the rules, because you enforce them. The problem is that:
1. The rules are opaque (what defines Bitcoin for the mods?).
2. The rules are seemingly biased (why can't I promote my favorite fork?).
3. The rules are not decided in a democratic fashion (why do mods get to decide which forks are allowed to be spoken about?).
Those 3 things wouldn't be that much of a problem if this venue wasn't a major bitcoin forum.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:33:28


No, I made it clear I think it's a major facade. "This is still one of the biggest forum, if not the biggest. [...] newcomers still find this subreddit first. As the one of the main contender for Bitcoin public forums". It's undeniable that this subreddit plays an important role in the Bitcoin culture.


Obviously, you know that I know that, I quoted one of these rules in answer to your questions. However, they are still opaque because you do not clearly define what is and is not Bitcoin (relating rule  and you show this clearly here:


You did it again. I talk about Bitcoin forks, and you immediately assume altcoin. Why? Can't you see how that narrative is completely biased? What are you going to do if the legacy chain dies because S2X took all the hashpower and Core has to change PoW in its own hard fork, delete the subreddit because it doesn't cater to an existing coin anymore? The question is rhetorical. I'm trying to point out that your criterion are opaque, inadequate and seem to serve only your idea of what Bitcoin is.


Again, rhetorical question. The objective is to think about how it gives too much power to mods.


I'm certainly the kind of person who wants to see change when a pocket of people wield too much power. Mass media, banks, technological monopolies, you name it. Isn't that why we are all in Bitcoin, because we value decentralization?
