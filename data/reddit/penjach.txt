Hahah I must admit I did that when I sold my nexus 7 on a local website. I only had a phone with a bad camera, and it was night, so I pulled some pics from a German website and called it a day. Fortunately, my tablet looked about the same, and I met with the buyer for the sell, didn't send it by mail.

The problem is most people wouldn't think of doing something in your face which they wouldn't blink doing over the line. Main reason is that there is slim chance they will get caught.

@_date: 2014-01-15 01:44:56
No, but the chances of getting a block (which, FYI, is worth 25 bitcoins) are very small. Unless, of course, you have some mad Ghashes, in which case it still wouldn't be more profitable to mine solo.

Then you have a full client, meaning you have the info on all transactions ever. If you don't, you have to rely on others to check for double-spending.

Well yeah. First thing wasn't (supposedly) their fault, but the second surely is.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:08:39
You could always withdraw BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:32:47
That's a really easy fix to do. I wonder why didn't they oblige.
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:53:16
Omitting the first sentence, I agree, honestly. I expected more details from bitstamp. Even if they come back online, I won't be so sure about them as I was before. If 5MM theft did so much damage, what would they do if something worse happens?
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:07:36
Because I'm not sure. Maybe they cashed out. Now, after the relaunch, chances for that are really slim, but still exist.
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:42:13
I have been long enough to see that this is a fast-changing environment, and if a company has proved itself worthy of the respect time and time again, it is less likely it will run away with the money. Not to mention Pantera, which would tear those two Slovenians to shreds if they tried anything similar.

I transferred 0.1 btc to cryptsy last year, distributed it across several coins, and made 5 after some coin jumped like 200x. Then I returned 4 and continued playing with the rest. That's the aftermath.

Thanks, but you spelled "really fucking lucky" wrong. I hate gambling, and at the time I thought I was so smart, wondered why hadn't the Wall Street called me yet. Then I realized there is no way in hell I would repeat that success, so I bailed.

Ahahahh cheeky fuckers. I thought I was so smart for checking the source :P

I sent bitstamp a message through a form on their site. They didn't answer for a whole day, and now I'm getting worried.
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:43:11
No, and the address starts with a 3, so it's one of the new multi-sig addresses.
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:27:48
Titty that bounces around.
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:14:12
Exploits are inevitable. Bitstamp is responsible for not reflecting their losses caused by exploits onto customers, which it did not. Mostly, anyways, if you count in the loss of money because of the downtime.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:25:26
Yeah, I remember that. Constantly checking the price on the phone, strolling bitcointalk for answers, falling asleep next to pc with bitcoinwisdom app on, but in the meantime learning so much about crypto and economics I ain't even mad (also profited in the end so yeah).
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:46:44
That's why I said "supposedly"
@_date: 2015-01-11 15:35:32
Still hasn't arrived to me.  
EDIT: they did, now.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:03:11
He had an idea, and he realized it. It was fun, and somewhat informative. What more could you ask for?
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:20:37
I hadn't thought of that. Will try, thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:54:04
Some responsibility, but they didn't cause it (supposedly). Anyways, they *did* clear the orderbook, and are giving people enough time to put new ones.
@_date: 2015-01-08 12:05:52
Didn't you know? Bitcoins shed their seasonal addresses every spring, and grow new, untraceable ones. It's just their nature.
@_date: 2014-12-07 13:57:16
This is a great explanation. Could be a original post for itself.

Let me guess which one of those is more likely, by about 99% probability.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:58:18
True. Hell, if it dropped that much, all the traders would run to buy it at low price, immediately raising it.
@_date: 2013-05-18 07:09:30
Because most people don't understand what it is and search on Google.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:46:55
Yeah, I am still wondering how it wasn't stopped in its roots by banking lobbies.
@_date: 2013-07-01 15:48:37
Thanks for that info. Really big gap between bid/ask prices, though.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:39:57
But he doesn't have 250 btc. He said **when** btc hits 20k he will have enough money to go.

@_date: 2013-03-22 13:00:34
You are SO funny. I am just asking why I can't access my wallet, because if they are expanding their cloud bandwidth, it shouldn't cause downtime, unless they are changing their cloud provider.

@_date: 2013-12-21 23:25:15

@_date: 2013-06-04 10:45:27
You both have good points. I would just add that socialism as it was historically defined, and functional socialism that is practiced today in some countries, are two very different things.
@_date: 2013-09-06 17:33:10
That's it :D
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:28:51

@_date: 2013-04-14 13:35:25
This needs to change. I am in the bitcoin game for a year now, and sometimes I just can't comprehend some of the operations that should have been pretty straightforward. I think this is more of a problem than the wildly fluctuating value of bitcoin.

Not revolutionary, but Gox can't do that anymore, and coinbase is trying to reintroduce it step by step, to avoid the Gox's fate.

I guess those 3 guys still on there don't like bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:20:13
The way I see it, Bitcoin is *way* simpler than banking. Only that banks had enough time to take the complicated elements out of the consumers' eyes, showing only the absolutely necessary info. Bitcoin, with online wallets, is quickly approaching that level of simplicity and idiot-proof interface.

Depends on printer he used, but 5 is about the smallest most inkjet printers can print, and I'm talking about sans-serif fonts like arial and calibri, and he used 4. Also, I'm sure he intentionally misspelled one letter somewhere just for good measure.

That's the smart way to do it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:30:49
The thing is, with this amazingly rapid growth of Bitcoin, we expect even faster acceptance. This is a radical new idea, and it takes time to understand and accept how elegant it is. If you said to someone in late 80's how ubiquitous internet communication will be, few would believe you that with 20 bucks a month you could have the whole world in your hand anytime, anywhere. Today, it's equally hard to accept all of the advantages of Bitcoin payment.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:06:43
I would bet you use vanity addresses!
@_date: 2013-08-06 15:55:07
Oh I did not know that. And I suppose there is no limit as to what amount is added? In that case, coinbase really didn't do anything worth bragging about.

You really don't have any choice. Visa and MasterCard are the biggest, and if you don't accept them, the customer will most likely go somewhere else to buy, instead of going to the ATM.
