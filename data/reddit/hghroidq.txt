Excellent!  Is this something we can run a node for on a Raspberry Pi, by any chance?

I'm not sure if it's "pruning" I'm referring to.  I'll give likely a terrible description of what I thought I remembered reading a long time ago...
Each transaction is recorded to a block, &amp; each block is resolved approx every 10 minutes.  The last bit of information on one block links to the first bit of info on the new one.  After X number of blocks, the oldest blocks are reduced to just that little bit of information that linked them to other blocks.  After Y number more blocks, the bunch of "tags" from the reduced blocks become one "tag" at the end.
If this is the case, I wonder if it's not dictated by the number of blocks, but by the oldest stationary funds.  If Satoshi's bitcoins are never moved, maybe it never gets abbreviated?  If it has nothing to do with the oldest sitting funds, and there is a chain abbreviation, would that "tag" information be enough to establish ownership of those very old, unmoved, bitcoins?  Maybe there are some privacy advantages once the abbreviation begins?
If I'm even close to right with my description, and this is a thing..  I am wondering if X amount of blocks have come &amp; gone, and so there are now block "tags" in the chain, rather than entire blocks.  If so, have Y blocks happened, and many tags been reduced to one?  Also, if this type of strategy works, I wonder what would happen if the X, &amp; Y, were adjusted, to give a &gt;64gb, or &gt;128gb, max blockchain size.
If we currently have 7 years of every single transaction, and there has been no abbreviation, will X come in 7 more?  It's not the size of the blocks that matter, right, but the amount of them?  So it should be a set amount of time.  If this is ever to happen, we can say that it's more secure to have &gt;X full blocks in the chain, but then what is the right amount of blocks?  I'm not suggesting bringing it down to 6 months.  I am not really suggesting anything.  Just curious about how it works.  Maybe it's currently set to be 150 years, so as to include every possible transaction of every living person?  I imagine that's not feasible.
I just discovered last night that the blockchain has exceeded 64gb already.  It seems like it would be nice if we could cap that at 64gb, 128gb, or 256gb, just so that we aren't constantly having to upgrade the storage of our nodes.  I realize that's not in &amp; of itself the most dire of importance..  just wondering if we could, and why we would, or wouldn't, do it.

I noticed that.  Thanks.

As long as those with influence treat altering the protocol as something sacred nearly everyone should agree upon, the value is probably safe. As soon as 50.1-90% start ignoring the other 10-49.9%, the value will drop continually, because it's not just alienating those who weren't on board with the proposed changes, but the promise that bitcoin was will be shattered. The majority of those who haven't abandoned ship will continue to destroy bitcoin repeating the same mistakes; ignoring the minority despite their investment in the promise that was.. not realizing they'll eventually be in the minority disenfranchised from bitcoin, or the only ones left with a stake in it.
TL/DR: If there's basically a consensus about any characteristic of bitcoin, it won't matter what it is. If there isn't, it won't matter what it is.

Thanks!  So running this BitcoinQT with its 8 connections is contributing to UASF?

Thank you!
I am attempting to run a node on a Mac.  I downloaded bitcoin-0.14.1-bip148_segwit0.3-osx64.tar.gz and only recognized BitcoinQT, which I opened and is now synchronizing to the network.  I have 8 connections, and was under the impression that I'm not running a full validating node unless there are more than 8.
I may try to set up the RPi3 eventually, but I thought I could get the Mac running right away.
Thanks for creating this, and I will refer back.

ETH is a currency, but I don't think of it as a cryptocurrency.  More of an attack on cryptocurrencies.

I don't think I understand this. My understanding is that each user would have the option of paying a fee, but that it wasn't necessary. If I want to send some bitcoins, am I paying a fee despite not electing to? If so, how is that possible? If not, wouldn't individuals just set whatever fee they're willing to offer to expedite their transactions?
