hasn't that stat been proven to be highly exaggerated? I agree that we should worry about centralization, but we have a capacity issue looming on the horizon and all of the ideas to fix it are further off than the wall we will run into when we hit capacity. If you are all opposed to 20MB, why not offer something smaller? even if it's a lot smaller... we still need to kick this problem down the road a bit even if just by a year or two more to give everyone a chance to further develop the other scaling options. Allowing the network to get needlessly bogged down will just drive people away.

@_date: 2015-06-15 15:22:40
Bitcoin can scale like that as long as the tech is scaling with it. Even if this is just kicking the can down the road a few years, it is worth it. We are dangerously close to capacity already, and we don't need to actually hit 1MB consistently to start to see long confirmation times. We've had a 1MB cap for what? nearly 6 years? if the network could handle it back then, low-end capacity should be closer to 3 MB by now just given improvements in bandwidth and computer performance. The antis' argument is based on nothing more than flawed logic and conflicts of interest. If the protocol runs into a wall of 6 block waits for a single confirmation, bitcoin will die overnight. It immediately becomes useless to anyone beside speculators and people like peter todd who want it to be just for settlement.

It is one solution. Another solution would be to simply scale bitcoin the way it was supposed to be scaled: increase the block size. The lightning network isn't bitcoin.

most everyone is able to run a full node, they just don't out of convenience unfortunately. nodes should be incentivized.


that's what we'll also see if it doesn't scale. there is little use for the system if this is where we max out. 


the one thing I don't get about this argument is what makes you think it's the block size causing the centralization. it's hard to believe there are many people who use bitcoin yet can't handle the minimal bandwidth for a full node. 
Mining centralization is the larger problem, but, again, reducing block size isn't going to help because we will still just have a few mining cartels and large pools. Unless I am seriously wrong about something here.
conversely, I was somewhat calmed by the fact that during ever single stress test, all of my transactions were confirmed in the very next block.

let's not forget that this is with a 11Mb/1Mb connection. That is a download speed of less that one third the US average and an upload speed of less than a tenth of average.

increasing the block size limit is not the same as increasing the 21m limit. The 1MB limit was always meant to be temporary. It was 32MB at the start before satoshi reduced it to 1MB, with plans to expand it later when needed. It will soon be needed, and therefore we need to increase it. 
If we stay at 1MB and then the network gets bogged down, bitcoin will lose all of its credibility. Credibility that has taken years to get.

it is not really fair to compare bitcoin to stock in a company. However, nothing you said in any way changes how the instrument is valued. It is still entirely speculative. The whole concept of stock is to allow speculative investment in companies. The 'value' of a company doesn't really change day-to-day, yet the stock price does. Why? because of speculation. No one said companies don't have products that MAY OR MAY NOT have value. The point is you are speculating what that value may be. It's all gambling and you are fooling yourself if you really think one is safer than the other merely because you think it has some basic value. You can still lose all your money. It doesn't really matter if the company still has buildings that are worth something or employees. Companies can squander all of their capital, and they often do. You must speculate that they won't and that the price someone will pay for your share will be higher later on.

oh god!!! you're a Jesus freak!!!  the point is that they have no authority to ban people's right to ingest whatever they want. your body is yours to do what you want as long as you don't harm other people. If I want to sit at home and take a dose of MDMA, that affects no one other than me. The government has no authority to throw me in a cage for doing this. The government stepped outside of it's bounds when doing this. "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."
Furthermore, you think mandating schools is a violations of parents' rights to decide on the upbringing of their children, but you don't think drug laws are a violation of what I decide to do to myself???? Think before you speak!!! 
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:11:40
Exactly! Regardless of what Purse THINKS is happening, they cannot know since all transactions are actually handled by Amazon. Most orders are shipped though UPS and Fedex, both of which allow package interception. If an order were actually cancelled due to fraud the item would never be delivered. Here the OP's items were delivered and Purse is stealing his money. If the items are delivered OP should get paid!!!

dollar cost averaging is the definition of a stupid idea. if you think an investment is good then buy, but don't buy to reduce losses in your head. if you buy a stock at $100 and it goes to $50, your losses don't go down when you buy more.

Mark Karpeles will have some bad sushi and the resulting violent diarrhea will force out all the bitcoins that he ate while running gox, propelling him and any remaining btc in his bowel upwards to the moon. Obviously this has serious upward influence on the price of btc when the market realizes that the coins really were just temporarily unavailable.
@_date: 2014-06-28 21:39:35
someone correct me if I am wrong: I thought new btc will be created till sometime in the next century and by that time transaction fees will pay the miners. aggregate tx fees to miners are low now because there are so few transactions. something that is expected to change by the time we hit 21m coins.
@_date: 2014-03-14 18:50:54
it will reach 10,000 by june, then it won't matter. we will no longer compare it to the dollar. we build a rocket to the moon and leave the non-believers behind. we shall build a new society in the shadow of the earth based on the concepts embodied in bitcoin: freedom to not pay credit card transaction fees; no banking fees; and easy access to drugs online;

maybe technically true, but legal gold currency is never used anymore given that it's real value is always much higher than face value. any investment is taxable, whether in currency or property. did anyone expect the irs to come out and say btc is tax-free??? if you made money on forex, you also have to pay tax in the income... it really is overblow... even more so when you consider that no one is really going to bother paying these taxes anyway as there is no way to reasonably prove when you bought or sold the bitcoin unless a person uses only one wallet. I personally keep my stash in one investment wallet and tumble to new wallets before I spend... my investment wallet obviously is not attached in any way to my name. I never plan to pay tax on any of it and nothing is going to come of it.
@_date: 2014-09-20 16:12:13
Because we all know that the value of stocks and bonds isn't driven by speculation, and that investment in any sense of the word doesn't merely refer to financial speculation.

always confuses me when I see questions like this. the total supply of bitcoin has not changed in any way. it didn't 9 months ago and it didn't today. these coins aren't gonna be put on an exchange at a market sell order. if the feds had simply burned the coins, that would be a different story. the only way this really moves the market will be if they were sold at a price greatly different from the current market value. and even then it depends on sentiment.

they will probably use coinbases method of discouraging carders by simply canceling so many orders that most think it isn't even worth the effort. If they don't do this or call confirmation on every order of even small size, they will go down faster than the titanic.

any strategy is better then buying at a peak, but that is something that is pretty easy to avoid... besides the only people who buy on peaks are panic buyers trying to chase an upswing... not the kind of people with the self control required to execute DCA as they are looking for the quick buck and DCA doesn't really work for that as it equally mitigates upside potential on the per share average that DCAer like to use.

that's the point. if there is only one miner, which is the end-game when anyone stays above 51% for very long, we end up with a system where a government CAN dictate what happens and CAN block payments/reverse payments! bitcoin becomes something akin to Amazon coins... people just need to admit this is a problem and fix it. you all think that no altcoin can overtake bitcoin... that is what people have said about every big player in history and they have always been wrong. bitcoin CAN be displaced if someone gets it better. this problem can and will kill bitcoin if it doesn't get fixed. and somehow it plays out here like congress and the debt ceiling... run up to the last minute and people move away from GHASH...

"I did," said Ford.  "It is."
"So," said Arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, "why don't the people get rid of the lizards?"
"It honestly doesn't occur to them," said Ford.  "They've all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they voted in more or less approximates to the government they want."
"You mean they actually vote for the lizards?"
"Oh yes," said Ford with a shrug, "of course."
"But," said Arthur, going in for the big one again, "why?"
"Because if they didn't vote for a lizard," said Ford, "the wrong lizard might get in."

ok, first of all, the can't tie YOU to any wallet before the purchase!! They can trace them back all the way to the miner but they cannot prove ownership of any wallet. furthermore, there is no need to provide real info when ordering using bitcoin. it's not a credit card. and, even if that doesn't dissuade you: lets say they treat it as a currency. sorry but the taxation situation is little changed. let's say you buy 100 euros at 50 cents a peice, then they go up to a dollar a piece. you still owe tax when you convert them back to dollars to make a purchase here. jesus people what did you expect the IRS to say? bitcoins is not taxable??? everything gets taxed... just don't pay it.

Actually, since there is no regulation, it doesn't matter what anybody here wants to think.

@_date: 2014-03-04 18:15:45
seems to me that the biggest problem isn't so much the need for regulating the actual transactions as the people managing these sites... I fear the regulations will tend toward forcing charge-backs on some sites... a requirement that would destroy bitcoin... or requiring id verification simply to spend or move bitcoin anywhere... I see bitcoin as an digital analog to cash... and I would have no problems with regulation on, say, bitcoin banks, like for fiat... but I fear it may be a slippery slope... allowing charge-back fraud into the system will make it no more valuable than credit cards and therefore useless... if a person's login credentials are compromised, through no fault of the exchange, do you feel the exchange should have to cover the loss? I fear this will be one of the major points of any new regulation... and it would be crushing for bitcoin's development...

I remember the whole Linux thing from the 90s, but when it came down to it there really wasn't much of an advantage to most people. The average person bought a computer with windows already installed and could barely operate that system. Linux was never easy for most people. Linux filled a hole that no one really needed filled. More security and ease of use was already provided by Mac OS, albeit at a premium price.

no one is saying it is a GOOD THING that people say that. Simply at this point in bitcoin's development it is actually surprising to see interest numbers even this high. Most people have no idea what it is and have seen no great reason to get into it. These numbers are in no way surprising nor are they particularly good OR bad. It is rather that it is good that even such a reasonable number DON'T reject it at this point.

the problem is you are looking at them as one investment, when, in fact they are two distinct investments. If you buy 1 bitcoin at a thousand and it goes to 500, you lost 500 on paper, regarless of whether or not you buy more at 500. Really, you might as well pick a different investment every time if you are so risk averse. It will have the same effect and actually spread your risk out over different asset classes. for 'proof' here is a good paper:

laws are rarely changed for the better by "working within the democratic system." it is that system that created these unjust laws. you submit that every law should be obeyed without question. this is simply an absurd stance. there are state where oral sex is against the law. should people simply obey that on principle? furthermore the very government that creates these laws violates them itself. branches of the government launder money all the time and make deals with drug cartels. these laws are the very definition of unjust.

The biggest feature is for people who live in countries where credit card fraud is higher. If you live in, say, Ukraine and want to order something from the states (or even from within Ukraine), it is a huge deal when it is even possible just because the merchants can't trust that the transaction isn't with stolen cards. Bitcoin mitigates this problem, opening up international commerce in a big way.

I really hate it when people say this... I don't give a shit if you sell or not, you are losing money when your property declines in value. Holding something till the end of time hoping for it to return to it's former glory does not mean that you haven't lost anything because you haven't sold at a loss. I know someone who bought Lucent at $40 a share... he still has it. I am sure he'll be glad to hear he hasn't lost any money.

I travel overseas 6-8 times a year, and I am constantly dealing with these same problems. The biggest of which is the fraud issue. No money has ever been taken from my accounts, but the proactive fraud measures taken by the bank cause me headaches all the time. A few years ago I was overseas and my bank froze my debit card 3 times in a week for 'suspicious' activity despite my telling them before I left where I was going to be. It caused untold nightmares. Already bitcoin is making my life that much easier. An atm ate my debit card and I was left with just a little cash, but a lot of bitcoin. I was able to pay for my hotels, return ticket and sell a little bit on localbitcoin. Saved my ass having a bunch of money right on my computer. If only btc atms take off this will be the go-to medium for frequent travelers.

jesus!!! if you had done even a minimal amount of research and gave a shit at all about bitcoin, you would not have been using them. what that company is is widely known and if anyone were to come here to ask first, no one would beat them down... they would be told not to use them... you decided to throw your money at them even though you probably already knew about the 51% issue...

the problem here is really the government infringement on property rights. if you take the stance, as I do, that the government's primary, and to some extent, only function should be to protect people from each other, for something to be considered a crime, there must be a victim. the mere transfer of property harms no one. It, therefore, should not be regulated or criminal in any way. The op's point was that you can't just outright ban new tech. because it helps criminals. all new tech helps criminals. you might as well ban the use of credit cards as well, because there very existence created an entirely new criminal enterprise. an enterprise that bitcoin could virtually stop in it's tracks were it to take off. he was saying everything new has good and bad uses, and he is right.

why does everyone think everything has to be big and widely adopted to be useful...

He won't!!! how many sites have gone down and taken peoples money??? and people still don't keep their own wallets??? Please!!!

@_date: 2014-04-26 13:46:51
I am gonna say the one thing I never wanted to hear. If we really want widespread adoption, someone needs to come up with a secure wallet that uses biometrics to sign transactions. Or some other method to prevent other people from taking control of the coin. Most people are idiots when it comes to security and even a lot of the early adopters are, as we can see already from all of these thefts. It is just too easy to spread malware and steal coin for BTC to really take off. The last time I saw stats on infections it was close to 50% of computers. My guess would be even higher. People don't really worry about their CC getting stolen because they are covered. With BTC they are not. Once an average person decides to try BTC out, he will, more likely than not, get his coin stolen.

the thing is, if you bought it at a $1000, nothing you do will ever change the fact that you bought it at that price. It has been established over and over that this is not an effective strategy. The only time it is reasonable is if the person who does it cannot afford to invest a lump sum and invests as money becomes available but that is not considered DCA.

I don't think you quite understand how this works and the immensely slippery slope such thinking leads to. Bitcoins are not art and that argument is specious. Bitcoins are meant to function as a currency. The fact that the ledger is public does NOT mean you can ever know who really owns the coin. You say it is a known address now. If the current owner makes one transfer, we no longer know WHO owns the coin. This does not mean it is a system run for criminals. It means it is a system governed by logic. If I mark a fifty dollar bill and then it gets stolen, and then, 3 weeks later, I see it again in someones wallet or in a cash register, that does not mean I have found the thief and I can now take my money back. That's not how it works. Money is fungible. Property is not.

I am not sad at all to see it go down. I am up no matter what and I am in for the long term. I don't care about this day-to-day movement. spikes and corrections are a normal part of any market. I see this as a buying opportunity but I understand there is always risk that we are wrong. I just question the idea of dollar cost averaging in general. I have seen it used so many times by amateurs as a way to stomach bad buying decisions and they are likely to keep making them. if you just have extra money to invest and you believe in btc and want to throw in whenever you can but have bad luck finding the bottom, I guess it's ok now as we are early adopters, but this quickly becomes foolish as the market ages... remember we are not investing in a company that has long term growth potential. this is a currency (disregarding what the irs thinks) that at some point will stabilize and there really won't be any money to be made.

They were selectively scamming bitcoin buyers. They waited for items to ship and then froze accounts for "suspicious activity" despite the fact that they have no way of determining this since amazon handles all transactions. They did this without notice and without communication, and they refuse to respond to emails. Yet they told the bitcoin sellers nothing and just waited for them to get the items and they kept the bitcoin for themselves. Even if the activity were suspicious, they should inform people and amazon. It was really starting to become obvious that the site runners were just using this to profit off of both scammers and legitimate users.

the more I think about this the more shortsighted these people seem. Amazon is the worlds largest e-commerce site (I didn't look this up, but it is likely true). they operate on a global scale and are ever seeking to expand. I also know there are many people in many places who would like to order from amazon but cannot due to problems with credit/debit cards in their locals and the risks for amazon in accepting such orders due to fraud. bitcoin solves these problems and also allows simple pricing structures for all items and the possibility of a single global e-commerce site. Also, despite what anyone says, bitcoin does not have too much of a learning curve for people overseas to want to use if they could order from amazon. They already go to extreme and complicated measures to order from there.

"professional stock, index, bond etc traders" don't really exist, unless you consider gambling a profession. most of these people are lucky if they can outperform the indexes. Please tell me how most of these people who 'know their shit' constantly get wiped out in the same bubbles as everyone else. They have no special insights into anything. The statement that "everyone knows bitcoin is a joke" really proves my point. Anyone who says that is either very poorly informed or an idiot. If we are talking about traders, I'm gonna go with idiots. Traders just try to talk with authority about things they no little to nothing about.

that's the rub! people knocking Charlie are just assuming that this criminal complaint is accurate. As if the DOJ is always right and never trumps up charges or gets information about people illegally. After Snowden, you would think people would know better. Furthermore, the idea that he was laundering money by selling bitcoin seems a bit of a stretch. I suppose we will have to wait and see as there is still no real precedent here.

This was kind of my point... as long as the person doesn't try to simply 'cash out' there is no reason to trace these coins, because there would be no way to prove a chain of ownership unless you can prove that own person owned every address in the chain.

but what's the solution? unfortunately isn't this is a problem we will always have? even if we forked and forcibly disallowed pools (don't know that this is actually possible, but probably not) there would be nothing stopping one person or organization from simply building super powerful mining farms. I have a feeling the point is moot now. The protocol has gotten away from modification that doesn't benefit the big pools. The only alternative is switching to an altcoin. And despite what everyone here says, I think there is a value in trying to develop altcoins in the long term.

@_date: 2014-03-26 13:19:37
ok... so lets say I have a bit of btc and then I sell the whole amount to someone I meet on localbitcoin, then he goes the next day and transfers them to an exchange and sells them. How exactly does the IRS plan to know what the hell is going on here, let alone prove it? the protocol doesn't differentiate transfers from one person to another from one person to himself. This is bullshit and it won't matter. Sure people who are dealing with hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars worth will have to pay, but I am sure they already are dealing with this. But those of us with small holdings have nothing to worry about. The IRS can never know when you actually bought your coins!!! They can only know when they were transferred to a wallet. unless of course you buy from coinbase, leave them there and then spend from there, always using your real info.

An expert who doesn't know that the reverse proxy is built into most RATs and bots these days... many of which sell for less than $50 or free... any of these programs on your computer would explain what happened. Your antivirus would likely not ever even notice.

not every hooker. but prostitution by choice is indeed victimless. and I would say if it's not by choice, then it isn't really prostitution, but human trafficking  and rape. and I am sure there are plenty of prostitutes that don't need your high and mighty "protection". they are doing just fine. if you are talking about women forced into this as slaves, then I would agree they are victims.

If you are buying investment instruments, there is no guarantee what someone else will later pay for them regardless of the value of assets. What that value is is always speculative. All investments are speculative by their very nature. If they were not speculative, there would never be any risk and everyone would be rich and no one would ever lose money. This is all pretty straightforward.

something tells me that you don't know what the term "priced-in" means. future price increases aren't 'priced-in'... that doesn't even make any sense. possible news and assumptions about news can be "priced-in".

You really are thick. The whole point is that it depends on the user. You can hurt yourself with almost anything depending on the way it is used. Drugs aren't special in that regard. They can be used responsibly or not. But the drugs by themselves aren't bad, just the ways they can be used, and that should be up to the user, not the government. Heroin is still used in medicine for example, and not to harm people. Perhaps you should go educate yourself.

“How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?” The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that “an unjust law is no law at all.” - MLK

Now they say it is a fraud issue. I am sorry but the fraud argument just doesn't make any sense unless it is completely random.

furthermore, the problem with the justice system these days, is that instead of simply punishing and preventing crime, it seeks to create a regulatory atmosphere where the crime cannot take place. however, there are two problems with this approach.

This has more to do with the fact that we all tend to understand prices in whatever currency we deal with most often. In Belarus, they aren't converting down in their heads. They simply deal with the large numbers. Also, I am confused by your logic: how does it prove to you that we deal with large numbers better? you were converting the numbers so they were smaller, not larger. 1,000,000 of a currency seemed like monopoly money so you converted to $105; a smaller number. Just as if we went to bits, all the prices in bitcoin would immediately be HUGE. I have no problem thinking in bitcoins already... a change would make it more difficult.

how is that? just because I believe a crime is only a crime if it harms someone? drug use is not a real crime. money laundering is not a real crime. sometimes stealing is not a real crime if the person or company has it coming.  if we are talking about physical violence, then I would lean towards a moral obligation, but it still depends on the circumstances.

First of all, there are lots of drugs that are either impossible or almost impossible to OD on. Secondly, the drug addicts hurt themselves with the drugs.

This is very simply, yet a common problem with a lot of people today. You have to stop thinking about the current quarter and think in the longer term. If you believe in the fundamentals, just hold your position and don't let movement jolt you. We all got into this knowing how volatile BTC is. If you really think BTC is gonna die, then get out now. But if you really think this is gonna last, don't focus on the value in $ all the time. It's hard to make it through bear markets when you pay attention.It's surprisingly easy when you don't. As long as you invest only what you can, there could be a very, very big payoff some time down the road if we are all right on this one.

I forget, when was the last time a executive from a drug company was sent to jail for an overdose of prescription drugs??? Users are culpable for their own actions.  Anyone who says otherwise is trying to avoid personal responsibility. If someone ODs, it's not the fault of the dealer. The user should take responsibility for abusing the product.

Also, Direct from the wiki:
"&gt;50% attack
If the attacker controls more than half of the network hashrate, the previous attack has a probability of 100% to succeed. Since the attacker can generate blocks faster than the rest of the network, he can simply persevere with his private fork until it becomes longer than the branch built by the honest network, from whatever disadvantage.
No amount of confirmations can prevent this attack; however, waiting for confirmations does increase the aggregate resource cost of performing the attack, which could make it unprofitable or delay it long enough for the circumstances to change or slower-acting synchronization methods to kick in."

Not only is that a stretch, but it's not even the point. Larger blocksize allows the potential for growth. Limiting it like this is counter to the very idea of bitcoin. Keeping the blocks small just so people on out of date systems without broadband can run full nodes, removes the point of their running full nodes anyway if the userbase can't grow. The vast majority of users are already using SPV wallets, and somehow I doubt there are very many people running full nodes on such shitty DSL anyway.
@_date: 2015-07-31 01:51:54
where the hell do you morons even get your statistics? every measurement there is puts average upload speeds high enough to support 8MB blocks at least. you dipshits just need to upgrade your 56k modems. Less than 3Mbps upload isn't even considered broadband in the states anymore by the FCC.

if the blocksize isn't resolved anytime soon, and it doesn't seem likely that it will be, it's only a matter of time before this issue gets out to a wider audience, and they don't need to understand it. They will just see it as a problem with a new currency that is better avoided. There are already people popping up not understanding why their transactions aren't getting through. Not everyone sits on all day. These days people expect things to just work. Right now bitcoin just doesn't, and, unless someone can push fools like Peter Todd and Luke-Jr off to the side, it likely never will.
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:57:42
The problem isn't the amount of the proposed increases. The opposition's moronic stance is that current tech doesn't even support the 1MB limit. They insist that *everyone* should be able to run a full node regardless of their system or lack of broadband internet. All of the figures they like to throw around are based on calculations running on **lower-than-broadband** speed and they still claim that is what most people have.

really only miners can do this... spamming the network doesn't increase the size miners create. they can use soft limits just like they do now.


spammers are still limited by the cost of such an attack. The larger the blocksize limit, the larger the cost of such an attack


This is the problem. we can't reach an agreement on what basic requirements for running the core client should be. Some people, like peter todd and luke-jr, insist that modern hardware and internet connections can't handle 1MB blocks. This argument is clearly a load of dingos' kidneys, but it remains the biggest hurdle.

You do not even have broadband internet. Something tells me this is more than a "little" rural. *Most* people are on much better connections and not just in the US. The states are laggards in the area. You are the one here spreading FUD. Every metric out there show much better broadband penetration than you are always claiming here. You always claim it's the large blockers who are out there basing everything on their fast internet connections when it is you just saying everyone has shitty internet just because you do. I have been in over a dozen countries in the last year across Europe and Asia and in both cities and rural areas. Of all the places I have been, only maybe once or twice have I had upload too slow to support 1MB blocks. Most places I would have been able to easily support much larger blocks.

@_date: 2015-09-04 14:57:39
I don't know where you were staying, but fast internet was most definitely available almost everywhere I was. The only time I need to suffer slow speeds is usually in the states, but it's still not nearly as bad there as LukeJr likes to claim. The speeds he's claiming he has are *by definition* NOT broadband. I think everyone should be able to agree that the line needs to be drawn somewhere for minimum requirements to run a full node, and as with most things these days you need broadband internet.

no, one seed per device. However you can create separate groups of addresses on one device all of which are from a single seed. BTW, Ledger uses a 24 word seed.
you can use the seed with other wallets.

I hope so! I got stopped out at 480... I'll double my coins if it gets back down there.

I love it! I put in a trailing stop loss on the way up... now when it gets back down I will be close to doubling my holdings.

and this is important how? most people already have *actual* broadband internet. the fact that you choose to live in some backwater bible belt should have no bearing on when blocksize is increased. I'm running bitcoin core right now over a tethered mobile connection running at 45/45Mbps with no issues. 
just more FUD from luke-jr about internet speeds.
