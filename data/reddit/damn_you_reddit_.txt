Yes but I think those people would typically be at the bottom of the chain, so ultimately it might be served up for free, but everyone has already made their money at that point. Some people might try to wait until it's free, whereas some people would probably be willing to pay a little to get a faster and more immediate download.

Well in that scenario the content creators would also be responsible for delivering the content. If they sold to a few people who had plenty of bandwidth to provide then the content could be delivered more quickly. Maybe there wouldn't be too many layers to the chain though...maybe it would only tend to be three deep. The original creator, some people who own a bunch of server equipment, and then the people paying a few bucks to download.

I've always thought an auction type business model would work for online media. A content creator puts his work up for sale at a certain price to one or many people willing to buy it. Once those individuals purchase it at that price they turn around and resell it at a lower price to more people. As the reselling continues the price drops very quickly, and everyone up the chain buying/reselling makes a small profit. The last people to buy the video would end up paying a very low price. You might also have to implement some kind of proof-of-bandwidth protocol since some people might be willing to pay for a faster download.

I bet it was that hacker 4chan that did it. Dude is out of control.

Yeah that's not a bad idea, but in that case he still has to set up a website. He could sell it to someone who has tons of servers and bandwidth who could then turn around and release the vid once a certain number have bought in.
