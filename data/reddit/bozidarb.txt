Exactly. I tried that couple of times and failed almost every time lol. But, we have to know that finding bottom in bull market is much more difficult than finding bottom at bear market. In a bull madket you have one day to buy and then it shoots up, in a bear its a longer period of buying oportunities.

"Blockchain enthusiast" actually means "Looking at shitcoins prices every day".

It depends on the size of the coins  (quite literally).

Who says they haven't done that already? Through OTC deals I am sure.

I don't agree. December buyers will not sell on break even point. Greed is all over the place. If they suffered for a year and didn't sell anything, surely they won't sell when they are on a break even point. Fomo will get in their heads again and they will wait to see what happens. They might sell some portion of their stack but surely not everything.

If you want the best advice regarding a perticular coin, read other's coins subbredit and forums. Example: wanna know about ethereum, read bitcoin's subreddit and learn about ethereum.  Answers in the subbredit of a coin you wanna know about are mostly to "good", every one saying "it's going to the moon"...
