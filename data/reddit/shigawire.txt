Krugman won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2008.

a 1 person dev team has enough resources to implement a proper test environment.  Not being able to test, monitor for problems, and roll them back if stuff goes wrong is just amateur hour.

I like the bit where they take biometrics, a photo and save a copy of my id.

Yeah, but is that really your day-to-day way of working?
@_date: 2014-01-15 19:09:32


*shrug* and the Nobel Peace Prize was created by a gun-runner. :)
I don't agree with Krugman on many of his opinions on Bitcoin (but I at least appreciate him describing the basis of that opinion).  At the same time, the Overstock.com CEO's attack just smacks of opportunistic marketing.

I sent  m฿100 to bitcoin24 something like 30 minutes before it went down. It was a lesson worth every cent :-)
The last couple of weeks looking at BTC-e were... interesting. I think my money is safer with bitcoin24.

Am I reading this right in that you just tipped someone 5 BTC when the current rate is &gt; 90USD?
That seems madly generous of you.

It went down some hours ago because it was executing trades multiple times, and either crediting double or not at all. There isn't a btc24 to avoid anymore.

There was a slight moment of panic even knowing this when putting in an order for 50 BTC while the price was dropping

Security through obscurity works about as well for network engineering as it does for cryptography.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:59:38
Given there are several reputable secure hosting providers that can spin up high-end bare-metal servers in under 2 hours, why are you waiting the 2 weeks?

But most network providers, including CloudFlare, do say exactly how they identify and block DDoS traffic, just as ISPs and other email providers share information and techniques on identifying and blocking spam. Shared block lists of email spammers are openly available in real-time, and the better anti-spam systems are based on well reviewed open standards.
DDoS mitigation is security; Ask any network professional.
I wouldn't trust a closed DDoS mitigation system any more than I'd trust a closed cryptosystem.

If the bots are able to easily change the market value due to the volume they are putting through, the bots *are* the market.
You can trade somewhere else, although people profiting from arbitrage will likely drive other exchange prices as well.
If the problem is lag in trading, well, given MtGox seem only able to handle a few trades a second, the problem is really with them running a shoddy platform. This isn't the '90s.

Not sure if you're being serious or not.
Asking questions is good. I'm stunned someone would write something like this in PHP; You have to fight the language to write secure code in it even if you know what you're doing. But 5 transactions a second?
If the trading engine can't handle 1000s transactions a second without guaranteeing consistency, they are likely doing it wrong, but performance aside:
If the engine can't be guaranteed to stay consistent in the degenerate case, there is no way it should be used. By "guaranteed" I don't mean "It worked for a while", I mean provably correct.
I'm not saying that this applies to everyone, but there is a high correlation between people who prefer to write in PHP and those who don't have the background knowledge to write code of that type. Even given someone writing PHP code that seems correct there is another problem: PHP core developers have shown in the past a total inability to understand consistency issues such as these. Given that you just can't trust the platform you're writing on. [This example alone is enough for me to never, ever use the language](
Friend's don't let friends do PHP. Especially not for situations like these. Before I get overrun with flames for throwing out wild accusations about their favourite language, I would suggest reading this first:
which goes into a lot more detail.

It's an outside chance that it is, but there is a chance... Given that there is pretty much zero chance that there is only one copy of the webapp running at any time, there would have to be a queue between the webapp and the backend engine enforcing the consistency, with only a single copy of the backend engine running.
I'll accept that there is a chance of that happening. :) Unfortunately given what happened to BTC24, it doesn't look like it :-/
