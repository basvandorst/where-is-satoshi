We have been tracking a trend that many of you have been suspecting for a while, revolving around an inverse correlation between what the majority of social media thinks, and what actually occurs in the weeks following. There are many instances where the peak of mentions of these negative-sentiment keywords occur within a few hours or days of when a price bottom hits.
You can [explore the site for yourself]( and adjust the timeframe as needed to see further history. Santiment subscribers get full historical data of all coins. Give Santiment a [follow on Twitter]( if you like these types of insights. Thanks!

I just published my study on crowd behavior, and how we can use social metrics and mentions of positive/negative keywords to gauge when tops and bottoms are forming. Traders can really take advantage of using [Social Trends]( to see when FOMO and FUD is taking over in the markets, and they can react accordingly.
