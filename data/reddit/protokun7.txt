That's a good outlook to have. The important thing is to have enough money to support yourself; anything extra is a bonus. I've spared what I could so far and I'll just watch and see what that does.

That's still three times as much as me. At some point I'll think about getting some more. I'm not in the US so I don't quite have as many options to buy them.

Hey, I'd heard of Bitcoin before the price jumped up a few months ago, but I didn't look deeply enough into it. I wish I'd tried it out when each coin was going for about £10. I'm fairly new to it now and I only have 0.107 but at least it's something.

You say a number of them; it's enabled reddit-wide now, isn't it? I think it is, unless there's a way for certain subreddits to turn it off or something.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:39:36
The post was actually deleted really quickly; I didn't even read it.
Yeah, it would understandably be exciting to see the value increase, though as long as ultimately you don't lose the money you originally invested, that's what matters. As long as you remember the rule of not investing what you couldn't afford to lose, you won't run into major trouble, but it does look like it will be on the up from here.

Neither have I. What's the biggest tip he's given?
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:32:37
I wish I'd bought some back then. I can't remember if it was 2011 when I heard of it or after that.
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:27:40
No, I know it is radii. I was saying that because people see radii, they must jump to the conclusion that it's always -ii without realising that the first I is from the root (as radius still has the I in it). It could only be Nexii if the singular is "nexius".
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:19:32
That doesn't sound bad at all from the kid's perspective.

Hypertext transfer protocol protocol?
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:39:12
One tenth of a Bitcoin; I've got 0.1 BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:05:22
Heh, maybe if I'd waited a few more days to try Bitcoin out I'd've had a chance of making the millionth wallet (as if). Blockchain is my choice of client.
I'd love to see the reaction of whomever it was, though. They'd surely be ecstatic.
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:10:28
I just wish I'd been able to buy sooner. I've got a bit now though, so we'll see what happens.
@_date: 2014-01-15 08:05:15
Wow...damn, that's nice.
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:14:56
Welcome; I bought my first coins not too long ago either (0.1).
@_date: 2014-01-01 10:18:36
^(Lose is the opposite of gain, Loose is the opposite of tight.)
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:47:47
That's humbling; seeing my total BTC balance expressed as a tip.
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:17:37
I don't remember when I'd first heard of it but it was when each coin was relatively cheap; in hindsight I really should have investigated it more. What I could set aside when I finally did would've bought me about 5 BTC back in the day.
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:02:02
Buy it, or read the FAQ for a start. That's what it's there for.
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:17:47
I've never seen it before either; the account's only been here for three days, so it's fairly new.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:10:39
And adding to this, if Nexus were second declension, it would be Nexi with one I, not two. People see words like "radii" and for some reason neglect to realise that one of those Is is already there in the root word, not added on. -us becomes -i, never -ii.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:45:17
I doubt I would've had enough to buy that many even at the price they were at the time, but even a few would've made a massive difference, certainly.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:07:16
550 BTC?!
Wow, if I even had half of a full one I'd've withdrawn it and not trusted anyone else to keep it. I can't imagine how awful that feels. I'm pretty new to this, but keeping any sizeable amount in an exchange sounds like an awful idea. And apparently it was.
@_date: 2014-01-02 23:39:37
Stuff like this makes me wish I'd bought some years ago.
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:37:01
Bear tipping; think extreme cow tipping.

Saying "Thanks for watching"?
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:16:22
Woah nelly, that's a lot.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:55:48
I don't mine as I have no hardware worth doing a thing with, but a flood of submissions about leaving the pool has provided quite a bit of excitement for some reason.
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:13:40


Begone with you.
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:14:33
That's a new one; I was unfamiliar with that term before.
@_date: 2014-06-26 22:33:52
You know you make quotes with &gt;, right? Not typing an actual bar.
    &gt; just do this

Centibitcoin; I've got 0.1 BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-27 16:46:33
Yeah, me too...a deposit address is understandable but not the email address.
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:17:15
TFW I had no means to mine back then.
@_date: 2016-06-12 08:49:51
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:14:45
Would be nice. I remember when we used to have tipping (not that I got many, but I remember it).

Right Alt.
The Gr stands for Graphics.

I've been here for going on six years. My advice is send me everything. It's OK, you can trust me.
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:28:20
Nice that the little bit I have is now worth more but I really should buy just a bit more.
I keep telling myself that.
@_date: 2015-10-10 11:26:05




That's wealthy as far as I'm concerned. I have about 0.1 BTC *at best*.
Yeah, I came in late.
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:12:01
Seems like a nice enough idea.
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:05:10
Maybe he meant 999,999 miners but rounded it up to a million.
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:12:21
I'm one of them; I'm finally getting into it and I've been reading up; I think I've got the basics of it now. I can't remember when I first heard of Bitcoin but I'm all too aware that I should've investigated it sooner. Oh well. I don't have a lot but it seems worth looking at.
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:02:06
Well damn, now I wish I could draw.
