if that's not bullish i don't know what

awesome idea

great work man, thanks for sharing! really appreciate it.

well if i try to buy 100 EUR giftcards i always have to pay up to 120 EUR in BTC. I already looked it up a few times, last time before my post. Maybe its better with USD.

yeah but that is way to shitty. The last time i used BTC ATMs the fees were about 1% - 4%, but no where near 30%.

ohh i see, could you tell me a good one for euro?

my comment was in no way meant to promote that extension, wouldn't use that too
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:17:38
and pay up to 20% fees (bad exchange rate)? i'd rather not waste that much money

It's the Facebook AI blocking you because of the crypto ad ban, they track words like "bitcoin, blockchain, etc.". You can try and leave out these words in the description and then there shouldn't be a problem. They don't check the pictures normally.

can't argue with that
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:25:31
thanks i will try this at home with my Trezor. I just tried it with [ but it won't work there with your method. (signature starts with I, i tried to change it to J)

you certainly don't know what scam means
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:17:16
i think you have misread the question
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:18:24
yeah i saw that thread, but i still can't verify a message signed on my Electrum wallet with my Trezor Wallet. Why is that? Did I do something wrong? I can verify it on other Electrum wallets tho.

Bittrex also wasn't hacked yet if i remember it right
