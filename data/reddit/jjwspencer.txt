Thank you all so much for your input. The Freelance sites are of interest but what I really want is to get involved in a project I can be part of, that I can commit to. 
Nevertheless I shall follow through on these helpful suggestions - you never know where one door leads. Cheers all.

Thank you.

Who gets to decide "bad"?
@_date: 2015-06-25 23:54:00
Getting close. I had in mind charging for access!

I am going to save that comment - I just know it will be funny in a years time.

Promoting is all well and good, but this plan substantially accelerates adoption and at the same time offers a positive outcome to taxpayers for the next bail out.

Please do. Anything helps; its becoming clear to me that Bitcoin in china could truly be a people's thing.

I'm not going to slag the look of the site - doesn't seem any better or worse than many of the bitcoin sites. But I do like what the site is trying to do - which is to simplify the choice of tools and services available to help people into Bitcoin. That is surely to be applauded. 
However, there is something about the design which obscures this function. It looks far too much like it is selling something when instead it is doing something much more important than that. 
Could be a great starting point for newbies but needs gravitas and some means of establishing editorial integrity. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:37:24
Then you haven't been paying attention.

Oh dear. Full on rant there. Capitalism is how humans behave when they enjoy property rights and freedom under the law. A state I consider more natural than breathing but which is sadly denied to millions on this planet. 
Secondly capitalism only works when mutually agreed exchange takes place. Both sides of a deal have to be winners else there would be no deal. These freedoms are exactly what the blockchain should facilitate and support.

Perhaps when the Commonwealth fully grasps the way that the Blockchain could be used to manage various funded projects, they will be more interested in legislation that enables the application of the technology.

When you get a chance, remix the sound. Loved the line about the Canadians and then how many potential sellers you have created.

I see that CT have removed the article, but without any explanation. That, from an editorial perspective, is utterly unacceptable behaviour. I conclude that Coin Telegraph have zero credibility. Good luck getting that trust back boys.

Wonderful! Power to the Geeks. Fuck the system. THIS is what we love about Bitcoin.

Anyone stupid enough to support George Galloway in his absurd attempt to be elected Mayor of London is stupid enough to be ignored.

Paypal probably don't want to be associated with doing business with terrorist or human rights deniers.

You can tell they are Zionists from their names? How clever.

And your intellect is wanting. In the morning I'll stop being funny, you'll still be a dumb-ass. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 17:32:56
That might be your problem in your country, it isn't here. Here we need effective tools to prevent terrorist outrages. It is a matter of fact that more people would already be dead at the hands of terrorists had their planning not been stopped by GCHQ being able to monitor their communications. Also it's a bit disingenuous not to include in your stats the numbers who would have died had attacks not been thwarted by intel. Furthermore not all of the activities of islamists lead to terror attacks - look what islamists have done to your universities and your precious freedom of speech.

It isn't foolish to rail against the harm this traitor has done to our capabilities as outlined by the head of MI6 - but I suppose he is just a liar. The fact is that Snowden is a self serving traitor and the idiots are the ones who cannot see how much damage has been done to the West's intelligence gathering capabilities which will result in a loss of life.

Couldn't fathom how to get this file from Filedropper. Is google docs such an outrageous way to share a file?
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:27:16
Oh, because you all think like sheep?
@_date: 2015-09-11 18:09:41
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-04-02 10:19:14
Curious to know why anyone would give money to someone who has undermined our ability to defend our people from terrorist attacks. I hope the next atrocity could not have been prevented by intel.
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:59:30
I am sure that this is sound advice, but did it need to be so belligerently delivered? A gentler tone would help more, unless your aim is to berate and belittle just to stoke your ego.

Ask your boss if you can have half of the money you save over PayPal?
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:45:47
Absolute bullshit. I've used Wirex for more than a year now and on the one occasion I thought I had a problem their support got straight back to me. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 12:56:54
Haha, think you've blown your cover there. So how many muslims have the Jews murdered today compared with the number of muslims and non muslims slaughtered by these islamic monsters?
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:55:44
Well thanks but the org title was misleading.

What appeals to me is the security of the ticket. If this event is a must go event issuing tickets on the blockchain would make it possible to control a secondary market in the tickets or outright theft through counterfeit. 
Putting the issue of how tickets are paid for to one side, I can see that a very valuable application could be created to tie the ticket to a customer with validation using a smartphone which can be visually or machine verified at the gate. Always supposing there is WiFi :-)

But you think that spreading lies will fool people do you? What comment have you to make about the black slave trade, the Hindu genocide and the genocide of the Jews in North Africa that has been going on for 1400 years. Your defence of muslims is comic and a blatant deception. I'm guessing you are one.
