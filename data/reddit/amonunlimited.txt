If a country tries to make their own.  No one said bitcoin will be the only crypto around.  I have many different cryptos in my bag.  ��

Thanks ��I agree. We are on the ground level of something special.  I think... ;)

I’ll take a screen shot of your response and we will see in 6 months.  Who knows?!
@_date: 2019-12-15 17:57:33
I hope so too! I think it will be a very big year.  5x to 10x and that is a conservative estimate.

Even better.  Stack Em while you can!

Hahaha, me too.  I need just a little more.  But I’ve been saying that for the last 2 years.  Good luck to you on the gathering.  It will never be enough.  Hahahaha!

Very true, we all knew the risks before we signed up.  I’m here for hopefully the fun ride.  If not, I’m happy knowing that there are thousands of people in the world that want the financial system to change.  It’s a win/win for me.

Spider-Man.  It was a crazy scene.

Very good take and very true.  But the whole world is going to be wishing for bitcoin at 7,000 usd.   And actually owning a whole bitcoin will be legendary. It’s a good time right NOW!

Thanks, that means a lot.  We have a bunch of crypto commercials.  I hope it helps take crypto mainstream.

You're right.  There needs to be an easier way to buy and sell bitcoin.  It is still too complicated for the average person.  There needs to be a very very simple with easy explainations.  If you have any ideas let me know.  We make crypto commercials and feel like that is one way to make the public more aware.  Here is a coinbase commercial we made.  There needs to be more of this as well... [

Good article.  Even though things have been leveling out. . .I believe BTC will double its price in December.  OhNoVember and Double Up December.

It’s like this every year.   I’m glad we all have survived another crypto November.  ��
