Hell yea brotha man! Now we're talking!
I end up not even visiting this sub due to the common denominator here being so frantic 24/7 but as a day trader doing decent for himself (nothing crazy) I always saw there was no way btc would fall out of favour with how much money there is already for such a "young" boom. As long as my cryptos outperform my accounts and overtime outperform my retirement account I see no reason to leave. You can always buy early in a bull run as I say.. 
The only question for me is if it would be btc, in particular, that would surge forward and break ground while a better more ?stable? crypto would take its place but still hasn't seemed to have happened in the past two years. 
Funny enough I started bitcoin after starting a computer making business in high school in 2010/11 and with all the deals I got on gfx cards buying in bulk. It was as innocent as I thought the concept was cool and not for monetary reasons. Never in a million years did i ever think it would ever it $1,000 let alone $10,000. I distinctively remember asking my parents for $50 when btc was .50 in Jan of 2011 and freaked out when it hit $10 and sold off everything. 
Hindsight is 20/20 as they say but damn if that was not a rush at age 16.  
when did you get into the space? I've always been more of a finance/ business guy but recently with my off time been thinking about working in applied mathematics and cs possibly.
