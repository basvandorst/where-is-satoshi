But do you know who it is??  Are you in touch with other assault victims and are they on the path to getting justice?  Are the police helpful to you?  supportive?

Who is buying at 900?
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:35:58
I had a feeling to sell at around 1070 the other day but decided to ride it out.
Who's buying at 900 to sell at 1000 or higher?

Was the point to crush the  banking industry?  I must've missed that memo. 
No the point is to increase loyalty and reliance on the eco system and they are succeeding.

Yea but to get half twice or thrice the return on such high stakes is not for me. There are other investments to make that can get equal or higher yield in two years.

silly post, apple and google pay are still adding banks and merchants.    You can't call it a failed experiment when it has just gotten started and adoption is still growing.

Damn I really wanted to buy BT when the price crashed to $20 a few years ago but was broke, now I have a ton of money to invest but BT is sky high.

Whats the app being used for this touch bar live pricing?

I did some transactions recently, confirming I paid $0.10 for each transaction at various thousands of dollars.  The problem was that full confirmation took 40-60 minutes.  I'm happy about the fee and progress so not complaining that much but the confirmations appeared to have slowed compared to when I was sending btc before LN.  Im ok with paying 0.10 for that amount of time and know that it'll keep improving.  Overall satisfied.

Yea try to go send money overseas for free.  You don't do business internationally or deal in large amounts of money so it doesn't event affect you.  You just think it does.
@_date: 2018-07-03 07:58:14
