continued: Why don't you just send all funds which are sitting in temporary addresses right back to the originating address?
You could also easily check if there were Trades executed AFTER those funds arrived by checking the Bitcoin-24 account that own's the temporary deposit addresses. That shouldn't be too hard, trading engine bug or no bug.
If the funds are "untouched" and "untraded" (which they surely will prove to be!) then where's the fucking harm in sending the BTC right back to where they came from?

Which threats? All I see is a very angry customer. Noone needs to explicitly threaten Simon. I am sure he know's full well which kind of deep s*** he is in. And the even deeper pile of run-for-your-life-s*** he will be in if people WON'T get their BTC back. I don't even want to know what kind of angry guys are out there... I'm a nice one and would only send my lawyers after him.

+1 (except for the donation)
I have a significant amount of BTC sitting in 2 adresses which obviously didn't  make it to either the hot or cold wallet. (I sent them just minutes apart).
Didn't even know if I would resume trading when the site went offline. I have traded there before but that was a few days before the site went down.
Now I'm pretty pissed that I cannot withdraw my BTC because neither of these 2 problems apply to me:
- Trading engine bug, be it fixed or not (Simon claim's it's been fixed)
- The polish SEPA account lockdown (I don't have EUR there).
Now how can I get to my funds? SIMON, HELLO???
How about writing you an email, claiming the funds by naming the 2 adresses and signing that email with the 2 private keys to prove my ownership?
I am really getting impatient here. I am sure as hell not waiting until all that SEPA chaos is cleared up, which may be months from now!

Yes, tracked 2 deposits of mine to this address:
That seems to be the Bitcoin24 cold storage wallet.
