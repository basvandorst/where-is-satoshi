Do you see any problems for people doing kickstarter-style fundraisers in the future? Like say you do a decentralized dropbox via "storage coins," raising $1M worth of BTC and then scaling to a couple million users and a decent amount of revenue. 
Won't regulatory authorities catch up with you at some point and throw the book at you?

It's very complicated and getting clarity on these things is a big part of the Swarm legal action plan ( In fact there will be a big summit at Harvard Law School in January on "Crypto-equity and the Law," where a bunch of lawyers come together to help figure out what is feasible and what isn't.

It's true that we face a very significant hurdle in explaining how these technologies can be used to provide a benefit over existing crowdfunding. A lot of the technology is quite new and so it's a bit tricky in that often you either need to explain it (painful) or hide it (perhaps easier).
The other much larger problem is that most of the things that we can do easily with the current technology (like issue dividends on profit) are almost certainly illegal. The time that it takes to resolve legal issues is way way longer than it takes to make progress on tech, which has been a major setback to us.
But we are making substantial progress all the same.

I don't think anyone has not been able to vote, it's just that they have to wait to receive their voting tokens at their wallet. So there is a delay of at least one block. Which can be frustrating, but it's just the way things are in order to make it secure.
