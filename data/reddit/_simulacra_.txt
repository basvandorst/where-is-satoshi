It's a token/mechanism developed by Bitfinex, to make it easier to arbitrage between exchanges and as a secure token to swap into during downturns without having to go to fiat. All this shit from Bitfinexd, it's like saying they staged the moon landing. There are easier ways of scamming the system, you don't need a token, just like ripple.

If they want to scam the system, they don't need tether. They could set any number of silent internal buy orders, fake order books etc etc. Both easier and impossible to track. This is why the SEC won't allow ETFs. Tether is infact the most transparent way of getting around banking regulations.

I'm just going to cut and paste this. *What do you think is happening dude? They have 30 bank accounts in case one gets shut down. They onboard money into where-ever the fuk will let them on that day. Including high net worth individuals etc. Then they print tethers instead of moving that money. Do you know what the risk is of not using tether? They move the money, it's flagged, the account is shutdown. That is very risky. Very actual risky, like 30% if this keeps happening we go out of business risky. Do you think core developers wanted high fees and slow transactions? Do you think Bitfinex wants tether? It's necessary, for now.

Lets take it one step further. If you were running bitfinex, who usually lag in prices btw, what would be the ultimate way of increasing the price? If it was me I'd make a bot. Any resistance points it identifies, you randomly make the bot either break a resistance point or defend a support point. Set it to action after dip. Ez. The idea that you'd launch a crypto token pegged to USD, then announce to everyone when you deploy it, so you can then scam the system, worst. scam. ever.

Right. Were you complaining mid december when $500M were created in a day right into a crash? Or before that when more were printed and the price did nothing? Or when Bitfinex's prices were constantly lagging other exchanges the last few months? Is it ideal? No. Does it serve a purpose? Yes, it's really the only solution we have around the banking industry. How do you think exchanges and big buyers can capture arbitrage while banks ban them?  I get it. Tether's are a centralized risk, though some bankers might argue less risky in aggregate than bitcoin. This market is full of conspiracy theories when obvious answers are sometimes the most likely. Bitfinex. Does. Not. Need. Tether. To. Manipulate. Their. Own. Exchange.

There's plenty of meaning. Price doesn't correlate with number of transactions. People are buying in and hodling. Transactions as a use case were always a red herring for price appreciation. Higher velocity = more downward pressure on price. A hodler will have a x10 impact on price compared to the same btc being used to spend.

From Sapiens? As a bitcoin hodler how inter subjective truths are spread, his example of the Sumarian "articles" versus the amercian declaration of independence was great (although i'm not amercian!). The perspective on how we treat animals, how that's rationalised etc, resonated pretty powerfully. Guns Germs and Steel was mostly that you'd rather be lucky than good, in terms of how countries get rich etc.   Both such amazing frameworks for contextualising life though.

It is, but some big pieces of risk were driven out this year. That's not even including risk driven out from China, CME, Bittrash hash attack, bittrash community split etc etc. There's a bunch of people shepparding people away from investing at $10K, or people still putting in $20 with much hand-waving. We're past that stage now. This is actual early adopter/majority, 10% positions, $10K instead of $20 etc as more rational risk appropriate moves.

@_date: 2019-12-26 05:21:25
That is honestly a good thesis, covering a bunch of relevant themes. Kudos author and good to see some knowledgeable commentary in here.
Asset Rotation
The asset rotation theme is pretty interesting. As you say,  I think it's clear 60/40 folios will be less useful into the future. There's no sign interest rates can or will rise, so bonds are basically dead money. This is a basic carry situation, when you can borrow at low rates to buy higher yielding bonds until borrow rate = bond rate. So if you're an asset manager holding bonds, where do you cycle? Let's not forget that's $40T in bonds (just in the US) looking for a home. At the moment funds are loading up on private equity, but that's always been a smaller illiquid market. It can at best act as a temporary solution to finding yield. The other point you didn't mention is the squeezing of growth stocks. From 2009 you had FANG. Probably the best secular growth trade in 30 years. Huge macro growth trend. In fact it was Amazon putting out a warning downgrade of revenue growth that popped the market in sep 2018. So not only do you have to replace bonds, you have to find the new FANG equivalent theme that drives the market. This year it was a rotation into value. Target, of all things, is up 100%. IMO value cannot carry the market, no one is going back and buying Walmart, McDonalds and transport stocks as a core holding. These are just quarterly rotations. Look at the generational folio holds from the new Schwab asset report, basically all FANG. With a the minor difference that Boomers own Berkshire and Millennials own Bitcoin (although only GTBC was recorded). So as FANG slows, more and more marginal dollars will be pushed into riskier asset classes.  
Hodler Math 
One other theme I look at is the idea of critical mass in crypto, that is viewing hodlers themselves as the market. Obviously the halving is a piece of this idea. The larger theme is a bunch of new mechanisms are standing up to absorb supply, either interest bearing products like Blockfi or rewards systems like Loli, traders, bots etc. Even Ratuken is allowing the conversion of rewards points into crypto now. It's possible new sectors like gaming with integrated sats/lightning, also gambling games, will act as new structural sources of demand. The question is, what/when is the critical mass? At the moment about $4.7B per year of supply needs absorbing. Next year obviously there's the halvening which will halve that rate. If you run the math between new supply absorbing systems like Blockfi, loli, etc etc hodlers will only need to absorb $100-$200 to put a floor on price. At the moment it's about $500-700. Regardless of the particular figures, the trend is pretty clear, I think we cross critical mass at some point in the next two years if we haven't already. Where there are sufficient hodlers in and of themselves to drive the price up slowly. What is interesting is what happens after that. If Hodlers can consistently absorb supply and drive long term 5% uptrends, Bitcoin becomes the new bonds. There is infinite demand for an asset that appreciates. The question is, how long does that take to prove in the market. Because it could take 10 years and none of us want to wait that long. 
Chinese Money
One of the other larger macro themes is Chinese money. There was a shortage of fund managers in Hong Kong in 2017/2018. Alot of Chinese money is locked up in property, Chinese property as an asset class is about $20T compared to their share market at $4T. That's compared to the US at $40T retail property versus $30T in equities. So generally speaking we should expect a rebalance out of property from the Chinese as they become more sophisticated investors and also as their property market caps on the equity it can absorb. Also they have to fund pensions, since the system we live in has decided that pensions will be based on investable asset yields. So "Chinese stocks good", which we've seen with the performance of companies like Alibaba this year, their Hong Kong listing and what that's done for the share price. But big chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent are reasonably mature stocks, they can't absorb $10 Trillion in Chinese cash that needs a home over the next 5 years. The Chinese government is trying to fix this by issuing equity in state owned chinese companies (Rail, power etc) and literally giving those shares to under funded pensions. That will go a big way to filling the gap (and satisfying Trump that state owned companies are infact privately owned via equity). Companies like Chinese Electric Corp, Chinese Rail are some of the largest holders of CAPEX in the world. So breaking off shares from those entities and putting them in pensions will materially add liquidity to their pension system. Even still, the amount of Chinese money that needs a home adds to the desperate search for yield, too much cash searching for too few assets world wide. Which brings up the final point that Bitcoin is perhaps the only truly global liquid asset. So some Chinese money, Korean money, Japan money etc will flow in. Even if takes a Hong Kong or Singapore futures or ETF over the long term. Baakt have obviously just setup their Singapore futures operations over there. 
As is always the question with Bitcoin it's not if but when. When is critical mass, when will the market learn there is a floor on price. When does it demonstrate itself to be a mechanism more suited to savings than fiat. Super wide window, but I guess that's the opportunity for long term hodlers if you can stomach the uncertainty.

I mean... if you spin up a bunch nodes, organise 90% of hashpower to migrate and call it an upgrade, a bunch of people are going to call it an attack, which is all that's important. 
I get it, these businesses optimise around throughput, short term block increase versus slippery slope of wanting more block increases wah wah. Bcash satoshis vision wah wah. If they want throughput they should install segwit wah wah. 
The reality is there were 46 billion transactions this year, growing at 10%, and if we try and put them on a chain it doesn't work. Each block is fuking enormous. Noone can download the backlog when they try and run their own nodes. Noone can even process the nodes they have if they do download it. Let a lone when AI's come in and we need 1000x. Sometimes you have to measure twice cut once, take your time, get it right and execute. It's shit but that is the roadmap, forcing the issue at that point just fuks everyone.

Been a stock trader for a few years. Lot of stocks attract a certain type of community. So in silicon for example, there's the smart/conservative types who look at trends, technological advantage etc they buy into Nvidia. Then there are the types that go with their emotions, they believe in turn-around stories, good things can't last, prices are too high etc etc. In silicon they tend to (loudly) support AMD. Every dip is a buying opportunity, every failure brushed over with what's just-around-the-bend and the next magic innovation. Forget relative market position, network effects, profitability, technology or basic logic. When I was getting into crypto first thing I thought when I saw the bcash crowd was holy fuk all the amd guys are here. Shakeout is nvidia guys are up 100% this year and the amd guys are down 10%. Mr market is slow but he gets it right in the end, that's when you find out who is swimming naked.

Most relevant valuation themes are Lindy Effect (trust increases over time), Metcalfes law (value of a network increases as a square of the user base) and stock-to-flow (hardness of an asset determines if and the size of the monetary premium it can command). There is no current consensus on what makes bitcoin valuable. Those three are very good valuation themes to understand.

Ya there are two issues within that though. 
1/ miners/business delivering ultimatums 2/ downstream effects from larger blocks (on a/ miner centralization b/ node minimum requirements). 
With regard to ultimatums, you can't use coercive power on a system designed to resist coercive power because even if you win you break it.  You prove bitcoin doesn't work and that special interests can take control of the system. So fuk b2x being forced on the community and this isn't even mentioning the idea of replacing the core development group, which is about the stupidest idea i've heard in this space. 
With regard to big blocks threatening miner centralization, there is a bunch of new big miners coming so it will look much less centralized than in the past- don't see this as a big deal. At least to the extent it will get better than what it has been. 
With regard to bigger blocks raising the minimum requirement for nodes, as long as someone can download and run a node- for me personally- i don't mind. That transparency is ultimately what i want, rather than arbitrarily declaring we will maximize the system around the smallest possible nodes so that people without many resources can run their own node.  
Personally my order of preference would be:
[hodlers] &gt; [new applications] &gt; [transactors \ mining] &gt; [minimum spec nodes].

I think it's only when they're Losing just astronomical amounts of money and credibility through this process they will learn. Users will remember, anyone on the wrong side of this is the jp morgan of bitcoin going forward. Doesn't matter what the setup of the situation was, you can't apply coercive power to a system setup to resist coersive power, you either win and prove the system doesn't work, or you lose, so it's lose lose.
