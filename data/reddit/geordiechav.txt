Yes. He is so overly claiming that compared to the guy who used the word maybe. 
"They found out halfway that Bitcoin is way too hard to use for the average Reddit visitor is my guess."
Someone guessing what it might be deserves to be downvoted to oblivion. You are right. And what else can i be than a shill for pointing this out. Typical shill behavior. Paid by the banks.

Awefully quiet in here. 
The truth about their druggie hero is gonna be very inconvenient for a lot of people in this sub. And as always with Bitcoiners they prefer to ignore things they don't like. 
But let's man up and discuss this on the mainpage, ok?

I'm sure there aren't. Because everyone knows it's a scam. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:13:38
Uhm why?
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:21:54
No way you're gonna deny now that A LOT of people in this sub support Silk Road and consider Ross a true hero for what he has done. Statistically way more than non Bitcoin users. Just no way.

Stop trolling please.

You mean like the top comment with 40 upvotes and pretty much every other comment in this thread?
But what you really are saying is that you don't allow speculation here and if you do see it you will punish that person by downvoting him. Correct?

Trading is pretty much the only thing Bitcoin is being used for at the moment. 
You'll also most likely lose your money.

He is right imo. Censoring people you don't agree with on the internet is kinda pathetic. I understand one would use it to fight spam, sure, but "i'm gonna downvote you because i don't like the way you talk" is just ridiculous. And sadly that's what the downvotes are mainly used for. It gives people a certain power they don't have in real life and guess what, it gets abused. 
A smart person has no use for downvotes. He can handle the internet without having to censor other people. And that's why i never downvote anyone.

No way i'm gonna read that all but whatever it is i'm sure it's a scam or will eventually turn into a scam. This is tge most likely case with new companies dealing with Bitcoin.

There were more buyers at 1000 then there are now at 250. 
People aren't interested in low prices as you can see. It's a sign of weakness. They will start buying if they see the price going up. 
And no matter the price, anyone can buy as much bits as he wants. You can buy 10 dollars worth now or at 1000. 
The price going down is not good for user adoption. I know many here want to believe that but it's wrong.
