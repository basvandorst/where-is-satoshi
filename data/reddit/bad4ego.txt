No morning habits do not have influence on Bitcoin. It is supposed to show you similiarities of successful people in their industries. To help people succeed in life and business. These interviews focus on people in the Blockchain and i have another playlist (and book) for outside the blockchain.  Also he agreed to the interview (both of them) and questions abouthim before (even though he seldom does which is why its rare). Stop making assumptions and try to defend your point when you clearly missed what the interview is about and for. Or what else is coming. Again understand they are for BOOKS that are coming out. Thanks :)

Interesting. EVERYONE asks the bitcoin questions, you can see those anywhere! As stated in the interview the questions are based on the book The Crypto Factor. vol 1 and 2. vol 1 He talks about bitcoin (email interview) this one is for volume 2 and wanted to see more about Andreas and the the similarities of successful people in the space (Mini spoiler alert, many same similarities  are found in Bitcoin that can also be found in successful people and companies!). If you want to succeed in life and in industries as a whole you should reverse engineer the way people think and their mindset. Open up your train of thought. Some friendly advice for a not so friendly comment. ;)
