Do some people buy bitcoin because they see other people do it and the increase of value? Yes they do, it is in our nature to speculate and in that sense you can twist many things to be a speculative bubble. 
To me the real value in Bitcoin is that it changes the architecture of money. We have seen time and time again that our current system is broken, most recently the 2008 financial crisis. It has been proven that we simply can't trust our money in the hands of intermediaries. It also seems that rather than correct the issues, we continue to temporarily patch them up with bailouts (our tax dollars). The banking system was great and has served its purpose, but times have changed and its time that we evolve with them. In my opinion, BTC seems the be the best option out there at this point in time. So the real question isn't how high can BTC go, but rather how low can our fiat system go? 
Also, keep in mind that where BTC is now is very early stages. When the internet first came out, people needed to spend thousands of dollars on a machine and it literally took days to send an email effectively. At which point in time the majority of people had trouble making sense of it and stuck to traditional mail. Lets be a bit more farsighted, lets try to erase our ideologies and fears and use our imaginations for the greater good. 
Regardless what happens, if we can build a system where the top 10% stop stealing the majorities hard earned money without consequence, I'll consider that a win.
