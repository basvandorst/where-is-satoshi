In my opinion, Bitcoin price will raise, so i think it's a good time.
@_date: 2016-08-23 09:25:47
I heard that blockchain wallet is not safe enough
@_date: 2016-08-30 12:32:21
Bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. Coin - it is coin.
@_date: 2016-08-22 14:25:29
Good advices! At the moment I'm using Blockchain wallet, but looks like I need to use hardware one..
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:52:25
Yes, it is a great advantage :))
@_date: 2016-08-25 08:29:08
I'd like to know it for sure)
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:11:32
I see your point :)
@_date: 2016-08-18 09:44:43
I think, they should give you credit without problem - you have a good reason :))
@_date: 2016-08-25 08:25:59
Sounds really fast!
@_date: 2016-08-10 10:48:42
Interesting idea! Bitcoin is perfect for online games.
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:49:56
The charm of Bitcoin is that it's not obligatory to use it if you don't want to. But if it is convenient for you, Bitcoin is always ready to help)
@_date: 2016-08-30 10:45:06
Very nice story, thank you!
@_date: 2016-08-23 11:00:30
I believe in the future we will use simple and convenient wallet which will be safe the same time...
@_date: 2016-08-25 14:19:36
Interesting, let's see what will happen next
@_date: 2016-08-10 12:24:43
I agree, LocalBitcoins is the best solution for you.
@_date: 2016-08-18 09:33:14
Maybe even right now is perfect time to go all in, who knows :)
@_date: 2016-08-22 14:57:07
But how exchange should work if it's not allowed to buy (and as I can understand to sell) BTC? Interesting..
@_date: 2016-08-22 14:06:30
Now I'm also interested, why we shouldn't use it:)
@_date: 2016-08-26 08:13:52
Good point, I agree with you
@_date: 2016-08-23 09:10:10
In this case, it would be nice to find something average if it is possible )
@_date: 2016-08-25 07:51:07
Okay, thanks for this information!
@_date: 2016-08-31 12:10:46
Good point, Bitcoin is unstoppable! 
@_date: 2016-08-26 12:51:11
In this case I'm calm
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:05:23
Thanks! Simple and clear answer :D
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:24:58
I hope no O_o
@_date: 2016-08-31 12:36:12
I think that a lot of people exact under the illusion :)
@_date: 2016-08-30 10:50:58

@_date: 2016-08-24 08:38:05
Thanks for your recommendation!
@_date: 2016-08-24 09:44:57
Maybe on Android wallet is safe, I don't know :) 
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:31:13
But what is the easiest way to send Bitcoin for people, who doesn't use the computer every day?
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:21:21
I'm not sure that she will be interested in holding bitcoin)
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:15:04
Yes, looks like you are right.
@_date: 2016-08-23 09:11:10
Thank you! Do you know some good wallet for Windows?
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:51:21
Actually, she has a cell phone, so maybe we will check if it is simple enough for grandma to use it, thanks! :)
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:10:31
I think we will pay with our fingerprints
@_date: 2016-08-24 08:36:49
Oh, thank you! Is it safe to use such extensions? 
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:02:59
I agree with you :) I just want to know if there're any advantages for my grandmother if she will use it. But looks like, it's better if she'll use cash.
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:59:59
Maybe you're right. А lot of young people do not understand how to use Bitcoin and find it too difficult
@_date: 2016-08-23 07:13:57
Thanks for your reply! I think I should go and find some good offline wallet)
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:51:04
You can never know for sure, sometimes there are delays
@_date: 2016-08-24 10:00:18

@_date: 2016-08-26 07:59:26
It sounds logical
@_date: 2016-08-25 14:28:07
Unfortunately looks like you are right..
@_date: 2016-08-26 08:09:03
It's a little bit weird I think..
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:37:12
Hope it's not because I've said that maybe right now is perfect time to go all in :))
@_date: 2016-08-26 12:44:58
Who doesn't trade anymore :)
@_date: 2016-08-23 10:54:11
Thank you, I will take a look at bitcoin.org 
@_date: 2016-08-24 09:48:24
I see your point, I think will try to use different wallets and it should help me to decide 
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:38:52
Thank you for advices, I should be more careful!
@_date: 2016-08-30 13:20:55

@_date: 2016-08-30 10:57:58
)) I think you close to the truth
@_date: 2016-12-14 10:15:13
I am also on the level 2 of your graduation. Currently it is not possible for me to avoid fiat, so I combine using Bitcoins and fiat)
@_date: 2016-12-14 10:05:15
Cool, the future is coming :) 
@_date: 2016-09-16 08:47:40
Nano S has a lot of great features and it's definitely cheaper than Trezor, I agree with you :)
@_date: 2016-09-01 13:12:49
Such a good news

I've never used KeepKey, is it convenient to use such device?
@_date: 2016-09-16 14:52:13
Yes, we don't need any banks to store our bitcoins, you are right
@_date: 2016-09-13 13:05:13
You can use Bitcoins :) A lot of Bitocoins.
@_date: 2016-09-13 12:05:44

@_date: 2016-09-14 11:46:48
Bitcoin is absolutely bitchin' :D
@_date: 2016-09-15 11:15:53
What's the reason to sell $100 card for $70? Sounds like something illegal.. Should be some trick in this scheme
@_date: 2016-09-16 11:17:34
I think the best part is that the people will get clean water :) And it shows that anonymous bitcoin can be used in good ways
@_date: 2016-09-16 13:11:27
Interesting, what happens when all the Bitcoins will be mined..
@_date: 2016-09-15 10:34:28
Blockchain-based game - sounds interesting! I will take a look at this game.
@_date: 2016-09-15 09:11:34
Yeah, it sounds really strange :D
@_date: 2016-09-15 13:08:44
I am thinking about purchasing hardware wallet in the future as well, thanks for your reply! Looks like Nano S is a great wallet, but it costs like 4 HW.1
@_date: 2016-09-16 11:03:48
Yeah, Bitcoin have a lot of problems as well so far
@_date: 2016-09-15 11:29:35
Bitcoin ATMS would be awesome in other countries as well :)
@_date: 2016-09-15 09:34:33
I think this is the best solution in such situation. 
@_date: 2016-09-01 11:18:39
It is a big day for your business, good luck! ;) 
@_date: 2016-09-15 11:22:44
Unfortunately, there is only 1 way to mine with PC - use time machine and go to the past with your PC..
