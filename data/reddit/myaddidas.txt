He's doing it to himself again. Got to give it to him though, he's not pulling any punches.
I respect the guy and have read a few of his economic papers, but it's hard to teach some old economist new tricks. The concept of a currency not backed by a government and no central bank is inconceivable to many of them.

Great point, I've been wondering this as well. How could one dude implement such a high tech coin? He has one of the best DAG implementations out there. He has an AMA coming up soon and I posed a question about why we should trust him as a lone dev.

Umm, no. That's not the same as increasing the Bitcoin money supply. Mining increases the money supply. Reducing the smallest tradable unit doesn't do that. 
Creating a $.001 coin does not increase the USD money supply.
Edit: if the government did create a new $.001 coin and pumped it into the economy, then yes, money supply is increased. But your example of reducing the smallest unit is more equivalent to the government creating ten $.001 coins, putting them into the money supply and simultaneously removing 1 cent ($.01) from the money supply. Net increase in money is zero.

I think you have some nugget of truth in there in that humanity would go through a very rough patch as it adjust to the new normal of no central banking authorities, then maybe adjust as we become less consumeristic. But we would likely would bring out the pitch forks before we get to the holding hands / kumbaya part.
I don't know about your idea of global kindness emerging.  I think history would  just repeat itself first. The haves will dominate.

Great reply. Folks should take time to understand what you've said. It's important to have alternative opinions expressed. 
Economies run on deflationary currencies would prevent the government from priming the pump during recessions. Keynesian economics would be a thing of the past. Fiscal conservatives, and I'm guessing many Bitcoin enthusiasts,  would argue that this would be a good thing. But, they don't understand the implications of removing monetary policy levers from the economy during tough times. Real people will suffer as unemployment shoots through the roof.

So he talks whiskey in the post, does that mean he was drunk? He went all over the place with his rant. Which made it more awesome.

Satoshi worked with a small group of developers on the implementation and release of the core code. This guy seems to have done it alone. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:54:53
Please explain why you think economic stimuli (is that even a word? Lol) are harmful. The great recession was shorter than it would have been if we did not go there. Also, it did not lead to inflation, despite conservatives' screams that it would, and national debt as a percentage of GDP remains manageable. (Raw national debt is not a good measure.)

"“Unfortunately we really overpaid, because bitcoin went up about 20 or 30 times. So we learned our lesson — we don’t spend our bitcoin, we’re long-term holders. We think it’s a store of value much more than it is a currency.”
Last sentence is spot on.

I'm not saying Bitcoin should become deflationary, I actually like this whole experiment. But it's clear to me that making Bitcoin THE transactional currency for a country would lead to serious recessions in said country like we've never seen before. Bitcoin should be one of several cryptocurrencies that dominate.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:48:23
I think the best thing to come out of this overall set of responses to OP is that many BTC holders dreaming of BTC taking over USD now have a dose of reality and can hopefully think more rationally about Bitcoin's future place in the world of assets and currencies.
It does not need to take over the world, it only needs to find its niche.

Thing about Austrian school is that it shuns rigorous economic analysis. It's tilts more towards social science and theory. In general Austrian theory rejects government involvement in the economy. Say what you will, but booms and bust will be even more extreme with no government involvement. First world economies do need the occasional referee.

You're sadly mistaken if you think Bitcoin or any deflationary currencies will replace fiat, especially in first world nations. Central banks do have a roll to play to mute wild swings. Recessions will be a lot worse with deflationary currencies. All of this Hodling is good for you and me, but bad for economies as a whole. Money needs to flow in prosperous economies. Hoarding is anti that.

Or a fast low fee substitute like Litecoin or RaiBlocks.

It's not possible to implement economic levers in Bitcoin because it was created to be a limited supply currency not "managed" by any one entity.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:49:24
If this is done after the final 22 million Bitcoins are mined (or whatever the heck the number is),  then you'd violate one of the core attributes of Bitcoin: deflationary.

Unbelievable. That's too bad. Makes no sense since most other states allow it. As if Minnesotans need more government protection than others. Ridiculous!

If you exchange fiat with someone you don't know, then kyc applies. Ask local Bitcoin people who've been arrested. It doesn't matter which technology you use to do the exchange. 
Look guys, I don't care if you down vote me or call me childish names. I just want to engage in healthy open dialogue about potential consequence of the technology.
It's good to hear all points of view.

In the US you are NOT free to exchange ALL personal property. There are laws around people exchanging currency, laws against money laundering, heck, you can't even sell your house without local government involvement and taxes. That's the price of living in a society where rule of law reigns. These laws were put in place over many years. 
Now, if you want to change these laws, go ahead, that's what our elected representatives are there for.
@_date: 2019-03-03 17:02:10
We are not totally free.
I'm guessing you're a libertarian wanting absolute minimum amount of laws? I don't agree with that political philosophy, but acknowledge it as an option that a section of the American public prefers.

KYC scams? Really? Like it or not, KYC is part of the law of the land you live in. I find it interesting that BISQ suggest that you create a separate bank account to fund BISQ fiat trades in case the bank gets suspicious that you're trading cypto with an unregulated 3rd party (not doing KYC and evading the law). 
You have to open yourself to KYC when you open your fiat bank account, so what's the big deal that you need to do it for crypto?

If quantum brute force becomes possible, hacking the ETH blockchain will be the least of societies concerns. General banking systems will be be targets as well.

Of course you can. You buy BTC at one price, sell it at a higher one, boom, more fiat currency than you started with.
Now if you're saying one shouldn't count such a profit, that's another discussion.

I certainly understand and agree with your point from a financial theory point of view. Increased purchasing power is a measurement that's currency agnostic and therefore the best guide for true value. 
However, if you look at it from the point of view of what has my Bitcoin position meant to my actual ability to buy things in the real world right now, then you must take conversion to fiat into consideration. Right now fiat is what we all need to buy most of the things we need (like it or not).That's why people are obsessed with converting it to USD. They are not long term traders and want to lock in real world profits. In that context, you don't "make" money until its locked in to your fiat of choice. 
Personally, I think the price of Bitcoin does not yet reflect its potential value in the next 3-5 years, so I stay invested.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:31:59
Did you actually sell? If not, you didn't make any money. HODL!

I was dollar cost averaging since August. At about 8,100 I said F it and dropped the remainder of my BTC investment budget in one limit order.
My ETH position was similarly fully established at 365. My lifestyle won't change if I lose it all, so I will ride the rollercoaster without stress. Just need some popcorn...

This article is a good overview of the potential scams of Tether and Bitfinex: 
In the end though, a collapse of Bitfinex likely won't be a disaster for the cryptocurrency markets. May cause a dip to 6Kish before all of us HODLers pounce on the dip. (And boy do I want to see 6K again.) 
According to the author of the Medium article, most of the USD withdrawals from Bitfinex could likely be between a small group of people who have ownership stakes. Most of the volume might not be coming from real traders, but from insiders:
"This small group of people could be trading among themselves while taking positions on other exchanges, such as Bitmex, Bitstamp, etc, and literally moving the price anywhere they want without actually buying or selling anything on Bitfinex by just wash trading with each other."

My definition of making money is increasing your fiat currency balance. So having a higher BTC balance is not making money. Bitcoin is not currently a highly accepted form of exchange so I think fiat is still the reference for hard profit for the time being.
