I completely understand your fear of volatility. That said many people in this space do well by DCAing (Dollar Cost Averaging) into their bitcoin position when the price is up or down. 
Have you considered moving 1/4 of a bitcoin each week away from RH and to a different platform to reduce exposure to risk?
Some weeks the price will be up and some weeks it will be down. 
On the other hand I can understand if you are more concerned about the short term taxes you would have to be when shifting your positions. 
You would be on the hook for short term capital gains which would be hefty given your lottery winnings this year. 
If you hold for 365 days, you would significantly reduce the taxes long term gains which would be dependent on your income. 
Or it is always possible that RH builds out a crypto platform by then and allows you to withdraw your coins to another platform, the transfer to yourself would have 0 tax consequence.

You also might have some interest in GBTC, it’s the only “stock” that is backed by bitcoin and can be purchased within a brokerage, retirement, or Roth account.

No, you don't pay similar fees. They are magnitudes lower than that. You have choice as a user to use a wallet that allows you to select your fee. 
Sure, it can vary depending on how much you want to pay for quick approval. Users can check the network and figure out what they need to pay for confirmation based on current demand,  Relative to one another these fees are minimal. 
Anyone with a bank account had to go down to the bank or website to set up an account as well. Does that hassle outweigh the benefit of being I. The banking system (no). 
PayPal and Venmo. Ha, come on. From a consumer side, I've barely used PayPal to ever pay friends (hence why they created Venmo for P2P payments. 
On the merchant side, google horror stories of using PayPal - you have a high chance of getting your funds locked up for months because you don't fully control your money and don't even get me started in the fraud levels PayPal has. I'd rather receive bitcoin knowing it is going to make it me some time today and once it does I can spend it the same day. 
I guess Venmo is solid for P2P, but you still have to wait on the delay of the ACH system to confirm your money makes it into your bank account 2-3 days later (possibly longer). 
Bitcoin allows you to control your money, transact trustlessly because once you send money there is no calling it back, and if you did your research you would find Bitcoin is the most secure financial network in the world because it is nearly impossible to hijack enough computer power within the system to fraudulently spend a bitcoin twice.

I could be wrong, but it sounds like you do not believe in the tech whatsoever. So I'm not sure how much a discussion is warranted. 
More than that fiat cash is participating a monetary system that devalues the currency that you have in your bank account and investments each day, week, month, and year. Bitcoin is deflAtionary because it has a cap of 21 MM coins. 
The international transfer and payment business is worth a ton of money. Literally, just one example is Santander and 10% of its profits are from the transferring of funds. Never mind all the other banks and business like western union. 
A. 
B. 
At BTC's core, you do not need to or exorbitant fees to move your own money. 
On convenience, you must not have friends who have bitcoin wallets. You just take a photo of a QR code and send the amount owed in seconds.
Again, I've got to confirm that it does not take longer to send and receive bitcoin than PayPal or Venmo. Once that money is on its way to your bank account, it will be pending for days before it clears. You send me BTC now and I'll have this afternoon and I can spend or send it where I need to. It is a multitude better than ACH. 
You are correct the value of bitcoin could decline but it could also increase in value. 50/50. If I'm a merchant I can automatically sell BTC for fiat currency to eliminate fluctuation risk. 
Overstock holds 50% of the BTC they receive. 
Again on fees, bitcoin is nowhere near 3%.

Absolutely has. 
Anything is possible...who knows!?

Your last point is the most interesting. 
An hell I don't know...I'd be more pissed about missing out on gains of 95k per coin than losing 5k, 10k, or 15k. 
I personally, I'd gladly take the risk with the possible reward. If you win, you can cut out decades of work and ira contributions. If you lose, you're young and have time to recover. 
And I'm am utterly biased based on my allocation.

I'm going with rich being 3 MM plus, keep the same lifestyle and not have to worry about working if you don't want to. 
Sure you could, but 58k for the rest of our life is not likely to be even a middle class lifestyle for 40 plus years. Need at least several hundred ks to move to Columbia or whatever.

Good to know that situation but it doesn't apply to 99.5% 
So the tax situation for nearly everyone who is not a professional trader then...below is truly all that matters. 
Keep it simple.

Buy or sell with limit orders. Make sure to in click "Market" for your order. 
As a market maker there is no fee. If you just buy or sell at the market rate, they charge you. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:17:18
You'd be rich!
But there's no better time to take more action and move forward than today.

Nice. Damn dude, I'm with you on wanting/needing more!

Still going? Yeah..at an 8.5 billion dollar valuation and a CEO who is worth 1.5 billion at the moment. 
You should really check out sending $500 bucks today, it will work really well. 
I do hope you’re easing back into the trade here.
