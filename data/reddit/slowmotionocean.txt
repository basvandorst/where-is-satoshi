There's a Latin legal term you can use to reply, I believe it's "go fuck yourself".

It is complicated, but that's the way USD works, unfortunately. The good news is you only have to do it a few times, then you're all set to use BTC!

It's weird how we were able to have all of those things for 137 years before we had a permanent income tax.
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:33:41
That's an interesting comparison!
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:12:55
3/29 = 0.10344827586
So what you're saying is it could go as low as $2068.97?

I hate to break this to you but $20,000 was the Moon.

You might be waiting quite a while before you can sell at 9k.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:56:37
In a few years 19k could very well be the new 2k.

Bitcoin is up 204.35% since last year. Over the past 5 years it has outperformed Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:48:24
How can I get rich from Bitcoin even though I'm broke?
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:24:55
Yeah there's no way price manipulation could have been responsible for Bitcoin going near vertical last year. There's no way the true price could be $1000.
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:11:36
Right now we are confirming resistance at the top of the downtrend channel.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:20:58
What is your price target then?
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:34:39
It's PHP written by a Java guy.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:01:38
He didn't buy Google either.
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:15:35
I know I would have if I were Canadian. He was temporarily hilarious and hilariously temporary.

Oh, good lord, they're using Scala AKA the bastard child of Perl+Java
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:17:33
I was betting on alcohol.
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:00:27
What do you think it means? Price too low or too high?
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:35:41
Ah, but does Bill Maher consider himself at all times to be a White person?
@_date: 2018-10-11 21:48:45
No, they actually "allowed" withdrawals for months after that. They just got stuck in limbo.

$53 premium at Bitfinex is making me nervous.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:32:43
Does it make me a bad person to hope for that too?
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:50:36
Unless the price is a scam. If the real price of BTC turns out to be $200 again good luck holding your own coins.
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:39:03
Instead of buying something on it, why not sell something on it? Give someone else a reason to use it.
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:56:30
@_date: 2013-06-27 20:18:33
The term "colored" is considered offensive. It's acceptable to say a coin is biracial.

Once again, the conservative, sandwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor.
@_date: 2013-08-06 16:58:58
That's true. You can be jailed indefinitely in that case as you're "holding the keys" to your own cell.

There's nothing wrong with centralization when it's optional.

The word bogus originally described a counterfeiting machine. Ripple is literally bogus.

I read that as "ham reduction" and about had a heart attack!

I think it was a joke.

If those dice were part of some professional tournament we'd be gawking at that too. I like watching poker players.

That's a loss of 5 cheeseburgers. Fuck.

It's not. Even if it were it would once again be the common folk paying a dear price for the misdeeds of the previous generation of those who lord over them. But it isn't chickens coming home to roost. It's overlords of that same ilk playing games with history and nature for their own perverse philosophical pet theories about social engineering and cheap labour. In the long run everyone loses but them.
@_date: 2013-08-07 22:23:09
Pretty much. It's very loosely based on a book called *Make room! Make Room!*
@_date: 2013-08-30 12:57:29
Criticism is tiresome. Bitcoin is serious the way a gun is serious. It can't be stopped and it doesn't need to worry about putting people off. It doesn't need to be warm and fuzzy and safe and inclusive and not trigger any of your feels.

I could care less about the correct phrasing :-)

You can't eat gold either.

Hey what OS are you using?

I agree that mtgox should be removed.

Wow over Magic cards... that's fucked up.
@_date: 2013-08-01 14:04:55
If that's true then how do you explain the conspicuous lack of dairy farms near railways, and the hugely disproportionate rate of infertility and miscarriages corresponding to high-speed travel?? These are all documented facts but you'll just ignore them and say I'm joking/trolling/an idiot/a conspiracy nut. Or you'll trot out some anecdote about a pregnant women traveling safely, the old "just because some miscarriages happen to occur on trains doesn't mean trains are unsafe or that all women will miscarry" OF COURSE NOT, I'm not claiming that they ALL will, just that there's a correlation! That's what STATISTICS means. Augh!

A lot of folks selling coins are mining them. They need to pay costs and take profit immediately. They think the best way to allocate capital is in mining rigs, so why would they put that value on ice in BTC?
@_date: 2013-08-30 23:39:03
I merely deny them the essence of my Bitcoin.

Low value or low price?

There's something else I wanted to vote for, but I put all 6 in for BTC anyway because BTC adoption is more important.

Sorry. My others are all knock-knock jokes.

To survive, Israel must become an imperial regional power, and must effect the division of the whole area into small states by the dissolution of all existing Arab states. The hope is that sectarian-based states become Israel’s satellites and its source of moral legitimacy.
