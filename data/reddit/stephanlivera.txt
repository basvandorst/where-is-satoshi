As he mentioned in the interview, he thought the forks were going to kill Bitcoin back in 2017. Now those of us more deeply in this space didn't think that - but at least it sounds like he's coming around to Bitcoin again, so I'd say cut him some slack here. Everyone makes mistakes, and he's at least admitting where he changed his position and thinking on it.

* I'd look into Samourai Whirlpool - see Pura Vida's guide here: [ 
* note though that Samourai's Ricochet feature isn't a coinjoin, it is rather there to place 'distance' or some level of obfuscation. It makes more sense to use Ricochet when going into an exchange, rather than coming out of one
* If you like listening to podcasts, I'd recommend a few of my episodes on bitcoin privacy - SLP58, SLP78, SLP29, SLP117 - website here: [

He did nothing of the sort, all he does is talk over people and not let them speak. You should count the number of times I was interrupted mid flow

* Lightning Network is a payment channel network enabling sending of (typically) smaller values using BTC - this is how most retail users and merchants, and even exchanges will eventually interact with each other in the future because of cheaper fees, effectively instant confirmation etc. Lightning Network channel opens and closes are standard layer 1 bitcoin transactions. 
* Liquid is a side-chain, it's intended for use by exchanges, trading desks and some other financial institutions to quickly move BTC around exchanges quickly (shorter block times than bitcoin). It offers some slightly different (arguably better) security trade offs too. It doesn't expand the supply of BTC, you 'peg in' and 'peg out' from BTC -&gt; L-BTC. It also uses Confidential Transactions so this helps mask the amount being transferred. Right now, when a whale is moving a large amount of coins cross-exchange, this can be spotted on the blockchain and it may be 'front-run' by other traders. So now, using Liquid enables participants to move large blocks of coins w/o necessarily 'tipping off' the rest of the world with a huge on-chain bitcoin transaction.

Thanks Chris

yep, I just dropped this ep last night - we talk about some of the responses to Plan B's S2F model. 
Ideal if people have listened to the first two eps - SLP67 and SLP86
@_date: 2019-08-09 11:57:48
haha yes, just note I was specifically asking on this point to nail that point home. I've been to a bitcoin hardware wallet presentation where the presenter suggested that he only checked the first and last few digits. So I wanted to really make it clear to the listeners just in case that practice is commonly taught.

I think the cheapest + easiest way to put this all together is using myNode - listen to my interview here: [
Short version though:
* You can either buy it as a premade device, or buy the parts cheaply and self assemble (RasPi 4 4GB RAM, 1 TB HDD, 16 gb microSD card) - using a sdcard flashed image
* It's all scripted together to set up bitcoin, lnd (for lightning), and electrs (electrum rust server) - it'll take about 2 or 3 days for bitcoin IBD, then another 2 or 3 days for electrs
Then once it's set up, you use Electrum Wallet from your laptop/desktop PC in the home network, and 'point it' to your electrs on the mynode. Now, you've got hardware wallet security combined with full node validation.
The premium version of myNode ($99 for a licence) also includes VPN/TOR so you can do lightning tx on your mobile while you're out and about.
@_date: 2019-08-20 03:52:41
SLP100 for 10% off - code valid for just under a week from now
@_date: 2019-10-27 21:56:25
Thanks, I'd suggest going with coldcard and use an sd card to air gap it. Then you've got a pretty decent full node and air gap set up. If you don't know how to do this search Matt Odell coldcard - he did a good coldcard+wasabi guide. Then you basically do a similar thing but with electrum.
@_date: 2019-10-18 10:42:32
Basically it helps stop somebody from stealing funds on the lightning network (particularly useful for mobile lightning wallets) - listen to my interview with Conner Fromknecht of Lightning Labs who did a lot of work in helping design and create watchtowers

It would require a dramatic reduction in the size of the government IMO

hey man, fair points. I only realised later that SLP75 was actually not as 'newbie friendly' as I thought. Will keep that in mind for future 'newbie episodes.

Congrats to the Samourai Wallet team on this! I'm excited to see more options that enable bitcoiners to pair their mobile with a home full node for improved privacy combined with a fully verifying node.
@_date: 2019-06-03 08:57:53
I would point Peter Schiff to my article on [mises.org]( [
Put simply, he is not considering the overall benefits to the global economy of *removing the government's control over money*. He is naively comparing the gold production cost to bitcoin's entire operational cost, not considering the issue that gold is more easily centralised (so you either pay for the gold to be physically moved around, or you risk the increased centralisation and co-opting of the gold standard, just as the government has done).

* Some of the myNode community members are working on getting Samourai Wallet's Whirlpool into myNode, look out for this over the coming days
* Otherwise, I'd recommend looking into Ronin Dojo by BTCxZelko, he has set up some pretty nice automated scripting
   * Ronin Dojo Github page [ 
   * Ministry of Nodes write up [ 
I quite like Samourai Wallet suite of running Dojo (own back end for your phone SW app), whirlpool-cli (perma running on the raspberry Pi so it can do freeride remixing while you're out and about), and whirlpool gui on desktop to check the status on mixing etc. 
I used Zelko's command line guide to get Dojo working on a Raspberry Pi 4, works great

Great, now next step: Running your own node to validate the tx and balance. One way is to run your own electrum server, and use Electrum Wallet with your Ledger to check the balance and to do tx with.

There's not a lot to be made on the lightning network in terms of routing fees these days so would be careful on that part.
Obviously I'm bullish lightning in general but important to set the right expectations

Bitpay are the ones using BIP70 which is not recommended practice. Bitpay are the ones at fault here.
@_date: 2019-12-24 14:03:34
This is mostly right, but there is some sense in which running your own node helps 'defend your chosen rule set' of bitcoin.   
Though I think it's not a good idea to push this notion that for 99% of people using only ledger / trezor is fine. Bitcoin does in some sense rely on enough people running a full node. Some bitcoin core devs e.g. Luke Dashjr believe the number should be something like 85%+ of bitcoin users should be running their own node for it to work longer term.
@_date: 2018-11-03 08:21:03
afaik, yes the standard way to do that is: it'll download the full block chain, and then prune it back. So you'd still have to do an initial download of the full chain. 
Unsure if there are ways to 'only download the pruned' sections.

Lightning Network works by opening payment channels to other nodes on the Lightning Network. So in the process of opening that payment channel, you're putting bitcoin into that channel. This is what people are referring to with 'adding Bitcoin to the lightning network'. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 10:09:21
thanks mate
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:05:41
Adam Back touches on this in my interview with him - the basic point is you'd verify the block header through another channel
