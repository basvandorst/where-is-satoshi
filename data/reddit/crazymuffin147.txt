I don't care what lenin thinks about fiats, that quote doesn't even concern fiat currency, just high interest rates and inflation (which are actually the opposite of the problem for the US.) I just want you to show me what bitcoin is backed by (because you think that makes a currency somehow better as opposed to security and ability to trade for goods and services.) Bitcoins are fiats without the benefit of being secured by a trusted source.

Fiats are terrible but bitcoin is DIFFERENT!

Penny stocks do have a protocol built around then. It's called a stock exchange, the sec, etc. Don't get cunty with me with your passive-aggressive smileys. Bit coin isn't a currency for the same reason stock isn't a currency. And calling a fatal flaw of the system a feature is idiotic, moronic, and shows you have no idea what you're talking about. It's a shame really, what a wasted opportunity.

Where'd you get your economics degree
"You cant reach stability without volatility first"
This is demonstrably wrong

As if bitcoin isn't less than a fiat currency.

The USD is collateral and used in almost every large monetary transaction

Oh I'm not referencing myself, to me bit coins are just an extremely volatile stock gamed by predicting the fears and delusions of self confident amateurs. No, some sorry son of a bitch lost 50k. No pity though, people who act like bit coin is a threat to the dollar need to get their head out their asses. It's penny stock. People don't realize the huge faults of the system, such as if one producer of bit coin ever established a majority, they could say any transaction never happened.

Unless you're that sap that lost his son's college savings in a day. Bitcoin kicks ass at neither
@_date: 2013-08-22 23:59:12
And then bitcoin crashes and you're scrounging and saving
