Let's not be too quick to defend Charlie Shrem. It pretty obvious that he was engaged in nefarious activities and did so in a blatant and sloppy way. He is not someone I want representing the future of Bitcoin. HSBC may be bigger criminals than Charlie, but all are criminals nonetheless.

You're not getting your coins back...

I doubt he is a real person.

Someone needs to work on their penmanship.

Fucking hell, are you really that paranoid? Buy and sell to people with good reviews. Simple. Usually if you are buying a good amount of coins (+$10,000 worth) you are going to be buying them from someone who is very involved in the BTC community, probably has stellar reviews of localbitcoins, and want repeat business from you, hence he or she will probably not shove a gun in your face. If you are selling them, it doesn't take a genius to determine the authenticity of bills...buy a kit.
Unless we are talking a SHIT-TON of cash and BTC, what you are proposing makes you seem a little...paranoid and crazy.

What I mean is, I think he does not exist.
