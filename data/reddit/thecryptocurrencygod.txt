Theres nothing to learn... people either win the lottery in life... buying millions of bitcoins at .05 or being born into a mega rich family. The haves and the have nots. Welcome to social darwinism..only the rich survive. And poor become slaves and do not survive.

I new bitcoin would crash once credit card companies changed credit card purchases as cash advance... and started banning credit card purchases!!! Makes no sense at alll... i can buy gold, cash, silver, etc on ebay with a credit card, but not bitcoins?! Lol

Also noobies cant participate in the market anymore, such as myself since they banned credit card purchases... its going to take years for the market to recover.

If you cant critical think and predict what our future might look like with the technology we are investing in, you probably shouldnt be investing in it.

Not when everyone thinks 1 bitcoin will be worth $1,000,000. At the rate we are going now, 1 bitcoin is going to be worth $10 in month...

What if we are the last true free Humans of planet Earth, before the owners of the world enslaves future Human generations into the blockchain technology with a microchip implanted into us?

Well if it doesnt stabilize at $10,000, i highly doubt it has the potential for growth. 
That sounds like pump and dump

I wonder how much American tax dollars are spent each year alone in interest payments to the privately owned Federal Reserve?

Its down for everyone who didnt buy it at 960.5. You would have a different attitude if you bought it at 20k.

Bitcoins needs to stabilize atleast at $10,000 for me to believe it has potential to go higher...
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:09:09
Isnt blockchain technology the same as the new world order?
In the future, people will get chip implants that will track everything...

I see. Thank you for your optimism. I have struggled and have been beat down too much staying optimistic about anything... its much easier for me to be a realist, as I have 0 expectations about anything.
