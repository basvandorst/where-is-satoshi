Interesting quotes: 
"I never desired to be a leader but the choice is not mine. We are a product of the things we create. They change us."
"If Satoshi-chan was made for an ACM turing price or an Alfred Nobel in Economics he would let you bloody know that."
"And the market creates solutions. Don't impose. Allow the market to operate. There is more to come you have not foreseen yet."
" "Identity" is not your name. Where people go wrong is that they do not see it to be the set of shared experiences with other individuals. As a result it is important to see that name and identity can be separated. You can maintain an identity not associated with a name."

Either they (Wright and co) planned this extremely elaborately by faking the information and leaking it (then pretending to create mystery by denying it and acting suspicious) or he was part of the creation of Bitcoin.

Imagine if he really is Satoshi. Everyone goes from listening to a genius then completely ignoring him and doing the equivalent of looking at cat photos. The human condition at its finest.
