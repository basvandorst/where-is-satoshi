Yeah, I went to a meetup this past summer and I gained new perspectives and ideas. I’ll host a meetup next month. I just need to figure out how to reach out to bring in bitcoin maximalists who have been in for a while. I only have a year in myself but it’s been a really special year! Of course noobs would be welcomed but there are so many! I live in New York and I overhear noobie strangers talking crypto on the subway and in elevators lately.

I have just looked at your invitation. It seems like you are off to a good start, and based on the flyer from September, somebody there already knows how to plan a party but here’s what I would advise for someone that was an absolute noob at throwing a a party. I don’t know why all of these are being listed as  but whatever. 
You want people to comfortable socializing. So if you have a space with adequate seating, plan it for there. If you have some folding chairs, it’s good to have them there folded so people can unfold them and sit down where they want to. Beyond that, 
1. Snacking gives people something to do to break up their talking.  Have a variety of food-not just one type. Something salty/savory (pizza, chips, cheese &amp; crackers. If you get pizza, dominoes usually has inexpensive deals, and if you ask them to cut it into as many pieces as possible, they will slice into tiny squares and rectangles, which is great for parties) something sweet (cookies, brownie, kettle corn - if you buy those tubes of cookie dough, you can have cookies coming out of the oven during the party) and something for vegans or peolplewho are dieting (sliced carrot, green pepper, celery, and hummus. Alot of hummus, because people will put crackers with it too).
2. Same thing with drinks. It can be nice to have some flavored seltzer like LaCroix on hand for people who are dieting or don’t drink. Otherwise, beer (Modelo is a respectable low budget standard) and wine (if your town has a Trader Joes wine store, get some Charles Shaw shiraz).
3. If you live in a cold climate, figure out beforehand where everyone will put their coats and woolens. Maybe on a bed if there are not enough hooks. 
4. Clean the bathroom and make sure it’s got toilet paper. If you  are short on time and can’t do a big cleaning, replace the bathroom lightbulb with a dim one, or take it out and hang white christmas lights to make the bathroom dim, 
5. Think beforehand about a playlist of upbeat music. Why not go old school and put on some Kraftwerk? I recommend “Mr. Roboto” by Styx- it could be about Satoshi! The music should be low in volume- you are not at a music show, this is a party. You want people to hear each other talking.
6. Consider a way to dim lighting in the main space. Don’t use the overhead flourescent lighting that your kitchen light switch turns on. In fact, tape that switch down, and turn on the bulb above the stovetop. String some white christmas lights around. This is not neccessary but it can help people feel more at ease. 
7. This next bit of advice is advanced level- if you anticipate girls, and there is any possibility that any girls might sleep over, you may want to make it easy for them. Have a box of unscented medium sized tampons in the bathroom cabinet for women visitors. This is something men who entertain women visitors should have anyway, party or no party. If there are women coming in an out of your place, one of them will need one eventually. If you live in an all male household, you can just say that someone who used to live there, or someone’s girlfriend must have left them, if anyone questions it. It’s also not a bad idea to have condoms and toothbrushes still in the package- a package of multiple toothbrushes with some already taken out seems unassuming. And clean towels are always nice to have around. You don’t want to miss the opportunity for a sleepover guest because the girl needs something at her own home.
I really wish I could go, but I’m too far away.
But I may have talked myself into planning a party. 
Have fun and learn new things!

I really do wish I could come. I also love documentaries and talking about crypto.  I have two friends into it, but it’s still hard to talk about with them because I don’t have time to think about altcoins and I’m into psychology and economics much more than computer science. Bit having written that long post to you makes me think I really should try and have a meet up this winter.

I’m sorry I can’t link it here but I recommend reading the Times article. It’s a weird piece of literature. It’s garish and grotesque and even sort of comical.
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:44:06
I had heard the word for years, and was dimly aware that it was some sort of computer science project involving money. I knew that there was a subreddit about it. I went to a business school (Baruch) and I knew it was addressed briefly in some classes, although I didn’t take any of those classes. Eventually a friend told me in depth what it was (in 2016) and I started to consider it, watching and reading here and there and taking in what I read. I met with another friend and asked what he thought. We talked each other into getting in.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:39:31
Yes. When I get closer to doing it, I will. Thanks!

Tell her to read Piere Rochard’s essay on Speculative Attack. Then she’ll know how smart you are. (I know how smart you are btw).
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:22:44
People believe that all of the investment in bitcoin will perform something called a speculative attack on the dollar (and other currencies). Read some definitions of speculative attack, or read Pierre Rochard’s essay about it. I don’t think most people are even aware of what they are doing, but it’s possible that people, by trading loads of dollars for bitcoin, are making bitcoin more powerful than dollars. If this continues, it renders dollars worthless and bitcoin the dominant currency.

Honestly, you should travel while you can. If your life positions you to travel for a year, do it. Travel freshens and expands the mind.

Nice to meet you by the way. I have two real-life friends (male) who are into this, but much more of my learning and thinking is stoked by people who blog / vlog online. Sometimes I find gems on reddit, but much more often I am stimulated by youtube or essays on the nakamotoinstitute.org.

I want to retire. I’ve worked for decades and I can’t get ahead. I no longer believe hard work and study lead to a good life. As someone once said in Showerthoughts: “ When you think about it most jobs themselves aren’t bad. It’s just that PEOPLE are assholes.” Yes, yes that’s true. I don’t want a lambo. I want trailer or a tiny house or an apartment. I want to spend my days enjoyably. I want to read and study and sleep and laugh.

Tell her to read some essays on speculative attack and hyperbitcoinization. She’ll be all in.

I’m a woman. I am holding, I’ve learned through experience that it can be frustrating to talk to people about btc, so I save it for people that I know can deal with it. I send one text to an old friend informing him that there’s a dip if he wants to buy. Otherwise, just “talking” with redditors about it, and that can be kind of rough and ignorant too.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:59:43

You don’t need to buy a full bitcoin. You can buy like $10 worth if you want.

I agree that people seem focused on gain, but he’s saying that it gives him hope for the future. Life can be painful without the hope that it’s possible to improve one’s circumstances. I think a lot of people feel no hope for the future and this guy feels gratitude that he can climb out of the hole.

Yes, the Wired article is a great resource, but don’t let panic overtake you. It’s the panic itself that will interfere with successful recovery. I don’t have a trezor, but do I understand that if you can remember the pin you can get back in? From the Wired article, I seem to remember that the subject could enter multiple tries but was that the trezor made him wait long lengths of time between attempts. From my dispassionate distance, i think that if you created the pin than you will be able to get it through multiple tries, it just may take a long time.

Your situation parallels mine but I am even more extreme. At around the same time I caught on to bitcoin, my middle class career imploded. I found myself jobless and literally in the breadline. I moved through a series of whatever minimum wage jobs I could get hired at. I bought my first satoshies while working part time for minimum wage in New York City no less. That small bit is now a much bigger bit and of course it will increase many more times over. I have a hard time imagining what my life would be like without the feeling of hope and safety it has provided me with. I am still very underemployed, but I still try to buy some satoshis every payday and make up for it by living on the cheap. I am considering work such as teaching English abroad or being a live-in nanny for a wealthy family just to get as far ahead as possible before the “Wall of Money” (Wall street traders) comes in like a tsunami and takes the value into the sky. I feel like I’m trying to make a life for myself in the traditional ways (I attended the best universities I was accepted to, I’ve always been trying to improve my resume, I’m sending my resume anywhere and everywhere) but I have yet to get ahead in this economic and social climate. Only through doing this weird thing that some people think is silly (buying bitcoin) do I actually expect to survive, and hopefully eventually thrive.

Because determining the value of art is so subjective, there have been money laundering operations that used art dealers as a front. But it seems really doubtful that organized criminals would blog on reddit, so..,good on you for helping the ecosystem grow. And the funny thing is, bitcoin is like an art sale. The value of a bitcoin is determined when that bitcoin is for sale, and the “value” is whatever the highest bidder will pay for it.
