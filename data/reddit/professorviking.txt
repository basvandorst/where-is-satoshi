So and :
I understand your argument now is that XT is an alt because of... reasons. Reasons I dont understand, but reasons which you act like should be obvious to every casual bitcoin user.
Some pretty smart people seem to disagree with you that XT, or forks like it, constitute it as an alt. Why do you personally get to define what is and is not an alt? Why not allow the discussion. 
Personally the definition of "if it has the same blockchain/ transaction history, it is a fork, not an alt" seems pretty reasonable. 
Also, how do you define "consensus"? Because the way I understand it, nothing happens with XT until a 75% consensus (which seems frankly pretty generous to me) and trading platforms/ miners would decide which fork to roll with shortly after.
Is every fork that becomes active before 100% consensus an alt to you? Because that seems like system that is broken at the foundations. Like the UN. When everyone has a veto, nothing will get done.
All in all, these discussions and explanations should be happening in a sticky. Make these discussions and definitions as open and transparent as possible. 
I just don't think you guys are treating this discussion/ decision seriously enough. If you try to blow it off, its going to blow up in your face.

Boom. Now we are getting somewhere.

I assume you would allow all discussion of XT if they changed it so it would require 90% to become active?

So here is what I am currently doing 
Downloaded drakdoo on play store
1: Look at current price. 
2: Set up alert that will alert you if the price goes 4$ above the current price, or 2$below the current price. Do not change alert until it goes off.
3: When you get an alert, buy a set amount if it went 2$ down, or sell a set amount if it went 4$ up.
4: repeat from step 2. Adjust the numbers as you see fit if the alert is going off too many times in one day. 
I set my numbers at 2 below and 4 above to ensure that I will be buying BTC at about twice the rate I am selling BTC.

Yes. I did.
Things can change in 4 years... with Bitcoin, things can change ALLOT.
Again, the scenario outlined here requires an active bad actor that was absent in 2012, and the mining economy is vastly different now than it was in 2012.
Again, perhaps nobody tries an attack like this, and miners will make gradual changes so that the profit model does not change so drastically. Id even say its a good chance. 
But if the chance is even 1% that this can happen, it is a problem worth solving. And unfortunately, it say the chances are much more than 1%.

If someone smarter than me could give this a listen and give this a summary, I would appreciate it. 
I started to try to do it myself, but rather than misrepresent the arguments, ill just quote the rest of the shownotes and provide a link where some of this is discussed.
"the ability to short Bitcoin and thus benefit from an attack will increase dramatically. We take an in-depth look at the anatomy of such an attack including: - How an attacker would need to go about shorting bitcoin - How the kamikaze mining pool could be used to bribe miners to join the attacker - Why all profit-driven miners will have an incentive to join the attack, whether or not they believe it will succeed - Why the block halving in 2016 could be an exceptionally dangerous time for Bitcoin, since an attack would be cheap to execute and likely to succeed - How a gradual decrease of the block reward, instead of the 4-year halving rhythm would reduce risk 
Links mentioned in this episode: - Bitcoin Development Mailing List Thread - Death by halving: 
There are a large ammount of trolls on this subreddit claiming this is all a circlejerk, but when people downvote this thread without likely having done anything more than look at the title and see it as negative for bitcoin, it gives credence to their claims. 
I am not a concern troll, but if there are fundamental problems, they should be discussed so that ideas might flourish as to how to correct these risks with side-chains. 
If someone smarter than me listened to the episode and said: "I am not worried abut this because points A, B, and C, are rendered moot by points X, Y, and Z." I would also be very happy.

One argument he made was that you wouldnt do double spends, You would just mine empty blocks and have other people in your pool mine empty blocks. This would aparently prevent transactions (though people could still sell to places like coinbase for reasons I dont understand)
Since BTC is so unregulated, the person doing the attack could actually advertise their attack. They Could post online that they are doing the attack and your options as a miner would be to either join the mining pool mining empty blocks and get paid (not in BTC) for doing so, or try to mine valid blocks out of pure alturism, as, directly after the blockchain reward is halved, mining wouldnt be profitable anyways, especially with the rist of the attack succeeding. 
People on social media would freak out, try to find ways to cash out, then you make bank on the short.

And why/ how do you expect it to increase?
You cant predict what the BTC price will do on a specific day, only that in will eventually increase. But you do know exactly when the reward gets cut. 
right now, miners are spending 80% of the BTC they earn on energy consumption, with only 20% going into actual profits. 
If that equation remains true in 2016, then mining becomes unprofitable... Unless the halving of the reward also causes the market price of BTC to double for some reason I can not fathom. 
Mining would eventually become profitable again, but the day after the reward is cut in half, if miners shut down their hardware until the market is more favorable, someone else can start a new pool and offer to pay those miners with unusable hardware to mine empty blocks, and pay cash for doing so.

First, in 2012, you did not have the situation where so many people are renting out their mining equipment. a bad actor would not have to buy 51% of the mining power, he would just have to rent out 20-30% of the hash power to become noticed, and convince others to join him by paying them in cash. He would try to create a domino effect and incite panic among the miners by saying "This is happening, join me and make what you can while you can".
Second, in 2012, BTC was not really worth the effort such an active bad actor would have to put in to make this work. It may be 6 months from now.
I thank you for your response though. I hadn't considered your first point.

I want many wallets not just for storage, but for gifting and dedicating to specific financial goals.
@_date: 2015-03-31 12:39:36
I haven't used cold storage with mycelium yet.
Is it possible to have your cold storage accounts listed under "my accounts as watch only accounts so we can see the balance for our cold storage accounts?

I wanted paper wallets because I like to segregate my savings based on goals. 
But I just realized I can create many HD accounts on Mycillium. 
So I could create 25 accounts labeled for certain financial goals (home gym, new tattoo, tiny home, etc...)
As long as I have my 12 word phrase kept safe, is this enough? Is this secure? What if Mycelium goes out of business?

Why does anyone need 5$ to mess around with?
Linking a coinbase account with a bank account can be a pain, but they give you 1$ for free without needing that. 
have them sign up for coinbase, get a mycelium app, and have fun throwing milibits between the two.

There should be no mismatch since you would be paying the exact amount directly after the purchace... no cash would be pocketed. Only BTC.
The money laundering thing might be a thing. But that accusation could be made for many BTC transactions.

One of the appeals of BC, is how international it is. You need a standardized international system to go with it. I'd think the last thing you would want is for it to become more regional


"people" have, but not "The People". By that I mean, generally, the stupid masses who do not like complicated systems... like me I suppose.


Thats what I found when I Googled "bitcoin denominations" Thats what everyone else is going to do when they come into it fresh. If its stupid and you have conflicting non-standardized systems, you gotta change that.


What country are you from? I learned metric for like a minute in school, then largely forgot it because I never used it. "USA! USA! USA!" and all that jazz. It sucks, but it's reality.

Nope. Dont put words in my mouth. I never said that is what worried me.


Supply will not go down. Bitcoins do not crawl back into blocks.
You really don't understand the points being argued.
@_date: 2015-03-11 04:03:59
Thats a great link, thank you. Also, ironically, the best argument ive seen for why a 51% short wouldn't happen. 
Becoming a monopoly miner would be far more profitable in the long run than burning and shorting. 
Of corse... then it would be centralized. Just hope someone we like does it. Someone uncorruptible.

Good answers. But we need a better naming system then. For the layman, people need to understand that .1BC= X, .01=Y, Etc....
Nobody is going to say "Ill give you 0.0000000000000001" or "0.238767492374 BCs"
Also, in the future, things should just be rounded to the decimal point.
By that, I mean .0007 instead of .0006938295729
Its easier for the mind to grasp "that apple costs 7 x-coins"... or whatever the hell that should be called. 
I know it may seem like a silly point for some, but naming the denominations and making those names widely known to the public will go a long way towards wider adoption and usage. If, with deflation, numbers just get bigger and  bigger to the right of the decimal point, I think it will decrease spending and adoption, for no logical reason than it is unfamiliar to the common mind.
Looking at that, it seems crazy confusing to me. Perhaps Im just stupid, but you gotta pander to the stupid for greater adoption. 
I think naming should be intuitive. For example, call each domination Z0, Z1, Z2, z3, ect... "z" here is short for "Zero" and indicates how many zeroes are after the decimal. 
So, 1 "z0"= .1 BCs, 1 "z1"= .01 BCs, 1 "z2"= .001 bcs, 1 "z3"= .0001 BCs.
That way you can say a price of an apple is "4 z6s" instead of .0000004 or 4 "bitcoinbongs"... Seriously, who is actually going to say "bitcoinbongs" or "centibitcoin" in everyday use and know what the hell in means?
Actually, I think Using letters would be better for the denominations. An "a" coin= .1BC, a   "b" coin= .01 bc, and a "c" coin= .001 BC.... so 7 "f coins"= .000007 BCs. Lettered coins just roll off the tongue, and you will always know which domination is worth more just so long as you know your alphabet.

Is this similar to a dark wallet? If not, what are the differences?
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:42:31
I think what happened was I went to a coffee shop and signed into CB on their WiFi. It didnt trigger a new sign in then, but it did later since I was on a different IP address.
Sooo... it looks like I will have to start the process over every time I check or use CB on a WiFi that is not my own?
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:53:18
well at least SOMEBODY thinks im innovative.
