Awesome!  Congratz!  I'll get there someday!  Some nice user sent me $0.20 earlier and that was my first transaction ever

Do they all sync together?
@_date: 2014-12-13 02:46:58
So it's not possible anymore?

That's actually exactly what I did!  Circle is really nice and looks awesome and I also tried coin base and that looks really good too and I'm torn between the two):

What are your thoughts on the Xapo wallet?
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:29:44
Thank you very much! :)
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:08:20
Done.  I'm sold

What about just a QR code the customer could scan right at the counter?

Are there any sites you can buy bitcoin with paypal or any other way besides linking a bank or credit card?
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:27:54
This website is awful on mobile.

Yes, I know it's not a real bitcoin and has no value in BTC, but I still think its neat
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:55:28
I do not see it listed there.  I did a quick google search and it looks like she got it from amazon, still cool though!
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:30:23
No, it's just a fun little coin thing
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:16:04
I've never seen this before but after watching it, it's amazing

My bitpay wallet has a bch feature. Right now it's saying I have an equal amount of btc and bch (it's old). Is my money doubling?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:35:16
What are some reasons not to use it?
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:20:30
How are you doing it? Is it difficult to get? How did you convince older people to accept them?
