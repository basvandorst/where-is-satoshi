kat.ph is cuter, but it indexes fewer torrents as far as I can tell.
I use adblock on TPB, though, so that doesn't bother me.

You wouldn't.  That's the "problem" with bitcoin right now.  It's worth more as an investment than it is as a currency.  I'm part of the problem, but I have no shame about it.  I'm along for the ride until bitcoin plateaus.  I enjoy being invested in something that could play a very significant role in internet-based transactions in the future.  It's like betting on a ball game; it makes it interesting.
A lot of people in this thread are completely missing the point that it simply makes more sense to buy something with fiat and save your bitcoin since it has a track record of exponentially increasing in value.
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:26:52
I honestly don't.  It just seems interesting to me that MtGox maintained the community's trust for so long while being a USD (and now BTC) black hole for some time now.

Coinbase = you can either hold the bitcoin or cash it out as USD.
Bitpay = BTC is instantly credited to you at market value in the form of USD (you never hold the BTC whatsoever).

there's nothing we needed more than a shitty wordpress layout for the official poster page of bitcoin, especially when we had a nice, full-width, well organized site before.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:48:51
I have a question.  Why has MtGox been sustained as the de-facto standard of bitcoin trading even when they were pulling dogshit like holding USD withdrawals well through early last year?  
@_date: 2015-01-29 01:18:24
In all likelihood the poster and the author are the same person that trademarked the symbol.  No one else would have a vested interest in something so trivial.

Wow, I'm really glad I found this article on a website that obviously stands to gain from a pro-bitcoin agenda to tell me with certainty that Apple Wallet will not kill Bitcoin.

Because payment processing costs money.  It costs money to have an acquiring bank assume risk.
The fee still is 1%, however there is now a new player who has to make money, the payment processor.

You can completely ignore the GPIO pins and a Raspberry Pi is just a plain old tiny computer that can run Linux.  It's not quite like Arduino.

The literary tool lies within the fact that "Raspberry Pi model A" (optionally with "nigga" appended) is a comprehensive solution to this problem, the story starting and ending therein.

What if they tried to push themselves as an avenue for easily purchasing and maintaining Bitcoin, similarly to Coinbase?
The risk of someone withdrawing is like the risk of someone having a 0-balance bank account for PayPal, no?  Perhaps banks allow overdraw?  I don't know.

Yeah.  I was also hoping for something that multiplies bitcoin and sucks my dick.  Cool Arduino project though.

If anything we're at media attention.
If this isn't a normal bubble, however, we may see nothing but growth.  Bitcoin isn't a normal speculative bubble because it may eventually represent a new standard in payment methods, rather than being purely speculative.  What does [this chart]( remind you of?
But who knows.  I certainly don't.

I used to attend an online program through the K12 Virtual School network that handled courses using the same course provider as the one OP's school uses.  The screenshot proof they posted checks out.  I very distinctly remember the fonts and the layout of the grading system (*Lesson Points Possible, Points Earned, Teacher Comments,* etc.).

Nice.  I really like this.  I'm into purple.
What is the "chart" on the back?
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:16:38
Not quite sure what you mean.
Why would a user need to prove that they donated a certain amount?  
If you have a web store, typically you'd be using some kind of integrated payment system, associating "tokens" with payments that attach payments to their respective orders (go to humblebundle.com, hit "pay with PayPal", then look at your URL bar and hover over the purchase details on the left hand side to get a better idea of what I mean).
Is that what you mean?  Because for something like that to work you'd need to use an API like Coinbase's or Bitpay's to integrate bitcoin with your shopping system and effectively "prove" transactions.

What stops Amazon from accepting Bitcoin on their own?  
Amazon has a history of spending lots of money laying groundwork for the future.  Short of competing, if (here I go with more ifs) Amazon was to buy out a small player like Bitpay and incorporate it into Amazon Payments, that could be the play that pushes Bitcoin into the mainstream.  Amazon could *be* that player.
Again, I suppose it's about the volatility.

Because offline bitcoin wallets are typically used for live transactions, right?  Just like how you walk into the store and whip out Bitcoin-QT or Armory on your desktop?  How many things have you bought with Bitcoin in a store?  Why would you be using anything other than your cell phone for these kinds of transactions anyway?  Doesn't it seem kind of convenient that it has internet access, a high resolution display to show QR codes, and a camera to read QR codes?
TREZOR, in all its $100 glory (I don't even know how much it costs, I've seen 3 different prices in this thread alone), doesn't function as a live transaction system either.  It's a fucking cold storage device, just like Pis are used for.  The only thing we have right now is that one debit card thing with the proprietary POS readers.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:33:45
Except that trying to move with trends in a market like bitcoin may as well be gambling, and with so much volatility you can't really chalk anything up on a daily basis unless you are actually a serious day trader.
You're right, but there no use thinking that way with bitcoin for most of us.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:38:09


My thoughts exactly.  PayPal adopting Bitcoin would be huge.

Why not just use a program like Armory/Electrum and back that up to a USB drive and/or paper wallets?
Serious question.  I've been keeping my shit on Coinbase with 2FA, however have been doing more and more research on different methods of storage.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:07:18
What do you mean?  If some entity had access to your account, don't you think they'd be stealing your bitcoin rather than earning you referrals?

I prefer Newegg's selection and site design.  TigerDirect's site is too focused on cutesy splash pages and bundles, whereas Newegg is more barebones and makes it easier to search by specifications.  I also think their "Rosewill" brand is a decent line of products.  Using an RK9000 keyboard right now.
Either one would be great, and as you pointed out, they are direct competitors.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:01:24
Didn't even know that exists.
Isn't that more of a gift-card model, though?  It's hardly a virtual currency if it's only redeemable at one site.  Support for Bitcoin allows them to capitalize on and perpetuate the existing currency rather than just giving gift cards a new name. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:54:34
I don't understand.  How is TREZOR any different from a Pi with Armory and offline transaction signing, outside of the substantial extra cost?

Why is it foolish?  Coinbase themselves, is the liability, right?  They *claim* that everything is stored offline with redundancy, which is certainly more secure than keeping my shit only in my own house, no? It seems like they're the only ones who can screw me.

I'm telling you that this person attends an online school.  I am in severe fucking doubt that they'd include something so unusual in a fabricated story to get 1500 text post karma and 8 hours of attention on no less including the mismatched formatting of a copy and paste from a school rulebook.
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:27:20
PayPal balance isn't an exchange traded commodity, though.
Even insofar as deciding which transactions are "between people", how much of that Bitcoin do you think is actually used for purchasing goods or services?

Bitpay offers instant payment at market value.

Another thing worth putting into perspective is that $100 movements now are equivalent to $15 movements when we were back at $200.
