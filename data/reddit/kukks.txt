Compared to acquiring some bitcoins(or fractions) for every person in the country, I'd go with calling it free..

If btc enthusiasts would stop bashing and labelling new honest coins such as aurora or doge as shitcoins and the like, btc would be so much easier to adopt to the newcomers instead of alienating and confusing fiat-only people..

* It's a bitch to plan out well
* You can't take any shortcuts, ever, without being noticed and publicly shamed
* You can't run off with people's currency?

I've actually seen the same behavior on a smaller exchange with a smaller amount of holdings. Everytime any one places a sell order, the user bids 10times the amount by a bit lower and then removes his previous order. Also happens the other way round.
I've seen it on BCH/BTC, BTC/EUR and ETH/EUR at TheRockTrading very occasionally..

Respect the agreement. What's the point of alienating even more people and losing more hashpower? 2x isn't Bcash and you should just be happy with that. 
Besides the size needs to increase eventually whether you like it or not.
