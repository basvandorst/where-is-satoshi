Are you thick? Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. Hence information or analysis of thoughts about cryptocurrencies apply to it.

In store in person purchases, I agree. Although lightning network will change some of this (i.e. it won't help about losing out on price gains)
But see this:

Yeesh. I'm already on it. I'm offering a suggestion that will benefit the whole community. What are you doing apart from being a douche?
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:24:47
Maybe? I thought that would only help temporarily

European countries are mostly social democracies you retard. They have progressive tax systems.

Wow I like this one. Also make it solar powered. Also reclaim the heat energy for more energy production.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:07:05
Also suggesting that it's amoral to suggest helping others is so laughable. Like the poor billionaires need protection from the poor. Really pathetic.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:47:39
I only reared a couple comments to Trump where they gaff the selfish money hoarding fuck-everyone-else attitude that he's into.
The person I replied to reacted really negatively, and called a suggesting to help the community as "virtue signaling" as if helping others or giving back to the community that have you your wealth is a bad thing. So fuck that person.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:04:54
You clearly have no concept of morality.
Although I will happily say that if you think the wealthy should think nothing of those less fortunate, or if you think that the wealthy shouldn't consider helping others, that you and Donald Trump can go be pieces of shit elsewhere.

It's an analogy. You're supposed to extrapolate it. It makes sense. Look I'll do it for you.
Someome earnimg 40,000 a year who is taxed 10% is going to struggle with that tax burden MUCH more than someone earning 40,000,000 a year and taxed 15%. It's pretty fucking obvious daniel.

Australia is in drastically better economic shape than the US, our health and education and poverty levels are MUCH better. We tax people more on high incomes because they are able to contribute more to society.
Should a homeless man be taxed as much as Mark Zuckerberg?
The reason it is not just moral but also LOGICAL is because we are a team. Not just in a cutesy way, but because the more people who are economicslly healthy, the healthier the economy as a whole. Poverty leads to drug use, ailing health, crime etc.
Or if you want to be selfish, if 10% of the labor force is in poverty, that's 10% who aren't buying your ebook or whatever. Trickle down doesn't work. You just end up with lots od dead poor people.
It's in everyone's interests to help out.
That's morality.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:04:10
I mean that sounds correct, but what happens during the consolidation period? Why are more people selling than buying?

@_date: 2017-12-19 02:15:55
I think there's truth here, it's so hard to tell though
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:48:57
It is also acceptable if you create a floating island paradise, with powerful automated defence systems, while paying geniuses to develop the technology necessary
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:29:27
That might be a bit presumptuous, if I was doing that at all, but despicable? You're a joke.
I made a suggestion, that if you made millions off the backs of genius hard working developers, that you should consider helping out those developers as bitcoin is facing an existential threat around it's ability to scale.
It's in everyone's interests. 
You're just a scumbag who finds the mere suggestion that people who are in something together help each other out "despicable".
I hope when you need a hand no one helps you.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:58:27
I made a joke once asking someone to set up a utopian island paradise. It was a joke.
I didn't say anyone has a duty (you jerk) but they certainly have far more ability to help than say, a homeless person. Wtf is wrong with you people.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:57:06
Ahaha- oh now I'm sad
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:48:46
Uh you mean the large companies that do everything they can to avoid paying tax, after benefiting from the transport and information networks, other utilities, hell even the military that gets paid for with taxes?
Oh, and then literally give money so they can influence policy to their benefit, subverting democracy itself?
That's your utopian corportate run paradise? Corporate and wealthy welfare when literally millions starve while working, snd can't afford healthcare or education?
Your corporate dominated country is AWFUL to it's people compared to other developed countries, all while people cry about Zuckerberg having to contribute a little more, percentage wise.
It's honestly like you're stockholm syndromed. You need to go to sweden or something. Youd go back to the US thinking "fuck we're stupid."

@_date: 2017-12-30 15:00:46
Possible, I suppose. I guess what I mean is due to the efforts of incredibly smart people who build technology like this, many of us have made good money. Some of us have become incredibly wealthy, and therefore able to contribute back to the platform in meaningful ways. Very meaningful ways, if you're a bitcoin billionaire.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:48:25
Evidence it's being manipulated? I assume you all mean someone is pumping money in to convince others to pump their money in and then they'll sell hard?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:25:06
It's a prompt. I'm sure they're smart enough to make up their own minds.

Will returns begin to slope off because demand will drop, because I dunno, all those who would buy Bitcoin have already, and others will have moved on to the next big thing?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:39:47
Agreed. I just want enough that I'm not forced to work somewhere I hate.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:09:39
I have no idea what all that means
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:50:51
Bitcoin isn't a business as you say, but there are hundreds of businesses built on it. Decentralisation can still have the benefits of organisations working on it and profiting.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:56:34
Feel free to downvote and fuck off, I'm not telling anyone what to do, I'm suggesting something to help everyone. It's almost sad that a selfish Trump-esque dickhead like you will benefit.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:52:25
Fuck you're dumb. These countries have progressive tax rates which YOU SAID leads to a Venezuela style implosion and class warfare.
I pointed out evidence that you're both wrong and fucking stupid for not realising all these successful countries have progressive tax systems in place and are doing very well thank you very much. 
You literally say with a progressive tax system "people quickly lose the incentive to be more productive" yeah because that's clearly happening in the UNITED STATES which has a progressive tax system.
Just admit you're obviously wrong, and your ideology of selfishness and greed is as fucking stupid as you are.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:54:53

Thanks for the thoughts. Excuse my ignorance, but how does merchant use of Bitpay or Coinbase cause downward pressure on the price of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-04 02:40:00
This is not constructive. While the confirmation time compares well to bank transfers, it compares very poorly to point of sale purchases. Unless you use a service that works with MasterCard etc.
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:20:16
Imagine a year of purchases
@_date: 2014-05-04 06:34:38
Hmmm ok, I'd just heard of POS for bitcoin taking 10 minutes. I'll take your word for it.
Although, if bitcoin were to be a mainstream payment method, enough for dodgy payers to be around, wouldn't just waiting for unconfirmed be a risk for merchants?
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:31:16
Don't bite my head off, but I see merchant adoption as fundamentally more likely than consumer adoption:
1. Merchants have a good incentive to support bitcoin, as it's a way to attract market share - a differentiation from their competitors
2. Consumers have less of a good incentive - compare the ease of use (including buying bitcoins then spending them at a merchant) to using cash (you have it anyway)
3. People using bitcoin as consumers (not investors), in my experience, are doing so to: a) Support bitcoin - for various reasons, e.g. principles
b) Play with cool technology
Of course, there's other benefits for consumers, but these are edge cases:
a) get around laws b) get around banks c) get around fees
It seems to me that the easier bitcoin is to use (including acquire) the better - otherwise why would a regular person - someone who isn't motivated by principles, technology novelty, shitty banks - bother?
Compare users of Linux vs Mac OS/Windows: Linux is undebatably harder to use, overall. People use it out of principles, for geek fun, and for freedom from controlling vendors (Apple, Microsoft)
Ubuntu gained market traction by streamlining things as much as possible for the user. Ease of use = increased adoption.
Why did torrenting and downloads take off vs buying DVDs? Importantly it was 100% cheaper. But also it was easy and fast and convenient, it took 5 minutes for someone to set it up for you and show you how torrents work.
Edit: This is why I feel [Electrum]( and bitcoin ATMs are so important. Purchasing from merchants needs work to be faster and simpler. Your competition is PayPass. Aim for that.
@_date: 2014-04-10 00:04:09
There's little point doing this unless you let them know why you're doing so, or there's no way for then to know that they can lose business over this decision.
Also can I have some of your six figures? Just to buy an apartment. Thanks.
