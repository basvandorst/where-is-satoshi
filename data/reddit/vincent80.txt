This says it all...

Yeah, move to DEX and go for Nash or Switcheo

Trading issues should be resolved by the exchange customer support.
Also, the point of a true DEX is that you can withdraw your tokens at all times, even when the exchange goes offline.
Switcheo DEX has both great customer support via Telegram and allows tokens to be removed from the smart contract by the user. It only supports Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) though.

Or use a non-custodial exchange!

Yes, great thinking. Let's take that to the extreme and have bitcoin back at $1 for next thirty years

Use DEX that allow you to trade directly from your hardware wallet.
For some reason, despite all the hacking and security breaches, people still seem comfortable sending their tokens and their full identity to any random centralised exchange, sacrificing control of both.
In the meantime, those exchanges boost their numbers with fake volume, charge exorbitant listing fees (negatively affecting the funds of start-up projects), charge high trading and withdrawal fees, can freeze withdrawals at any moment in time at their sole discretion.
My personal preference is to use [Switcheo.Exchange]( for NEP-5 and ERC-20 trading, when volume permits, as it has CEX-like UI/UX, smooth and fast.

Switcheo Exchange over Aphelion any day. And Aphelion requires KYC which is a no-go.
@_date: 2019-01-26 11:15:53
Such Noob thing to say
@_date: 2019-01-26 19:22:35
Not meaning to make an ass out of anyone. Just saying that the rationale is flawed
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:40:35
You shouldn't practice unsafe CEX.
Use DEX instead!

All four of the above are important. From security point of view, we need to move to Decentralised Exchanges, those that can prove that funds remain within the user's control at all times during trading process.
Let's go back to the roots of crypto: decentralisation and disruption of everyday processes

That is not an assumption. It is moonboy fantasy. Weakness will mean longer recovery and lower highs
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:50:38
Stop using centralised exchanges altogether and move to decentralised exchanges such as Switcheo!!
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:45:18
Better yet, don't use centralised exchanges at all. They charge high trading and withdrawal fees and cheat the projects you invest in with exorbitant listing fees.
Go for DEX instead, such as Switcheo!
