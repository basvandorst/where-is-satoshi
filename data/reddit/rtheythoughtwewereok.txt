How can you think the government wont step in and regulate your bitcoin. They can literally just tell companies not to accept it. They can fine you for using it. They can do whatever they want and theres nothing you can do about it. How do you not recognize that. Putting anything more than .01% of your net worth into bitcoin is the risk point to where you might as well just go to the casino

Hey I was just wondering. Seems like you all just think the government is just gonna let you do whatever you want. Having no plan, doesnt count as a plan. Have fun moving to Venezuela just so you can keep your "money" . Sounds like a real high QOL.

Well change the point of the conversation is what I meant. And the value has nothing to do with regulations. It can be worth more than your life but if it's not accepted in (insert whatever country you live in/will move to), or you get penalized for using it, or whatever of the millions of negative things that could happen, what would you do then. Just seems like you haven't thought it through, especially because you keep giving points to questions I didnt ask

Lol. So when drug dealers start utilizing bitcoin, and more than half the country wants bitcoin banned from everyday use...that's far from monopolistic. Get real

Please explain how that changes anything

Buddy, I hope you make millions on your crypto. Just dont think you're in the majority when it comes to acceptance. You'll be very old by the time it is useful, if ever.

Loll, and theres the icing on the "how to sound like a 12 year old" cake. Let me guess, you own .00000000659 btc..

How can you say bitcoin does no harm? So if ISIS used it to buy a nuke that killed your grandma in florida would you be mad if the government stepped in? Maybe you would be, but more than half the country wouldnt mind. I'm all for a new currency but betting your life savings on a hope and a prayer is pretty ridiculous. All these points I've heard are so pigeon holed and delusional that I'm even more convinced against btc now.
