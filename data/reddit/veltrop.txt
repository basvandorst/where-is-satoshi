Yeah their batches are simply **massive**.  Sure there is a couple minute delay for them to collect a bunch of withdrawals for the batch, but really it's negligible and I don't care since it's not costing me anything.  The whole process including the tx has never taken me more than 30 minutes (maybe I'm lucky).

By operating with fractional reserves, the exchange becoming insolvent in a mass sell-off or unpredicted market movement. 
Even if "unlikely", we've seen this sort of thing in crypto and the traditional banking industry plenty of times already.
Though I guess what you suggest would not be as vulnerable as hackable exchange wallets (hot or cold).

As an American living in France, my passport and ID are from different countries and they won't fully verify me.  So I can't use GDAX and I have huge fees and 72 hour holds on all withdraws.  It was extra nice that I only learned about that delay after buying. 
They've never replied to any support ticket. 
So angry. I actually made the account 4 years ago and only recently bought there for the credit card convinience because SEPA was closed in Europe for several days around Christmas, so couldn't transfer quickly enough into Bitstamp, and I didn't want to miss that dip.
Ended up missing a bunch of opportunities in the alt market because of this fiasco.

@_date: 2014-10-06 04:47:11
Correct me if I am wrong, but is it also called a wall because when the price hits it, the sells are triggered, which forces the price back down?  So it's a comparison to trying to pass the current price through a physical wall too.  And the wall isn't broken until all of those coins can be sold at their targeted price, which may not necessarily happen in a single iteration of trading.

On my 3rd try it worked.  But I chose not to complete the purchase.
I gave up and ended up buying something at coinsfortech.com instead which had a better price, lower shipping (its closer to where I live) and they didn't put the duty fee in the price up front.  coinsfortech.com looks a bit scammy though, but it seems people have gotten stuff through them.

If you're gonna try to play the highs and lows (even just major ones, casually, not as a day trader), you must use limit&amp;stop orders to avoid huge fuck ups.

A few days ago (the 11th) I did one transaction for about 300 sat/byte, it went through in 10 hours which is fine for sending between personal wallets into cold storage.
Unfortunately my next transaction that day I miscalculated and did it at 70 sat/byte.  Still hasn't confirmed.  Thankfully it's a replaceable transaction but I'm going to let it sit and see how long it takes to get through.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:39:31
Sorry shouldn't have got snide there. 
To be honest, Bitcoin isn't ready enough for people to use it casually, without taking time to learn the mechanics.  I already spent a lot of time trying to teach you how it's different than what you are used to, and it felt like you were ignoring it.  I'm trying to tell you there is no easy answer, and it's not what you want to hear. It's not the fault of people like me, it's just the state of things. This is normal in innovation and why early adopters of a tech eventually benefit most from it, because they took the effort when it was hard and got a head start over others. 
So to continue...
Be careful with that $10 assumption. Because it's $10 only at this particular moment. If you were to apply that to a transaction at a different time where BTC versus dollar is different, then it could be fucked up and in the queue for an eternity or very overpriced.  Same issue if you do at a different time when the network is more or less congested. But **most importantly** it's based on a specific transaction size in bytes, and there's no way you are going to know the size of your transaction without introspecting it. This last part is completely different than traditional wiring services. 
I myself fucked up a transaction last weekend making an assumption about the size, it's been sitting in the pool for 4 days now. The transaction size just so happened to be 4x of what that "ballpark" is, even though I had sent another transaction earlier that day, *for the same amount of BTC* which happened to be a size just below that ballpark. 
Won't make that mistake again by assuming to low-ball it.  And I'm also unwilling to pay the $20 it would have cost to send it quickly in between my two personal wallets, in the current state of network congestion, which is what would happen by most wallets which will grossly highball by default.

Buying coins has been vastly more profitable than mining investments for a long time.  And amateur mining isn't going to get you anywhere.
You might be able to eek some value out of it if you can get the electricity for free.  Even in that case, for mining, you'd be more optimal with an altcoin than bitcoin.

The transaction fee applied to this transfer is absurdly low.  I am also still waiting since saturday (one day later than him) for a transaction about the same fee.
But I did it on purpose because I am transferring between cold storage wallets, so I don't care how long it takes and would rather save money.
If this guy needed the money within the same day, same hour, or same minute, he should have applied the appropriate fee.

Ethereum has smart contracts which seem to have functionally more use than just transactions or wealth storage. But I don't know any details about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:32:06
In this data processing world, it's based on the actual size of the transaction in terms of data transfer, bytes, and that has nothing really to do with how much "money" you are sending.  It's more about the state of your wallet and its various addresses and how the coins are spread out across those addresses.
So in your case, just leave things at default values and it'll generally be good enough, but you are missing a small opportunity to save.  You can check the fee, and if it's too high for you, wait for another day or gamble by lowering it with a slider if such a feature is available in your wallet. 
One cannot give a generalized ballpark response to this, as the current state of the network at any moment drives the fees. 
Edit: but if you want one, look at the link I sent you, it actually gives you one for the moment you looked at the page, if you scroll down a bit and actually bother to read the text.

Sure I can see how it still *works* there, and can work in general.  But in what ways in your example is it a *redistribution mechanism from rich to poor*?  Particularly if there are low taxes.  And if the rich were investing back into the local infrastructure and businesses, I would think that it wouldn't be so much of a 3rd world country for much longer.

Again, be very careful, that 171,760 assumes a transaction size of 226 bytes.
But for a transaction which is 900 bytes, in the current state of the network that would end up taking several hours to pass it through instead of the several minutes you might have been hoping for.

In a way yes. But as soon as you spend some of your BTC on the white market, or pay some taxes with it, it can be easily traced in the block chain versus your name. So it gets a lot more complicated to hide your BTC assets and how you got them. It'd be a wet dream for the IRS to be able to trigger audits more reliably and automatically.

Then a few years later, there was a [huge snowstorm]( while I was living in Yamanashi.  There were cars buried for 3 days, with people in them who were posting to social media, while the governor didn't call in the army's help.  I was stuck in Tokyo for business and not able to return to my very pregnant wife for 4 days.

Next time you wanna catch it going down, set a few limit orders on the way down.

@_date: 2017-11-14 19:18:07
You can take a look at this to see what various fees per byte look like versus how much time it's taking them to get processed:  Look at how many bytes your transaction is, and do a quick calculation targeting the lowest cost that meets your timing needs.
That's a bit hardcore mode, there might be more user friendly tools out there that can tell you directly. And depending on what wallet you use will affect how easy it is to see the transaction size before sending it, and what units you can use to set a manual fee. 
In the end I don't trust any app that tries to abstract stuff to "low, med, or high", costs or "fast, slow" speeds with what it thinks is a clever calculation, since that'll generally be based on assumptions of a sole developer's opinion at a particular time and likely isn't relevant for me or for the current state of the network at any given moment. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:41:59


Nah, according to the introduction at  its main goal is about non-dependence on centralized banking and proof of trust of a transaction in such a system.
The only time "cost" is mentioned is about the cost of being a victim to fraud.
Edit: the only time "fast" is mentioned is about penalizing people hijacking the network if they can do calculations too fast compared to the rest, so the difficulty needs to grow to slow them down so they can't become the majority hash power versus the honest nodes.
"transfer money globally" you got that part right at least.

You can't compare Bitcoin confirmation time with MasterCard reversal time. The reversal isn't retroactive of the transaction itself. It's a *refund* in an additional transaction. 
Not sure how to draw a better comparison though. The escrow is close but not really.

Does that mean we're winning?
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:05:50
Aaand we are back at all time highs one month later, above 5k.

So much anti crypto fud on that Twitter thread. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:13:41


I would say the same about this entire thread.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:25:44
I don't consider the recent turmoil a setback at all. It's a vetting. A successful vetting.
And that all happening now rather than later is even better, less potential blowback if the venting were to have failed now than in a potential future with massive market cap.  
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:06:07
Heh, "Le Bitcoin"
And this government web page doesn't just mention acceptance, it even speaks praise of Bitcoin too!
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:52:03
Iirc it was about $10 then. (was around my first buy-in)
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:50:44
Not everyone can mine, not even close. And the other choice is to buy from an exchange so... The comic totally doesn't work. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:40:58
What do you mean by Calimero complex?  Not sure how it applies, if you are talking about that chicken with the eggshell on his head. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:18:08
Tip: don't pay so much mind to the votes.

"Copy of bitcoin_final_final_copy(1)(1)reallyfinal" is so fucking hilarious even the second time today. Can't wait to see it again. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:01:12
Dude, bravo, haven't actually laughed out loud at a meme in a really long time. And throwing in the 2x -&gt; XP -&gt; Vista too, so hilarious. 
I hope that filename becomes a thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:50:14
I was surprised, I expected it to be a pro-btc circlejerk.  Guess I've been living in a bubble. (oops no pun intended) Though most people I know IRL are quick to call btc a bubble come to think of it. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:38:13
I thought so too. But it actually changed somewhat recently and now they do indeed.  
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:30:52
I considered these phrases as praise:
* Bitcoin is the first decentralized electronic currency.
* It is open source and anyone can check the code.
* You can purchase bitcoins from various currencies.
* It should be treated as carefully as a bank transfer.  (by this, yes they are saying to be cautious, but they are also saying it is on the same level as the current standards of bank transfer!)
They could have just said "bitcoin accepted", but they chose to educate the reader in a way to give them confidence in it, and in a way that promotes their usage of it.
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:56:37
Exactly.  And anyway, these are *refunds* from the user perspective, which isn't comparable to confirmation time.  
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:49:19
Literal much?
Pirated media is as easy and free to get as picking an apple in an orchard. 
Same can't be said about acquiring bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:43:36
It hasn't been that low in 2 days.
@_date: 2017-07-10 11:19:29
C'mon this is already still on the front page.
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:45:32
It's open source, all the way to the firmware.  Thus the most futureproof HW wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:22:45
Do it continuously, starting last week. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 12:49:08
Can't tell if sarcastic.

Wtf is this doing in @_date: 2017-07-30 21:29:45
Are you fucking retarded?
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:31:00
That show should never be compared to reality in any way.
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:01:56
If you do FX trading with a lost opportunity mindset, you'll become mentally ill and also make bad emotional trades.
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:47:48
Some MultiBit HD bugs *are* of the fund-losing nature unfortunately, if you don't have a backup from a good moment.
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:28:34
Hah, oh indeed then.
It's why I don't do day trading or general shorting anymore.  I couldn't accept the mindset to know that just a $1 profit is not a failure, and kept fucking up in the end with emotion and greed.
It's classic advice from traders to be able to learn this mindset, lost opportunity != reality.
@_date: 2013-06-17 20:39:19
Thats a high price for a DeLorean.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:08:17
$600,000 per bitcoin?  I don't get the joke...
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:35:13
But if the panic sellers manage to buy back in lower, and the long term price goes even higher than when they bought in the first time, it's more profitable than if they had held the whole time.
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:30:58
Now for me the site is up and the API is down.
Weird that there still seems to be a decent volume of trades being shown on bitcoinity.
It's last April all over again.  Except at that time I was on the ill-fated bitcoin-24...
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:21:18
Wish I kept buying while I was spending!
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:36:07
BTC is backed by contraband.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:23:36
Someday, all the bitcoin will have been mined. It will become precious at that time (or not)
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:22:59
I lost 0.06 attempting to do day trading at the beginning of the recent roller coaster and regained my sanity and went back to hodl.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:14:42
You should stay away from all this stuff until you get some more "practice" on the internet...
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:12:15
It's happening again.  This is really starting to piss me off.
@_date: 2013-06-10 19:14:37
This is PayPal protecting their business, not a government agenda.
@_date: 2013-08-29 04:20:17
What's your point?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:30:28
It's 11am Japan time. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:11:03
No one can give you this answer accurately.  You have to wait and see like the rest of us.

It appears that robbed him elsewhere in this post.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:21:12
Match a key phrase verbatim from the bitcoin scientific paper with a patent related to cryptology. Hunt down the 3 patent authors, suspicious answers from them and consistencies with bitcoin works. Coincidences exist of timing of patent filing and bitcoin domain registration. 
Inconclusive and intriguing and convincing. 
Worth reading.  But perhaps the bitcoin creator(s) merely read that original patent. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:55:51
The vertical axis on that graph is deceptively scaled.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:40:52
Agreed.  I also like when it goes cheaper so I can pretend to be a day trader.  Tonights swings will return a good gain when I buy back in.
@_date: 2013-05-14 01:27:32
but not the bitcoin options i believe.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:00:54
After talking to my family on thanksgiving some of them are buying in.  They had known about it for about a year.
But of course when we tried to make a deposit we hit a wall.  Their online banking software automatically fills in the beneficiary country as the same as the bank country.  But the exchange I use and recommended (Bitstamp) has the bank in Slovenia and the beneficiary in the UK.

Goodbye, crappy foreign exchange booth and international ATM bank fees!

You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin.

Every stakeholder, no.  Think of guys like Son Masayoshi, who have lost more  money than anyone else in history.  80 billion down to 4, and now back up to 8 or so.
@_date: 2013-06-10 19:15:09
Any proof?  Corroboration?
@_date: 2013-06-08 11:32:34
Except that you can buy it with bitcoin, which is needed for the phone to be anonymous.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:26:02
I happened to buy a few sometime last year just for fun, and had a sudden urge to check the blockchain.info site on a whim last week without having heard any of the news (I check about monthly).  
What a fun shock that was.  Transfered it all into btc24.  And now it might be gone.  But I'm totally with on on only investing what I'm willing to lose.  No worries here.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:30:47
I had asked support and the chatroom a question about SEPA and never got an answer, perhaps you will entertain me?  Did you put your personal address or your bank's address in the SEPA form?
@_date: 2013-10-05 18:18:31
I do quite often.
