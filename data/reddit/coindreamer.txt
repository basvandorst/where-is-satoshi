Thank you!

I hope zero if the exchange is one that isn't going bust anytime.  The only reason to do this is to leave the security management to the exchange and you just wait to cash out in a few yrs to buy that yacht.

OK, assuming I go to a store, what app do I need them to install on their Android gadget so I can send payment in BTC ?  I suppose this is the Monday stupid question from me. I should know this....
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:41:44
Go to armory website and they have all the details you need there, well written.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:17:49
yes, but what is the vested interest ?  The proceeds of 'crime' are not put into the treasury are they?  Is that how the US operates?  
So what I meant was simply, the bitcoins are gone and not relevant to running the gov'ment.

Hi btcmille: Are you in UK by any chance?
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:25:05
MtGox are raking in a fortune from transactions, how much can you eat? I doubt very much they need to skim more. 
I withdrew in a couple of minutes no problems at all. Wife was impressed too.

Why don't you just sell a coin and double your mining ?
Or sell 5 coins and, to quote someone here: "to the moon!"

He just wants the bitcoin millionaires to pay their deposits for flights and finance his game doesn't he?
Good PR for Virgin and BTC though :-)

I too have deliberated long and hard over the question: Is this the right time to buy or sell?
The answer is 'Yes', always.  Unless it is time to hold.
Seriously, if it helps you think (because you have to get the answer yourself): Do you have a better use for the funds than bitcoin ?

For those with Chinese experience they will realise this means "to the mooncake !!".  Tastes bloody awful though.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:51:32
Yes, they can both rise up there is room for this.  The difference in mining hardware needs will ensure an army of mini-miners will rise up and that should drive LTC too.

Please not back to the moon.  I was watching it in the rearview mirror already ;-)

I mentioned this to a guy at Philips:
Interesting idea, but not quite novel. Philips Hue incorporates the IFTTT API (If This Then That), which allows you to create so-called recipes. E.g. you can connect the bulbs to a weather service and light your bulbs when clouds come in, or turn on your lights 15 minutes before sunset. Or connect to Facebook and flash your bulbs whenever a new message comes in (sounds annoying). Or indeed your bulbs glow green once your favorite stock jumps above a certain threshold.
So there is more to come, the limit is your imagination I guess.

They still haven't quite got it when they compare BTC with some of the earlier dodgier iterations.  Almost there.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:32:02
Ouch. Thanks for that education, interesting.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:08:44
pse explain
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:52:43
Thanks, looks like Coinbase only for US citizens in USD and the others leave the merchant holding BTC for exchange at the merchants leisure.

Nice mcsnugs.

Nicked from elsewhere:
"I note that than one of the guests represents the Federal Reserve. How ironic. A secretive private entity that is above public scrutiny and feels unencumbered by legislative oversight and produces money out of thin air is complaining about another secretive entity that is outside public scrutiny producing money out of thin air. To further add to the irony, will anyone have the guts to forthrightly ask the representative from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network how many of the "banksters" that crashed the economy have been brought up against charges and prosecuted? How about those at the credit rating agencies that gave high marks to inherently worthless financial instruments that they didn't understand - how many have been prosecuted? Let's be honest, the US Government has failed in being a proper steward of the traditional financial/monetary system. A clear case of the pot calling the kettle black."

oooh...just stumbled across this too:  
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:22:11
I thought bitcoin fans wanted to see the back of banks.  Banning them from getting their grubby paws in the pie is just what I want to see.  It is exceptionally good news for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:46:19
So he cared a lot about Bitcoin if it was possible to care less. Why are you telling us he set up an account? I don't get it....sorry.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:16:27
If you look at the volumes traded/handled around the world, the US appears to be less relevant as far as Bitcoin is concerned.  That said, why would the US hearing be related to the recent price moves ?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:32:42
what was the quote pse?
[I heard mention of Mrs Einstein and the damn connection dropped.]

The exchange doesn't buy the coins from you when you want to cash out. To get the cash, they sell the coins for you.
If you hold one coin on the exchange books and decide you want your $600 or whatever it is.  The exchange matches your sell with a buyer.  Gives you the money after they take any commission.  There is also the trading range between buy and sell price where they make their money. They to not have to hold vast amounts in reserve to cover your sale. They also do not have to care how much the coins cost, it makes no difference to them.
If you deposit cash with the intention of buying coins, then they hold that money until you make the decision.  That can be refunded easily.

what was that stuff about Dillinger?  Filibustering ?
