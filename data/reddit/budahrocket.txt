this is what I did, and then take it a step further, go to bitaddress.org while offline on a computer you trust, input the number of paper wallets you would like and print out two copies of them. Put one copy in a safety deposit/safe and the other in a secure location at home. Then you can send BTC from your blockchain account to one of these wallets and they are cold/paper wallets. You can even input the public key as a "watch only" so you can safely see and verify the funds are there on your blockchain account.

awesome, thank you
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:21:24
I would say that's a good thing
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:04:33
alright thank you, I know it was a little ambiguous. T he last thing I'm unsure of is whether or not I should use the BIP38 encryption when creating my paper wallets.

thanks I'll definitely split it up, do you have any input on the use of coinbase -&gt; paper wallet on bitaddress.org? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:09:21
thanks, I'll keep it under 5BTC per paper wallet, and yeah I read through that earlier, that would be devastating to say the least.
edit: goood, dillpicklechips already answered my question

haha yes! The guy who asked if we accept magic internet money, if only we had been more curious. Thanks for the support!

alright awesome, sounds like I won't use them. And then once I send coins to one of the paper wallets, I will be able to verify the transaction and amount in the wallet on bitchain.info without compromising security?

How big of a concern would you say using 20lb paper and an inkjet printer is for paper wallets? If stored correctly barring an intense fire I feel it should easily last a lifetime even without the lamination. I get using archival ink if you're going for the never ever possible to lose anything 007 BIP encrypted on a dedicated linux drive, but before that point I think you're more in danger of a physical theft
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:35:03
awesome, I'll proabably use the lamination idea and definitely take out the artwork. When spending from the paper wallets how do you deal with change?

please do not let this sub turn into this
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:56:37
thanks for the clarification, so as long as I'm sending to the public address it's fine to make multiple receiving transactions?
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:51:53
Yes, now unless someone physically steals one of my backup copies, they are inaccessible online. The public key doesn't matter if it's exposed to the internet because you can only send BTC to the wallet with the public, in order to spend it you need the private key. The private key, although generated through bitaddress, has been generated randomly without connection to the internet and will not be stored in any way on the internet as long as you print it out and then delete the file. I was a little confused about keys at first as well, and my understanding is that be it bitaddress or your own hex die (overkill IMO) will randomly pick each character in the key and that the chance of that same wallet being randomly generated twice in the existence of Earth is so small that it's for all intents and purposes impossible.

Sweet! Just integrated it into my store and working on setting it up on another store my dad and I run. What percentage of sales for the day was that if you don't mind me asking? I would love to see it actually bring in a decent volume of sales but honestly I would be surprised if it did at this point.
