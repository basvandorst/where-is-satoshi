Cost to produce does not equal intrinsic value. The dollar costs something to produce, but the intrinsic value it provides is different than that

Ya it's absolutely not, that's the point of the thread. Then the guy above me pointed out, for seemingly no reason, that water has intrinsic value. While true, it adds absolutely zero to the discussion. 
Fiat currency does not have intrinsic value. Commodity currency does. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:49:25
Yeah but no one uses it as a currency. Not sure what your point is 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:43:14
It really doesn't. If someone had said "anything with intrinsic value is a currency" then yeah you would have been helping
Instead you stated an incredibly obvious fact that EVERYONE knows and doesn't help argue for or against a point. Water having intrinsic value doesn't change that gold doesnt

I didn't say "if you had said" 
I'm not jumping to conclusions. I know exactly what you said, and while it was correct, it was completely useless to the thread. You're furthering this by misreading what I type

It's 20 for the highest tax bracket

He was actually one of the first people to predict and respond to warning signs of the housing bubble, though he didn't imagine the extent of the disaster.

Berkshire A return over the past 5 years - ~75%
Berkshire B return over the past 5 years - ~72%
Don't get wrong, this post is ridiculous because comparing the returns of two completely different asset classes is pointless (Berkshire isn't trying to get those ridiculous returns, they don't take on anything high risk enough to warrant it), but the A vs B return are pretty similar.

There's like a Craigslist section on Bloomberg as well. Also job openings

Bitcoin has relatively high liquidity, it has high volatility though if that's what you meant? 
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:17:06
Cool, I didn't realize that bitcoin could be lost but that makes sense, thank you. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:21:35
Could you explain what you mean by deflationary asset? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:58:51
In your opinion, what income should be taxed then? 
Should we not have taxes at all? 
And by the way, you can actually claim realized losses on bitcoin since its classified as intangible property - this means you can file a capital loss and claim write it of on your taxes, so the government actually does "give you back" some of what you lost.

That's exactly what I'm saying... You can't predict it, so you can't apply that quote because no one has any idea if now is a good time to buy.
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:57:30
I mean sure, but that's not what we're talking about... The quote is saying that now is the best time to buy. I'm saying that's not applicable. 
If your investing philosophy is "well it has just a good of chance to go up as it does down," then by all means go for it, though it doesn't differentiate anything between investments. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:02:03
That has almost nothing to do with what I'm saying. The quote implies that all stocks will always appreciate in value, which just isn't true.
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:07:18
Right but if that's what you're looking for then you just invest in an S&amp;P index. Again, it doesn't apply to individual stocks/currencies. Bitcoin in no way matches the S&amp;P index.
It's a good quote if you're young, just getting into the market, and are just looking for long term gains. It not good advice for something as volatile and unsure as bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:50:11
Not  necessarily a great quote to apply to cryptocurrency. What if this is the all time high?
I'm not saying that's likely, or even necessarily my view, but it would be like if you attributed that quote to purchasing a stock. What if the company tanks?
@_date: 2017-05-02 21:59:00


How does that not make it seem like investing now is a smart move? 


And you're assuming that investing in bitcoin IS the right thing. I'm saying you have no idea if it is or not. 


I'm not, because I know it's not relevant to investing. My point is that you could throw that quote around about any equity/commodity that appreciated in value, it's not specific in the slightest 
It's a cool proverb, but it's not relevant to investing in the slightest.
