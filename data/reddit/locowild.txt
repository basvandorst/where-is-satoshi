I need to dox myself with a government ID? why? Everyone who want's to upload stolen content or without the consent of the person shown will just use fake IDs or whatever and I have to dox myself even if I want to stay anonymous and only upload content without face for example....

hashpower does not represent users! hence your argument is moot.

not true!
as long as there is a significant amount of users on the minority chain, they will either wait a bit longer for there transactions to confirm (a few hours is still lightning fast compared to weeks or months with KK or paypal) or just change the PoW.
stop spreading bullshit.

you don't understand that things are not as simple as you claim!
as I explained elsewhere:










@_date: 2016-10-16 11:33:46
I didn't say it would go smoothly. a contentios hardfork is pretty much the unhealthiest thing possible. of course it will be ugly. that doesn't mean the minority chain will die!
if the miners switch but the users stay, the forked chain will lose it`s value and create an incentive for the miners to switch back! 
things are not as simple as the parent poster wants you to believe!

you quoted a random and meaningless part of what I said.
if you can't understand a simple sentence like that:


I can only surrender to your cognitive limitations.
If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.

only very dumb or utterly uninformed users will switch to a chain without skilled developers and into glorious demise...
@_date: 2016-10-17 08:41:47
hence the incentive to switch _back_ 
am I speaking chinese, or what?
