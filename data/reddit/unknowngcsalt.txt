I'm pretty sure the only one with zero comprehension of science here is you.

This is not true. Human cells may function with a degree of  separation, but the vast majority of them cannot survive for long (or reproduce) outside of the context of their greater whole. There are no wild colonies of human muscular cells running around. They are not individuals. In fact, it is their specialization that tends to make them so interdependent. They are not genuine individuals any more than the component atoms of the chair you're sitting on are (less in fact).
Of course even if they were individuals, that still wouldn't make your analogy not retarded. Cells and organs don't avoid disagreement out of some hippie utopian ideal that they subscribe to. They avoid disagreement because they don't have brains or personalities to have the capacity to disagree or understand disagreement with. And even if they did, they are simply sub-components of the same individual and thus would have nothing to disagree about. There is zero comparison to be made to groups of humans, each of whom has wildly different dreams, desires, personalities, and preferences. That's why they're forced to negotiate for resources instead of just giving them away according to their automated functioning like cells and organs.
I hope you are trolling or you are very stupid.

Your analogy is terrible. The individual organs of a human body aren't individuals, aren't even sentient, and don't have competing motivations/interests like people. If that's your best argument against money, then you need to go back to the rhetorical drawing board and educate yourself for a few years before trying again.
