With spectre and meltdown being disclosed just this week, can we even be sure that we can trust our hardware?
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:39:28


I don't agree with this. I think people pirate because it is convenient, not because it is free. Steam made buying games convenient. Spotify made buying music convenient. Netflix made buying movies convenient. Most of the people I know subscribe to one or more of these services (and maybe even I do too - even though you have me pinned as a pirate). 
Some people pirate so much shit that they would never be able to afford it in the first place, if they had to buy a physical copy of the album on CD or a movie on a DVD/Bluray. So if they had to do it physically and legally, they would have to settle for less content. Digital distribution platforms like Steam, Spotify and Netflix have been changing this, so that now for the first time we can do it digitally and legally, and because it is cheaper, we still get as much content as we can consume, within our budget. And more and more people are subscribing. 


You are allowed to sell it any way you like, but the fact is simply that more and more people have been choosing to subscribe to emerging distribution platforms like Steam, Spotify and Netflix - and as a consequence, artists are choosing to distribute their stuff on these platforms. I presume because it generates more money for them. 
**Now on to Bittorrent:**
A distributed distribution platform based on Bittorrent is simply the next step. It will completely outmatch Steam, Spotify and Netflix, because it eliminates the middle man. Steam, Spotify or Netflix will no longer take their cut, because the artist can use Bittorrent directly. The only cut the artist has to live with is insignificant fees for bandwidth paid to the seeders by the leechers. 


I am not claiming that OPs program is a way to defeat piracy by making piracy impossible or difficult. I am claiming that as better, easier and cheaper distribution platforms emerge, more and more people seem to choose that over piracy.
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:58:16
Spell out the difference if you would?
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:06:21
If all those seeders who currently provide fast seeding to you decide they are no longer going to do that, except for a few cents, then you may have to.
Or better:
If this is extended a bit, then the movie and music distribution industry might finally pull their finger out and start distributing content like albums or the newest game of thrones through Bittorrent for a fee. I think it has massive potential. Something like Netflix need no longer exist, if the authors of the content can distribute directly through something like this.

However this is just a front-end as far as I can tell. It doesn't do much more than Imgur does as far as I can tell. The issues we are trying to get answers to are more technical, like how does the network prove redundancy or award tokens for transfers. I tried to explain some questions I had [here](

Even when you're competent, mistakes or oversights might slip in when doing it from scratch. So going with something that has been extensively tested like the bitcoind client has, seems like a relatively safe option as I view it. 
Of course they should have been aware of this issue, and found a fix before it became urgent like now. But relying on the bitcoind client as a base seems like a good idea to me.

Well that's a bit of a gamble as well, working so hard on something that doesn't pay now, on the hope that it will become big tomorrow. We could continue to do all that, and believe in crypto, but only keep enough money in bitcoin as we need to buy some things with it. We could keep our savings in fiat. But we don't do that because we like our odds on the gamble that bitcoin becomes big.

Thanks for the write-up. 
HTTP seems rather mundane to me though. Like, we do of course need some standardized way of client-server communication if we are to make a world wide web. But it seems to me that the problem HTTP "solves", or what it contributes, is rather simple, so that anyone could have done it. Like, the client needs to request content from the server, so HTTP has invented GET. It also invented HEAD, which is just the same minus the body. And so on. All rather simple, but maybe this wasn't considered simple back then. But I mean you already had the dumb terminal and mainframe, which I imagine would have had similar ways of communicating to each other. 
Like the whole idea behind HTTP can be boiled down to "Machine 1 asks machine 2 for something. And then machine 2 gives it to machine 1". 
I might just fail to see the significance of HTTP. But comparing it to Bitcoin for example, it seems that the invention of a Proof of Work scheme to secure a distributed ledger by use of a blockchain, is a solution to a problem, which needed much more out-of-the-box thinking than the problem HTTP solved. 
Obviously HTTP has had a tremendous impact on the past 20 years of human history. But without it, I would think that something else would have solved the problem just as well. Without Satoshi to invent the blockchain, it is not exactly obvious that someone else would have invented a working, secure, decentralized and programmable currency.

I imagine that for anyone to be able to register a name to an address, all those registrations have to be stored somewhere, so we might have to wait for something like namecoin or keyhotee to be widely used. I don't know what other projects are working on achieving this.

Im not so sure. I think the price will take some hits definitely, but even with some double spending going on by the owners of GHash, Bitcoin is still superior to the alternatives on many fronts. I mean a 51 % attack is quite like a chargeback, which happens all the time in other systems. And I hope we'll be able to patch the protocol to stop this pooling. At which point we're back on track to the moon, hopefully.

But you could say the same thing about fiat banks, could you not? My understanding is that this is in fact the way they work. And the fact of experience is that runs on banks does not happen often, although if they one day did, the banks could not readily pay out the deposits of its customers. And their customers know this.
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:33:58
I went looking through the last 20 blocks found or so. By far the biggest block is [this massive one]( featuring 2320 transactions. 
It has 1.25825563 BTC in fees total. That means that for this particular block about 4.8 % of the income is in the form of fees:
1.25825563/(25 + 1.25825563)*100 = 4.79185
(This is particularly high, most blocks are way below this value).
Now if you get a large following with this manual no fee movement, let's say 50% of transactions include a donation and no fee. (This is hugely conservative. Remember that some wallets like Mycelium don't even allow you to remove the fee). That means you could strip them of 2.4 % of their revenue for this particular block. 
My guess is that the amount of people you can get to employ this scheme might be closer to &lt; 5% though. And the average block contains waaay less fees. Let's say a tenth of this one. So I'm guessing in practice you will be able to rip them of no more than say 2.4/10/10 % = 0.024 % of their revenue on the average block.
Again I'm not saying don't do it as it has symbolic value. But I am saying that ultimately it isn't the answer we're looking for. We have to find a better way to stop pooling that we may employ in addition to this.

We are not trying to throw a wrench in your thing. We want you to succeed. But we haven't been able to get answers to any of these questions. It is not just super3. The reddit accounts belonging to the storj project developers are active in answering questions right up until the point where we ask for anything in depth on a major technical issue. Then the answers just stop.
[Example from user Utropics](
[Example from user storjproject]( (although this is recent, so let's allow him a little more time)
We can not find anything in the Github code answering the technical issues we think there are. Even though we are willing to dig through it ourselves. 
And when they do answer it is typically to the sound of [Contact us directly and we can discuss it privately]( which is horrible because everyone else browsing these forums won't get the answers, and it effectively just functions as a hindrance to further discussion here. 
All together this has made us very scared of the project even though we are cheering for it.

When you're allowed to loan out a fraction of a loan you took off someone else, then what stops two banks from each lending $100 dollars to each other without interest rate and with no deadline of payment? Now they both have $90 available to start lending out to their customers, while allowing 10 % to sit in reserve. The initial loan could be as high as they like, so, infinite money?

If you have access to internet and an electronic device capable of scanning the private key and transferring the funds away, then we are no longer talking about handing over paper wallets analagous to handing over cash. If we have those things available why show up with a paper wallet in the first place? But okay you even agree in your second paragraph that paper wallets are useless in this situation, so why did you bring them up in the first place?
What you still have no answer for, is what bitcoin can do for you in a situation with no internet. I can use cash in the mongolian desert because you hand over something permanently which can be inspected on the spot, and of which you cannot simply have a backup copy. Bitcoin does not work in this context, and so this is an example of something fiat is capable of, and bitcoin isn't. 
Bitcoin does not have a substitute for cash. Whether it needs to is another discussion, but you asked for something fiat can do and bitcoin can't.

Possible maybe, but not something we'll ever see happen. The change is too big. What we might see is an altcoin launched so that its initial distribution of coins is a snapshot of the current address balances in the bitcoin blockchain. I think that is more likely. Then you just have to use the same hashing algorithm when computing public keys from private keys, and people would have the private key to their new coins in the new altcoin.

That does not matter. At least it ONLY matters from a psychological standpoint. 
You should be trying to handle your investments in a way that maximizes your future wealth. Your future wealth is what should REALLY matter to you when investing. Not what money you had in the past. That is irrelevant to the effort of investing the wealth you have access to now, in order to maximize your future wealth.

I fully agree. This was a nice introduction to the possibilities 
@_date: 2014-07-03 09:02:59
First, if one open source pool could be designed so that it can be allowed to get over 50 percent mining power, then there is no reason to launch 10. Miners like big pools because it lowers their variance of income. 
Failing the above, assume that we were to do what you suggest and launch 10 pools. Then you have to target your fee/donation at a set of pools, not just one which could be done with one address I suppose. I think the best way to do that is to write it into the  protocol. That could maybe be done like this:
Each transaction can optionally include a challenge. The transaction can only be included in a block if the challenge is solved by the miner. Then you ask all pools to provide a public key for which they hold the private key. Then say there are a total of 50 active pools, and you want to allow only 20 of them to include your transaction. You then take the public keys of the 20 pools you trust, and with some multisig magic, you encrypt the first input together with a nonce. Now the multisig magic must allow any of the 20 pools to use their private key to decrypt the challenge and discover the nonce you used. Then they disclose the nonce when they include the transaction in a block, so other nodes can verify that the transaction was included in a block mined by a pool that was approved by the guy making the transaction.  
I don't know whether that works.
@_date: 2014-05-03 08:17:34
On that we agree. I think such a service is the way to go. Or take a look at an exciting project called bitshares music, which is an attempt to make artists provide their content for free, by spreading it on torrents or however, and earning money by selling shares instead of copies. That could easily be extended to work with movies or TV series.

@_date: 2014-01-06 01:10:47
I view that as flawed thinking. 
If you have to extract your original investment because you can't handle the thought of having made an investment that you lost money on, then yes you can extract your original investment. But you can only do that once your investment has doubled, and while you wait for the investment to double, you are risking your original investment. And since we've established that you can't handle risking that, you shouldn't have invested anything in the first place. So your investment strategy is flawed.
It is flawed because you have a strong condition to not accept losses on your original investment. This condition cannot be fulfilled by anything less than a sure bet.

@_date: 2014-07-02 20:54:37
An hour on average yes. Sometimes much more. I don't think it is a good solution. In option 2. (if it is at all possible), you would still continually have to edit the protocol itself to remove pools from that list as they near 51%. Ideally we would want some permanent solution that does not require this. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:34:09
Ah okay. Then maybe my wording in the comment you replied to could have been better. Cheers.

That's fine while it's cheap, but when it isn't, it will make people cautious.

By then you may well have racked in a few coins to make it all worth it though.
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:55:13
That would be really nice. If a "Replace fee with donation to p2pool" button turned up in some of the wallet projects, it just might work. We could also just rewrite the protocol so that the fee goes to a p2pool address rather than to the block miner. Would that be possible?

I see what you're saying, and giving the big players like bitpay or exchanges that option may be a good idea. You can't just exclude ghash from your fees though. It can't work on an exclusion basis. You have to include an output to some other pool or pools and that's where it gets a little tough since you will end up also potentially damaging very small pools. 
I have a question that maybe you can answer. Is p2pool or an equivalent distributed enough that we could confidently let it get to over 51%with no concern? Or is there still someone controlling it for example with the ability to shut it down?

In the case of a future divorce or fight or whatever, the DNA test is an option if he really wants to avoid child support, and he suspects the kid isn't his. However, as of now they are together, and I don't see anything good coming from demanding a DNA test. She will feel betrayed, and he will have to take the kid to the doctor and so on. 
I agree that she should not have any of his coins unless it is he who wants to share them with her. She is in no way entitled. 
But a DNA test now is not the right way to attack the problem. He could start asking her if she has been with someone else if he suspects it, to see her reaction. Or, sticking to the problem at hand, his coins, he should sit her down and explain that she is not entitled to them.

While that is true, my point originally was that some people might want to go to Asia or whatever, but can't afford it. If 7btc is enough to go do that for a month then to me it can be seen as life changing.
The point was just that for a  student potentially in debt, living in a dorm, you can fulfill some dreams for 7 BTC that you can't fulfill without it. That's not even talking about third world people, who arguably have less than a western country student, and what 7 BTC would mean for them -even at the current price.

I see a problem with that. The reason we have fees in the first place is to incentivize miners to include our transactions (it also fights spam and so on, but mainly it just gives incentive to actually include the transaction). If it ends up a lot of small pools, and you donate to a single one, then all the other good small pools will have no incentive to include your transactions. Pools will prioritize transactions with fees that go to themselves. Then the alternative is to split your donation to many small pools, but that increases transaction size.

But how much of that represents investments from super wealthy individuals? It could be that a lot of it does. 
Of course there's plenty of room for other wealthy people to dive in. But it's difficult to know how many will and exactly how many has. The 100x jump you're talking about would require 100 times as many as already has (assuming the price goes up linearly). That means it is necessary to know how many already has and how many will in order to predict whether it is true that it will jump by 100x.

No. Now you're putting words in my mouth. 
You laid out that the price could go from $A to $B, corresponding to a factor of increase, X. You claimed this price increase could be met by wealthy people jumping in. 
Then I laid out the variables to account for, when considering whether an X times increase is probable. 
I never said what factor I believe to be probable. It's true that if you're aiming for 100 times increase, then whatever money is already put into bitcoin is dwarfed by what will need to be put into it, and in that case it doesn't make much difference how many wealthy people already put their money into it, since they will only account for an insignificant one percent anyway.

You are right. It doesn't prevent you from sitting behind 10 nodes. BUT it does mean that you can not store the file once and claim 2x or 3x the reward. Because if you try to act as node 1 and node 2 and point them both at the same harddrive, you sitll have to store the encrypted chunk sent to node 1 AND the differently encrypted chunk sent to node 2. Otherwise you can not comply with challenges. 
So this scheme does not prevent you from pointing multiple nodes at a single hard drive. But it does destroy the financial incentive to do so. 
However: In the special case that there is very fierce competition to be the node that gets to store data, (that is, there is way more storage available in the network than is being used), someone might do this just to saturate his hard drive's potential. I'm not sure what happens then. I can't remember whether we discussed that in IRC. Would have to check the logs.

I don't know of a working solution to any of these, although I hatched ideas of a possible solution to the second problem in the freenode channel together with yesterday. We discussed using an escrow system where the escrow is performed by delegates with reputation points similar to the delegates in Bitshares Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS). 
But don't get your pitch fork out yet. It may be too soon. In fact I would be satisfied if they came out and said "We have no clue about solutions to these problems yet. That is why we are holding a crowdsale, to support developers who will figure out the solution to these problems". If they did that, we would know where they were. 
It is the fact that they are not coming out and saying anything either way that is starting to smell bad. 
-edit: I can't quite follow your suggestion to the first problem. I would need a little more detail to understand. Encrypting the data three times and having each node store a copy of the data which is unique because it is encrypted differently would be a way to ensure that someone don't just store it once. But then, if one node goes offline you would not be able to restore redundancy from the other two nodes. So in the end it does not help any.

Mathematics was not discovered. It was invented. For example, you can invent both Euclidean geometry and you can invent Non-euclidean geometry. Now which did you discover and which did you invent? The fact is both were invented, and when you went to investigate the world, you found euclidean geometry did a pretty good job at predicting things in the real world. It is a good model. Then of course Einstein discovered that even Euclidean geometry wouldn't suffice. But that is something that has to do with the realm of physics, not mathematics. That discovery made by Einstein does not invalidate euclidean geometry from a mathematician's standpoint. Just as non-euclidean geometry is perfectly valid from a mathematician's standpoint, even though it is weird and cannot be used to predict things correctly in the real world. 
What about all the theorems in Euclidean geometry? Did we discover or invent those? Well, what we did was invent a set of rules (axioms). Angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees and so on. The theorems and the rest are just logical consequences to that invention.

I'm guessing here, but I think a node reads way to much data from the blockchain for that to be viable. A node uses much bandwidth as it is. And that is just from relaying transactions. If it had to retrieve blocks from the blockchain from the cloud to check the validity of each transaction it is about to relay, that would use way too much bandwidth I think. I don't think it is practical.

Some think proof of stake is an  improvement over proof of work. I much doubt that you could change bitcoin to use proof of stake because it's such a radical change of its foundation. In the face of that change, all the bitcoin miners would stand to lose income, so you would have to fork it and there would not be agreement over which fork to continue on. It's just too messy compared to adopting a proof of stake alt coin, if that's the feature you want.
Edit- 
Another example is that bitcoins source code is written in c++ I think, and it's quite a mess. While some alt coins work on 600 lines of python. If you see this as an advantage, it's one that you cannot just implement into bitcoin.

Hey, sorry I took so long. Just wanted to come back here if you're still interested. 
I think we actually agree, and maybe I just phrased my post badly. 
What you are telling me is that ten $1 games has the same expected return as one $10 game. I agree on this. 
What I initially meant to argue is something along these lines: Imagine you start with $5 and want to have $10. Which means you're going to keep playing until you reach $10 or $0. If the odds are in the favor of the house, your best chance is to make as few bets as possible. That's why I said 


I'm sure you agree on this as well. Sorry for the misunderstanding and the delay. 
edit- well, I started to read your discussion with OP. Of course if you want $10 and are going to stop as soon as you reach $10, you can do some programmatic betting that's better than betting all $5 at once. But I was just trying to argue that if you just want to try your chances, larger and fewer bets have a higher expected return than a larger number of smaller bets.
--edit okay I read most of your discussion with OP and feel like all this confusion comes from vague terms and bad phrasing. Reading that as an outsider, I understand why you and dooglus both became frustrated lol. Allow me to try to be perfectly clear on what I mean once and for all:
**If you bet N units, whether it is one bet or several smaller ones amounting to N units, the expected return is the same. (This is what you proved).**
**Your best bet at coming out ahead of the house is to play for high variance, since the game is rigged in their favor for every bet. That means if you're just shooting for the moon wanting to multiply your money as much as possible, you should attempt to do it with one or consecutive all-ins. This is what I meant with my first post.**

@_date: 2014-05-30 06:32:45
Proof of stake is the idea that you get to vote relative to the amount of stake you have. What this means, is that the more coins (stake) that you have, the more often you can generate new blocks in the blockchain (vote). It's like in a company. In a company, you get to vote on the direction the company is going based on your amount of shares. The more shares, the stronger is your vote. This analogy holds when you consider that what you're voting on in a crypto coin, is what the next block should look like, and in proof of stake, your vote is stronger when you have more coins, because the coins can be seen as shares in the network. The idea is that stakeholders are interested in the network being secure and reliable (otherwise the price tanks), so they are incentivized to vote honestly in what the next block  should be. 
Proof of work is different in that shareholders (people with coins) have no votes when you view bitcoin as a company. It is a separate entity that decides the next block, the miners. The miners can be seen as employees, paid to secure the network (they're paid in shares, the coins released with each block). What decides the voting power of the individual? Their hardware's hashrate. 
The advantage of proof of stake is that you don't have to release anywhere near as many coins (issue new share and dilute the shares of the shareholders) each new block. It also doesn't depend on hardware like proof of work does, so you don't have this huge waste of electricity. 
The advantage of proof of work is that it's tried and true. It also apparently has better handling if forks, because you can only use your hash rate to mine on one chain. In proof of stake you can continue to mine on both, which is a nasty thing.

In the end it seems like people just flock to the biggest and easiest to use pool. 
If we make p2pool or an equivalent easy to use, and after enough of these threads have been made, sometime in the future we may have the largest pool be a distributed pool like p2pool. At that point, new users will just flock to this one, and the problem might fix itself, as we can just safely allow it to slowly become the only one.

You can't have a steady stream of a few satoshis, even if you set no fee. Because that doesn't meet the minimum transaction output accepted by the nodes. So it would be a centralized service where you would wait for them to pay it out to you just like Spotify.

We discussed a solution with lead developer super3 in the freenode chat. You can read it all from the link in the OP edit if you will.

I'm leaning on it being positive. It means a big player is active, and if that is some kind of fund or something, and not just a whale speculating, it could mean huge news around the corner. 
It also means competition for coins is pretty fierce, and all those who lost will have to go out and buy off exchanges instead if they still want bitcoin. Maybe that's why the price went up?

Yes the votes are proportional to coinage. I think votes are generally cast automatically as part of every transaction, so each chain will have its own separate voting going on. So in the solution I proposed above, that is, you bind your delegates to a single chain by social contract, you would have to take manual control of your vote in the case of a fork. Just like you would have to direct your miner to a single chain manually in the case of a fork in bitcoin.
This is all pretty shaky I agree, and perhaps they have a better solution that I'm unaware of. (I hope so)

Last week I felt bad watching game of thrones by getting it through torrents. Then I realized that I don't want HBO Go or anything like that because I feel like torrents really gives me the best product and if I started using HBO Go it would worsen my experience.
So I went looking for a way to donate to HBO. But I found that that is not possible. In fact people have made entire websites because they feel bad for pirating and want to pay: 
Now, if every episode of game if thrones (or another series or movie) had this text at the end of the credits, I might donate every week: 
"if you watched this by pirating it, consider donating to us by sending bitcoin to the following qr code:"
I could give them my money by purchasing HBO Go, but I don't want to do that because I wouldn't be using it, and it sends the message that I'm satisfied with the payment options they offer. I think the future will require content producers to find a way to tab into the lost revenue they get from pirating in a way like this. Steam got it right when they realized that people pirate games mostly because it is an easier and better service, and with a service as streamlined as steam, people didn't mind paying for their games.

25 BTC per 10 minutes is 25x6 per hour. That's 25x6x24 per day, which is 25x6x24x364 per year. Divide that by about 12 million BTC in existence, and that gives 10.92 percent.

No the owner encrypts a piece of data in three different ways, then sends one piece to node 1, one piece to node 2 and one piece to node 3. Node 1, 2 and 3 would not be aware that they are holding the same data encrypted differently. Even if they are aware and they are controlled by the same guy, he cannot just store it once, because the chunks have different fingerprints because they were encrypted differently. Node 2 would not be able to fulfill a challenge posed to node 1, because the challenge is tied to that fingerprint. Makes sense?

I don't think so. If you operate a Bitcoin node you have to continously check the validity of incoming transaction by looking up its inputs on the blockchain. Which basically means you need local access to the blockchain while running the node.

I think that change in mindset has to be triggered by merchants. As it is right now, every merchant decides that their sandwich is worth 5 USD and then they look up the exchange rate everyday to find out what they should charge people in bitcoin. 
That has to be the other way around, so that they decide that the sandwich is worth 10 mBTC, and then look up the relevant USD price everyday (or keep both fixed). 
Until that start happening, people won't think of their bitcoin as a practical currency, as you put it. 
Until that start happening, my purchasing power with the bitcoin I have is proportional to the exchange rate. And that makes the exchange rate very important when trying to use Bitcoin the Currency.
Maybe we are in agreement?

The reason it takes forever to get the blockchain is not that you have to download it and the download is slow.. The reason is that in order to be sure that you're operating an honest node, you have to check the validity of every single transaction as you download the blockchain. There is a risk that the torrent you download, that you assume represent the real blockchain, is not the real blockchain. That it might have an invalid block in it. And it would be bad if everyone suddenly used this malicious torrent and assumed it was legit.
Anyway, that's what I've heard on some time ago. I don't know whether it's a true concern.

I have no prior knowledge of that type of attack. If I understand correctly, in this context, the danger is that a single attacker  poses as several identities, and more than one of these identities are elected. Giving the attacker a disproportionate influence. Is this correct? 
I don't know how they plan to deal with that, but I propose that you require a delegate to prove ownership of some decent amount of coins. And then check that no two delegates reference the same coins. I imagine this to work because it would require the attacker to obtain twice the amount of coins in order to get two identities elected. Or three times for three delegates and so on. 
The whole point of proof of stake is to place the voting power with the bigger stakeholders anyway.

You purposely left out YouTube in that. It seems to me that is the service they seek to replace with this. And there is no shame in starting there. They can expand it if they are successful. The underlying things they are developing will work for other forms of data as well, but in order to successfully compete with established things like YouTube, the interface has to be tailored for video. In order to successfully compete with a music service, the interface would have to be tailored to music. In order to compete with a code sharing service, the interface would have to be tailored for that. It takes time to develop these interfaces, so why not start with one.

A subscription service can't charge anything from a cold stored wallet, even when it has money in it. And if you want to keep it cold stored, you can't really use a subscription service. I don't see how anyway. So I don't think it compares well to just keeping a positive balance on a credit card. 
The alternative is to keep a smaller stash in a hot wallet and use that for subscriptions, but that does not really sound attractive when we start paying larger bills like our rent in bitcoin. 
I agree that the functionality should start to appear in wallets though. We'll see what the use cases will be.

As I understand it there are three ways that money flows:
* When you upload data to nodes you spend coins proportional to the data size and level of redundancy (if the level of redundancy ends up being specifyable by the user, which I think it should be).
* When you retrieve data you spend coins (according to data size?)
* If you have data stored on the network and go offline for some time or just don't want to leave the client running, you spend coins to pay a "watchdog service" to send out challenges to the nodes to ensure that your files are stored correctly and that service notifies you to come back online and generate a new copy if one of the nodes fails the challenges or goes offline. 
-edit there must be something missing here. Some running compensation to the node for storing your data for an extended time is missing.

Precisely, I agree. I had some fun with some calculations:
Taking the log return, a rise from 350 USD to 100000 USD in 10 years constitutes a 56.55 % continuous annual logarithmic rate of return. As computed by
    Log[100000/350]/10*100 == 56.55
You can see that this is right by checking that
    350*E^(0.5655*10) == 100000
Now for comparison, what is the historical logarithmic rate of return for bitcoin to date? Let's pick a date. Say around December 2011 (3 years ago). Then the price hit a local minimum of $2. (It's not very easy to pick a good date and a regression would probably be better). Anyway, then during the past 3 years the continuous logarithmic rate of return has been 172 %:
    Log[350/2]/3*100 == 172.16
Quite high. Or is it? Let's take the price in December 2012 to now (past two years). Then the price was around $13, so we get 168 % rate of return:
    Log[350/12]/2*100 == 168.65
Still quite a lot! 56 % for the next 10 years still looks optimistic. But hey who knows.

There is still value to Bitcoin. For example it allows us to hold digital cash. With fiat currencies, you need a bank to store your money digitally. If you don't trust the bank, your only option is to store metal or paper under your bed, you can't store your money digitally by yourself. 
However as we now do have this option with Bitcoin, maybe the market forces will only allow success to bitcoin banks who are very open about what fraction are real BTC. At least that's my hope.

Most interesting. I had not considered this. 
Maybe something like delegated proof of stake (DPOS), which invictus innovations is currently implementing will have a solution to this. In short, it works by electing a number of delegates, which are the ones that get to mine new blocks. The delegates are elected by the stakeholders, or coin holders, like a democracy. In the case of a fork, you would initially have the same delegates on both chains, and by social contract you could only allow delegates to mine on one chain at a time. If they break that social contract and mine on both, you replace them and elect someone else. I don't know whether that world work. How does peercoin and nxt handle this?

You can't automate it so people don't know. You have to ask them to deposit bitcoin into popcorn time first. Which I don't think will work. But if you make it voluntary, some people might tick a box that says "donate x BTC after every full watch" and then deposit some BTC. Either way I don't believe Hollywood can avoid adapting to something like this much longer.

If this doesn't sound right to you, I'll have to know how much you know already, in order to explain it.
Imagine you space it out over many, many bets. Remember the odds are rigged in favor of the house. In fact, imagine you space your bets out infinitely. Then your expected return is 0. Does this make sense to you? 
If it does, then you'll see that a single bet is better, since with a single bet, you have a positive expected return. After all, if what your betting on is an honest coin flip at odds 1.90 for example, your expected return is 0.95 times your bet.

The current number of active Facebook users is close to 1.3 billion. It has a market cap of 150 billion dollars. That's about 115 dollars per active user. 
If on average, a bitcoin user has more than 115 dollars worth of bitcoin, then bitcoin will overtake Facebook on market cap before it overtakes on user base.
I think 115 is low, especially considering we have some massive whales and other big time investors in bitcoin that bumps up the market cap. So yeah, in going with market cap as well. :-)

You're thinking in absolute values, not in relative values. 
If a merchant is concerned that a transaction takes days to go through, because mycelium has started to allow transactions with no fee or small fee, then they could demand their consumers to include a fee. 
How much would that fee be? A miner would be interested in a high fee in absolute terms, while the merchant is only interested in fee high enough in relative terms, that it goes through quickly. The merchant would set the fee relative to what other people are paying in fees across the network. The merchant would be interested in as low a fee as possible, while the transaction goes through quickly, because as you said, the merchant doesn't gain anything from a high fee, other than a transaction that doesn't get stuck.

I realize that you are just getting started. It is ok that some things are yet to be developed. However, there are core difficulties to this project that we don't see solutions to or even talk of. If you have not already considered these things, then storj looks like little more than a dream to us. We have seen MaidSafe and BitButt and so forth be taken apart on these forums for not being able to answer these questions. Specifically my major concerns are the following two scenarios:
* The safe storage of data on the network requires redundancy. What prevents someone from creating 100 nodes on the network, while in reality it is the same person letting all his nodes [use the same hard drive]( If 2 or more of those nodes are asked to store some user's data, then he stores it just once, but his virtual nodes will all be able to claim that they have it. 
* When a client stores data on the network and later wishes to retrieve it, what happens in the following situation: The client asks the server for the file. The server sends it to him. The client receives it but claims to the network that he did not. Or, the server does not send the file to the client but claims to the network that he did. What happens when there is a dispute? Who does the network trust and how does it award SJCX in this case?
Your marketing is excellent and the content you made (the decks and so on) are excellent. The MetaDisk test nodes look awesome as well in design. It all looks professional except when we dig a little for actual code or protocols. Then it all seems out of balance, because if you haven't considered these things then we have little faith that you are about to launch anything successfully.

But when you say they create money out of thin air, they are notifying the federal reserve that they made x dollars right? By trading IOUs?

@_date: 2014-03-27 09:05:13
That does not work. First because you don't know if the address actually contains bitcoin before you get home and look it up on the blockchain. Second because the guy who gave it to you might have written down the private key and when he gets home he transfers the money away. So no, a paper wallet is not a substitute for fiat cash.

I agree. But then let's agree on the following statement: At the present bitcoin does not have this function, as no bank does this.
And I really doubt that you will see this in the future, like you say, it isn't adviseable. And for it to be useful it would have to be very widespread. So you need not a bank, but a network of banks or governments to agree on a standard of 'difficult to counterfeit notes' before it's feasible. So let's also agree that effectively bitcoin cannot do this. 
And by the way, if you do it like you suggest, you can do it with anything. We can use potates as currency then (like in Latvia).

The federal reserve prints money and lends it out at interest. They are the ones you can't pay back. 
No matter what good investments its lenders make among themselves does not matter - they are merely moving money between each other that ultimately they loaned at some point from the federal reserve. 
When it comes time to pay back the federal reserve loan, there is not enough money to do it because only the federal reserve is allowed to print money, and they are now owed more money than they ever created (because of the interest). 
Sure you can default on your debt, but who are the federal reserve's lenders? It's the treasury / too big to fail financial institutions. It is not you and me. And those cannot be allowed to default.

Well people can be both. I believe in Bitcoin as a superiour technology, and I very much wouldn't mind getting rich quickly. Therefore I also keep an eye on the price. 
But even someone who cares only about getting rich will inform himself on bitcoin in the process, and he might talk to other people about it. That creates awareness. His intention might be to get rich, but in the process he holds Bitcoin and might spend some along the way. What exactly is the problem in all this?

It doesn't have to completely go away. As long as Bitcoin can live alongside fiat, and people know of Bitcoin, it will be the natural choice to use Bitcion in situations like sending money to 80 people all across the globe like OP. 
So Bitcoin will be used for that, and it will be generally accepted by people that if they receive a transfer from the other side of the globe, it will be in Bitcoin. Then, those that want to, can convert it to fiat. 
Either this, or fiat transfers will become faster and cheaper to compete.

I'm kicking myself for not selling a month ago, because I did see the writing on the wall. 
The white paper is what got me onboard initially. Today I feel heartbroken that I made my exit. I feel a little empty. Godspeed bitcoin, and all you fellow bitcoiners.

I'm not saying we don't need investors. I'm saying that in addition to investors, we need people who care about the tech, health of the network, uses it as a store of value, and, as a basis for trade. That is, as you say, currency. 
But wait, what's the definition of currency? Currency is a generally accepted form of money, which is circulated within an economy, used as a medium of exchange for goods and services. Currency is the basis for trade. How the hell is it going to function as a currency if blocks are full? That's exactly what it can no longer function as.
The people who are fearful of this development are the people who fell in love with Bitcoin by reading the whitepaper rather than discovering a price chart in the spring of 2013.

The day either segwit or bigger blocks is agreed upon, that's the day you'll find me celebrating. I don't much care which of the two comes first. 
But until second layer solutions are actually here, I would like a block size increase, so as not to dissuade people from thinking that Bitcoin can function as a basis of trade, while we wait for second layer scaling solutions.

They want control because they feel control is being taken from them. 
Because they feel bitcoin's use cases are being unnecessarily restricted and dictated for them. 
And they are right, one of the two use cases are broken at the moment.

Interesting. Thanks for the debate. 
While I do mostly agree with that, I still think 1 MB is an arbitrary limit.
 I think the network can sustain a slightly larger limit. 
I don't believe there is good reason to not let that limit follow the capabilities of our hardware and our internet bandwidth. Of course the limit should be conservative, so as not to surpass what we can afford in terms of hardware and bandwidth. 
But to maintain the block size limit below what our hardware infrastructure can support, that to me is a complete waste of potential. 
I do believe we can sustain the network while allowing slightly larger than 1 MB blocks. 
As for making sure that miners are being paid, we could probably eliminate the block reward and inflation completely, and the network would still be plenty secure - the hashrate is so huge. Since we are stuck with the block reward for a long while longer, we do not need a fee market to secure the network.

@_date: 2017-03-01 21:47:37
I mostly agree.
 I agree that the digital-gold crowd can keep flogging in without segwit or a block size increase. I agree that an ETF would bring even more investors/speculators without issue. 
However, while we agree that the digital gold use case is not hindered, I think we can afford a block increase without damaging the digital gold use case significantly. 
I don't think it is a good idea to limit bitcoin's use cases to that of digital gold or that it's right to dictate that its use case shall be limited to that of digital gold.
If investors keep flogging in, but the crowd of people who like to use Bitcoin for actual purchases are prevented from growing, then I feel that creates an imbalance over time, where Bitcoin becomes too heavenly based on speculation. This is where it starts to look like a Ponzi scheme to me. 
I realize that these second layer scaling solutions are in the pipeline. Proponents of bigger blocks are generally not writing off second layer scaling solutions. But they are too far off and we need something in the meantime. 
I believe we can afford a block size increase in the meantime, to avoid bitcoin's use cases to go out of balance. 
I believe this can be achieved without damaging the digital gold use case. So why prevent it's use as a payment network when we can have both as we have had up until now? 
That's not saying Bitcoin should scale infinitely on chain. But second layer solutions are too far off and bitcoin is already being restricted to only function as digital gold. 
No wonder there is a crowd that feels Bitcoin can no longer serve their needs. Especially since there is a belief that restricting bitcoin to only one of two use cases is unnecessary in the short term. That's why that crowd decides to be so vocal.
There may be a need for a block size limit, but 1 MB is not it. That is arbitrary and too small. It is too small because the second layer solutions are so far off, blood is already in the streets and the network can afford a larger blocksize. 
Personally, I want a block size increase now. I also want segwit and second layer solutions just as much. But second layer solutions will take time (years). It's the current stagnation that's troubling to me.

I apologize if I'm preaching to the choir here. I don't know in which sub to post in order for the miners to read my words. 
However, since we are split into two subs that are hostile against each other, that would seem to indicate that we are not all on the same page (and we are not all miners).
And since this is a forum, I suppose the way to get closer to each other is to express our views and debate.

Dude, all you're talking about in your whole post is the price going up and down.
If price is what you care about, then yes, today is great!
If the tech is what you care about, then bitcoin is now failing to provide a core function that it was always able to provide before. 
To you, price seems to be all that matters. It's "an investment". If the guys who care to use Bitcoin for actual transactions decide to leave, and guys like you are all that's left, then bitcoin has become a Ponzi scheme. 
It's fine if you only care about the price. But you must at the very least be able to comprehend that to some other players, the tech and the health of the network and community, matters more.

I would recommend Electrum. 
What you get is 12 English words, and if you can remember those, then you can spend your bitcoins.
(The words work as a _seed_ for generating bitcoin private keys, public keys and addresses.)
So you write those 12 words down and hide them somewhere.
In addition, I've memorized mine (it is not difficult, honestly). 
If I were to invest a significant amount of money in Bitcoin, then I would worry about how my familiy would get access to my bitcoins if I suffered an accident. I haven't figured that out.

Big blockers were not only talking about a doubled blocksize. They're talking 20 MB blocks. 
In fact I think core has agreed to a doubled blocksize, no?
I read the whitepaper including satoshis concerns and predictions about scaling. 
At any rate, the most basic concern is that an increased blocksize simply means that miners and nodes need to use more bandwidth to transmit transactions and blocks, and some miners and nodes will disappear because of that.
One thing I read somewhere which I don't know whether it is true or not, is that the great firewall of China limits the bandwidth going in and out of China, so that an increased blocksize could separate the Chinese miners from all other miners.

Back when I was interested in alt coins, I was trying to decide between ether and bitshares. 
They were about the same market cap then. 
I made up my mind that bitshares was the more promising of the two, and look what happened to that. 
They had such good ideas and they were going to revolutionize the crypto space all over again, but it was just too complex and over time, it turned out to be poorly executed. 
I still never truly understood the value of ethereum. What's wrong with Counterparty?

If Bitcoin is a company and it's employees are the miners, then the company pays it's employess a paycheck every 10 minutes. (Normal companies do it once a month, but Bitcoin is anything but normal). 
"The halving" halves the budget set aside for paying employees. Bitcoin has paid the miners 25 BTC every 10 minutes for a while now, but at the halving, this becomes only 12.5 BTC, that its employees have to share.
It means that as a miner, your paycheck gets cut in half.
So what will happen? Some miners will probably retire their hardware. What will happen to the stock value of the company (the BTC exchange rate)? No one knows, but there is speculation that it will go up, because the company has found a way to cut its spending in half, which is usually pretty great for a company.
We don't need so many employees (miners) anyway, truth be told.
But if this results in more centralized mining because the small guys close shop, then that may be nasty. I don't fucking know but I enjoy the ride! :D

I was convinced around June 2013. I took my sweet time though, and ended up panic buying during the November bubble. So that has sucked for the past 2 years.
This week is the first time in 2 years that I have not lost money on my bitcoin investment.

And what a job it has done leading that vanguard. It has withstood all attacks against it, to the point that the biggest threat is now indecision over its very definition and purpose, from within its own community.
If we are the ones who ultimately manage to bring bitcoin to a bitter end -- against our own wishes -- it will truly be ironic. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:25:57
If a wallet is based on a seed, like electrum, then I don't see why you couldn't have a desktop client as well as mobile clients, then type in the same seed in all clients. 
The addresses it generates including change addresses are deterministic. 
Effectively, that's a synchronized wallet. It uses the blockchain as the synchronizing third party. 
As for security, encrypt with a password. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:07:59
Yeah. The attacks are numerous and [creative](
@_date: 2017-01-08 13:39:29
We expect volatility (for now, it will go away when we reach mass adoption).
We like it anyway. 
We expect Bitcoin to become worth a lot in the long run, so in the meantime, it is both a currency (albeit a volatile one) and a speculative investment to us.

It's beautiful in its own way.

I've been following the news for three years and that's great, but this week is crazy and coming together to celebrate it with memes is fun. Let us have our fun, we've been waiting three years. 
You can have your news back when this roller coaster rolls into the station. 
If we can implement a filter, great, but don't go pushing us out of the sub. We're the same people who've been discussing news with you before the price went crazy. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 09:04:07
If raising the blocksize leads to increased centralization, then bitcoin will no longer be digital cash with no trusted third party. 
Raising the blocksize will allow it to scale better as a payment network, but small blockers feel that this function is better offloaded to off chain transactions such as the lightning network. People buying coffee will be just fine using the lightning network (maybe even happier, because it's faster), while people who truly need to put a transaction on the main chain can still do so, albeit at a slightly higher fee. 
Personally I strongly hope segwit gets activated. Because we need to do something and this political war is driving me nuts. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 22:56:14
Because despite the politics, the volatility, the scaling issues, the difficulty of securing your bitcoins and other adversity, if I just pick up the white paper and read it again, I still get the same feeling of "my god, what a brilliant and unique invention". 
And I don't like nor trust the banks, insurance companies, unions or any other thing like that. Bitcoin somehow appears simpler to me than all the crap I have to read, understand and sign in order to do business with the rest of the world. 
I like simplicity and I don't like dealing with anything that comes out of these institutions. My bank sends me mail. Bitcoin does not. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 16:21:04
Did you read Satoshi's white paper? 
He literally predicts that it will end up as big data centres doing all the mining.

While this is not yet as wild as Nov 2013, this is a significant rally. This sub suddenly feels like an echo chamber and everyone is again chanting "$10000 is undervalued!". 
I mean come on. It has been mostly dormant for three years. Now it's going crazy for two weeks and you all claim it's natural growth. Now all of a sudden everybody who don't get bitcoins are idiots while we get to "collect our bitcoins for cheap at $1000".
I hope we ride the wave all the way to $3000 or $4000, but to me it does feel like a small bubble already.

If I look at the USD to BTC exchange rate, I'm in the red. 
But I live in a European country with a currency pegged to the euro, which has tanked because of Greece and so on.

Granted, the best trade would have been to simply exchange for USD.

I'm the same. This little bull run is great! But there is still a long way to break-even. I'm hodling though because either I lose 100 % on this investment or it multiplies by a BIG factor in the end. If there is a 50/50 probability of both, then it's a great game to play. :)

@_date: 2016-07-02 22:48:17
If all miners do this then bitcoin becomes unusable. If it is unusable then it isn't worth anything, so the price tanks. Then the miners won't earn anything from mining. So it isn't in their interest at the end of the day. 
However maybe a single miner decides that he can get away with it because every other miner will include transactions. This does occur. There are some empty blocks mined. 
If too many do this then we enter a tragedy of the commons kind of situation. 
There is a little incentive to include transactions though; they include fees.
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:47:41
It sounds like you know more than me. I just remember reading it back when I was discovering bitcoin through the white paper
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:27:50

@_date: 2015-02-17 18:32:26
Yes old addresses that were once in use but now have balances of zero can be disregarded in some sense. You don't need to keep that information in your local version of the blockchain in order to validate all incoming transactions without issue. 
This is mentioned in one of the last pages in the white paper as satoshi was aware that it could become an issue.
@_date: 2016-07-08 17:28:33
We have daily swings from 680 to 615 anyway. I get what you're saying though. I guess that we will see a gradual increase to 900 within the month, as the effect of the halvening takes hold and segwit comes online. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:12:33

Now ethereum is the coin debating hard forks, and bitcoin has a lot going for it: price rise, segwit, csv, halving...

Ok, and this functionality is gone with 1.9 because it now has two methods of using a seed - what it used to do and what is described by BIP32?
@_date: 2013-11-04 09:05:03
That makes sense. Then I suppose it's a guess as to when the cards come tumbling down. Or maybe the US agrees to stop pumping out money like that.
@_date: 2013-11-04 08:50:01
That's correct. The change address is introduced to allow bitcoins to be spliced without keeping track of every 1 Satoshi which is 0.00000001 BTC.
If we want to get technical it is not enough to make the inputs unequal to the outputs and not tell in the transaction what you wish the fee to be. That would be rejected as an invalid transaction. You have to tell explicitly what you want the fee to be, and that has to equal the difference in inputs and outputs.
At least that's my understanding.
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:15:57
I know, but I want to make sure that the numbers are right with the difficulty and everything else the way it is right now.

Well if it turns out it has the potential to compete with VISA on some scale, then it would have to compete with 7000 transactions per second.

I had to give it three tries before they accepted my verification papers. It took 2 days for each attempt to either get denied or verified.
They are strict, but they follow the requirements they have on the site, so you just have to be sure to follow those.

Which I know Electrum and maybe other clients already does. Still this is huge that such a vulnerability shows up in what i presume people thought was a sound encryption algorithm. 
Is it possible for you to explain to us what a back door like this looks like? Since the whole thing is open source, how do you hide it? By knowing something mathy about the way it works that you choose not to share, so that the math the crypto is based on is flawed basically, and you hope people don't realize that. Or how?
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:30:51

Some wallet files (Electrum fx) don't encrypt the public keys in it, only the private keys. So if OP send you his wallet you would be able to see which public keys it contained, and by guessing the password, gain access to the private key. Or am I wrong about something?

Where do people generally store their wills? I'm a little young for that. If I store it on my shelf any thief who enters my house will be able to steal the seed. Of course I'll know about it relatively quickly and move the coins, but in the future when everyone knows what bitcoins are, the thieves might realize what they found.  
I don't trust the email idea either. Except if maybe I agree on a simple way to obfuscate it, and tell my family how to interpret it if some day they receive that email.
Maybe I'm too paranoid, but none of the above seem ideal. Thanks for the suggestions though, I appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:45:04
That is not a solution if we want bitcoin to go mainstream. It has to handle more than 7 transactions per second. Raising the fees are not an ideal way to handle this.

@_date: 2013-12-19 11:01:28
Thanks. 
However, with a buy and hold for the long term strategi, by believing in Bitcoin not as a currency, but as a payment protocol, I still think you could call that investing. 
It's like a new company that pumps everything it earns back into the company to grow it, and does not pay out dividends for the first couple of years. During this time, if you put money into shares, you still call that investing, but you do it with the hope of the stock price rising, because you know they won't pay out dividends for a good while. That's a bit like with bitcoin as I see it.
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:52:26
So if ever you've signed a transaction with a private key, by seeing the signed transaction they can work out the private key?
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:12:10
I can only speak about Electrum, since that is what I use and did a little research on.
Electrum will call on the OS to generate random numbers. That means it is OS dependent. But I don't think any of the major OS's are incapable of producing adequately random numbers.

In that case, the sentence "There just hasn't been any large sell offs yet. Just massive buys." is equivalent to saying: "The price has gone up. It has not gone down as much."

I'm an amateur myself, so take it for it is. :P 
Realizing myself that I am an amateur, I do it this way: Whenever I decide that bitcoin is a good investment and I want to invest (more) money into it, I just buy as soon as possible, irregardless of price. That's because I don't trust myself with the ability to beat the market. But because I believe that an earlier investment is on average better than a later one, I just buy at the current price whenever I have money I have decided to buy bitcoins for. 
In short, whenever you have money you want to invest in bitcoin, just buy bitcoins for that money without thinking too much about it.
Some guy disagreed with me, so use your own judging power: :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:53:01
I understand your description of what they are, thank you. :) But I still don't get the motivation. Then a technical follow up question:
I read in the Satoshi white paper that coins are sort of made out of a pool of satoshis, in the sense that in order to have a wallet with lets say 0.03 μBTC or three satoshis, that is not stored in the blockchain as "this wallet contains these specific three satoshis", instead it is just stored as "three satoshis", and when you spend one of them, you don't have to specify which of the three you're spending. It just comes from the pool of three satoshis.
So how to prevent the colored coins from mixing up with the regular bitcoins?
That was the technical part, but more interestingly perhaps, in which situations would you prefer to exchange goods for bitcoins that are coloured over regular bitcoins?

I did think about that. Also it's going to make a lot of noise which is an inconvenience, since I live in a small dorm room.
I have a special solution, in that my computer is in a closet in the hall, and not in the actual room.  . So that helps the noise, but the GPU does go to 83 degrees celsius, and the fan to 4500 RPM when mining.
I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons right now. Also, another thing is that the difficulty will rise. So in 6 months the 7950 might generate so little that it's no longer worth it and I might stop then. I don't know exactly how much wear this will bring on my card during this period.

Do we have an alternative to do those things when/if prime factoring is no longer a viable option?
@_date: 2013-12-17 12:19:07
Absolutely. However people still price their stuff by coming up with a fiat price and finding out what they should sell for in bitcoin by using the current market price. Which I guess is sensible. :)

Of course people will miss their money when it disappers. No matter the amount. It is not fun to experience. However people might want to invest some of their money. Why is bitcoin not as good an investment as stocks and bonds and so on? If people want a high risk / high reward investment?
It is not fun when you lose, but that does not mean it is necessarily stupid to use bitcoin as an investment.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:31:43
I'm not so sure. Since Bitcoin is decentralized I don't think there is the same incentive to invent something else for your own region. I don't think that there will be room for two competing cryptocurrencies at least until everyone is accustomed to just one.

Do miners decide for themselves the maximum block size? What happens when a miner decides to make blocks of 20 KB because that is easier, and so he can mine more blocks and gets the bitcoins that come with a block more often? What prevents this?

I started a SEPA transfer to Bitstamp on thursday. It hasn't showed up yet. It's very annoying that it takes so long when all I can do is watch the market go crazy these past 24 hours.
EDIT: I should mention that the money I wired had to be converted from a minor currency to EUR (my own bank takes care of this) before it got to Bitstamp (who will then free of charge convert it to USD). I don't know if this puts further delay on the transaction.

I was worried about what random number generator it used to create the seed, and looked it up. Apparently the function in the code asks the OS for random numbers, and the OS should be able to provide adequately random numbers, so that it isn't necessary to use dice. But I get your paranoia. :P
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:18:30
Thanks for the answers! I'm going to make you work a little more because this stuff is fascinating:
Are the addresses generated from a seed generated in a specific order then, so that it knows which addresses to start looking up?
Are there a limited amount of addresses that can be generated from a seed?
What can I do with the master public key? I noticed it was there, but how is it useful and what relationship does it have with the seed and the addresses generated?

Okay, it sounds like you understand better what you're doing than I thought at first. I'm curious, how well does an exponential curve compare to the quadratic one?
I'll still argue that a purely mathematical fit does a really bad job at predicting the future. If you are free to choose whatever fit you want, just because a model has a good R^2 when fitted to past data, it does not guarantee a good prediction of the future at all, if you don't try to argue that there is a meaningful underlying physical model that behaves like the function you're fitting.

If you set it to sell at 760 and the current price is higher, it will be sold immediately at the bidding price. As far as I can tell from what you write, Bitstamp is working as it should. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:12:09
I think the major difficulty in that direction is that bitcoin is not easy to use responsibly. You have to understand a lot to hold your money in cold storage safely. I'm talking about risks like using a brainwallet, using a compromised computer or an online webpage to generate the wallet and so on. 
For the masses to catch on and have a large portion of their money in bitcoin, it has to be simpler. That, or the online wallet services (which are easier than cold storage) have to be completely and utterly trustworthy in peoples mind - to the degree of a real bank.

I'm interested in this as well. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:34:24
My understanding is that this limit is in place right now as a limit to the block size. This is to prevent people from spamming transactions that will create a very large blockchain (the file is already something like 12GB). But the limit is sort of arbitrary, and can be lifted when needed. Am i wrong?

If we're going to use SI prefixes, use them correctly:

I see. That is a pretty clever way of latching on to all the mining power being spent on the bitcoin blockchain. 
What about this though: If you use it as a sort of stock, then comes time to pay out dividends. You have to pay out to people in possession of the coloured coins in proportion to the amount they have. Only way for people to prove that they are in possession of coins (shares) are to reveal their private key. Or is there a simple solution to this problem?

For example if there are no miners left or the blockchain has repeatedly hard forked into a whole tree for whatever reason.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:38:04
The problem with that, is that when you go to buy a banana with bitcoins, the store priced it by taking what it costs in dollars and converting that into bitcoins at the current market price. So everything becomes more expensive in bitcoins when the market price drops.
@_date: 2013-11-06 09:58:59
I recently bought as well. I bought at 206. That looked an awful lot like a bubble as well. And you might be right and we might be in a bubble, but no one knows when it will burst, or what price it will drop to. 
Since I believe Bitcoin will make it in the long run with high probability, I just want some coins. And it is probably better to just buy them now regardless of price and hold, rather than to try to outsmart the market. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:23:35
True. I am in the situation of living in a dorm room. Which means power costs are shared between all inhabitants.

It is an interesting point on being the first to mine a new successfull coin. But it would require some advertising or some way of spreading awareness about this new coin, for it to stand a chance against bitcoin, which is now propagating itself. I mean, quite a few supporters would have to gather around the new coin in order to make it popular.

@_date: 2013-10-30 16:28:27
This clears some things up for me. Is this all there is to it? Unless something else happens that influences bitcoin supply and demand, a stock market crash will create fiat money and the price of bitcoin will go up as people look for new places to invest their fiat money.
Or are there other factors that we haven't yet listed?
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:02:39
This is completely wrong thinking dude. 
It works like this: You have 2000 $ available and then you buy whatever amount of bitcoin you can afford for that price. So the exchange rate determines how many coins you get and is pretty much proportional to the return you see in the long run.

An attacker will try to generate a public and private key (just like you did). Then he will look at the blockchain which he downloaded, and if he finds the public address in the blockchain, and there is money in it, then he now has the private key to that public address and he steals the money.
So what he wants to do, is to generate private and public key pairs, that someone else have already generated and put money into. 
So he tries common phrases to generate private and public key pairs, and sometimes he is lucky enough to find one that someone used for a brain wallet. And then he gets happy and someone who thought his brainwallet was safe gets very sad. 
(Brainwallets can be safe. But if you don't know what you're doing they are typically not).

You can't restore from a seed while offline in 1.8.1. It will go online to check which of the public adresseses detemined from the seed you have used. So that it knows how many to generate.

I'm danish and this is NOT a final say on bitcoin from the danish government. 
The fact is that we, the danish bitcoin owners, are waiting for the government to classify it either as a currency or a commody, and to decide on whether bitcoin purchases should include VAT, whether we should pay income tax on gains (which is something like 42 % in Denmark), and so on.
The most recent news is that the danish government will announce on these matters at the end of January. They have previously announced that it would be in 2013, but it has been delayed until late January now.
[One source for this is Politiken, which in an article cites SKAT]( Specifically this part:

I think this is only true when buying for a large amount of money, enough so that you cause the price to go up while you buy. So unless you buy that much I don't think what you say is true.
With Bitcoin, over time the price has increased. So if you choose random points in time to invest, choosing the earliest will on average bring in more money. So when you decide to invest, it is on average better to just invest it all on the same day than to say fx, I will invest half now and the other half precisely in a month from now.
This is valid under the assumption that Bitcoin will go up in price over time. (And he must have this assumption since he is looking to invest in Bitcoin, so it is very much a sensible one).
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:30:25
I figure you have to be good at that to profit from it in the long run, since you pay a certain percentage fee to the exchange for every transaction. At least on BitStamp that's somewhere between 0.2-0.5 % depending on volume. Or have you found a way to do it where you can avoid that fee?

I tried that out and found that Electrum then has to get online before it can restore the public and private keys. Why does it have to go online when restoring from a seed?
Also, something else: In electrum, there are multiple public addresses in my wallet. And each has a private key as well. So all these addresses are tied to the seed somehow. Well then does my public addresses have something in common, and if you were clever, could you get one public address from that commonness, by knowing other public addresses from the same wallet?
