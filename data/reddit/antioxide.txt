Probably the single largest stabilizer of a currency is that taxes must be paid in that currency (for whatever country/region the currency is in).  Since that will never be the case for BTC, it will always be treated as a speculative commodity, rather than a real currency.

Ok, you're right, and I'm doing a terrible job of expressing myself.
I think what I'm trying to say is that there are different types of investors, speculators and 'real' investors.  Best analogy is the housing market - some people speculate in a rising market with the intention of selling before the crash (speculators), while some people buy with the intention of making money by renting out the house.  The second type has real belief in the house, because they understand the renting market and know roughly how much money they will make even if there's a crash, so they are happy with their investment.  The first type are gamblers.
In the case of bitcoins, if you have a way to make money out of them, regardless of the speculative value, then your belief in them is justified.  For example, they could make new business possible for you that weren't before, e.g. silkroad, or other (preferably legal) online businesses.  You don't care about the speculative value of bitcoins then, because the fact that they exist has utility to you.
If you are only relying on them increasing in value to make money, then you're speculating, and then they could be any asset whose value you believe will rise - you're not making use of them for what they are, or finding ways to make money from holding them, other than by trying to convince others that they will be more valuable in the future, so you can sell at a higher price.  That's the kind of person you don't need to waste time listening to, because they have the same message all the time, and it's not a creative one.

These people: seem to be having LOTS of fun.

By this definition, there are no real-world currency exchanges, since most currency trading happens directly with market makers that are banks or brokers.

I used the wrong term - I really meant "monetary gain interest".

Do you realize that just using the term 'exchange' is too broad, it covers a lot of things?  If you want to be precise, then be precise.   You are more than likely think of market exchanges, where third-parties are directly connected.  There are also fixed rate exchanges, where bids and offers are made by brokers, such as your mom-and-pop foreign exchange.  You're trying to argue that Coinbase isn't a market exchange (fine), while I'm trying to argue it still is an exchange ("that does everything via a third party").  These also exist in many major markets, e.g. the stock market in London, where because transfer of stock ownership is subject to a stamp duty, so the vast vast majority of "exchange" trading is done via brokers.
Regardless, as my downvotes show, this is an emotional, rather than intellectual argument, so I'm going to make you happy by just fucking off.

USD is also used for paying taxes.  That creates a constant, annual demand to have USD.

Being interested in something because you have a vested interest in it is different to be interested in it because you think it has extrinsic value.

What's the "force" boogieman?  Is that a Star Wars ghost or something?

There are many types of exchanges, and Coinbase offers one type.

Another likely factor is that the owner already has many bitcoins.  For example, Richard Branson's interest is monetarily motivated by increasing the value of his current holdings.

Convert all your salary to Bitcoins and see what happens when you have to do your tax return.

And that utility is based on its stability, which in turn, is based on an enormous need to acquire and spend it.  The single largest use of that is paying taxes.  The trade utility is not independent of the tax use, that's my point.  This isn't an anti-government thing, it's a recognized basis for currency strength.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:29:45
Actually it is.  You can buy and sell bitcoins on it.  Except when you can't.
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:25:20
But would you invest in bitcoins if you didn't think you could make money out of them?  From what you're saying, I think you would, so your interest isn't for monetary gain (although that's a nice bonus of course).

And now we are starting to understand the differences between regulated exchanges in the real world (where the regulations protect investors), and highly profitable bitcoin exchanges.
Edit: cue retarded discussion that Coinbase isn't an exchange, without acknowledging that there are multiple types of exchanges.
