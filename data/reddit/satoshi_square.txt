I just honestly dont see more money coming in on a large scale AT THE MOMENT. We'd need considerable new money to hold 300. most buys from my guess 150-250 are new comers and speculators and thats the chunk of 1.5+ billion that has been dumped into the market in the past month. They made "profit" they sell before they feel they lose their window of opportunity and exit to fiat due to not truly understanding bitcoin and its value. Then all veteran/ newcomers with actual knowledge of bitcoin and its protocols potential will eat up the cheap (180/200 usd)coins. Im pretty sure this will be on point. Hope im right.

Whats the site
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:51:47
honestly who in their right mind is buying right now? i was hesitant at 200 to replenish but i said if it stabilized at 200 for a few days wed see more uptrend to 300 with a collapse back to 180/200. i still think im spot on. greed is what drives people. If last month 8btc was 800 and now its 2300 it gives quite the good incentive to many to sell and "wait for cheap coin"
@_date: 2013-10-30 04:37:00
i think thats false. we see 70,000+ transactions a day so times the .000005 fee by 70k now and then just imagine the fee times if more and more people use BTC
@_date: 2013-10-08 22:04:36
Dude you took the risk in ordering it, i ordered in aug 2012 and received in aug 2013. It sucks but you should have done your research before purchasing. I fully understood at time of purchase that it may be a scam, false claim, delayed, or difficulty would be insanely high. This is all coming from a gpu miner back in the good days. It was a gamble since day one and its still a gamble. I stand behind BFL products, however their turn around time sucks... but hey; you and I and a bunch of others put our faith in ASIC aka APPLICATION SPECIFIC hardware with no resale value, atleast my old gpus had resale...

dont listen to anyones advice on here, they will say buy now because even if it drops itll go back up greatly someday.

@_date: 2013-11-07 07:32:28
honestly in this rally i dont see much more maybe 300? but i think we are in for some serious correction. Common guys do any of you trade on real markets or anything? nothing doubles in value on a month and continues to climb. Most who bought at 100 may sell soon due to extreme profits that you cannot get in a fiat industry. all im hearing from veterans and newbies is the price is getting "to high" yes it is too high (FOR THE MOMENT) long term i see 1000K+ but theres no straight line to the moon, it will go down once people need fiat/ are happy with their gains. After all isnt investing about gains and protect from potential loss

@_date: 2013-10-24 05:54:12
i honestly think you are wrong  (this time) the april spike took DAYS this spike took a month and we still havent seen april high. The whole april thingh died in a matter of a week. This time theres more people, more businesses, more regulatory updates. I think we are moving too fast yes, but price will not drop bellow 150. We gravitate towards whole rumbers that make sense, the next reasonable number to  stay near is 200. That was brought on by 1000Yen. 200USD will only cause Euro to want to stabilize at 200 which will cause the usd to want to slowly (months) gravitate to 300) I think people should hold honestly, and sell in burst over the 200USD mark

Ihate this story, all the uneducated people out there take such great input from the news. This story may delaya lot of new adopters especially those who jsut dont understand mining at all. All the new comers will see is the bitcoin fundamentals of creating coin is flawed so bitcoin as a whole is flawed. 90% will read the title and first paragraph and not even see that theres literally no chance of this happening or that it can be programed to make it even less likely to occur 
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:56:19
All these people think nononono! itll keep going watch!! Yes in the long term it will probably grow. But its gonig to cease up any day now and plunge to a nice 200/250 point i expect
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:09:20
nah its fine but all the "to the moon" people HATEEE on anyon saying we are facing a correction soon enough. They try convincing people its ok to buy at 350 even if tomorrow it drops to 200 just hold!! I think this is nonsense. You dont know their finacial situation and everyone is just trying to make a quick buck for the most part (newcomers) telling them to invest now may encourage them to make a very horrible move and lose there whole life savings. Its happened before and itll happen again. THats why i encourage all newcomers to watch from the sideline on this bubble or at the very most buy less than .5BTC to mess around with to get used to the market. 2 months ago i could have 3 coins for this rate right now, and now you are telling them to buy 1 in hopes itll go up, but if it doesnt dont worry cuz ur all spartans right...

i do believe it stores value but it is different than gold. Its something you can store value but still spend easily. Key words "spend easily" you still cant spend them easily so what justifies it as a currency? Dont get me wrong im a huge player in BTC but i just dont see this price lasting. If any of you traded penny stocks you'd understand why. Same shit just higher price. news creates buzz, new players buy, old players buy above market value to encourage a push, the push makes new commers giddy about their investment, old players dump their return, newcomers fear the drop, old comers eatup lower coin, price stabilizes higher than it was before a media storm. its so simple and idk why people are insisting to new comers that now is a good time to buy, ask yourself this ... Would you of payed 300 a bitcoin a month ago or considered it too obsurd for where btc stands in existance at the moment. We are still in alpha mode we havent even reached beta

honestly you all need to shut the fuck up about coinbase. They are a new company and if you actually attempt to explain to to them that your a good person not looking to scam they are more han willing ot help. I had your issue and you know what they did for me? They PERSONALY ensured my whitelist and took away my "high risk" stature. Just talk to them and give them time. If you truly arent a scam you will be rewarded.
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:30:53
im happy to see it climb dont get me wrong, i just personally sold the other day when 255 seemed to be a peak. I sold it dropped to 230 and i was happy. Then it climbed back up lol. Honestly i feel like some are buying above market to push the price up while newcomers watch in awe as their chances to make it big in btc shrink. This causes new comers to buy, which then causes those high buy orders to be surpassed by even higher orders and that is when mr. big buyer decides to dump the shot outta their position with the sole reason of enticing a sell off. Big players who can make the market move will believe in the longterm goals of bitcoin no doubt about it. Thats why they dont mind buying  high and performing a pump and dump in an unregulated market. But what about newbies? they dont know shit about how coin moves, its use, where to spend it even. most of the new money that has been added this month is newbies with the sole goal of turning a quick profit like the last bubble. Most dont give a shit about bitcoin and its capabilities and only want a short term gain.

I think that is true, but i also believe they are watching others come way too close to winning over a market that they need to control.

And this is business where after people make profits they like to cash out especially those who have no clue what bitcoin really is. If common things cant even get you 5% a month in fiat economy then what stops newcomers to cheerfully sell at 200%+  percent in a month. Seems uneasy at this point at this price, however i am confident we will see 300 4 months from now

i can actually verify this quite accurately for users. I had an order last week for 730USD. it went through on coinbase, i refreshed my screen and there were my coins!
NOT GREAT!!!!!!!!
Chase blocked the payment (due to me moving funds from one of my own accounts ot my other which i use for coinbase) they thought it was "suspicious" and froze my account. When coinbase later filled my order on there end ( i already had the coins but the payment was pending processing) they informed me that i had a negative ( bitcoin balance) my bitcoins were already in another wallet. I purchased 7.4 bitcoins at 97 dollars. Coinbase saved the day during the SR drop but after the payment bounced, i owed them 7.4 bitcoins or 930USD!! I quickly emailed them explaing i had short sold the bitcoins and would like to honor my original price of 730 usd to them instead of the 930 (due to price flucuation) I explained it wasnt my fault it was the bank messing up so in good faith of bitcoin Coinbase credited the BTC difference so when i went to pay for the negative balance it was 5.4 coins which at the time equated to my purhcase price ffrom fdays before of 730 usd! 
GREAT!! they aved the day!!!
I for one have only good stories of coinbase but my story here explains WHY they need Credit backup. What if i wasnt a nice guy, and left with the coins and never fixed that negative blance? they needed a way to charge u in USD if you're negative and not -BTC

ill explain it how i did to another friend recently in the easiest real world example. 
Bitcoin miners are like diamond miners when they find a "diamond" (bitcoin) they now possess something of value. 
That "diamond" (bitcoin) is worth a said amount in the market because you, me, and everyone else agrees to the fact that these "diamonds" (bitcoin) hold value. 
So now you go and sell your "diamonds" (bitcoin) for the going rate of on the market which right now = $338 USD per "diamond" (Bitcoin)
Get it?

if only we lived in a word of just coins haha. But yea, they actually sent me the coins (confirmed completed transaction on their end at coinbase) and then days later i see reversed and now they made my wallet balance a negative. the coins however were moved from the account immediately so they didnt actually retrieve them. I hope they get back to me soon, i need to make things right and have a 0 balance so i can get more

i have a bunch of coins i honestly sold today at 253 right before the drop to 230 i got pissed when i saw it go back up lol. i feel like i missed the celebration
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:05:21
i dont see august low happening but from this price to 180/200... still gonna be a really steep drop
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:21:30
they take days to charge you. good thing to practice with them is not touching the bank account attached to coinbase to ensure payment goes through
@_date: 2013-10-09 08:21:40
Gotcha i knew about hte satoshi break down of coins, i just wasnt sure how far it goes. I thought after a certain size a small tranaction becomes dust. but i guess thats today... and .00000000005 btc being absolutely nothhing

@_date: 2013-10-31 23:45:02

Anyone who has known that long should have bought atleast 20 worth, now look u got a .1!

what ever is going on this is a good reason as to why you should have a cold storage wallet no matter how much you trust the site
@_date: 2013-10-10 23:44:20
lol flyer ur banks atms ur saying? lol someone should sticker bomb bitcoin  that would be cool
@_date: 2013-11-03 07:37:18
joke for the sub man. not serious
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:02:34
and this is why the price will drop. No real mainstream markets exist
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:51:26
Congrats, you now have a heater for the winter!

Even if he is anti bitcoin think for a second here. Everything fails when a bank or government controls its quantity or value, so in theory cant a currency uncontrolled by anyone but value determined by all possibly be the answer? sounds reasonable for future intellectual beings. Why trust anyone when you can trust the voice of all basically.
The fact theres a Satoshi and not a soul creator with a face and voice may be the real reason why BTC succeeds and other cryptos fall short. People will find it easier to trust something "we all have a say in and can understand on paper very very clearly from the moment each btc is created"
Thats just me, it sounds more reasonable as a form of global economy than what exist now.

ive made my fair share. I have also had moments where i wasnt mining (due to loss of interest and power) I have sold when i wish i held. I had 1000BTC at 9 dollars sold at 20. Honestly all i have learned from Bitcoin and mining Bitcoin is to Hold but dont literally HOLD. Spend your coins people... INVEST THEM use them in the fiat world however you wish and then rebuy coins ASAP (preferably a few bucks less than your previous cash out) We are blessed with such easy things like coinbase now but dont ever turn your back on local bitcoin for cash. Theres so many ways to keep turning coins into more coins and really utilizing the economy of bitcoin in your own way.
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:50:33
then why are they in the same wallet
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:23:56
Doable honestly. we are getting closer and closer to a capital of 3 billion so i feel like thatll cause price increase majorly
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:35:46
i honestly WOULDNT see that as a bubble. This however is. If a big player entered the game it would actually bring about diversity and more transactions to the world of bitcoin. Also all users of ebay would see BTC and get interested. Something like THAT will move the price intensely. News like $26 to 800K, a ATM now in existance, ATH hit, silkroad busted but only to be reborn.. all this news justifies a temporary rise until the steam wares offf and people cant spend there coins and they cash out. It happened before itll happen again. Big investors who are actually looking to be serious with BTC will not touch something at its ATH no way in hell. Not unless they are sure senate will react nicely to BTC or a market accepts them on a large scale. They too have cashed out or are about to and will buy back in when its low

is drug money sold after a raid...
Is bitcoin even something they can classify under federal law yet. I believe BTC in its state now is easy to bend around the law especially when a fed can just say its drug related money too bad. Until they make laws on it or classify it correctly with regulation they can do w.e the fuck they want. to them its "not real"
@_date: 2013-11-01 09:53:54
im in agreement on bitcoin being a game changer, im just saying its fuckedup to blame a economic meltdown on a whole people when its less than 1% of them
@_date: 2013-10-10 00:19:56
Well the fact that i got my bfl shipment ill keep that as a coffee warmer ;). as for my asic blades ill eventually sell them and or just keep them going. After the reward system is done itll go on to transactions pay miners. and who knows what the difficulty will be like then.. .honestly there will always probably be an incentive to mine, but you need to know when to sell your miners, trade up, and buy and sell your coins. its a confusing game to play if you are not ready 
@_date: 2013-10-13 04:04:04
think of tainted bitcoins like usd "they all got a lil blow on them" lol 
i think its good SR is gone, coins can only go up from here.
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:25:34
This just happened to me too, now my buyers are freaking out becasue i cant refund hem and i wont ship my miners knowing paypal stole from me
@_date: 2013-10-12 20:57:24
lol ill be using your fliers here in NY attached to my website for coins =)
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:09:23
what experience trading real world do you even have? to say itll go up when all you have seen first hand is an uptrend is insanely bias. pull up a chart and look up april 13th 2013 and see what happened in just one day =)
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:10:00
well as an american cant i/we use btcchina and just use their currency and withdraw in BTC. Or do they not store fiat like other exchages
@_date: 2013-10-09 08:08:26
i Broke even, ive bought blades since i got my jalapeno but what can i say, im a gambler.. i play seals with clubs a lot, (tourneys), i day trade on local bitcoins, and i try to resell mingin gear at profit on craigslist. Honestly whenever im highly active in the btc world i find myself making nice profits and mining just boost it.
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:28:20
what do you plan to withdraw in?
@_date: 2013-10-10 07:12:07
sell you my blades, u can easily runm them in a dorm. or my jalapeno
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:57:30

Doubt it, i see a cup and handle happening, price hits ATH drops 20 or so percent, then recovers and climbs to new ATH
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:16:12
i day trade on the drops. Long position on savings, but anything i mine i try to day trade on 5% atleast
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:32:09
op u can just go check and see for yourself its not illegal to use tor
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:06:27
no its not people lik you saying this is. The price is part of bitcoin, it sparks conversation. Yea theres too many post about it but shut the fuck up and sell your coins
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:38:34

@_date: 2013-11-07 06:21:04

@_date: 2013-11-02 19:54:44

@_date: 2013-11-10 00:03:29

@_date: 2013-10-27 00:01:47
i have called paypal and they told me itll take "6months to refund theirt money" I have to wait 6 months to give back my customers money... FUCK THEM they are stealing money that isnt mine or theirs. I want to refund my buyers but i cant even do that. now i have 200 bucks of ebay fees (which i refuse to pay) and i told all my buyers to call up complaining. This isnt easy on anyone
