Just to say – as a direct result of this post BitStamp have been in touch and sorted out the problem. I hope the other people with the same problem also have it resolved.
tl;dr When BitStamp support do manage to reply, they're excellent.

I can no longer log into my Bitstamp account, which appears to have vanished off the face of the earth. Support requests sent last Thursday (5 days ago) have gone unanswered. 
Last week I transferred the money in (two days, excellent service from Transferwise) and then immediately bought some Bitcoins through Bitstamp on Thursday.
A few hours later I tried to login to Bitstamp to back up my wallet but it said "Wrong Customer ID or Password". Password/user recovery would not work and I put this down to the site keeling over due to the enormous traffic it was receiving.
But since then nothing has changed. My BitStamp username/password combo does not work, I cannot login at all, and there have been no replies to multiple messages asking for an update. A Twitter search suggests I'm not the only one with this problem.
In exasperation I decided to set up a new account with them using the same email address. It works fine (though obviously the wallet is empty) but you shouldn't be able to set up two accounts with the same email address so something is broken.
tl;dr BitStamp are struggling with the volume of support requests – but after a week I'd really appreciate a one-line email acknowledging that there is a problem, even if they can't fix it on the spot.

That's good to know – and I can open a new account and log into that. 
Issue is people being locked out with no support at all. Found this Twitter thread that shows what's going on:
