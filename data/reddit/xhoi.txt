I didn't but that's because having read a lots of stories of people trying to transfer money internationally with bitcoin make it seem like just as much of a hassle and costly as well (just look at that guy who was going to send a bunch of money from Australia last month)  I don't think bitcoin is quite ready yet to be the remittance tool that people think it is.  It has the potential but its just not there yet.

There are actually quite a few of them on reddit. There's lots of tech out there to help them use computers. A lot of it isn't as good as it could be (my ex always complained about JAWS) but they still allow blind people to access things most people wouldn't consider weren't available to the blind. Society still has a long way to go when it comes to fully integrating with the blind though. There's lots of miscommunication and discrimination out there.

Exactly. 
As a side note, what's with your username? You connected to Romania somehow? I'm asking because I'm currently living in Bucharest.

True for blind people using USD as all bills are the same size and the coin size is weird. The federal government actually lost a court case against the ADA in regards to this and is required to change the money to be more accessible. I haven't seen any movement on that front though. Most European countries (even those not on the euro) have currencies that are quite accessible to blind folks.

Are parents different now? I don't remember being able to have reasonable negotiations with my dad before I moved during university.

It was around $560 when I woke up this morning. It hasn't gone any lower than that so far.

Speaking from experience this is how one loses access to being able to drive the car or leave the house.

Bad luck Brian

I'm not sure would really like this. It's a much more serious sub. The humor of the price on this graph fits here perfectly though.

Doubt that would solve the problem seeing how is dad is dead.

I'm teaching Business English to a bunch of awesome high students at a private high school in Bucharest and started talking to them about bitcoins in class the other day. A few of them had heard about it before but didn't know much. By the end of class, most of them were going to talk to there parents about getting in on it. I was pretty excited to be the one to inform them about Bitcoins.

I'm also in the same boat and have spent the last month or so absorbing what I can about bitcoins from reddit and a few other sites. I made my first purchase this morning and I'm pretty happy about it. I decided to start getting involved with this right after the US senate hearing when things shot up and it got super expensive so I couldn't afford to buy anything of any real value. So I played around with faucets and bitvistor and the like. This morning I checked things as I woke up and saw that the prices had dropped to under $600 so I jumped it. I bought .3 BTC for about $175 and feel pretty happy with myself. We'll see how it goes from here. It also helps that my mom sent me my Christmas money early this year, haha, so it wasn't that much of a hit.
