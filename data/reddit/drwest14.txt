The email was titled “Important changes to BitPay Card cash withdrawals and advances.”   I got the email on Feb 27.

the young guy’s face says it all.

yah try just ACHing to your bank. It should work. That way you can access your funds while we all wait this out. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 15:10:27
Here’s what the email said:
 
”Hi BitPay Card users,
Every now and then we'll reach out to you to let you know about big things happening with your BitPay Prepaid Visa® account.
Right now the BitPay Card is scheduled for a system conversion, including upgrades to improve the systems that support your card. During the time of this conversion (starting March 8th), cash back features such as ATM withdrawals, POS cash back and over-the-counter cash advances will be unavailable. This service interruption is unavoidable, and we will make every effort to restore these services as soon as possible.
During the conversion, you will still be able to use your card to shop with Visa® merchants online and in-person. You will also continue to be able to move funds from your card to other bank accounts via ACH transfer. View our guide to ACH transfers.
We value and appreciate your continued use of the Card. If you have any questions about this notification, please contact us at  or call the cardholder services team at (855) 884-7568. We'll be reaching back out to you when cash back features are available again.”
So you should be able to still ach to your bank account? You tried that?

not what I’m saying at all. I’m saying, from a debt perspective, you don’t want to take on debt from an appreciating asset. so it’s something to keep in mind for everyone in the comments talking about crypto backed loans..

businesses have expenses and are forced to pay them in fiat.
@_date: 2019-04-21 14:59:42
Also, I’m gonna go out on a limb and guess that you don’t actually pay your rent and groceries in btc. You most likely convert to fiat at point of sale.
@_date: 2019-04-14 22:03:03
Why stop there? Let’s keep this going. Why not a healthy $500 bottom? ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:12:27
lol i think that’s up to the business to decide, not us or btc. if the guy/girl needs a way to convert to fiat, we shouldn’t be sitting here in judgement. we currently live in a fiat world with fiat expenses. if we didn’t need a way to convert, then why do coinbase, BitPay, etc all offer a way to convert to fiat? Why do we have stable coins now?
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:51:41
agreed. But all payments equate to revenue, not all payment equates to profit.
@_date: 2019-04-21 14:58:47
yes you and I might do that, but businesses can’t risk the volatility during a bear market. they would go under if they just HODL’d during a 75% drop in value... that’s why many crypto companies have failed in the last two years. they need a way to convert to fiat or stable, if needed.

I think individuals will be able to issue their own collateral backed tokens (think mortgage, auto loan) based on their credibility (think FICO score)   and/or collateral with a corresponding competitive interest rate. If they default on their payment to the token holder, then a smart contract could transfer the deed/title to the loan token buyers. which would make the token buyers whole. 
In other words, individuals will be able to market their loan on a decentralized marketplace similarly  to the centralized (banks) way we do it today.
Edit: grammar

If you had to take a loan out, wouldn’t you want it on the depreciating asset?? 
I take out a $100k loan at 4% and make interest only payments. That $100k that I owe the bank is technically devaluing itself by ~2% every year.  
When on the other hand, I could take out a loan of 20 btc at the same 4% and also pay interest only. Over a decade, that same 20 btc will be worth significantly more from a value perspective than if I took out the loan in USD. 
While we don’t know what the value of btc will be in 10 years; but that $100k loan would be worth roughly $82k in real dollars, making it the better option to hold debt.
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:14:40
anyone else read this in the SEEEEGGGGAAAA voice when you popped in a game?? 80s babies know.
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:32:49
Or the third option.. just hear me out here.. they convert in the short term to fiat on an as needed basis.
I mean it is an accurate statement because it’s true... Saying a business shouldn’t accept btc because their margins aren’t high enough is a ridiculous statement. Why should they not accept a form of payment that their customers wish to pay in? All because the HODLers out there are going to be upset, if he/she cashes out in fiat? that’s nonsense. having the option to cash out in the near term is better than not having the option at all. Hence the rise of stable coins. 
I do agree with you, that if they can afford to, the business should look at accepting btc as a speculative asset that could increase in value and HODL. Ideally, they have enough of a profit margin from customers paying in fiat, that they don’t have to cash out to fiat. But, obviously, that’s not always the case since there have been numerous crypto centric businesses over the last two years that shut down because they kept too much of their assets in crypto during a bear market.
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:14:50
lol you said you paid in btc, I’m not trying to advise you or give you my opinion.. I’m just saying you most likely convert to fiat at point of sale. Do you not?
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:16:06
made my own comment saying this same thing. scrolled down. saw yours. F
respect tho. anyone who played video games in the 90s understands
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:13:20
I think that depends on the business and how much of their revenue is received in crypto. every business is different.
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:18:58
no that’s not what I’m discussing at all. We’re talking about businesses accept crypto as a form of payment. This is revenue, not profit.
@_date: 2019-04-21 14:54:01
businesses that would like to accept bitcoin, but the current volatility makes it difficult to accept and hold. so they’re looking for a way to cash out into fiat in order to pay their bills. this isn’t a new concept. this is one of the reason why have stable coins now.
@_date: 2019-04-18 21:14:27
Take the L for the tax benefit and buy back in to reset your CB. When it goes back up, you can use the losses you took to offset any gains. Losses aren’t a bad thing if you’re long term bullish. Take advantage of it.
@_date: 2019-04-21 16:59:56
I agree with you. I’m not making an assumption that a business is running without profit, I’m making the assumption that most small businesses don’t have margins to spare. They also can’t afford to refuse a form of payment that a customer is willing to pay. It will cost them less to set up a wallet with a 1% conversion to fiat (BitPay charge) (if needed) than it would to set up a standard merchant terminal that accepts credit/debit cards. Obviously, they need to curtail to their primary fiat customers, but they shouldn’t discourage payment in a form that will cost them less to process, even if it’s converting to fiat.

I like where your head’s at, but I don’t think we need to go that far. wallet seed in a safe box with a family member as beneficiary should cover it.

more likely a few newbs fomo’d in last night and OGs/bots dumped on em.
