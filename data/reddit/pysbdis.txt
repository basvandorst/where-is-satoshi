Thanks for replying. I will be using purse to purchase bitcoin. And i have 1 question...
When it says to purchase the items from amazon, do you select as many as you want, or does it have to be all that is checked? 
Example: i want to get $150 worth of bitcoin, so i have to complete an offer on amazon, and it's naturally selected as 5 gift cards ($250) could i purchase 3 instead of 5 to earn $150 worth of bitcoin? Hope that makes sense

No have you read what is said. So if the seller wants 5 gift cards for $250, can i uncheck 2, and get 3 instead for $150? And also i only see mostly gift cards. Other is more expensive, just saw some items marked for $400.
Or do i have to buy everything marked?

I don't think i'm able to see any seller like that.
Guess you aren't a true purse user lol.
Edit: Sorry i found out i have been messing with purse and got soo many shit on my cart, that is why there are soo many best buy gift cards on my list.

If you use an amazon gift card for purchasing and know your shit... i'm pretty sure you are anonymous.

Oh you can do that? So it doesn't have to be everything checked. I just messaged the purse guy and asked him the same question.

Alright! Well thanks for helping me out. I think you may have saved me from learning it the hard way
Now i'm off to continuing my journey, to achieve my goal to feel alive again

Thanks for that (worth a screen shot for the sake of safety)
I could've sworn i heard salvia is legal in the U.S
That is how i access the dream market for tests now, thru deep . Dot . Web   isin't that the safest way then?

For real! Well if you can successfully purchase from dream market... i guess same could be done with salvia from SalviaExtracts.com? By using bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-01-14 05:41:39
I see. Well maybe i'll stick to purse.io then?
@_date: 2019-01-14 05:00:58
I know. What i'm saying is... will they see me purchase salvia from SalviaExtracts.com as an underage, who's purchasing with cryptocurrency 
(My guess is, the last thing they'll see is me purchasing bitcoin, but not the purchases with bitcoin, FYI
