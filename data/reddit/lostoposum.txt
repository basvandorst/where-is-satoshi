Be persistent.  I had trouble reaching them and my transaction stalled for a few days.  But in the end, they actually FRONTED $500 in btc so I could meet a payment deadline, provided I promised to send a check.  They mean well and aren't trying to scam you.  I think they're just a bit small and maybe overwhelmed.

If an investment doubles, it doubles, whether that's 1000 units at a dollar, or 10 units at $100.  It's just that when you're talking in more discrete units, you can more effectively diversify your investments to hedge your bets, so to speak.  
I just don't like having all my eggs in one basket, and since bitcoin has a history for instability I personally have a hard time justifying investing a lot of eggs compared to my other options in the bitcoin basket.  
But then I could be totally wrong.  I'd like to be totally wrong.

I totally agree.  I love bitcoins.  And I'm not all that surprised to see it go as high as it has.  
Do you plan to keep buying bitcoins? Or are you going to wait it out for a while?

This was exactly my rationale earlier on.  I honestly didn't expect to see it get this high so quickly.  I'm just surprised to see so many buying so high.  Surprised and happy.
My biggest fear right now is all the fuss with hardware developers like Butterfly Labs and Avaoln that are introducing what could end up being a lot of instability, or a really good thing. 
Does that have you concerned? At least with the potential instability, or do you think it will weather it like it did the monumental psychological barriers at each serious price point?

As an investor myself, I can pretty decidedly say that investing in the middle of a price rally when the price is already in great excess of historical highs in a market known to undergo a great deal of instability is a very risky, very bad idea.
I own bitcoins, and I'm certainly happy with the market today.  But I bought at $5, $11, and $30 a unit.  I wouldn't take the risk today.  Better investments to be had...

I was going to at $75.  But I've already got enough in bitcoins I just figured I'd wait it out.  Needless to say I've been regretting every day that I didn't just buy a few.  Now I'm just curious to see how it goes more than anything

Certainly not a deal breaker.  They just need to scale like PayPal or skill had to.  Just growing pains.
It does concern me in the short run, but I don't see an overnight crash or anything.  We're up so far from $100 already...

Good on you.  
I'm personally in the same boat.  I believe in the value of the system.  And that's why I've put a good deal of money into it through the years.  I see bitcoin rising to great heights over time.  Maybe not to optimistic figures like $5000, at least any time in the foreseeable future, but quite high none the less.
How long have you been investing in bitcoins?  And do you see the value explosion in the last week or two as a bubble, or part of a trend?  Are you worried about problems at mt gox and other exchanges?

I agree.  We need more users, more owners, more people willing to trade the currency in a free market as true fiat.  Right now the only people with bitcoin seem to be either people speculating on the climb, or those who wish to hang on to it long term.  That's not healthy for any currency.  
But I'm optimistic on that front.  With all the recent shit driving more buyers to bitcoin, I believe we'll see a significant increase in stability.  
The ASIC vendors do seem to be a problem to me.  Like I said, the introduction of the technology will likely have a nil effect on the markets.  But the uncertainty surrounding them is problematic.  Uncertainty is always problematic.  It always introduces unwanted risk.  That's more my concern.  That and the fact that now all these people preordering BFL miners or Avalon miners have an incentive to rally the price.  And that's how bubbles are born.

I wouldnt be surprised if you could one day.  I do believe that bitcoins will continue to gain value.  They're just getting a bit too expensive for my tastes these days. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:49:41
So what attracted you to bitcoin now as opposed to a few months ago?  Is it something you're new to?  Are you trying to risk the run and sell out the moment it turns? How far do you see it going?
