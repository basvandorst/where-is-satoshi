Well, the thing is that there are many instances of election fraud worldwide, whether that is reported or not reported. There are instances of dead people voting, ballots being thrown out, and ballots being switched. At the very least, this technology would make the raw data easily accessible, and thusly transparent.

This would be more of a procedural issue than with our machine itself. The machine is connected to a computer, which is how it uploads the results onto the blockchain. 
If we were to have say 4 different people from 4 different organizations or what have you, observe the machine and essentially spy on each other, none of those 4 people would be able to manipulate the machine.

Real time as in when they are read, they are posted to the blockchain. The project has been renamed several times, the website with our voting results is voteunits.com. At first we were going to make an alt-coin to be exclusively used for voting which is why the name. 
You can use a blockchain explorer to verify where your vote was placed, or you can go to the website where the results are posted and search for your key. 
This is a good point, and something we haven't fully worked through as of yet. We are playing with the idea of using a local blockchain, we have also thought of using a different kind of encryption apart from SHA-256 as that would make just about all ASIC chips obsolete.

Votes being bought, sold, and coerced have happened because it's impossible for it to be proven which way one has voted. In 1800's America gangs would give people a change of clothes, a shave, haircut, and/or beat them up and send them back to the polls.
If a voter, and only the voter can verify that their vote has been counted correctly, then there wouldn't be any problem with voter coercion.

That's exactly what bitcoin does though. You are able to anonymously make transactions with records being posted publicly.

Yes, however with the DAO attack exposing a fatal flaw in Ethereum's code, we are choosing to stick with the bitcoin protocol.

Appreciate the concern! Ideally this platform would be used nationwide, so that on election day there are votes pouring in from all around the country, making it impossible to single out one vote. 
We have conducted a few elections so far, for private organizations, as there are certifications that you need to pass to have a public voting machine. In the past we would load multiple ballots into the machine at a time, which would effectively protect your anonymity.
