I applied for verification almost a year ago, yet I'm still in the queue. I wonder if other people had a similar experience? For me it looks like a scam.

The Electrum desktop client, for example (click on the "Preview" button). I always check each transaction very carefully before I broadcast it.

Thanks, this is very useful!!

Putin did it.

What's the latest from Kraken?

Wow, this is so cool! I can confirm the money losing bugs with c-lightning (lost about 40$ this week), seems very buggy. I think I will also switch to lnd.

Does anybody know which app I should use to perform the mainnet lightning payment when I want to buy stuff from their store?

Thanks! Plan to try this out after work today and buy me my first Bitcoin T-shirt.

I fully agree. Lightning will allow more use cases like micro- and nanotransactions, but I don't think that it will help much to bring the number of on-chain transactions down. We need a modest blocksize increase now.

* I believe, the reason is that if you re-use addresses, then somebody with a powerful quantum computer (which will likely not exist for the foreseeable future) could steal the funds at those addresses.
 
* You should not leave your funds at an exchange, but instead store them safely in a hardware or offline wallet.

Is there any strong technical argument against a modest increase in the blocksize (let's say x2), or are there any other plans to scale Bitcoin except Lightning? I understand that Lightning will allow for many more use cases (like micro- and nanopayments), but I doubt that it will help much to alleviate the network congestion.

You can receive lightning payments on your mobile phone with the [Bitcoin Lightning Wallet by Anton Kumaigorodsk](

Note that in order to make a profit, an attacker could simply short BCH, rather than stealing money from an exchange, since a successful 51% attack should lead to a dramatic drop in the price of BCH.

The exchange would open a channel with the user after he bought 1 bitcoin and fund the channel with 1 bitcoin (at this point a tx touches the blockchain). Then the user can withdraw bitcoin via LN.

Everybody please be careful when trying out lightning on mainnet. Only use it for testing with small amounts, because both c-lightning and lnd are still buggy and you might lose money (happened to me with both clients).

The backup should only be needed for the Bitcoins that you have locked up in a lightning channel, which likely will be only a small fraction of you Bitcoin holdings. And if you decide to not use the lightning feature at all, you should still be able to recover all your Bitcoins from the seed, just as before. Somebody please correct me, if I'm wrong.

Somebody should create a Space Invaders game that is controlled via Lightning transactions (similar to what they did on the EOS testnet).

It really isn't that bad. I made a lot of successful payments on mainnet using the c-lightning implementation that Peter Todd mentions, and apart from some bugs that I encountered, it worked very well and I found it quite addictive.

You guys are so amazing!! I was sooo hoping for this to happen. Now I can finally buy anything with Lightning. Too sad I spent 100 EUR yesterday on Amazon and only read about this today. Anyway, will try it out next time.
