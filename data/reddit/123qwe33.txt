This looks great! Seems like just the kind of thing I've been looking for! Love that its fairly material design– so many crypto apps don't even try to follow the guidelines

"The parabolic curve represents an exponential increase in adoption up until median saturation, then a logarithmic decline in adoption until the whole potential population has adopted."
Is it possible that the recent rapid increase in price we've seen is actually an indication that were entering into the "early majority" phase of the "S-Curve" of mass adoption?

Thanks for the response! Not trolling, and I know that BCH had one take on the scaling debate, and BTC had another, but I'm honestly not technically literate enough about blockchain tech to understand the merits of each side.
Am I right that BCH just went with larger blocks, while BTC switched to an off-chain solution to deal with the volume?

Ah, okay, well that's good to hear! So fees should go down when the solution goes live? Is there an eta on that?
Also, could you explain b-cash a bit more? Would increasing block size get more and more out of hand as the volume increases, making it untenable for an average user to store a complete chain? That said, would that happen eventually anyway? And is that 51% risk due to a small number of miners?
As for the off-chain solution, how does that work, and are there any cons?

Cool, I'll look into that, thanks

Now to make it into an emacs package ;)

Agreed, I was looking for a version for my nook, but all I could find were epub torrents, nowhere to buy it

We could all learn a lot from Woz

Agreed, plus I'd love it to be cross platform between phone and desktop
