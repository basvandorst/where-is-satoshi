Taking today bits out of context is irrelevant. Makes me think this is a frustrating topic for you not sure why I'm sharing info on how Bitcoin can be less of a stresser for you. 
Bitcoin Futures are about to hit the NASDAQ.. but yea it's in a bubble (says sarcastically) &lt;-- there we go if that needed to be there the first time here it is now.. Jesus H Christoban Amigas go find a tree to argue with or something

Do you read about the indicators that relate to it's growth or how that indicates upward not sudden downward growth? 
Do you understand that Bitcoin Futures are about to hit the NASDAQ? 
Do you have anywhere or anyone else you can be grumpy with? 
A dip is what we call crash and someone who's hip to the step would call it a discount on BTC and a great time to buy. For sure tho the apocalypse of bitcoin looms around the corner and sh$t rock on bro

Google Bitcoin Debit Card or Bitcoin Visa. You don't know what your talking about if you don't know how to buy things with Bitcoin. There are realtors that accept Bitcoin as well as car dealerships. You don't need a Bitcoin debit card but that is one easy way to use your BTC like cash without much hassle or any high fees

BTC was about $5,850 one month ago. If you had invested $10,000, you'd have just about doubled it in a month. There is no possible way the stock market could have done the same thing no matter what you invested in within the last month. 
If you keep going back for several months this holds true meaning investing anything in stock is currently not a conservative move. The move that is most conservative isn't necessarily what traditionally sounds conservative. Conservation relates to saving and in this case generating wealth. In this instance conserving would mean holding wealth and generating interest faster not slower. Given the financial idea of conservative action the conservative choice would be to invest in the area that is generating interest faster and allows for store of wealth. 
Markets constantly change that's part of any financial sector, currently Bitcoin is a smarter and more financially conservational decision as opposed to the slow growth and high cost entry fee of the stock market.
While you can invest small amounts in stock to truly make wealth you need a fairly large bankroll $10,000-20,000 to see any growth that is quick enough and substantial enough to be worthwhile. You can't say the same for entry point with BTC or crypto currency as a whole.

Fuck coinbase they scammed me out of money via their BS shift card. I bought an order online it didn't go through via shift card/PayPal so I used gfs card it went through fine but later the charges on mine went through. Only on the shift card listed as via PayPal but my PayPal doesn't show any transaction on calling reps from Paypal told me no transaction from shift/coinbase or online retailer. 
I was able to file dispute and get covered from gfs bank. Month later I buy $200 in BTC and the same charge goes through again for a double charge..

It is a liquid assets I don't need to convert to use it's as good or better than cash if I hypothetically invested every dime I had I would be far better off than with any other investment and again able to access and use assets as if they where cash or easily move all funds back to Fiat like British Pounds or other. 
The risk involved is less than stocks if anything. I don't need to pay brokerage fee or commission my fundsove around the same way same speed more or less so in essence all of the functions that your holding as the reasons stocks are safe hold no less true with Bitcoin. Similar mechanics exist to access those assets. 
The risk is it plummeting. However it's technologically designed to generate interest as a store of value. The only thing that has stopped it going further on original run and the only thing preventing BTC from going up now would be if everyone all of the sudden just stopped using it and new users did not happen.
Coinbase just became the number one app on iOS app store, many millions of subscribers added in a week or less on Coinbase. Bitcoin at only 0.1% adoption rate. Sometimes economic trends have different indicators than a stock price or a recent merger. Look at the big picture especially with data/technology products throw out what you know think creatively. 
Great business minds, great investors, people who are smart with their money have always been good at seeing what makes sense whether everyone else gets it yet or not and backing it because they know it will grow it just makes sense and functions too well.
Bitcoin is this unique example of something anyone can access that not just one guy saw. Been a far better asset than any stock or traditional investment going into a 5th financial quarter.
You can attach a debit/credit card to a Bitcoin wallet making it real world cash without any hassle or transfer. This talk I see to speak anti about BTC seems to me to be less likely real people more likely crotchety wall street guys trying to undermine Bitcoin. 
Kind of like how the only thing traditional minds can say to shit on Bitcoin is that it's in a bubble. Something they've said since it was $2,000. This is the biggest bubble I've ever seen and if you applied understandings from former economic bubbles does not match it in long term only loosely appears as a bubble to anyone that doesn't grasp it's technical development.
Unlike stocks Bitcoin was built from ground up to do things stock can't unless stock market is redesigned from the ground up. If you stopped "investing" in bitcoin and looking at everything through the eyes of a traditional investor.. then read a lot about the programming design and really understand it's mechanism. Then let's talk about safe and unsafe investments.
Only then you won't talk to me about bitcoin being an investment because you will actually get it then. Statements like yours show a lack of understanding of bitcoin.

Sell your stocks and buy Bitcoin watch how much faster your money will expand.. 
Or mock trial that idea. Go back a month and look at how $10,000 of shares would have performed for you.
Then go back one month and look at how $10,000 of BTC would have performed for you.
Then look at how pathetic the interest gained on Amazon shares was and how much buzz that generated in news..
Then look at how Bitcoin has gone from $8,000-10,000 in a week.. 
There isn't a share on the planet that's ever performed so well. Gold didn't perform as well, nothing has. 
Bitcoin is Fintech software specifically designed to generate interest. As adoption rate goes up so does interest. It's only at 0.1% adoption rate currently. On iOS store Coinbase just became  trending app. Coinbase has added an unprecedented number of users in recent months. Adoption is happening and it's the beginning of it. 
It's still affordable to invest in Bitcoin. At least invest half of your portfolio in Bitcoin and Altcoin. You will make better returns in much less time with much less hassle. Good luck investing

Please check the attitude and bring it back to reasonable conversation. I'm sorry if my opinions or conceptualizations are stirring to or upsetting to your psyche, I didn't intend to cause you distress. Just because what I said caused you emotional distress does not make it right to lash out and call names okay? Because man I can almost taste the salt your trying to throw you salty man you.
Another friendly reminder I have stocks, I told you from start of chat I have stocks.
By the way I've benefited greatly from capitalism. I've studied and graduated with a degree in business and minor economics at University level. 
While I have personally benefited tremendously from capitalism.. I don't close my eyes ears and brain telling myself it's a good system is fair and works well.. It doesn't work well, it isn't fair, and its an absolutely awful system. Bringing up aspects of it's cracks doesn't mean I don't enjoy capitalism. I also enjoy philosophy that doesn't mean every thought I discuss is a thought I hold as my own. It doesn't mean that a perspective I convey is necessarily my own.
Have you ever heard how one of the things that makes a language capable of being an intelligent language is the ability not just to convey a message but to also be able to talk about talking to be able to analyze analysis basically the ability to meta AF is what makes a language "intelligent" 
That's another thing they say about homo sapiens (human beings) as opposed to other primate species.. We can talk about thinking, we don't just talk about wanting to eat or wanting to convey anger to another primate we can talk about talking talk about why we are talking talk about why what we are talking about exists and why it's worth talking about.. 
Those are also things that have become a facet of intellectual conversation. Something you walked away from when you began to hurdle insults. If I use the vehicle of perspective to help you reach an understanding of a subject it doesn't mean that is my personal perspective. It's a vehicle or a tool for my teaching you something and you learning in this case.
Responding in anger to a  hypothetical and to an argument against the phrasing "stocks are safe, Bitcoin isn't" Just comes off as un intelligible and in my opinion weird and uncomfortable. 
"High Teens" What the hell man I think there are more adults invested in bitcoin than teens. Why would you act Adultist when you're a parent yourself? Don't you want your kids to feel like they matter? Speaking even in anger from a perspective that indicates teens as a whole are dumb and make bad decisions doesn't really show that you believe in your own kids ability.. It's small but it isn't it's bad to talk in such generalities especially about a group who can be anything, a group we know labels are effective against unfortunately.. 
I'm not trying to rile you up or make you mad so if you don't mind being an adult in conversation or just not conversing at all until you have calmed down and can respond calmly and with thought not your emotional states. That's a strategy I was taught young. If you don't engage when you are still upset you give yourself the chance to talk again and to be intelligible in said conversation. Otherwise on record you look emotional insulting and lame. Just word to the wise you can control the info on here that you put out so maybe don't go with the gut emotional thing? Just a thought
I also shared with you how my very first stock buys went.. 10% bump in a week or less. I've even done well with stocks. That doesn't change the fact that they have been for 5 financial quarters far worse investments than any stock.
Something about stocks I have a huge gripe with.. I can buy 1 share or 1,000 shares I am charged a broker fee. Not a percentage of my total cost a flat fee. Even if you have a broker charging a percentage he or she takes far more percent than any coin fee. Coin market functions similar to stocks. 
Again.. and I say this again in the same comment because it didn't seem to matter how many times I reminded you my stock experience prior..
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:01:29
..also does it work? We see 1% of the population controlling 99% of the Earth wealth. Most of whom actually did not create an innovative product or idea, many even didn't work for the wealth they used to make wealth. 
So if it works why is wealth so unevenly distributed amongst the people on on Earth? 
If it worked the people who contributed the most beneficial ideas and products would be rewarded the highest and it would always balance itself out because if someone educated themself and came up with a great idea service or good than they would also be rewarded. That isn't how it works.
Instead we see corporations with access to data services quite literally take the ideas and dreams of their customers only to later sell the same thing to the same customers to collect profit for themselves..
So remind me how the system currently in place works well? It doesn't and that's irrefutable by numbers.
When too often low skilled people and people whom aren't innovators themself stand to grow wealthy from the brilliance of others. For example Tomas Edison and Steve Jobs.
Thomas Edison was well known to patent the ideas his employees made. Steve Jobs more sinister he created the Mac UI from stolen code Motif, along with getting fired from Apple he went to Next a company who specialized in Bleeding Edge tech. Return to Apple with innovative new design/tech right after leaving Next..
Why have faith in a system that regards thieves liars crooks and bullies as the highest Calibur people? I personally would rather see a system that is built for anyone to use thrive..

Regarding Risk.. 
The same can be said for stocks, bonds, or any other investment. All investments are a risk. At the end of the day for last 12 months or 4 financial quarters. Bitcoin has vastly outperformed any individual stock. If you want to include other cryptos than there are many options for investments in Crypto Coin that have for the last year or 4 financial quarters vastly outperformed any stock individually as well as many grouped together. The stock market has been dead and is an old lifeless system that doesn't agree with modern society and economics as a whole. 
The stock market/bonds/traditional financial system is a rigged game setup by rich for the rich. It's very hard to succeed in stocks without massive wealth. Not same holds true with crypto, and for a year running. This is at the early adoption phase. 
The Stock market/traditional financial system has never shown this same potential. This is a unique investment for a unique time period based on specialized Fintech software. It works because of the time we are in the infrastructure we have that is now so accessible to masses like never before. Again, not the same can be said of the stock market.
Bitcoin futures are about to hit NASDAQ or so I have heard. That would not be happening if this where not an important bit of software/financial tech. Not that it won't dip, but it certainly will on long term trend only go up. Especially as adoption rate rises. I understand it's scary because it undermines stocks and traditional financial markets but it does it so easily because that's the era we are in. It just makes sense. Like the engineering term KISS.. everything is better when you Keep It Stupid Simple. Current financial structure is not simple and is very limited. Crypto coin opens a plethora of options an idea processes that are groundbreaking and not limited

Never too late percentage of interest gains on any amount of money. Start now be aware things can change fast keep informed. 
Download Coinbase check prices and set price alerts, go to Coinmarketcap.com check prices as you can. Invest in alt coins for lesser trade the interest gained up for Bitcoin later. 
Many ways to get in now. Just start take it one step at a time at your pace and it will workout well. Bare minimum you learn valuable investment skills.
I wasn't getting the stock market thing prior to getting into Bitcoin investment. Once I understood Bitcoin better I started portfolio and gained 10% interest on shares in 1-2 weeks. I attribute the success of observing financial trends to my peaked interest in Bitcoin investing/fintech software. 
Good luck It's been one of the greatest things I've ever done for myself and has seriously changed my life for the better, I couldn't encourage it more.

That's also called research and analysis of a market or financial trend. You can call it one phrase and negatively frame something or you can be more analytical and understand trends with statistics. 
That's literally one of the more narrow minded statements I've heard. That suggests that no information existing on any subject is relevant to understanding said subject currently, as a whole, as a trend, or based on it's past. 
If that was something that where true in investing or any subject our progress as a group/species would be seriously stunted. Have a great day if you're old world with your finances I suggest you try a small investment of $10-100 in BTC or another trending crypto coin. I'm sure that your own interactions would help you to have a different opinion.
If investors did not look at trends and the history of an investment then they would be very bad investors. This idea of hindsight bias is ludicrous and near sighted I'd suggest expanding your view on data analytics.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:37:39
The first stocks I bought gained 10-15% after 1-2 week span. That was very lucky more than anything. I'm not against stock market and I'm an example of someone whose has a good return with little money invested.
The interest stocks have to offer is still nothing compared to crypto and the cost for each trade high. The fact is significant gains on a stock portfolio are only made if you have enough wealth to deal in numbers. The issue as well being the stocks making significant jumps are generally costly. 
The points I'm trying to make are that One.. the entry point and barrier of entry in stock market whether it's in cost of entry or having knowledge enough to make wise investment decisions is much higher entry fee and difficulty ton understand/learning curve. 
The second one being the stock market is an old archaic system that does not mesh well with the modernization of infrastructure particularly in digital space regarding business and finance. The advancements Bitcoin and other Cryptographic Currency have made are advancements that cannot and will not happen with traditional Fiat currency or Markets. It isn't possible for them to adjust appropriately because of the way they where devises on inception in early days. 
Bitcoin and Cryptographic Currency is gaining the traction it's gaining because it's specifically designed to mitigate what ails the current system in structure, design, and technical function. It won't stop being a better investment. It would be to difficult to rewrite and re mediate the structure of the current financial markets; stocks, bonds, futures, and they won't go away but you can bet that blockchain technology and the advancements made from it along with other advancements crypto has provided will be getting worked into all aspects of life eventually much like AI, or the internet/data services in early days.
It is groundbreaking tech that isn't going away. I'll invest in anything that's legitimate and makes money. Fact is if you look at the tech, the nature of society/data connected life, the trends/historical data Bitcoin will be a better and better investment for awhile. It will also have dips that is to be expected, and it might even completely crash again, but it will always come back. All part of the design all part of accepting new technology as norm. 
The idea that Bitcoin is risky is illegitimate it isn't any more risky thank stock trading. Both are going to tell you the same thing..
"Don't invest anything you aren't willing to lose, any investment comes with some risk."
If we apply the same advice strip away names except "investment" we can say very easily given data Bitcoin has proven to be a better and safer way to invest money for the last year and it continues to be moving into it's 2nd year and 5th quarter as an investment that is gaining significant interest. 
The same can not be said for wealth invested into the stock market. Returns have been dismal at best, and the indicators for continued growth/potential to grow are low. Everyone is cheering Amazons growth from black Friday, but in comparison it pales to BTC/Cryptographic Currency Market potential for growth and actual growth. 
Economists/Finance Experts look at indicators to understand trends, if only 0.1% of the Earth has accepted Bitcoin and is using it actively and this is the growth we see. What does that information indicate to you about it's potential as an investment in the long term? 
Given it's structure adoption rate only serves to improve interest rate. The adoption rate is only getting better and will continue to do so. If all this is true then what's safer about stocks? Nothing. You can buy a home or a car with BTC directly, or Groceries, or Insurance, or anything you need. 
What's safe about investments that gain less interest take longer to access and are most definitely going to be taxed for capital gains? Nothing
The only thing safe about it is the idea in your head and others who've invested in old world stock market that it is safe because it has existed longer. Nothing about investing is safe. Investing in something that's less easily accessible more highly taxed shows far less potential for growth and has already hit about as much of an adoption rate as will ever be seen. Per capita investors in stock market are not going up in same rate close to it or at all.
The only thing that matters is people believing in and creating value in an asset or investment by using it in real world. Bitcoin doesn't even have a single percentage of the Earth using it and it's where it stands now.
You cannot unless simply going off of an idea that is comforting say that stocks are safer. Sure they feel safer but they cut and dry are not. Bitcoin isn't safer either. Investments hold risk. 
Given economic trends indicators and factors of market growth we can safely assume Bitcoin stands to go up a great deal while the stock market stands to grow as slowly as it always has. Aside from the 90s tech boom recent bursts in interest have been dismal and slow at best

Just like anything being educated/educating yourself is the first step to success and a less bumpy ride in any venture. 
It's not as complex as it seems looking outside prior to delving into Cryptographic Currency you would be surprised. I've been surprised by the folks I'll speak to about the subject and who grasps and contextualizes the subject/technology behind vs those who don't.
I notice it's often easier for the less tech savvy to contextualize as opposed to those whom I know are actively working in technology. Some technical professionals I speak with definitely jump on board with, already know, or grasp the idea quickly. 
While others just don't seem to get it and give impression they have thoughts it's a scheme or setup and not something real or tangible. I definitely encourage reading into any subject you jump into but I can say that I couldn't recommend it more highly to anyone especially if your curious at all even a small investment of $10-50 is a fun way to see the potential and interact with BTC hands on

Not a teenager and never encouraged not to diversify. I made a simple point. If one investment is liquid meaning you can use it as cash as well as convert it to cash without risk of losing it quickly, it isn't unsafe. 
You have a problem with perspective. You seem to think of bitcoin as nothing but an investment. I don't think you quite understand it's potential use if your worrying about it being "risky"
In investing if an investment is no less liquid and no less accessible than any other.. then it is no less safe.. the idea that "Stocks" or traditional investing are any safer is ludicrous.
Investing comes with risk, always. If one investment has a far better payoff and is no longer accessible or liquid than any other asset it's a safer investment. You are held back by a preconceived notion that stocks are safe. 
Also you have seemed to entertain this conversation the whole time with the notion I don't invest in stocks. I explained from the beginning and the duration of these messages I do and didn't discourage it. 
I made an argument for a point. What would have been unsafe about investing in bitcoin if you could access it use it and didn't have a tremendous risk to lose it or it's associated value? Nothing more or less than current risk with any other investment. The truth.. it's a better investment cut and dry it's proven so going into a fifth financial quarter. You made a really bad decision to back stocks more than crypto because you lack the foresight and understanding of it as a whole that's clear in your salty responses.
Also clear when you continue to drum a perspective that I didn't exactly argue against. The main thing I made a point for was to contextualize what is it about bitcoin for you that feels any less "safe"
Because at the end of the day it's your feelings not the reality of the investment. Also can you please next time when you feel like you don't have a response other than "High Teens" either wait until you can come up with something intelligible, say nothing, or actually from the beginning of our chat respond to the things I am saying as opposed to just being a counter voice. It's clear you didn't absorb anything I said because your responses make that clear. You where responding to a person you wanted to respond to who I guess is an anti capitalist anti diversification monger. I argued a point about what "good" and "safe" investments are. Your response never addressed the reality I kept sharing backed by facts and data not emotional attachment to a specific system. 
Also I never insulted you I'm trying to help you understand this idea of a "safe" investment never existed read anything about investments that's the first thing you're going to be told or read. The concept that the stock market is safe is something a person who has a thing veiling grasp of history and reality would clasp onto. Have a good day though you "invest" however makes you're widdle Biddle selwf fweel safe and cozy and able to rest at night with your "safe" investments.
No investment is safe Bitcoins proven a better investment for 5 financial quarters any business that performed as such is a phenomenal investment. Say whatever you want however you want it doesn't change the data or money being made. My communication was supposed to be eye opening and perspective changing for an old world stock selling curmudgeon not upsetting.
It's a perspective problem you have not a lack of understanding of diversification of investment that I have and I shared that with you since we started this conversation. 
You saw that I proposed a hypothetical regarding the performance of Bitcoin proposed a "What If.." then you seemingly couldn't help but latch on and defend the idea to the death that diversification is key stocks are safe Bitcoin isn't and also that the person you spoke with was suddenly because you decided it.. an ardent anti diversification supporter.. again which I'm not. Go back to wall street and make your money instead of shill/shit posting a Bitcoin thread you grump

Yes. But I say yes because I just bought $200 coin and somehow it was all sent out of my account for "overstock.com" I ordered something from overstock well over 2 months ago. The assistance from overstock and coinbase was none. I cannot recoup costs I would not recommend trusting coinbase.
Fund immediately sent prior to my being able to send to wallet.
