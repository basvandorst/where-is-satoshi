Not sure what you mean here.  Seems kind of silly and just an unnecessary attack.  
I just logged into Paypal to transfer money someone sent me to my checking account and apparently I've reached my monthly limit...lol.  Screw paypal.
People just need to know how to use bitcoin, they think it's some super nerd thing.

I have no idea what the point of this game is.

Mt Gox is the past.  Downvoted.  This should only go to Suspected FUD spreader.

It's not OUR money, so it's no good.

Many people are afraid of it simply because they haven't used it--even for really, really small transactions.

You guys want bitcoin value to rise?  You're going to have to increase the network effect.   Have you been giving small amounts to friends and family and installing the software on their computers and phones?
If fewer people are using bitcoin, it won't work.

25 cents worth.  Top get the hang of it.

That's great!

You are BITCOIN JESUS!

Dude...chill.  I'm pretty sure no one is worried about losing a quarter.

The sellers are selling lower and the buyers aren't buying higher.

The things the bitcoin community are doing are not harassment.  We LIKE the guy.  We may be just making him a celebrity but no one is harassing him.
Also, we have and continue to raise money for him and his ailing mother.

There is a theory that people don't mind others succeeding if as long as they don't come from their group.  Central bankers are beyond reproach for most people.  They don't care how much they are shit on as long as folks like themselves don't get ahead.

The good thing is as prices go down, more people move into bitcoin.  If it gets low enough, the base will expand a LOT.  It is much easier for people to justify hedging their bets if they don't have to spend as much--even anti-bitcoiners.

Bottom line:  Once they spend it, it's gone.   There is no creating it at will like the current central bankers.

THIS IS FUNNY AS HELL!

It comforts you that your money is worth less than half what it was 20 years ago.  
Bank-Issued Money...no one cares if you steal it slowly.

Dude...you are trolling so hard.
