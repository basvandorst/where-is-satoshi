the user base we mostly have are beginners with crypto and this way they avoid having transactions stuck. Jaxx is using BIP39 therefore the wallet seed can be used with any preferred wallet out there that suits your needs.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:31:36
for the beginner user's convenience of not getting transactions stuck.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:20:25
we're using fees provided by:  which is kind of an industry standard ensuring transactions are being processes in a timely manner. You are definitely free to use any wallet you see fit for your needs.

Hey there, we are quite backlogged with the huge influx of new users lately but I've replied to your ticket and we'll keep a tight communication there for the details that our devs would need to look into this.
@_date: 2019-07-18 19:17:33
Good choice!
@_date: 2019-07-18 19:17:23
Indeed for consistent amounts that you're not constantly moving a hardware wallet is the safest choice, always.
In general hot wallets are as safe as the device they are installed on. Computers get hacked all the time and your mobile device can be stolen too. With the advantage of mobility and ease of use, Jaxx Liberty is great as a hot wallet as you can install it on your phone too, but everyone should indeed know that you need to keep your device very safe so that the assets in your hot wallet are safe too.
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:53:24
Where have you asked the rest of the question? To my knowledge we have updated our daemons on Wed last week and have been working to fix a couple of the clones with small kirks. What specific detail are you looking for? I can ask the devs tomorrow morning when they get in.
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:00:31
:) No problem, thanks for clarifying.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:49:30
I perfectly understand, no worries. We're working hard to make Jaxx better. Right now the primary security level should be at the device level as we believe adding more and more layers just hinders the user experience. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-10-09 20:35:07
 The Jaxx Wallet app files will not back up to your iCloud/iTunes. You need the 12 word Backup phrase to restore access to your full wallet or  individual Private Keys to restore access to the respective assets. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:01:55
If/when it gets activated we have expressed our choice to adjust our nodes to support the tech so our user's funds are safe. We're not involved in the politics, development or promotion of it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:04:42
I think we're going a bit too far into the situation here. Our devs will evaluate the situation and make the decision towards supporting the development when we get closer to the event and we'll have some public information at that stage.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:22:34
Hey. I'm not on 24/7 unfortunately and just noticed this.
I think there is a bit of misconception here and you'll need to clarify a few things for yourself regarding what segwit2x means et all but in a nutshell, segwit2x will not create a new coin. What happened with BCH is a different thing. Once segwit2x is active, it will be a new process on the BTC chain, no new coins, no splits, no replays needed.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:41:52
Not being Open Source doesn't mean the code is not available for you to see it but it means it's not open for others to modify or use.
_Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder **provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.**_ 
The same code is used on all platforms. You can download the Desktop version and you have all the files and can audit the code without any issues. We even post the code on our website generally, just we're ultra busy lately and didn't get the chance to update it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:33:06
As a multicurrency wallet we are not engaging in supporting (on the politics sense) one coin or token. We will work to offer our users the safest options for the coins and tokens they hold in the Jaxx Wallet. If that means for BTC to add segwit2x support in Nov. then we will do that if it provides the safest option for our users.
We're not ones to decide which BTC is the _real_ BTC and which one is not and so on.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:12:05
Not looking to start an argument here but the seed is encrypted, not leaking, and the device needs to be secure as well otherwise everything is exposed not just Jaxx. Also, smartphone apps are sandboxed.
That is the envisioned security model to allow multiplatform syncing.
 
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:02:04
the website is back up. There was an issue with a certificate but our devs sorted it out. It expired given that we haven't been supporting the product in a while.
We have discontinued it, but we still left the website up for the users that might have been using it in the past and didn't get the chance to get the funds out.
Please move your funds to Jaxx or another wallet to ensure they are safe long term in case we decide to bring down the website.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:02:47
What you are referencing is Bitcoin Cash or BCH if I understand correctly.
However, I think this topic is about the coin with the BTC ticker (currently named Bitcoin) that is supposed to get segwit2x in Nov. If that happens Jaxx will ensure that the BTC coin holders in Jaxx have their funds in a safe manner.
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:28:45
Actually the Private Keys are not even saved on the device, they are derived every time Jaxx is opened.
Only the 12-word Backup Phrase is saved on the device (only on the device, not on any server) and I confirm that it's encrypted.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:38:34


I can't really have an opinion there. BTC is implementing SegWit2x and this is what it means from a functional stand point: 
With Jaxx we are trying to offer as many options (coins/tokens) to our users based on popularity. We don't have a political opinion on which is Bitcoin, new Bitcoin or the _real_ Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:04:04
In short no, we're not involved in that _segwit2x thing_. Jaxx is a multicurrency wallet. Not just BTC and not supporting a specific tech. We will always ensure that all technologies approved by the majority of a network are also adopted by our wallet so our users funds are safe.
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:25:39
if this is a recent issue of yours, know we have disabled BTC temporarily. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:20:56
There is an announcement for BTC to adopt segwit2x sometime in Nov. Not sure what you mean with the hash rate and breadwallet analogy...
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:27:00
That is also missing the point. Jaxx is being developed by Decentral with it's own developers. It's not Open Source and it's not looking for the community to contribute with code audits/modifications. Jaxx is not Open Source.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:32:07
Hey there. How is this safety action making you say that?
We're temporarily disabling BTC until we're sure the transactions don't replay along on Bitcoin Cash and cause issues for our users. That is a rather responsible action and everyone in the industry is doing it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:17:01
I didn't answer your question because I don't think there is an answer for the question the way you formulated it. I provided some background info and I would suggest you do some online research on segwit2x.
Segwit2x is just a "patch/upgrade" of the BTC blockchain (segwit is already active). There will not be another chain split like the one that happened on Aug 1st and that created Bitcoin Cash (at least none announced yet).


Can you link me to anywhere where it says that there will be a segwit2x coin that isn't BTC?
I can then answer your question better I believe.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:25:57
One way to see the code is to download the public Desktop Build and check out the files there. It's a zip archive.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:32:29
I think the debate we are having here is more towards the concept of Bitcoin rather than the actual topic.
Rest assured we will take measures to ensure our user's funds are safe. History shows we've done that in the past when the ETH/ETC chain split and now with SegWit being active on BTC.
The baseline of the discussion and correct me if I'm wrong, was what will happen when SegWit2x is activated.
Based on my understanding, SegWit2x will be activated on BTC. What currently is called Bitcoin and has the ticker BTC (this one: 
SegWit2x will not create an additional coin, but will go forward according to the NY Agreement. Based on my understanding, what is now BTC (e.g. Bitcoin), as of SegWit2x will still be BTC with this upgrade implemented.
Regarding the potential chain split with the blockchain that will reject the 2MB blocks and that will potentially create 2 chains, one that accepts 2MB blocks and 1 that doesn't accept 2MB blocks. We don't have a stance on it (as it's rather soon), but as always (see the somewhat delayed BCH implementation), we, Jaxx, as a multicurrency wallet will give our users what the majority would want.
Please understand that this isn't about politics, this isn't about which is the _true_ Bitcoin or not. Jaxx is a multicurrency wallet that our users enjoy and just as we've been doing so far, we'll keep adding coins and tokens that the community wants to use. Be it BTC, be it BCH, be it the new coin that will potentially be created if a split happens in november during the segwit2x and so on.
I hope this clarifies the topic discussed in this thread and provides an answer. As soon as our teams decide more regarding the potential outcomes of SegWit2x, be sure we'll let the community know.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:25:34
Jaxx is not Open Source.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:40:55
Can you point me anywhere where it says that segwit2x is creating a new coin?
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:23:45
Can I kindly ask that you research that online thoroughly to find all the answers you need?
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:45:31


@_date: 2017-08-03 14:30:28
With the latest version we published (1.2.24) we've done some work on the BTC fees and since the mempool is quite empty now you can also use slow. I did it the other day and I got a few confirms in an hour or so. It depends on how quick you want to spend and get the transaction through.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:36:41
Please read all the comments and the entire situation there and you'll see that the device was compromised which caused the issue. There is no evidence that Jaxx caused this and nobody has lost coins so far (and proven it was Jaxx's fault). Devices need to be kept safe otherwise attackers can get anything of of it. I'd appreciate kind-er words from you if possible.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:17:18
Current development is only focused on our internal team and in a private git repo. That is advantageous for us atm.


The code can be audited in the Desktop build that has the files locally.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:56:36
Thanks for the ping.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:22:44
But you still have full control of your assets through the 12-word Backup Phrase and the Key pairs. Not Open Source doesn't mean we control user's funds or even keep them on any server.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:04:57
Yes, we're re-indexing the blockchain and that takes some time. We are estimating that it would take us 1-2 weeks from the moment we started.
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:16:45
Hey there, did you install Jaxx and tried to gain access to your Bitcoin? You can get Jaxx Liberty from [
That QR code may be your Private Key that will allow you to transfer your Bitcoin around. After setting up a new Jaxx Wallet you can scan that QR code through the Paper Wallet Import process. Here are more details on how to do that: [
PS. The amount of BTC you bought is a bit low. Transacting it (even importing it into Jaxx) will mean you need to pay miner fees to get it moved.
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:13:45
You can enter your 12 words phrase into Jaxx Liberty (available on 8 platforms) and have access to 80+ coins and tokens: [
@_date: 2019-08-26 15:14:46
This is the correct answer. While I'm not that familiar with Coinomi's wallet, knowing that we used to have a non-HD wallet for ETC (and way back, for ETH as well), you need to iterate through both while for X you only need to do 0 and 1 (External and Internal) as for ETC, change addresses are also used.
This also explains why you are able to see only *part* of your transactions.
*PS&gt; Transactions exporting is coming to Jaxx Liberty as well, soon.*
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:01:11
We've been through a lot with the BCH implementation, we're happy to have started the roll-out on it yesterday and there were many lessons learned during all this time.
We didn't just implement the BCH chain, we built a new proprietary way to store the blockchain info into the db that will allow us much swifter development in the future as Jaxx grows.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:30:51
I thank you for your feedback. I will take this internally and see what is decided regarding the upcoming segwit2x.
Jaxx will for sure show it's users the correct coin tickers and balances as the rest of the industry. I don't think we need to take it as far as considering something like this a legal matter.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:11:40
Yes and thank you. First thing any user should do when opening a new wallet, not just a Jaxx one, should be to copy and safely store the seed which in Jaxx is a 12-word Backup Phrase here: - MENU &gt; Tools &gt; Backup Wallet &gt; View Backup Phrase
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:08:49
We're not publishing shit but anyway..Just wanted to let you know that BCH has been released yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:06:26
I'm sorry you feel this way. BCH was more than just the BCH implementation for us in terms of process and we're happy to have just released it. Hope you'll reconsider.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:07:44
Sorry to hear that and I hope to see you back with Jaxx in the future. We know there's some perks at the moment but the devs are really focusing on getting the infrastructure top-notch atm.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:09:28
We released BCH yesterday and yes, the S2X will be claimable the same way BCH is now. That is after replay prot is implemented.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:57:36
Hey guys. I know there's a lot of confusion over this and apologies for seeing this ping just now.
We are indeed signers of the NYA but I don't see how and why, at least initially, we would drop BTC. We'll keep the naming as it is as there seems to be a bit of consensus about that at least. BTC - Bitcoin Core, S2X - Segwit2X BTC.
Hopefully, S2X will have replay protection in time for the Nov 16th fork and at that point, Jaxx will implement the S2X wallet too.
You will get both wallets, BTC and S2X in Jaxx, at least for a while, until there is an internal decision on which is which or a general industry agreement on which should get the majority of support. Even then we might not drop the less supported one but we'll see how it goes.
The way things would work for the S2X coin, we're envisioning a similar claiming process just as the BCH which we managed to launch yesterday.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:45:14
Jaxx uses BIP39 for the seed generation/import. It's a standard among many wallets.
We also have a Paper Wallet option, if the user needs to swipe only one BTC(or other asset) balance.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:47:57
Appreciate the shoutout!
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:47:01
This is indeed very important. Do not share your 12 words with anyone or any software you don't 100% trust.
Those 12 words will grant direct transfer access to your wallet assets. Anyone having those 12 words can transfer your BTC out of your wallet independently of you/your wallet/device.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:42:42
Hi! Jaxx follows the BIP39 standard for the 12-word Backup Phrase it generates when users created new wallets. You should be able to import your Jaxx wallet phrase into any other wallet that supports 12 word BIP39 mnemonics.
Why are you looking to change wallets? Anything we can help you with, regarding your Jaxx wallet?
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:43:38
Your 12 words Backup Phrase from Jaxx is valid on any other platform that supports 12 word wallet seeds. When generating wallets, Jaxx uses the BIP39 standard which is a widely spread standard in the industry.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:38:37
Thanks for stepping in, that is correct. With Jaxx Liberty we're now fetching pricing info directly from major exchanges to show a more accurate result.
@_date: 2019-09-04 14:01:42
Hello. Based on the information we have from you on the support ticket you filed with us, you had a Jaxx wallet a long time ago and never backed up the mnemonic.
Now you're trying to access it again and you can't, and since you don't have your 12 words backup phrase and the wallet is not currently paired on any device, there isn't a way for you to access your wallet.
As explained via the support ticket, we never have your wallet security information, it's always stored on your devices. We'd really love to help, but there isn't much we can do really as we never have that information to recover it for you.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:38:27
Have you tried posting in We haven't seen your post there and I've just asked the mods, nobody saw or deleted a post of yours in our subreddit. We would have responded the same as we did here, there's nothing to refuse.
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:05:55
So none of the words in your Backup Phrase match that dictionary? That is odd.
This is the exact dictionary we are using in the Jaxx code: [
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:06:54
I completely empathize with the fact that it's a large amount and I know you've diligently done that process but maybe there's a word misspelled or missing.
With recent versions of Jaxx (as of december 2017) we've even implemented an additional security mecanism that checks that the address listed in the UI on the wallet page is indeed an address part of the wallet phrase. We've done that in order to counteract potential device breaching, where a perpetrator might change it in the UI. This and the fact that mathematically, the address generation process can be replicated fromt he 12 words with identical results makes it almost impossible to think that the words you have are the ones you had at that point in Jaxx.
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:23:44
Your post does not show up for me when I check the subreddit directly, i’ll look into it why.
But you gave me a direct link in the other discussion we had and I was able to find it via the link you gave me. When I saw that a jaxxdaniel messaged you on the thread and I dm-em you immediately to use caution and never share any wallet information with anyone, not even valid Jaxx staff.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:18:48
Hi there, we've discussed your root issue thoroughly in your original post and I completely understand that you're looking into it further, but this post title is implying there is a glitch with the Jaxx Wallet app while there was no conclusion or proof that there actually is one. Plus, the post itself is not discussing about a Jaxx glitch but asking for details over the xPub Keys.
I would highly appreciate if you could repost it with a changed title that is more relevant to the content of your post, otherwise there may be many people reading just the title and potentially spreading false information. Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:01:47
I'm not saying that your device was breached, what I'm saying is that the odds of Jaxx giving you the wrong address is very slim. Besides the BIP39 process, which is fully matematical and can be replicated, we also have that UI check that would basically render the fact (Jaxx displaying a BTC address not part of the phrase) impossible.
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:03:45
He submitted a support request to us and we've said the exact same thing based on the hunch he has the other Backup Phrase.
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:37:34
The derivation path in Jaxx is the same one as on iancoleman. The same 12 words would render the same addresses for BTC and in the same order as iancoleman.
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:03:14
Hi there, did you test what we mentioned as a response to your support ticket? That test will tell you if you have the right Backup Phrase or a different one than the one you've sent the funds to.
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:54:41
Oh, ok, I see what you mean, apologies for the misunderstanding.
If the phrase is correct, and you can't find the addresses you sent the assets to when using a generator like iancoleman, this may simply mean that unfortunately you have another phrase now than the one you had when the assets were sent to the wallet.
@_date: 2019-09-19 19:18:49
The address should have changed after the first transfer. Maybe you got to check after the 10th. And the address should have changed after this other transfer as well. Like it's been mentioned, it's due to the BTC wallet being Hierarchically Deterministic, a standard feature. You should be able to see all your historical addresses in the MENU &gt; Tools &gt; View Private Keys after selecting BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-11 15:55:51
Hey there, so sorry to hear that you've lost the crypto you've saved all that time. When somebody loses their funds, or access to their funds, it really gets very sad for us here in the support team as this is something we definitely don't want to hear is happening to Jaxx users.
The thing is that this is why we are approaching a high level of security, nothing gets saved on any server to avoid any type of breaching. All Jaxx users are 100% in control of their keys, on their local devices which brings this to another point which is that user device security is hyper important. Backing up your wallet, making sure you have local security layers (login passwords, fingerprint auth on the phone, Jaxx PIN etc.) ensures only you control those funds.
Another thing we also highlight is to hold life changing amounts on hardware wallets. Jaxx will soon release a hardware wallet too, but in the meantime there are a lot of other great solutions out there. Jaxx is a hot wallet, we always advise our users to only hold day to day funds in Jaxx.
One other thing, if you've been hacked, and your funds stolen (which seems to be the case), maybe you can do an audit, trail where the funds got to and see if you can get them back, or if you want to get the authorities involved etc.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:08:40
That's a million dollar question :) 
I don't think anyone knows.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:09:49
Your BTC will be untouched in terms of balance amounts. You will get the BCC (or as it seems it will be called BCH) _for free_ if we can call it that.
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:02:47
Jaxx is built for ease of use, for the ones that don't know all the ins and outs of crypto and how many sat/b a tx costs or what even a satoshi is. We built Jaxx to ensure utilisation without hassle and ensuring diligent transaction time.
To get the fees we're using an industry standard feed from 
Here's the exact api we're using: 
There are three levels you can set in Jaxx as you know. We use: "fastestFee" for Fast "halfHourFee" for average and "hourFee" for slow
This relieves the user of delays in processing their transaction.
@_date: 2017-07-17 09:25:05
Don't mean to get into an argument here, just saw the thread and wanted to clarify a couple aspects.
How would you define a Hot Wallet if not one where you hold small amounts?
I know you're saying giving the option of encrypting the seed with the PIN, but once that option is there it becomes a rule and it hinders the user experience to have yet another password in an app when they already have one on their device etc. and another thing they can forget and get locked out of their funds. It's easier to just setup the device passkey/fingerprint and you're secure 100%.
I'm not sure if you know the entire story with Monero. We invested hundreds of hours of dev work to create the integration to make it work and they changed stuff so our code wasn't working anymore. We can't take that risk and implement it to only have Fluffypony change one thing and cut off all Jaxx users. They refused to integrate or maintain any type of compatibility. There was no terms dictation form our side. What could have we done? Full story here: 


Based on what we see in support it's a variant of people not understanding how crypto works, how wallets work or seeing a fiat exchange of 0 (bug on iOS due to Apple not reviewing our update) and  claiming they have been hacked. 


Impossible. Also apps are sandboxed so there is no information shared as long as the device is not jailbreaked or rooted. And be sure to download the Jaxx app only from the official store. We have seen some potential reports of duplication but couldn't confirm or determine the source.
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:02:01
The 12 word Backup Phrase (or mnemonic) is the key to unlock all your wallets (all coins and addresses) whereas the Private Key can *unlock* only one address, it's Public Key pair.
You are able to use the 12 word Backup Phrase with other wallets, it's not limited just to Jaxx.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:27:11
You can peak at the source code. 
Seed stored locally, no Private Keys stored anywhere. Auto generated when opening the wallet.
You also have access to all your Private keys and seed to keep safe somewhere else or import in other wallets.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:28:16
The amount of BTC you have in your BTC Jaxx addresses at the time of the fork will show up as Bitcoin Cash as well as soon as we integrate it in Jaxx, yes.
@_date: 2017-07-12 05:57:24
Current Jaxx versions don't have that option anymore.
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:56:01
Yes. Jaxx Liberty creates wallet 12-word phrases based on the BIP39 protocol. Standard amongst wallets.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:36:47


I actually like long answers as it shows the other party is engaged in the discussion and not just bashing and trolling. I give long answers too in general haha
Maybe we should take a step back and look at a couple things relating to Jaxx. For one, Jaxx is a small team right now. We've only started growing intensively about 2 months ago along with the industry boom. On some aspects we have been overwhelmed, but we have been coping quite nicely. Two months ago it was a team of about 7. Now we're about 20 and still growing aggressively. The support team alone has tripled in the past month. That has allowed us to achieve this:  in a crypto world where others are responding to support tickets in weeks, if only.
That has also allowed us to be more active with the community, such as responding to Redditers, and listening to the Voice of the Users more while also saying what's on our mind transparently.
Second, Jaxx is in early stage development. In the past 2 months alone we have pushed I think close to 14 updates. This shows an active development to fix and improve Jaxx. Having the multi-currency aspect and the 8 platforms is adding a lot of pressure on the devs too and also a lot of break points. Top that with Apple reviewing for our latest update (containing addition of new tokens) for 2.5 months now. These are some of the challenges we go through and Jaxx is a long way until it becomes a fully mainstream product. Trust me when I say that we are holding back a lot of marketing initiatives and internationalization because we want a product that can deliver with an infrastructure that can support it. Jaxx is currently in development. Heavy development. This is why the PR initiatives are almost absent. We want Jaxx to grow when we have checked a few to dos on the list, infrastructure being one of the main focuses at the moment to provide a reliable experience. Android Jaxx has grown from 20k downloads in April to 75k in May and to 100k right now. We consider that too much, too early.
Thirdly, the plans we have for Jaxx are absolutely fantastic. And they won't pertain only to a software wallet or just to crypto tokens. We will leverage the blockchain technologies for truly amazing thinks. But this right now is just the beginning. 
I'm sorry if sometimes we come off as hard, but some things need to be said in a direct manner. I think many things have improved in the past months including transparency and community engagement and things are continuously progressing.
To finish up _my block of text_:


The link I mentioned was from our public blog, written by Anthony our CEO&amp;Founder, and reviews the entire situation, very transparently.


Based on my understanding he controls the Monero core code on Github (bmerging) and the situation is the following:








All of this ^, coupled with all the other challenges we had back them in terms of manpower lead to the decision to no continue investing into it until some of the integration details are more convenient for us too. Over 400 hours of dev work have been invested in it back then.
Thanks again for your feedback. It's always appreciated and duly noted.

I'm not sure if there is a confusion being propagated here. What seed leak issue?
If your device is secure there isn't any security issue. If your device is breached, then everything is exposed not just Jaxx.

I don't want to start an argument but please look into this more too and I'd appreciate it if you won't generalize it and spread misinformation.
Bottom line remains that you need to be diligent and make sure your device is safe. Protect it with strong passwords, encryption, safe surfing, virus protection etc. Also the point mentioned there does not apply at all on smartphones that have the apps sandboxed (except for the ones modified by the user - rooted and jailbreaked).

Jaxx will support Bitcoin Cash. If you have your Bitcoin (BTC) in Jaxx at the time of the fork, when we add Bitcoin Cash in the wallet you will get that amount of Bitcoin Cash and be able to transact it.
You have access to your Bitcoin Cash even before we actually implement it as you have direct access to your Private Keys.

Hi there, I just sent you a DM for the ticket number so I can have a look over your ticket and help. I doubt the ticket answers were automated except for the initial confirmation one that the ticket was created.
Once I have all your information from the ticket I'd be able to assist more with this.
Ofc, you can always import your 12 word Backup Phrase in any other wallet that supports BIP39 seeds and transact from there, you're never stuck in Jaxx.

I understand how you're feeling over this, I just wanted to understand what was the issue as it's not always the actual app.

if the TX was sent from the BTC address there should be a trace of it in the TX History. Get that TX ID and e-mail support through: 
There are also some known issues with ETC and are being worked on. ETC Wallets in Jaxx (only) will not load or show balance correctly atm.

Appreciate your feedback but there was no hack of the Jaxx Wallet per se. The Jaxx Classic wallet data was always stored as encrypted on the computer. If someone has access to your computer, they have access to all your data.
With Jaxx Liberty things are different as when you set a Password, that password is used to encrypt the wallet seed thus making it very secure even if unintended parties get access to your data.
