Buying Bitcoin for the first time sometime this week. I plan to hold it for a long time. Is this how it's done?
1. Create and verify accounts with Coinbase and GDAX.
2. Buy on Coinbase, transfer to GDAX, then transfer to a hardware wallet for maximum security. I'll be using a Ledger Nano S.
3. HODL
4. When I want to sell, transfer it back to GDAX, and sell there for lower fees.
My only question is when I sell on GDAX, will it put USD in my coinbase account, and I can transfer it to my bank from there?

Literally do nothing is always the best option. This has happened many times before. Thank you OP for the reminder that this is nothing compared to what's happened.

Okay. I plan on putting in a couple thousand now and like a hundred a month. Definitely not my life savings or anything crazy. 
So really the only way your Electrum can be hacked is if you're a complete moron when it comes to cyber security? 
Edit: Also, is it possible to move your bitcoin from Electrum to a hardware wallet like a Ledger?

But it's gone from like 450 to 2100 in 3 months... went up 250 today alone...

This rise.

My phone is more likely to be lost/stolen than my PC, so I would lean towards Electrum. My only concern is someone hacking Electrum or not being able to access my bitcoin for whatever reason.

Alright sounds good. Thanks!

So I would buy a hardware wallet, then use Coinbase or GDAX or something to buy  the bitcoin, store it on the wallet, and just hide it somewhere in my house?
