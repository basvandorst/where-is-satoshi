[Goldman Sachs lost $1.9 Billion in the last 3 months, since Bitcoin value surge high as $10.000 or more! Goldman Sachs repetedly warned about "Bitcoin Bouble" because they loosing on Bitcoin rise! LOL! The end of the ruling of the top 1%!](

Let me repeat in a longer version: 
..by the way, ***NO ONE CAN CONTROL OR REGULATE BITCOIN*** governments only can regulate the exchanges but ***they can't regulate trading between people*** the news coming out of South Korea which demanding real names on online wallets are just as disgusting as it's sounds since everyone can download a full Bitcoin wallet like [ELECTRUM]( and use to store securely Bitcoin without names or any kind of control or regulation! If you use Electrum with [Tor]( than your activity on Blockchain will be fully anonymous! ***Whatever the corporate madia and the top 1% says you MUST ignore them since if you do and Bitcoin price rises the top 1% will loose billions and billions!*** Every singe Bitcoin owner must work together as one community to ***send a clear message to the top 1%!***
In the other hand I personally don't own not even a portion of any ALTCOIN since the "creators" of this coins are discrediting Satoshi Nakamoto and instead of focusing to bring down the current financial system, mots of this copy &amp; paste script kiddies will fall. No other altcoin can overcome Bitcoin, just to say something other about altcoins... they created to divide the Bitcoin community since more easy to control a small group than a large. ***In fact Ripple was developed by a cryptographer who working for the United States National Security Agency (NSA)!*** Who exchange they Bitcoins for some government created and centralized token those poeple are incredibly stupid as f*ck! ***This is the time to say good bye to altcoins and with it to regulators and speculative Wall St monkeys!***
***Those who complaining about high fees, they don't complain about the price of the Bitcoin!*** Speculative figures want to cash out 10.000 USD with just paying 20 USD for fees which in my opinion unacceptable! Everyone must pay the fees accordingly they earning! Lastly the corporate U.S media CNBC, Bloomberg, FOX, CNN and all other ***corporations*** creating fear amongs people just as they did in the past few years in the middle of the refugee crisis! They said refugees are terrorists! Now they say Bitcoin owners are terrorists! Well, well far as I see the cryptocurrency community moved more for speculative mission from RISE UP AGAINST THE CORRUPT FINANCIAL SYSTEM, BANKS, WALL ST and facist governments who control EU and United States! Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin to fight the top 1%! Of course some Jewish ***scriptkiddies*** jumped on the option and now pretending that they invented something while they only copy paste and change a few lines in the work of Satoshi Nakamoto. Obviously, those who listen to governments and Goldman Sachs or any other corporate media... will loose everything since if you exchanged your Bitcoin from that there in no back at all! A few weeks ago do you remember how the media pushed for Ripple? Stupid people sold they Bitcoins for that shit! 
***Time to wake up! Don't you think?***

***No they dont!*** Do you have any idea how Bitcoin is mined? ***Logically, if they start buying up the supply the price of one coin can rise to billions of USD!*** I own one single Bitcoin and I will be the last man in the world who owns the last Bitcoin and I will not sell them never ever. Can you imagine how much money will worth one Bitcoin after they buyed up 60% of the supply? ***Well over billions of USD!***
