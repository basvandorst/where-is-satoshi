You really think its indoctrination and conditioning? Other than the point where someone must work for wealth to be created in the first place (which is true) there will almost always be a very small % of people who own an extremely large amount of wealth due to the way capital works, in some cases those people don't even work for their money anymore (or never did -&gt; inheritance) while still having an income due to the ownership of such capital. Due to this the democracy voting will always have a left-wing pressure, its not some sort of conspiracy, the inequality struggle has existed forever. This is ignoring other complexities such as some markets not working too well when there is a lack of competition. Sometimes such lack of competition has been created by a government implementing terrible policies such as complete privatization of services in markets which tend to monopolise (such as networking infrastructure). After privatization those entities need to be regulated (but sometimes don't due to corruption/influence of money in politics) to ensure price gauging does not occur and result in people earning wealth they do not deserve for the amount of work they perform at the cost of everyone else. This is a problem in many markets in the US including healthcare where patients are unable to compare costs between hospitals.

It doesn't. Any firewall can just block incoming traffic (unless explicit told so) allowing for same protection as before (IPv6 firewalls default to this). NAT had made it so it must specifically route traffic to a local IP (same protection as explicitly allowing incoming traffic for that device).

If on windows use adblock plus everywhere (alot of malware comes through flyby ads), never visiting sites you aren't familiar with/never visited before (use bait computer/VM first), keeping everything updated (including all installed programs), install anti-virus (it wont stop a large sum of malware still obviously), make sure you have windows firewall/something similar (inbound listening protection) to prevent your computer accepting unwanted connections from the internet (if uPnP on router is enabled)/LAN and don't allow to load email content if your unaware of who its from.
If all that is to hard then either use Linux/Virtual machines/something like sandboxie.

If you had a device which could solve bitcoin's math problem using SHA256 quicker than anyone else every 10 minutes, you indeed would control the network without breaking any protocol rules.
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:49:32
For transactions less than a certain value (micropayments - ~$40 or less) you should not be expected to wait for any confirmations if you pay a high enough fee and there is a historical trend of such fee resulting in the transaction being confirmed in the next block.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:02:13
Its not hard to understand what UASF is, there is also no need for it to be sufficiently reviewed. Without enough miner hashpower an UASF will result in a chain split.
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:36:36
You could double spend, you could make no transactions confirm, you could undo transactions in the recent past. All of these "exploits" are allowed under current protocol rules and all nodes would accept it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:54:56
The only rule which is breaking "consensus" with the pre-existing network and older nodes is the blocksize *using* emergent consensus. I'm not sure what else there is? It does work slightly different in the P2P protocol (Xthin) otherwise no difference afaik.
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:46:06


Have proof that Jihan Wu has more than 50% hashrate?
Also your missing the point. SegWit increases the blocksize once which means more soft-forks/hard-forks would be needed in the future. BU is one fork of one parameter, Jihan is not going to somehow get everyone to support changing inflation rules.
BU is the third iteration of the bigger-block idea that gained traction. If BU had another serious bug, or even a remote execution vulnerability, the idea behind it would not die, only the client. It would only delay the inevitable hard-fork regarding the block size parameter, possibly when fees are $3+ each even IF segwit became activated (users would bleed into other altcoins and be more prominent to support bigger blocks).

Comment is out of context in regards to what I actually said. As the blog states Lightning needs Segwit to work as best as it can. Go back to what you do best which is creating division in the bitcoin community... I'm sure you have a lot of work ahead of you in the coming years when people realize the bitcoin protocol has stagnated due to the division you helped facilitate. 95% is a very high target to reach and it won't happen with miners like ViaBTC around, that's the reality and I am sure it will reach home to you eventually.
@_date: 2017-01-16 07:09:55
The hashrate has jumped quite a bit lately, blocks are being produced faster than every 10 minutes so next difficulty adjustment will should cause the average block size to increase even more.
It makes much more sense to argue based around statistics, rather than picking at the current block height.  visualizes where we are easily, the average block size can never fully reach full 1MB, outliers will distort it.
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:14:12
@_date: 2017-01-09 13:33:10
Sigh.. here we go


I wasn't talking about CPU voting? More rather about people thinking the bitcoin can't handle a higher transaction rate at this time.


Node count has not decreased in the last year according to   


If you want to talk about economics, a artificially created fee market distorts supply and demand, so much so demand needs to decreased due to a fixed supply (transaction rate), this is fact and cannot be disputed (see what quota means under economics). The number of nodes is not really related to economics.


Ignoring the price of that drive, the technology is there, I have seen SSD prices slashed year after year and will continue to do so. This technology has the capability to scale in three dimensions, unlike HDD's.


I'm not sure why you think the health of the network is disproportionate to the amount of commercial use. It would be much more obvious to state that the network would have more nodes if it we're widely/commercially used? If 1000 more people used bitcoin, but of those 1000 people only 5 hosted nodes that's still an increase in decentralization.


Commercial outfits are real people, its not some sort of conspiracy. Small businesses we're set to benefit from bitcoin, not anymore. Anyway, if businesses were transacting in bitcoin do you think they would want to attack the network they profit from?


The internet already operates like that on a large scale. In the end the thing that really defines bitcoin is its whitepaper. The top of the paper states: P2P money, not P2P wealth storage or "digital gold".


History? Have forgot how computing has evolved in just 20 years? People might think CPU's are at their limit, however if you think in terms of economies of scale this gives competitors time to catch up and produce cheaper CPUs. All these companies are still spending billions on R &amp; D. Its also possible consumer motherboards will have two CPU sockets in the future.
If you were talking about historical node data, well then there is also not enough data available to attribute a larger transaction rate = less nodes when its just as likely to conclude that node count won't decrease at all (or slower than you think) due to increased adoption.


It IS healthy to openly discuss these things, how do you think democracies work?

@_date: 2017-01-09 05:11:00

The single biggest thing that influences miners decision is profits. BCH is only profitable to mine because people buy the coin, otherwise the price would drop and so would profitability.
@_date: 2017-01-16 06:34:25
Every time a non-full block is mined fees are pushed up. Also it makes no sense to link to just one miners decision to not mine a full block.

I think you missed the point. There is no way the current network could overtake the current financial system due to the amount of processing required in its current state between all nodes to do so. Most PC's could not support processing and verifying the amount of transactions PayPal does. I thought that was a given. Getting bitcoin that widespread would include government involvement whether they directly or indirectly host the nodes, that's the reality. I am not arguing against a smaller government in terms of other policies.
Also being realistic, banks could still provide many services even if bitcoin was the primary currency.
@_date: 2017-01-27 09:14:30

@_date: 2016-12-19 10:05:16
I too think bitcoin will do fine in its current form. But will it reach widespread adoption? (99% of the world economy like you mentioned) is another argument, basically impossible right now. That's not an opinion, its fact unless quantum computers increase processing power by an insane amount for certain transaction verification processes and global network speeds increase thousands fold.
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:30:27
@_date: 2016-12-19 10:15:43
The problem I nominate being economic volatility and inflation? (no store of value). I think bitcoin could combat both those, inflation for obvious reasons, volatility for reasons being the ability for cheap credit to create bubbles &amp; distort true value of markets.
Greece is an economy that needs to default on its debts and begin a proper recovery. Fiat money allows it to drag on in pain, there are pressures not to default due to the instability of the Euro. A similar analogy can be applied to many economies. It's why negative interest rates and quantitative easing have started to become to prominent.
@_date: 2016-12-19 10:58:37
When did I say bitcoin wouldn't do fine with quantum computers? I was saying *it could be* the key to keeping our current levels of decentralization while increasing transaction though-put of the network.
Anyway maybe its better to ask a question rather than repeating myself. If even 1% of the global economy moved onto using bitcoin today in its current what do you think would happen?
@_date: 2019-08-23 00:32:57

You're forgetting the median fee is now an all time high of $0.18. Transaction rate/demand was forced to reduce as the fee kept increasing. Unconfirmed TX's decreasing is a side effect of the current fee market which in economical terms has a quota applied to it (the consumer looses - its a form of market manipulation). This isn't FUD its basic economics and can be seen on a supply/demand curve with S (supply) moving to the left while Q (quantity) decreases and P (price) increases.
Fees might drop of a bit now, but I except it to continue its increasing trend as demand continually tries to move to its free-market equilibrium (increase in Quantity) which it cannot reach.
@_date: 2016-10-17 03:14:28
The problem is that the concept of "hard-forking" (breaking-change) means that it is inevitable for most software, including bitcoin. It would be easier to remove the stigma behind hard-forking like Ethereum has done without problems. How else do we expect to get other on-scaling changes implemented that require a hard-fork. If Core was more open towards hard-forks they wouldn't become disillusioned by so many. By the way I was talking about the Bilderberg Group in regards to funding.
@_date: 2016-10-14 14:09:18
Correction: All miners agree on the same rules/protocol. That still stands true with Core, BU and Classic as they all run on the same chain. Its implementation independent.

You mined at break-even (i.e. not at a loss)? And I am ignorant?
People mining at a loss is also not what prevents cryptocurrencies from going into miner deflationary spiral.
ETH is also a terrible example because it has REALLY fast difficulty re-adjustment periods, its basically immune to a deflationary spiral. ETH difficulty would just decrease to the right levels, usually either just above breaking point, at breaking point, or just below it.
Ask yourself, would've you made more money buying ETH out straight, or mining? People do not invest in mining equipment for a projected loss outside hobbyists. If an individual thinks the price will rise in the future they will just by coin.
What you should've said is miners at a loss due to them already having the capital to mine in the first place (and selling it at that time would may result in an increased or realized net loss).
Also your forgetting that improvements in technology (ASIC or otherwise) allows hashrate of all cryptocurrencies to continue growing independent of the price.

Proof-of-work is proof-of-work no matter where it comes from. Your suggesting chinese miners are malicious, well dishonest miners with large % of hashrate can control any PoW coin without breaking consensus rules, even the UASF chain. I understand the point of view that an "economic majority" can sway profit-seeking miners into the chain of their choice, this assumes miners are still profit seeking. Never downplay the importance that mining plays in solving Byzantine Generals' problem otherwise your giving people misinformation on how bitcoin works. You can't censor or "isolate" proof-of-work.
"The power of nodes" itself doesn't mean anything, economic energy does, which means UASF users need to immediately dump their non-UASF coins to have any "power". Note that this requires exchange support to provide liquidity.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:36:04
Who is "they"? The only blockchain you can trust is the one you validate yourself. Nodes are useful for personal trustlessness, not for telling other nodes or miners which coins are within the ledger, something which must be proven by accumulative PoW since the genesis block.
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:13:14
Still didn't get my point, nodes themselves have no power that can influence the decision of other nodes or miners (unlike PoW, which can undo transactions). Stick to the terms "economic majority" determining the rules/consensus not "nodes", because at-least that makes more sense.
