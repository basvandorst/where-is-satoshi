If you call privacy “FUD” then you need to rethink the all terms you pick up off the Internet. I don’t need people like you and BoA may be good to others but this is just my personal situation.

I’m looking into those now considering the feedback I have gotten.

I know, it’s just a hassle and if someone else less fortunate was in my situation without a debit card or bank account for 2 weeks it would be a lot different.

I’m what most would call an earlier investor (not like people who invested money at $10 etc...) and did work a job for $50,000 worth of bitcoin at the time in 2016. I’ve paid all my taxes on my gains and withdraws since then. This is just ridiculous how they treat people like me.

I’ve only used my personal account which was linked to my mothers (to transfer money to pay for the house and other living expenses) to deposit money into my account from the bitcoin I’ve sold through Coinbase. I’ve never once made a purchase of bitcoin through my bank or acted as an MSB.

That is not a reason to terminate my 4-5 year account and my mothers 15-20 year account only because she was linked to me.

I’m sorry, I don’t take jokes at face value when it’s a real problem.

Wells Fargo is another bank though unless I don’t understand, a lot of people say credit unions are better for bitcoin users like myself.

I made a few $10,000 deposits from Coinbase before they raised my limits automatically to $100,000. So I made a few (3-4) $50,000+ but less than $100,000 deposits.
