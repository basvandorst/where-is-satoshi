I'm so confused on how these taxes work. Does it get pulled against my income bracket; or is it 15% capital gains and that's it?

Why the fuck would you post about this on Reddit? Delete this. Idiot.

Cool - and you're mentioning banks here; if you're selling but going into the Coinbase USD wallet rather than withdrawing immediately; is it instant?
Edit: Instant less confirmations

Been going down steadily...

Why are you in this subreddit if you don't believe in Bitcoin? The entire purpose is for it not to have a connection to fiat currencies. Yeah - every currency is "connected" in the sense of the global economy; but BTC is not pegged to any one currency. If the USD tanked; BTC would still hold value - just like any other currency would still hold value. Yeah - it would be affected, as would all of those, but they'd hold the majority of their value.

On the contrary - if our dollar started tanking, I'd probably buy more bitcoin. It would protect my value.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:46:12
Yes - but if someone wants to buy, and they're only going to pay $50/bch then the price will drop when someone agrees to sell it for that amount.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:33:05
Why would it, though? BTC has no peg to the USD.

Eh - this is a *huge* jump this year. I bought in last time this happened; and then there was a crash and I basically forgot about Bitcoin until the beginning of this year.
Would not be surprised at all if we eventually crash and settled in at $6k or something.
Not saying it'll happen; not saying it'll happen soon; and I'm definitely bullish on BTC in the long haul and will continue to hold - but I think it'll crash; just has the same feeling as last time in '13-'14ish.

Sign-up for an exchange; buy a portion of BTC worth $133. Either set a calendar event to do this every month yourself or see if an exchange has a way to do it automatically.

The easiest route is to buy via an exchange (CoinBase) - in that case, the coins are then stored *on* CoinBase.
This is not recommended as there have been issues with exchanges in the past; however this is fine for if you have a small investment or just in the short-term while you figure things out.
If you'd like to move to keeping your own coins, you can then create a software wallet - or buy a hardware wallet (Such as Trezor) and transfer your coins to your possession.

I said that years ago when I bought at like $800; shot up to $1.5k then crashed to $300 (Ball-park numbers). Wasn't going to sell at a loss so just held and basically just ignored the fact that I owned at all. Came back this year - and hey look, that paid off.
Moral of the story: HODL!

It voids warranty on our Android phones...

The price has been inflated for months. Check the historical trend over the past decade, you see it sky rocket - and then drops, and then cruises down to a more believable amount. Every, damn, time.
The big drop was from 20k down to the running 13-14k we've had. I think it stayed at 13-14 for so long due to extra publicity compared to the previous. And now we'll see it slowly decline over the next few months to a more healthy average. Might go back up still - but I personally think it'll keep going down a bit more, 8k high I think.
But I'm just some dude on the internet :-)

BTC stayed the same after BCH went up to $700 (And then leveled to ~$400). There are similarities; but you can't compare cryptocurrencies 1-1 to anything else in the traditional market.

Pretty sure your warranty is voided the second you unlock your bootloader.
And FYI - I've been an Android user, and still am, since Gingerbread - And regularly root all my devices.

Huh, didn't know Richard Branson was knighted.

"Any" learning course? That's a pretty blanket statement there. All for saying fuck Tai Lopez; but there's plenty of great genuine paid content out there from other producers.

Hm - Interesting, I transferred out of CB and had my first confirmation within 10 mins. Just woke up now and checked and I have over 50. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:31:08
When you say "wait" - what do you mean?
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:44:45
I'm sure they're sending and cashing out in the same day.
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:29:38
Wait - am I looking at the wrong thing? I transferred a few bucks and had confirmations within the hour. Just moved the rest of my BTC and figured it'd go all swell?
I'm kind of new to the non-online wallet thing; been meaning to move for a while, but never had any problems with CB so was just hanging on. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:38:31
You act as if it's fluctuating wildly every day. For the most part it's stable - and we have some wild hiccup every 4 months.

Do.. Do you not see the photos?

Me at 3000: "Weeeeeeeeeeee - Now we wait for the crash!"
Me waking up to 2300: "Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee"

Yeah... comment wasn't enough...
Wat?
