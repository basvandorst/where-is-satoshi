This will open doors to regulation. Not sure if thats good or bad. Probably a bit of both.

Has nothing to do with save. I would say the majority that are coming in the past month or so, see crypto as a way to get rich quick.

Skins vs Cowboys will be on. Not gonna watch.

Its going take a bigger dip sometime between now and Monday. That was just a little scare to the newbs. The real test will come in the next couple of days. Im expecting it to go back down between $7500-8k

Honestly, it feels like thats what is going on right now. They are dropping the price to buy bitcoin cheap to sell for their Bitcoin Futures. No way they are going to buy a coin at $9k to sell for $10k. More likely they want that price down to around $5k or even less.

Same thing happened to me. I deposited on 11/24. My bank shows the WD on 11/27. Its still not showing in Coinbase. I emailed them and have not heard back. 
I also made a sale yesterday and my account has not been credited.

This will prob change soon. Not necessarilly with CSchwab but Finance Companies like this will be in the market in 2018. Coinbase cant compete with them.

Yes, institutions are going to crash it so they can buy it cheap to sell futures. Im interested to see what happens after Dec 11th, the day that the first Bitcoin future is offered by big time trading company.

Its easy to Hodl right now because most people are still ahead. But if Bitcoin drops down to sub $1k, I want to see how many people still preach Hodl.

Snail Mail or Carrier Pigeon. They are bogged down with email.
