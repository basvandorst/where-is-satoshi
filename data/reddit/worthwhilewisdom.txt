In [this video]( Andreas Antonopoulos says that the bitcoin protocol can be 're-worked' in the event of what could be considered as an outside attack on the bitcoin blockchain
This is confirmed in the [bitcoin.org FAQ]( as they state that the protocol can be changed, but there will need to be a complete consensus among bitcoin users. 
My questions: 
Firstly in the video, Andreas mentions an alternative blockchain might be created if they had to re-work the protocol to protect the network. Would bitcoin only work if everyone (every single user) was using the same blockchain? What would happen if there were two blockchains where there is support for each- is it at all reconcilable? 
Secondly, is there any time where the protocol can be 're-worked' to the advantage of the minority that can do this? As said in the FAQ they cannot force a change because "all users are free to choose what software and version they use", is this the safegaurd against it? Is it that it is open source? Is it related to the 1st question in that there has to be only 1 blockchain?

What is your point?

It would be useful to yourself and others who would use that to add a box that shows the profit as a percentage of your initial investment (a.k.a. your return on investment).

Do you mind explaining how you've come up with that split?

I think this is true for a lot of people buying in now because they've seen the increase in price and how lucrative it can be if you trade it right. 


Yeah and I think it is a legitimate one. As it is now, businesses that do accept bitcoin as payment seem to be immediately exchanging it for its monetary value right there and then so it's almost just an online payment processing tool.

Yeah perhaps I was a bit inaccurate in my post. I've just been skimming [this webpage]( which states:


At some point though the US government is going to have to stick their flag in the ground.

So what, like laminating it?

Probably for the service they provide you of allowing you to withdraw money when/where you want if there is an atm nearby and allowing you to purchase goods online or over the phone. 
Bitcoin may be an answer to the above scenarios though.

It's anonymous in the sense that you can send bitcoins to someone without knowing anything about them except their bitcoin address.
