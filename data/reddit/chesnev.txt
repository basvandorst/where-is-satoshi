Frist of all bitcoin hit 10k just last week so this "As the price climbed up to 10k over the past several months it became bla bla" is pretty fiction.
Second, there are people who have lost bitcoin or who sold to early no doubt... suicide hmm I don't know
Third: Why would you kill yourself ..."$50M I might have killed myself too." for money? Find a hobby instead. 
Four: This seems to me like a scream for Reddit attention + an instigation to "if you've lost bitcoin in the past you should kill yourself". 
As this industry is observed by children and youngsters more and more why would you post something with a subliminal message like kill yourself in you've lost bitcoin? 
Write a diary man or go to counseling if that truly happened.

Yes I've got a "huge short", I am paid with crypto potatoes! Dude is just an analysis with comparisons and similar situations. You are entitled to your opinion. Do you have any opinions on Bitcoin?

I agree with that, but think about it...If the number of icos will continue to rise so will the demand for people. It's a good thing that this technology also creates jobs, but let's hope we don't fall in the crisis we had a few years ago when the demand for web developers was skyrocketing and there were few people who knew html or css.
