No single person or entity, and that's the best thing about Bitcoin. It truly makes it borderless and country-agnostic.

The first thing you should do is investing in an ultra-secure wallet and run your own node. You're after all worth \~$4M as of now.
The second thing you should do is deleting this post and every mention that you're in possession of such amount.
The last thing you should do is sending me a bitcoin so that I can tell everyone on this subreddit how much I'm lucky hahaha (just kidding)

I really miss the time when Bitcoin was just for nerds, anarchists and cypherpunks because they understood its potential when no one else did. Everything government touches end up with regulations and taxes, and this is not what Bitcoin is trying to solve. Bitcoin is borderless, stateless and has nothing to do with the current financial system. Bitcoin is the native currency of the Internet and it should remain unregulated, because it's always cool to have more freedom.

Imagine if keeping your car idling 24/7 produced solved Sudokus you could trade for heroin.
(Just kidding haha, you can find really simple explanations on Youtube)

Oh didn't know someone wrote it, I actually heard it on Youtube a while ago
@_date: 2019-10-03 02:39:47
Even better, create Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:52:46
Except Libra, it will ruin everything.
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:46:30
I mean it's 10k USD not BTC
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:27:55
Haha I'm in Europe too
@_date: 2019-10-05 02:33:57
Hahaha I was going to write that one in the README but I couldn't remember it with exactitude
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:41:31
Haha I thought about it but I wanted to start my own project :)
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:44:59
Haha thought about it but 10.000 BTC doesn't make sense
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:56:01
It wasn't my goal
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:18:58
I live in Paris, France but I think location doesn't mean anything when it comes to dev jobs in 2019, especially with cryptos/Blockchain jobs
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:57:42
Haha I agree, thanks :)
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:17:36
Thanks a lot for the answer! I'll do my best to follow your advice :)
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:42:09
What makes you think so?
@_date: 2019-01-24 17:14:48
That's a typical example of one of the biggest corporations in the world trying to takeover the crypto market. Cryptocurrencies belong to the people, and they'll never be controlled by one single entity UNLESS you make it possible by using those kinds of products.

Haha honestly I just created it for fun but I thought that doing it with a CLI can be faster and lighter, just like people prefer Vim over VSCode
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:31:02
Yes, I'm trying to integrate myself in the crypto community via Twitter and Github but unfortunately, with all the scammers and the noise out there it can get difficult
@_date: 2019-09-11 11:52:16
Exactly the comment I was going to type. Bitpay thinks BITCOIN belongs to them by doing such things
@_date: 2019-09-08 17:19:10
What? I honestly wasn't aware of that. You can check my code, it's completely different! Even the name is the same but I didn't know this existed!
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:48:39
I was mainly referring to USSR

The Tyrack Paradox
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:55:07
That's a contradiction haha
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:17:22
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:48:06
I'll DM you the friend link to be able to read it for free! :)
@_date: 2019-05-18 15:53:49
Great analysis, thanks a lot for the constructive feedback!
