Definitely that is the reason of all this shit happening in the world. That fucking pipeline triggered a lot of bad things.  
Will be interesting to see the next move of Russia in this matter.

Because are not your bitcoins  and because behind Coinbase is a bank (crooks)  
  
Why would I need that Shit card when I can use directly my bitcoin wallet. Banks are living their last days... soon will be obsolete.

Nothing will be banned, they just want to scare you to use those technologies.

Why don't let users to mine in whatever pool they want?

Are you "preparing" something and you are making a "market study" now ? Be careful the gov agents are everywhere and in special here :) Also they have to obtain information...

Bitcoin companies like this they should put (with links to reddit posts) on their blog, testimonials or news page some of these early experiences from users using their services (not fake "only wonderful" testimonials). So the new users can read about real experiences. In this way we can clean a bit the market from fake, scams, bad bitcoin companies.  
I would use a service like this even if they have bad aspects (that they notice and will fix it in future). At least i know is working, is not fake or scam. Ok is not wonderful/perfect in all aspects but is acceptable.  
Let's see which one will publish this kind of opinions: cashila, bitbill, bitwala, chip-chap, bit2me, anycoindirect, bitwage and many others.

hahaha this is awesome!
@_date: 2015-10-29 14:52:04
hahaha good point! Actually I never see mentioned a bitcoin wallet for blind people. Why nobody think about this? Will be quite difficult for them no?

How many times will see this BS promo? This device is useless in bitcoin world.

You really think that people will still deposit bitcoins into that "WeHoldYourMoney" scam? Those that already have bitcoin there will be lucky if they can withdraw them in the next weeks.

With the "forcibly increase" of fees due to "full mempools" definitely adoption will take longer. When new bitcoin users will see that for a simple coffee you will have to pay at least 5000 satoshis will not be so cool to use bitcoin...

I was doing for some years freelance jobs through upwork. But for a year or so I start asking the clients if they want to pay me in bitcoin for the work. Like 30% agreed, 20% said will think about, 50% they said is against upwork rules to make a payment outside the upwork, but some of them are really interested.  
Now I keep a close relation with those that are paying directly in bitcoin and also they prefer now to contact me directly for quick tasks etc paying in BTC. So upwork already lost some and soon will be more.  
People that use upwork should do the same: ask the clients if they want to pay with bitcoin, all the time. If they accept ok, if not, move on, do not engage in debate.  
I saw here on r/bitcoin few months ago a guy posting his web with a bitcoin counter for work for companies that contract freelancers. That tool can be integrated very easy for any type of work.

Seems "legit", 4 year club user and dare to say your story here, with no fear about trolls... Good for you man!  
BTW your videos are awesome! You catch all the "types" of bitcoiners in that video, excellent! Great sharing.  
Are you paid in bitcoins?  
EDIT: I put your videos in my favorites (I don't like to subscribe, but keep favs). Your video about bitcojn have to stay next to Andreas favorites links :)

Never install a new version in the early days of release, when the version that you already have is working just fine. Wait to see the results from others more experimented and if all ok after few weeks do it. In special when you have coins in there.  
I suggest you to have also the mycelium wallet key restored in Electrum, just in case. Works wonderful with 2 apps for the same wallet.
