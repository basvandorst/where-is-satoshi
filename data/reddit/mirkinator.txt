Your logic is flawed.  
1. You assume that everyone is holding their coins and that us altcoin miners dont sell theirs for BTC.  
2.  Most altcoins create a specific amount per block at an average time per block, all you are doing is taking coins from the dedicated miners.  Not like these coins wouldnt make it to the market anyways.
3. This will even out to bring the average price of coins *higher* because it only sells the highest price coin.  So if LTC skyrockets, the pool drops w/e other alt coin.  Now the dedicated miners on this altcoin get twice as much coins and can continue doing their nefarious purposes that you hate so much.  As long as LTC stays hi, then the other coins will continue to rise regardless.
4.  Pretty pious to think that your way is better then any other way.  You seriously cant think of *any* improvement whatsoever that could be made to bitcoins?  and you never, ever want that implemented?
5.  Your an ass

Thanks :D  Exactly what I was thinking. Lots of us miners mine alt coins for BTC, because we dont have thousands for asics.  All this will do is drop the payouts for everyone

Ah, it makes so much. Thanks! :D I suppose my error was assuming ppl would research it and start with btc from another exchange

I dont understand how this causes the price to spike on mt gox?  Can anyone explain?  To me, they should be worth less since you cant get $$ out easily and this makes less demand on them?  I realize a lot of people must have their $$ stuck on Mt gox and unable to use it any where else, thus only being able to purchase coins, but you think it would be discouraging to new customers and after these months of issues, certainly have an impact on demand by now?
