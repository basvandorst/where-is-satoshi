And that's why it's A bubble

nah, u just have to pay tax, thats ur concern, u have to minimise it somehow
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:04:21
ull have to pay tax AFAIK cause its an investment, and bitcoin is heavily regulated now in Aus. go to an accountant, and figure it out. i was mulling over this. not sure on what the right strategy is.

yeah except something can replace bitcoin, it aint gold, there are a lot of alts out there that are bitcoin but better, ur investing in data. just think about that. btc is not gold, gold has no replacement.

Who would want to buy these coins, the they are dirty, inputs to form a tx to sell will be the outputs in a new transaction on the receiver. Btc lack. Of fungibility is q huge problem. Tho it's easily washed: dirty Btc -&gt; Monero -&gt; clean Btc

They received funds in seconds? I used wu not long ago and it took a day. Is there a new option to make it Instant?
@_date: 2018-08-30 23:28:43
How long did the transfer take? 1 day?
@_date: 2019-10-21 01:35:45
Let me guess requires a custodial wallet on LN, shit
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:45:04
i see, thats interesting. we have a manipulated market, i think most people agree on. 
you can watch what whales do like what whalewatch api provides, is that something you do track whale wallets?
do you factor in teather printing into your assessment? as many believe there is a teather btc relationship i.e. tether is printed it buys btc

how did you come to the conclusion that libra / fb thing would do this as a pump. there are plenty of stablecoin projects out there. though none more public than facebook coin.

censorship is rife here have a look at this sub  you are being held back from knowing a lot of important things about bitcoin good / bad. the discourse here and the posts are very lacking. 
I'd muse most people have no idea how a bitcoin transaction even works, what unspent transaction outputs are and how fees are determined when creating a transaction.
this post is also testing censorship :)

wow, take macro econ 101 and you will realise how stupid this is. 
@_date: 2019-06-14 08:46:49
no one will use it because of the fees
testing the censorship :)

is there any downside to running a LN node? your utxo would be unusable while in the node as its essentially loaned out. no problem if you dont want to spend your bitcoin. any other downsides? computation costs resulting in electricity fees?
