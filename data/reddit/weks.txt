I understand very little about quantum stuff, but if I understand this correctly;
If the message "burts" when somebody is listening then couldn't the whole system be rendered unusable by someone always listening?

Well, it very much looks like it as hacked, or someone internally just straight up stole the coins.

I think taxation should only exist if you convert it to dollars back to your bank account. If you just keep bitcoins it should be no need to tax it.

I haven't played Minecraft for years so I can't say I've hear the term "premium" before, all I know is that I bought the code before it went beta.

That sounds... AWESOME.

Right now many only use and see Bitcoin as an investment. I'm saying if someone buys at 800$ and sells at 1,000$ that should be taxed.
If you believe in Bitcoin and hold it trough ups and downs that shouldn't be taxed.
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:54:07
How does that work for taxes?
@_date: 2014-04-21 05:37:21


Right, but isn't the reason why normal people can't mine anymore because of things like KnC increasing the difficulty?

Which was it? Debit or credit? Because debit should be infallible unless the person taking the payment is incompetent.

In this event they released a 'new "blockchain"' so the total supply went from 2,1 billion coins to... 120billion or something. With this change everyone who had OneCoins got their coins doubled and also increased the "mining" to 50,000 coins per minute or something crazy like that. All this without any inflation the price naturally.

It's a fairly well known effect in huge scams, the ones being scammed cannot accept that they have been scammed and that they have lost a lot of money. They become almost like zombies or something; believing everything, questioning nothing, shutting their ears to anyone trying to tell them the truth.
@_date: 2015-11-30 08:22:21
I really wounder if we will ever see such a price again.

I, thankfully, don't have family in this but some friends that are just as bad. Good luck.

So is the hard fork succeeding in Etherum a major development or will it be removed if I post it?
@_date: 2016-07-19 09:55:09
Hello, I've followed OneCoin for quite some time. It's most certainly a scam, unfortunately, in good old scam mentality, I've found it almost impossible to prove to anyone that has heavily invested in to this that it is a scam. In fact the more they have invested, less likely they are to listen to reason.
@_date: 2016-07-23 05:35:45
Just a thought but... maybe every altcoin isn't a ponzi?

The Forbes article doesn't mention Bitcoin even ONCE.
Yet you are saying it's more relevant to than a article that mentions Bitcoin 13 times.
@_date: 2016-07-22 05:24:00
What  you say is nice, but still I wouldn't feel safe (as in I would fear getting banned) for posting this:  for example.
@_date: 2016-07-25 19:21:24
Hey Tim! Good to see you on reddit too, keep exposing OneCoin to the world!
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:18:37
On what do you base this prediction?
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:09:24
Transactions between individuals, even if they make it illegal, would be hard if not impossible to stop. That is true but I wasn't talking about individuals, I was talking about businesses.
Would they really risk government fines for accepting Bitcoins? Taking it further they would need to dodge taxes so they wouldn't get caught using Bitcoins in the first place, they certainly wouldn't risk that. Big bussiness get audited, often. Even small places in countries like Norway would really stick their necks out to accept Bitcoin were they made illegal, because it would circumvent the value added tax system.
Note that I'm talking about countries like Norway here, I have no idea how easy it would be to circumvent the laws in say the US.

As a fellow Nordic person I have to wonder how exactly this is taxed though.

They can stop businesses from legally accepting it.
