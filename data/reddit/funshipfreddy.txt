Does anyone know what the actual technology is behind wire transfers, or any other non-internal transfers for that matter?

You are so grossly misinformed about compound interest, saving money, and budgeting that it's hilarious. Are you still in high school? Only someone in high school would say a comment like this.

Can someone please tell me wtf burning man is?? Every article talks about vague artsy something, and every picture just shows dirty people lounging around..

No that's not true, and what you're saying is highly illegal. Your winnings and losings are tracked for comps, taxes, and stuff like that. All machines are set to pay out a certain percentage per money played no matter what.

It truly would not surprise me if banks' had to send a snail mail letter with every external wire transfer. That's probably the only logical answer to it, TBH.

I don't think you understand how retirement accounts work. We're not talking about a &lt;1% interest rate on a savings account here. In a retirement account you defer part of your paycheck which is then invested by your employer and can (usually) see a 6% return on it when you retire (6% is conservative, I'm averaging 11% right now but it all depends on the economy/market).  Without going into too much detail, the more time you have means the more time you have for interest to compound. Do a quick google search to see the difference of what compound interest can do for you in 8 years in retirement, I think you'll be surprised.  
    
OP only making $80k over 30 years says to me he did not have a well funded investment account and was stashing money in a savings account. That money was not "working for him" and he was not earning jack in interest. I'm a recent college graduate only saving 6% and I'm already over $10k, and its been 2.5 years.

I'm just trying to figure out why it is so slow. It seems like it's not the technology per se, but more or less all the regulations that are a part of it. Bitcoin aside, I find it hard to believe that in 2014 it still takes banks 3+ days to transfer money from one account to another.

I'm so confused now. Whatever, I guess I did misread the thread or only got half the story. $85k by 30 is excessive. Not impossible, but difficult.

Go read some of the uber drivers forums online, or even the uber reddit. There sure is an expectation to tip by many uber drivers. I've even read a bunch of drivers saying that they won't rate someone higher than 4 stars if they don't tip, no matter what. Ridiculous.

Maserati did a fantastic job diluting the brand with Ghibli.

The company I used to work for paid this ransom twice. I was asked both times to send Bitcoin to the IT guys and be reimbursed in cash through the finance department.
