Give me a kiss. Your lips are worth more than bitcoin

Bitcoin is stupid in the first place. Why would anyone buy something they immediately lose money on due to fees? Besides people like me who are mentally ill and don't care.
Hmm let's see. Pay $1000 and receive $960 of funny money? Sure why not!

I only have 7 months to live. I'm trying to make the biggest return I can get in the shortest amount of time.

No idea. It makes no sense. Money makes no sense. I hate money I want to die

I didn't mean to buy bitcoin. I meant to actually buy USD for the wallet. I didn't realize my mistake until after, the site is not clear.
I'm basically forced to hold for 7 days and I have a good feeling it'll be worth $1500 by the time I get it. The hype of august 1st is over, bitcoin has no more Steam

No, just unlucky invester. Was trying to get back into crypto after BTC-e fucked me.

Why would anyone care about being banned by coinbase when there's dozens of other sites that do the exact same thing?
