You're talking about a big correction rather that a big bang.  I hope you're right.

I'm no guru and I think you're close to the mark.  IF!!!! there is a bubble pop things will crash down much further than they should, then bounce back quickly.  At the moment there is a spring with no damping.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:17:23
That makes me more nervous.  Do you seriously think that?
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:50:07
I'll be honest; I've seen ups and downs over the past year.  I don't have a huge investment but I now have enough to get a top end S-Class.
I am nervous about the medium term future so I am seriously thinking about bailing and just enjoying my gains rather that worrying about ifs and buts.

I started reading this and was thinking you were going to try to convince me to HODL.  A BMW wouldn't be the worse thing in the world ;)
I will try them both as a cash buyer but for now I see myself as a Merc driver (perhaps because I'm hitting 50).
If I was more confident with BTC I could go for a Bentley, but I'm not and I've always wanted a kick ass Merc.

Replace "who don't use..." with "... internet" and you can join the dotcom club.
Bitcoin will be massive in the future but it has outgrown it's pants right now.

There is a way, but I'm not telling you.
OK - I will; get a QR code tattooed on your ass by a miner for $200 then charge $10 a day. Job done!!!!

I have thought about the environmental implications of BTC mining and if it is an ethical investment.  Then I think it's not the power that's used, it's how it's generated that really matters.  Then I think about my Lambo and fuck it all!
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:57:06
You don't need a broker and, for the time being, no broker can touch the golden goose.  Why do think it's not all fucked yet?

I've left my crystal ball at home but I'll check it later.

Chinese shills cashing in their paychecks?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:22:12
Nope, it's bollocks.
You're really scrapping the barrel now for shit to post.  Has your shitpost rate dropped?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:20:17
It take around 5 business days, you only need to send £6 or so.  Get you account verified now for when you need/want to cash out.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:01:35
See; in profit already.  Would have to be diet Fantas though, don't want to over do it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:07:58
By hoops do you mean id verification?  If so then that's what you need to do unless you fancy selling them in dark car parks at night.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:47:21
Point 1: Don't find a broker.
Point 2: Who the fuck knows.

This sounds like the way to do it, however you'd need to be careful with security.  You'd probably need a separate, secure wi-fi network for the tablet(s) or you may end up giving away free food...
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:30:34
I'm assuming that you have public wi-fi in your restaurant that customers can use.  I wouldn't use that network for your tablets simply because it's a security risk you don't need.  Personally I wouldn't use a public access point for accessing anything that I had to keep secure.
I may be wearing a tinfoil hat but it's comfortable; hopefully an IT expert can quantify the risks.  When I've paid using BTC I've switched to 4G.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:40:47
I could have got you some for $3000, you were over charged!
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:05:03
Wait, what?  Are you saying I can buy with no cash balance on credit?  I've always transferred money then bought with my deposited cash when the time was right.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:15:07
It's pretty easy; just try to guess the market and day trade - you'll fuck it up good and proper.
Have a proper look around and read about cryptos.  Things look good now but it's not always been so rosy.  In most cases when popular money piles in it's time for the smart money to get out.  Bitcoin may be the exception or it may be just another wealth hover.  Your decision.
If you want some go to Coinbase and buy, but make sure you do so with both eyes open.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:53:36
That may be true but the level of retarded bollocks over there is funny (for a little while).  Have a quick look then have a shower!
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:47:45
The exchange rate is pretty close to what you could buy it for so whatever is easiest for you.  Bear in mind that if you post your stuff to them you'll lose a bit if BCT rises as you won't get "paid" for a week or two.
I hate to think how many £1000 Xbox games I've bought over the years.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:26:55
1 BTC, that'll be £8000.  Turnaround; 7000 steak bakes please. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:11:28
All you need to do is click on Receive then let the numpty in CEX scan the QR code and you're good to go.  Just to be extra safe to this on 4G, not on their public wifi.
It's easier to hack an online wallet than an offline one and there's no comeback at all; that's why people say not to keep it online.  You may as well set up an offline wallet just for the experience; a hardware wallet would cost you £100 so not worth it at this stage.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:43:47
10% have more?
This is wallets so you need to use your imagination on how many wallets individuals have.

I've got my milk and cookies ready.  Tell me another story please.
