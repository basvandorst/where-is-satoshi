Sorry, English is not my first language, so I’m not sure what’s your point. 
I share the information I have, i don’t say __any__ exchange uses this scammy technique, i am saying about which I know. I have seen much scam in my life and I am sure that’s not impossible. Also, that would be much profitable, to there is no reason to deny such possibility.
My context is that I am located in Moscow and we have this ads everywhere through internet about how you can make $1000 a day trading options and futures. None of these seem legitimate at all.
I am not stating anything with 100% surety. I don’t need to prove that Forex trading is scam to keep myself away from it.

That does not matter, fee does not depend on the order. Why he sent the rest to himself is because of the concept of Change addresses. Basically, in Bitcoin, you can only spend the whole balance at once, but you can send it to different places. So you send 0.0001 BTC to whatever you wish and then the rest to your another address.
P.S. Actually, it's a bit more complex: not the whole balance, but the whole utxo. You can have one or you can have many utxos on your account. UTXO = Unspent transaction output.

If we are talking about front-running, that’s illegal, I believe, because it’s asymmetric information, similar to insider trading. The risks are taken, but this one is imposed without any probability, it’s just 100% risk exposure. That’s not the same as risk. 
Front-running again is when you take advantage from knowing which orders will come to exchange before they are available to the public

There are two reasons it’s advised to avoid that:
- first is yes, that’s gambling: you cannot predict small movements and you always run out of deposit when a movement is big (because of the swings).
- and second is that often these sites that give you x100 leverage will draw a price graph for you specifically, provoking you into special type of bets and then making up the price so it looks like you lost money. Sauce: have a friend who worked for such exchange.
I know that’s not my deal, just wanted to share my thoughts.

I understand your bitterness, but you can’t deny vaccine when you hate the plague.
There are different things which sometimes they look the same, but one of them works and another don’t. Again, we should be open and only let the real life decide. 
I won’t vote if they asked me to return communism to Russia. I’m not stupid. But I’d vote for they to set up an experiment in a small city. AND then I would tell if UBI is stupid or not. Only given enough statistics and real dollars win.
All in all, what do you think of solutions to the possible problem where 90% are unemployed due to AI taking their jobs? Do they all become painters? Ironically, that right now happens in our world.
There are studies that’s show (and everyone has seen this situation in his life) how there are lots of jobs that are pointless. People are coming to work and getting paid for browsing internet. Often they produce low value and can be replaced by one professional who would be paid less than them in total. But that’s “creating workplaces”. Is it much different from UBI?

@_date: 2018-09-10 20:39:43
I am not preaching UBI, I am preaching non-binary thinking.
Like we don't know whether it will work unless we try. And we better know if it works before we are forced into it.
For example, there is a path where we end up with billions of people left without job because everything's automatized. Capitalism does not have an answer to that (neither communism has, of course).
So right now we should be very open to any new idea, especially the most bizarre, as only the real test could show who's right or wrong. Free market, free speech, free will.

Well, try doing nothing for a week or two and that feels great. Try spending a year without any business at all and you’d gone crazy. Ever been tired of a vacation?
As said, there are examples of countries where UBI already works. I am not pro-UBI, though we need to see bigger picture and don’t deny something just because we don’t yet see the way for it to work. Ironically, exact same thing could be said about Bitcoin.

My BCH tx does not confirm for a two days now.
On Bitcoin, 0.15 mBTC (15000 sat) goes through in the next block always. Even more, 1000 satoshis are also sufficient for the same tx. Soooo, BCH is not cheaper, for cheap tx definitely.
EDIT: Pretty same tx in BTC: 
EDIT2: 67 sat/byte both tx.

That’s not my article and I does not support __everything__ that he written, though I liked this idea about how money previously were given from the ones who had them, while now we have ability to print money right inside the system. 
UBI is a nice idea, especially in the context of people losing jobs to AI. That’s not even tomorrow question, that’s a question of thirty years, though we can start think about this right now and see some solutions.
I think this article belongs, as it’s speculating on the future, just as Bitcoin itself is a system that could or could not work, and it’s the constant empiricism who decides whether things would be this or that way.

First, as someone already mentioned, a brain wallet should not be creating a phrase of 24 words and using as a seed (moreover, I am not sure that would work: two last words are something like a checksum, if I am right).
Brain wallet should be generating random 24 words and building a story using them to remember them.
A bit math: a bip39 wordlist has 2048 words at each place ( I don't know your guessing algorithm, but even if you go through a pattern like noun-verb-noun-verb..., that's still 1024 words for each place. For a 24-word wallet that would be 1024^24 = (2^10)^24 = 2^240 = 240 bits. 
7 billion people on Earth makes around 2^33 wallets, even if anyone has 1 million wallets, that would be 2^33 * 2^20 = 2^53 wallets.
This leaves you still to guess at least 240 - 53 bits, say 190 bits for brevity.
Even if every person in the world started guessing for one phrase per second, you still need 2^160 seconds to guess for at least ONE wallet!
One year has around 2^25 seconds. This leaves us at 2^135 years. See how much we have moved, and we are still only at half the way (from 240 bits)!
Now let's say everyone has a very powerful smartphone and can go through hashes at the speed of the top bitcoin miner, 18000GH/s = 2^44 Hashes / second (Ebit E10  This way we get to the 2^90 years speed.
Now, Earth age is 4.5 billion years, that's 2^32 years. Universe age is only 14 billion, 2^34 years.
Cutting everything, including all the crazy assumptions, we are still at 2^56. And that's 2^56 __universe lifetimes__.
Now let's make it a bit better for humans and use Moore's law. Let's say every 2 years you have double hashing power increase. Say today we start with 2^44 hashes per second, and every two years we double the hashing power. 
Now we have to get a bit deeper into math. We want to know in how many years we reach the speed of say 2^(125+34) hashes per year instead  of 2^(44+25) hashes. At this speed, we need only one year to guess at least one wallet. I will also multiply by two to include integrating the tail. 
2*2^(125+34) = 2^(years/2) =&gt; 80 years.
In 80 years, given we overcome the quantum barrier inside CPUs, given we continue growing doubling hashrate every two years, given everyone buys the top bitcoin miner at that time, and runs it for a full year, only then we can get to the point where one noun-verb-noun patterned wallet would be broken.
I think that's more secure than your IRA.

Is it something every lawyer report finish with?

I am not sure it's proprietary. It's agreed-upon Bitcoin protocol for merchant payments. The link to BIP tells much more about it.
There is no **exclusion**, as the spec is completely open to implementing for anyone, and there are wallets that implement it. It's like to say that the bitcoin is centralized because it only accepts blocks in "special" "Bitcoin" format.
The only drawback I see is that somehow bitcoin.org says it's deprecated:
