EFF is just another DC think tank now. They're political creatures that won't make a move outside the box for fear of losing their meal ticket and suffering the humiliation of being snickered at in the halls of Congress. 
Now that some BS government authority has farted from their mouths about Bitcoin, EFF feels safe in maybe thinking about possibly accepting them maybe possibly. 
Chickenshits like that don't deserve our bitcoins.

Don't you have to get a lobotomy to be one of those?

Then you have to work to form a buying relationship with someone you trust that also trusts you. That also takes some effort, just like mining bitcoins or selling them.
I see a lot of people complaining that bitcoins are hard to get. That's because they are hard to get. For people raised with the notion that they can just go online and order something or run down to the store to get whatever they want, Bitcoin presents a problem. Bitcoins are rarer than gold. Put some elbow grease into getting your gold while its cheap.

Those nerds are in over their heads. I'm not sure why people even use them. There are better ways to get bitcoins.

In giving up anonymity for security, how many bitcoins have you been able to buy?

So "America: Love it and Pay taxes or leave", eh? How very Spiro Agnew (circa 1969) of you.

Do they use email? Do they use http? Bitcoin is just another network protocol and the EFF are a pack of hypocritical cowards.
I donated to the EFF during the Steve Jackson days and was proud of my association with them. Now, almost 20 years later, the EFF can kiss my bitcoiner ass.

I've only bought from them. They're pros all the way. Here's their feedback thread at bitcointalk:

But you have no idea what I'm talking about either.
@_date: 2013-03-20 10:12:49
Too late. They won't get a satoshi from me.

What the hell are you talking about? I pay taxes everytime I buy something. We all do.

Not everyone with cash lives like a gangsta.


Well doggone, the government sure does spend a lot of time and money to control such a niche market, don't they?

The "E" in their name means "Elastic".

These would have been the same people that would have turned their gold into the government when ordered to do so during the Depression.
If you don't think that's you, ask yourself: would I break the law to use bitcoins? 
If the answer is no, then you're a mooing farm animal and don't actually need a currency because you're on the way to the rendering factory anyway.

Yes they can go extinct for all I care. The only reason I kick dinosaur ass on ZH so that the fencesitters might change their minds in favor of Bitcoin.
Cyprus will be a huge help to us in the long run with regard to the fencesitters. : )
@_date: 2013-03-20 06:03:13


I don't either but I do know how to get bitcoins. I told you how I do it. It's up to you to figure out your way.
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:55:15


Only one thing to do in a case like that: buy!
@_date: 2013-03-20 12:49:50
They suck because they're now part of the apparatus in DC.
@_date: 2013-03-20 14:16:23
That won't stop Bitcoin. It won't stop a lot of merchants either.
Cannabis is illegal. How's that going for the government? If they can't stop something like the weed trade in the meatspace, they certainly will never be able to get a handle on Bitcoin.

You need to get out of the office more often.


Bitcoins &gt; gold/silver &gt; fiat.

Krugman looks at the world like a central banker does, not like human beings do. Deflation is bad to a central banker because it decreases the power of the people that issue the currency: central bankers. 
Deflation in Bitcoin is good because it will increase adoption. There are no bankers issuing the currency so no one's powerbase is threatened by Bitcoin's deflation.
Strike that last thought. The power of central bankers is reduced by Bitcoin's deflation and its adoption by more people. That's a good thing.

Satoshi: "Here! Use this tool to create and manage your own wealth and keep it away from predators in the government and banking sectors."
Bitcoin user: "Gee whiz, Satoshi! Thanks! Which government agency should I consult in order to use this tool properly?"
Satoshi: *Exits*

People aren't getting their bitcoins from Bitinstant. That thread has many, many complaints that potential buyers should read before doing business with them.

25 bitcoins come into existence every 10 minutes or so, on the average.

Why do you want to leave a trail through the banking system? Use cash, go local. 
If you want to go the lazy way, your way, you leave yourself open to having your coins tracked should various regulatory agencies decide they want a piece of Bitcoin. If you think this is outside of the realm of reason, please look at Cyprus.
If you exert a little effort, you can be anonymous on the blockchain by using cash and finding someone near you.  is a good start.

This graphic is an apologist piece of shit. The Federal Reserve was created so that a tiny minority could control the entire economy of the US. 
The Fed exists for the convenience of the wealthy. They're the clients. We're the product. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 14:01:23


Correct. Taxes are extortion, not thievery. If you don't pay protection money to the government, they'll fuck up your life and throw you in jail.
Most people just give into the extortion and try to keep a little self-respect by rationalizing it as being a "good citizen".
@_date: 2013-03-20 14:07:45
You didn't make an argument. You made a decree. That's what statists do.
@_date: 2013-03-20 13:30:41
The EFF was using http when it first started. It was untested, groundbreaking technology when they were just starting up.


Their motto is: "Defending your rights in the digital world". When Bitcoin began to look "sketchy", the EFF bailed and we didn't hear ONE WORD from them about Bitcoin and our digital rights.
Send your bitcoins to them if you want. Just don't live under the illusion that they'll be there for any Bitcoin user should the Feds move against Bitcoin.

We need to stop letting money be taken from us under force of threat. If enough of us cease to cooperate with the murderous force of rape and  robbery that is the US government, they will atrophy and we can actually live a little more cooperatively in what Satoshi called "a new territory of freedom" in the place that used to be occupied by coercion. Or we can keep being good little boys and girls and do as we're told if we know what's good for us.

I hope Satoshi gets incredibly wealthy and creates an even better Bitcoin.

If you're buying just to hold, it doesn't matter when you take the jump. 
But if you're looking for short term profit, expect to either lose or make money. How's that for advice? 
@_date: 2013-03-20 21:59:20


Correct. The IRS/Treasury deposits tax returns with the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is independent of government.
There are plenty of Republicans, and Democrats, that are all about paying their taxes. They're really proud of how they jump through whatever hoop they're commanded to and call it good citizenship.
Americans are even better at heeding authority than the Germans were but not quite as good at it as the Chinese are.
@_date: 2013-03-20 14:44:06
That wasn't my point. 
In the case of cannabis, the Feds can't even enforce their own laws on the ground. Their track record for stopping anything on the net is very poor to non-existent. 
I just want to know the source of this undying faith in their abilities with regard to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-20 06:01:58
The slow collapse of fiat is driving Bitcoin. Users will either have to conform to reality or not get any bitcoins.

Deflation will help Bitcoin's adoption through the oldest and most natural human network effect we know: simple greed. People will keep flocking when they think they can make money as the currency deflates and its value continues to rise.
@_date: 2013-03-20 14:11:58
The government can't do a thing about Bitcoin except to shut down the internet. Bitcoin was created to defeat the power of the state and of central banks. It will succeed.
You need to shift your focus of faith from the power of the state to something that's going to be around in ten years.

Only by people that enjoy being uninformed and completely off-target about reality.
Krugman's legacy will always be "Alan Greenspan needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble." from 2002. The man loves bubbles created by central banks.

A block doesn't need any transactions to be created. Some blocks have only one transaction recorded: the block reward, also known as the coinbase.
