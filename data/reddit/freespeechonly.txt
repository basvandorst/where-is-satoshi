Yes, initially Gavin was of the opinion that different implementations, even those that weren't bug for bug compatible, threaten the stability of the network.  He's since changed his mind based on his analysis and experience with previous forks.  And he was wrong initially.  Your point?  Different incompatible implementations are *the standard* software engineering practice anywhere bugs are unacceptable.  You have several different implementations, and they vote.  Any disagreement triggers a failsafe or recovery procedure.  Such a Bitcoin architecture would be completely resistant to the effects of hard forks, and is what we should be (and are) working towards.
Also, a change that has 75%+ of hashpower backing and plenty of warning time is not controversial.  And no hard fork will happen without such conditions.
**EDIT** - I replied to the below comment but it was removed and I was banned from r/Bitcoin.  They left this one up so it would look as if I had no counterargument.  The reply is reproduced below:








Remove this one too you cowards.
