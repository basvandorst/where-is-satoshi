The goal is to make fun of stupid people doing stupid things. Not just humans everywhere doing human things.
The funniest part is none of you cared when the price was good, and now that it's tanking, you're going on a witch hunt. Which breeds even more hilariously stupid activity and mentality. This could be a case study for a psych PhD... or perhaps it already is? The world may never know...

No experienced developer is going to work 12-16 hour days. It's just not possible. Any productivity is going to start scaling off after the 2-3 hour mark, and by the time you hit an 8 hour workday, you're just staring at your monitor, wondering what the hell you are doing with your life.
Most of your productive hours are going to be while you are sitting at home thinking about something, and then you have an Aha! moment, and then you implement it (or try to, and then find out why it doesn't work after you try) the next day/after the weekend.
You've never done developer work have you? You can't possibly function at a useful level for 16 hours a day. That's just an attempt at billing for twice the hours for approximately the same level of productivity as an 8 hour a day job.

Not nearly as many as it is apparently marketed as. You've replied a lot to this one comment, I see.
Look, maybe somewhere out there, bitcoin is a great solution. But it is marketed as this next great currency, yet it has little use to your average consumer. Is it good for merchants? Uhh... maybe. I guess it doesn't have chargebacks, but the only merchants that really benefit from that are ones that (usually) aren't worth dealing with (ones with crappy products and services, etc.) Other than that, the immediate availability of funds is ok, I guess, except banks are fine with providing the capital for large organizations to cover the time that checks and debits need to clear. So this isn't much of a gain, either.
Concerning consumers, the consumer demographic being targeted is typically the middle class white person. This demographic has far superior financial products, and good consumer protection. Bitcoin doesn't do much for them.
If there are other consumer groups that could gain, maybe they can get something out of it, but whatever these groups may be obviously aren't a large enough concern for other financial service providers to concern themselves with, so it's safe to assume they're a very, very small market.
@_date: 2014-09-21 14:39:49
I assure you, 99.999% of consumers do not spend their money because it will be worth a few percent less over the course of a year, and do actually purchase things because they want them.
And, IF they did spend because it will be worth a few percent less, then it means the value of the goods/services they are purchasing in dollars/whatever is close to the value they actually view it at, and if there is artificial demand from inflation and pressure in that realm, it can't be more than a few percent off of its actual value to them.
People re not hyper-rational and do not factor in inflation when purchasing day to day goods and services, you will only see that behavior if long term investment is involved (and you probably won't even see it then, either).

You keep saying this. I do not think you know what this means.
Now, I mean, if you want to say all comics are mentally unstable, sure, you COULD, but they're not. And there are many mentally unstable people with absolutely no sense of humor at all, so even if you could show me a DSM diagnosis claiming humor is an obvious sign of mental disorder (and you can't, although you'll find ones about glibness being part of a cluster of personality qualities for certain ones, etc.) there certainly isn't a one to one correlation of the stuff.
You know what IS a sign of mental instability, though? Thinking you're a genius online and able to make diagnosis from internet posts, as well as the delusional cult-like behavior you're espousing right now. It's probably safe to say that someone who is incapable of seeing humor in themselves being out of touch with reality (free-market anarchists, for instance) has some type of mental instability.

That's generally how supply and demand works, yes. Banks would gladly lend their money to anyone who can pay it back at a higher rate than what they are doing now. They tried expanding who they could lend to via complex monetary derivatives, which resulted in part of the 2008 financial crisis.
So, banks let a lot of people who WANTED loans but couldn't afford then get them - mortgages on properties they couldn't afford - hoping they'd be paid back (edit - which was easy to imagine, as house prices kept soaring, so no one really assumed the house prices would sink and thus cause even more problems for those who couldn't afford their loans easily... and then if they wanted out of the loan, they couldn't just sell the property and recoup their money to pay the balance). They realized this wasn't going to be the case, packaged the bad debt as derivatives, traded these derivatives, and when the debt started imploding on itself, it sent the globe into a downward economic spiral.
And now that they are being responsible again, they're being talked down on. lol

LMAO, you can't possibly think is behind the racist bullshit someone jumped to with it, can you? And that we are trolling this place?
You guys really think everything is a conspiracy to hold bitcoin down, when in fact, you don't realize you've created a clusterfuck that everyone else in the world is left scratching their heads at. No one's trolling you. You actually have people out of touch with reality here, and no one is using totes to try and spread FUD or whatever you think they're doing. They're all actually just laughing their asses off.
(Of note: Trolling, by definition, is claiming to hold a stance that you actually don't hold, on an online forum of some nature, to frustrate or get some form of a reaction out of the readers. If, let's say, the person is actually sincere in their statements, they are by definition not a troll. And I think buttcoiners are sincere in their sarcastic and snarky criticisms - thus, they are by definition not trolls.)

It wasn't ever meant to be a literal "THIS IS REALITY" statement. It is the hypothetical perfect solution to a hypothetical scenario. It's like when economists use a "perfect competition" model to base other models off of to examine the contrasts between two systems. "Perfect competition" doesn't exist in reality. It is a theoretical tool for comparing whatever the actual system you are trying to model is, to a hypothetical scenario that is a "base line".

This is just a new form of "decentralized" MLM, it has all the other characteristics, except the hierarchy is changed. You know there are companies own solely by the workers? And you know how those are different from normal companies, yet still fundamentally the same? No difference here.
Bitcoin has shown nothing concerning consumer adoption. It's not even on the radar as far as anyone can tell. Horrible eye towards business if you think merchants will adopt it to save a dollar or two, when consumers have no desire to use bitcoin. Consumers drive adoption, not the other way around - and no one wants to support bitcoin unless they can make money with it. And the only way to make money with it is to buy low and sell high. Now who bought low again? Not Joe Shmoe today, who decides the fate of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-21 22:08:07
"Fiat is going to experience hyperinflation shortly and bitcoin will eventually be a huge currency" is a good example - mainly because, while interest rates are very low and that is troublesome for the next monetary crisis/business cycle issue, it's definitely nowhere near "ZOMG END GAME SCENARIO".
Another ridiculous claim: "Banks are afraid of bitcoin." No... Banks would just adopt it. They aren't afraid of alternative currencies, and would generally welcome anything that would bring them more revenue - even to the point that they will create risky derivatives packages out of shaky home loans. That they aren't flocking to bitcoin should say something to most people, but for some reason, irrational ideological beliefs are clouding this view (it would appear).
And the belief that merchant adoption drives consumer adoption... just... no. We already tried a version of this marketed under the term supply side economics, and it is generally considered an abysmal failure... Although, once again, it is marketed as anything other than a failure by those who can gain from it.
Etc. There is more, trust me.

It's an indication of utilization, but not a particularly useful one, is what I am saying.
If it was something like "purchases of goods and services in bitcoin", that could be a useful metric. If it was something like "unique wallets (meaning, a new user, not just a person who had an account and makes a new one) created over time", that could be useful, too. But "number of transactions" is highly unreliable at best and misleading at worst.

Why would quality go up? What reason would there be for quality to go up? There isn't any other than some fantasy scenario in your head. The quality of the good is only as high as it needs to be for consumers to purchase it.
It will still cost more to produce high quality goods than it does to produce low quality goods. This will still reflect itself in the price of the goods. So high quality goods will still cost more. And if your money will be significantly worth more in the future, you will spend your money on the lower quality good versus the higher quality good (on average, for your average person, who isn't a bitcoin/funbux/USD/whatever millionaire).

No, the claim in question is whether banks are shitting themselves about bitcoin. There is no proof they are. He is calling into question the claim being made that they are, and doesn't need to provide proof otherwise.
They're not shitting themselves, as they traditionally invest in all sorts of new things. The whole derivatives market is pretty much their investment in speculative financial assets of high risk nature (usually). They're comfortable with risk, as they have "math" people on it doing calculations all day so they can make more money.
