Sorry to see that a lack of response is interpreted as snobbery. The reality is that attaching Bitcoin to a driver, celebrity, etc. effectively positions it incorrectly in people's minds: as a company or product, not an entirely new means of commerce.
This general topic always makes me think of the movie Idiocracy, where everything has a brand or product name on it (even to the point where instead of watering farms with water, the people use an offshoot of Gatorade). 
It's tough, because it sounds like a dismissal or "we're too good for that" sort of thing. Rather, it's an attempt to not make Bitcoin a joke, which despite their wonderful merits, Dogecoin is/was.

It was said elsewhere already, but Bitcoin is a technology, not a product. People are stupid (i.e. Interpret everything at face value), and positing Bitcoin as a *sponsor* of something suggests that Bitcoin is a company.

It's not about force, just visibility and inserting Bitcoin into consciousness. The goal should be subtlety at this point: put it out there and let others ask about it when/if they're ready. 
I like to think about all of this like a pop song. Why is Katy Perry popular? Because her song is on every radio and tv station (and yes, in a lot of those cases her visibility was paid/sponsored). The how doesn't matter when it comes to the mainstream, they could care less.

What's an honest path to mass adoption?
I've seen a lot of fodder about how "Joe Schmo" won't understand BTC (very likely) and be frightened off by its complexity. Part of the problem can be solved with technology (easy to use hardware wallets, services like coinbase/buttercoin). But what about the biggest issue: security/mindfulness (of having a bunch of money in your possession)?
Hardware wallets are cool, but it will only take one doofus dropping theres at a bar or running it through the laundry before there's a serious flip out. 
What's the likelihood of things like RFID implants or some sort of mechanism for storing BTC into the physical structure of your home (haven't thought too deeply about logistics)? If BTC is really to remain decentralized and see mass adoption, then a solution needs to exist for the average person that will swap with a traditional bank 1:1 without losing decentralization, security, etc.

I think Bitcoin marks a turning point in civilization in terms of how uninformed an individual can be. We're at a point, now, where every person needs to have a base level of knowledge about computers and personal security online. 
Instead, we've allowed for large swaths of undereducated people to roam about. Granted, access to proper education is abysmal and downright inaccessible to many. However, the basic concept of operating a computer and securing yourself online should be added to grade school curriculum. Not as some bullshit "sexual harassment panda" style of educational supplement, but a full-blown curriculum right alongside math, reading, etc.
It's time for big, big change. To deny or fight that is basically signing away the fate of the human race. Joe Sixpack desperately needs to not be a thing.
@_date: 2014-06-22 17:50:00
Really liking the idea of a secondary/internet based economy. This seems to be the most likely route. Much like commerce is split between online stores and brick and mortar, we'll see BTC become a powerful alternative/preference over time.
Actually exciting, because it suggests adoption will be more organic and people will slowly be introduced to it over time.

So how do we make it interesting again? To be fair, of course people will lose interest if all they see are people questioning the existence of the thing they supposedly believe in.
 priority should be figuring out how to distill the benefits of BTC into a people friendly chow. That may sound condescending, but it's not meant to: people inherently become bored with what they can't understand. 
Getting attention back means providing some sort of immediate value to owners. One proposal for this would be to draw the parallels between BTC and cash and explain the similarities and differences. It has to be tethered to something people understand first. Simply saying "fiat sucks" won't cut it (full disclosure: the term fiat wasn't in my dictionary until I started learning about Bitcoin).
Baby steps. Fundamental change doesn't happen overnight. BTC won't "click" for some time.

True. I'm referring more to resources invested across the entire Bitcoin community. In other words, there are so many people working on it from so many different angles that it has a significant chance of working because any holes/issues/etc. will be patched one way or another. People are investing what looks like a good part of their own lives/assets into it which, for me, says that success is likely (complete speculation).

I doubt most people have a political agenda, they just don't know because their parents didn't know and so on. The majority of people in the world take money from others because it's presented without explanation of consequence. Most people simply don't know any better. That may be hard to understand, but when a lot of people grow up in an environment where money isn't a thing, when they're finally given a chance to get access to it, they take it. This is how a lot of programs find success: they prey on the undereducated and make a profit on the result.

An all-in-one, low barrier solution. Almost like Coinbase. It should:
1.) Be multi-platform from day one.
2.) Give people a wallet and explain what it is.
3.) Give people an address and explain what it is.
3.) Help the user make their first transaction. See how Stripe demos their Checkout service with Watsi: 
4.) Offer a physical option (no third party) and explain the benefits up front.
5.) Offer free Bitcoin/other perks as a reward for going out and buying things for BTC.
6.) A better system than QR codes. These are super close. Someone mentioned Bluetooth LE a ways back? Best description is two people's Bitcoin bubbles temporarily connecting.
Beyond that: transparency and solid customer support. Communication MUST come first. Explanations of security in laymens terms should be available as videos from day one. Bonus points: find an insurance broker to do FDIC style insurance on investments up to $50k (or higher if possible).

Give them time. Apple is made up of a lot of hyper-talented people, plenty of which I'm sure are invested in Bitcoin.

OP demographic synopsis
@_date: 2014-10-26 14:24:03
I've kept all of it and will for some time. Businesses survive on cash flow, meaning, cash on hand that's accessible right this second (e.g. Paying rent, buying merchandise, paying employees, etc). It would be incredibly shortsighted to threaten the cash flow of your business, as it could mean closing you doors tomorrow. Of course, this is right now when Bitcoin is still valued on dollar amount. If and when Bitcoin starts to become valued on its own (i.e. 1 Bitcoin isn't $350 but just 1 Bitcoin), then I'd gladly move over. Right now it's too early to move a substantial amount of your business over to BTC without choke holding operations. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 20:53:06
Right. The issue isn't with money going missing, I would have made a big fuss had they tried that.
Rather, it's that instead of a quick painless process, I had to wait for 3-4 people to figure out and correct the mistake just to get two checks printed.

After reading a lot of Warren Buffet's partners writing (Charlie Munger), this isn't a surprise. Something like Bitcoin is a complete antithesis to everything they know. Also their maxim of not getting involved with what they don't understand prevails here.

There's probably a good reason (regulatory is my guess) as to why that type of business isn't allowed. That doesn't make Stripe any less trustworthy, though.

The easiest way around this is for the process of getting Bitcoin and spending Bitcoin to map 1:1 for existing systems. 
I'm eating lunch and looking at the people here, they simply won't care to get involved with a complicated process. For geeks, it's a no brainer. For the average person, they just want to know how they're going to buy diapers and groceries.

Lawsky and co. got exactly what they wanted out of this: a reaction. They wanted to see how compliant people really were and whether they'd even recognize something like BitLicense as an option. 
By debating and cursing BL, there's a direct acknowledgment of it. Rather what should have happened is complete ignorance and avoidance. What's apparent to them is that with the appropriate measures, anyone, even a business, could make all of their financial transactions anonymous with Bitcoin. This translates to a significant loss of tax revenue.
Proposing an outrageous set of rules knowing they'll be shot down will be followed up by a lesser, though equally destructive set of rules that *appear* to be more friendly.
Most will brush this off as conspiracy theory, but parallel this to what happened in Boston. Locking down an entire city for a manhunt was unnecessary. That was a test run to see how obedient people are and to what extent they can be controlled. BL represents something similar: "how bad can we spook people into not using Bitcoin?" They got their answer and now they're likely at work on round 2.

Correct, and I look forward to a future where I do all of my business in Bitcoin. However, outside of The Matrix USD is the language that customers, employees, and suppliers speak for now. I'm not psyched about it and suggest others look into Bitcoin often. The reality is that until they are directly threatened (e.g the woman in this article), the vast majority of businesses will not care. Yes, this takes into consideration the likes of Overstock who (I'd imagine) for the same reasons immediately convert BTC received into fiat.

Just ignore Lawsky and his rules. By paying attention to him you're giving him what he wants. 
Yes, I understand the legal implications of that but really, this is just another human like you and I, sitting somewhere making up "rules."

Just like all of the other tax laws, it's no surprise this is so complicated. The (presumed) goal is to confuse and scare both existing Bitcoin holders and anyone thinking about it (hopefully preventing).

Just figured this one out the other day. I'd been getting charged $25 a month for my business account. Turns out I was on an "enterprise" level account which meant I had to have a minimum balance of $10k (I opened the account in college so...).
Changing the account type to "basic" meant my minimum balance was lowered and the fee was erased. I would check if something similar is going on here.
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:35:20
I spent a small amount of time working in the newsroom of a local TV station (was an intern/broadcast major) for six months. The editorial process is limited at best. There are a handful of producers (who, from what I gathered are not paid terribly well) that have to fill a "rundown" for each newscast. They use a wire service like the Associated Press to pull down leads and write their stories. A number of times, I noticed that entire segments were 1:1 what the wire read (i.e. no real fact checking was done, it was just copied in as a script and formatted for spoken cadence).
Some of these pieces were sent to the web team and published on the website. Granted, this was 2009, so things have likely changed quite a bit. At best, though, the people writing these stories could probably care less about factual accuracy.
Just my opinion, but what I saw led me to pursue a career in web development instead of using my degree. I wouldn't say the people writing are "dumb" as much as they are just careless.

@_date: 2014-08-06 13:51:22
Good points. It's a weird balance. In essence, what you say is true: the majority have no evil intent. Rather, I see it as their intent is manipulated by the few evil in control (using things like money and fear). If this is the case, once someone has been convinced to use their "power" in a negative way, are they not now an accomplice and by extension equally evil?
The conspiracy isn't important as much as the why. Purely based on observation, it seems as though the majority of things like Lawsky is presenting come from a place of evil. There may not be a conspiracy per se, but we can't chalk up what he presented purely to negligence. My guess is he's the mouthpiece for a greater control (tightens tin foil hat and scowls at the black curtained window).

Just keep trying. What adults tell you is possible is the tip of the iceberg. If you're willing to work hard you can accomplish some cool stuff :)

This guy is smart and everyone should listen. 
What he's getting at is learning to play the game. The game is what the majority of people in the world subscribe to, like it or not. Bitcoin is a threat all on its own. Now, attach a lot of people like us who see the political power and the ability to overthrow oppressive regimes. The average yokel is terrified of that sort of thinking (i.e. It scares them away from things).
Chamath's point is to take something that currently *appears* threatening and tailor it in a way that *visibly* isn't. This is politics on an interpersonal level, yes, but serves an entirely different purpose. The goal isn't the agenda, it's the adoption. If we remove the political rhetoric (verbal/visible), it's underlying meaning and power are not going away. That's the Trojan horse: the threat is still there, but nobody knows it.

That's where Bitcoin needs to be. If it works with Apple Pay, we could start to see serious adoption.

For sure. I've looked at Bitcoin as a backup that's not always there. I.e. the money I spent to acquire it is gone (like I bought a big taco and ate it). If it soars and sticks, that will just be a nice "hey, kids, by the way..."

Allow me to introduce the Beef n' Cheddar scenario.
Dude is super high on his bet, convinced he's going to win. It's Friday and he's getting paid, so he says, "I'll be rich anyways" and hops into his 88' Corolla and heads over to Arby's.
After a bit of debate at the menu (causing a succession of honks behind him), he lands on the Beef n' Cheddar. Good price. Good taste. Just the right amount of splurge to celebrate his victory.
He gets his sandwich and decides he better eat it now, in its purest form. He finds a nearby parking spot and slips it out of the bag.
One bite. Two bites. Three. It's everything he'd hoped, a perfect cap on his victory.
But then. He sees a pretty girl across the way. He gets anxious and then thinks, "I'm going to be a Bitcoin mogul, I should ask her out."
With the slightest haze of sweat on his brow and a dabble of cheese on his collar, he gets out of his "bat mobile" (he acknowledges the hilarity of calling his beater that) and starts to walk over.
Just as he says "hey, you, what's your name?" a semi delivering a shipment of Beef n' Cheddars backs over him, killing him instantly.
TL;DR don't get cocky with Bitcoin or gambling, you'll be hit by a semi carrying Arby's sandwiches.

If you read the article, the problem itself—and the inability to rectify the problem—are a result of government ignorance. The suggestion, though not made, is that with a Bitcoin-based system, these problems wouldn't take place. Stories like these if read in the proper context add to the favor of Bitcoin because it eliminates the human element when it comes to minting (and influencing the price of) currency.

If the argument is “why doesn’t Nvidia have better support for Linux,” my bet is that they know it’s too small a market to have an impact on their business. Even though Linux is the backbone of many major systems, it’s likely that the types of systems that use their products are primarily NOT Linux-based (guessing, here).

Dollar. Cost. Averaging. Set a recurring buy for what you can afford to lose and let it track the price, good or bad (I do a $200/mo, bi-weekly on BTC and a $50/mo bi-weekly on ETH and LTC as a “future tax”). If you believe in the technology, that’s about as safe as you can get.

This is confirming my suspicion: they recognize the shift that Bitcoin as a whole (currency + blockchain) has the potential to produce. This whole blockchain only thing is a smokescreen, not naivety. It's likely that while they may not understand the entirety of the technical implications, they definitely see how Bitcoin, given the right blessing, will totally upend currency as we know it. "Caution" is CEO speak for "we've already made a decision on this and are positioning ourselves behind the scenes."
@_date: 2015-09-23 05:34:19
The reality is that in a business, especially one as contested as Bitcoin is at the moment, people will do really nasty shit to win. 
That the CEO of the company in question left a comment—with a clear explanation as to his personal feelings—is validation that the goal isn't malicious behavior. Don't be surprised if they need to make a sharp move to defend their business, though.
In this case, patents are poker chips. Coinbase is playing defense to make sure they're protected. This is a good thing. In respect to OSS, it would take huffing paint on Coinbase's part to unnecessarily attack smaller companies.
Think bigger. Like Circle. That is who the patents are for protection against.

Unfortunately, modern software development almost necessitates it as it's easier to trust someone else who's focused on the problem to get it right. Not to mention the time and costs to develop a security solution on your own.

You know what: I trust Coinbase.
There's far too much pitchfork shaking at a company that's been responsible for a lot of *good* in Bitcoin. A little bit of paranoia is fine, but you're essentially damning Bitcoin when you start to remove valid options for people to get into the market.
Realize: yes, a lot of Bitcoin folks are nerds, but the people who will help it move from nerd money/protocol into the mainstream will be people who rely on services like Coinbase. Anything that lowers the barrier to entry is a good thing. 
As an alternative, start to identify what you don't like about Coinbase and start a conversation with them. Work with them to improve the product. Maybe from your perspective they should offer more resources on the difference between storing BTC with them vs. on your own.

I know many will say "you're an idiot," and that's fine, but this should just be ignored.
It's obvious now that this is written in service of people who would benefit from limiting Bitcoin. That being the case, the next best solution is to circumvent. Create addresses, launder them, do what you have to do.  Transact with customers in New York and don't register or report.
That anyone is remotely considering this to be a possible future is extremely disappointing. It's the same institutionalized extortion that's ruined this country before.
