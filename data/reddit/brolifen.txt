Or could use a service that supports an authenticator app that generates a OTP like Google Authenticator which is linked to a device and not a number. Of course if your phone is compromised then that would be useless as well.

You have to look at the last 576 blocks (last 24hr) percentage to see a significant move, it's already on 73% by tomorrow it should be past 75%. Just in time for the new signaling period of 2 weeks to take place.

It depends on what you define as unhackable/hackable. But in some way or form everything is indeed hackable. It just depends on where the target is set, heck even bruteforcing is a proven method to get into wallets let alone social engineering, malware, keyloggers.... Basically when you become the target of hackers you're f\*\*ked.

Lightning does not popup on the same day as Segwit activation but takes months for not only a viable release to happen but also for the ecosystem to start using it.
