Some people are not as rich or smart as you are.

Not really. I thought he sounded an bit of an idiot. The interviewer asked multiple times what the value of the underlying commodity is and all he could respond with is "it's undervalued! Lol fiat is not backed by anything! Buy in now for the gains!!". 
How about explain exactly the value of Bitcoin as a payment method which doesn't involve banks and it's peer to peer? What was that bullshit around keeping all your money on exchanges because they will get hacked but you only lose 20% of your money but it doesn't matter!? Diversify across multiple coins??? Like sort of yes but he should be saying don't put all your money into crypto, if Bitcoin goes down it will drag everything else with it. He should be telling people to diversify across different asset classes and not go all in. 
I think he is everything wrong with the Bitcoin community at times. 
Don't get me wrong I'm positive it will keep going up too but he should have used his position to put forward reasons why people should use the tech and not just bang on about the price. People like that WILL mean this will turn into a bubble if everyone is just here for free money.

I don't think the people on here care TBH. I wonder how their tune would change if someone started sticking these on their cars, letterboxes or front doors.

Kudos if you actually do that but forgive me if I seriously doubt you will.

How is this relevant?

Doesn't matter if it's undercover or not. It is still exposed the the elements and will fade and degrade and look terrible and every person who walks past there has to look at a defaced pole rather than a nice clean sterile pole.

When it is hard to peel off because the cleaners didn't see it for a month so they just left it. Then a couple months later the weather has gotten to it and it's faded and looks like shit but still kinda sticky and collected dirt so it just looks like a black spot which is now staining the pole so even if it's cleaned off the pole still has a dark patch

In hindsight, when I heard the clueless receptionist at work talk about buying some just before the peak that was probably the sign to sell

If they think they investment in housing and securities are at risk they aren't going to go to an even higher risk market..
