And that would have fuck all to do with Bitcoin?

Proof of Jesus or GTFO.
Or, sorry I missed the /s.

It is true that the banks have to report deposits of over $10k.  It's been going on for many years.
Cops can take your money if they find more than $10k on you until you can "prove" that it is legally yours.

Yeah. [this]( video shows a continuous feed of drives into an industrial shredder.

Show her a chart of USD/BTC over the last 4 years.
She'd probably rush home to tell her husband about it.

I'm paying attention and will get in at some point, but in the meantime, I'm killing it trading AAPL options.

Why did he throw it away?

Honey, darling, sweetie; is there anything you'd like to get off your chest?

Depends on the source.
Normally, I'd look at Bitcoin as a classic bubble in the making.
I've been trading for almost 15 years now and I'm trading options almost exclusively for the past 4.5 years.
I've been paying attention to Bitcoin for quite some time and I've made more in Bitcoin than anything other than AAPL in years.
I was curious how it would handle these hockey stick moves and subsequent adjustments.  It was easy enough to go in  sell @ $140, buy @ $76 and then closed when I caught drift of the senate hearing @ $785. 
May go in again, but not for awhile.  I think it is a very significant and fascinating development.

Pretty much why I'm waiting.
