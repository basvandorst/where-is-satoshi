If everyone had knowledge of the beginnings and topology of cypherpunks/cryptocurrency then a commonality would exist. Some people claim tedium or ad nauseum regarding the reasoning behind your post, others portray overt agendas and targeted deception. Others who dedicate OP responses with walls'o'BS and knowingly subvert many(any) thread that tries to provide insight, angles, and depth to Bitcoin. I think that a philosophy of bitcoin economics/socionomics/arthoponomics is needed, reddit may not be the medium.

paleh0rse, don't you remember pardax? He was on the bitcointalk.org forums early on in 2010/2011 and always was a big supporter of everything we were trying to develop. /S Forget it... Hugo Smash!

Hey, biologists! Very cool. Thanks to the principles of Evo-Devo and competitive/cooperative systems, which I was studying in late 2009/early 2010, I discovered Bitcoin in its nascence. John Smart had written several articles linking evolution of complex system and referenced Evo-Devo extensively. This brought about a line of research for C Change events in finance and social networks. Bitcoin was a contender and I actually spent more time researching Ven and Hashcash than Bitcoin. By the time I returned to Bitcoin in November 2010, it was the lightning bolt of realization. It was finally here, something new under the sun.

Thin air from a vain man. you are doing that too much. try again in 8 min. you are doing that too much. try again in 5 min.  you are doing that too much. try again in 1 min. you are doing that too much. try again in 17 sec. I have been present since 2010 and you are a disgrace to Bitcoin and all that will befall. psych!

Do you partake in lotteries or games of chance throughout the year? If you find this annual amount near the price of 1-5 bitcoins imagine that as a potential buy-in point. Just find an arbitrary number that you are comfortable with and buy in at that amount and hold. Try to buy in at or near a correction or after the 'trap' set by the bulls or by the bears. You can check the bubble of 2011, when small groups were able to create large movement of the Market. Big money could be a few days away so launch when ready.

With many of the original goals of Bitcoin's development stalled or waylaid, I think a simple exercise in what is possible. I asked for a standardization/Protocol of Bitcoin in December of 2010, still waiting. This protocol is to prevent competing products from simply deprecating features or slowing/blocking features that were meant for inclusion way back when. The software is great but until 8.x, I was not confident that my product would be possible. 2 year delays are frustrating, so I support a user group as opposed to foundation format for sharing information and furthering development. (My product is not a crypto currency but contains features that use the XBit engine of hashing/merkle tree)

$0.19-$0.21 November/December 2010 was my introduction price. Actually, found Bitcoin while studying competitive currency Ven, April 2010 . The proposed value was $0.006 and I snubbed it!

You are thinking in terms of exclusive "users" group, I am thinking in terms of "inclusive" all possible groupings. Were you a early poster on the forums, circa 2011? We had exclusive groups setup camp over the direction of Bitcoin and it's protocol/features. Mike Hearn/Gavin/Hal were helpful in pointing me in the right direction for my Bitcoin-centric project. Others were scornful, dismissive, petulant and misinformed. Mike H's/Golgulski's bitcoinj/bitcoin-php, the impressive libcoin and PAL TVM scripting have saved me weeks of research. Some are helpful, some are not so helpful. User Groups help define location of key knowledge bases. That's what I want.

Symbiotic relationships with vampire squid does not affect Bitcoin, unless you want to play on the edges, near the dark. Get your perspective from the old-timers. Stay liquid in btc and avoid exchanges/fiat/FUD.

When I discuss Bitcoin with people they are concerned with the here and now, and what the future holds for them monetarily. The unique viewpoint that I hold is that I was actually looking for Bitcoin or a similar type of technology several years ago. I discovered Bitcoin in April 2010 when press was non-existent and the value was purported to be $0.006 per bitcoin. I revisited Bitcoin in late November just as the press of a Wikipedia disagreement was being discussed on the forums. 
I had been researching the technological breakthroughs that would enable finance and the archaic, centuries-old model of currency to be transformed into modern, decentralized networks. It was believed that the bottleneck on markets would be exerting pressure in such a manner that when this change arrived, it would quickly and mercilessly supplant the existing structure, akin to all other shifts of the recent past. Failure to correct the missing grease in the wheel of economics forced the petrified response of policy setters to now be too little, too late.

I was on the old alternative chain wiki and found some notes by you and nanotube concerning DNS on the merkle tree system. How much notes do you have on this? What is the viability of the project and your feelings about namecoin/BitDNS/DNS_Chain?

How I discovered Bitcoin was due directly from an investigation for the rapid technological shift that should be occurring. The missing wealth of the current markets was due to a bottleneck of an ancient financial system straining under the weight of fast-paced, networked public. 
April 2010, Bitcoin was in its infancy and other potential pretenders were vying for correct analyse of the new emperor clothes. Bitcoin was to be, expected, empowered, embraced. 
To those who knew, we marveled at the simple nature. Technology is not always about complexity, sometimes it is about sober rethinking of an old foe. Web-of-Trust breaking the chains of FUD/marketing and centuries.
