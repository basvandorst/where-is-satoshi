How does this work? I think I understand how investors won't be buying btc, but how can the brokers not as well? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:52:52
I was aware of the math, though others might not have been. Not sure of your point though? I don't think an 80% dip would kill bitcoin or even leave most bitcoin supporters that upset. I just don't think it dips that much.

Hitting 40k before, and being at 40k on 1/1/18 are different. But I'll try to remind you!
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:06:28
Can you explain how they aren't coupled with btc? I get they are cash settled but how can the brokers operate a futures market without actually owning any btc?
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:23:20
Thank you this helps for sure! I understand futures(some) but it was the cash settling with removing the commodity that was getting me lost. Still doesn't completely make sense to me but I understand better now.

Woke up this morning to 15,255!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:35:16
How would the 2 prices diverge? Is this because the futures market determines btc price between a certain time interval and btc trades 24 hours a day?
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:28:04
This was the answer I was looking for!! Thanks for putting together the example this helped me a lot! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:14:54
Atm if it's near you? Or local bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:53:39
This was my original thought process but if what other people are saying is correct CME won't actually be hodling any btc. They'll simply be acting as a middle man for people who want to "bet" whether btc price will go up/down, while never actually transacting btc. So the money CME will be making would solely be on trading fees.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:44:05
You could try a bitcoin atm, they charge pretty high fees but you'll get verified and get your bitcoin right away. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:28:06
Do alt-coins need to be transferred to bitcoin before back to fiat?
Edit: Thanks guys!

Your previous comment, 


Led me to think your question was sarcastic and you had some big reveal. I can be wrong too, I've got no problem admitting that. And I comment and try to discuss things on here to learn more and gauge other people's thoughts, so I wanted to preemptively shift the discussion towards being constructive, and managed to do the opposite. That's my bad!

What are thoughts on bitcoin atms? How secure are they? What would be the best way to store btc from an atm? And what is a transaction from one like?
Second part, with bitcoin futures around the corner how will that impact the actual bitcoin marketplace? If the futures market is all cash settled is it just a secondary marketplace to actual bitcoin pricing?
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:18:23

It seems most other crypto currencies are down, is there a way to tell if this is people trading other cryptos for bitcoin? Vs fiat to bitcoin? Do other crypto currencies need to be transferred to bitcoin before back to fiat? I've never actually been sure.

I think coinmama let's you buy your first 150 without any verification. If you live near a bitcoin atm, it seems to be worth the upcharge vs waiting for verification. Otherwise maybe localbitcoin

Up 22%, 14,555 when I just looked at coinmarketcap
I wish I could get a credit card.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:45:41
I think 12/17 goes down like 11/13, except without mt gox to crash, I don't know if bitcoin will either. I expect some market correction but not the 80% dip like after mt gox. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:25:23
If it doesn't by when?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:36:31
Firstly, thanks for the depth to your response, I love it!!
I never said media has our best interests in mind, I'm well aware of who owns the media. Most of the media analysis I've seen of bitcoin isn't positive! That's why it doesn't scare me as much, because the media is trying to scare the public and its not working. It's backfiring. I've had more people ask me about bitcoin in the last month than ever before. And they have no idea what it really is, they come in thinking it's a bubble that's past it's time to burst and saying it's not even a blip in the financial world and leave with me sending them tons of links tp read and videos to watch. I can only minimally explain things so I shift where there looking to places that actually understand bitcoin.
I think you meant btc market cap is 250 billion(edit: i just saw the decimal, .25T, my bad). My prediction is based on looking at previous growth rates vs the current one and we're just reaching the end of the gradual raise up to the spike up. Also I'm someone who thinks Metcalfe's law applies to bitcoin, since bitcoin is as much it's network as it is the currency, the value of the network is proportional to the number of connected users. 
I never said I have the capital to fight wall street, but the community and new adopters as a whole could slow them down. But I largely agree with your last 2 paragraphs, but I'm still torn and hold hope that we as a community can fight back. I do think there will be a large correction/dip but I don't think it happens til btc hits 100k+. And I do accept the very real possibility wall street does everything you say and you are right. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:38:15
It's mostly driven in Korea, so less likely but not impossible
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:47:50
Network economics, or Metcalfes law. It goes back to the original adoption of the telephone and states "the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square number of connected users of a system"
Bitcoin isn't just an expression of value but the network that the value communicates on, so one could assume it would follow Metcalfes law. This doesn't mean it can't be a bubble though. Once the network reaches a critical mass, 1 of 2 things can happen.  the technology/network is ready for that mass and we see stabilization or  we reached too high, too soon and we see a significant correction(repeat til  is achievable). We are most likely in case  the technology/network aren't ready for mass use cases yet. This current drive up we are on is hugely important for the long term success of bitcoin though. It's showing that masses are ready to accept it and we're ready for commercial/retail uses. It's up to businesses/governments to get on board and accept bitcoin before we see case  come to fruition.
This is most similar to the late 90's dotcom bubble, the internet wasn't established enough yet for all the sites popping up to succeed. The bubble burst, tons of sites failed and fell off the map but the internet came out of it stronger, and is bigger than ever and we don't hear about the internet being in a bubble anymore.
Crypto bubble will burst(likely) in 2018, tons of alt-coins will fall off the map, crypto will be stronger because it will exemplify the weaknesses for mass usage, and out of that will(hopefully) come the solution.(The internet was extremely difficult to navigate before Google)
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:16:15
I get that, but no one has said anything to explain how that actually works. I would like to understand it!
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:05:05
Ah thank you. I was thinking he meant the btc price on exchanges vs the price CME will be using daily. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:40:29
I read a lot on this sub that bitcoin is not a stock so stop treating it like one. I think this recent jump is starting to get more people to believe that's true. While your right there is a chance this wall street manipulation, I think it's more likely this is mass adoption. I've seen bitcoin on every financial website, tv station, and newspaper the last couple weeks. I personally think bitcoin hits 40k before 2018, not sold wall street will successfully manipulate bitcoin. They can try to pump nd dump, but with all the recent publicity it's getting it could be hard to sell more than people are buying
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:48:07
Do you have any actual evidence or other cases that bitcoins support is regressing other than steam dropping it? Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:46:03
Damn autocorrect
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:05:33
Could you elaborate what you mean? How does day trading work?
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:52:27
Ok. So then hodlers are team owners? CME is the bookie. Investors are the betters. Games is a day in the market. 
The bookie/better have no real influence on games, teams, or athletes but created a separate marketplace where they can profiteer from them. It's starting to make some sense, this just seems different than what I've studied about futures markets. And the potential impact it will have on btc. So if I'm understanding correctly, the bitcoin futures market will have no direct impact on the actual bitcoin price. It's just people betting on what the price will do? (But individually they could still be involved in the btc market)
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:01:58

As a professional trader how much time did you spend learning about futures, difficulty of investment entry barriers related to market impact, and market indicators? You seemed to leave out in your analysis that bitcoin futures are cash settled. In my understanding that means the underlying asset(bitcoin) isn't traded, so how does the futures market place directly impact the bitcoin market place? Since the markets seemingly have no direct impact on one another and the futures market doesn't trade any bitcoin, how does a bitcoin futures market make it easier to invest in bitcoin?


 Also, since once again no bitcoins are exchanged on the futures market, how does the addition of the bitcoin futures markets add any stability to bitcoin?(kind of an extension of my second question) 
I could keep going with questions but I think answering these will help me solve the rest, thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:17:31
You're kind of my hero right now
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:58:24
I completely get and understand what you're saying. It seemed like people previously in this thread were saying CME wasn't going to be actively trading bitcoin, which I didn't understand for the reasons you've said. 
This is a huge distinction for me though whether CME, and other exchanges now, will actually be trading btc. And at what rate. Are they obligated to keep trading to match or pace with the futures contracts? Or can they invest at there own pace in whatever they want? Ie hedge btc futures against gold. Not saying they would or it's a good idea, just curious about the companies obligations vs practices.

Technology - the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes.
I don't think your definition would be incorrect. But both blockchain and bitcoin are separate technologies. Bitcoin uses the blockchain and not the other way around. But blockchain technology will continue to spread throughout industries transforming them and bitcoin is the best of its kind for crypto currencies, and crypto currencies are probably the best implementation of the blockchain we'll see. I have a hard time imagining bitcoin losing its community and its computing power to another crypto, and think it's set up to actually accel when the crypto bubble pops.

CBOE opens bitcoin futures exchange December 10 at 5 or 6pm eastern. CME opens there's December 18th. CME announced first but CBOE jumped in front of them to release.

My league is doing something like this too. We have a lawyer and a banker in our league, so they set up some non profit to hold the coins, something about the league being a social club. I can ask them about the details if you'd be interested in something like that. We only have it for a 5 year hold pot, so we haven't had to collect out yet. But it should give us a better chance of paying no/less taxes when the time comes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:18:15

I'm not sure about the sending it to wallets, haven't actually bought from atm. But fees vary on amount you buy. I know they're high regardless but for the instant purchase it could save/make USD.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:21:57
That doesn't help me :/ I think I'm overthinking it, but I just can't get myself to understand how there could be a futures market with no actual trading of the underlying asset.
In sports betting I don't see the underlying asset equivalent to what btc is. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:20:07
That's one of my go to articles. It does a great job of explaining how and why bitcoin is a currency, and actually more than that. I do hope someone has some awesome simple way to explain it, but my best results come from time, patience, answering questions, and not being pushy. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:02:50
CME wouldn't be offering futures if they didn't think it to be profitable long term, which means the price ultimately will go up. If I read correctly CME is limiting futures to +/-20%, which seems to me to be wide enough to absorb some of btc's volatility but a small enough window to increase volume in a sustainable way. 
I don't know how CME would operate a bitcoin futures exchange without actually buying and selling bitcoin. The average investor into CME bitcoin futures doesn't need to physically hodl the bitcoin, and would only need to transact in USD.
I think if I understand correctly too, the biggest thing CME offering bitcoin futures will do, is give corporations an entry way into holding bitcoin as an asset with a familiarity for accountants and the IRS and other regulatory committees. Which would lead to both increased price and volume.

I've been preaching to my friends for a while now. In August I convinced my fantasy football league to add a 5 year pot for various categories and hodl it in bitcoin. One of my buddies in the league who was initially opposed, he admittedly knew nothing about it and is in banking/finance, last week he heard about CME starting to offer bitcoin futures and text to me to ask more about bitcoin. He still isn't 100% convinced, but he's on the cusp and is getting interested. He doesn't understand a lot of the technical computer stuff, but is getting over that he thinks it's all some guy in his moms basement ripping everyone off.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:53:40
That's part of the issue. There is no explain like I'm 5, it's far too complicated. Which is part of why it's taken 8 years for it to start catching on. And part of why it's not going anywhere.
The way I chipped away at my friend was getting across what decentralized means. And explaining how much power is truly behind bitcoin, in terms of cpu and energy consumed. I'm not always the best at explaining things so I generally share articles, from highly reputable sources across any field.
