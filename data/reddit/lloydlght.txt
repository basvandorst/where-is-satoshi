i say if there actually gonna be war and government is using bitcoin, i am sure they have someway to fluctuate the price or simply has more coin due to they have much more advanced mining equipment than us.

somebody just cashed out 18 Million.
That's a sign. if the big boy are starting to cash out, you want to leave this market ASAP

google" great capital hill baby-sitting co-op crysis"
It's exactly like the situation now with bitcoin.ppl treat it as commodity instead of currency.
Frankly i don't think how widely accepted bitcoin is gonna be in the future matters.
What matters the most is whether or not ppl willing to use it.

i am predicting a price reduce in graphic card

money laundering is such a huge problem they literally arrange a staff or two in every single bank branch to look into this problem.
It's just highly unlikely they will be in favor of this currency.

now this is interesting. Does that mean the platform has no money in now and have to pay tens of thousands of bitcoin in cash to its user?
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:34:41
i would not call this a crash.
this is more like a trend.
More and more country will public statement like this.
But isn't the whole bitcoin thing is to be as far off goverment as possible?

But you can't deposit fund into BTCChina. not now. not ever. All the possible means is banned.
It's now much like bathtub with faucet just turned off and plug leave on.
how on earth would  the water level( price) raise?
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:25:56
Yes of course.
But don't you see the platform starts charging same rate when everybody wants to withdraw. normally at 3%.
Regardless how the digital currency works, the platform, if doing international transfer, still has to go through federal reserve and apply for foreign currency, so there will be fee imposed on them which in turn charged  on the user.

i still don't understang why this is such a hype to Western ppl.
you already have free currency that could be traded almost anywhere. why use bitcoin instead of your credit card?
don't you think if this bitcoin has gone big enough it will be regulated anyway? paypal and other banks will just sit there and watch ppl transferring money without a fee?
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:29:20
you can't. there is no way to trace or prove.
And the best part is that normally where the bank or central reserve goes in and solve, in bitcoin world we have a bunch of ppl claiming inventing bitcoin yet we don't know whether or not their identity is real.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:01:31
i am all for digital currency but i just have not seen the point to use it yet. Amazon, ebay, these sites make monetary transaction already safe and fast enough.
for now i can't think of a reason to hold bitcoin just for the sake of to spend it in the future. Investing? way more risky than acceptable.
IF oneday it goes mainstream then i will just purchasing my fair amount and use it instead of holding it now and dreaming its value skyrocket.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:17:52
you see what's your logic flaw here?
If bank can charge ppl for giving them money then obviously indian banks have some enormous power.
They can ban bitcoin overnight no doubt.
Stuff happens in china is an example. users deposit large sum of coin in platform such as BTC and when shit goes down they all wanna cash out at the same time. no platform have those kind of cash to support it. the result is tons of ppl got stucked with bitcoin they can't neither sell nor cash out and watch it losing its value.

They love saving and ever there s a hype, everyone goes after it like crazy. Look into their real estate market, you will get a thing or two.
My family had a condo in there back in the 90's. the price went up almost 20 times. It's like everything they do they do it "Tulip Mania" style
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:32:33
this is absolutely right.
Although i never see why bitcoin has to have a value.
since it is anonymous could it be just a intermedia to transfer money  from A to B? user can set the amount they want to deposit and after transaction it resets to zero.

China is probably the only country has real need for digital currency as they have a restricted foreign exchange policy.
Just think about, bitcoin has no use to ppl who intend to shop domestically in the western world. Why would you convert your money to Bitcoin, spend it, and the shop convert it back while you can just swipe your card.
not to mention its price can crash almost 40% in a day.
essentially it's for transaction between different currency, but most of the world accept dollars now, so there is that.
of course it has the anonymous feature but regardless whether or not what you are buying is illegal, the un-traceable feature of bitcoin makes it almost too easy for the other party to con you.

It is true that Baidu accepted it and i am sure other tech company will follow up soon enough, but that's about it. You know you are talking about a country where majority of small restaurant and shop don't even accept credit card.
If ppl got nowhere to spend bitcoin, they are gonna cash out. instead of bring capital in, it is actually bring capital out as they bought it from Mtgox or other foreign trading platform in the first place but sell domestically.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:46:21
you probably can't.
no one wants to pay in a currency that drop or soar 50% a day.
