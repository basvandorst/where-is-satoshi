Did a test stream today on my android phone using Chrome. Input my cashout address ( 18pksgcorT2bFJrVYpa3FiH5ZhQ1TxVZih ) - got a check mark, started stream. Went to the stream link on my PC, and the BTC address shown to watch it is NOT the one above - it's 1QDS3FndjBhZYoXncrWF4TVL8mE4PCXDuB . So I pay for 5 minutes anyway - thought maybe this addy will pay mine when I end the stream. Nope. It sent the BTC to another address that I don't control!
The cashout address is in my Mycelium android wallet on the same phone I did the stream with, and I sent from that same wallet. I see no incoming transactions... only the 2 sent transactions. I tapped "end and cashout" and everything. If i close my streamium android Chrome tab and reopen streamium.io, I get a popup dialogue that says I have BTC coming so "check your wallet!"
Still Nada after all 6 confirms...
help? Thanks
edit: tried new paper wallet addr, different machines, obscure name for the stream - the same receive address 1QDS3FndjBhZYoXncrWF4TVL8mE4PCXDuB is shown. Streamium hacked? Needs a reboot?

UPDATE: I now see coins moving from the P2SH addresses back to my wallet - to the addr's they came from - so something is happening! yay

That was my first thought - that the receiving addr on the pay to watch page was an intermediate address. The test transactions I did were only ~8 cents each... but I still have not received those coins after more than a week. i HAVE seen them broadcast to my wallet... but with zero fee, so the transaction gets cancelled and tries again - but apparently has not been included in any block because of the zero fee (?)
