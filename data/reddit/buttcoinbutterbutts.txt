The truth is out there.

**IF** bitcoin 'succeeds', it will be very expensive relative to fiat, but nobody knows if/when it will happen.

If you don't get it, I'd say you need to build up some life experiences. It made perfect sense.

Soon I expect, but nobody knows. It's getting more difficult every day to deny it will happen. Just keep doing what you know is right, of you believe a crash is inevitable and you'll do good.

Bankcoin will always be at least second to bitcoin. Especially when their current 70 year old ponzi scheme explodes in everyone's face just about any minute now.

For a cooler experience, put it on a copay wallet, in a multi sign account. Much more secure, but requires twice the backup effort. Even better, make it a 2-of-3 sig wallet and keep one only on paper in case the other guy kicks the bucket. Bottom line is "experiment" and "explore" everything with little amounts to see how amazing it all is.

And bitcoin will always be 2 tx/s, right?

The supply is not going down - issuance is. Subtle difference.

CW/Satoshi could very well be spending from the newer coins. There would be no way for us to tell if they were his or a later adopter.

A more efficient vaporware version of etherium mistware.
