You're using a loose definition of "can" there.

Holding cash is absolutely horrible for an economy as a whole. 
If you want to passively grow wealth there are so many options ranging from near zero risk to as high of risk as you'd like already. And all of these options don't include stagnating an economy.

No. But USD is stable enough due to too many reasons to list out that a large portion of the entire world uses it as a basis of transaction. 
BTC can easily fluctuate 20% in a single day and is far from a proven long term asset. 
I personally believe in cryptocurrencies and the revolution blockchains will bring, but hell, maybe in 2018 a new cryptocurrency is released that incorporates a revolutionary feature that we all go "oh... of course that needs to exist. How were we so stupid?!" and makes all current crypto antiquated and useless.
We are still working out the details. Over time it will balance out and we will settle into a stable protocol but we are still a good way from that point. To compare BTC to the reliability of the USD as a vessel of wealth is silly at the moment.

Someone on who is talking with reason and wisdom not meme culture? I feel like I just entered a new dimension.

I do want to dive back into the argument with bitcoin though. 
It's so completely different than the USD. 
Between banks not being necessary for storage (although they aren't today, but they will definitely take a slightly different role for the common consumer) and deflation being the natural state instead of inflation. 
I wonder if there is some sort of mechanism that can hold off the deflationary spiral of some bit of deflation is defined into the currency.

I'm trying hard to remember all my inflation specific classes (not Econ 101, graduate economics. I was micro focused though so I hated macro classes) but one of the major reasons for the fed keeping inflation at 2% is because that is the USD average and that is the expectation baked into every loan/line of credit attached to the USD. Having a constant rate of inflation is important as to not add another level of risk into these debts and this increase interest rates unnecessarily. 
Now, there are plenty of other reasons to favor inflation over deflation. Wealth sitting idle is VERY harmful to a macro economy. In a deflationary environment it becomes quite lucrative to just shove cash under your mattress (or your paper wallet) and let it sit. In an inflationary environment you are encouraged to put your money to work doing something. Invest in your friends business, a bigger business (stocks), a pool of investments (what do you think banks are doing with the money in your savings account/CD?). 
The big reason the Great Recession dragged out for so long was because banks had every incentive in the world to just hold their cash reserves instead of reinvesting them. And that was at a stagnant macro state, not even deflationary. 
I dont know enough about it anymore (it's been a long time since those classes) to make a definitive case, but deflation is scary on a macro level. You can't just think on an individual basis.

Armchair meme-economists. Best to ignore them.

Are there any less meme-y bitcoin/crypto subreddits?

Deflation kills investment too. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:00:50
How does that work?
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:13:34
I disagree.
Bitcoins main weak point is lack of universal adoption, not that a handful of people think it is only for criminals. The majority of people who are don't buy into the future of bitcoin are the people who think it the pet project of a bunch of nerds but has no real value. The fact that major organizations and publications such as Fortune Magazine and Wall Street Journal are raising Bitcoin into the limelight like they are (the ENTIRE cover?!?!) gives Bitcoin legitimacy.

Your logic makes no sense. 
Deflation means that holding cash (bitcoin) is a sound investment in itself. You said it yourself, people save and sit on money. 
How does this create more investment?
If I'm making 2% with zero risk, why would I invest in a new company that gives me a 3% ROI but comes with a bit more risk? 
If you're trying to argue that 10 years down the road there will be more wealth to invest since people hordes for so long and their bitcoin became more valuable, that's wrong. The reason the bitcoin became more valuable was because bitcoin were lost. Overall the amount of wealth stayed the same it just became more dense where people hoarded it. 
Active investment creates wealth, not hoarding cash.

What are you even talking about?
Inflation is measured with CPI, the Consumer Price Index. The CPI is basically "Last year this grocery cart of items cost me $100 to buy. This year the exact same grocery cart of items costs me $104 to buy."
The measure of inflation has absolutely nothing to do with the total number of dollars floating around in peoples wallets and bank accounts.
But let's even assume I am 100% wrong, that the meaning of inflation in monetary terms is related to supply of a currency, not it's 'value'. Then why in the world is it even important?

This whole thread started with this statement. And that is what 99% of people are talking about in when they talk about inflation/deflation.
People talk about the supply of bitcoins because supply can be a major driver of inflation. Supply is the biggest tool that the Fed uses to manipulate inflation.
The fact of the matter remains that other forces are MUCH more impact on the value of BTC than supply right. And let's be honest, nobody gives a crap about the supply of bitcoin. At the end of the day they care about the value of bitcoin.
We can talk semantics all day long. But that isn't what people are really talking about when they are talking about an "invisible 3% tax".
