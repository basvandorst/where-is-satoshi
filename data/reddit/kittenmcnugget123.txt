Well he clearly was bragging to everyone about his bitcoin investment on the way up but doesn't want to get ragged on when it goes down.  If that's how he feels he should keep his investments to himself.

Right but you missed my point.  Bitcoins value is still measured only in fiat currency, as is every asset. All that matters is it's value in relation to fiats as you the coins don't currently act as a true currency given that you still have to convert to fiat to spend it.  I agree with you about the idea of blockchain being an interesting technology but I would compare Bitcoin to the Lycos of the internet era. Search engines are an amazing technology but the Google of cryptos hasn't even been invented yet.  It's likely that a faster, better, crypto currency will be adopted.

And yet bitcoin means nothing other than a representation of fiat in the form of an asset.  That's like saying I only care how much gold I have but I don't care about it's price.

right but the beer isn't priced in bitcoin, it's priced in usd, because it can't be priced in bitcoin due to volatility.  It would be like pricing something in gold.  Right now it's an asset not a currency.  To your first point, past performance doesn't indicate future results.  Pets.com had appreciated at a similar rate to bitcoin prior to the tech wreck.  It no longer exists in any form, the same could happen to bitcoin.

Stop telling every person you see that you own bitcoin.  Your coworkers shouldn't have to hear about every investment you make.

Time will tell, but at least you have some conviction.  Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered.
