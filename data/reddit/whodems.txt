The db was sold for about 100 btc a few days ago

Of course.

I'm looking at a video someone from Japan made on youtube. It looks cool.. but I don't think this is the technology's final form yet - not that technology has a final form.. rather I would say it's still in beta.

I know that feel. I'm not an idiot when it comes to programming but I haven't been hacking since I was a child so I'm pretty sure I will get absolutely destroyed by anyone who takes it seriously. 
Yea, I think there will be a lot of opportunity around these two technologies in the future. It's a great place to try and start some sort of career. I actually thought of applying to Coinbase a while ago but decided that if I played with BTC jobs I would only do something that was fully BTC, not an exchanger. 
The 3rd party company idea is good. Of course that requires being a value provider. I wouldn't know where to start providing value to say an Oculus type company.

It doesn't. Nutrients can migrate to isolated cells 


No. Cells are too small and too numerous for this to be a reality. Cancerous tumors though can create their own blood supply. 


It doesn't. It continuously flows *past*.


Cell walls are both an intake and an exhaust. Metabolites go in, metabolic waste goes out. All goes into blood, or comes from blood. Think of blood as a highway of molecules. Cells can pull from or contribute to this highway.

I know this is going straight to the front page I just want to make it very clear: this shit sucks.

How about single user persistent medical nano bots that only fight off infections when they are given bitcoins?
Might be an interesting way to 'take your medicine'
I have some type of medicine/biology background so i'll definitely check this stuff out. I hope it's not one of those 'we found a cure for AIDS (again)' things.

Does it create waste? I looked on youtube and I saw one that requires a 'power pukk' or something like that. Best case scenario would be 'add water, charge, dump water' and repeat.

YO SKRILL DROP THE PRICE
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:37:10
Hmm? I don't really understand the distinction you made. Then again most of that stuff was before my time. I got some learnin to do still.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:17:19
Mind explaining in your own terms what that means?
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:26:20
Interesting. It seems to line up with what the NSA is doing. I wonder if the emphasis will be on aggregation or prediction. Possibly need one for the other.
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:07:43
Very interesting. I'm a skeptic though. I can imagine small use cases where this would work, but other than that I think we might see hybrids more than anything.

I've heard this term thrown around the subreddit a lot. Haven't really wrapped my mind around it yet. Is Bitcoin the first one?
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:35:25
What kinds of things are people printing right now? Anything useful?

I've been trying to wrap my mind around how to invest in VR. I don't think there is any way to do it directly right now. Keeping my eyes and mind open though.
Instead what I have concluded is that you need to build something useful to that space. Be a dev (requires lots of skills), build a relevant website, etc. Old school money making methods. 
I too think VR will change more than just videogames. I think it will change everything that has to do with interacting with technology. Even the mighty hollywood will change.

no problem. hopefully you get more airtime soon. local newstations seem to be getting interested in bitcoin.

You did a great job man. I think he, and maybe by extension, his listeners didn't fully understand it still, but I think he realizes it's not some silly little made up numbers now.
The part where you said it solved a problem that was decades old seemed to click with him. I think stressing on the big picture things like that helps people understand that Bitcoin is actually important and not just a hobby/fad.
I too am trying to find a quick and true way to explain cryptocurrencies to other people. Incase I ever have to.
I think somethings to drill on would be
1. worldwide - instantaneous. low fee.
2. not owned by any corporation or country.
3. solved the byzantine generals problem 
That would be why it is important from a technical standpoint - and this leaves out all the political and economic reasons which most people wont want to hear.
As for a true answer to the why, I think the analogy you made to internet was good. I would just highlight how in 1994 the internet was just a connection from terminal to terminal.. facebook didnt exist yet, but it made it possible.

Significant, and dangerous. I'm gonna research this like crazy starting tomorrow, thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:24:33
Ah that's kind of abstract. So kind of like the intersection of big data and AI? No AI might be a stretch...
Very interesting though. I think I found a new thing to play around with. Thanks!
Btw have you done any work in this area yet?
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:43:02
Yes this is quite the challenge. Has to be so simple that grandma could do it. 
I'm not sure if hardware wallets are the future, but then again, I haven't contributed anything of value to that space myself. It's a good brain teaser though.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:18:46
Have we put these into someone's bloodstream yet or is it just testing?
@_date: 2014-03-11 11:36:01
Ah nice. Yea that's what my gut feeling was. Do you think there is any way for someone outside of the academia world to contribute or get involved in this kind of stuff? Barrier to entry seems too artificially high.
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:24:23
Yea i fucking hate bitcoin too. Give me all of yours so I can burn them
pls reply

I wouldn't go that far. 400 again? ehhhhh

Awesome! I am checking out those three links now. I had heard of them before, but never investigated for some reason.
Protein folding is a very interesting problem to me. Do you think it is solvable? Has it been solved for small length chains? Do such chains even exist in vivo?
Also, what makes it so hard to solve? Now that we can find the shape and AA makeup of proteins, and now that we know about domains and such, shouldn't we be well on our way to the 'ab initio' method of protein creation?
