Took me ages to verify my ID on Coinbase when it was working earlier this year. They were very picky about the photo used - you need to make sure it is well lit and looks like you.
Bitstamp I did last week, but still waiting on. There is a message that it will take over two weeks, and I imagine the holiday period doesn't help with that either - I'm not really expecting it to complete until January.

The difficulty is set so that a block is mined _on average_ every 10 minutes. The interval between blocks varies - checkout [blockexplorer.com]( which updates whenever a new block is mined. The size of the block has no effect on how easy it is to mine though.
Block size can vary - an empty block will only be a few bytes long.

The entire fee. But at the moment the transaction fees are low compared to the reward from mining the block itself. The system is setup though so that as time goes on, the reward from mining the blocks goes down and the transaction fees are expected to make up more of the payoff.

The block timestamps are used when calculating the difficulty. The aim is that 2016 blocks should be mined in 14 days. Every 2016* blocks, all the nodes compare the timestamps of the last block and the one 2016 blocks before that, and perform the same adjustment for difficulty. Since everyone has the same consensus on what the blockchain looks like, everyone will get the same answer - irrespective of how accurate their local clock is, delays on the network etc.
(* Due to a bug, it's actually 2015 blocks used for the calculation. But the design was for it to be done after 2016 blocks.)

Has it worked out? He needs to sell it before he actually makes money on it - AFAIK that hasn't happened.

You may find [this map]( useful then.

There is evidence that the system hasn't been constructed properly in the first place. For example, leaking internal error messages from backend servers is a strict no-no in security, and particularly in banking. Some of the content of those errors also looks a bit concerning. It smells of bad architecture.
