If BTC goes to ~ $100K in the next 1-2 yrs, that’s about a $146 bkfst. Tolerable, and the pleasure of “spedning” in this fashion outweighs the potential “loss” of $127. Good on ya, mate!

Bitcoin is my thing in a vey big way, and I’m by no means even close to millennials … or gen Xers for that matter … and most of the millennials I talk to are clueless about bitcoin and own none. All that to say, don’t generalize

Last time I checked, HodlHodl wasn’t available to U.S. citizens.

I hear ya, and my dad would ask that about most any decision in life. “Sure hope this restaurant is the best decision.” Kind of guy who wears suspenders AND a belt … just in case. His letter and check came unexpectedly. I’ve said from the beginning, “Only invest what you can afford to lose”  etc and he keeps on investing. Seems BTC is only things he’s willing to risk on, and he has his kids squarely in mind.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:55:44
Couldn’t agree more! My dad rocks!
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:04:59
Nope. Dollar cost averaging.

This check is for Investment in Bitcoins. When deposited, it should make our total investment into Bitcoin at $30,000. (Correct?)
P.S. Hoping we are doing the right thing.

This was a check, but he still sends birthday money in cash.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:54:40
Totally. The man still loves snail mail, still writes checks at the grocery store ��, doesn’t own a mobile phone or laptop, but he does own an iPad, and he’s learned to send me text messages …daily … sometimes a bunch … and he always asks, “Did you get my emails?” ��

Damn straight! ������������
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:56:19
2FA across the board, brotha. Use Trezor also, and just got Yubikey. Try to follow best practices and am uber-skeptical of / hyper alert to strange messages.

He started investing in early 2016 … on his own volition. One of the most risk-averse, conservative people in the world, so I was surprised, but he wanted to do this for his kids. He has done well, and I’m proud of him for weathering the crypto-winter.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:42:20
He didn’t do it on his own. He asked me to do it for him. So I buy it on his behalf. Also created a separate account for him on my Trezor. His coin is his and mine is mine for now. I also set up an “altfolio” for him using the Coincap app and I update it regularly so he can track the performance. And believe you me, the man checks it!
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:49:25
Yeah, he’s not thinking of this for himself. He loves his kids and wanted to take what for him was one of the biggest financial risks of his life. He ‘s always been frugal and careful with his money, bought never took risks. Bought low-yield savings bonds as a young man. NEVER invested in stock market. (That’s gambling in his eyes!) If he had just done mutual funds years ago he’d be a millionaire. So this cryptocurrency investment is a big deal. Even with the bear market he has killed it, which makes me so happy.
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:03:34
Ha! No arm-twisting. Love my dad, and my dad loves / trusts me, Am honored to carry out his wishes. and I send updates to both him and my sister, too. I always remind him that it’s his money and he can cash in some / all with just a phone call to me. But he’s a pure HODLER. Cryptowinter showed how strong his hands were.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:36:41
Oops ;)
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:10:05
Well-played! I think he also routinely misspells colour, centre and many other English words ;-)
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:10:47
I hold nothing in exchanges.
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:05:38
Ha! Couldn’t resist. Just had to give him some props. Feeling very grateful. I mean seriously, are there any other folks in this world who are moving in on 90 and buying cryptocurrency?!. There are millions and millions of nocoiner boomers, gen x-ers, and millennials, but this dude born well before WW2 is a multicoiner. Total baller.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:57:10
Great idea! Yes!
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:36:05
Ha! Already done. Look through comments. I wrote it out for those who can’t read runes.
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:17:25
Way to go!! A little can go a long way. I’m of the opinion that for every dollar invested in BTC today, you’ll eventually see a 10-fold
minimum to 100-fold max return. HODL like a boss!
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:14:40
He’s done very well, and all his btc is safely stored. I don’t touch his. Have my own.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:58:50
���� Good one!
@_date: 2018-11-09 12:46:59
I laughed heartily while going through the pictures! (The 0.00002 was brilliant.) Thanks! I always appreciate a little lightheartedness in Crypto. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:38:08
Wait just a dang second - you’re supposed to actually read Terms of Service? What a crock! We all know that it’s it’s just a perfunctory click so we can get on to doing what we want to do.
@_date: 2019-05-28 23:27:19
But that’s coming. I can now use bitcoin to buy groceries at whole foods via Flexa’s Spedn app.
