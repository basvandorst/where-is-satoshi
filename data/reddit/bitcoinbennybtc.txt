Exchange Wallets are showing significant outflows of crypto.  If this CEO/guy is alive authorities will find him and place him in his retirement cell for a lifetime.
This criminality needs to end.  Hold your private keys in [crypto wallet hardware]( or some form of cold storage!  Atomic swaps here we come!

Nothing is free.  Abra charges higher rates to buy and provides lower rates when selling, creating arbitrage opportunities internally. I’m okay with it, just don’t say it’s free.
Definitely nice that you can get small amts.
Not sure if you can get private keys off Abra if not that is a red flag for me.

I buy directly from my hardware wallet. I use the [Trezor Model T](  to buy directly from exchanges Changelly and Coinmama.   This way there is no need to take of exchange bc your never on it.
The hacks on exchanges now average $2.5M usd daily.  I don’t trust exchanges to have all crypto on hand.  keys.  Plus, their security on most does not include frequent penetration tests like large corporations.
