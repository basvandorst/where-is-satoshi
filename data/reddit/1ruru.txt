I wonder if Gamblers Anonymous takes BTC donations..

Do you know what a ponzi is?

Which is exactly what we need. Organic adoption.

It was one of the toughest whales I've ever fought. For all that despair, I broke even. Looking forward to the next raid sometime in 2017.  GG, Mechs, one of big three legends of bitcoin gambling.

No I'm not new. I probably have way more bitcoins than you. The last time I made a thread like this, we went down to $450 from $600. I realize this place is a huge circlejerk, but it would be helpful to lay off the kool aid once in a while.
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:24:24
Bitcoin did get hacked.. IIRC, billions of billions of BTC were printed back in the day, far surpassing 21 million. It was fixed asap, but still.
*184 billions. not millions.

If you can do better, go ahead. They grossly overvalued their company, and it's not doing well at the moment.
@_date: 2014-08-25 07:58:58
I may have looked into GA.. but I think it's for losers. I'm a net winner.
@_date: 2014-08-25 04:27:18
I'm different from the rest :)

We did tell him to stop though..

hmhm, I thought you bought bfls

I agree with kyle!

I specifically did not mention the name of the site since this is infact not an ad. I'm a customer at the site and just sharing my experience.
@_date: 2014-07-13 01:55:47
what did you buy?
@_date: 2014-08-25 02:27:11
What 'help' do I need, exactly? I won. Let me visualize the following GA meeting.
"Guys, I need help. I went to this gambling site and everything was going well. I kept betting and betting and then...... I kept winning over and over. I can't lose!'
Derp. Gambling is only a problem when you lose. We're all pretty much gamblers here, don't you think? We're all betting that our $500 bitcoin investment would make us rich. I refuse to believe that we're here to help Africa or to make the other third worlders life less miserable. ooh kumbaya!

I won a further 1.7 coins. I found an amazing strategy :)

What are you doing here then?

Damn.. this is like finding one of those WW2 grenades and have it blow up infront of your face.. in 2014.
So, what will happen to OP's money? It would royally suck if it gets liquidated and pays for the bankruptcy proceedings.
@_date: 2014-05-29 22:47:50
Oh why thank you!. The program I used (Audacity) does not respond well to increasing the volume. 
The ambient noise becomes unbearable and increasing the volume through the piano would simply be too loud so I had to compromise.
I found out that maxing the sound through the volume mixer works though.

Uhh the link was wrong. Check 
@_date: 2014-07-24 15:03:45
Wow it looks gorgeous.
@_date: 2014-08-17 15:46:10
We should post on r/malefashionadvice about bitcoins too!
@_date: 2014-08-25 04:27:42
Rest assured no coins were wasted. They even grew in number!
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:15:38
basically you start really low, spam a few bitcents worth.. then you bring the big guns. get the losses out of the way first.

Hey man, haven't heard from you in a while. glad you're okay. :) We will still have that dinner, right?

Umm, this may be out of topic, but how do you find old threads like this without clicking page after page after page?

Hello there, anon_bitcoin_gambler. I hope you're doing well. The Ura event is still on! :)
@_date: 2017-02-24 07:13:39
So.. is this the start of the slow strangulation back to $200, then rally to 1k 3 years later?
@_date: 2017-02-08 17:38:38
Um ok, so I was just cleaning my room, and I found this coin. At first, I thought it was an arcade token.. but upon closer inspection.. I instantly remembered I got one from a couple years ago and forgot about it.
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:41:09
I decided I'll keep it. Not selling.
@_date: 2014-07-04 10:51:51
He sent his coins after Mt.Gox closed. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:24:59
Yeah, it's been tried before. Remember Inputs.io?
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:55:16
So I'm a troll for pointing what's happening?
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:09:34
None. Because I wouldn't need BTC to get rich.
@_date: 2016-01-14 00:22:21
You guys are a bunch of hypocrites. Price jumps $10, and everyone wanks to the ticker. I speak the truth for a majority of you, and boo hoo, kumbaya.. BTC is there to fight the evil central bank.

It's a 2012 batch.. anyone know its worth?
@_date: 2016-11-04 00:31:14
I wonder what's the average cost base in this sub..
@_date: 2016-11-03 16:20:16
This is a repeat of 2013. Followed by 2 years of despair, and a subsequent rally in 2019.
@_date: 2016-11-23 08:29:21
I'd vouch for BK. The site is trusted, instant payouts and provably fair.
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:48:29
Okay, let's spin this to a pump:
"Satoshi returns to bitcoin." 
"The second coming of Satoshi Nakamoto"
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:03:47
Okay guys, so these transactions are fake. My take on this is SatoshiBit shorted BTC and wanted to incite panic. If we push the price up a bit, he'll get margin called, and we'll slay fake Satoshi this way.
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:06:10
He deleted his message. Here it is.

The 76% chance was for the 330 BTC bet to win 100. The 100 BTC bet to win 3 BTC was set at 96% chance of winning. You can pick your odds of winning. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:44:43
Uhhhh crash incoming?
@_date: 2015-07-16 09:58:27
bro, sorry to say but it seems that IGOT is a scam. Other people got scammed too dating back  2014..
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:04:47
 is a reputable casino from 2013 where you can park your bitcoins in, as well as gamble on a low 1% house edge.
@_date: 2015-07-18 09:15:51
It was 1% house edge. He was likely to win 100 BTC since his multiplier was 1.3x so, he had 76% chance of winning that bet.
@_date: 2015-07-15 22:51:03
This means it's time to get out of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-18 09:55:05
Also, Satoshi Dice sold for 11 million dollars. They won't go away for 30 coins, +1500 invested amount. Lol.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:22:34
You guys are awesome.
@_date: 2016-02-08 08:23:22
hate to be that guy.. how much is "A LOT"? I see people freaking out over a single digit coins.. It's hard to judge quantity here.
@_date: 2015-07-18 09:51:34
Bro, I think it's a glitch. Satoshi Dice isn't out to scam anyone. Email support and I'm sure they'll make you whole. Having said that, you're welcome at  with a lower 1% house edge. =) Hope this helps.
@_date: 2015-07-18 14:28:02
so ur balance is 0 now?
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:37:45
He came back two years later on a different site under the name 'starbuck'. He started with 300 coins, all the way up to 1309 before losing it all again. He isn't killing himself for losing it, in fact I had a feeling he wanted to lose it all. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:10:06
By the way, this chick predicted this current movement with insane accuracy: 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:32:24
Jesus fucking christ. Congrats man. Make multiple copies of that wallet.dat file, spread across many offline backups. Don't backup from the cloud. I think you have everything you need. Good luck!

Last night, someone claimed they found an excel file with private keys, containing 8400 BTC from 2009. The thread got 300+ replies before the owner deleted his posts. His account is still active though.
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:55:36
Sigh... I open two tabs. One r/bitcoin and one r/btc. It's really hard to parse this info when the two sides just flinging shit at each other. Maybe r/buttcoin will overtake both subs..
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:44:22
the "recovery keys" in your post could actually be private keys. Those can be used to reconstruct individual addresses with bitcoin balances. Those "passwords" might be the key to decrypt each wallet.dat I'm guessing.. You can check the balances of each address on 
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:08:20
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-05-25 11:40:31
It seems like you really hate casinos.. I wonder why. 
The house hedge exists as a form of margin --after all it's a business. Having no expectation of profit is pretty moot since the result is ambivalent in the long run, and no competent investor would fund this zero-profit business idea.
My take is you're trying to make a platform where it's a P2P system where a person wanting to make a bet sets the parameters from a specific outcome -- in your video, a sports game. What if say, the true odds are in fact, 60:40, then I set up a game where if either one wins, the payout would be 2x?? Aren't I profiting from a house edge, of ((1/.5)-(1/.6)) 33% ?
Even if you fool the masses from your "Zero House Edge", I highly doubt that the stigma would simply go away because of a lack of perceived house edge. Gambling is still a destructive vice. Sure, expected value is the same as your stake, but is expected value the only measure? There's standard deviation too. Would you bet $10,000 at 0.001% for a chance to win 10 billion dollars? Chances are you'd be broke by then even if this bet is +EV. You rarely see a lone gambler lose off of the house edge, (where wagered amounts x house edge = losses), instead you see them flat out disrespect kelly criterion and lose off of a martingale sequence. 
tl;dr this is a bad idea and it will fail. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:21:25
Face value at least. I think it's worth at least $3000 as a collectible. What do you think?
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:52:33
I think Gavin is compromised.
@_date: 2017-07-06 10:43:03
Ah yes. The golden age of dice. Don't feel too bad for mechs. He wanted to lose it back to the investors.
@_date: 2016-05-27 11:04:33
They didn't necessarily lost 2 million overall.. they could have hedged it somewhere else, where they gained 2 million dollars elsewhere.. Ideally you'd hedge by betting on something that have an inverse relationship to a BTC price rise.

I've known BetKing.io from 2013, when it was much more primitive.. and I can say that BetKing.io has gone far. Still waiting on PVP Poker tho.
