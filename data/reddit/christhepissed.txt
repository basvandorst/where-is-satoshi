I love these and only wish you could find a way to get the cost to make them down.
While the dream of Bitcoin may be to remove the middlemen completely, these (in my opinion) are the needed improvisations to really get it used by those who need it most - those without consistent electricity, internet, and education.
Have you done the calculations yet on how many you would need to get the price per note down to a fiat equivalent?

Jesus, you must've made a fortune to afford to go back in time and buy that paint job.
Seriously though, good going. A little effort and you have countless possibilities (so long as you're not in an HOA).

If you're concerned do a search of the originator and recipient addresses on a few block explorers. It sounds like you may just need to be a bit more patient. 
I would also suggest sending test transactions in the future to be certain you're setting them up correctly before the full amount.

If you're asking about the first part, it's to verify where the bitcoin is currently without relying on the wallet. It's possible that the wallet uses non-live sources as some sort of bandwidth saving measure or something.
If you're asking about the second part, it is indeed to verify the transaction addresses and fees are set appropriately.

We defiantly need these things along with signs saying "Bitcoin Accepted Here" to be as common as those Visa/MasterCard signs.

You can use ACH on Coinbase Pro and buy cheaper. You can also use things like Local Bitcoins, Local Coin Swap, etc.
These machines are very KYC compliant and force you to use their wallet app to transact in BTC. They're also confusing for customers. 
I was working on a bank ATM the other day and had to explain how to use this to a guy who got some from a family member (probably a drug deal in reality, from the look of him).
Anyways, I wouldn't trust this company or their ATMs while there were lots of other methods to get in or out of the market.

Go to CMC or whatever tracker you use and look at Tether's price. Been fluctuating between .92-.95. That's where the difference kicks in.

We can put a lot of theory behind who Satoshi is or was. The flexibility of anonymity means (as the chart says) even if someone *could* move some of the original sats it still isn't 100% that they are the or one of the original creators.
I like to think the creator(s) have other coins mined and are well off, and will never use the 980k. 
Do you think coming forward as the Bitcoin creator would be good for anyone?
He/She/They would be attacked by governments and sued by individuals and businesses as soon as the transaction completed. It's a shitty situation because people are shitty.
I personally hope we don't learn of Satoshi's identity until their death(s) or ever.

Severely underrated comment. Leverage is a drug, like coke or heroine. Sounds interesting at first and can make you soar.
Next you're alone on the arm rail of a high balcony. 
Be cautious, OP.

It seems like you could fit the Bitcoin logo against the road there

It's near the only BECU ATM in there if I recall, that should be more well known if you ask around.

If multi-layer options exist why not just as a superscript icon to the right of the BTC/LTC/whatever icon? I'm not a designer buy any means but it seems to me to be the easiest to implement and understand across languages. Similar to pic in op but gives more emphasis to the coin and not the layer.

The dollar has already lost 90% out its purchasing power.

You don't pay a fee for cigs and beer? It's just part of "adulting" before your an adult. 
The fees (insurance rates, credit cards rates, etc) normally go down as you get older, at least.

Just wanted to say first and foremost that you shouldn't trust any exchange, no matter how popular, with your crypto. Beyond that, with the introduction of negative interest rates and "bail-ins", you shouldn't trust any banks or credit unions, either.
With that all said, Coinbase will do what it is required by law for whatever jurisdiction you're in, and when you cross borders (even as arbitrary as a city/county line) the laws can change. Most of the time you won't get hit on actions alone, but reports from someone claiming authority over you.
I can attest to this because when my crypto journey started back in the day it was simply to play poker online, and I had used Coinbase for in and off ramps. Nowadays if I use it I move it right away, but I still know there's a risk and try to stagger amounts.
Finally, if you want to do something against Coinbase's Tos, just use another exchange. There are several available now.

So I've read through your responses here and you may need some advice my pops gave me about your age:
"If you wear shit colored glasses, all you're gonna see is shit"
You want to buy crypto but you keep coming up with reasons not to try anything other than your pops. You're going to find that life is full of hurdles and you won't get very far by just looking at them. 
So try the localbitcoins thing. Or Craigslist. I did a quick search and found something called localcoinswap that works over the web. None of it may be the golden toilet seat you're looking for, but you don't have to go all in right away, either. Maybe look to buy $50 worth at first and not risk the whole lot while you try to build trust.
I do think it sucks that you're 16 and getting cockblocked but when I was 16 I was still able to get beer and cigs, I'm sure there are still plenty of kids doing that as well.
