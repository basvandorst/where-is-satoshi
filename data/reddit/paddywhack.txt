IMO Wikipedia goofed by rejecting our pleas for them to accept BTC donations years ago. Every time I see that "If everyone donated $3" message I think to myself: No Jimmy, if only you accepted our damn bitcoin donations you wouldn't be asking us for money right now you idiot. They would have received thousands of bitcoins in donations just like Wikileaks did, but dumb-dumb was closed minded at the time.

This happened yesterday and it left a bad taste in my mouth while watching it.  The machine charged an approximate 12% fee.  The market rate, quote at that time was $486 CAD on CaVirtex while the machine charged the user $545.24. The members of the Canadian Senate immediately noticed this and chimed in while the guest speaker Kyle Kemper floundered to justify why they were leveraging such an enormous "convenience fee".

Not trying to argue, but just want to point out that you don't actually use the website to do your trading. The website UI was an afterthought, and more of a placeholder to show some light-stats and GPG-encrypted orders. Perhaps this was done deliberately to dissuade casual on-lookers who don't have the technical prowess to dive into such a complex trading engine?  But as far as I know, trading is done though a command-line.

Real answer?  Many large ATM manufacturers  (eg Diebold, NCR) don't encrypt traffic end-to-end, especially on older models. If you have access to the physical network (or access to the back of the ATM unit) you can install a hub and use Wireshark to intercept the back and forth communication. Watch how when you type your pin that it's transmitted in plaintext.. yikes. Then capture the ensuing response that tells the ATM you can withdraw money. Then POST that response back to the ATM and dispense free money.  Ideally using someone else's account info and not your own.

What is there to worry about? The parent company, Bitfountain, receives dividends on 236,038 shares every week.
For example, this past week:
1755.0502222 btc	 - 94415 shares
1755.0502222 btc	 - 94415 shares
877.53440544 btc	 - 47208 shares
Assuming the people involved with Bitfountain aren't greed driven assholes, they have an enormous amount of capital to re-invest into their business. Something the competition does not. That's significant leverage. 
Sure in the near term as other entities bring hashing-power online AM % dominance will drop, but I would almost guarantee they can turn around and finance the next wave of ASICs faster and in greater quantity than the competition.

One does not simply snap their fingers to make their current hashrate increase. AM is in the process of deploying a ton more hashing power in the near future.  They have the resources to re-gain a strong position (imo). Manufacturing and such, takes time.  
[Also, if you look at friedcat's latest post]( - a bunch of new model gen1 block erupter blades sold out.  And looking at today's dividend, 3234.63 btc of the 5602.29 total btc came from hardware sales alone.

CanadianBitcoins buys from CaVirtex . They have a partnership in place. 
Lets draw it out.
* Lightbox Technologies is the parent company. 
* Located in Ottawa. 
Within Lightbox is:
* Havelock Investments
* CanadianBitcoins
CaVirtex is located in Calgary
From the in person conversations I've had, Lightbox did the web development work for CaVirtex .
CanadianBitcoins charges a slight above market premium for their service. And a ridiculous sell premium, I'd personally never sell my coins on CanadianBitcoin unless I wanted to do an anonymous cash deal (they only allow you to sell 75 btc at a time, so it's limited). Also the sell price is somehow tied to that *Stability* value on the top of the page, which is some weighted average of how stable the price has been over some period of time. 
The REAL advantage to CanadianBitcoins, especially if you are living in Ottawa is that you can essentially lock in your price for 36 hours and sit and wait to see what happens in the market. For example, the other day I bought @ $38 and walked in the door with my cash when it was peaking around $48-$49, just before the market correction. At that time, I had profited $10 per BTC, that has since settled back down to the $43 or so it's at right now. 
I like this ability to buffer my buys with time. That is why I use CanadianBitcoins, I'm fully willing to pay a slight premium to lock in a price and use that 36 hour window to my advantage.

I invest $200 a week into bitcoin, have yet to sell.
Interesting anecdote, I was writing a card for my eight-year-old nieces birthday and was thinking of whether to toss a monetary gift in there as per the norm. A $20 bill or something, but then I had to laugh at myself and wonder what real value that "gift" has, so instead I decided to take a portion of my bitcoin holdings and put it in a separate wallet address as a "college fund". Let's see how far 100 BTC will get her in 10 years  :)

5% fee on the weekly dividend.
On a 1:100 share, that's a paltry 0.00001261 btc per share that ThickAsThieves earns.
That being said ... 
Your ego gives all the fucks in the world to validate your subjective reality you live in. That applies to everyone. Don't get it twisted. You wouldn't have gone through the motions to reply with an attack to my neutral post answering your question as to the motivation behind TaT's choices in leveraging a 5% dividend fee. 5000 real shares to a board seat.

Could a gov-coin cut a branch from the bitcoin source in github, modify it such that the miners are known, pre-determined and identifiable (centralized government mining) and any gov-coins mined have an "authenticity" to them in a similar way that all Canadian physical coins have *Dei Gratia Regina* imprinted upon them. 
It still maintains the benefits inherent of the protocol, but essentially becomes a Canadian branded alt-coin.
I realize this is a controversial idea, and one you likely cringed reading Erik. 
Just floating it out there, as I'm always one looking at what is within the realm of possibility. Not that I necessarily would want such a gov-alt-coin currency. However, this seems much better than Mint Chip.

I agree that everyone would need to run a client like Electrum in a scenario like we're describing here. 
The more I ponder (I'm all over the map today), the more I would like to find a way to take fundamentals from bitcoin and make a "bit-vote" system to improve democracy.  
For example: use the database from StatsCan to assign and mail (as in CanadaPost) each person a public/private key where they can use that address to cryptographically sign their vote on an election ballot. Obfuscate the complexities away from the everyday person and make the process as simple as approaching a touch-screen ballot station and scan a QR code representation of their key to sign their vote for representative X.

What I took away from reading that part of the article, and not to get extremist in this hypothetical scenario -- but -- if you wanted to undermine the entire bitcoin ecosystem you could assassinate the 5 key bitcoin developers which would cause a catastrophic erosion of trust, temporarily, on how to continue maintaining the github repository going forward, and who gets to control code commits, and future feature development, and bug-fixes, etc etc. It would certainly rally the community, but it would also open a massive opportunity to de-stabilize the entire bitcoin-experiment. 
**Disclaimer** I do not wish the aforementioned comment to be taken as my desire or personal intent, but to merely illustrate a scenario that is not entirely absurd or outside the realm of possibility.

Depends on what sort of volume of trading you are looking to do. LibertyBit has a shallower market at the moment so you may not be able to buy/sell at the most competitive price.
CaVirtex has the bigger volume, you pay a 3% transaction fee as opposed to 0.5% on LibertyBit. 
LibertyBit limits you to $500 per day. LibertyBit is Interac email money transfer.
depends what you are looking to do. but by no means is CaVirtex "awful" it's just the largest option with a slightly annoying fee.
