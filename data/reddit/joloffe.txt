They need to move it and reopen as quickly as possible. Every day they delay they reduce their chances of continuing as a business.
I think they should reopen and haircut everyone 20% - offer equity in the company in the form of a tradeable bond.
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:48:56
The best thing would be for the thief to anonymously return 1/3 or 1/2 the money.
Do it, guy.
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:20:49


I had virtually no bitcoins on the site, mainly USD and eth. Have a nice day you cunt.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:06:42
Relieved. Well done. If you pull it off then finex will prosper. 
Sort out the multisig arrangements..
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:54:56
I'd rather keep an extra 20% of my funds, all that opportunity cost and five years uncertainty, than be sure bitfinex hasn't screwed me out of 1%.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:12:22
They better hurry up and make an announcement..
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:45:52
As a previous USD lender on your site I am puzzled you seem to be singling out people like myself who have allowed the site to function with margin to your great benefit.
When another client borrows my USD and your site allows that client to say buy BTC/eth/etc/ltc, I as a lender know no details of the other side of the transaction or even which coin was purchased with it. I simply know the amount borrowed, duration of the offered loan and the interest rate per day of that loan. 
If the client who borrowed my funds and bought btc (which was then stolen from your site, and by extension, them)  actually they are liable to return the funds of the lender from their accounts - after all the coins are segregated in THEIR accounts. 
Margin users may lose more than what they have on your site. 
Margin borrowers should be liquidated to try and make swap lenders whole. 
What you are unable to cover that is left should be a haircut on USD lenders and either come out of equity in your company or require you to become insolvent.
Giving a haircut to usd lenders in preference to margin traders is unacceptable and impossible to justify.
please respond to this.

Compared to the goxing in 2014, things are getting better!
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:12:26
Go away..
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:51:21
Calm down. Unless they enter insolvency we get funds back.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:27:48
No surprise, someone is buying bitcoin, dumping eth and etc..i wonder who..
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:04:21
has no answer to this. Because he is simply trolling every bitfinex thread.
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:32:47
Most people will sell immediately.
I imagine it will be scooped up by speculators who expect finex to survive as ultimately it will be worth 70,000,000 in that case. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:13:42
If they took settlements in 2015 they could have bought far more.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:03:48
Yep..I am sure there numbers are out:
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:58:22
Worked for ethereum.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:08:32
except all assets of all creditors are liquidated into USD..
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:05:15
If you are restricting losses to bitcoin holders and usd lenders then you already have the details decided.
Lawyer up or offer some bloody good company equity.
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:16:34
@_date: 2016-08-12 19:47:15
Whereas you have sold yours..consequently wanting the price to crash?
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:05:27
yep, some insiders are going to do very well indeed out of this..only in bitcoin :-)
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:38:05
This seems likely.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:58:32
go away
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:52:00
I think if they haircut holders and offer equity in the company that seems fair (say 49%) then bitfinex could relaunch and become the strongest exchange in the world. 
Owned by the users. 
If the ownership of the company was a tradeable token even better.
The worst thing they can do is stall and force the userbase to pursue them in the bankruptcy courts. In that situation the company is dead and users lose almost everything. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:53:48
Have you bought some bfxcoin?

@_date: 2016-08-07 17:00:51
It is a high profile cybertheft in the global press and television media. And you think noone has reported the crime? Zane has openly said they have agencies investigating this.
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:26:12
When is that?
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:42:31
With what? They are 70 mill in the red

Not sure the hyperbole is necessary.
Withdraw dollars if you like.
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:32:05
I don't think you understand what limited liability means. There isn't enough money to go round to make everyone whole. All lawsuits do is force a larger haircut.
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:01:38
They are talking about equity in ifinex.
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:06:56
Nothing about someone stealing 70,000,000 USD worth of bitcoin from finex is fair. 
This is about the aftermath. We just want the biggest return of funds possible. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:28:44
Good luck getting a binding judgement for more than your actual loss, especially one in preference to other creditors.
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:56:02
How do you know?
Hint..: you don't.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:30:35
You should post this as a separate talk.
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:33:40
Incorrect. All asset classes take a 36% haircut to offset the btc theft.

He's an arrogant prick.
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:08:53
The hate in this subreddit towards coinbase is completely unjustified.
If you don't like them (and 4 million people do) then don't use them. 
It's a free country. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 11:45:45
Logic fail.
@_date: 2016-06-27 23:11:49
Sure buddy. The ecosystem wants bitcoin to be limited in both supply and usage!

Jesus just when i thought you couldnt get any worse.

Give it a rest. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 07:17:41
I just think removing a valid comment which disproved nullc's argument seems disingenuous. You knew precisely what it said and why it would be upvoted. That isn't moderation, it is directly altering the published facts in the thread to maintain a petty narrative. Poor!
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:48:41
If you are comparing coinbase and mt gox you are having a laugh. 
Coinbase is US based with huge VC funding and is forced to comply with KYC/AML (getting no end of grief on here from fools like you) and is insured against loss. They even offer a multi sig solution where they cannot take your funds. 
Gox was run by a fat frenchman who coded the entire site himself in PHP, ran a fractional reserve then tried to run with the funds blaming 'malleability'. Oh and he's going to jail. 
Coinbase is a brilliant company in the bitcoin ecosystem for new users and has been for years. Gox was a disaster which caught out even our glorious core development team. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 09:36:10
Nothing goes up forever, no matter the prevailing mood in this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-01-18 23:10:51
So you removed a citation which proved was wrong because..brigading?


And you wonder why this subreddit has virtually no actual discussion of anything current in bitcoin any longer. Sad really!
@_date: 2017-01-18 23:14:09
He thinks discussing what *he* thinks is right about bitcoin is a good thing. It's just heavy moderation, right?
@_date: 2016-11-24 07:09:24
When blockstream captured core development and stopped transaction growth..
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:38:35
Your posts are +18 here and -18 in the uncensored subreddits..funny that
@_date: 2016-09-26 21:40:22
Ever wonder who is funding blockstream?
@_date: 2016-09-19 17:56:31
Careful posting the white paper here. That isn't the current vision for bitcoin emanating from blockstream.
@_date: 2016-09-21 19:35:41


No it isn't. It also isn't live or close to being so on main net. 
After segwit triumphs the network will be able to cope with the massive 5 tps instead of 2-3 tps. The Core scaling roadmap (lol) is irrelevant.
@_date: 2016-09-19 17:55:09
Going to be interesting to see what you lot do when you realise bitcoin has squandered it's first mover advantage quite so spectacularly. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 21:35:55
How do you know?
@_date: 2016-09-26 22:09:05
Your hostility confirms it.
@_date: 2016-09-28 17:53:33
Of course you would, you are a bitcoin Core developer.
Plurality of implementations is only worrisome for those developing the client which accounts for the majority of the nodes on the monolithic bitcoin network.
@_date: 2016-09-21 22:04:11
No it isn't. Stick to the facts.
@_date: 2016-09-26 21:39:34
Ah. You are scared :-)
@_date: 2016-09-21 22:30:28
Christ, you can't even say it can you. 
Time to wander out of this house of horror for another few months.
@_date: 2016-09-21 22:17:59


But if we are sticking to the facts then it is actually less than twice as many.  Try and keep this honest please.
@_date: 2016-09-26 21:34:34
If the node count is a red herring then perhaps enlighten us what how exactly one measures decentralisation?
Next tell us how Core have assessed that with regards to the bitcoin network and objectively how that fits in with the current scaling roadmap. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 14:35:32
No working scaling improvements are likely for months, even if segwit is released today. All entirely predictable (and worse predicted, and let's not even talk about the economic idiocy of the 'fee market').
Your problem with arguing that et al. are committed to on chain scaling is that they have fought it tooth and nail, have chosen an overly complex route for this involving yet more unnecessary soft fork complexity, and still even today argue that 'bitcoin's natural state is to be run with full blocks' . 
Guess what, users don't want bitcoin with 3 tps and fees at 20c and rising, with a network that is unreliable. Businesses don't either, hence the pivot away from bitcoin. Next comes the users and then the exchange price unless Napoleon is dethroned.
@_date: 2016-07-13 16:38:04
When it was added in 2010 it was 10,000 times greater than blocks then.
We are beyond pretending keeping the limit in place is anything other than a political move at this stage.
@_date: 2016-07-23 20:31:47






You seemed to have skipped this bit
@_date: 2016-07-23 18:47:52
The cryptography in bitcoin, although elegant, hasn't changed except for speed optimisations since 2009. 
You keep appealing to authority and 'experts' for some reason. 
One does not need to be a developer to see the big picture. 
The fascinating thing about bitcoin is that the userbase are one remove from the network because they do not in general run nodes. They do invest the funds which drive the exchange price. 
The halving was great for the price but it papered over the cracks. Let's see what happens now :-)
@_date: 2016-07-20 15:34:39
Nothing centralised about a hard fork. In fact it is the precise opposite with the decentralised network as a whole deciding which fork to follow.
Stick to your job in the call centre.
@_date: 2016-07-20 16:50:17
Great bunch the  lot..
Pop in sometime, you might learn something.
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:56:08
Yeah of course that is a consideration (dunning Kruger effect), but if you can read and understand the white paper then you can understand bitcoin - this is big stuff not protocol minutae. 
The unlimited guys have done analysis on testnet showing that (with Xthin) most nodes can easily handle a blocksize &gt; 5mb (and I am adding a safe multimb margin of error).
Of course it is for the incumbent team to demonstrate the limits of the network and work towards that with a safety margin.
Where are the basic node specs published? Where are the bandwidth testing results for larger blocks with a network impact assessment? Rather than FUD where are the objective tests performed by the Core team to see what increases the network can stand before decentralisation is significantly impaired?
That's right. It hasn't happened. 
And you mistake my voice for being lone. The bitcoin 'intelligentsia' are absent from this subreddit.
@_date: 2016-07-20 14:45:27
Contrary to what a select few core developers and vocal mouthpieces in this subreddit would like the public truth to be, ethereum has demonstrated that a 'contentious' hard fork can be conceived and carried out with no loss of coins or significant market volatility in a matter of days.
Your move, bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-20 16:46:29
There is no difference between the fed and Gregory Maxwell deciding what the arbitrary limits for the network are this year.
The DAO caused the price volatility. The fork has been a success. I can see that and I don't even own ethereum.
@_date: 2016-07-23 12:25:16
Coinbase has pivoted away from bitcoin because a few bad actors at the heart of development have stalled on chain scaling. 
Like all of us they still believe in bitcoin. But enough is enough.
@_date: 2016-07-23 15:16:36
Guess what in a subreddit without free speech you have no idea what users think. 
The 'fee market' I was referring to is the one introduced by Core resulting in 'surge pricing' with a transaction cap - ludicrous.  Certainly not a part of Satoshi 's original design. 
Why not ask his views on the 1mb limit. You might be surprised to learn he thinks bitcoin will fail if it is ever lifted. The irony being the exact opposite is true.
Don't worry I probably have more bitcoin than you even after divesting 50%. It is the remaining 50% I worry about with the group think and complete lack of critical thought which has pervaded this space entirely.
Edit: 
Oh a few months may be extremely important. It is only very arrogant people who assume an outcome. You certainly have no idea what the market will do.
@_date: 2016-07-23 16:58:52
You can appeal to authority all you like. I believe in thinking for myself.
The fee market being pushed right now is not the actual original bitcoin design. Now fees are competing for limited blockspace. What was originally envisioned was that as the block reward exponentially decays, that rising numbers of transaction fees (and rising exchange values) in the context of growing block sizes (on chain scaling) would balance out.
The current 'competitive fee market in the context of limited blockspace' actually prevents miners from even being able to start the process of rebalancing their earnings from the block reward to transaction fees. Why? Ask the man smarter than you heading the project (who also creates off chain payment solutions..).
Oh and the btc market share as a proportion of overall cryptocurrency yesterday was below 80% and I think the lowest it has ever been. That is certainly not an awesome metric.
You have one thing right - disappointment with the leadership at bitcoin Core for (and it cannot be overstated) extremely poor project leadership in the last two years.
We agree neither of us can predict the future. But the market always wins and ignoring your userbase and investors is a sure fire way to lose every time.
