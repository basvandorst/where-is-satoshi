Actually i think i will make it U.S. and Canada - i just realized it would only cost me around $4 to ship 1st Class to Canada. Im also going to wait at least 24 hours before i choose someone.

Wow. Laptop right?
@_date: 2013-10-09 05:31:52
Could you explain a little more? I really dont understand why a bitcoin miner would be on a server.
@_date: 2013-10-09 05:23:13
Wow. And I was just thinking, i haven't heard a good USB hub gangbang story in awhile...
@_date: 2013-09-06 21:54:11
Sorry about that...i will change that.
@_date: 2013-10-09 02:16:44
What are you using to mine right now? CPU?
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:54:05
So it is eventually going to confirm?

Since cam51037 is the only one who submitted a video before the deadline - im declaring him the winner. If anyone doesnt understand bitcoins, definitely watch the video.
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:29:25
So, say they time out? What happens then? I just lose the coins? Now what i dont understand is, that on this transaction:
It has the fee paid, but when i try to spend those coins, i still get the "spends an input which in unconfirmed" error:
And how long does it usually take to sort out? If you add up both transactions im out about $450 right now...i know it isnt much to some, but i could really use it right now is why im so worried.

@_date: 2013-10-11 02:09:51
Thats awesome man! Yeah, let me know how that goes!
@_date: 2013-10-09 02:42:57
Hmm...interesting, anyway that you could do a youtube video explaining if you won the contest?
@_date: 2013-10-13 05:45:11
Im starting to think i should make the contest a bit longer..
@_date: 2013-09-06 21:54:55
If you go to the bottom of the tutorial, i am offering free bitcoins to anyone that sends me a screenshot with your new wallet!
@_date: 2013-10-10 05:40:34
I think i have chosen a winner, it is not final yet...but im not taking any more submissions. Thank you everyone for playing - i will be announcing the winner shortly.
@_date: 2013-09-06 06:42:23
Next i think ill be making a tutorial on how buy bitcoins with BitStamp or MtGox
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:08:32
You know what, PM me your bitcoin address, ill send you the bitcoins, also remember, he never asked for the bitcoins or anything for that matter because it was a contest and he was paying for the shipping, it was your idea to send the bitcoins, so im not sure it appropriate to label him a "scammer" since he never asked for anything or even hinted at asking for anything. And im sure he sent the miner, and if he didnt, he has had alot on his plate the last two weeks and im sure hes still going to. If i knew where it was, i would ship it out myself.
So send me your bitcoin address, ill send you the bitcoins back, and PLEASE be patient, you will get the bitcoin miner, there is no need to be calling people scammers when they are giving away free stuff.

Oh and the memory is still available!

So i just got a couple of emails from blockchain.info:






Now if i try to spend these coins, am i going to have the same problem?
@_date: 2013-10-09 04:41:48
Where are you studying at?
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:50:38
They both showed up as if i had coins in my account, but when i try to spend it, i get a "this transaction spends an input which in unconfirmed":
And here is my other transaction i tried to spend the coins:
