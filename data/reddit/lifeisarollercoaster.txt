Lots of coins were lost when bitcoin was not so valuable. It was just a fun new fad at first. So anything on old computers or old hard drives that were discarded or went bad or just simply deleted will be lost forever. I am sure I have erased old wallets without a care. Even now such things can happen but it’s far more rare as everyone knows how to take care of it. 
My point was it will never hit 21 million but a maximum number lower than that

Technically once it hits the maximum number. Shouldn’t it keep decreasing constantly due to lost coins? 
So once it reaches max it will keep getting rarer. 
And the max will be less than 21 million due to coins already lost

Why are they only traded against BTC and not USD?
Is it also that they don’t trade against each other?
Doesn’t this make owning any of the other coins pointless

The use of comma as a decimal point is mildly frustrating. Most English speaking countries use the dot and so does all computer languages. But Wikipedia confirms that more countries use the comma. Weird conflict. As a species we can’t even unite under a standard for numbers

These posts are stupid. BTC is supposed to be about acceptance and usage and not price speculation. There were no reasons for this rally other than some guy buying $100 million worth of BTC. It will soon die down. Clap for stupid posts

Are you able to answer the question? It's fine to be critical but neither you nor the OP above have mentioned what are the flaws

Bloated is standard for most MS software but it is also extremely feature rich. You may prefer to use what you want but I am not seeing any real flaws in your reply. I have been using VS and other IDEs and VS with Intellisense is way out ahead of everyone else in terms of capability. VS is THE main reason why it is so easy to learn and work with MS software.
