Not sure if it answers your question. Because of bitcoin I've bought quite a bit of stock of MGTI. They are the largest bitcoin mining operation in the west of the world, and just did an order TODAY of 1000 s9 antminers. They will be doing 1.1 million worth of coins (current value) by October. Cheap stock too. They have went up 108 percent in the last 20 or so days.

From all here, the lost coins you refer to are the ones stolen that I saw in the documentary?

I tested this theory, sure enough, 10 downvotes and 1 gold.

It's only a gain if you cash out. Gains are profits, profits are taxed. What does holding for a year have to do with anything?

The only thing I was thinking too.  That is the call of a man who carries heavy bags.

So you get taxed to hold.  My god.  There are zero taxes here.  Only on gains when realized.

Yea to close that he would have to buy quite a bit to cover.  I don't use bitfinex but there would have to be a spike.

70% of people lose money day trading.  Little less for swing traders.  If you really just want to hodl, invest in index's.  If you want to go to the moon, invest in AMD and MGTI.  And of course, BTC.  
Edit:  WSB is leaking.

Pretty sure they don't have crypto currency numbers in their guidence because it's hype and a fad. AMD did the same thing. Priced in.

You do not use stop losses on an extremely volitile market. You would be eaten alive.

All I could [think of](
You could meme this and say the difference of bull/bear.  :D

Agreed.  But he will just take his business elsewhere.  Their loss.
