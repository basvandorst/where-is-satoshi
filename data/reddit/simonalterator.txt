I’m not sure I see the connection? Why does something having value primarily for its users mean that is has zero value?
Because a road provides value primarily to those who drive on it, it therefore has no value at all?
Because a book provides value to its readers, it therefore has no value at all?
Because euros are primarily used by Europeans, they therefore have no value at all?
It seems counterintuitive to me to expect value from something without engaging with it.
To your second point; If you can see through the memes and infighting, you’ll see that crypto currencies are being regularly transacted for a constantly growing list of goods and services, as well as being used for investment - just like ‘real’ money. 
Having said all that, you will most likely be getting some value from crypto even if you choose not to engage with it, because at the absolute worst, the underlying tech will be abstracted and used as the basis for the next wave of electronic banking tech, as evidenced by the significant r&amp;d investment coming from banks and other large conglomerates (axa etc).  Because of crypto’s immutable nature, having investments in crypto could be thought of as equivalent to having de facto ‘stock’ in any company engaging with it (or built on it) as well.
That’s my understanding anyway, I completely recognise I could be entirely wrong or missing the point. I am certainly not an economist or even an investor. Just someone who is interested in the tech and excited to see what’s in store for the future :)

My understanding is that the network is the value, in addition to all the other properties/abilities it affords (anonymity, deflationary, etc).
Owning 'BTC' is the same as saying you own part owning a part of the BTC network, which, according to metcalfe's law has value proportional to its number of users, just like any other network.

Ease up turbo! This is clearly a kid you're talking to who has gotten $200 for their birthday and put it toward something they see other people excited about and they want to be excited too. 
They've acknowledged they are in over their head, and now they are reaching out to a community who holds the knowledge they're missing. I know when I was younger I did plenty of the former without the wisdom to do the later.

In that case I'm stumped. Get in touch with their support maybe? I'm sure they are slammed after today, but still worth doing.

Everyone was a newbie once. Even if they arrive with dollar-signs in their eyes, lots of them will become valued members of the community as they get their heads around the tech.

If you're seriously interested in doing this, it might be worth your time reading up on arbitrage in the context of financial markets (eg:  This is a serious thing that people really do. You'll probably see some chatter on the sub right now about a big arbitrage opportunity between USD/BTC and the Korean Won that might take a little while for the market to automatically correct.
It's a nice idea in theory, but it tends to be an awful lot of work in practice.

Or in (slightly) more digestible numbers, you could spend $450,000 every day for 100 years and still have spare change.

Hey! I've had a prototype laser cut, but I haven't gotten around to assembling it. Totally swamped by the holidays :). Looking to make some more progress when the studio I'm working with opens back up in January. Thinking about putting a quick kickstarter together or something over the next week or so to facilitate a group buy if anyone's interested.

As far as I know there's a different rate for buying on credit vs. buying from a bank account. Could that be the difference?

Good on you for putting this together. We've all got to remember that crypto is still in that odd growth phase where the tools aren't mature and the learning curve for newcomers who want to do things right isn't necessarily easy. Short practical guides addressing specific topics like this are a great community resource.

Go easy on yourself, friend. It's not wrong to have a moment of hesitation or consideration before making any choice. Your actions are what really count. There will be plenty of days to hodl your coins, but today you hodl your goodboye.
