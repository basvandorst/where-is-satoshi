You wrote it down... Atleast it is what every wallet tells you to do.

Eric Schmidt said this back in 2014... I don't know why it is trending back up all of a sudden.

This guy responded to their questions so well... Impressive considering how young he looks.

I placed a little amount back in summer 2016 when it was at ~800$. I'm still profitting.
People don't understand "long term", they're too impatient or failing with their day trading.
Good luck.

If you bought bitcoin three months ago and hodl, you'd still be in the positive.
If you bought a year ago then there's no way you can go negative.
That's how it works. Not luck based. LONG, TERM. Day trading is dumb.

Or are you immature for saying this?
Ask yourself these questions : 
Those who placed money on BTC a year ago when 1BTC = 1000$ (even less) and are still holding today, are they "rekt"? No, it is now at 3000$+ and counting anyway.
Are they placing only spare money they can afford to lose, otherwise "rekt"? Yes, and that is always advised. 
Are you "rekt" because you never understood the bitcoin and probably panic sold the money you placed at some point? Most likely. Or you never placed anything so now you are sad because you can't afford it.

Pretty sure that is not allowed on this reddit.

Obviously a bug on their end.

Nice, you learned. Just hodl and never panic sell.
