I've been watching the Bitcoin price closely for a couple of years now and my conclusion is that sometimes the price goes up and sometimes the price goes down.

@_date: 2019-08-28 13:05:21
is there maybe a premium on bars that have credible branding on them?

@_date: 2019-04-08 17:46:24
Yeah why even bother hoarding btc at that point
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:23:57
While I don't think this is entierly why you gotta keep in mind that not all bitcoin are available for purchase at all times, the sellers pool is just a fraction of what is out there.

Unless there's smoke coming out of your miner it's not unsafe, it's just air that's been warmed. If there is smoke coming out of your miner though you should probably turn it off and check your warranty, cus dat aint supposed to be dat way.
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:34:41
