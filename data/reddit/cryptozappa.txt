Network effect alone likely won't keep bitcoin as the number 1 crypto forever. Remember when Myspace was slow and wasted energy, what everyone did?

I want to see if people think coins with faster blocks will be a threat to bitcoin in the future?

Who says a coin in the future would have to be less secure to be faster?

Whether other cryptos are slightly more lighter, durable, and efficient or much more so than bitcoin, before wider adoption of crypto happens, I think the masses will go with a better coin. Right now the only thing you really need to use bitcoin for is to buy drugs and gamble, crypto hasn't even started yet.
Maybe bitcoin can sidefork its way into competing technologically forever though.

Yeah and AOL had a good run too.

Definitely, and that's a good thing. Though certain libertarian policies people find more palatable will gain traction.

yea with that reddit name no bias there

Network effect is bitcoin's main selling point right now. There are already energy efficient, faster, and arguably more secure coins out.

Proof-of-Stake, as in not needlessly wasting energy redundantly mining.

If you replace the word "bitcoin" with "fiat" and "Ultramegaduperultradopecoin" with "bitcoin" you're making the same exact argument for why bitcoin can't succeed.
When currency is based on technology, the Myspace analogy is all the more apt.

Remember Myspace (slow, energy wasting)?
