That's what I was wondering too. $100 million usd worth a day seems unlikely. That would be $37,500,000,000 per year. Global organized crime generates just under $900 billion per year. So btc would be 4% of that, I don't think so. 
Illegal activity could also be shifting money illegally (like the Chinese) from country to country using btc.
Also, if someone was to eat there own dick on live TV, would they be sedated? Would the guy eating his dick be the one cutting off his dick? I'm not sure anyone, including Mcafee has really thought this through, seems like something that would require lots of planning and legal issues so you don't end up in a mess like Der Metzgermeister.

Nope, I still hold my some of my forked bch. Didn't say I hate bch. I'm a member of r/btc and r/bitcoin  and other 'shitcoins'. At this point I really don't care whether bch or btc succeeds, I'll just follow the crowd and whichever coin gets mass adopted first, might be a 'shitcoin', don't care. I'm not a fan boy or favor any one coin over another.

That could be exactly what he's doing. Bch could've been still at $300 or less. Roger might have seen a lucrative opportunity and he took it. A $100 million opportunity is hard to decline I admit I probably would've done the same, whatever he did, if I had the chance.

Difference between pot stocks and crypto is that crypto prices are led by global demand while most of the run up in prices of stocks like Tilray are due to Canada legalizing marijuana soon. Speculation focused on the success of one market is far riskier. They say they will export internationally but there's not much demand for expensive imported marijuana.
Most potheads in Canada already get cheap weed illegally, don't know if they're going to pay a premium for fancy weed extract as they'renot exactly the affluent type. Nor will they have any success scaling and getting more people to smoke.

@_date: 2018-09-26 13:32:04
I get what your saying and sure it can scale but it won't be easy. It's not like a new iphone or food product where anyone's a potential customer. Personally I don't care about drug use but there are people who are still opposed to it morally or for whatever reason so they still might not buy it even if it's on a store shelf. 
Yeah Bitcoin and crypto is pure speculation but it has a much greater potential customer base. I don't see every other person smoking weed but I do see every other person one day using crypto.

I think I read once that they already have paid it off but who knows for real. However, it was still wrong that taxpayers had to pay for banksters' mistakes while they got away scot-free. The banksters did not have an opportunity to learn from their mistakes pre 2008 so it runs a risk of emboldened banksters making more, even larger mistakes in the future and the government might not be able to bail them out a second time.

The tactics they used to take advantage of homeowners to increase their own profits were considered illegal, yet they were paid off when their tactics failed.

Bitcoin ATM's or BTM's, have high fees too. Used to be able to link Canadian bank accounts with Coinbase with a fraction of a percent fee until they removed that service and it's now credit card 4% fee. 
I still do Coinbase personally, it's instant but there's a weekly limit of 1000. I just move it into a trezor from Coinbase thereafter.
BTW, I once visited 3 different BTM's in Toronto and they were all out of order. Don't know if I was unlucky that day or high BTC volume.

This is exactly it. Lots of people including those who have a bigger voice were capitulating and saying we were in for a possible multi-year bear market. 
Never short BTC. With tradional stocks you can gauge the strength or weakness of a company with their progress reports, earnings reports, even insider information (illegal but still widespread). You simply cannot do this with BTC because it is intangible. BTC does not care, it is volatile and it will rip you to shreds if you're not careful.

No but seriously bro, don't just randomly message people, open a store like on Openbazaar or something. You could accept BTC there. And post stuff people actually want or need not another slogan t-shirt or mug or metal art print. Start off locally. See stores near you with high perceived value which you could make a profit on if you sell online after shipping costs. Post the item, don't even buy it yet see if anyone's interested first. They buy it. Go out and buy the item from store, ship, rinse n repeat. Test the market see what people like and get the hang of retail arbitrage then buy from other places like aliexpress. Then alibaba. Don't dropship. Stay ethical. Satisfy every customer.
