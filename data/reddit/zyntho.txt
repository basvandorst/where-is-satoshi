From a user standpoint, the only thing BCH is missing is adoption in stores and users, but the technology is probably going to have much less user adoption in the future, because of big block sizes. 
Bitcoin is running from miners and nodes. You get paid nothing for running a node, and now a BCH block is 8x bigger than a BTC block. People theorize that this would eventually lead to centralization, with few nodes being run by the elite, rather than anyone, like today. 
Bitcoin adds upgrades and features through nodes, and seeing if the network agrees. People essentially votes with these. If "the elite" already controls most of the nodes, aswell as most miners, bitcoin has become centralized.
Personally i think that 8MB blocks arent that much of a problem, and it wouldnt be a bad thing if BTC increased the blocksize a little bit. R/bitcoin is really negative about it, and is biased, like myself, in that theyre holding BTC.

Asking critcal questions about LN has gotten 2 of my previous posts removed, its really annoying, and its a real thing. Add open mod-logs pls
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:50:41
It was a bottleneck that now needs to be solved. Right now the "blocksize" is around 21MB. Blocks arent even 1MB now, so every 1sat/b tx should get through right now.

Do you have a link to the tone part? I only catched the " i hate businesses using BTC" part live, which sounded absurd. Livestream was really choppy.
Its the equivalent of saying:
"I really hate businesses using the USD, selling them for other goods and services, its hurting the ecosystem"
Id love to hear his proper explanation for that argument, if anyone got a link. :)

Isnt that specifically aimed at orphaned blocks? Thats how i took it atleast.
I dont think the whitepaper mentions chainsplits at all.
@_date: 2018-09-11 03:11:20
Im with you bud, but LN doesnt really work as money, as liquidity is needed to participate in the network, and routing is still an unsolved problem.  I dont have the answer, but i have my eggs in both baskets just to be safe.
You should check out ryan x charles video on bigger blocks and decentralization.  He worked with payment-channels long before LN, and has a lot of insight.
@_date: 2018-09-11 01:02:41
Why are you spreading blatant misinformation?
ViaBTC (Partly funded by bitmain) is at 2nd/3rd, depending on rawpool. Antpool is currently at 5th with 6% hashrate.
CG has been in the top for months. 
Both coinbase and bitpay have payment portals for businesses accepting both BTC and BCH. 
I get that people here dont like BCH, but stop lying to yourself to feel better. Im on both chains, and the biases in this sub is unreal. See the world through your own eyes, not through the sentiment in this sub. Im just trying to be objective.
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:24:44
The point im trying to make is that "what is/isnt bitcoin" Is just arguimg semantics at this point.

@_date: 2018-09-11 13:48:56
0-conf works if you turn off RBF, but you also need to get into a block. If you pay 1sat/b, and sit in the mempool for 2 weeks, and is rejected because all blocks are full, does it really work?

Haha i know i might sound kinda dumb here, but you hear Andreas A. Talk about how money is a social construct.
 For most people, BTC is bitcoin, for others its BCH. I think rogers point is BCH works as money, while BTC doesnt, as it is slow, and can be expensive at times. 
It is a bitcoin fork, and is therefore a version of bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-09-11 02:50:34
What im saying is that the argument about semantics are dumb, yes. Both Ver and Song used these. 
100MB blocks is a non-problem. That would be about 5TB a year. If you think the chinese government will gain control because miners cant afford to buy one harddrive every year, you're wrong. 
Read the LN whitepaper. It proposes a blocksize of 133MB.
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:03:09
I understand what youre getting at. Let me ask you this. November 2017, BCHs hashrate exceeded BTCs hashrate for a short time. Was BCH Bitcoin at this point in time?

@_date: 2018-09-10 23:30:19
I dont think anyone would market dump tbh. Idk though, but it would potentially destroy the entire  BCH ecosystem, something neither of these parts want.
If Wu dumps SV, Nchain and CG would dump ABC, leaving both essentially worthless. I dont know how liquid Bitmain is in terms of fiat, but 1M BCH is nothing to laugh at, and seeing theyve moved most of their BTC to BCH, i dont think they can risk the losses of that happening.

I would agree that wallets need security and trust. Can you tell me why BCH removes that? 
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:52:39
It depends on network traffic. Right now any will do, as fees are relatively low, but BTC is the most expensive when the network clogs up. 
In terms of transactions per second they rank like this. (On-chain)
BTC &lt; ETH &lt; BCH
(4-7) &lt; (10-30) &lt; (128-224)
Fees are generally lower the more transactions per second are processed, but it might not matter right now, as very cheap transactions are getting through anyway, as network traffic is low.

@_date: 2018-05-20 15:23:04
Just because you dont need BCH integration doesnt mean other people agree. don't be so narrow minded. They're one of the innovators/developers that make this scene work in the first place.
They probably don't care about your personal needs, but care more about market demands. You namecalling talented developers because they fill another market than what you personally are interested in is just dumb, and solves absolutely nothing.
If its so god damn important to you do it yourself. They have the freedom to do what they want, and you demanding that they should do what YOU need, and should stop doing their "WORHTLESS SHITCOIN!!!" is just plain childish. Grow up.
free markets and booming innovation is what makes this space "better", and restricting that is just stupid. if they don't want to do it, someone else will.
The worst thing is that they're actually working on it, trying to fix your problem. you're just sitting there namecalling just like an inconsiderate, impatient child.
@_date: 2018-05-21 23:35:47
Either i dont understand, or this is a dumb argument. The "attack" is to make expensive Txs while the defense of such an attack is also expensive Txs? How did the fee market defend btc? 
If such an attack were to happen to BCH, it would be 32x more expensive. The "fee market" exists on both chains, I just still dont understand how its a good thing to have higher fees. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:40:08
LN can be done without Segwit. Can you explain what you mean by the fee market?
BCH has consistently 1sat/b transactions. is that a bad thing?
I'd have no problem with asicboost as long as it wasnt a patent. This is a problem with our laws, systems and state, and not the BCH protocol.
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:03:49
The most PoW is aquired by having the highest hashrate. Miners want to make more money, so they mine the most expensive chain. 
Price is a factor based on public opinion, or demand, something that can be (and i think is) manipulated. BCH gained 9% on BTC today, and it would be rational to assume that the hashrate would follow. I don't really like roger ver, but am a fan of BCH.
Downvote me all you guys want, but i feel like there is a narrative being pushed that BCH is bad because of Roger Vers antics. We should attack the tech, not people. 
"BCASH is bad because it advertises itself as bitcoin". It doesnt, Roger ver does this. "Bcash is a fraud because it is fooling new people." This is again done by users of the BCH protocol, and not BCH itself. 
Its like telling people to not use the internet because scammers are using the internet.
I would just love for people to have fair discussions without all this shitslinging we see on cryptoreddit or twitter.
From my point of view, the BCH community have a huge focus on adoption, and has more capacity in terms of Tx/s. I believe that BCH will achieve a higher adoption because of this and the lower fees. If this happens, price will follow, making miners mine the BCH chain for higher profits, making the BCH chain have the most work. 
It is a race of adoption, and we will see if LN is able to outrace BCH. Ln does have a pretty high barrier of entry, with always online LN nodes and funded channels and everything, slowing down adoption further. LN is cool, if they manage to get it to work effectively.
@_date: 2018-08-27 11:28:40
There kind of is, if you install bitcoin core, and eclair on top of it. You have to edit some files in wordpad, but its relatively simple if you have a tutorial. 
Try this: 
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:16:54
It is the same tech as BTC, except that the blocksize cap was heightened again.
Other people might be aggressively advertising BCH, but that has nothing to do with breadwallet. If its an attack or a blessing only depends on your viewpoint. If you held BTC before 1 aug. You got both, and if either wins, you'll win. 
"Trick users into adopting it" is basically any advertisement ever. BCH is easier to adopt, both for stores and users, because of the low fees and higher throughput. This is a fact, and not an attack. 
LN doesnt work properly yet because the network needs to grow to work efficiently. There are also higher barriers of entry, like always online nodes, funded payment channnels, and routing difficulties. 
Because of this, BCH is a fair alternative, as long as BTC refuses to increase the blocksize.
It used to be we, but turned into us vs them. I assume this is because of people that bought after it took off in 2017.

I dont want to accuse you, but it would be cool to have a discussion about this. We all have certain biases, and i want to know why you think its a scam? 
Its almost the exact same code as BTC was, and works the same way, and given to every BTC private key.

@_date: 2018-05-22 00:03:36
Is bch more vulnerable because the hashpower would leave the network? Remember that BCH adjusts difficulty after every single block, and not after every 2016, like BTC. This would somewhat reverse fleeing hashpower, as difficulty would go lower, making it more profitable again. 
Also isnt this only a problem with 0-conf payments? 0-conf should only be used in small payments, that are not worth to spend energy on double spending. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:34:18
Doesnt bch have a "fee market" in that sense, except there is not enough demand to bring prices up? 
I dont know what attack you're talking about, but are you referring to the "almost flippening" event that happened last fall? It made BTC expensive to attack, but also expensive to use, and hashpower were fleeing to BCH as coin price rose. 
An increase in blocksize cap could also make attacks more expensive, if this is the kind of attack you're talking about. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 10:10:32
"It" cant do that as "it" is just a protocol. Actors using BCH advertises BCH as bitcoin. Say what you want about these people, but they are not Bitcoin Cash.
BCH and BTC have the same origin, and the claim to the bitcoin name is a fair argument. I would prefer Bitcoin Cash, to provide clarity in a relatively new and confusing market. 
Again these are just people with beliefs that doesnt align with yours. They arent scams, but the hostility and mob-mentality of crypto makes actual discussion almost impossible.
Its not like Bitcoin is intellectual property.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:00:34
Its not run by ver. Its not run by anyone. Just like BTC. People need to understand that. Ver and CW support BCH, just like you support BTC.

We wont have a use for bitcoin if its only traded. adoption by users and market vendors is the main thing we should work towards. 
IMO, if there is no "usecase" and its purely being traded for value by institutions its just a ponzi.
usecase is what should give it value in the first place, and not purely speculation.
"ill buy, and get others to buy, so that price goes up"
this is basically what is happening as long as people aren't actually using it as a CURRENCY.

Bigblockers were a thing before 1 aug. Please tell me why BCH is a scam. Just because it doesnt align with your beliefs doesnt make it a scam. 
Its just a protocol, like BTC is. The internet isnt a scam, even if scammers use it. I would really like people to understand this. 
BTC currently has problems, and LN or BCH are possible solutions to solve scaling, and not a scam. People should realize this and not yell at each other like children.

wont this easily be abused? if fees are less than 0,5 sat per TX, and you can make 0,5 sat by cheating the system. 
it may be possible as long as fees are never less than 0.05 sat, and 20 hops are a requirement
can you explain more?
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:36:14
Can you elaborate on why you think it failed on a fundamental level? I understand that we cant increase blocksize forever, but there is nothing stopping second layer solutions, similar to LN, to appear on BCH.

I just cant see the problems with only a 2x increase. 
BCH just did an upgrade to 32MB without problems.
I realize these projects are different, but we should have no problem using 2mb blocks with todays tech, let alone the future. 
Id like to hedge my bets in case BCH doesnt work. Im holding both, and will do for a while. If either of them win, i win. For the higest probability of BTC winning, i think at least a 2X increase is needed, and seeing the door closing for that opportunity, with LN being already being buildt on top of the 1MB BTC is just kinda worrying i guess.
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:04:05
How is that a nonsense phrase? Would anyone buy bitcoin if it was controlled by one party alone? Hopefully not, as decentralization of hashrate makes "rules" unbreakable, and is an important part of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:47:26
If all the hashrate leaves the network for nodes with another consensus rules, it wont matter?
@_date: 2018-06-30 14:00:23
Is this because nodes will be cheaper? Wouldnt this lead to a "cheap" network that is too expensive for anyone to use? Hard drives are not expensive, and in december i spent more on tx fees than the cost of a 1TB harddrive.
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:52:07
Not exactly "just because", but before LN is fully fleshed out, nobody wants to pay high fees. Merchant adoption has been declining because of this, which is pretty serious. 
As stated above, i was fairly ignorant when it all happened, but am i correct in that the S2x fork had miner consesus, but was still canceled? 
Can we achieve that consensus again, and upgrade before LN
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:55:35
Ehh. Im not really in the digital gold camp tbh. I feel its usability is what gives it value to begin with. If youre not using it as currency, youre just hoarding 1s and 0s in a distributed database. 
That has little to no value to me personally. I think holding gold is also kinda stupid. I might be the idiot there, but thats just my thoughts. 
If its not used in commerce, i feel its just kind of a ponzi, where everybody buys, because it will be worth more, but has no usecase that its buildt on. I dont think that market sentiment will end well.
If you came with enough gold coins to a store, theyd eventually sell you most things, as gold has been a popular medium of exchange, and also has other usecases that the seller could exploit/profit from. 
The only characteristic BTC shares is the "store of value" which i think is kinda bullshit without the "medium of exchange" part.
@_date: 2018-06-30 20:55:59
A 0,3MB block size would limit BTCs functionality, which is already low.
In your planned system we're just doing the bartering system all over again. Ill take 3 chickens for your goat.
What do you think would happen if every store stopped accepting the USD, because trading goats, eggs or milk directly is much cheaper, and makes more economic sense? 
I really doubt theres a way this system will achieve merchant adoption.
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:21:12

Why does it need more nodes in the first place? I thought the only ones needing to run full nodes were miners. Cant everyone else use SPV nodes?

How about 51% attacks? Isnt bitcoin "the chain with the longest proof of work?" According to the whitepaper?
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:34:04
Im currently running my own node on the BTC network, and is still in favor of a chain that is usable as money. I really doubt a bitcoin with 300k blocksize will achieve that. 
Opening and closing LN channels still needs blockspace, and i was wondering if a 2x upgrade should be done, so that we can hopefully have a higher adoption of LN.
Imagine this scenario, that could possibly happen.
LN is done, but routing is a challenge, as not enough nodes are in the network, with sufficient funds. Users are discouraged from setting up nodes, as it costs a lot to fund channels, and since LN is kinda wack already, its not worth the setup costs.
Expensive to use BTC would lead to slow adoption of LN, which would make LN worse, and make more users flee to other crypto currencies, something we're already kind of seeing. BTC has lost a lot of market dominance during the last year.

No, you dont own a nicehashwallet. Nicehash pay you automatically from their wallet to the wallet you paste in the nicehash client. Once they pay you, you can do whatever you want. 
I think what you call a nicehashwallet is essentially what they owe you. You cant really do anything until they pay you, but once they do you can do whatever.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:34:01

Bitcoin still has to prove itself, and has ways to go to become a usable payment solution.

2. Non-custodial LN requires an always online node to send and recieve payments. I'm also dependant on other peoples channels being filled if i dont have a channel with my counterparty, and channel liquidity is very low, only allowing micropayments. 
The LN UX is not there yet, and even when if it gets there with watchtowers and everything, LN will only work with micropayments consistently anyway, as long as im supposed to go through multiple channels.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:30:06
Not really. There are many alternatives, and most of them scams. You could do an altcoin that uses "Proof of stake" that would increase your holding over time, but the altcoin might tank, or bitcoin may rise over it Etc. Etc.
Im looking forward until the Casper upgrade to Ethereum, which would allow this using at least 10 ETH. (I hope). But again ETH value is not stable to BTC value.
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:34:44
With so high tx fees, no one would use BTC. If this does not get fixed quick, BTC will lose the race to BCH or other currencies
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:14:06
Its ok, not optimal. But this will only get worse as the use of BTC will grow. Growth of use might stagnate because of it aswell.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:50:12
"The people who control bitcoin" is everyone. Once people disagree on a solution, we have a fork, with at least two sides working on different solutions. Remember, Bitcoin is an open source project. 
Increasing the blocksize could potentially lead to more centralization in the future, while not increasing the blocksize would lead to more "competition" to get a transaction in a block, which indirectly leads to higher fees for people that want fast transactions

IMO, you should do dollar cost averaging, buying smaller amounts every week or biweekly. If you see a big dip like last week, then maybe you can put in a bit more if you have the dough.
Doing this you wont miss a possible correction, and you wont miss out if there wont be one.
MY OPINION.

Even if i wasnt, BTC does not have the capacity to replace a normal currency at this current moment is all im saying.

It is probably going to be a while before the lightning network is implemented, which could fix these problems. 
How long have you been in Bitcoin? If you held bitcoin 1.aug this year you would still have BCH if you control your private keys.

With full blocks and expensive txs, opening and closing channels will still cost a lot of sats. Would i have to pay to re-open channels if i ever go offline?
My always online system would also be a target here though, and would be somewhat of a risk. 
I believe the adoption would be slowed down here aswell though.
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:53:00
Haha its so nice to talk to people about this without the hostility. Thank you for this. I'll gladly use LN or its successor whenever its ready, but in the meantime I'll use BCH.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:55:24
So if i write a line of code that the rest of the world doesnt use, its automatically a scam? Stop fooling yourself. BCH itself isnt a scam. Its different code with different properties. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:47:08
People need to stop saying that. Im more of a neutral than a BTC/BCH only kinda guy. I have both.
BCH is as much of a scam as BTC. Its just a different protocol, with people cheering for different sides because its the one they use. They can hopefully be used to achieve the same thing, a cheap and trustless transaction system.
Iphone users arent going around calling android users scammers. They prefer different systems depending on their current needs. If you want cheaper transactions right now, BCH is the way to go. If you want to put your money on LN being better once its done, use BTC. 
The problem right now is that many people arent using their coins, just sitting on them, and talking shit online. BCH and BTC are both usable, and have different properties.
 
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:35:59
The bch code doesnt do that. Idiots claming BCH=BTC do that. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:43:38
Tell me why
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:16:43
If you need to constantly send transactions, BCH would make more sense from a business perspective. If you were to start a business TODAY, sending/recieving BCH is great. Adopting LN whenever its ready will still be possible. 
I just think people close their doors too fast, and are often too dismissive. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:39:15
I see your point about centralization being a potential problem, but that doesn't have anything to do about the fundamentals of money. The USD cant store value because its centralized by the Federal Reserve?
Bitcoin with PoW will always be somewhat centralized because of cheaper power/ cooler weather etc. In the long run, i doubt there is anything we can do about it without changing bitcoin to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 10:41:56
That might be true now, but in december we had fees around 50 usd, and if bitcoin goes "mainstream" in terms of usage, not speculation, we'll probably see that again anyway
@_date: 2018-03-20 10:01:58
Im not promoting anything. The result of bigger blocks is less fees. The result of smaller blocks is higher fees, but smaller harddrive space. The normal user of the current BTC network wouldn't download the blockchain at all, while LN requires every single user to download it. 
This is if i've understood things correctly.
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:24:13
I think you need 2-4 players for the doomsday heists.
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:16:46
Store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account.
If its only property is to store value, why wouldn't people just buy real estate or some ETF?. If you can't use it as a medium of exchange, I doubt BTC has a future. Paying 50$ in fees puts a huge roadblock for the medium of exchange part. 
I'm not saying that LN wouldn't fix that, but right now, LN isnt big enough, hence why I'd rather use BCH at the moment.
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:53:04
Wouldn't you need the blockchain downloaded to operate a node? 
I hate this tribalism, i was just asking a question about how this will work. If the only thing you can do for me is to be mad, just dont comment.

I personally don't believe in digital gold. if it isn't used as cash, it would only have value because people would buy it, and if it has no use, people wouldn't buy.
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:28:46
What i meant is that mining will eventually flock to areas with cheap electricity. Mining here will make it easier to expand, making these miners more powerful compared to areas with higher cost, thereby centralizing mining to some extent. I didn't mean that the 51% attack is unavoidable. 
In a perfect world, hashpower is equally distributed around the globe, and not just in China and Iceland. These problems come inherently with PoW though, and would apply to both BTC and BCH.
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:46:30
BCH doesnt rely on having a ton of always online nodes though, unlike LN. LN doesnt function properly without thousands of nodes. BCH only "needs" nodes with hashpower behind them, aka miners. 
You can use your own node to verify your own transactions, but this only helps you, and not the rest of the network.
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:23:11
Bcash is just a protocol, regardless of Roger Ver. Right now its cheaper to use. LN doesn't work at scale right now, and if it is to be successfull, it probably needs to grow for years. 
LN is an interesting development, and I'll be following it closely, but right now, I'll stick to what currently works. Many platforms are finally starting to accept bch aswell, so its much more usefull than what it once was. 
People need to stop being so dissmissive. Its tech, and it works. Digital gold is a fantasy IMO. Bitcoin was made to be P2P cash, and LN could be that, but so could Bcash. These are just different scaling proposals of bitcoin, and not a scam. There are a lot of scams out there, but Bcash is not one of them. Its just a different protocol.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:31:58
4% is not enough without LN or BCH.
Buy something for 20$, 0.8$ in fees. It might work today, but not with the network traffic we saw desember 2017. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:41:38
1$ in fees is relevant if you are buying the classic cup of coffee. 
1Sat/B transactions could be getting through right now, but they wouldn't if we see another december/january period, where fees of 20$ were normal. These 1Sat/B transactions are often very slow aswell.
It still has a usecase i guess, with sending five figures with relatively low fees, however, this isn't really usable digital cash.

The original Bitcoin doesnt exist anymore. Its an open source project, so "ripping off" isnt really a thing. It has several dev teams, and "graphene" compression is set to dampen the effect of bigger blocks. 
BTC is also centralized by chinese miners, and BCH continues to just be a protocol regardless of Roger Vers occupation.
If you look at utility at this very moment, BCH has more going for it, but that could easily change if LN takes of.

Second layer solutions is still possible. In BTC it  currently is a problem because we're not able to set up enough channels quick enough. 
If BTC had a throughput of 220 TPS(like bch) this would not be a problem. Do the the same math problem as above and it equates to a month. We wont get 600.000.000 users in a month.

Bitcoin Core is not willing to go through a hard fork because it risks the network. I feel it is under more risk if merchants and consumers rely on the network already. What happens if there is contention, and half of LN nodes use one coin, while one half uses the other.
I feel its like building an uneven house, and then trying fixing the foundation later.

Other currencies with lower fees would make the problem easier to deal with

How will you solve the problems in my post without a blocksize increase?
@_date: 2018-07-26 02:47:10
How is more transparency a bad thing?

Oh gee i wonder

Dont you think that moderators with biases can create an echochamber? I just want people with more open minds in this scene, and not idiots yelling BTRASH everytime BCH is mentioned. 
LN has problems(routing, funded channels, always online node requirement), and if worst comes to worst, having other alternatives open is a great thing. 
Im not saying LN will fail, but im more cautious than most in this sub i think. Thats at least what it sounds like.

2.4 is actually far from realistic. I wanted to make it a best case scenario, as It still sounds too slow in my eyes. it would slow down bitcoin for much more than 2,4 years, as people would still use the blockchain for their usual transactions. This also leads to a "Hub and spoke system" where users would make their only channel connect to an entity with sufficient liquidity, and has good connections for proper routing. 
I heard somewhere that 14 channels were recommended to keep the system decentralized. Just do our math problem times 14 and you can see there might be a bigger issue. (this is of course not a requirement)
also, with the internet, and how quick we are able to adapt, we could easily reach 600, as long as it makes sense economically. Somthing it doesnt do in this scenario.

Can B do this at anytime? Sounds kinda clunky, but i guess this would work. Routing does become an even harder problem to solve here though.
