The difficulty is set by the protocol every 2016 blocks to adjust the solution rate to 10 minutes on average. So if by some miracle miners managed to guess a hash below the target within seconds for the next 2016 blocks the difficulty would jump to accommodate the apparent increase of hash power and the target hash would be even lower. The probabilities get so insanely low very quickly if you follow this line of events such that it becomes all but a mathematical impossibility.

Yes. Though again for the entire network to solve blocks slower as a result of shear bad luck is unlikely, with the numbers we're dealing with probability does hold true on average (and we're dealing with averages over 2016 blocks) which means anomalies all but dissappear. What is more likely is that as block rewards drop there may be a reduction in the hashing power needed to remain profitable, which would make people pull out and mine other stuff, lowering the difficulty, thus making it more profitable, thus making it more attractive. The point of this design is to find that equilibrium. It's the reason it's resistant to centralisation, because changes in hash power are met by a change in the hashing power needed.
Coins (proof of work coins anyway) use these values, the solve time and the frequency that difficulty is recalculated, to give it the network certain characteristics. Dogecoin, for example, computes difficulty every block, which means that it's resistant to big pools, especially multipools, because as soon as one block is mined in under a minute (the solve target time) the difficulty goes up accordingly and it's almost certainly more profitable to use that same hashing power on a different blockchain so a multipools will switch to a different network and the difficulty will drop again. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:07:52
I think not because of the economic aspect. Mining costs something, in electricity and equipment, so it should reach the point that adding hashing power to the network isn't worth what it costs you to buy a warehouse and fill it with ASICs due to the fact that you just cause the difficulty to rise and become an ever deninishing proportion of the available hashing power. Basically the equilibrium where the marginal gains meet marginal costs. That point moves based on all the cost factors and the value of the block reward (price and size of reward).

Yeah, but then why do people get so defensive when you identify investment as gambling? I remember saying it to someone on IRC a few years ago and he got extremely defensive and shouty. It all started as he was talking about daytrading on the stock market and me saying that I could never do that because I know I'd be a terrible gambler and end up loosing loads of money. Cue over-defensive triad over why investing isn't gambling. Constantly going on about "but you can asses past performance and read the charts", but then I can look at the past performances of horses before placing a bet on one, doesn't make it not gambling.

In my mind all investing is by its nature gambling. I really don't know why people are so turned off by that assessment though. As if there is something wrong with attempting to gain by taking a risk. Smart gambling involves taking calculated risks like being prepared to lose your stake, i.e. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:31:51
Right, but you have less control over the outcome of an investment than you do the actions of the other players in the poker game. You maybe have greater predictability, but you can't bluff a market into acting a certain way, at least not alone. So you are making informed gambles. What you control is how much you invest/bet on the desired outcome. To me it's no different. Some gambling is just longer term.

@_date: 2018-01-15 10:38:26
That's irrelevant because the difficulty is tied to the time it has taken to mine the last 2016 blocks.

You are missing the secondary effect. If wages do increase in line with inflation then your income increases but they rarely also readjust the thresholds of the progressive income tax, meaning you are earning the same in real terms but being taxed a greater proportion of those earnings.

@_date: 2014-12-03 19:55:26
I have thought for a while a PGP-like certification WoT where more than one trusted signature is required and more Sigs of less trusted certs and so on and so forth. A sensible interface in browsers for altering trust manually if you want but default could even be the standard CA bundle trustfile. That way websites could cross certify each other, multiple CAs could certify for a stronger trust, users could modify their default trust model to be more paranoid if they wanted, etc.
I am convinced this would be imperfect but it would remove the centralised single-point of trust model we have today.

I think in practice it doesn't happen for low value barter like that, as is the same with cash. If I bought biscuits from a neighbor for cash or orange juice I would not be paying tax, even if the letter of the law says I should. Secondly cash would be better for this anyway seeing as you have already paid VAT on the orange juice, as well as income tax on the money (probably).

Nothing at the protocol level of BTC makes it restricted to Earth. Surely we have good enough connectivity with the ISS to trade BTC to there. Or to satalites in more distant orbits. we send and recieve data with stuff in space all the time. It just needs applying, and probably optimising.

First off, that was kinda tongue-on-cheek. Secondly, Aren't we at least supposed to be sending a few people to Mars in a few decades? Even ignoring that the post stated that **Bitcoin** is not limited to Earth, not infrastructure. If the infrastructure existed or exists one day there is nothing stopping Bitcoin protocols working on other planets or on spacecraft mid-flight. It is limited at an infrastructure level, not a protocol level. There's nothing even to say that transactions must be transmitted over IP.

The market doesn't give a shit if they grumble, though, it gives a shit whether or not they pay. If they pay, paying was worth it to them. Nothing else matters. If there was no surge pricing they would pay in waiting time anyway, so they might not think it is worth paying the standard price if the wait will be twice as long, and they would undoubtedly grumble. The price at any moment is the point of intersection at which the drivers are willing to work and the customers are willing to pay for a given amount of waiting.

the probability that some data matches a 4-byte checksum is 1 in 2^32 (4,294,967,296). That's all that matters due to the nature of a cryptographic hash function, since any change in the data has the same probability of having a collision with the hash. Likewise if the change is that one char is changed in the data part and one in the checksum then the probability of the new data matching the new checksum is the same.

Not an "expert" by any means, but of course there is room for consensus, what matters to the miners more than *which* consensus is reached is that *a* consensus is reached. The value of the coins that they get as a block reward stems from being on the longer blockchain (mainchain). Of course, if there are major technical limitations of a particular BIP that would reduce the utility of the resultant coin (main or alt) then it makes sense not to go for that one. If nothing changes then the 1M blocksize will become a significant limitation so staying on that limit long-term is a bad idea, the "voting" you see is ultimately a way of miners signaling their preference to aid in the reaching of this consensus. It removes a lot of guesswork around your expectations of what the other "players" will do, which makes reaching a consensus easier and faster, which is desirable.
Ultimately if Core does not change in any way, but forks which hardfork the protocol exist then at some point the limitations of Core will make it the less valuable chain and miners would move away from it in favour of the "altcoins" created by forks. And again, the fork worth picking is the fork that everyone else is using, which is just a consensus from eveyone in the economy, just not the Core devs.

It's interesting to compare with what people say about Vitalik being a reason Etherium is good in contrast to your sentiment here. Strong thought leadership is a good thing, I think, but not if it becomes just a means of any decision of the community at large basically falling back on an appeal to authority.

Maybe the fact that he ran a website that facilitated nonviolent free trade, forcing nobody to do anything they didn't want to. A place where people sold drugs, for instance, beating competition by having a good reputation with their customers instead of using aggressive means to prevent competitors doing business.
He broke the law but he is not guilty of any crime. Maybe if the Jury understood their right to nullification, to evaluate the law itself and the application of the law to this case, then they might have reached a not guilty verdict on the grounds that the law is wrong.

In some way it does, actually spending bitcoin will stabilise the currency and being willing to make trivial purchases shows a mindset of wanting to use it as a currency, not an investment. If people keep just investing and never spending, the rarity and difficulty to produce/obtain will push the value up but it will be unstable because it is backed only by its investment. 
A willingness to make micro transactions; and, by extension, a willingness to accept them; for snacks and drink is what the community and the currency needs to thrive and become strong and stable.
