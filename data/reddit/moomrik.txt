Yeah, I do fall in that last category, you got me on that ;)
I definitely went into it as early as I did because of my SO (exactly one year ago), but I'm pretty sure I would have heard of it by now and invested in a couple of coins. Buuut you never know. That's what I like to think.
Why the split? Good question ... I can only speak for myself and not for other women (as I am no other woman but me), but I think I need things/consepts a bit shiny and sexy before they are interesting. Like bright colors and and a smooth UI. That's how they will get my attention, anyway - unless someone like the important male figure in my life keeps feeding me with "this is bigger than the internet" and "everyone uses money" and blowing my mind *all the time*. 
And I can see that out of the people he talks to the guys are always the ones making further inquiries. They get hooked on the idea at once, and ask questions - good questions - until they feel they have a satisfying picture. Many of them end up investing after doing some research on their own.
The girls ... just don't. I have one female friend to whom I introduced bitcoin who penetrated the matter pretty quickly, but that's it. It's not that they don't understand, but they take one look and deems it something of no use to them and definitely not shiny enough. If you only showed us a smacking app ... or all the healthy food you can buy with bitcoins ...
What do you think?

This is great advice and easy to forget. Thanks!

Is [this]( like so you right now?

*WOW*. That is more than mildly interesting.

*I see what you did there ...*

23, been a bitcoiner for exactly a year, made enough on value increase to drop out of uni and start on my own. Moving to Chile to become a property investor. Used to study genetics. Now considering programming. 
Also female. Like art, gardening, music and bacon.

Right here!
Went to the BTC conference in Amsterdam in September and it was definitely a sausage fest. Out of the whole crowd I could count the female participants on two hands. I like the competition this implies, though. Plus no queue in the ladies room!
