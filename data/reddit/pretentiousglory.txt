Depends on what you consider bearish.

Well, the internet in general would be fucked if SHA256 was broken.

I wouldn't say it's meaningless. Meaningless for figuring out the 'actual' tangible value of something, sure. But if you look at that and say "well, that means nothing, so I'm going to ignore it" then you're missing out on information.

How much did you make, though? I always read/hear these stories and it's always like "oh, well, I had two coins" which is *impressive* and all, but. Maybe not as lifechanging as people like to say.

I mean, that's still pretty sick. Few people would've predicted where it's at now.

I definitely know people who cashed out, but that was way earlier. Like they invested a ton when it was $100, cashed out at $1000. A friend of a friend bought a fucking *castle*, but you're right, it had to go -&gt; USD first. I'm betting he regrets not holding to $10000 though, lol. And of course that fear of missing out is what keeps people holding.

Lol. All of the major players would have to arrange, coordinate, and deliberately execute a flawless strategy. Or maybe a nuclear war. In any case, that would be surprising...

Yeah, I know a few people (well, okay, one person) who's big on currency speculation. And honestly, isn't that sort of the same thing as bitcoin speculation? I'm pretty sure there'll be (if there isn't already) some sort of [Tobin tax]( introduced when btc goes more mainstream than it already is.
