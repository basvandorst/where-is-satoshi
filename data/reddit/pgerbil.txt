They offer two different "vaults", one of which is a MultiSig vault.  The vaults impose delays and require extra validation steps before you can withdraw bitcoin.  This provide some extra security against having your login information and 2FA stolen/hacked.  The multisig vault allows you to control two of the three private keys for the wallet.   Since only two of the three private keys are required to withdraw funds, the multisig vault should allow you to access your funds in the event that Coinbase disappears.
My recommendation would be to use a strong password and Google Authenticator with your regular Coinbase wallet, and to buy a hardware wallet when you have more bitcoin to store.

They are planing to increase their control by creating a closed/centralized network in which an elite group of people will decide when and how much currency to create depending on political considerations.  They are trying to create a fiat currency with improved record-keeping.  Unlike the bitcoin blockchain, I expect their blockchain to include identifying information (or to be linked to a database of identifying information).

I agree that many genuinely believe that the public benefits from having a depreciating currency.  It forces people to gamble on risky investments like stocks to have any hope of protecting the value of their savings.  They feel this benefits the economy as well as government (which causes currency debasement by borrowing/printing and spending), and they ignore how this contributes to wealth disparity.  These false theories are taught by colleges and universities which depend on big government money.

ETF's are bought and sold on stock exchanges like a stock.  A bitcoin ETF would enable large institutional investors (e.g., pension funds) to pour big money into bitcoin.  It would also enable small individual investors who may lack the skill and/or confidence to purchase and store bitcoins themselves to easily invest.  
Most people think that approval of the COIN ETF is unlikely for a variety of reasons.

The video report associated with this article is actually positive on bitcoin.  However, I think the one fellow's claim that bitcoin is becoming correlated with stocks is foolish.  There's not nearly enough evidence for such a claim.
In my opinion, if bitcoin ETF's are approved (attracting institutional investors), bitcoin will eventually become more correlated with gold.

When I had an issue with a $500 ACH transfer, I sent a message to their customer support.   They did not respond, but instead locked my account a couple days later (which contained much more than $500 worth of bitcoin).  I sent additional emails to which they responded that my account would be unlocked after my previous transfers cleared so I could transfer the $500 I owed.   Then a week or so later, my account was "unlocked" but my transfer limit was still zero.   Support said they would not let me do any ACH transfers until I wired $500 to them (which costs $30 in fees).  I decided to sell some of the BTC in my account to cover the $500 I owed and asked them to reset my transfer limit (I also offered to send them a check and to provide proof of my bank balances).  Support refused but said that if I wired money to them, they'd reimburse my $30 fee and would reset my ACH transfer limit.  I agreed, but since I made the wire transfer, they have not reimbursed the $30, they have not reset my ACH transfer limit (which is zero), and they have not responded to my emails.

Their policy of requiring that I wire $500 to them (rather than proving I had far more than that in my bank account) after I already paid them the $500 from a failed transfer (by selling some BTC) seems nonsensical.  Their failure to follow through with their promises is foolish, since I can cost them much more than $30 in lost business.

Millibitcoin or mBTC are crappy names.  I think mBits is somewhat better because it has fewer syllables to pronounce and may help folks understand that it equals 1000 bits.   The idea of an mBit being worth 1000 bits is more psychologically appealing than an mBTC being worth 0.001 of a bitcoin.

If you want the freedom to send/spend your money however you wish, then blockchain.info would be a better choice.  Gemini would enable you to purchase more bitcoin, however.  You could create both wallets, buy bitcoin at Gemini, and then send the bitcoin to your blockchain.info wallet before using it to gamble, donate to WikiLeaks, etc.  If you decide to save a significant amount of bitcoin, consider a hardware wallet.

I would guess that Chinese miners are subject to the same capital flight regulations (limiting how much money/bitcoin they can send out of the country) as other citizens.  Therefore, if PBOC actions continue to suppress the bitcoin price on Chinese exchanges, mining may become somewhat less profitable.  However, I suspect miners can sell bitcoins through brokers (bypassing the exchanges) at higher prices than on the exchanges.

Perhaps you should read a book.  Your dollar-cost-averaging advice is not supported by research or mathematics.

If your coins are in a private wallet, it might take 30-40 minutes to transfer them to an exchange for trading (assuming you pay an appropriate transaction fee).  This extra time might enable you to make a better trading decision than if you reacted "instantly" to some event.

This appears to be a very innovative peer-to-peer wagering site.  I like how easy it is to place bets with bitcoin;  you don't even have to register.  You can send bitcoin anonymously and if you win, they'll send your winnings back to the same BTC address (or another BTC address of your choice).  
This appears to be a good option for betting small amounts on the ETF decision.  Due to the "Parimutuel" nature of the bet, however, I cannot bet nearly as much as I would like without dramatically changing the odds (against me).   Therefore, I'd encourage anyone who wants to bet that the Winkletwins's ETF will be approved to check it out.  I'll improve your odds by increasing my "No" wager!

It is important to understand that the "average" can be a misleading statistic; it may not reflect the typical case.  For example, the average of 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, and 52 = 8  The "median" statistic tends to be a more accurate indication of a typical case.  In my example, the median value is 2.  In the case of bitcoin transaction size, the median is very likely to be considerably less than the average.

The author of this article, Mr. Smart, does not understand the Emerita Capital analysis he is discussing.  The Emerita Capital article hypothesized that the bitcoin price would spike more than 300% if the ETF is approved.  The 67.8% figure reflects their belief that the fair or true value of bitcoin is about 67.8% higher than its price at the time of their analysis.  Once the ETF decision is known, the fair or true value of bitcoin will change dramatically (according to their analysis).

I agree with you that Coinbase is the easiest and safest option for non-tech-savvy folks to buy and store bitcoins (at least in America).  I've purchased most of my BTC from GDAX (the Coinbase exchange) and use Coinbase as my "hot wallet."  I keep most of my bitcoin in a hardware wallet. 
I have also purchased bitcoin from Gemini and have found their website and their customer service to be far inferior to Coinbase/GDAX.  I do not entirely trust Gemini to hold my bitcoins.
In either case, customers should avoid transferring funds directly between Coinbase or Gemini and gambling sites, drug dealers, and other disapproved entities or else risk having your account closed.  I think some of the vocal Coinbase critics may have failed to heed this advice.  Others are philosophically opposed to trusting any third party to hold your bitcoins.   For most folks, however, I believe the risks of having a software wallet (installed on your personal computer or smartphone) compromised by hackers is much greater than the risk of losing bitcoins held by Coinbase (assuming you use a strong password and Google Authenticator).

No.  Electrum is a software wallet that you install on your personal computer.  Hardware wallets are much more secure against cyber-thieves (i.e., hackers).

Coinbase is a pioneer in making BTC more accessible and useful; I value their contributions to the bitcoin economy.

No need to worry.  Coinbase sometimes takes a while to process transactions.  Though most of my Coinbase transactions have been nearly instant, on one occasion they took about two hours to broadcast a transaction.  
An advantage of using Coinbase for a "hot wallet" is that they pay your transaction fees.  If you need to make transactions that are guaranteed to be broadcast quickly, however, then you may wish to keep some bitcoin in a private wallet for that purpose.

Thank you for responding.  When I clicked on your "How does it work?" link, it took me to a six word explanation titled "How I can buy?"  This failed to address my primary concern, which is how you can offer a 10% discount and make a profit (especially when customers do not pay with bitcoin).  Am I correct in understanding that when customers pay with a fiat, gift-thrift must give a percentage to PayPal or the credit card company?
I was also concerned about whether you had Amazon's approval (since they could otherwise close your account).   Another concern is how your customer service (e.g., handling returns) will compare with Amazon's great service.
I am encouraged by your responses here and may try your service.  If you are legit, I would prefer your service to PurseIO because I want to hodl my bitcoins, and because you guarantee Prime 2-day shipping (unlike PurseIO when you "name your discount").

Will China-Coin be good or bad for bitcoin?
A good scenario would be that China tolerates bitcoin while teaching their population how to use their fiat cryptocurrency.  This could accelerate the use of bitcoin as a store of value among the newly educated Chinese population (even if the government imposes limits on their annual bitcoin purchases).
A negative scenario would be that China tries to outlaw bitcoin.  Perhaps they close the exchanges and seize the bitcoin mining pools to use for their China-Coin. 
What do you think?
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:56:23
Since you only have a small amount of bitcoin, it is probably not worth buying a hardware wallet.  One option would be to transfer the bitcoin to a web-based wallet; blockchain.info is very popular and does not require ID verification like Coinbase and other exchanges.  Another option would be a software wallet like Electrum that you install on your own computer; software wallets may be more vulnerable to hackers if your computer is infected, however. 
Coinbase and Gemini must comply with U.S. banking regulations.  If you transfer funds directly between these exchanges and gambling sites, black market drug sites, or other disapproved entities, they may close your account.  Might this have happened in your case? 
@_date: 2017-02-14 08:48:34
The simplest and safest way to buy bitcoin in the US is Coinbase.  If you also want the cheapest way, that would be the Coinbase exchange which is called GDAX.   After getting an account verified at Coinbase, it is easy to also open a GDAX account.  To use GDAX most cheaply, you can do free ACH transfers from a linked bank account which can take about a week to clear.  If you do not want to wait that long, you can pay for a wire transfer or buy from Coinbase instantly (and pay higher fees).  
I've also used Gemini to buy, but find them to be far less user-friendly.  Unlike GDAX, their exchange does not enable you to avoid trading fees by placing limit orders instead of market orders.
Coinbase will provide an online bitcoin wallet that you can use to make online purchases; they are partners with PurseIO  which enables you to buy stuff from Amazon with bitcoin.
For long term storage of relatively large amounts of bitcoin, it would be a good idea buy a hardware wallet.

I think the concentration of mining in China may be bad.  If those miners can't sell their BTC outside of China, then the BTC price outside of China would be expected to increase (due to diminished supply).  This could potentially reduce China's mining domination by making mining in other countries more profitable.
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:52:32
If you did this with a well established and understood commodity like gold, it would be pretty stupid.  It is a little less stupid with bitcoin, IMO, because there is a more of a chance that short-term price movements could signal important changes in fundamentals (e.g., influx of institutional money, approval of an ETF, new positive or negative regulations, etc).

I think Coinbase may be the safest custodial web wallet that exists.  However, you still need to be wary of malware or phishing sites stealing your login information.

Hardware wallets are the safest option.  I use the Ledger Nano Duo Edition which costs about $50.

I commented on this topic in an earlier thread and was surprised by the lack of interest.  It seems to me that most folks are underestimating the significance and risks of this news.  Bloomberg has reported that the PBOC is planning to introduce a national cryptocurrency "soon."  They state it will be used for retail transactions, implying that it will replace their current fiat currency.  I would like to share some of my predictions, questions, and concerns.  
PREDICTIONS:  
	• This will be an inflationary fiat currency controlled by a small cabal of elites; their blockchain will be centralized and private.  An unlimited number of new "coins" will be issued by fiat rather than an algorithm or proof of work.
	• The article says the PBOC blockchain will enable them to collect accurate real-time data on money flows, allowing them to try to micromanage the economy on an hourly basis rather than waiting for monthly reports.  This will cause the PBOC to make far more frequent bad decisions, possibly precipitating an economic meltdown.
	• Their blockchain will include personal identifying information.
	• The government will use the blockchain to suppress and punish political opposition.
	• The government will use the blockchain to automatically collect taxes.
	• Citizens will hold this new currency in custodial bank accounts which will look like current bank accounts.  The cryptographic nature of the currency will be hidden, thereby limiting potential positive transference to bitcoin.
	• If they have the technical ability to pull this off, their crypto-fiat currency will be the only currency used as a medium of exchange within China.   It will help lower  retail costs and consumer prices.
	• If China's crypto-fiat currency is successful, other nations will follow their example.
     1.  Is the technology to handle all the monetary transactions within China on a blockchain known to exist?
     2.  What type of computer processing power would be required to run and secure this blockchain?  [I'm wondering whether they'd be motivated to seize the large bitcoin mining operations to use for their crypto-fiat currency.]
     3.  How would the security risks of running their entire economy on a single centralized blockchain compare to the security of their current system?
The Bloomberg article mentions that this is part of a movement away from physical cash, as has been seen in India and elsewhere.  IMO, this national crypto-fiat currency could be a huge step toward global tyranny.  Big-government totalitarian types dream of completely eliminating financial privacy and freedom; they would like no transfer of money to be able to escape the prying eye of spy agencies and tax authorities.   Decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin stand in the way of this dream.
National crypto-fiat currencies would likely eliminate the potential cost-saving advantage that bitcoin might have had for micropayments and retail transactions (within national borders).  Since the current major fiat currencies already have a virtual monopoly on retail transactions, this would not be a significant loss for bitcoin.  In fact, it might be a benefit if it reduces the risk of a contentious hardfork caused by folks who want their coffee purchases immortalized on the bitcoin blockchain.  It would also eliminate government concerns about bitcoin being used to avoid sales taxes.  Crypto-fiat currencies would still be unable to compete with bitcoin as a store of value.  Unless…
The reason most of us have scoffed at the risk of China or other countries "banning" bitcoin is we have believed it is impractical.  In fact, I have thought they wouldn't dare try it, since they know it would just drive bitcoin underground and perhaps even cause a stealthier and more robust cryptocurrency to arise.  I am not so complacent now.
Suppose China's new crypto-fiat currency enables them to know who owns every bit of their currency at every point in time.  Now what would happen if they ban the purchase of bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies?  How many goats would it take to trade for a bitcoin in China?  
I do not really think that China is planning to ban bitcoin at this time (at least not as an investment).  In fact, their primary motivation may be to improve their citizen's standard of living by increasing the efficiency of financial transactions and tax collection.  In this case, China may continue to tolerate its citizens investing in bitcoin as a store of value…though probably with some annual purchase limit (that they could easily enforce).   However, when the next economic crisis is looming and they are desperate for money, I'm not sure what would stop them (and other nations with crypto-fiat currencies) from effectively banning bitcoin.

It is not clear to me that Vinny Lingham is advocating SegWit for the purpose of scaling.  Vinny appears to think that enacting SegWit would reduce or eliminate the risk of a disastrous hard fork.  If true, I believe this would add far more value to bitcoin than increased tps.  I have also read that SegWit would enable hardware wallets to function more efficiently, which I regard as a significant plus.
I agree there is little reason to believe that cheaper and faster transactions would increase the value of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:26:57
Bitcoin's value certainly grows with its adoption and use as a store of value.  In my case, about 99.9% of my bitcoin purchases have been to hodl as a store of value, and I have used about 0.1% of my bitcoin purchases to buy stuff or give away.   Bitcoin has trouble competing with fiat for retail transactions, except for illegal activity (which may have negative consequences for bitcoin) or possibly in nations experiencing hyperinflation.

Governments are moving toward a completely cashless society in which no money transfer can escape the prying eyes of spy agencies and tax collectors.  China is trying to use a centralized blockchain to create a national fiat cryptocurrency to move toward this goal.  When authorities are able to track the ownership of their fiat currency, they will have the power to effectively ban using their currency to buy bitcoin (and altcoins).  An ETF in the US may help prevent this outcome. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 08:19:04

If the stars align (e.g., an ETF is approved, SegWit is implemented, etc.), one bitcoin could be worth tens of thousands of dollars in the not too distant future.  On the other hand, if disaster strikes (e.g., a contentious hard fork), you could lose nearly all of your $1000.  In my opinion, bitcoin is a good bet due to its asymmetric risk/reward ratio.

I primarily use bitcoin as an investment.  I buy bitcoin at GDAX, transfer them to my Coinbase wallet (an instant internal off-chain transaction), and periodically send a few bitcoins to my hardware wallet.  Coinbase pays the network transaction fees and I'm happy when the transaction is confirmed within 24 hours.
I also make occasional online bitcoin purchases from my Coinbase wallet.   I've made free off-chain bitcoin transfers to PurseIO (a Coinbase partner) to buy stuff from Amazon.  I've also made a few other purchases and Coinbase payed the network transaction fees.
I've also sent bitcoin from my private wallets, but not in small amounts.  I have never been bothered by the fees or confirmation times except for one occasion. My private wallet had a bug which caused it to calculate a much too small fee (about 1 satoshi per byte), resulting in a transaction that got stuck in limbo a couple of days.  [It had been a while since I had to pay my own transaction fee, and I missed the error.]  I did not blame the bitcoin network, however.

I believe the easiest and safest way to buy some bitcoin (at least in America) is Coinbase.  You must verify your identity to set up an account like at a traditional bank.  Then you can transfer money from your traditional bank to Coinbase for free and buy bitcoin (for a fee).  To minimize fees, you can trade USD for bitcoin at GDAX, which is the Coinbase exchange.  Using a bitcoin exchange is similar to buying a stock on an online brokerage site.

Good article, though I'm not sure his conclusions about leverage are entirely correct.  He wrote:  "There are no futures contracts that enable large exposures with minimal collateral.

The appropriate comparison would be Gemini versus GDAX.  GDAX is an exchange that is run by Coinbase.  I have found the GDAX/Coinbase support to be far more competent and professional than Gemini.  I also find their website to be far superior.  In addition, you can avoid trading fees at GDAX by using limit orders that are not immediately filled.  This is not possible at Gemini, which has a more complicated fee structure that favors high volume users.  I don't think Gemini cares about small bitcoin investors/traders.
Coinbase provides an easy way to buy and sell bitcoin (or etherium) at specified exchange rates without needing to understand bid and ask prices or limit and market orders; however, you will pay more for this service.  
I believe Coinbase (and GDAX) is a relatively safe place to store bitcoins (especially for those who may lack the ability to safeguard their own bitcoin).  Their bitcoin (and etherium) holdings are privately insured, and your USD at Coinbase has FDIC insurance.  I don't think Gemini insures your bitcoin holdings.
Coinbase also provides more levels of security options for their bitcoin wallets than Gemini.  Their "vault" provides extra safeguards against your login information being stolen.  They also offer a multi-signature vault which allows you to have control of two out of three of the wallet's private keys.  This means Coinbase would be unable to seize your bitcoin or prevent you from accessing your bitcoin even if ordered to do so by the government.
I've purchase nearly all my bitcoin at GDAX and I keep a moderately small amount in my Coinbase wallet to use for online transactions.  Coinbase is partners with PurseIO, which enables you to get discounts on Amazon products with bitcoin.
Be aware that if you transfer bitcoin between illegal/disapproved entities (e.g., gambling sites) and your Coinbase/GDAX or Gemini wallets, you risk having your account closed (due to banking regulations).  You will need a private wallet for such activities.  [Some vocal Coinbase detractors had their accounts closed for this reason.  Others are philosophically opposed to allowing any third party to hold your bitcoin.]

I greatly appreciate Jihan's sharing of this statement (as well as those who provided translation).  It is so refreshing to finally read an honest and rational argument against SegWit instead of the nonsensical and deceitful rantings of paid shills.  It is hard to achieve compromise without honesty.
I believe Jihan's concern about SegWit reducing the revenue of miners has merit.  The idea that SegWit would cause a great increase in transaction volume requires a big leap of faith.  Although current network tx fees make bitcoin impractical for transferring small amounts of value, we have also not seen much adoption of bitcoin for larger retail transactions.  It is reasonable to doubt that SegWit would greatly increase Bitcoin's ability to compete with fiat for retail transactions.   
I believe bitcoin would be better off focusing on taking market share away from gold (and stocks, bonds, etc.) instead of from Visa and Paypal.  However, I do think that SegWit can provide benefits (other than lower tx fees) that will promote bitcoin adoption, such as more efficient hardware wallets and more user-friendly bitcoin addresses.   Therefore, I really hope a compromise can be reached with miners...primarily to eliminate the threat of a BU hardfork.
Could a compromise with miners take the form of limiting the use of lightning network transactions to relatively small amounts of bitcoin (e.g., less than 0.5 BTC) and requiring larger value transfers to be on-chain?

Sorry for your loss.
Given that your brother was battling cancer, it is surprising that he did not leave instructions for accessing his bitcoin.    Regarding your first question, most of the folks on this forum believe bitcoin is a good investment (like your brother did).   However, it is generally considered an aggressive, high-risk investment.   If you are not familiar with bitcoin and/or have a low risk tolerance for investing, it makes sense to sell some or all of it.  
Assuming you have the legal authority to take control of your brother's bitcoins (I'm not a lawyer), I would recommend opening a Coinbase account and sending the bitcoins to your Coinbase wallet.  From there, it would be easy to sell the bitcoins for USD (if you wish) and send the USD to a linked bank account.   The hard part may be gaining access to your brother's bitcoin wallets.   As far as discovering whether he has bitcoin elsewhere, you can try asking major bitcoin exchanges but I don't know how cooperative they will be.  You may need a lawyer.   
If you find your brother's paper wallets, you may also find records of his other bitcoin accounts.  You should also be familiar with the appearance of Trezor and Ledger Nano hardware wallets in case you find one.

I agree with your warning about using technical analysis to try to predict price movements.  Although it may have limited validity due to the fact that a lot of traders are staring at similar lines drawn on charts to make decisions, these very weak predictive factors are easily overwhelmed by fundamental developments, breaking news, action in other financial markets, and market manipulation by big money traders.
I agree with the importance of institutional investment.  I believe it would help protect bitcoin against government attack.
I do not agree that bitcoin is not theoretically susceptible to bubbles.  However, I would say that bitcoin is no where close to being in an investment bubble at this time.  This does not mean bitcoin is without risk, since there are non-bubble reasons that bitcoin could crash (e.g., technical problems, hardfork, government repression).    
I agree that "assets like bitcoin are only as valuable as the number of people that use it."  However, I'd like to clarify that the use case that most contributes to bitcoin's value is holding it as a store of value.
My advice to bitcoin investors would be to diversify their portfolio with other types of assets, such as stock funds, savings bonds, gold, and real estate.

I hope that was cathartic for you. ;)  I upvoted your post because I agree with most of it and appreciate your contribution.  I particularly agree with your statements:  "It appears that factual reasoning from technical people have only a minor effect on this discussion." and "using technical arguments is often not enough."
Not all members of a religious crusade have the same level of faith.   In this case, however, many of the crusaders with weak faith are likely to be impervious to technical arguments made by people outside of their trusted group largely because they do not fully understand the technical arguments.   These people may respond to logical non-technical arguments that they are capable of understanding.  
With respect to Roger Ver, I doubt it is helpful to ascribe bad intentions to him.   He may be a true believer that cryptocurrencies will replace fiat currencies, end war, end poverty, etc.  In my experience, such idealists also tend to believe that the ends justify the means.  This enables them to commit evil acts with good intentions.  There are also psychological disorders (related to brain functioning) associated with a rigidity of thought, impairing the ability of sufferers to objectively consider evidence that conflicts with their beliefs. 
In the case of Jihan Wu, you suggest that he is motivated by money and power.  As such, he may be open to rational arguments about the risks posed by big block centralization to his money and power.   These risks may come primarily from economic and political considerations rather than technical issues.

Offering services for which there is little or no demand is usually not a good economic strategy.  For most retail consumers, bitcoin is an unattractive and unneeded alternative to fiat.  In nations where people are losing faith in their local fiat, bitcoin becomes a more attractive medium of exchange; the adoption will likely be led by retailers (not bitcoin cheerleaders) who demand to be paid in bitcoin instead of the rapidly depreciating local fiat.  
In most places, bitcoin is currently more useful and desired as a long term store of value (competing with gold) and/or a speculative investment.  Bitcoin can also compete well with services (e.g.,Western Union) that charge high fees to transfer money (especially across borders).

I can imagine some small retail investors jumping ship to invest in a hyped altcoin, but not so much large/institutional investors who have millions or billions of dollars invested in bitcoin.  A primary determinant of an investment's utility as a "store of value" is the number of people who already view it as such.
I do not own any alts.  I am diversified into physical gold, as well as other non-crypto investments.  I do not understand why an alt-coin that is designed to facilitate retail transactions would be expected to increase in value over time.  The currencies that currently serve this function are certainly not increasing in value!

It implies that bitcoin's value is proportional to the number of bitcoin transactions, failing to recognize that bitcoin's value is related to the number of people who view and use it as a store of value (even if they just buy and hold).    It proclaims bitcoin to be a "currency" (as though currency and money are synonymous) when many, including the IRS, view it more as a digital commodity.   And their statement "Bitcoin creates value for the old investors and the new by splitting a finite currency supply more ways" is a confusing way to talk about supply and demand.

Shipping small amounts of gold across international borders may cost more than a 35% tax (if you purchase insurance), and would involve more risk and effort than bitcoin.

In most areas of the world, bitcoin is not close to being able to compete with fiat in the retail transactions marketplace.  However, bitcoin is taking market share away from fiat in the "store of value" market because fiat sucks as a store of value.   In places where the local fiat has ceased to function well as a medium of exchange (usually due to hyperinflation), bitcoin can make inroads.  However, I think there is little to gain (and much to lose) by pushing bitcoin for retail transactions in places where it is not wanted (because fiat is serving that need).   I advise patience.
I strongly disagree with your views that the scarcity of bitcoin is not real and that it is a pyramid scheme.   Gold continued to serve as a store of value even after it ceased to be widely used in retail transactions.  Bitcoin can also survive as a store of value until it is needed for retail transactions when the fiat currencies fail.
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:30:11
The reason that the price of bitcoin is rising relative to fiat currencies is primarily because it is a superior store of value, not because it is better for retail transactions.

Bitcoin differs from typical IRA investments in that it produces no income (unlike stocks and bonds for example) and is very volatile, with the potential of huge appreciation but also substantial risk.   If your diversified portfolio includes income-producing investments, it is generally wiser to put these in an IRA to defer taxation.  In the case of bitcoin, you are more likely to realize huge capital gains or losses over a long period of time IMO.   If held in a traditional IRA, this could result in a much higher tax bill (compared to holding the bitcoin outside of an IRA or inside a Roth IRA).   I believe to justify this risk, you would need to be in a high tax bracket now, have a hyper-aggressive asset allocation which does not include income-producing investments, and be quite certain that your tax rate will be low when withdrawing from the IRA.  Perhaps with the exception of some folks who have their AARP cards, it may not be possible to predict your future tax rates with sufficient certainty.  [Also keep in mind that governments usually increase their spending and  tax rates over time.]

1.  Bitcoin held in a traditional IRA will be taxed as ordinary income upon redemption.  This will likely result in a higher tax bill than if you held bitcoin outside of an IRA and paid capital gains tax upon redemption.  If bitcoin depreciates in value, it would be worse.

Retailers are not the only ones who must take on extra work/costs to use bitcoin.  Spenders often have to pay fees to transfer money to a bitcoin exchange and then pay trading fees to purchase the bitcoin (unless they use alternative methods like localbitcoins.com which costs even more).  Then after spending their bitcoins, Americans must calculate the cost basis of the coins that were spent and compare that to the USD value of the goods or services that were purchased in order to report the difference as a profit or loss on their taxes.  This is why I generally prefer to spend my fiat and hodl my bitcoins.

Let me offer an alternative view.   I think Coinbase is the easiest way for Americans to buy bitcoins, and their exchange, GDAX, has the lowest fees.   However, they need to comply with US banking regulations (hence the ID verification) and have closed the accounts of users who transfer funds directly from their Coinbase wallet to gambling websites and other disapproved entities.  If you plan to use your bitcoins to gamble, buy illegal drugs, or contribute money to Wikileaks,  I recommend that you first transfer the bitcoin to a private wallet that you control.  Similarly, if you get lucky at gambling, you should send your bitcoin winnings to your private wallet instead of to Coinbase.  There are some vocal CB detractors on the forum who may have failed to take these precautions and had their accounts closed.
Gemini is another popular exchange, but they also must follow US banking regulations so the same considerations apply.  Gemini has a more awkward user interface and more confusing fees compared to Coinbase.   However, they offer instant access to up to $500 bank transfers (but you can't withdraw funds until the transfer clears).  Coinbase has higher bank transfer limits, but no instant access.
I also checked out bitsquare.io, which I found to be very confusing and impractical for purchasing significant amounts of bitcoin.  You might want to try them for a small purchase without ID verification, but I found them to be user unfriendly.  
Other options which allow you to avoid ID verification, such as localbitcoins and purseIO, will require that you pay more for your bitcoins.

There are two schools of thought.  One school of thought is that due to the network effect, there will eventually be only one winner in the competition among cryptocurrencies that are trying to do essentially the same thing.  LTC is trying to do essentially the same thing as bitcoin, and BTC has a big lead.  
The other school of thought is that LTC can be like silver to BTC's gold...a less valuable (and less secure) token that is cheaper and faster to use as a medium of exchange.  In this case, the value of LTC may rise in parallel with BTC.
I tend to favor the first school of thought.
P.S.  Even if LTC can be silver to BTC's gold, I think it is a mistake to assume that LTC's value will increase in proportion to its use as a medium of exchange.

If central banks started buying bitcoin, it would be like an official endorsement.  This, along with the rise in price, would entice many individuals to exchange fiat for bitcoin, causing the fiat to lose value.   These developments would greatly limit the ability of governments to confiscate their citizen's wealth through currency debasement.

For a small amount, Coinbase is fine.  For larger amounts, consider using GDAX (which is owned by Coinbase) to buy your bitcoin more cheaply.  You should know or learn about bid and ask prices, and limit and market orders to use GDAX.

You forgot to mention that in some countries such as America, paying for your batteries and cigarettes with bitcoin comes with the obligation to calculate and compare the cost basis of the BTC that was spent to the fiat value of the purchased goods so you can report the difference as a profit or loss on your taxes.   If we encourage lots of newbies to start using their BTC for retail transactions, I suspect a large percentage of them may fall short in their record-keeping and tax-reporting responsibilities.  This could attract unfavorable regulatory attention, which as we've recently seen in regard to events in China, can negatively impact the value of bitcoin.

Coinbase is recommended for beginners because it functions more like a bank than a currency exchange.  You may convert your USD to BTC there without needing to understand bid and ask prices, or limit and market orders.   They also may be the most secure custodial online wallet, though large amounts of BTC should really be held in a hardware wallet.
Coinbase also operates the GDAX exchange, where you can trade USD for BTC for free or for a much smaller fee (and generally better exchange rate).  
The only other exchange I feel comfortable recommending is Bitstamp.  Since it is overseas, your European bank account would enable you to deposit fiat more cheaply than using an international bank wire.

I believe some people hide income from the IRS using gold, collectible art, and other things of value; however, not all people who buy gold or art are treated as likely tax cheats.
The petition also claims that one reason bitcoin is money is that it is used as a "unit of account" to measure the value of goods, services, etc.   I don't think this is true.  The goods and services I have purchased with bitcoin have always been priced in US dollars.  It was only after I added the item to my virtual "shopping cart" and chose the bitcoin option during checkout that the price was converted to BTC based on the current exchange rate.  Since retailers generally must pay their expenses with USD, it is impracticable for them to price their products in BTC due to the volatile BTC/USD exchange rate.  In addition, their customers generally have a better understanding of the value of $23 as opposed to 0.0312076 BTC.

Good points.  I am not accustomed to thinking about investments that have the potential for huge appreciation (like bitcoin).

Hello Dave.  I am also concerned about the decision of Coinbase to categorize transfers as sales.  I transferred most of the BTC I purchased at Coinbase to an Electrum wallet.  I also transferred BTC to two paper wallets.  However, I recently purchased a Ledger hardware wallet and transferred the BTC from those wallets to the Ledger wallet.  I disposed of my two paper wallets and deleted my Electrum wallet.  My Ledger wallet does not have the capability of displaying the addresses to which my BTC were assigned.  How would I prove to the IRS that the BTC that I transferred from Coinbase to three currently non-existent wallets were not sold?

I'm using the  website to keep records of my BTC transactions.

As for that "small pile of coins" that you spent or gave away without keeping records, I'd do my best to recreate records from memory knowing the IRS is not likely to discover my errors.  However, if you spent them at online retail sites, those sites may be able to provide records.

I think some folks may have come to expect to pay pennies to have BTC transactions confirmed within twenty minutes.  Now when they pay a quarter for a transaction that takes hours to be confirmed, they may think something is wrong.

Bitcoin transactions are still MUCH faster than USD ACH transfers and much cheaper than wire transfers.

Though the future value of BTC would be affected by it's use as a payment network (negatively in my opinion), it is not dependent on it.  The only thing that investors need to be able to purchase with BTC is fiat.
I don't think the calculation of the tax liability of BTC purchases could be automated unless people only spent BTC that were obtained from a single source.   Regarding new laws, it is important to understand that most government regulations on commerce serve the purpose of protecting large corporations from competition.  Remember the golden rule:  Whoever has the gold makes the rules.
By the way, it is more than enough for bitcoin to continue dominating the growing "digital gold" market; we do not need to compete with other cryptos that are designed to target other markets.

Correlation is not causation, though I do think that changes in bitcoin investor psychology (and demand) can cause spikes in the activity of bitcoin traders.  By hoarding bitcoins, investors help the BTC price to rise by limiting the supply of bitcoins that are available for purchase.  It makes sense that growing awareness of the nature and resilience of bitcoin (and the diminishing value of fiat currencies) would stimulate an increase in both investor demand and speculative trading.  Major fiat currencies have far more transaction activity yet they lose value over time; few people think this loss of value is caused by the growing level of retail transactions.

I believe that the best interests of bitcoin investors like you and me may conflict with the interests and ambitions of bitcoin entrepreneurs and developers.    For us investors, the robust security of the bitcoin network and bitcoin's "network effects" are critical.  It is also important to have an innocuous regulatory environment that enables us to easily exchange fiat for bitcoin, and visa versa.  Of little importance to us long term investors is having very fast and dirt cheap bitcoin network transactions.   I am going to have to wait 8 days to use the USD that I transferred to GDAX this morning; I don't mind waiting several hours for a BTC transfer to my wallet to be confirmed.  
It is also not important to us bitcoin investors that more people start using BTC to purchase goods and services.  The investment market for gold is huge compared to bitcoin, and I've yet to see anyone offer gold to pay for their groceries (except in videos of Zimbabwe after hyperinflation).   There are very good reasons to expect the investor demand for bitcoin to continue to grow and push up the price in the absence of any growth in consumer/retail usage.
I think bitcoin entrepreneurs may underestimate the risks of increasing the capacity and adoption of bitcoin to the point that it substantially disrupts the profits of the "too big to fail" banks.  In addition, I suspect many bitcoin users in America (and perhaps elsewhere) do not realize that every purchase made with BTC is a taxable event requiring them to calculate the cost basis of the BTC that were spent so they can report any profit or loss to the IRS.   Thus, using BTC for common purchases creates an accounting nightmare.  The big banks will pressure their political beneficiaries to crack down on bitcoin, which will be portrayed as the currency of terrorists, criminals, and tax evaders.  Though some bitcoin entrepreneurs might get rich before this happens, it will not be good for us long term investors!

It is large financial institutions (and the governments that are committed to bailing them out) that have an incentive to prevent bitcoin from gaining capabilities that could potentially disrupt their profits.   If they did this by gaining control of 5% of the network, this would be a best case scenario for bitcoin IMO.  It would mean that bitcoin could continue to function as a long term store of value and its price (relative to fiat) could continue to rise along with investor demand (and as fiat currencies are further debased).  The large banks' investment in bitcoin (to control 5% of the network) would help protect bitcoin from unfavorable government regulation.  Financial institutions could profit from bitcoin by selling ETF's and other derivative products.
Unfortunately, I think it would be a lot cheaper for these financial institutions to protect themselves from competition by having their political partners outlaw bitcoin and shutdown bitcoin exchanges and websites.

During this period of high tx volume, I made a few BTC transfers.  I set the transaction fee calculator of my wallet on "Low (slow confirmation)" and typically paid around 16 cents to transfer thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin in a matter of hours.  I've also had to pay two or three times that much for transactions that had more inputs; it did not bother me.  When I transfer USD from my bank to another bank (or Coinbase), I am often very limited in the amount I am allowed to transfer and it typically takes a week; this does bother me.
 
The bitcoin infrastructure seems fine to me.

First, there is not one official exchange rate.  Different BTC exchanges will have different rates depending on the current supply and demand balance of the traders using each exchange.  You can see how the Coinbase rate (based on their GDAX exchange) compares to others here:    Sometimes, the Coinbase rate is little lower than most others.
To avoid the Coinbase buy fees, open a GDAX account and transfer your USD to GDAX.  Then you can trade for bitcoin using limit orders for free, or you can use market orders for a 0.25% fee.  Coinbase will even pay the bitcoin network fees when you transfer your BTC to an external wallet.

Bitcoin is succeeding because it fulfills the need for a convenient store of value (and perhaps to a lesser degree, because it provides a better way to transfer value across borders).

Bitcoin is not designed to do everything well.  At this time, bitcoin is dominating the "digital gold" market.  No altcoin or virtual asset is close to being a threat to bitcoin's dominance.  The rise in bitcoin's value relative to fiat is primarily due to growing demand from people who view BTC as a safe haven from currency devaluation, negative interest rates, capital controls, political unrest....    
Bitcoin's dominance of the digital gold market depends on its robust security, its network effect, and an innocuous regulatory environment.  It does not depend on very fast, dirt cheap transactions.  Efforts to transform bitcoin so it may better compete in other markets (e.g., retail payments) may backfire and  jeopardize bitcoin's dominance of the potentially huge "digital gold" market.

The network fee is not affected by the value of the transaction; it is affected by the amount of data transmitted.  It can cost more to transfer $1 than $1,000,000 worth of bitcoin.  Fourteen cents is still very cheap to transfer money across borders within minutes or hours, but it is not economical for micro-transactions. 
In the United States, we are required to keep records of our bitcoin transactions in order to calculate the cost basis of our spends for tax purposes.  This also makes micro-transactions impractical for many.

Governments want to confiscate their citizen's savings by systematically devaluing the currency (by "printing" more money to fund their spending projects).  They cannot do this when citizens put their savings in gold and bitcoin.  
It is not practical for governments to take people's gold by force or completely ban gold due to its cultural acceptance.

Though I am not wealthy, I am among the small % who owns both gold and bitcoin.   Of course, there was a time when nearly everyone in America (and other countries) had an ownership stake in gold, and that could be true again if we return to the gold standard.   Your idea that "billionaires" would disproportionately benefit from a return to the gold standard is wrong.  The current fiat money system gives wealthy bankers a monopoly on the ability to "print" money (i.e., lend money they do not have, thereby creating new money).  The currency debasement policies made possible by fiat money (not backed by gold or anything else other than debt) is a form of taxation which burdens the middle class (folks who try to save money in bank accounts) more than other groups.  It is the wealthy class that mostly benefits from the inflated investment asset values (of stocks, bonds, real estate) created by the inflationary policies of the central banks and made possible by fiat currency.

Congrats.  If you are just buying just a small amount of bitcoin and are interested in spending them online (which requires the calculation and reporting of profit or loss to the IRS if you are American), then I'd say the Coinbase web-wallet is fine.  [This assumes you do not intend to use your bitcoin for illegal purposes.] 
If you plan to buy somewhat larger amounts of bitcoin as an investment, I'd recommend transferring your bitcoin to a wallet that you control.  I like Electrum for a desktop/laptop wallet; it is "light weight" in that it does not demand much computer resources to function.
For larger amounts of bitcoin or for maximum security, I would recommend a hardware wallet.   Paper wallets can also be very secure, but are more tricky to do properly.

My honest answer highlights the different needs of bitcoin investors and spenders.  Those of us who use bitcoin as a store of value do not need to make frequent small transactions on the blockchain.  Services such as bitcoin exchanges allow users to accumulate their digital gold in small increments via off-chain transactions for a tiny trading fee or for free.   Then after accumulating a good amount, users can pay the miner fee to have their BTC transferred to a different wallet (or in the case of some services like Coinbase and Circle, do it for free).   Since I am accustomed to waiting about a week (or much longer when shipping/receiving gold) for my monetary value transfers to complete, having to wait just one day or less for a bitcoin transfer seems fast to me.

I believe bitcoin is better money, since it is more likely to retain (and increase) its purchasing power over time.  However, it is little competition for the dollar as a currency (medium of exchange) at this time.  The good news is that it does not need to compete.  Bitcoin has the potential to be a preferred currency when the local fiat ceases to function.  But in most of the world right now, there is a greater need for sound money; bitcoin is well designed to fulfill this need.

I have transferred many thousands of dollars to Coinbase for free, have traded them for bitcoins with no fees using GDAX, and have transferred the bitcoins to external wallets with no fees.

This is why I opened an account with Gemini, which charges unavoidable fees for trading.

The original design (and current design) of bitcoin prioritizes security over transaction speed.  This fact, along with bitcoin's fixed and limited supply, makes it very well suited to serve as digital gold (a store of value) and not well suited for retail transactions.  If bitcoin were to overtake gold as a safe haven investment asset, its price could easily exceed one million of today's dollars for a single bitcoin.   That is a lot to lose if efforts to change bitcoin to make it more competitive as a payment network (or smart contracts protocol, etc) backfire.

What a great graphic presentation of relative valuations.  I do think it shows great growth potential for bitcoin...especially when compared to gold.  According to the figures in that article, the market cap of gold is about 1560 times larger than bitcoin.  The value of gold is primarily due to demand from investors who view it as a store of value.  If bitcoin were to become an equally popular store of value, the value of one bitcoin could exceed a million dollars [multiply the current BTC price by 1560].
In order for this potential to be realized, bitcoin needs to maintain its dominance of the "digital gold" market.  This depends on the "network effect" and the robust decentralized security of the bitcoin network.  It also depends on an innocuous regulatory environment which enables investors to easily trade fiat for bitcoin, and visa versa.  A bitcoin ETF would also help.  
The demand for bitcoin as a long term store of value does not depend on very fast and dirt cheap network transactions, nor does it depend on bitcoin's use as a retail payment network.   I believe that expansion of bitcoin's use in retail transactions would attract unfavorable regulatory attention.  The large financial institutions whose profits would be disrupted would pressure politicians to ban bitcoin and shutdown bitcoin websites.  Bitcoin would be portrayed as the currency of terrorists, pedophiles, and tax evaders.
@_date: 2016-12-10 04:25:16
Although governments cannot control the supply of either one, I would not say that gold and bitcoin are entirely "government independent."  Due to gold's cultural acceptance and decentralized nature (millions of people own a little gold), it would be difficult for governments to stop people from using gold.  However, if bitcoin begins to disrupt tax revenues and/or the profits (solvency) of the too-big-too-fail banks, governments could relatively easily outlaw bitcoin and shutdown bitcoin exchanges, websites, and large mining operations.

There are many relevant variables, starting with your reasons for wanting to buy bitcoin (BTC).  If it is for long term investment, then you need to decide on what percentage of your overall asset allocation plan you wish to be bitcoin.  
Most would regard bitcoin as a relatively aggressive investment (compared to alternatives like savings bonds, CD's, or even stock funds) with high risk and high reward potential.  Even though BTC may be volatile, having a smallish percentage of your assets in BTC could reduce the overall volatility of your portfolio because the BTC price has little correlation with other common investments.  If you are an aggressive investor and/or feel very optimistic about the future value of BTC, then you may want to invest a higher percentage of your net worth in bitcoin.  It is dangerous to put most of your eggs in one basket, however.  
Once you decide on how much bitcoin you wish to buy, I would plan to buy a fixed amount every week or month until you reach your goal.  I actually started by making somewhat larger purchases and began reducing the size of my buys as I got closer to my goal.  I have also accelerated the timing of a buy and/or increased the size of a buy after a price dip.  The danger of trying to wait for a dip in price before buying is that the price can take off and leave you behind.

I chose the Ledger Nano Duo Edition ($47 on Amazon).  With other hardware wallets (e.g., Trezor), someone with access to the device who knows or guesses your 4-digit PIN can steal your bitcoins.  With the Ledger Nano, they would also need your "security card" (or your smartphone on which you downloaded and initialized the Ledger 2FA app using the security card).  The "Duo Edition" provides two Ledger Nano wallets matched to the same security card.  I think the Ledger Nano is a bit less convenient for spending bitcoins, but a bit more secure for long term storage.  I still store a small amount of bitcoin in a web wallet (Coinbase) for spending.  I do not trust mobile wallets.

I am not ignoring the concept of 2p2 cash, though we may have different ideas about what that means.  Bitcoin is well suited to occasionally sending substantial amounts of value to family members or friends…especially if they live across borders which make transferring fiat much more costly and/or difficult.  However, it is not well suited for buying a pack of gum at the corner store (nor is there much need for a new way to pay for gum).
I believe bitcoin can have great success as an alternative to gold for storing value.  The competitive currency devaluation policies of central banks around the world benefit big banks, big government, and the wealthy class (who invest in stocks, real estate, etc) at the expense of everyone else.   Bitcoin offers a much needed way for common folks to preserve some of the value they've earned through work.  However, I also believe that if bitcoin threatens to substantially disrupt the profits of large banks (or government tax revenues) by trying to compete with popular retail payment systems like credit cards, it will be squashed like a cockroach.

I hold less than 4% of my bitcoin in off-chain services (Coinbase and Circle); it would be less if I were not still actively accumulating bitcoin.  I admit that higher tx fees would be more burdensome for folks who rely on p2p to accumulate bitcoin.  I suspect the volume of p2p  bitcoin/fiat trades is very small compared to the volume of trades on bitcoin exchanges. 
I do not think that bitcoin transactions that cost up to a dollar and take up to 24 hours would  contradict the concept of p2p cash.  I believe it is still a lot cheaper than alternatives like Western Union for sending money across borders.
Also, let's not forget that in America (and I suspect other countries), bitcoin has been deemed to be property, not cash.  This means that most transfers of bitcoin to parties other than yourself are taxable events requiring calculation of the cost basis of the bitcoins that were transferred.  Failure to comply with these regulations may invite more onerous government intervention.

I believe the value of a bitcoin could increase to perhaps one million of today's dollars within a couple of decades if we get bitcoin ETF(s) and investor demand (for a safe haven store of value) grows.  Without ETF's, exchanges, websites, or mining farms, I think the bitcoin price is more likely to reach ten of today's dollars.

I believe many if not most economists and economic policy makers are not smart enough to understand your point.  This reminds me of reports in the western press of economic policy makers complaining about there being too much "sideline cash" and how to entice this "sideline cash" into the stock market.  These Ph.D. holding dimwits do not understand that when you trade your "sideline cash" for stocks, the seller of the stocks now has your cash and the amount of "sideline cash" did not change.  [The insignificant exception to this concept is the purchase of IPO's.]

When Chinese exchanges charged no trading fees (and even incentivized trading by charging lower withdrawal fees for high trading volume customers), they dominated global btc trading volume.

Fine well-written article!  Hope you don't mind I posted it to r/BTC.  
I do think you overlooked an important point, however.   You refer to the market cap of Visa and PayPal as evidence of the potential value of increasing Bitcoin's transaction volume.   However, the profits from those business go to the owners/stock-holders of the companies; they do not go to the holders of the digital tokens of value (fiat currency) that those payment systems use. The currency used by those payment systems is nearly guaranteed to lose value over time. Therefore, the success of these companies is NOT evidence that high volume increases the value of a currency.

The utility of a currency as a medium of exchange depends on it's ability to store value, but it's popularity as a medium of exchange has relatively little effect on it's utility as a store of value.  Increasing the transaction capacity of bitcoin should not reduce its value unless it is done in a way that compromises the important attributes that give it value (i.e., decentralized, secure, open, censorship resistant, etc).

It makes no sense to compare the "market cap" of the USD to gold or Bitcoin.  The market cap of a fiat currency reflects how much debt (i.e., wealth borrowed from future generations) the elites allow to accumulate; the higher the "market cap", the less the currency is worth.  
In contrast, gold and Bitcoin are forms of money with a limited supply that are not based on debt.    Unlike fiat, their "market cap" is positively correlated with their value.

New proposed crytpo-currency regulations in Mexico would have the Bank of Mexico decide which cryptos qualify to be considered a "digit asset."  They will consider the crypto's market cap and technology.  An exchange operator claims that Bitcoin and Etherium would certainly be approved.
This governmental stamp of approval may enable or encourage institutional investment in approved cryptos, including their use by international remittance businesses.
Mexican crypto exchanges would not be allowed to operate with fractional reserves like fiat banks.  They would not lend or invest their customer's deposits.

In their response, Bitmain writes that Maxwell's proposed patch to disable the covert implementation of ASICBOOST "would be a loss for the patent owners."  Since Maxwell's proposal would not disable the overt AsicBoost implementation that was patented by the original inventors, they would not experience any loss.  This suggests Bitmain patented a covert Asic "optimization" based on AsicBoost, and they would experience a loss due to not being able to continue using it.
Bitmain also wrote:  "the ASICBOOST method has not been used by us on the mainnet. We have not seen any evidence yet on the main net that anyone has used it in the patented way."  This suggests that their covert implementation may slightly differ from what was patented.

Bitcoin was initially designed to be a form of money with features similar to gold…   It's value is dependent on scarcity, and it enables value to be stored and transferred between peers without needing to trust or pay financial institutions.  It seems to serve this limited purpose quite well…better than gold in fact.  However, I believe bitcoin is more susceptible to government attack than gold.  Bitcoin users need to trust that government(s) will not try to outlaw it or regulate/tax it to death.   Therefore, I would be wary of hard forks that would make bitcoin more capable of disrupting tax revenues and/or the profits of the large financial institutions that control national and trans-national governments.

Although China may want to prevent citizens from trading their yuan for Bitcoin, I see no reason for them to ban mining at this time.

@_date: 2017-09-20 01:34:10
Nice post.  The main risk I see is if China bans "unlicensed" Bitcoin mining or only allows Bitmain to sell their coins OTC or on foreign exchanges (forcing all other miners to join the Bitmain pool).  In this case, all Bitcoin mining in China would be centralized under the government's control.

I have seen no evidence that China plans to ban mining, and it would make little sense.  Miners are using cheap energy to produce an exportable commodity, benefiting the Chinese economy.  However, if it becomes more difficult for small miners to sell their coins, they may need to make a deal with a large well-connected miner (Bitmain) to get it done.  This could increase mining centralization in China.

I would review the properties of gold that have made it a preferred store of value for centuries:  scarcity, divisibility, fungibility, portability, cost of storage,  resistance to counterfeiting, etc.  Then I'd discuss how bitcoin equals or exceeds gold in these areas.  
Regarding the issue of scarcity, your article actually shortchanges bitcoin relative to gold.  Although there is a finite amount of gold in the world, we cannot predict with certainty how much will be mined each year.  We cannot predict what new technologies may enable the mining of gold from previously uneconomical or untapped sources.  There is also the possibility that we could someday mine gold from extra-terrestrial sources or that gold-laden meteors could shower the earth.
You also shortchange bitcoin on the issue of intrinsic value (other than its value as money).   I would observe that the industrial demand for gold is dwarfed by investment demand and the price of gold primarily reflects it's use as a store of value.  It can be argued that bitcoin has greater intrinsic value than gold due to its connection to an underlying technology that has many potential uses.
	
In the interest of honesty, I would also mention the ways in which bitcoin is inferior to gold.  Unlike gold, bitcoin depends on a network of computer hardware and software which may be susceptible to attack, failure, or replacement by superior technology.  Bitcoin's limited acceptance (compared to gold) and its association with illegal activity also make it more susceptible to government repression.   In addition, bitcoin is confusing and intimidating to most people...and not without reason.   Bitcoin held by people whose cyber-security practices are lacking may be easily stolen.
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:28:48
People who wish to use bitcoin to transfer money or make purchases should not care much about the BTC price if they can easily exchange BTC for fiat.  I believe people who primarily want to hold BTC as a store of value have more influence on the BTC price.  If these investors are feeling pessimistic about BTC (or relatively optimistic about alternative investments), the BTC price may decline while the number of users increases.
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:35:00
Bitcoin (the money) derives its value from its usefulness as a store of value and medium of exchange.  I see two ways in which governments could theoretically devastate bitcoin's value:  1)  Disrupt the computer network upon which bitcoin relies using direct attacks, and/or  2)  Prevent merchants from accepting bitcoin as payment for goods and services, AND make it very difficult for people to exchange bitcoin for fiat and visa versa.   I do not know how realistic these avenues of attack would be.  Regarding option  I suspect it would be necessary for all of the world's big countries/economies to outlaw bitcoin in order to really destroy its value.

Based on BobAlison's response, it seems that the median transaction data size may be less than a fourth of a kilobyte.  Since popular wallets default to minimum transaction fees of 0.0001 or 0.0002, this suggests the fee per KB paid for typical "small" (with respect to data size) transactions is much higher than is paid for "larger" transactions.  This would cause Bitcoin Core's fee estimates to show much higher fees than are needed if it works as you described.

After Circle stopped selling bitcoin, I opened a Gemini account because I wanted to support a Coinbase/GDAX competitor (and I personally wanted more than one option to buy BTC cheaply).  However, I found Gemini's website and policies to be less user-friendly, and their customer service to be terrible!   At one point, I had to post details of a problem I had with Gemini on a public forum and email them about the post to get them to even respond to my emails.  Gemini responded by limiting my USD deposits to $500 per month out of spite.  So I still almost exclusively use Coinbase/GDAX; I've found their customer service to be responsive, polite, and competent.
@_date: 2016-10-30 12:57:42
I believe those fees are for "instant" BTC buys and sells.  You may deposit USD to your Coinbase (or GDAX) wallet for free and then trade your USD for BTC on the Coinbase GDAX exchange for free (limit orders) or a 0.25% fee (market orders).   
@_date: 2016-10-12 10:51:06
Do you think the risk of hackers stealing customer data from Coinbase or Circle is much greater than from Wells Fargo or Chase bank?   I chose to accept this risk in order to pay less for my BTC using the Coinbase exchange.  You can still safeguard your BTC by transferring them out of the exchange after purchase.

It is reasonable to not want UASF.  However, it will happen on August 1 if the miners choose not to activate SegWit before then.  Therefore, it is in your interest to advocate for the BIP148 UASF if you are invested in Bitcoin.  Here's why:   
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:34:25
Does the wording of the leaked document clearly indicate they are not referring to BIP148?  Is "signalling at bit 4" or "2 MB hard fork" not compatible with BIP148?
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:59:21
The growth in Bitcoin's adoption and market-cap suggest this should not concern miners.  It is likely that demand for Bitcoin's wealth-storing capacity will exceed demand for its use in low-value transactions for quite a while.  Of course, passage of Segwit would be the best way (currently known) to prepare Bitcoin to meet the potential future demand for low-value transactions.

The idea that bitcoin's value depends on its usefulness as a medium of exchange for goods and services is wrong.   The only thing we need to be able to purchase with bitcoin is fiat.   As long as the bitcoin network is reliable/robust and people can easily exchange bitcoin for fiat (and visa versa), bitcoin will have value (like gold).   The illegal bitcoin economy may threaten this value by causing governments to make it difficult to exchange bitcoin for fiat.

Miners may fear Segwit will enable more off-chain transactions for which they receive little or no compensation.  Therefore, they may prefer most transactions to be on-chain, even though that strategy would greatly limit Bitcoin's transaction capacity and perhaps undermine its security.

What are the minimum computer resources, operating systems, and internet bandwidth needed to meaningfully signal for a UASF?

Thanks for your informative and reassuring reply.   Regarding my keylogger fear....   After creating my Electrum wallet, I actually decided to delete it (which took a while until I realized it was in a hidden folder) and create another one so that I could copy and paste the seed instead of typing it!   I don't know how to detect keylogger malware, but I do run the Avast antivirus program.
So far, I like how the wallet works.  My one complaint is that it only asks for my password when I try to send BTC.  I'd prefer that it require the password every time it is opened.  That way, a thief who steals my laptop would not know how much BTC he might gain by extracting the password from me!
I noticed the thread about Electrum 2.0 being released soon.  There was some comment about Electrum users being "stuck  in Electrum forever."  I assume that Electrum users can easily send their BTC to a non-Electrum wallet address, so in what way could Electrum users be stuck?

Thank you for your excellent testimony!  I am a Bitcoin minnow whose been hodling for just a couple of years. I do not have your technical expertise, but my lurking on r/bitcoin and r/btc soon led me to the firm conclusion that the leading advocates of the core roadmap were far more intelligent and sincere than their counterparts.  I also had enough knowledge of economics and the nature of money to realize that the other side's economic arguments were largely incorrect.  
I saw this year's PBOC crackdown correction as a buying opportunity, and I held firm during the ETF drama.  However, when I noticed in March that some intelligent and respected community members were taking the BU hardfork threat seriously (e.g., Vinny Lingham, Tone Vays), I got scared and sold nearly 15% of my BTC stash. So in a sense, I also fell victim to the Bitmain/BU propaganda campaign even though I never bought into it.

Many re-use bitcoin addresses which can be associated with their website, and addresses can contain identifying info.   If you transfer BTC from Coinbase or Gemini to a private wallet (e.g., Electrum) and use your private wallet to transact with disapproved sites, I think you'll be okay.

Handing over your personal info to Coinbase is probably about as safe as giving it to other FDIC-insured American banks.  [The FDIC insurance applies to your USD balance at Coinbase, not cryptocurrencies.]

Sorry for your bad experience using BTC.  I knew Bitcoin isn't ready for widespread retail use, but didn't realize it was this bad.  
I prefer to spend USD (especially for large purchases) and hodl my BTC because USD is inferior money and to avoid the need for record-keeping and paying capital gains tax.  However, I've been enticed by discounts to buy stuff from Amazon with BTC using my Coinbase wallet and PurseIO.  Due to their relationship, transfers of BTC between Coinbase and PurseIO are off-chain and free (though you can use other wallets with PurseIO).  Never had a problem with order payment.
Six BTC is a large amount to keep in a software wallet...especially one that is installed on a smartphone.

The implementation of SegWit means the value of your investment will likely increase even more because:
* Bitmain will no longer be able to use stolen AsicBoost technology to gain a huge unfair advantage in mining.  This should increase the security of Bitcoin by reducing mining centralization.
* Faith in Bitcoin's consensus and governance mechanisms will be bolstered.
* The nasty and harmful Bitmain/BU propaganda campaign will be quieted.
* The threat of a disastrous contentious hard fork will be largely eliminated.
* Network transaction fees and delays will be reduced, improving Bitcoin's user experience and utility as a medium of exchange.
* A new wave of innovation utilizing SegWit will be enabled, encouraging wider adoption of Bitcoin.
* Off-chain scaling solutions facilitated by SegWit hold the promise of enabling Bitcoin to some day compete (successfully) with fiat-based retail payment systems.

Bitcoin was designed to be sound, honest money (unlike fiat) that allows individuals to make peer-to-peer exchanges without trusted third parties.  It was not designed to compete with fiat payment systems that process individual-to-corporation (retail) transactions.  Segwit and other scaling improvements should enable Bitcoin to better compete with fiat payment systems in the future.
Another reason for Bitcoin's difficulty is the need to safeguard your BTC from cyber-thieves.  Also, exchanges that enable the trading of fiat for Bitcoin are subject to the rules and whims of government regulators and the traditional banking system, which can degrade or interrupt their service to customers.

I am sympathetic with your view of the critical importance of Bitcoin's decentralized security and stability.   My investment in Bitcoin has largely been in the hope that it would become a force of good in the world.  I believe it has the potential to increase financial freedom and opportunity (especially in oppressed populations), increase governmental accountability, increase business/charity accountability, decrease warmongering, and restore capitalism [ ].  Transforming bitcoin into a retail payment system that can compete with Visa would not achieve these goals, and is not the basis of my segwit support. 
You write that you want Bitcoin to have "no serious security flaws."   In my view, covert AsicBoost is a serious security flaw that has contributed to mining centralization in a country with an authoritarian and repressive government (citizens of mainland China probably cannot see our discussion without using VPN's, which their government announced will soon be banned again).   Segwit's "fix" of this security flaw is a major reason for my support.
Part of bitcoin's potential to increase financial opportunity is as a platform for permissionless innovation.   It is my understanding that bitcoin's transaction malleability bug has been a major impediment to innovation.   My support for segwit has been mostly due to it fixing this and other shortcomings in the bitcoin protocol. 
You do a fine job of highlighting the potential downsides of making any changes to the bitcoin protocol.  Though I agree with your points, I believe it is necessary to balance them against the potential benefits.   In the case of segwit, I believe the benefits strongly outweigh the risks.   Nevertheless, I would agree that "second layer solutions" are generally preferable and safer than forking the bitcoin protocol.  
I would be pleased if SegWit fixes all the critical bugs in the bitcoin protocol and unleashes an explosion of permissionless innovation, providing second layer solutions to privacy, fungibility, and scaling.   This would hasten the "ossification" of the underlying protocol which, as Andreas A. has explained, will be an inevitable consequence of widespread bitcoin adoption. 
I do not agree with the idea that bitcoin should only serve as an example of stability for other currencies (including fiat currencies) to follow and improve upon.   I think it will be a long time before any currency has a greater opportunity to do good in the world than Bitcoin.

They are closely related.  Segwit is incompatible with covert AsicBoost (a technology that exploits a flaw in bitcoin's POW), which Bitmain has been using to gain an unfair advantage over other miners and increase their control of the bitcoin network.

They would not give me change for a dollar bill until I provided proof of my identity and they were able to verify that I had an account with their bank (which all took a couple minutes).  The teller explained this was necessary because the US government requires that they carefully document all cash transactions.
I gave the teller permission to inform the FBI that I needed to do laundry.

I have heard bitcoin mining described as a lottery, with each individual machine/processor racing to solve a computational problem by trial and error (in addition to validating transactions).  Slower machines are at a disadvantage but can still get lucky on occasion.  Is this accurate?  
Do machines that are in a pool somehow cooperate while solving the problem, or does each machine work independently?
I know the difficulty of the computational problem is adjusted so that it usually takes close to 10 minutes to solve.  What happens when a machine gets lucky and solves the problem in seconds?  Does it ever take much longer than 10 minutes for the miners to solve the problem due to bad luck?

As a goldbug, I am inclined to consider bitcoin's pros and cons relative to the yellow metal.  There is little doubt bitcoin matches or surpasses gold in many of the qualities that have made gold a preferred store of value for centuries....provided BTC cannot be shutdown by powerful attackers.  
In the case of gold, authorities can outlaw its sale and possession, and could even steal some gold from people's safe deposit boxes.  They would encounter great political opposition, however, and could never shut down the black market for gold or destroy its value (without also destroying human civilization).  
In the case of bitcoin, I believe governments could criminalize it with less political opposition.   They could shutdown the online exchanges, prevent merchants from accepting BTC, and even steal some bitcoin from safe deposit boxes.   But could they do more?  Could they also repress the BTC black market and destroy bitcoin's value by attacking the network?

Your assertion got me to watch the video again to make sure I was not mistaken.  I admit that Wu's accent can be difficult to understand (e.g., he says "manners" instead of "miners"), but I did hear him say the following:  "we have kind of thousands of altcoins and definitely there will be some very interesting and a very good stuff comes out and I think this is important one that a, hmm, I think every, most of, or absolutely most of the (crypto)currencies right now have some kind of inflation….   Almost all, every cryptocurrency has inflation."  "Inflation is some new token is generated and injected in the circulation of the economy..."  "for POW chain in the past, all those inflation income belongs to miners."  Then he talks about how some coins have begun sharing the income with users who operate full nodes and said "this is quite interesting."  "The miners and coin holders are sharing the inflation revenue together, so I don't know how bitcoin can do that.  If we do it a simple way, maybe we can just do some kind of a soft fork to do it but a, I really don't know how to really do exactly the best way.  But this is something that is emerging, this new, I do believe is good."
I was not mistaken.

Your table seems to suggest that paying the "normal" .0001 fee would likely result in your tx having to wait 150 minutes or longer to receive one confirmation.  Of course, I could be misinterpreting the meaning of "x confirmations."   In order to make sense of your table, I would also need to know the probability of confirmation that you used.  For example, does paying 0.00044843/KB mean that the tx has a 90% chance of receiving 1 confirmation within 2 "confirmations"?  Or perhaps you used a 99.9999999999999% probability?

Coinbase:  web wallet, the most noob-friendly, requires ID verification, reputable and insured, they hold/control your private keys like a bank (unless you use their multi-sig vault which is less user-friendly).  They may close your account if you appear to be doing illegal or suspicious stuff with your Bitcoin (e.g., gambling).  Coinbase also offers easy ways to buy and sell bitcoin.
Blockchain.info:  popular web wallet, you control your own private keys, no ID verification required, they will not close your account for suspicious activity.
Electrum:  popular and light-weight software wallet that you install on your personal computer.  You control your own keys.
Ledger &amp; Trezor Hardware Wallets:  the best protection against cyber-thieves; you control your own keys.  You can use them with any computer that has an internet connection and USB port to make transactions.

This article implies that the state of bitcoin is unhealthy, but I think that assessment is a little oversimplified. 
Bitcoin is competing with assets like gold and stocks as a long term store of wealth, it is competing with fiat currencies as a medium of exchange, and it is competing with altcoins as a vehicle for short term speculation. 
It would be reasonable to argue that bitcoin is faring very well in the competition to be a long term store of wealth.  In the competitions to be a medium of exchange and a favored vehicle for short-term speculation, it is not certain how much a scaling compromise would help.  Therefore, I think it is important to avoid damaging bitcoin's utility as a store of wealth in pursuit of unknown gains in the competition to become a medium of exchange and a vehicle for short term speculation.

There is little difference between storing BTC on GDAX versus Coinbase (or Gemini), unless you use the Coinbase Multi-Sig Vault.  It is best to store large amounts in a hardware wallet for maximum security.
Gemini prices will be similar to GDAX (sometimes a bit higher and sometimes a bit lower).  However, Gemini charges a trading fee which can be avoided on GDAX if you use limit orders (that are not immediately filled).

Garzik's statement that the disabling of AsicBoost is "outside the scope of the SegWit2x charter; post-Milestone1 material" suggests that the Bitmain cartel's FrankenSegWit will not block covert AsicBoost like BIP141 and BIP148 does.

Let me offer an alternative view.  What may happen on August 1 will NOT affect the security of your BTC on Coinbase.  If there is a "BCC" hard fork, you may not receive a "BCC" coin (which may be essentially worthless) if your BTC is in Coinbase.  On the other hand, if your internet security skills are sub-par and your computer or smartphone are infected, you could easily lose your BTC when held in a software wallet.  Smartphone wallets are probably the least secure option.  The safest option is a hardware wallet.
If you transfer your BTC to a private wallet and there is a BCC hard fork, you will have 1.1 BCC in addition to your BTC.  If you are American, there is no exchange you can use to sell/trade your BCC.  If not, you would have to deal with a shady exchange in China.

I do not recommend using smartphone wallets like mycelium due to security concerns (unless you really need a phone wallet).  Hardware wallets (like Trezor or Ledger products) are the most secure storage option for non-experts.

Not necessarily.  China Coin would compete with or replace the yen as a medium of exchange in China.  However, if people hodl Bitcoin and spend ChinaCoin, then bitcoin would still serve to transfer power and wealth away from banks and the government.  
I do see a risk, however.  If ChinaCoin allows the government to track the ownership of all their currency, then they could effectively ban the exchange of their crypto-fiat ChinaCoin for Bitcoin.

I agree.  I believe they will try to use crytpo technology to eliminate their citizens' financial freedom instead of increasing it like Bitcoin does.  If they are successful, then even "democratic" governments will follow their lead.

Thanks for your post.  I believe the problem is worse in other forums (e.g., r/BitcoinMarkets) which have far fewer people with the knowledge or motivation to counter this funded sock puppet propaganda campaign.

The last time I compared the sell price on Coinbase (before the 1.49% fee) to the current sell offers on the GDAX order book, the Coinbase price was significantly higher.  I believe Coinbase has said that their prices are based on an index of multiple exchange prices, and not on the GDAX order book.

They would likely become obsolete (and/or outlawed) as a medium of exchange within the borders of China, but Bitcoin would not become obsolete as a store of value or "digital gold."

The fact that Hargreaves Lansdown already offers GBTC to its customers diminishes the impact of this news.  It's still good though.
