Thanks for responding so quickly. I didn't expect it to have a miner but honestly it's not a bad idea... Just make a free game and have it run a miner I nthe background to pay for the servers and such. I might even be more inclined to play games that just mine instead of paying.
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:22:36
What if instead of paying you just mined crypto while you played the game? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:06:12
Ok that's cool but why? And so I need internet to allow for difficulty scaling? How do we know they aren't mining coins with your computer as you play? 
Also how long till you think that games will have a crypto miner in the game.
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:50:50
My question was specifically about games due to the nature if games using a lot of cpu/gpu so you wouldn't even know if one was included.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:29:43
Did you understand the huge increase? Do you pretend to understand that you know why the bitcoin price is doing what it is? Maybe they are big players trying to drive it low? Maybe people got spooked from the drop and are selling more? Who knows?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:25:25
Yes! I got that one because it was cheaper than the Trezor. Honestly with 50 euro it's probably not worth it but hey If your gonna keep buying then why not. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:30:29
Best thing to do is google is. A paper wallet gives you a address for sending and one for receiving. Also make sure if you use a wallet to write down the recovery words. Put them in a safe somewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:36:24
No problem man, it's just when you plan on being rich anything less than that seems less. Just don't want people to get into this with the wrong idea, because those people are the ones that lose out and sell immediately when it dropsm
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:25:35
Yeah do you not see the 5-6 posts a day of people saying hey I just got in with $50 or $100 or even $200. I'm glad for you and I'm glad you got in early but it's not gonna get you rich. All I'm saying is it takes a lot to get a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:21:48
No you'll never have that available via VIA a nap because they don't want you to use gdax they want you to use coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:33:50
Do you realize that your comment completely agrees with my post?
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:26:16
Could be, but could also be only worth 10k. All I saying is don't plan on getting rich unless you put in a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:20:43
The more people that us e segwit wallets the lower the fees are for everyone that uses them.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:02:39
Sites like shapify or other ones just look up exchange coins.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:23:13
The best thing to do is to make a paper wallet on an offline laptop or buy a hardware wallet. But at 50 Euro it might be okay just to keep it on an app on your phone but beware any wallet you have connect to the internet can lose the money that it has.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:00:36
I think if more people knew about Bitcoin more people would invest in it you can actually make money off Bitcoin can't make money in your bank
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:33:02
Man I don't think you even read the post.... All I said was that you need to put in a lot of money to make a lot. All I'm saying is that you aren't gonna make "fuck you" money off $200. That's not to say that you shouldn't put it in Bitcoin just that you should put in more.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:13:14
By default nobody knows how they handle their coins. That's why you can't keep them in their wallets because you have no idea how to get them out in case it gets to that point
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:34:33
I'm not saying that, investing $100 into Bitcoin in the beginning and your now a millionaire. I'm just saying $100 probably won't make you a millionaire in 10 years but what the fuck do I know.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:28:36
I'm gonna uninstall Reddit from chrome one sec.
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:02:57
He's not saying it's not socialism, he's just saying that if you just say that your aren't giving the full picture. Obviously corruption and oil money failure have a lot to do with it.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:41:23
You don't seem to understand that if no one else is buying it, you could buy all 21 million coins for like $1. The cheaper the price the more I can buy. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:36:33
Yes he will dude, I would buy literally all the bitcoin at $ .00001 and so would many others. It actually could not go to $0 unless some problem happened that makes me and many others change how they feel about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:18:11
I would just like to point out that currently Bitcoin is inflationary, until no more are being created with ever block.
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:25:26
You don't seem to know how economics works. If it's at zero everyone would buy it for free you big dumb. I guarantee people would be buying Bitcoin at $.00001 so it can't go to 0
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:10:20
So I would just like you to know that Jesus asked Judas to betray him so technically Judas isn't really a bad person you using the wrong person to call him a bad person.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:47:10
They link to actual discovery and I believe you can even read it because someone translated it.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:53:24
Nope when I go to twitter it says I do not have permission to see this tweet, and if I create an account it wants my phone number so twitter can fuck off. They want my number but they dont have any customer service you can call... Like you want my number but won't give me yours?
  [When I login to my old account or make I new one I get this page](
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:15:03
But why did you tell me?
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:01:27
If you can buy this with bitcoin I'll buy it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:46:11
Dude what.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:23:00
I know this is the last think your thinking about but make sure you put more money back in bitcoin when you can. Never know when you will need it in the future!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:35:58
Just so you know floating Point notation is what it's called in computer science so it's not that you're wrong it's just that you're both right.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:07:28
My problem with Twitter is they hold you hostage if you don't make an account you can't see any of the post. It would be better to take a screenshot of the tweet and then just post a link if there is one.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:51:09
Thanks I tried this and it worked on my computer but not my phone. It must remember my phone was logged in because I still get it when I sign out.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:14:57
Yea dont buy bitcoin cause its gonna crash, but buy bitcoin because you know it will go back up.
What do you do now?
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:33:36
Lol man, I went to Catholic school as a kid and had to read the bible, this story is from the bible. I'm just trying to say judas wasn't the big bad guy that every thinks.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:01:31
Okay, now make them want it. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:42:31
Here's the thing I do, sell 50% then buy back with all the money you made with selling when it drops. Then you dont have to sell at the top or buy at the bottom and still make some profits. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:55:22
What I'm saying is even just to transfer any amount of bitcoin its around $1 (US). Unless you use a wallet to set your own fees. This is one of the issues that is preventing me from using bitcoin as my only method of payment. I don't want to go to the gas station and but a $1 bottle of water for $2 just because I'm paying in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:57:26
Well, glad to know it wasnt my fault.
They found the error within 14 minutes and reported it back to me:
OK, there appears to be a problem with our backend API as far as reflecting your correct balance. We are working on getting that rectified. Please wait while we correct things. I'm sorrt for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:28:27
Also on this wallet I sent some small amount with a super low fee on the 17th of October and these coins never showed up in either the sending wallet or receiving wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:00:15
Yea can't make money if everyone is already in on it ;)
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:02:02
This just shows that people that read the articles about bitcoin think it will go up...
I think it will go up, but that sounds like an echo chamber to me...
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:31:16
okay so I am still kinda a noob on android wallets, how am I supposed to get the TX id from samurai? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:46:13
 
That's the link to the transaction. 
Thanks again for your help!
Just got an email back from the support team, so I am waiting to see what they say. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:37:04
yea the only choice is to view the transaction which brings me to this link:   
or this one:
Again thank you for your help. I sent this to my ledger nano S that i just got and the 1 transaction made it though. Your advice is just wait?
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:14:37
Dude a lot of people haven't even heard of Bitcoin much less any other digital currency that failed before it.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:59:22
Why post this? Also its worse with bad grammar.
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:54:23
I hope you mean 50-100k not just 50-100 usd...
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:44:51
Link from the one transaction that sent:
I can post a screenshot of the wallet page, just gotta take one.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:32:29
Ok, but the comic says nothing about the ability to spend it... only that people dont understand or know about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:26:03
currently have .0074 in my wallet so there should be enough right?
The thing is the fee for all the transactions were the same but only 1 went though, this is why I am worried.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:03:26
Yeah cuz it's like a dollar for almost every transaction I don't get what you're complaining about you should have known this before you went and tried to spend $2.
I'm relatively new to bitcoin and I know that even if I'm trying to just send my brother $5 I have to set the fees really low otherwise he doesn't get $5 or of course pay for the fees out of your wallet and not out of the transaction.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:07:51
For the largest transaction.
For the smaller ones. 
This is the same address that I was able to receive the coin at, but only the one transaction. 
Link to show received transaction:
 
Also on this received address I can see what address it is from, this is my other wallets public address right or is it not as easy as that?
I used the QR code for all the payments, but I did double check the address.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:48:55
[Error I get when trying to increase TX fee](
[Choices when I long click a transaction](
As you can see only one of the transactions actually sent but they have all been deducted from my account.
I tried to tweet at the samourai wallet people and twitter blocked my account because I had to post 3 tweets due to char limit... Really stupid. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:32:29
You'd have to do it like this !(decentralized ==anonymous)
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:24:12
That's cancer lol
My favorite is !(!temp != !true)
