You could apply that faulty logic to just about anything... "Don't like slavery? Just leave the country!"
I'm not going to argue about whether people should pay tax or not but for you to call people who are trying to minimize their tax "greedy" is fucked up. It's not greedy to want to keep more/all of the money that you earned.

Not really. There are heaps of shitcoins but plenty of alts that are designed to solve issues that bitcoin can't or won't. Do one thing and do it well; bitcoin shouldn't attempt to do everything

There is something Google can do. They can properly police the websites that use AdWords. A phishing website violates AdWords ToS, and they can have their automated system check to see if it's a duplicate of the real binance and block it

Wanting to keep your own money is greedy now huh?

Both. I wanna make as much profit as I can, but I also want to be able to spend my profits with crypto

You're crazy if you think bitcoin, with a 200 and something billion marketcap, will outperform all alts.

Check OP's comment history, he's a pump and dump spammer. Downvote all of his posts and report him

And if the majority vote that they want to exterminate the less fortunate, rather than help them???

Just tell your next of kin where your seed is stored or where your paper wallet is hidden. Then they can head to Google to figure out the specifics of accessing the coins.

Even if it isn't, Stellar just rocketed 20%

Ignoring the fact that vegeta is commenting on his own price, I found this cool tee that was made for when bitcoin surpassed $9000 NZD last month, so it's even more relevant now

That's just... wrong. The wallet creates one address for BTC and BCH, which can receive and transfer either coin. No issues whatsoever.
I don't like BCH at all but this is just demonstrably false and misinformation.

They're hardly the first news site to do this. I've had a JavaScript miner on my site since August 2017...
