Instant settlement is possible with bitcoin. It's not 100% secure at that stage, but it's secure enough for many uses.

You can bend over backwards to make it a soft fork if you don't want to risk it being talked about too much and becoming "controversial".
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:20:36
This is why we need to increase the block size.
As far as I know these are real transactions, not some sort of stress test. It doesn't have to continue like this for to too long before bitcoin stops becoming useful for many things.
@_date: 2015-12-17 06:43:23
It's the basic law of supply and demand. People will pay fees because of their own self interest, to get a payment through. In fact, people have been paying fees for years with lots of block space available.
@_date: 2015-12-23 00:34:40
While it can be done as a soft fork, it seems that such a radical change should be a hard fork.
@_date: 2015-12-17 07:27:37
I understand the tragedy of the commons and I don't think this is that. 
Both sides of supply and demand still work. People want to use Bitcoin, so will pay for it. Even without hard limits, block size is not free so is it is effectively limited, making it scarce, and economics tends to work well with scarce resources.
At the simplest level miners can set a minimum fee that they will accept, something less than a cent would be low enough that people wouldn't mind and that's enough to support the network as transaction volume rises.
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:32:04
The dichotomy still exists, one camp wants an artificial limit on bitcoin, what economists call a "deadweight loss", the other wants the blocksize limit merely to act as an anti-spam measure, and have bitcoin participation grow as quickly at it can.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:28:12
Segregated Witness is a complex change, which requires changes to lots of other software in the ecosystem, like wallets. Just because it can be done as a soft fork, does not mean it should be.
@_date: 2015-12-17 06:19:20
That's exactly the point. Even with unlimited block size there is still fee pressure because you need to give miners a reason to process transactions. There is no need for an artificial limit.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:29:26
Well said.
@_date: 2015-12-22 02:10:45
Shouldn't SegWit which changes so much be a hard fork?
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:34:46
It's not inevitable at all. First-Seen-Safe Replace-By-Fee (FSS-RBF) provides much utility which increases bitcoin's value. Full RBF decreases bitcoin's utility which may decrease bitcoin's value.
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:32:40
So he has a financial incentive for Bitcoin to fail / perform poorly. Now I understand, thanks.
@_date: 2015-12-01 19:40:31
While you're right that zero-confirmation transactions will always be there, the point is that changes like RBF can make them unreliable and impractical to use, so they might as well not exist.
I really don't see why you'd cut off a whole lot of possibilities of Bitcoin use with RBF, it's like killing something before it gets off the ground.
@_date: 2015-12-02 07:36:06
What I meant was that unconfirmed transactions might as well not exist if RBF (not the first-seen-safe version) becomes standard. It's not a binary all-or-nothing thing.  Even though the contents of mempools vary, there is some consistency, and that consistency can be used to make a judgement call on how risky it is to accept without confirmation.  It's not perfect, but it is enough to work with.  XT's propagation of double spends is another way to gain certainty, but let's not get in to that now.
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:06:22
Instead of looking at the behaviour of random people in the "community", look at the behaviour of those involved in getting things done (devs), or those in leadership positions.
From what I see, the people supporting bigger blocks have been using factual arguments with data, whereas those that want to keep blocks small and fees high have been responding with lies, unfounded accusations, lack of transparency, and censorship of discussion. It's the "trolling" at high level that concerns me, not the behaviour of random forum members.

Why is this guy trying to reduce the utility of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-12-22 08:15:17
Isn't SegWit a big change that requires more investigation as testing? Isn't increasing the block size a much simpler thing to do?
@_date: 2015-12-22 02:36:16
There are some important core-devs not on that list. If not having "consensus" was enough to stop a block size increase, why is not have "consensus" OK for this?
@_date: 2015-12-11 23:59:06
A block size increase is still required with segregated witness.
Anyway, the current problem is partially caused by the miners only half-filling blocks, not sure how to solve that one.

I can very quickly download a multigigabyte file over the internet using bittorrent. This would equate to a block size hundreds of times bigger than today. That's also not including all the communications and storage improvements that would happen by the time we needed a block of that size.

@_date: 2016-01-20 00:18:09
So you're saying that the devs need to be paid. Fair enough.  They are doing this through Blockstream, that's OK too. What's not OK is them pretending to work for the good of bitcoin, when they have a major incentive to make bitcoin only work good enough to allow their sidechains (which is where I assume they make money) to function.
The better bitcoin works, the less relevant their sidechains become and the less money they make. It's not a conspiracy theory to see the conflict of interest here. They need to be transparent about that, rather than hide behind "it's for the good of bitcoin".
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:34:08
There are some basic things he doesn't understand about bitcoin blocksize. He mentioned in his blog post about block sizes that the only consequence of hitting the limit was that fees would rise above 2 cents. He seems to ignore the fact that if you have 20 seats on the bus and 25 people want to ride, increasing the ticket price still does not allow all 25 to ride. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:31:56
Satoshi always intended it to scale on-chain.  This blocksize debate is more about whether you want to impose an artificial limit now or not.
Miners can start mining the next block using only headers (until they receive the whole block), so the block size is pretty much irrelevant for that. So limiting the blocksize for bandwidth doesn't make much sense. Hard drives are now so big (and will be bigger in the furue) that limiting the block size for space reasons doesn't make much sense either.
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:02:26
You're right, it's just like how the internet can't handle video (or at least that's what they thought initially). It turns out that if you make the bus bigger, it can get really big without causing any problems.
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:47:35
It's not just about benefits, it's about costs and risks too. I don't think any sane person is saying it shouldn't be done. It's when and how that are the important decisions. Right now in a rush?

"if developers reach consensus" isn't entirely accurate.  The number of developers required to agree for a change to be incorporated varies a lot, sometimes it is very small. If the people with commit access on GitHub think it is a good idea, then it can go in regardless. "Controversial" changes are fine if the people in charge want it to happen. I can't find the quote, but I'm sure one of the core devs said something like "consensus does not mean majority" ie, we can have consensus if only a minority agree.  In fact, the amount of consensus required varies so much and is so arbitrary, it's like consensus isn't required at all.  It sounds like you are aware of the problem with this, given your extra questions about how consensus is reached, note that no-one has really addressed this in the comments.
Also, many miners just blindly install what Bitcoin Core releases, so they're not really making a choice, they're just following along.

There seem to be 2 different but related points in your reply.
1. Blockstream is a way for Bitcoin devs to make money.
2. Blockstream's business model is to make money of fees from pegged sidechains.
No 1. is fine.
No 2. is where I have the problem.  They seem to be using bitcoin as a loss leader / promotional vehicle for sidechains where they only need to make it good enough to handle the sidechains, nothing more.  The better bitcoin becomes, the less relevant sidechains are and the less money they make.  In and of itself this is no problem, but this is not transparent and stated up front, they are pretending to work on bitcoin for the sake of bitcoin when they aren't really.
Even if you think the scenario I mentioned is not happening right now, do you at least see that there is a conflict of interest that incentivises them to work against bitcoin once they've got their sidechains working?

If Bitcoin was working as intended, the transition backlog would go back to 0 after every block. Instead, it persists, rendering 0-confirmation transactions useless and making fees way too high.

He categorizes changing the max blocksize as a change to the Bitcoin rules, like changing the max number of Bitcoins.  That's way too far. Limiting the blocksize to push out non-spam transactions is the major change to Bitcoin's rules that we should be worried about.

I'd be happy if I was mistaken, I just don't see anything in your reply that leads me to see that. If bitcoin fulfilled its awesome potential as mentioned by Satoshi, what reason does Blockstream have to exist? 
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:30:16
Many core devs have a conflict of interest. They need to make the bitcoin network relatively slow and expensive or else there is no reason for Blockstream to exist. This is a fact.

It's not just political. It's some of the core devs subverting bitcoin to restrict it so they can make more money for themselves by providing services on top.  This is coming at the expense of higher fees, longer transaction times and decreased utility for the rest of us.

You're one of the people I respect most in the Bitcoin world with everything you've done to make Bitcoin more practical to use, and you seem like an intelligent guy.
I'm puzzled why you believe the Core devs still have Bitcoin's best interests at heart.  Given that workable, sensible solutions to scaling (at least for the short to medium term) were proposed several months ago, if not years, and they haven't acted on them, how do you explain their behaviour?  It's got to be one or more of ignorance, incompetence, or malice. Of course there's nothing wrong with ignorance, or incompetence regarding certain things, but as things have developed it's getting increasingly difficult for me to believe that there is no malice involved. Given their conflict of interest, what has led you to have such a positive view of them?

No, if everyone else is paying a higher fee and there are lots of transactions, yours will probably get ejected from the mempool.  It won't be there when transaction volume dies down, when the transaction fee would be high enough, so it won't get relayed, and is essentially lost.

Both those points you brought up are not realistic, which gives weight to my "Oftentimes the drawbacks are theoretical anyway" statement.
I'm not sure that escalating the costs of all transactions, as you suggest, is the answer. Also, this is not an either/or situation, increasing the block size to a sensible number still allows First-Seen-Safe Replace-By-Fee.

@_date: 2015-07-19 18:35:12
It's in the long-term interest of miners to support 0-conf transactions as instant payments make bitcoin much more attractive and will grow the ecosystem as a whole.  This will lead to mmany more transactions, including more fee-paying transactions.
In the absolute worst case, is there any incentive for miners to implement full RBF over FSS-RBF?  I can't see how full RBF would do anything other than rob the bitcoin network of much of its value.

@_date: 2015-07-09 00:26:46
From what little I know, it seems that some of the core developers have a financial incentive to move away from Satoshi's original vision, and the leadership is unwilling to make the tough decisions (that some core developers won't like) to fully realize bitcoin's potential without having to rely on other systems.
The current process of needing 100% consensus before making a change, which gives anyone veto power, is a recipe for disaster.  We're going nowhere fast. This block size debate has been raging for far too long, it should have been a straightforward change.  An debate summit won't change any of that.
Bitcoin development needs to have a structure similar to other successful open source projects that have leadership that makes decisions.
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:28:59
You're right about BDFL not being ideal for bitcoin due to the value of compromising that individual.  There still needs to be some leadership though that can move the project forward. "Design by committee" rarely works.
It's weird too, how no matter what the core devs do, the miners get to choose. It seems to me that miners getting the most money in the short term goes against their long term interests, and the interests of bitcoin as a whole (a huge vibrant bitcoin economy used in line with Satoshi's vision). I assume most, if not all miners won't be able to get past their short term interests.
@_date: 2015-07-22 20:30:22
Are you suggesting that we wait until the bitcoin network becomes expensive and slow and people stop using it, and then we increase the block size?
@_date: 2016-02-02 03:55:17
The people currently in charge of Bitcoin development want to keep it constrained so that it is necessary to build services on top of it for it to be useful.  Services where money can be made.
Others, want to adhere to Satoshi's vision of a "peer-to-peer version of electronic cash" where 3rd parties are not necessary. The're still happy for services to be build on top, but believe they should be optional.

That's premature optimization.  Stunting our growth in the precious early stages because we currently can't handle the volume we'll have in 20 years doesn't make a lot of sense.  By then we'll have figured out how to do things a lot better.

Not all contributors have equal power. There are only half a dozen people that merge code into master, where the real power is, and Blockstream is represented disproportionately there.

All of the necessary questions about raising the block size were asked and answered a long time ago.
Any real negative effects of increasing the block size are trivial compared to the benefits of increasing it. Oftentimes the drawbacks are theoretical anyway, while we are having real problems today with the block size that was artificially reduced by Satoshi to combat spam.

A closed door private meeting between powerful individuals is not consensus, and most certainly not decentralization.

Yeah, it blows my mind that companies like Coinbase which rely on  Bitcoin don't help fund its development. It's discouraging for them at the moment though as they would be very much outnumbered by those representing Blockstream's interests.

What about Satoshi's idea of p2p electronic cash? Many of us didn't sign up for a settlement layer.

With the variation in position titles it was hard for me to tell, hence the ? in the post title. Thanks for the clarification.

Well, this figure was **2** until very recently, my mistake.

This chart doesn't mean what you think it means, it says nothing about the long wait time for transactions that have yet to be confirmed.

2MB every 10 minutes is fine. It's just that some people would like you to think otherwise. The block actually needs to get to other nodes in a small fraction of the 10 minute window so that they can start working on the next block, but a 2MB block does this easily. (This is still true with a connection of 10Mb rather than 10MB).

Even if there was some agreement like this, it is still just "kicking the can down the road" and doesn't do anything to fix the "Fidelity Problem" where organisations would like to use the blockchain but don't because of concerns it won't have enough capacity.

Obvious bias here, they list:
"BIP100 Advantages" and "Negative Points about Bitcoin XT"
At the very least they should also have done the reverse for it to be a fair report.

When Bitcoin becomes uneconomic to use because of high fees, why wouldn't you use another cryptocurrency?

It was great to hear an industry veteran say this out loud:

This is wrong, BIP101 has a linearly increasing block size limit in between the points you show in the graph. There will never be a step change again after BIP101 is activated, which is much nicer to work with, no unexpected surprises when things change.
@_date: 2015-11-04 08:01:10
I forgot about the Blockchain Alliance.  I'm constantly surprised by the monumentally bad ideas that accompany Bitcoin sometimes, like that, and not raising the block size.
@_date: 2015-11-29 04:07:16
There are a lot of situations where accepting 0-conf transactions makes sense, especially low value transactions.  If you use something like Bitcoin XT's propagation of double spending transactions, it makes it safer because you know if someone if trying to scam you.
@_date: 2015-11-13 07:32:42
That analogy would make more sense if Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency.  Are there hundreds of different modes of transport for getting around LA?
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:18:16
I wasn't sure either. A bit of fun with extrapolation.

It's spelled elemEntal, as in, from the elements.

With the blocks getting so full, merchants can no longer trust unconfirmed transactions, as they may never get confirmed.

Still waiting for it to be available here in New Zealand.

I'm hurt by the limit put on transactions throughput much more than fungibility.

Great to see it spreading around the world.
