If you steal from yourself and a few other folks, it's still a net positive for you (since whatever you steal from yourself you obviously keep, and get to keep other's investments as well). I'm not accusing, but I don't see how saying that you're the biggest investor is a logical counter argument to the accusation that you may have pulled off the heist yourself to embezzle investor funds.

I know this is the but it's a bit discouraging to see everyone just say, "Don't mine!". With that being said, don't mine...bitcoin, but there are other coins you can still mine some with a cpu even if you're interested, and there are a plethora of coins you can mine with a gpu, almost all of which can be traded for btc. So, if you want to mine, go for it, just don't try and mine bitcoin directly.  
As for the how it works part, there have been lots of suggestions by people, but here's my three sentence explanation. You understand bitcoins are generated by "solving math problems", and everytime a math problem is solved, which is on average about every ten minutes, a block is created and added to the blockchain. Also included in every block are a list of transactions from the last ten minutes; this is how money/bitcoin moves around. The blockchain grows over time, and is a ledger of all transactions that have ever taken place on the bitcoin network.

There's only one alt that's actually implemented and activated segwit, Groestlcoin, and although Litecoin has implemented segwit, I believe they've also discussed adding a dynamic blocksize. There are several others that have announced an attempt to implement segwit - Vertcoin, Syscoin, and Viacoin - but afaik none have done so this far, so it's really far from all alts implementing segwit. Guldencoin is on a v13 codebase but has apparently chosen not to activate segwit because they believe it will never activate in Bitcoin and they don't want to diverge from the Bitcoin codebase.

I'm not saying that some of these pools aren't controlled by Bitmain/Antpool, but it's all conspiracy theory speculation at this point. It's also speculation that he doesn't like the Bitcoin Core developers, unless you have a quote substantiating that claim. And it's false that he broke the HK agreement - I'm pretty sure it was f2pool that "broke the agreement", so unless it's implicit in your conspiracy theorizing that f2pool is also an arm of Bitmain/Antpool, that is just not the facts as we know them.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:09:51
Vertcoin hardforked to a new algo after asics were produced for scrypt/scrypt-n, so it is still successfully asic resistant, imo. Of course any coin can remain asic resitant if it's willing to hard fork regularly, which probably becomes more difficult if/when the user base and inertia grow larger, but for the time being, vert is sticking to its guns, or GPUs if you prefer.

Then if your wallet is encrypted type:  
    walletpassphrase "your_pw_here" 3600
    
And then for each address that has a non-zero balance type:  
    dumpprivkey non-zero_address_here  
And that will give you a list of private keys. Then you open electrum, make an account, write down your seed words, etc., and then Wallet --&gt; Private keys --&gt; Sweep, and enter your list of non-zero private keys, and that should be it.

I heard next they're going to request naked pictures of your wife.

Afaik it is going to be an altcoin that will be launched by something called the electric coin company I think, which will take 10 or 20% of every block reward as company revenue.

It's beyond explanation, apparently.

It just requires a big ass PSU.

Yea I believe the owner started it in Minnesota, now it's incorporated in Wilmington, DE.

How is someone supposed to prove that they're not invested in a nominally anonymous and untraceable electronic currency?

They're willing to do whatever it takes to avoid a hard fork, including hard fork.

Afaik, you can also dump your private keys without being synced, and then just import them into electrum or something.

BitCluster...analyzes all of the Bitcoin transactions and regroups Bitcoin wallet addresses based on their incoming and outgoing transactions. This allows for a more accurate mapping of entities' online activities no matter how many Bitcoin addresses they are using.

Brb I'm starting a duck boat racketeering business that only accepts payment in BTC.

No, namecoin et al are forks of the bitcoin codebase, but they started with fresh ledgers/blockchains. Bitcoincash or whatever will fork at specified block height and maintain all previous BTC balances.

My thought was more along the lines of, "Wtf are they gonna do with a Bitcoin debit card when the banks collapse?"
But yea, doesn't seem to be a very well thought out plan...

Afaik they don't sell or intend to sell miners to anyone in the future, and they haven't taken orders for miners for at least about six months. Everything they produce is for their own mining operation.

Well, can't argue with their username. I mean, who doesn't love to drown koala bears?
