And then they killed him... "It's not paranoia if they're really after you" ? :D

Would wholeheartedly agree with you there :)

Technically correct.  I should have said Temple but to be fair a temple is/was just a generic name for a religious building and when we take into account that Jesus referred to the place where the money changers were doing business "my Father's house" one must assume that it must have been some sort of place of worship of who Jesus considered his Father (the christian God?).   
At any rate... it wasnt the trade they were engaged with specifically... it was the location they chose to conduct business which pissed the Son 'O' God off sooo much :) 
(I'm Pastor's Son... I sometimes payed a little attention... but its still my own interpretation of how that shizz went down)
    "And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves."

it should be integrated deeply enough with core code that every attempt to spend also checks with LND to see if there are "pending" already spent amounts.  more or less there are already these checks in place so it's just adding more check before allowing a spend.

The technical requirement to "pre-fund" the channel before any transactions can be made is IMO a huge PITA and will be a limiting factor to widespread adoption.  Wouldnt it make so much more sense to just check that unspent funds exist in at least one of 2 parties opening a channel and then for each spend in the channel verify again that funds being spent in the channel still exist in the originating wallet to match the LND transaction otherwise deny it.  The state of the blockchain and whats in the mempool is always known or at least could be known to the LND node so just verify before accepting LND tx's and allowing them to be signed and settle on chain when the channel is closed with full trust that each LND tx was checked to have backing funds before it was accepted "on the channel".   No?

Perhaps so, but i maintain that it was the location where it was taking place that he took the greatest offense to and not the specific act itself as there was all manner of thievery happening there other than just usury.   There are no accounts of Jesus going out into other parts of the city or any other city and attacking market places regardless of their shady business practices.  This story is highlighted (I believe) because of the plain and simple fact that they had (and i quote scripture here) "Turned his Father's house into a den of Thieves".

well to be frank yes... i haven't used or needed a pre-funded debit card or anything the like since i was in my twenties.  also in many EU countries we are almost cashless and most people don't carry cash for many years now or only a couple twenties for emergencies which actually never happen.  the idea of prefunding any type of spend is very foreign to us... prevailing payment method now in he EU is contactless paymen terminals where you just wave your card in the proximity of the POS terminal. 
There are also many other ways to buy bitcoin other than using an exchange.  i haven't used an exchange since 2011 other than to dump BTG.  Anyway we should strive for the best end user experience possible and not just say "well this is at least easier than dealing with coin base".  That's bad design..   
In the end i just think it would have been nicer to engineer a solution that didn't require prefunding the channel and that's literally the only real weak point i see in the design.

actually the real issue he had was with where they were doing it.  they had set up shop inside of the actual church where people should be worshipping and this is what angered him.

money laundering and cybercrime are not the same thing as tax fraud.

wth is going on here?  Why are setting stuff up on the top of there and why is there someone yelling at you when you take off with the forklift?   This looks very sketchy, man!

As far as i can tell,  this pool should suit both types.  Directly from the front page of the website i quote:
