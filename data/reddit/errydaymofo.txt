@_date: 2016-04-06 21:17:58


That's a bold and potentially entirely wrong statement. You're just stating opinions now though, so you can stop pretending their facts.


You can stop being condescending too because there's nothing to "get", you're not saying anything even remotely interesting, complex or difficult to grasp, just rambling useless opinions without anything to back them up. Opinions that are more than likely incorrect, according to the experts.
So, thanks for sharing (I guess?) but unless you've actually got something to back up your claims, then you're just wasting everyone's time.
@_date: 2016-04-04 06:08:26
So what you're saying is, it's okay to criticize Bitcoin when it has MORE security than the altcoin, but it's not okay to criticize the altcoin when it has LESS security? Gotcha.

@_date: 2016-04-04 06:11:30
No you haven't. You've been hearing it for months. Progress takes time, especially when working on a network worth billions of dollars. If you think the altcoin won't run into problems you're deluded. As soon as it gets even remotely popular, you're going to have a field day, and progress will grind to a halt.
@_date: 2016-04-12 08:13:59
ChangeTip is legit. I think a $5 tip is a good starting point for looking into how Bitcoin works and familiarizing yourself with it, who knows, you might find a new hobby. 
First thing would be to get the coins out of changetip into a wallet of your choosing: 
I recommend Electrum or MultiBit since you don't have to download the entire blockchain for those (which takes a long time).

Wrong. There's a difference between deflation and "lowering inflation". One is a reduction of the total supply, one is a reduction in the rate of increase in the total supply. Entirely different. A reduction in the total supply will ALWAYS increase price if demand remains constant.

Thanks. Can't say I'm surprised.
@_date: 2016-04-09 22:45:47


No, you're putting words in my mouth. It's a combination of a two that makes a project secure. You need the official channel AND you need the project to be open source, so that the checksum can be verified against vetted code.

It's not "hacking", it's bruteforcing, and people should really get the terminology correctly before noobs incorrectly start thinking Bitcoin is "hackable". For those who aren't aware, bruteforcing is the of generation hundreds of thousands of password combinations and trying each one with a script. The bigger/more complex the password, the less likely it can be bruteforced (in a reasonable time frame). By the way, his 20% fee is ridiculous.

The use cases for the altcoin have not gone anywhere yet either. You have no idea if that's going to pan out or if it's just mostly hype. So far there has been nothing ground breaking. Regardless, RootStock is around the corner, and we already have CounterParty. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 22:37:43


Yes, it fucking does. The open source version from the official channel works FINE. That's like saying I can't say the new Tesla car works fine because some car thief can steal a Tesla and sell it on the black market as "new" after fucking with the engine. They aren't the same fucking thing, not even close.

It'd be cool if you could mention the exchange rate on there somewhere, so that people can understand that 1000 BTC means $420,000 etc. Would increase the awe factor by quite a large amount I think.

It will be just as easy to make payments for the end user. Obviously the software providers will need to integrate the LN stuff, but there will be libraries for them to use so it will be very simple.

Why would you download source code from an unofficial source? That's just as stupid as downloading a precompiled version you clown.

The fact that Bitcoin is so heavily being attacked (and yet these attacks fail to deliver any meaningful impact) goes to show its resiliency, and the fact that other people deem Bitcoin a threat goes to show its utility. These attacks are nothing new, they don't accomplish much though.

But in all seriousness, I don't think anyone takes the FUDsters seriously any more. We've already seen time and time again that their BS is purely that, BS. And we already know that this sub is heavily brigaded. If you're making investment decisions based off random Reddit user posts then you probably shouldn't be investing to begin with. These months of consolidation has shaken out all of the weak hands.
@_date: 2016-04-09 04:22:51
Fair enough, but they don't have to be marketplaces like OpenBazaar, they can just be decentralized in nature. Once smart contracts come out (with RootStock) you will see a lot more of this type of development as well. It's a very complicated process to make a decentralized system like OB, they've been working on it for a very long time. Not only that, but it's a huge risk to spend years working on a business model that doesn't have a clear monetization strategy or is a free service.

@_date: 2016-04-04 07:21:26
I go for things with huge future potential that are flying under the radar, like Siacoin. They also need to have a solid, motivated development team. My criteria is usually:
* Are the developers motivated and committed to their project (regular commits, demonstrated commitment to community &amp; development)
* Are the developers technically experienced (have they worked on other large projects before, do they have sound technical knowledge to pull off their venture)
* Is the altcoin in a hype phase, or is it flying under the radar. Under the radar is preferred, hype is easy to generate and hyped coins are generally overpriced or at the peak.
* Does the technology impact many industries, and if so what are the combined market size of those industries? 
* Are there any upcoming technical challenges that may result in the death of the venture. Is the roadmap solid.
* What separates this venture from competitors?
Those are the main things I look for and what I think others should be looking for, but obviously there are many others.
As for your other post about "why not use all of those criteria?" Yes, you should. Market cap is obviously relevant, just not relevant on its own, and I thought you were saying that only market cap is a necessary ingredient to determine if an investment is worthwhile.

Good riddance. The Bitcoin Foundation was a waste of oxygen. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 08:27:54
Why do you feel like a jerk? Like you said, you were speaking generally... The sensitive ninny above you needs to get over herself. Not everything is about her.
@_date: 2015-12-09 07:30:17
Sounds like paranoia. There's a legal system they have to go through, they can't just rock up to court and be like "judge, send this man to prison because we don't like him", they have to have significant legal reasons and evidence to support them.
@_date: 2015-12-09 23:29:09
No doubt, but in the same token we're better off without guns than we would have been with them. Purely because they weren't already in heavy circulation. Taking the guns from Americans at this point is a losing battle though, there are already far too many of them in the hands of the public for that to be effective and it's already so heavily ingrained in your culture.  
@_date: 2015-12-10 08:36:30
I'm not sure about the PhD's, how could we verify them? Who knows if they're real.
@_date: 2015-12-09 08:12:45
Yeah, watch his Youtube videos, guy is clearly a fraud.
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:44:29
Of course there is bribery going on. It sounds like you're not disagreeing, you just said "they will find something on him, and nail him for it", which is synonymous with the fake charges I'm talking about. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 08:24:58
The John Strentz guy looks about 12 years old... Not really sure this is worthy of the front page. Also, the posts in this thread are really cancerous. Whenever this Feminazi tripe makes its way to Reddit, Youtube and Twitter, cancer is abound. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 07:28:47
More than likely.
@_date: 2015-12-16 13:40:53
And you would be wrong. But then again, you're on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, so why would we expect you to be honest about something that implicates your own business.
@_date: 2015-12-28 07:23:57
Good riddance, Coinbase sucks anyway if they're going to support XT and Hearn who is in the banks pocket. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:16:29
It's more than a nice find. It's irrefutable proof.
@_date: 2015-12-17 12:03:26


Do you have any proof of this claim? What makes you sure this is the speculative direction people are going in, opposed to thinking of its future utility as something else entirely?
@_date: 2015-12-09 07:26:58
After watching the guys Youtube videos I find it EXTREMELY unlikely that he is Satoshi. His personality just seems so far from matching it's not funny. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:14:41
This is Australia, not America. Our system is no where near as corrupt as yours. It's not perfect, but you're on a level of your own.
@_date: 2015-12-09 07:34:24
Pretty confident this guy is a major troll, and he got rekt by the AU police for it which is hilarious. Watch his Youtube videos, it's hard to believe a person like that could be Satoshi. The personalities do not seem remotely similar.
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:12:36
Except he isn't the real Satoshi, he's a con artist.
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:35:00
Raiding was related to all of the tax fraud he's committed. Guy is a con artist. The Bitcoin thing just put him on the radar is all.
@_date: 2015-12-09 08:15:01
Well according to Gregory Maxwell he doesn't understand the technicals of Bitcoin very well at all (when he was talking about ideas in the Bitcoin panel video on Youtube) and was waffling on to sound intelligent. That to me is proof enough this guy is a fraud.
@_date: 2015-12-07 08:26:52
It's really nothing alike.
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:16:15
Sounds like a fairy tale. You think the public wouldn't notice if something like that happened? No, they at least have to make fake charges, like child porn or terrorism or something, and they'd have to be backed up by fake evidence. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:16:02

It's both.
@_date: 2016-01-07 08:05:53
Right, but it's a huge inconvenience to have to manually go in and make a payment every single month. I doubt it would be very popular, due to this. I might use it myself if it weren't for that fact. Unfortunately recurring payments is one of the weaknesses for generic micro-payments, and I don't think there's a solution given the nature of the technology.

Going to have to agree to disagree. Hearn is the demagogue-en-chef, not Gavin. And from what I can tell, Gavin wants little to do with Hearn any more, probably because Hearn sold his soul to the bankers.


Hearn was the one trying to sell it, and Hearn was the one who called for himself to be "benevolent dictator".


Perhaps, or perhaps people just disagreed with you. There's no way to tell whether votes are genuine or not, and simply assuming it was votebots because you got downvoted is silly.

I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss. There's actually some merit to buying addresses with weight. Not for now, but in the future, they may be worth a lot.

You're high. It's extremely competitive. 5cents is practically nothing.
@_date: 2016-03-12 17:30:53
Sad, instead of just saying you can't speak about these things or something you decided to blatantly lie about it so you could long the market and profit off your own news. You realize this is insider trading right? It's illegal, you know that? Not only is it illegal, it's disgusting and despicable. You should feel ashamed of yourself,  you've just ruined my perception of your company and your authenticity and I can't wait for this to bite you in the ass.
@_date: 2016-03-07 12:05:24
Even if it wasn't (and it is), why do you care so much? Things evolve, they get better, embrace the future.

Okay. Let me know when you can buy goods online with gold, or even in a store. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 18:49:43


You're pulling numbers out of your ass. Not only that, but the stores that use payment processors usually have the option to keep their funds in Bitcoin if they choose.


No you can't. There's nothing instant about it lmfao.


I'd wager they wouldn't. I've seen plenty of stores that accept Bitcoin. I've not once, in my entire fucking life, seen a store that says "accept gold bullion".


And? It does not matter what it's used for, all that matters is that it is used. What does that have to do with this discussion, anyway? You're talking a lot of nonsense dude.
@_date: 2016-03-27 13:12:18

You're too early, come back in a few weeks.
@_date: 2016-03-31 10:13:24
Not true. It's a deflationary currency. People using it as a store of value will still increase the price of coins, no spending required.
@_date: 2016-03-27 06:00:41
So what you're saying is to teach this piece of shit a lesson we should all buy Bitcoin to fuck with his short position.
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:45:12
Ah, the question thing is a great idea. You should make that a requirement I think, that'd solve the problem entirely (provided they can't see the answer on Google maps street view, but that data should be pretty old).

rofl, no one here is going to vote for that retard.
@_date: 2016-03-27 12:34:41
Not if the assets are publicly accounted for on the blockchain. There needs to be transparency. The blockchain provides the benefit of immutable verifiability.
@_date: 2016-03-29 12:36:02
That makes no sense rofl. Why would you sell if other people are only starting to research how to buy? This is just another correction inside the wedge. We haven't broken the wedge support, we're still consolidating. The Google charts indicate a breakout could be on the horizon.

You read wrong. Vitalik has stated he expects over 1TB by the end of the year.

The difference is you cherry picked and took things out of context, my sarcastic replies are not "trolling", and my views are those of my own, unlike you who is being paid to be here and spend the entirety of every day all day posting nonsense, like the fact that you think gold is better than Bitcoin and is as simple to use, because apparently it's just as easy to mail gold across the globe than it is to do a Bitcoin transaction LOL. You can read yours in order and it reads like shill trolling. But I understand, you're trying desperately not to be seen as a shill because you are one.

I think what you're meant to say is "I'm shorting the market". If you really did sell I find it hilarious. This means literally nothing for Bitcoin (other than potentially good things now that he's out of the way), Hearn was nothing but a negative influence. Still, he's not really gone, this was all just bullshit propaganda by his banker corp R3CEV.

In defense, I don't recall ever being lied to about this. I think it was probably a perception I picked up from other people more so than OB, which was probably a result of them picking up the perception from the link between the old darknet approach and the new OB approach. But I've thought this way for a while now, so I'm not 100% sure where I got the idea to begin with. Anyway, in light of this I think both of your markets have merits, and I think you guys should get along because you can both learn from each other, you're both in the same space, and you're both working on good for humanity decentralized projects. Not sure why there's so much rivalry.

Most of the comments in this entire subreddit are negative. That's what happens when you have a sub full of sockpuppets.

Yeah, IF. Or the spread sheet could be right and he doesn't own those coins. It's easy to speculate.
@_date: 2016-03-24 04:19:46
Nope, not surprised. How stable the price has been in face of all of the negativity, sockpuppets and trolling is a testament to us being at the bottom of the downward cycle, otherwise it'd continue to drop. If anything it's great news, all of the weak hands have exited the arena.

@_date: 2016-03-01 07:13:37
No I wouldn't. Because there is always risk associated with stealing, no matter how small, and it just does not seem worth the risk for something so cheap. Plus I'd feel bad for doing it, (unless it was like a huge chain), so there's that.

It's amusing that you're being downvoted haha. Says volumes about how manipulated sentiment is in here. People actually want others to think these are Satoshi's coins and he's getting cold feet or something, as if even if it were true, 50 Bitcoins was going to kill the entire system. LOL. For what purpose they want people to think this, I do not know. Short term attempt to bring the price down for the block halving rally? Bitcoin XT/Classic FUDsters? Angry Buttcoiners who want to see Bitcoin fail? Government/bank intervention? Altcoin pumpers (ETH)? Bitcoin sure has accumulated a lot of enemies simply by being successful. Quite sad really.
@_date: 2016-03-08 11:55:23
Yeah, that's very possible. I don't think even Satoshi even remotely dreamed his coins would be worth the amount they're currently worth, and at the time it was so easy to obtain them he probably don't think twice about it. Like the guy who spent thousands of Bitcoin buying a pizza for example. Nobody has foresight that great, not even Satoshi.

Ship has sailed, that pump and dump has already ended (or is still dumping). I made a great profit on it on the rise up, but now my coins are back in Bitcoin where they belong. That's what the smart money did, the dumb money is still holding ETH (and losing money as it continues to dump).
@_date: 2016-03-08 05:54:31
People DID switch from Bitcoin to ETH, but not because it does not have scalability issues but rather because it was being pumped, and they wanted to ride the wave for some easy profit whilst all the hype was going. Now that ETH is being dumped, those people will move back into BTC because it is the safe haven (hence the current price rise). I'm sure a lot of those profits that were made during the ETH pump and dump will be used toward the Bitcoin block halving rally. It's all rather transparent really, no one honestly believes ETH is the solution to all of the problems, only an idiot. Like you said, ETH has WAY more problematic scalability difficulties to overcome. Not only do you have transactions, but you have all of that bloatware bytecode on the blockchain. It's a sleeping time bomb. Yeah, ETH is interesting and all, but it's only a baby and once all of the pump Euphoria wears off people will realize the enormous hurdles they need to overcome to even come close to competing with the tried and tested titan that is Bitcoin.

I'm a Kraken user, and he really should say something. It needs to be fixed... Hire some competent engineers to optimize their server or software situation, because this is ridiculous. I don't trust Poloniex at all, but their systems perform WAY better than Kraken's do. Kraken has trust, but it has poor systems. The only reason I'm still using Kraken at the moment is because I value trust over performance, and because I'm trading ETH. If it wasn't for those things, I'd be using Bitfinex, who I currently use for my BTC trades because they have excellent support and their systems operate without a hitch. As soon as BFX adds ETH I'll be moving over there, unless they can fix their server issues.

I'm confused, what's the point? We send a tip, and then we get 90% of our tip back at the end? Or is it divided equally among all users? In which case, people who tip more basically donate their overhead to everyone else? But then, you're taking 10% on top, so if there's less than 10% overhead then you're getting it all, and we're actually getting less back then we sent in.

Not true. These are two entirely different things. These custom CSS classes ONLY exist in your subreddit. Try it yourself, try and collapse Luke-Jr's comment, you will see that it does not work and behaves as if it is bugged, then try and collapse your own stickied comment, it works just fine. These are two seperate things I'm afraid. To be honest, you probably weren't even aware Theymos was doing this, so I don't hold you responsible, but I had to mention "and mods" otherwise everyone would say that I'm only targeting Theymos and I have no proof that it was *only* him.
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:12:13
Well obviously you agree, we can tell by your 3 paragraphs after that. It's pointless to say "this", just makes you look like a tosser, as if your implying your opinion is somehow more relevant than everyone elses, and everyone was holding their breath to hear what seven_five would agree with.

Fair enough. Well for what it's worth, after reading the comments between you and brighton36, I think he's being rather unprofessional. 


So to clarify, you're saying that people trying to sell illicit goods on OB have the potential to be caught by the authorities? What sort of protections are you referring to when you say it's lacking, I'm presuming the hiding of your IP address since it is not using the Tor network? It's the only thing I can think of, because everything is encrypted otherwise, correct? So say that is true, it sounds like it would still be possible to do so by using OB by tunnelling through Tor. As for coin mixing, that can all be done on external sites anyway, so that isn't a weakness as far as I'm concerned. 
By the way, myself and all my friends always thought that OB was going to be basically Ebay, but with the ability to securely trade things the darkmarkets would trade, so this is news to me. I do also thing a lot of people from the Bitcoin community are still under this impression, and I do think a decentralized market that does allow for the sale of these goods is needed in society (since the darknet markets run off with funds and get taken down).

I think your metric is off. It does better in bigger economies because they have more purchasing power to buy Bitcoin and the luxury to make investments opposed to the smaller or suffering economies where the average citizen has barely enough currency to be able to afford food. Food is more important than Bitcoin to someone who isn't eating. However bigger does not does not equate to healthy, the US economy is far from healthy, it's just stronger in the sense that it has great purchasing power for the time being and a lot of assets. But the utility Bitcoin has in weak economies is far greater than that of the utility it has in strong countries (take Greece for example). Since there is already so much wealth in the strong countries where Bitcoin is popular, if their economy was to suffer, all of that fiat currency would need to be moved somewhere as a hedge (or it would lose value). It's happened all throughout history with gold, however now we have Bitcoin as an alternative hedge.

Just for the record theymos, I contacted the admins asking if breaking Reddit functionality with CSS is against their rules, and I was pointed here: 


The admin told me:
"It is a bug with their CSS that they are working on fixing. If they were not working on resolving it we would have an issue."
So I hope you do plan on getting this resolved, and not just ignoring it, because not only is it against Reddit's rules, it's extremely annoying and especially frustrating for people who have no idea how to disable the subreddit theme.

Holy shit, this is so cool! But I would have liked to see the part where the person who left the tip left a message and/or a link to a website and/or an ad or banner or something. The video left that out. Also wouldn't people be able to fake their location to collect all the coins? You could get away with this by only showing them on the map if they're close by, but even then people could develop a bot that scans the map for locations by moving their faked location along the coordinates.
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:09:47




Yeah, but it doesn't do you any good if your server IP is known to the entire world... OB + end-to-end encryption = confidential AND anonymous. HTTP server + SSL certificate = confidential, that's it. No anonymity. Entirely useless for a store of such nature. Like I already stated, the only solution for that would be Tor (or an equivalent).


No I'm not. Define "public record of your ilegal activity", because that means very little. You don't have any public record if you aren't moronic, that's the entire point. Of course LE can charge you, but it doesn't mean it'll hold up in court. And it won't, unless they find evidence at your househould or on your own computer equipment to support their charge.  


Wrong, that's completely absurd. Since when do the innocent have to prove their own innocence? The burden of proof is most certainly not on you, it is on the prosecution. Innocent until **proven** guilty. I suggest you familiarize yourself with the basics of the legal system.
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:22:14
Sure, but you're painting malicious intentions by claiming that OB is trying to pretend to be something it's not by lying to people, and I don't see that to be the case, at least not as far as my mistaken perception was concerned. That was a result of hearing it on the grape vine, I believe. Not from OB directly. Anyway, I respect both of your projects, I think they're both cool. I have a greater appreciation for DZ now than I did earlier, because I see the different directions you're taking and DZ is more in-line with my own philosophy, and if it does turn out that OB really cannot be used for contraband then your market will be the only decentralized market (to my knowledge) to fill that gap.

But it's not just fractious individuals we have to take into consideration. There are plenty of individuals who simply have differing opinions, and they should be heard without being outcast as individuals who are trying to do "nothing but misrepresent the other persons arguments and appeal to demagoguery". Gavin is a great example of one of those people, he has a different vision to that of the "Bitcoin Core devs" but his arguments are technically sound and founded under a wealth of experience and technical expertise. Of course there are shills at play, but I think they're outweighed by the genuine people. I'm really not seeing a large amount of infiltration and brigading, contrary to the image the mods want to paint in our minds. Censoring genuine discourse is not an adequate solution for dispelling these shills.

Okay, well it seems evident it's not working as intended if Theymos is going to reorder the comments as he sees fit. It has the effect of censoring people below the huge comment chains (which is according to you what you guys were trying to fix to begin with). Also, the functionality in itself is ridiculous, in what world does disabling comment collapse let people be heard? All it does is make the thread difficult to navigate. If you cared about letting people being heard, all you would need to do would be to have hidden low score comments default to collapsed, you wouldn't need to actually break the collapse functionality entirely. What would be the point of that? Surely you can see how little sense that makes?

Personally to me it does not matter if people think it's a great investment as much as it matters that that the technology has a large amount of innovative applications, and it does. The belief in it will become a product of its successes, and that will come with time as more and more startups enter the space. It has the ability to revolutionize so many different industries it isn't even funny, so I'm long on that fact alone really. Yeah the price is largely driven by speculation, but

Of course there is a use for altcoins, laundering stolen Bitcoins is a great use for them. The Cryptsy thieves could easily get their stolen coins out by converting them to LTC and back on BTC-e. Then there's the fact that it can be used as a hedge against Bitcoin, and as Bitcoin becomes more popular this will become more apparent and useful.

Current market value is not a threat, future market value is a threat. The potential is the threat...
Whilst they do offer nice protections, that's only a reflection of their assets and not a reflection of their technology.  There will be companies that spring up that offer the same protections but use Bitcoin instead, thus removing a reliance on the existing centralized financial infrastructure and as a result reduce costs for consumers. Also not sure what you're talking about when you say they pay you to use them, you pay processing fees that negate those salespitch benefits, and you also pay interest.  It's not laughable at all, you just need a bit of vision. It's like you think Bitcoin is just going to sit here and twiddle its thumbs... Now that's laughable. You must not realize how fast this industry is evolving. 


The banks have been building up their infrastructure for over 100 years, Visa in particular has been in business for 58 years. I didn't say it was going to happen over night, but don't dismiss the possibility. Decentralization is the future. These centralized financial sector businesses are a dying breed

It'd be wise to change your voice so that you as the fraudster are not identifiable though (if you were ever caught). I don't think a makeup job (or a mask) would be too much work. There are online stores that let you 3D print them from a picture for pretty cheap. If you could make a few grand from it it's still highly profitable and easy money.

Because it's missing security features, mainly end-to-end encryption (which I believe OB has, correct me if I'm wrong). You could do it on Tor, but then you're getting into more complicated waters, Tor is pretty slow and not very user friendly for non-technical people. Also your customers would be less likely to use your service over something like OB because you're the one hosting it, they have no assurances you aren't going to steal their funds.

What? It's literally instant through your brokerage account? Then you have fiat in a brokerage account, it needs to be transferred to your bank account which will take at least a day. Also, if you're doing that you're not converting gold to fiat, you're converting shares to fiat, or gold derivatives. Neither of those are gold, and if the economy tanks you could lose all of it.  The only safe thing is to own physical bullion, or Bitcoin. Physical bullion is inconvenient, Bitcoin is not. Physical bullion cannot be used as a medium of exchange ONLINE, Bitcoin CAN be. Moving physical bullion is a slow, expensive and extremely dangerous manoeuvre, moving Bitcoin is fast, cheap and extremely secure. The benefits of Bitcoin over gold are obvious, and if you can't see that then no amount of pointing the obvious out to you is going to change your mind.
Anyway, this conversation is boring. Gold is old money, it is old news, Bitcoin is the future. Technology and the digital age is the future. Decentralized, heavily-interconnected networks communicating at the speed of light are the future. Not heavy, bulky, physical chunks of metal.


For the record, it does not take an hour or two for four confirmations. At most it would take 40 minutes. Also, waiting for 1 confirmation is safe these days, so really it should only be 10 minutes. But whatever, waiting an extra 30 isn't going to kill you. I wonder how long it takes to Fedex some gold across the globe, if it even makes it through customs?

Well different goals require different technology, so I'm not surprised there is a separation, although in most cases you would hope that "decentralized" would imply there need not be one.


Personally I do prefer the sound of DZ, if that's true. It does seem to me like OB has been marketed better so far? This is only the second time I've heard about DZ, opposed to the many many times I've heard about OB. Is this a result of funding, personal efforts, or what? Are you a DZ dev, by the way?

The blockchain technology (tailored to banks) has the potential has the potential to be incredible for them if they can manage to coordinate and agree on a system, globally. But do not underestimate the difficulty in doing that, that's a MAMMOTH undertaking. But if they can, they'd be able to remove so many trust aspects they currently rely on within the current infrastructure. Settlements could become extremely quick to process for banks &amp; customers, no more waiting days for international transfers or basic account transfers for example. No more reliance on "does this bank have the funds to pay us back" for inter-bank communication. 
But the thing is, as far as the world is concerned, it'll feel just like the current system but with faster bank settlements. People will still have little trust for banks due to their past transgressions, the banks will still be in debt, and as the economy worsens banks will continue to be seen as a threat to society. That's not going to change. So even if they do manage to pull this off, it's not going to kill Bitcoin. They'll run side by side, and Bitcoin will be seen as an investment opportunity like gold -- as a hedge against the current fiat economy, provided it only retains its currency related functionality.
BUT, if the Bitcoin devs can get their act together and innovate the system even further, opening room for a whole slew of innovative and revolutionary decentralized blockchain startups, it could revolutionize the entire world and the financial sector. As a result of this natural evolutionary innovation, banks will die out to these decentralized alternatives for trust reasons and through price competition. So really, I don't see the banks winning in the end, even if their dream is realized. There are a few threats we need to be concerned with though:
* Centralization of mining power
* Lack of incentive for nodes
* Scalability (the current large battle taking place)
* Developer/community disputes &amp; differing opinions in future direction
I don't think these are going to be big enough problems to take down Bitcoin though, so I see it winning in the long run. Now, there's also another big threat, and that is a radically better technology and PoW presenting itself and overcoming Bitcoins market effect. But, the devs could adapt to this, and if it's a big enough threat make changes to the current Bitcoin system more inline with that direction. If that's not possible due to there being vast differences, then it's possible this new technology wins out, but it will need to be decentralized to compete -- so it'll still be a huge benefit to man kind, and if you can see it coming you'll be able to buy in cheap and ride that wave to the moon anyway. So all in all, the future looks good, I think.

Putting aside the absurdity of the hack that you've done, it's extremely simple to have the behavior you desire without breaking everyones Reddit, provided you have this level of control over the div:
Change "collapsed" to "noncollapsed", remove the "collapsed-for-reason".
If you don't have that level of control over what classes the divs have, you can alternatively copy all of the CSS from the "collapsed" classes and put it into the "collapsed-for-reason" class using the !important tag to override the "noncollapsed" class behavior. Shouldn't be hard at all. I'll see if I can come up with a solution.

Here you go, try this:  -- I tested it on the thread with Luke-Jr's post.
This fixes the child comments being hidden (it hides them now). It also fixes the expand/unexpand of the "below threshold" comment, and defaults the comment to visible. 
You'll see that the comments underneath the below threshold comment still can't be expanded/unexpanded, I haven't figured that part out yet, but this still fixes like 50% of the problem. I fixed the colors in the titles as well. This will at least make navigating threads more bearable.

Not to mention, I've worked for a large payment gateway (owned by MasterCard now), their max throughput was something like 5TPS, so if Bitcoin is improved it has the potential to wipe them from the face of the Earth. To think they wouldn't be at least slightly concerned is ridiculous.

You're not getting it. Like I said, try it yourself... You can't deny what I'm saying, the proof is literally right there. Inspect the element, look at the CSS classes. You can stop trying to explain this away now, it's simply not true. 


What? You just tried to say that they're the same thing, now you're agreeing with me and at the same time denying what I'm saying? You need to be more clear.


Not seeing the relevance? Like I've already stated, this is NOT default behavior. This is CUSTOM CSS, that ONLY exists on YOUR subreddit. 


Now you're getting somewhere, but like I said, this is still not default behavior, it's selective (not a global rule, as we can tell by the specific comments that have been affected, not just ALL low score comments), it's custom CSS, and coupled with the fact that Theymos is reordering the posts adds to the fact that it is intentional manipulation. Not to mention that there is a HUGE difference between having low score comments default to collapsed versus BUGGING the collapse behavior entirely (which is probably against Reddit's rules to begin with). Your explanations just do not hold up I'm afraid.

It's really frustrating, and I'm 100% with you. I fully support Core, I want them to retain in control, I do not trust Gavin and his group (mainly because Hearn was involved to begin with and look how that turned out). But it's like they aren't even willing to give a millimetre of wiggle room and instead would rather force a hard fork because they're stubborn. It's really sad to see, all of this drama could be fixed almost instantly by a 2MB patch, and then they could continue to work on segwit and whatever else for future scalability. I don't want to transition to classic, I really don't, but why is Core forcing our hands like this? We want to see a slight compromise, and then everyone will GLADLY stick with Core with no problem at all.

It's not absurd. You're representing a company, you want to instil faith in your users. You don't do that with school yard antics. Anyway, it was just the impression I got when reading the discourse, i.e.:
Accusing OB of swindling its core audience and patronizing them. I don't really see it as patronization, more so just being professional and respectable. Perhaps we have differing opinions there and you want to take the Trump approach though.
And then there was the thing about them ripping off Shopify, which seemed like an exaggerative insult.

It does work for minimizing the parent comment, but it does not minimize the children comments underneath the parent comment because I haven't added that yet. Should be fairly straight forward to add that though, someone just needs to continue what I've done and add in the children comment selectors in the same fashion. It's an annoying process though, I will give you that. Still, I'm not convinced it's a great hack to begin with, not only does it break functionality but the merits seem non-existent. The only rational explanation I could think of would be that the comment voting was being gamed, but I don't see any evidence for that? Also you're hiding scores, what purpose does that serve?
@_date: 2016-01-26 03:53:04
So how do they maintain seeds of the torrents?
@_date: 2016-01-13 09:55:15
Yeah. It works because in the minified version there is a new line after " comment hiding", I believe. Otherwise it would probably be treated as an ID selector.
@_date: 2016-01-14 17:59:00
We've already tried this, splitting the community up into multiple subs, I'm under the impression that it does not work. It creates division, and is literal division. Not sure how we're going to get unity from division? The only thing that's going to result of this, in my eyes, is giving the mods an excuse to censor people. Unless we can magically move all 171,000 people from this subreddit onto that subreddit as well, I do not see it reaching the goal. We can't force everyone to subscribe, and there will be many people who do not know the subreddit even exists, so it will not achieve the goal because people won't be seeing the threads.
If this was to go ahead, at the very minimum you would need a sticky on the front page of for a while letting people know that the subreddit exists, and recommending all users to subscribe. Still, I think instead of that it'd just be better if we could talk about it here. Personally I don't want to subscribe to yet another Bitcoin subreddit, I'm already subscribed to and because I get to see things that don't make the cut here due to censorship, it's starting to get cumbersome. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 08:56:42
Maybe, but I still don't trust him. He's too close to the bullshit, and he seems to be close to Hearn and that to me is extreme cause for concern.

Made some progress. If you add the following classes (and remove your custom collapsed-for-reason classes) it will allow expand/unexpand of the hidden comments and default to open: 
Also need to add the stuff for switching the colors, and probably some child comment tweaks, but it's a good start and fixes the main problem that you were facing.
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:47:06
That's a good point about litecoin and other coins. I didn't really define what I meant by collapse, but I did mean a collapse of central banking and the stock market and the influence of the USD on society, so it sounds like we're on the same page.

As soon as the moderators (in particular Theymos) wake up and realize that all of his censorship efforts (i.e. trying to prevent BitcoinXT brigading and whatever else) have been doing WAY more harm than good, we might actually make some progress. If all of the recent frontpage posts aren't an OBVIOUS proof of that, I don't know what is... Jeff Garzik outlined what needs to happen today in his [proposal for fixing r/bitcoin moderation policy]( 


Until we see this moderation policy taking effect, the anger over censorship is going to continue, and it's going to continue to divide the community. It's now time for Theymos et al to stand up, be the bigger people, and bring the community TOGETHER. If it doesn't happen, it's just going to get worse and worse until people really do start migrating away in numbers, or one of the alternative forks is adopted by the mainstream PURELY because of the actions of the moderators of the Bitcoin community. It's time to stop treating the community like stupid children who aren't intelligent enough to make decisions for the greater good, because that is what is currently happening.

That's a very short sighted attitude. Banks do give a fuck about Bitcoin, or they wouldn't be collaborating under the R3CEV banner. Bitcoin is even worse for credit card processors like Visa and Mastercard, who work very closely with the banks. The devs need to get their scalability plan together to be a threat though, but if they do, the potential is incredible.

v/bitcoin is run by BashCo, who agrees with Theymos about censoring XT stuff. He stated it himself in one of the threads that blew up, so I really wish people would stop recommending voat. There are alternatives subs, either /r/ btc or /r/ bitcoin_uncensored. Take your pic.

I think BIP101 is a better approach. This gives people with money the ability to screw with consensus to create their own pools, or bribe pools, for example, and then use the decentralization for nefarious purposes.

That's not true, owning and using dollars makes you an integral part of the economic system. Without it, the economy would collapse. This goes for both Bitcoin and dollars. You don't care about the users who use Bitcoin as a store of wealth (which happens to be most of them), only the technology. It's a ridiculous stance and not in Bitcoin's best interest. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 01:49:27
You don't get it, it's not a matter of 'prioritization'. It's not a balance he's upholding. What you're saying is perfectly reasonable, but that's NOT what he's saying. He has NO interest in the coins value. ZERO. That means, something that would make a minor technical improvement to the code but entirely kill the value of the coin is deemed something that is desirable. So please tell me, how is my stance ridiculous and dangerous to Bitcoin? What a joke.

In case you haven't noticed, the general sentiment towards your company is not good. Keep it up and you'll go the way of the dinosaur. Seems like you need to make some internal policy changes before it's too late. I've seen so many companies (especially Bitcoin ones) ignore this sort of thing, and they ALL fall. This is your opportunity to turn things around. Do you like having a job? Then make your execs aware of this sentiment.

So what's the consensus? Who has more shills working for them? The XT camp or the anti-XT camp?
@_date: 2015-08-14 04:24:18


That's singular priority. It implies you have attributed zero priority (i.e. not simply lesser priority) to Bitcoin's value. There's a difference in approach between:
* Highest priority: Bitcoin code, lesser priority: value.
* Highest priority: Bitcoin code, no priority: value.
In the latter, you would be okay with my example. In the prior, you would not. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 00:11:09
Of course it affects us. He is a heavy influence on the core devs and Bitcoin's direction. 


Oh well, that's why we have @_date: 2015-08-13 23:47:13
Luke-Jr specifically told me in the wizards channel that he does not care about the value of the coins. He also stated that Bitcoin's value is irrelevant, that his job is not to ensure that Bitcoin remains valuable, and that Bitcoin should not be treated as, and is not, a speculative asset. 
Whilst I understand that perspective to a degree, he should still care about those points, because they are a highly important aspect of keeping the technology popular, among other things. In a sense, keeping the shareholders happy. But, apparently he doesn't care about the shareholders. It's a very worrying position and I was blown away when I heard it. 
When I pointed out to him that his position would be entirely different if he owned some Bitcoins he didn't even want to acknowledge it. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:43:09
This, please. The article makes it sound as if you put up some Bitcoin and a project of "build a website that does X and Y", and then somehow that was passed along a chain of 500,000 people to end up with a finished product in minutes. I mean, I can see how it would work in theory, but the logistics of it seem almost impossible. And, if I'm even remotely correct in my understanding, then that's still $5,000 if you only paid each person 1 cent for their contribution. $5,000 for the website you've got seems overpriced. How do you convince someone to work for less than 1 cent per "task"?

Few questions, I hope someone can answer them please:
* Are the proving keys transmitted over the blockchain or stored on the blockchain?
* If not, how are they transmitted, do clients make direct connections between eachother to relay the information? 
* Does the blockchain facilitate that connection handshake? 
* Why is Bitcoin required at all for any of this, merely for the payment aspect?
* What are the benefits of this over a traditional escrow service, what can this do that escrow cannot by the middleman human validation of the exchange?

What? No. Just no. 10 cents to open/close a payment channel? Useless. What's the point of a MICRO transaction payment channel if the cost to open and close the channel is not micro. 10 cents might not sound like a lot, but it is a HUGE amount for a ton of applications that are yet to be made and will revolutionize many sectors. And they're yet to be made because of this barrier.

Well the block size isn't really similar to the solve rate, one is storage of transactions and the other is how difficult it is to find coins.

Well maybe they should be. If the pilot doesn't think the new planes are safe but is forced to fly them anyway because the CEO wants to cut costs then the consumer is negatively affected.

This would be revolutionary if it weren't for the limitation of opening/closing channels costing around 10cents. Otherwise, you have to do dollars worth of storage at a time to make it cost effective, and very very few people will have a requirement to do dollars of storage at a time (which should work out to be gigabytes and gigabytes of data, considering how cheap storage is). Due to the cost effectiveness limitations of these micropayment channels they're rather useless for these types of applications. I really hope we see something better come along, or these types of apps will never have an opportunity to become mainstream.

The cost for open/close of a channel is wayyyy too high. 9.2 cents is ridiculous and all of a sudden lots of the awesome things you could do with this technology are now too expensive. Do BitcoinJ microtransaction channels have these same open/close costs? Because I swear they didn't.
Another thing, I hope you plan on making your library support SPV, otherwise it's mostly useless for a lot of applications since the size of the blockchain is so large and storing it on all the devices around the world you want to implement this sort of software for is infeasible.

This is correct. However, if you factor in that you mine rhenium at a slower rate than you can mine gold, that equation now changes. If the rate at which you can mine rhenium is much slower than the rate at which you can mine gold, it introduces another factor into the equation. Same for if you could mine rhenium at a faster rate than you can mine gold. How fast do you exhaust the total gold/rhenium supply of the planet? How long does it take for all of your miner company buddies to be out of a job? This is where this comparison falls over, without this important factor. They're all important pieces to the equation, and without them you're not getting an accurate answer.

Maybe he's doing her a favor by picking up the flowers for her dying aunt you heartless monster?!

It is easy to play the market...
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:21:29
This is the Bitcoin community, it's always rife with cynicism. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 15:54:15
Two different things my friend. One is about predicting future news, the other is about creating sensationalized news to play the market. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 01:00:16
lol @ the phd and y2k guys. These people are fail.
@_date: 2015-09-21 18:29:52
Good idea in theory, although isn't there mountains of legal blockers preventing people from opening banks?
@_date: 2015-09-11 05:16:18
Of course it is, if only partially. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 18:30:54
Sounds like Merica. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:20:18
I like this idea because I don't trust Windblows or the hardware on my system. As Bitcoin becomes more and more popular, we'll either have to start transitioning to open-source software and hardware, or we'll have to start using third parties to store and manage and transact with our coins. Unless you don't mind if your coins get stolen, of course.
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:22:09
Did you actually want an example, or did you just want to argue?
@_date: 2015-09-21 18:24:39
This should be illegal. Fuck these criminal scumbags. How does one take legal action against them?

Just got off the phone with Janet Yellen, she said the Fed is going to move all of its holdings into Bitcoin. Say goodbye to the USD.

This website is actually terrible. You go to wallets and it gives you a single option for every category (desktop, etc), what the hell?
@_date: 2015-11-11 02:49:04
The dream is dead. Now we wait another 2 years to hit $500 again.
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:27:59
This seems premature.
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:45:04
Brian Armstrong shorting?
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:13:26
Ah its this circlejerk again? Where is when we need him. You're not even posting anything, this should be considered spam. This isn't twitter.
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:42:18
I thought BitMex was a scam?
@_date: 2015-11-11 02:53:20
It's kind of terrible really. Way too complex. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:49:18
My break even point is $6. I'm hodling.
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:28:04
Orly? Who would have thought. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 02:56:21
A politician said something. Cool news bro. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:52:09
You're the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, I think you might be slightly biased. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 05:16:36
Eh, I have to agree with Theymos on this. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 05:05:38
I imagine he's both.
@_date: 2015-11-18 02:18:09
Here, let me fix your chart: 
@_date: 2015-11-07 14:44:08
Shouldn't need to uncheck that... They should be enabled automatically. The fact that there isn't just goes to show that this isn't a good replacement subreddit. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 07:36:45
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:43:56


Exactly. Turns out he was right all along. The fear porn does nothing for progress, the devs are aware of problems if they arise and solutions will be worked on, but for now there's no issue. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 11:41:14
Use a different exchange? There's plenty of options.
@_date: 2015-10-27 01:47:26
You wouldn't know if it's a whole person, they would be too small to see.

The person who made this site is actually one of the Litecoin devs (thrasher). He's a great fella.

It's really not dumb at all. In fact it's quite intelligent. Perhaps you're the dumb one for not getting it?
