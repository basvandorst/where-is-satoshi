Wouldn't it just be easier to steal from banks in that case?

What I'm saying is if money isn't speech then we have the issue where me making a political comment on reddit for example isn't protected because I've spent money in order to exercise my rights to speak freely (via purchasing an internet connection etc).
It wouldn't work with our legal system and that's why the decision went the way it went.
It's all fun and games to joke about "Muh corporations aren't people lelellelel" but the principle stands that using money to enhance your speech is a protected right. Groups of individuals also retain this right as each constituent member has said right individually.

Money is absolutely speech though how in earth could anyone deny that.
If I support Bernie for example and I want to point out some flyers in my printer to hang up around town I have the right to do that even though this means I am turning money into speech.
If I then elect to go to kinkos and pay to have even more flyers printed up that again is me just exercising my rights. Just because it costs some amount of money to do it doesn't change that fact. I'll never understand reddits weird hardon with citizens United when money absolutely is tied to speech inherently.

Any speech is protected from the government regardless of medium.
The first amendment gives you protection from retribution by the government but anyone else (such as private companies) can censor you all they want. The 1dt amendment still applies in reddit, but it only stops the government from censoring you.
