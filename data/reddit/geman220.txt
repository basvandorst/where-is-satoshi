If you're worried about your money being loose I'd keep your money in a wallet or rubber band to keep it tight.

I have no money in Gox, but this is the most obvious troll ever.  Look at his reddit submission history.  I'd love for you to explain to me how you found this "leaked" document.  "
In Japan, a CEO cannot resign until a new CEO is nominated." - lol what?
This whole thing is hilarious.

Yes it is.  It's not all doom and gloom.  We don't need suicide hotline numbers.  We don't need "to the moon!" posts.  Sometimes you just need a little bit of silly.

No one can give you honest advise on your financial situation, only you can make that decision.  That being said I buy .1 every 2 weeks regardless of the price.  However with prices so slow I bought .3 more today.  Even if it doesn't pan out I'm not going to lose my house or car over it.  Taking into account the amount of times BTC has taken a blow like this, and recovered even stronger, I think it'll be fine.  But who knows.

Why is this article written so poorly?
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:51:32
I honestly don't think anyone there knows what's going on besides Mark and possibly Gonzague.  AFAIK they just had a small group of support people for customers that I'm sure are just as confused as everyone else.
@_date: 2014-05-12 12:07:58
Can someone ELI5 how you operate a Bitcoin ATM.  I understand how it works as a customer wanting to exchange fiat to BTC, but I'm not exactly sure what the operator does.  Do they go and collect all the cash and send it off somewhere?  Is this ATM deducting from a wallet owned by the operator?
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:33:27
TLDR for everyone; "I don't have an iPhone and feel I'm entitled to one so I'm mad you broke it instead of giving the phone to me!"  Get over yourself.  People decided to destroy items that they purchased with their hard earned money for a cause they support.  There is absolutely nothing wrong here.  These people have all the right to do whatever they want with their personal property.  The whole world isn't a damn charity Jesus Christ.

What is your point here?  Are you trying to imply that bitcoin isn't bleeding edge?  Do you think 7 years is a long time?  Especially for a huge paradigm shift.  Stop drinking the kool-aid and come back to reality for a second. 
I'm all behind BTC and invest quite a bit, but all this nonsense about past charts and trends is absurd.  BTC is still in its infancy and anything could happen.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:11:53
No it doesn't make perfect sense.  Investing in bitcoin is like investing in a bleeding edge startup company.  The tech may be awesome, it may change the world, and it may make you rich.  But it could also do none of those things and you could lose every penny.  You can't assume just because less BTC will be released that the value of BTC will go up.  If the market share and adoption doesn't grow all the scarcity in the world won't make any difference.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:14:39
No way man, if you look at this one chart over here you can see that we are perfectly in some curve that confirms prior history of good things happening.  So it's pretty obvious that now that exact same thing will happen again, it's pretty much confirmed.
@_date: 2016-06-19 21:03:27
@_date: 2016-06-20 04:27:26
Basically this.  It's just a weird angle.
@_date: 2016-06-22 17:49:11
Yes I am saying exactly that.  How long do you think it takes to bring something to mass market and have high adoption rates.  Comparing bitcoin to stock is comparing apples to oranges.
@_date: 2016-06-22 05:46:51
There is no pattern.  Anyone who claims that there is a pattern is fooling you and themselves.  There is no way to predict what will happen, you invest in something you believe in and hope that it works out.
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:50:15
Why does it matter?  BTC could be worth 1,000,000,00,000 and you could still just buy .00000001 BTC.

lol wat.  You'll almost certainly get a better deal on the property with cash ready.  You don't have to worry about mortgage interest rates.  You would outright own an appreciative asset.  You wouldn't have any sort of mortgage or rent payment monthly freeing up large amounts of liquid cash for investments.  You could eventually rent the property and have steady passive income.  The downsides?  You lose some tax breaks and mathematically you would get a smaller % return on investment as the value of the house goes up.  
Let's assume he bought a house for $100,000 and in 10 years it has appreciated to $200,000.  If he bought the house outright he would have a 100% gain, if he put 20% down on a $100,000 house he would have a 900% gain, but he would still owe $80,000 principle at the start of the loan, and in 10 years he would have paid off around $57,000 leaving a balance of $23,000 on the house.  So...  He could then sell the house for $200,000 - $23,000 - $12,000 realtors fees = $165,000 That's a 785% gain from the initial investment of $20,000.  Sounds great!  Except he actually invested $57,000 (payments) + $20,000 (down payment) = $77,000 so **159% gains.**
Now, if he had no mortgage and invested that $500 mortgage payment every month, in 10 years he would have around $76,621 with a 2.5% ROI adjusted for inflation.  So, by buying the house outright, he would have a total of $276,621 after 10 years if he sold the house, or **176% ROI** from the same amount of money.
So feel free to explain to me how only idiots buy a house with cash.
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:03:54
Buy a house in full, first and foremost.  You don't want to spend money on a depreciating asset like a car, if you are trying to reinvest the money wisely that is.  I don't know what you're paying in rent now but if you bought a house you could save somewhere around $14,000 a year not having a mortgage or rent payment.  That's a lot of money to reinvest yearly.  You should use this opportunity to completely secure your financial freedom for the rest of your life.  That's my opinion at least.

Again, just because you can afford it doesn't mean everyone can.  If you buy Starbucks every morning already this now means you are doubling your Starbucks budget.  Just because it's the cost of a cup of coffee a day doesn't mean you now don't have that original cup of coffee debit.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:37:03
So you want us to believe they are holding ~4.4 million dollars from you and all you've done is "ask for support" and post on reddit?  No lawyers?  Wouldn't filing a lawsuit be one of the first things you'd do?  You are either:
A) Lying and making the whole thing up.
B) Afraid to bring lawyers and potentially law enforcement into it because there is some sort of shady connection.
Also, who keeps 1200BTC on an exchange?  Nothing you've said seems even remotely believable.
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:20:50
That's $152 a month on average.  I'm not saying that is an absurd amount, but for some people that's a lot of money, it could be like taking on another cell phone or car payment.  Just make sure whatever you invest you personally can afford to lose.

So you think difficulty would be in the 9 billion range by then?  I thought it changed at about 1% per day currently or 7% a week.  I understand no one can predict the future, I'm just trying to make educated guesses.

It is, just a personal preference :). Just remember you CAN NOT have enough backups. You'll be kicking yourself if you lose your wallet.

I just checked prices thinking I was about to buy a lot more BTC but price is still over 1k USD.  I must not understand the word "crash".  Still got another .1BTC though.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:54:57
Agreed.  These posts about suicide prevention are well meaning I suppose, but absolutely ridiculous.  If you bought in thinking you're gonna be an instant millionaire then you deserve to lose money.  Personally, I'm excited to be able to buy larger quantities of mBTC on my weekly buy.
Protip: if you truly believe in BTC, set an amount you can afford and buy that much BTC weekly regardless of price.  Mine is $100.  Sure that doesn't buy me tons of BTC but I realise it will be a while before BTC reaches it's potential value.  And by that point I'll have a nice little stash of BTC.  If you keep this attitude "crashes" aren't bad, they are just a sweet chance to get some more BTC.  
See you in 8 months when we repeat this whole process again.

Send me your messed up hard drives and I'll recover the wallets. :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:00:27
Can you elaborate on this please?  At current difficulty I would make 0.4951 BTC per day @ 600GH/s.  Now I fully understand I don't have the card right now and I might not have it for a year.  But for argument sake, let's say I got it tomorrow.  How would this not be worthy of the investment?  Why exactly would I need to invest $20,000 into mining equipment?
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:20:55
So how would you suggest I generate more BTC?  I really don't want/care about the USD.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:18:35
I understand your point.  I just thought it would be better to focus on generating BTC not USD.

I don't want to play like a day trader.  I think in the future I will be able to make any/all purchases with BTC.  I hope that USD would be irrelevant so any method to generate more BTC would be more valuable to me.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:01:03
I know they have a bad reputation, but I'm honestly more concerned with "is mining worth it".
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:06:54
So the issue I have battling in my head:
* I buy $6500 USD for 10 BTC value goes up - great I have more USD but no more BTC.
* I buy a 600GH/s miner I can now generate BTC
Now let's say BTC crashes for years worth $5 USD.  Buying BTC I have $50 and 10 BTC.  However if I mine I could potentially have ~20 BTC or whatever.  Even though it's still a loss I've still generated more BTC.
