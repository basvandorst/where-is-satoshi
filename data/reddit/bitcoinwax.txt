Hey Canton, 
 Thanks for the kind words about my bitcoin wax sealing kit.  I think the seal looks excellent with your envelope design.  This sets the standard for giving a bitcoin paper wallet.  Nice work!

Thanks.  I came up with a Black Friday Deal and submitted it to that site.

Sorry I don't offer custom engraving, the cost would be much more.  I have not received an email, did you try contacting me through reddit or the website contact page? 
EDIT: I found an error in the contact page of my website.  You should be able to contact me there now.

Thanks Canton!  I think a Wax seal would look great with that design.

If you want a unique wax seal all you have to do is swirl two colors of the wax together.  It creates a marbled wax seal that's entirely unique, and impossible to duplicate.

Can you give me more details?

I wish my garage had CNC machines then I could work from home.  The garage was just for my photos.

Thank you for your feedback.
The purpose is multifold 
 Wax Seals are the original means of tamper evidence.  When a private and public key are printed on the same piece of paper it's best to have the private key sealed in a tamper evident manner.  Paper wallets are one of the most popular methods for giving bitcoins to family or friends this is an easy way to convey the importance of keeping private keys secure to people new to Bitcoin.  It's also gives an otherwise bland paper wallet a lot of personality worthy of a gift.   
I don't claim to be a website designer.  Do you mind messaging me what you don't like about the website?

Thanks Canton. Your paper wallets were an inspiration in making the wax stamp.
