No. When there's a sell wall at X price. People that are really eager to sell are placing their orders below X. And a big sell wall often cause some panic. It could drive the price lower.

This is exactly what the whale wants. For example, when he put a 1000BTC sell order at 19500. People will panic and try to sell them below 19500. More and more people will do that, and pull the price down.  
  
Since almost all the sell orders that are being cleared are not the whale's. He isn't really selling anything.   
  
(if the price catch up. He can alwasy just bail)
  
When the price reached a desireable low price. He will buy a lot of them. Then push the price up in a instant. People will panic buy to push it even more...  
  
This is the pump and dump happening in the minute/hour charts.

No, market cap is easily manipulated in altcoins. In some altcoins some power is able to manipulate the price while that power is holding a majority of the coins.   
  
For example, my imaginary Geoff Coin have a total of 100 coins. I hold 80 myself. With that amount of holdings I have a big influence on the price. And that manipulated fake price x all 100 coins is the market cap. So  market cap of altcoin AND Bitcoin doesn't mean shit.

Sometimes a whale just put a big wall there, so he can suppress the price for a while for him to buy some cheap coins. 
  
When he's done. The wall just disappears. 
  
This is one possible scenario. And it's common practice here.

But usually during a asset bubble. Their employers, and upper stream of their industry is all joining in the bubble. Rich people are getting high on the bubble, and putting too much at risk.  
  
When the bubble burst. Companies fall. The whole thing cascades. Normal people get laid off. Lose their income. Could no longer pay their monthly payment. Lose their home.

Actually maybe not a good idea... Most people won't buy Bitcoin until it's totally necessary. If that ever happens.  
  
Just, don't let too many people know that you are into Bitcoin. I've seen so many stories on this sub. It usually doesn't end well.   
  
If they already knows. Tell them in the future how you sold all your Bitcoin to pay the down payment of a house.
  
If you trust them 100%. Good for you. Deep trust between friends and family members is a precious thing. Otherwise I strongly recommend against it.

@_date: 2018-09-30 02:54:28
Here in China, people often borrow their down payment from other people. Mostly rich people doing these. They are rich, then they use their status to borrow a huge amount of money from friends and family, even other companies, then they buy a lot houses just to sell them at a higher price. A lot of factory owners even just pause all buisiness to do this. It usually ends well for them tho.  Until sometime in the future it doesn't.

Bitcoin is backed by the fact that no one is in control, only cryptography, which is math. And Bitcoin is trustless, all you need to trust is the math-backed protocol. It's better than fiat, because you don't have to trust a group of people behind it.

Since it's actually just a translation of an earlier announcement. In the original announcement it uses 任何所谓的代币融资交易平台 (any so-called token financing trading platform).  So it means any platform that helps ICOs finance themselves.
And it's effective immediately. Which should have already be in effect since the original announcement was out few days ago.  
  
There shouldn't be any change as far as this announcement is concerned.

Chinese government is trying to enter a short period of deflation right now. Since last October it is getting harder and harder to get a mortgage loan. More accurately, this is a short period slowing of inflation.  
  
The rapid inflation in these years is causing some real problems. But slowing it down in this situation will not save us since the economy is not coming up. So after this, they will definitely start speeding up inflation again.  
When you say? There is no timetable. But everything has already started. It is constantly happening. There is a Chinese proverb "it takes more than one day of cold to freeze the water three feet deep."
The more we experience the trend, the clearer we will see the future.  
  
Edit: once the government started to try a deflation policy, then we are almost at the end game. Since with all these debt, deflation will only make things worse.

I'll try.  
  
1. Rich guy has 500BTC, and he borrows 2500BTC. He prepares to sell them at 4600.
2. He pays a news site to say China bans Bitcoin. (Few minutes before the news, he's already started to sell his coins)
3. His coins sold average at 4450 or so. And people panic, bring the price down to about 4200 or even lower.
4. He buys a lot of coins at the lows.(since he sold high, then buys low. And he has so much coins, and news sites on his side, this is easy money for him)  
  
Just do your own calculation on how much money he could make by doing this.

First off, I don't believe cryptocurrency will go mainstream that soon. And that means what you're saying is pretty much a long way into the future. 
  
In the future, I think people will choose to directly fund specific government projects with subscription based micro-payments. The projects that we don't like won't get funded. And government will spend our money transparently since everything is on a public ledger.  
  
Without the sufficient funding to support a big government. These organization will disband overtime and a new way of governing ourselves will emerge.   
  
These are just my cryptocurrency utopia thinkings.

I had the exact feeling after I bought at the start of this year.  
  
Totally freaked out. It was a freaking scary dive. From 1160 to 760 in about a week. I panic sold at a lost and vow to never touch Bitcoin. 
  
Then I learned more about it after I came back from a vacation.
  
Glad I bought in and hodled from March.
  
Well, after that I still frequently freak out. But I never sold. I just buy more when the dip is really really bad. It served me well. But after everytime I bought the dip. I always wished I should've bought more...

The network is pretty young, a lot of the nodes are not sufficiently connected or the channels aren't well funded. So sometimes it fails to find a route to reach your final destination.
  
I did 3 transactions so far.  
1. A channel connected to a random node. Tried to pay at bitrefill ,failed. Seemed it couldn't find a route. 
  
2. A channel directly connected to bitrefill. Bought a 10 Euro steam voucher. Instant success. 
  
3. I used the same bitrefill channel to pay for bitcoinshirt LN test. Automatically did its routing, took 30 seconds to succeed.

Actually, you're only partly right.  
  
Home prices go up because more people are buying. More people are buying homes becauae there are more loans to go around. Because banks are feeling confident, so they allow more mortgage to be created.   
  Why banks are feeling confident? Because government is allowing them to be by creating more money in the system.
   
If you can't get a mortgage, you're more likely to not buy a home.  Or for some rich people, no mortgage means they can't buy more homes they can't afford.
  
The whole bank confidence thing was what lead us to the 08 financial crisis.

You can store numerous copies of paper backups wherever you want. Since you can add another layer of "encryption". The mnemonics in your TREZOR generates a wallet. You can add a passphrase that you memorize at the end that generates another hidden wallet. That way, even if someone stole one of your copies of backups. They still won't get your bitcoins.  
I know it's not very convenient... But it's pretty secure.

- Private key is generated on the device.  
- It's a closed system. Nothing can read unallowed information on it. 
- Transactions are signed on it.
- PIN is scrambled and shows only on the device.
- if people steal your device, they need to try out PINs to bruteforce it. Each try lengthens the wait time. Trying 30 times will take 17 years.
- If people steal it, and knows your PIN, or even saw your paper backup. You can have a passphrase memorized. So that without it, the theif won't see your hidden wallet.

I think he meant global economy is going to plummet.

This is where the fun begins.

Definitely, I just bought a TREZOR. Waiting for it to arrive.
@_date: 2017-05-17 22:05:52
Recommend you to use Electrum on PC, Mycelium on Android.~
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:54:23
Yes. Guess it's a good idea to own some physical gold and silver and some cryptocurrency just to hedge against the next big crash of global economy. And really, from the housing bubble and almost everything bubble here in China, I'm really fearful for the future.  
On second thought. Once the crisis is over. I think people will think again about the old monetary system. And bitcoin will rise from the ashes.

If your hardware wallet is stolen. Your bitcoins aren't, as long as you still have the paper backup of the mnemonics.  
The TREZOR has a PIN protection. Each time you put in a wrong PIN, your next wait time will increase by a power of 2. Trying out 30 PINs will take you 17 years.

Ha, you're a really resourceful person! How's the price on these bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:01:30
Just big players looking for a good time to take profit. A negative news is always the best time.

I got one few months ago in China. Paid $20 custom fee. Why the custom fee so high for Trezor in India? What's the category they put Trezor in?   
  
The custom here didn't know what a Trezor is.  So the transport company asked me about it, and I told them it's a USB encryption device. The custom taxed me accordingly.

Just tested, sent a tx with 4.425 sat/byte. Confirmed within 10 minutes.

Maybe they are trying to compare the invention of bitcoin with the inventions from the renaissance.
@_date: 2017-07-10 06:23:00
Due to this problem. Unless quantum entanglement communication is achieved. 
  
A cryptocurrency won't exist on more than one planet. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:26:34
It does allow custom fee. Tap on the fee number when you're trying to send bit coin. It allows you to set the fee in sat/byte
@_date: 2017-07-04 14:44:11
I've transferred all my "pocket money" from Copay to my Samourai wallet, just because you have custom fee.   
  
Would be a lot lot better if you can support hardware wallets like Mycelium.  
  
If you do that. Samourai would be the only bitcoin wallet app I use on my phone.

He's humble, humorous, intelligent and logical. I'm better at explaining bitcoin to my friends now because of Andreas.
@_date: 2017-07-10 10:10:11
Yeah. Maybe, future humans will find a way. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 04:38:59
Don't know about bitcoin, but the next two to five years will be a exciting ride for global economy.
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:43:52
He simply [doesn't invest in stuff he doesn't understand]( That's a great advice for people to not get scammed. A smart person only invests in stuff he understands. 
  
BTW, Mr Buffet also didn't invest in Google or Amazon.

I don't have too much Bitcoin. But I understand it's one of the hedge I could have against fiat currency crash. Against government stealling my value.  I'll hold onto it, no matter what.   
  
Worst case scenario, it goes to zero. But if fiat currency crashes, 1 BTC will be worth millions of kilos of eggs.  
  
I see Bitcoin not as a investment, but as an insurance that I pay in case of fiat crushing.
Sorry for my English.

Seed = wallet 1  
seed+passphrase "fuckaroo" = wallet 2  
seed+passphrase "jihanshit" = wallet 3  
So on till the end of time.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:05:23
That's me, too. I know "Buy low, sell high". But after having less and less bitcoin, now I only HODL and buy the dips.

Just tell your mom her entry point. Install a ticker widget on her phone. Tell her as long as the price is higher than her entry point. She's fine.

It's less about the taxation. More about banks creating money out of thin air and stealing your value.

Mainly just Andreas Antonopoulos.   
  
Sometimes Jeff Berwick seems like a crazy uncle that means well. I still watch him tho.
