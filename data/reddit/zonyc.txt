This is from Banking on Bitcoin and it was released in 2016. I believe it's on netflix right now.

This analogy misses the point. Its not about buying the smartphone now for $500 vs a better one in the future for $500. Deflation means forgoing the phone now for $500, waiting for a while and then buying two of the better phones for $500. 
This is why economists tend to favor monetary policy which encourages inflation. If you could buy that smartphone now for $500, you probably would if you knew that next year $500 would only buy you 0.98% of the smartphone.

Awesome, I appreciate the reply! I guess that APY really isn't the best way to represent loan rates then unless of course you're selling a lending bot.

I know this reply is a few days late but thanks for this breakdown! Do you know if polo rates are actually compounded daily for the lender? For example 1 btc lent at 5% for day one = 1* 0.05. Does day two begin at 1.05 btc * 0.05? Or does polo simply give you the lending rate * principle for the entire loan?

775 grams of gold (24k) is 32k USD. 25,000g or 25kg of gold (24k) is 1M USD

You are paying the transaction fee to send BTC to bitpay already. In addition to this, they also want you to pay the transaction fees associated with bitpay sending that same BTC from their own address to another of their own addresses (i.e consolidating UTXOs).

He's the source that said BTCC, run by his brother Bobby, was shutting down, which it did.

If bitcoin is a fraud or bubble then why are the buying it on behalf of their clients? Not the best advising on their part lol

Just picked this up.  Overall I think its an excellent, well polished app.  The mining calculator is a nice addition.  The stats are verrrrry nice! Pretty graphs with tons of exchanges makes this my go to app for bitcoin related info.
Are there any plans to add alternative cryotpocurrenices i.e. SLC, i0, Ix into the mix?

It's back up to 46 on virtex! Sometimes being Canadian does pay off!
