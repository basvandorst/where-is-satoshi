I don't see any difference in using in-game payments, if you meant that. It's not very profitable to write a game that involves bitcoin. Probably, it's better to talk to current game developers to add support of bitcoin.

I think he meant that using bitcoin is like using internet in the 80s. It is not well-looking now. Some improvements have to be made. Only geeks and government used internet in the 80s.

Good article, but i don't think that this is a real problem for bitcoin right now to think about it.

“Giving students access to cryptocurrencies is analogous to providing them with internet access at the dawn of the internet era,” sophomore Jeremy Rubin said in a statement.
So whats the point to give bit coins to students if he thinks that literally cryptocurrencies are dying?

11.62 BTC is huge money! how did you lost it? congrats that you've returned it! what was exchange rate at that time to USD? 
@_date: 2014-04-28 11:24:48
Wow! My congrats! In what country do you live? It must be very up-to-date school!

In case of current bitcoin popularity it's a great idea to accept this currency. But I'm interested in price formation. Bitcoin always fluctuates, how does it impacts on sales? And as I understand you use kinda of converter bitcoin-&gt;USD, so there must be any kind of tax?

Does anyone know what is exchange rate and commission rate? is it a private one? or how i can connect with a supplier?

Evidently r/bitcoin changed a bit, with adding right column, actually, i think it was better without it! Also pics could be bigger!

So, you receive bitcoins, but the price we see is in USD, so the api checks the current exchange rate and converts the amount you have to pay in bitcoins, am i right?
I'm curious 'cause i think 'bout opening own store
Thank you so much for answering!

agree, and would like to add that accepting bitcoin can help you expand your business, with new customers, but you have to look for them on sites like this. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 06:56:02
In some way it may be useful to tell your clients about bitcoin and how they can earn it. If you are repairing computers you may add a feature to provide pc configuration for mining.

I'm not surprised, Canada is after USA. What USA wants, Canada does.

Kinda agree with post and what to add that they could actually add a auction feature.
Also, imagine a situation:
Someone (let it be Sarah) is selling the spot for,say, 5$
Another one (John) sees it and says, ok! I want it.
They agree to meet at 6 p.m., but John is getting late,because of jam!
Let's say, parking meter is time limited and Sarah time is over, so she just left the spot and when John arrives the place is already occupied.
The app is great! But in case of real life it can be not very useful.
Another idea is to go further and communicate with city officials to make parking spots to somehow recognize the person who payed for them, but I now,it sounds crazy.

"you can monitor how it is interacting with its peers" Sorry for question, but what I can learn from it? If I am a newbie, do i need it for more effective mining?
@_date: 2014-04-28 07:16:28
good idea! teaching people is the best way to popularize products in this case it's bitcoin!

professional services are good, but what if someone hacks them? to me it depends on size of money, the bigger the amount the higher the responsibility for them.

"campaign manager Lisa Kaufmann told the Campaign for Public Integrity that Polis has raised $1,500 worth of bitcoins from just 39 voters."
Very good start! Just 39 voters and 1500$..let's see what's going to be next..

couple of days ago read in some newspaper that crypto currencies never replace real ones as they are unstable, what can you say about that? i believe that as long as there are fluctuations only few entrepreneurs will accept bitcoin as payment
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:27:51
Wow-wow!! Wait a bit! That topic is 2 years old! Maybe the current exchange rate is a bit low now, but it may go down..so I just wait.
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:18:07
Ok, thank you! But.." attacks being performed by peer nodes" i thought that bitcoin is secured..Sorry for asking,may be, silly questions, but I really want to learn about it, and talking with someone who is a professional is the fastest way to do it..
@_date: 2014-04-28 07:01:19
ok, i had to add "as long as". also, i believe, there should be some guarantee for people that one day they don't lose all their BTC because of blalblabla from government.
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:55:20
add bitcointalk.org to your list, but what's your business? For example if you sell furniture you can make advertisement on bitcoin connected sites, just have a talk with admin. for bitcoin owners it's sometimes better to buy in bitcoins as there is no commission rate.

Because smart guys usually try a lot of new things and usually they are the first to taste all of the bugs on themselves.
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:20:20
Hey! Looks pretty good!! But wouldn't it be better to write on the face side about accepting bitcoin?
