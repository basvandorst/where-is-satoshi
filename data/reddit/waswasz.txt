Put them in many paper wallets so you dont get tripped up with forgotten passwords or technology changes in 5 years. ("heres my old trezer. How do use this again? Are they still around? Whats that code?) 
Put the amount in each wallet assuming that one day each will be worth 100,000 someday so you dont have to move them into smaller wallets when they actually are that. So maybe a future $1,000 per wallet?
Divide them up so you dont lose them all in one place. Not all together vso if someone finds your stash they find ALL your stash) and not all in one place (so they dont all burn down in one house)..
Then forget about them (but not where you put them).
Well done.
A good move for your future.  My guess is they will be a very substantial portion of your networth in 5 years.

Someone in a video made the point that they thought the ones behind the btc alTs like bcash etc were selling their real bitcoin  they received i guess as the initial buyins on the alts because they knew their own coins were going to hell and they wanted to lock in some real cash from it all
Made sense to me at the time that they would do this.  They cant very well sell their own alt coin but they see it going down and want to preserve some of their wealth so they sell their btc.  Plausible i guess.

People should use paper wallets.
More coins are lost from forgetting passwords or  misusing fancy wallet tech than any other way.

So spend that $10 a week on bitcoin instead.
Then when bitcoin hits $100,000 in 3 or 5 or next year you will have $10x 52x 20 = approx $14,000 instead of nothing.
Thats lifechanging savings money for most $10 lotto players.
When it goes to a million you will have $140,000 instead of nothing..
If it doesnt do much you still have $520.
There is a LOT more chance Bitcoin will go to $360,000 (themarket cap of gold) than anyone winning more than $1000 in any lotto.

Love that.


Now Bitcoin exists, with a potential upside 100x of Gold.
But also significantly more risk of catastrophic failure. 5000 years of monetary excellence is not something to be overlooked.
Golds inflation rate (which works to dilute your wealth) is equivalent to a yearly management fee of ~2%, which was cheap before 3rd of January 2009.
Then Bitcoin came along with a new definition of scarcity!
Bitcoin allows someone to aquire a slice of the pie which cannot be diluted.
Everyone must find the level of risk to reward that they are comfortable with.
I see a place in a portfolio for productive assets (shares) as well as money (gold/Bitcoin/fiat).
What percentage you hold in each will be based upon your net worth, risk tolerance, stage of life and a multitude of other factors.
@_date: 2018-11-30 06:23:02
A very strong argument.
Actuallythe same happens in most anything. Derivatives are written far beyond the goods or assets they supposedly represent.
Education about settlement risk is the key.
But the major players in the overall investment world like hedge funds arent interested in ccorn when they buy corn futures.

First of all lighting network has appeared and price has gone down therefore the transaction value proposition you describe has been realized.
But transactions like that is by no means bitocins only or most important intrinsic value.
More important areability to hold resources out of the grasp of increasingly political alternatives like paypal or banks who can shut you down without warning just for patreonizing things they dont like. Governments do the same. Chinas new social score is an example.
Furthermore the ability to store money/credit  without permission or storage fees is great. Banks charge fees for accounts. They have strigent terms. They often wont allow large cash withdrawals. Go to your bank and ask for $6000 in cash. Its your money right? See what happens.
Independence is bitcoins biggest intrinsic value.
When paypal or patreon seizes or shutsdown your acount because of something you said you will understand.
Bitcoin lets you store a portion of your wealth on a ledger that cant be shutdown.  Thatsextremely important and more and more so as we see private companies and governments get more and more intrusice.
Everyone should store a portion of their wealth in bitcoins software ledger.
Its a better alternative to burying gold in the backyard.

I say sell the lessor of 10% or half if by doing so it can double your net worth today.
And do it only if you arent going to put it in something like a house that can loseit all. Remember the 2008 housing crash 
Lock that in.
Dont sell more than 50% .
Pay your taxes on that gain immediately. This ikckudes federal AND STATE. states are more ruthless than the feds in collections.
Pay it early. Get that tax obligation out of your hands before you can spend it. Do not invest the portion that is the tax obligation no matter how sure thing you think it is.  Keepit away from the wife too.
Put it all in a index fund with a mix  of stocks and bonds.

Fiat like the US Dollar is inflationary. Period.
That means it loses value over time by its intrinsic nature.
Bitcoin is not inflationary. Its intrinsic nature is to retain and gain value agaisnt inflationary fiat over long periods of time (speculative media investment surges and wanes excluded)

Be very very careful when using modern wallets to sweep your coins from your old wallet. They work very differently thsn they did years ago . You can easily lose all your coins by sweeping them and misusing the new wallets and devices.   For example in the old days if you scanned a paper wallet with acommon android wallet it kept the bitcoin in the paper wallet address and you could send some and destroy the wallet on your phone and still have your remaining coin in the original paper wallet. No if you do that you lose all your bitcoin because the android wallet moves all yourbitcoin to a new address "for your safety" without asking you.!
My suggestion is print out ten paper wallets and sending one tenth of your holding to each.  That way while you restudy bitcoin and all the new tech your stuff is safe and when you try to do whatever you eventually do you cant lose it all at once.

@_date: 2018-11-25 19:48:55
Depends on how much you buy.
Lots of people spend $100 a month on lotto or las vegas.
I make a valid point. A $100 a few year ago in bitcoin would have made a tremendous difference in most peoples lives today it woukd be $5000 or $10,000 which is a great emergency fund and f u money for most people.
Bitcoin has a long way to go and the recent drop just gave everyone another 5x to look forward to in the future.
You dont HAVE to make make a 1,000,000  to have bitcoin change your life. Most people cant save anything. If they end up with an extra $10,000 or $50,000 in 10 years it will drastically better their lives.

If form follows the past after where ever it bottoms we are looking at a year of bouncy flat linear growth before another rise and another peak around 2021. That might be a good time to sell part or all of you are trying to catch the temporary peaks rather than just hold.
Frankly if I had seen this graph before from 2014 i would have sold half around 2017.  Now its too late to sell as your downside is probably zero or maybe 50% max and the likelyhood seems to be that over the next 2 years you might get a 30x or more if the 100,000 target is right. So you dont want to sell now and have misjudged the bottom and miss the first part of the next rise so you might as well hold now.

There are 3.8 billion ounces of mined gold in the world as of 2011 and 50 million more ounces are mined EVERY YEAR. 
There will only be 21,000,000 bitcoin EVER so less than half the amount of gold mined EVERY YEAR.  Gold is at about $1200 per ounce now. Bitcoin should be at a minimum over 100 times that based on gold rarity and and pricing.

There is no limit.

There are only 21,000,000 of them. The world has billions of people.

The ones who panic sold will be the same ones getting the most FOMO on the next rise and determined to buy in to make up their past losses.  People who buy emotionally are like that. It works up and down.

If you use the heat from bitcoin mining then it doesnt really cost that much because it offsets other heating costs.

This show bitcoin has a very steady adoption curve punctuated by publicity bubbles.  ts amazing how regular it all is.  It shows that bitcoin overall really has not seen a big picture retraction at all on the big parabola of adoption.
I think it also shows that the emergence of alts has not really changed the adoption curve big picture which is interesting. It seems the alts just have attracted additional investment rather than changing the curveof bitcoin.
