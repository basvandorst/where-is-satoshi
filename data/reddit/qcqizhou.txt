To determine S, I think there are a couple of ways:
\- S = M \* block\_reward, where M is a factor (e.g., 8 in my example).  This means that the PoSW could immediately bring about M times higher security than pure PoW for a recently-created block
\- W \* S \* yearly\_expected\_return =  yearly\_block\_reward, where for current data yearly\_expected\_return is about 655200 BTC, and thus yearly\_expected\_return is about  655200 / 3000 20000%.
We are experimenting with different values of yearly\_expected\_return, and we found that with 100-200% yearly\_expected\_return, people are likely to stake (please check mainnet.quarkchain.io/stats)

Actually, the idea makes the mining pool more costly, because the mining pool needs to stake besides running a node.
If you mine solo, you don't need 300 BTC.  300 BTC in the example is for a pool with 10% hashpower, but a solo miner, in general, will have much less hashpower.

That depends on how many BTC required.  In the example, the BTC required is up to 3000 BTC.  Actually, the BTC required depends on the hashpower % of the network, and assuming owning 10% of BTC hashpower, the miner (or pool) only needs 3000 \* 10%  = 300 BTC.  Note that 3000 BTC is less than 0.02% of current BTC circulation, where other PoS (dPoS) will require a much higher staking ratio (e.g. &gt;10% for EOS).
In addition, for centralization, I think we could refer to the cost of mining solely.  Consider a miner needs at least 1/1000 hashpower to mine solely (about 1 block per week), the cost is about (using Antminer T17 with 42Th) 85,000,000 / 42 (hashpower per device) / 1000 \* 1500 (price in USD from [ = 3M, which can be much higher than corresponding staking cost (about 100 \* 8000 = 0.8M for producing one block for every W=30 blocks).

Admittedly that combining PoW and PoS (or hybrid PoW/PoS) is not a new idea.  One famous example is Decred, where miners produce a block using PoW, and stakers check in the block using the hash of the block to select stakers.
However, I feel the security model of Decred is not quite clear to me, while the proposed PoW with staking could give a strictly mathematical way to illustrate the attacking cost (like PoW 51%) together with a slash condition.

yes, it is S \* (N + 1), where N is the number of blocks mined by the same miner in recent window W.  The point is that with slashing condition (and the tokens locked for a few days as general PoS required), the newly created block's security could be 8 times higher (in the example) besides capital invested in mining machines.
Further given W = 30, the required staked to perform the attack will be W \* S, which is 30 \* 8 \* 12.5 BTCs if the attacker would like to create an arbitrarily long attacking fork.

BTW: The paper describing the idea can be found here:

The key difference is to try to combine both benefits of PoW and PoS
PoW Pros and Cons:
\- (Pro): External resource (electricity) makes it harder to attack compared to PoS
\- (Con): Hashpower can be immediately moved from one chain to another chain, making 51% attack to be much easier
PoS Pros and Cons:
\- (Pro): Slash condition could bring extra security
\- (Pro): Harder to swap the tokens from one chain to another chain and perform an attack
\- (Con): No external resource makes the attack model much more complicated such as nothing-at-stake, stake grinding, fake stake ,etc
PoW with staking (we called it Proof of Staked Work):
\- (Pro): External resource as PoW and simple attack-cost model (no nothing-at-stake, staking grinding, etc)
\- (Pro): Stashing attacker tokens makes the attacking cost much higher
\- (Pro): Harder to swap the tokens from one chain to another chain and perform an attack

I am also a bit confused with S(5).  In my example, S is 100, and thus 3 \* S is about 300 (to create 3 blocks / 30 window, about 10% of hashpower).  The cost of the staking is 5 \* 300 \* 8000 = 1.2M, while the cost of such mining devices would be about 30M.

Oh, it should be S \\times 3 for 10% hash power (just update it).
And for cost analysis, I quote my previous comments as follows.
