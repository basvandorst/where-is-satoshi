Is there anyway to ask someone to confirm this or to confirm it with my own mining power?
@_date: 2014-02-22 16:39:00
YOU MADE IT A 3 for 1 with the parentheses.
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:10:25

@_date: 2014-06-23 05:59:27
How long do they usually take?
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:11:38
I swallowed a nickel once... that shit is gone.

  Check it out, here's the evidence.

GOD DAMMIT, IT WAS THE MARK NESS MONSTER... and after that... HE ER JERBS!!!
@_date: 2014-06-23 02:38:26
What do you mean? sorry I am confused.
@_date: 2014-06-23 02:21:30
Here is the transaction. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 03:37:34
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-23 02:39:33
What is replace by fee? Also, would you be able to direct me to where to contact Eligius or Slush?  I can't find a place on their websites to do so.
@_date: 2014-01-15 06:20:43
Whoever says don't spend it is some guy who just wants to speculate on BTC. Invest it in something to grow yourself.
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:33:41
Nah, everyone's just a circlejerk smark who hates smarks.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:12:30
btw I wish they were paying me... assholes.  Just to let you know I'm not shilling for them, I hope Josh chokes.
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:59:00
What is your business model moving forward?

@_date: 2014-01-10 08:57:00
Thanks! I will definitely contact her!
@_date: 2014-06-23 02:48:34
What exactly does that mean? The one output is non-standard part?  And I know that I should listen now, just didn't understand it really.  I'm still a noob user.
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:18:03
Boys soul.
@_date: 2014-06-23 03:13:14
I am sending it to a BitPay.  Do you know if three is enough to confirm?
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:26:39
It's listed on my website AdamBurl.com but you have to do a couple clicks to get to it.  Nonetheless, I don't really know how to track who sent it or why.
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:03:44
Haha, yup! It's my first one.  All, less than one cent of it!
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:10:34
This is a great idea for the future. Currently, I'd like to award the first scholarship to a US student so that I could fly or drive out and personally award them the scholarship. This could be documented by photo and video, and then we associate it with their story.
Although I would love to do something like Kiva does, I currently don't have the capital to do something international like that.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:13:33
Is this a for-profit or non-profit organization?
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:36:40
Absolutely interested. I will shoot you a message today.
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:20:28
It could be a cardboard box.  Does she live in one?

Donating 10% of sales to bitcoin charity
Not only I have officially started accepting bitcoin for my voiceover business AdamBurl.com, I have also decided to donate 10% of all sales to Sean's Outpost or another charity of the client's choosing.  Let any of your media friends know about this and have them listen to my demos!
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:50:25
The scholarship is still hypothetical, this was mostly just brainstorming at the moment.  I would definitely create clearly defined terms and talk to contributors in order to see what the criteria for applicants would be. Thanks for your interest and feedback! Are you still in school?
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:35:32
Thanks for the advice! That is a great process, I will save this!
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:40:37
I got my first buy in about 6 days because I ordered right before the weekend (and they typically do so in 4 business days).  However I got a few after that faster than that, and a few I got instantly once i reached higher levels of verification.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:54:18
Part of the reason for rewarding students for technology and entrepreneurship is to inspire them to continue in furthering the cause of Bitcoin and other similar technologies.  Perhaps we can expand later on, but the I would want to start this scholarship to foster a relationship with the recipient and help them grow in the world of technology and business.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:46:24
Still working out all the details right now, but I will try and reply to everyone interested in this thread when it is made available for application.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:58:39
Although I would like to make the scholarship partially needs based, students still need to buy food, housing, and other supplies to help support and further their educational and professional careers. I would think you would still be eligble depending on what the exact criteria for the scholarship are.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:47:23
I will let you know when this scholarship is made available.
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:04:17
Thank you!  I just made a post there!
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:24:34
Ah okay.  Does that mean just to Post the exact same post "title, words" etc. to that board?
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:00:47
Hey man! Let me know and shoot me an e-mail!
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:22:23
Thank you for the in-depth context. That definitely helped a lot.
Once I get the money to invest in more aesthetic aspects of the site I will.  As you said, my main priority was letting people know what I did, and getting them to my demos.
Maybe I can hire you one day to help me with that! I'll keep your site in my address book!
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:55:57
Sorry I'm a little new to Reddit.  What does xpost mean? Repost?
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:42:21
My site is designed to be really simple for potential people clients.  They want to know one thing right away, "What does this guy's voice sound like?" They have that immediately, and everything else is only one click away.
Is there anyway I can market it better or improve from a bitcoin perspective?
@_date: 2013-12-25 03:57:27
Wow thanks! That's really helpful!
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:37:16
Awesome! I will keep you in mind when I start a fund drive.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:44:57
I totally get this as someone who was going to be a graduate student.  Perhaps there might be room as my funding base grows to create a graduate scholarship as well.  My aim would aim to reach out to younger students and start a relationship with a promising young mind and keep contact with them throughout their college career and beyond.
@_date: 2013-12-25 03:51:06
Look into Coinbase.com and check out they're merchant services. They are really good with this exact thing.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:50:38
I think this is a good idea for States that are still in violation of federal law.  Upvote for you.
