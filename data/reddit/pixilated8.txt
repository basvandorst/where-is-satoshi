I understand that blockmaxweight=4000000 would define the weight limit for SegWit transactions.  Why wouldn't blockmaxsize=4000000 allow legacy txs to reach 4mb blocks?  seemed to be asking an honest question, and it seems like a reasonable conclusion to reach.  Is there something else in place that would prevent it?

Wasn't there a list of companies that were supporting SegWit?  It's not like there hasn't been plenty of time to get the features in place, as long as it was stalled prior to activation.
Found it:  
AirBitz, Altana, Armory, Bitcoin Knots, Blockchain.info, BTCC, Ciphrex/mSIGNA, Counterparty, Digitalbitbox, Electrum, GreenAddress, GreenBits, KeepKey, Ledger, Omni Core, and Trezor are all listed as wallets that area "Ready" for SegWit.

Obviously, it depends on the country.  In the US, anyone born after 1960 doesn't get their full benefits until age 67.  Duncan1949, being 67 years old, was most likely born in 1949 (and even more likely with it in their name).  According to the chart, they would have received full benefits at 66.

I use LinuxCoin, myself.  My first rig was an Ubuntu install, and then I had to install everything mining related, troubleshoot, etc.  It worked fine enough.
On my second rig, I decided to try LinuxCoin.  Everything was already included.  Much faster and easier to set up and get mining.  Still fully customizable.
Any Linux install will work well enough, but why reinvent the wheel?
