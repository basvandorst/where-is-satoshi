2.500 euros invested. I take a look 4 / 5 times a day, but i think thats because we all want that this thing goes up / "to the moon". Because in fact i just dont care if i loose it all or if i get reach. Of course that the last option sounds better than the first, but the thing is that im not worried about.

This kind of articles means zero!! No one knows the real value of a bitcoin... and in my opinion, 1 btc is arround $0. Why? Because i cannot use it... i cannot go to a restaurant, a shopping or whatevet and use it. So, the real value at this moment is around $0. However its nice when people are confident, so price can grow a little and maybe i will be able to catch some money... because i do also have some money invested and i didnt pay $0 for it! :)

Jesus! $40 in commissions even on a michellin starred restaurant? I would use my dollars or euros, because i know that those $40 comission will worth the same on the next day, but not with btc. Everybody complains about governments, banks etc, but they keep things stable and you know that 1euro that worths 0,80dollar today will worth more or less the same tomorrow, so why use btc? As mentioned, im not negative and i love these posts, cause keeps the price on the top, and im on the same boat as you are!! :)

Oh yes... youre right! As i live in portugal can you please just share with me some restaurants and stores in order to use some btc? :) for sure there are some, but i dont bellieve there will be too many (never searched about it to be honest). And what happens if Mcdonalds or any other big restaurant chain starts to use it and says that one simple meal will cost you 20btc??! Shit, thats expensive! Is it? For sure they will not do it, it wouldnt make any sense, however all the market would start reacting to that news and we will find that 1btc doesnt worth so much. I dont like to be negative and im not being, all i want to say is that not even the smartest guy in the planet can say how much it will worth tomorrow because there are not too many use cases... In resume, i bellieve in this and on these prices, but in a real long term.. we are too far from that, because my mom doesnt have any btc with her! :)

Haha! Thanks for the advise bro! My investment is for a real long term, cause i do bellieve there will be a big demand for btc in the future with so many new use cases coming. 16.8M btc for 6billion people on the planet is too short so price must go up... and the more people use it the more stable will be the price, so maybe one day we will be able to buy cars and houses with it. Once we reach that point we will reach the final implementation stage.
