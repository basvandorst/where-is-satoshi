He has bags though, confirmed by a good friend of his.

They’re probably just trying to hit their shorts and then re-up.

I think you’re giving the general population too much credit.

If you send it in bitcoin you will not get the money back and you probably don’t have the resources to track this person down. This could be a catfish account as well. Don’t do it.

Also facts.

Because people are greedy especially the rich.

He has bags, he’s a smart guy. If he’s vested in gold you better believe he’s hedged in BTC.

Haha hell no, nothing financial is taught in US Schools and it’s not a coincidence.

Last time we saw this formation...

I’m an analyst too, and I concur. But I don’t see it as a blast, more of a “whisk by,” eventually, maybe, probably.

It definitely went under the radar with the general public, but made for a good laugh in the community.

While I would love to agree, if it’s bad enough, a lot of US Holders may be forced to sell against their will to provide for their families.

Honestly thought that went really well compared to how I thought it was going to.

We could go up, but we could go down, or maybe sideways. Like and subscribe if you feel like you got anything out of the rich content provided here today.

People get let go from their jobs and then selling for a loss isn’t something you’re thinking about at that point when you’re just trying to keep a roof over your family’s heads. In a perfect world no one would sell, but a recession can get really nasty for lower middle class families. Especially with the way the housing market is right now. 2008 wasn’t fixed, they just slapped a bandaid on a bullet wound. This next downturn is going to be a lot worse as a direct result of that. Which sucks, because my parents are ready to retire in the next couple of years. I’m worried that they won’t be able to.
That probably made no sense, but I’m going back to sleep.

Arguing/playing devils advocate is essential if you want to be prepared. Or you can just live in candy land where it’s all sunshine and rainbows until you’re exposed. I agree, build. But critiques are 100% necessary.

Yeah, I think Vegeta needs to be retired.
