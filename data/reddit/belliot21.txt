It will be just like you bought it at 11,000. If it goes up you'll have more money. If it goes down you'll have less

That is so messed up. They are already making enough money off of you by investing your money.

Get your funds into a crypto currency. ETN, XLM, ECC, etc.

Dam that's really crazy. And crypto is more secure than Fiat apparently...
Not sure about that...

Hey if anybody can help I would really appreciate it. I sent bitcoin to cryptopia about 6 hours ago (current time 7:41 PM) and it is confirmed but not in my cryptopia balance. What could be the reason for this? No point in contacting CPIA because the ticket time is 27 days. Here is the link 
It is 0.02964825 BTC

Bottom line is...in this current market...do not sell all your altcoins, you will probably end up losing a lot of money, but at the same time stop buying so many altcoins: Buy some god damn bitcoin, ETH, and LTC, before this rocket takes off through the stratosphere. The altcoins are not all going to tank, as all these "experts" keep saying. Remember: a strong bitcoin means strong altcoins.

Thanks for replying man. I appreciate it. I also spoke to a very intelligent person about this. He said in quotes after I sent him an article "the first link about the new zealand banks pulling support for nzdt i don't think affects us too much.  the topics on reddit don't influence me much- i see fear / panic / blame- for example, ETN was having trouble everywhere, cryptopia or any exchange couldn't be blamed for that.  The tons and tons of people having issues with support tickets not getting answered after 3 days - they aren't paying attention to reality.  Cryptopia was an excellent exchange.  Because of their excellence they are now having tons of problems because their popularity boomed faster than they could scale up.  so the 90% of new people experiencing the issues their collective herd have impacted the website / server / customer service with are forced to form negative opinions.  Its like a million cats being pushed into a shoebox, they are all going to get scratched and angry lol" 
yea they need a MUCH bigger team
I mean if they need help. Why don't they hire help
they are hiring, but you see, the crypto-space is a trustless system.  its too easy to invite someone with decent reputation only to  have that person reveal their true nature later on by robbing everyone.  hiring is slow, because trust must be established.  They have some of the best talent in the world, but finding reliable people who won't cheat, hack or steal is a problem.  many programmers see themselves as Gods above the law, I'm finally watching Mr. Robot so i'm really understanding the gravity of security flaws.  People simply can't be trusted like they used to back when the protestant work-ethic was more important than the get rich quick at everyone else's expense culture...
