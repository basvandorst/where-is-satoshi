They allowed mining and trading for personal (or corporate) profit, but not exchanges.  I don't understand why the USA is trying to prevent exchanges from being set up domestically.  Having to trade and hold accounts internationally seems like a great way to get around repatriating your funds and enjoying a nice tax break.  I understand that BTC is a threat, but they can't beat us, so join us.  At the very least they should be able to see the potential windfall in tax revenue.

Any number of explanations.  First and foremost, they reported earning based upon an inflated tax credit.  Second, they posted unenthusiastic forward guidance.  Third, they began accepting Bitcoin and TPTB want to slam them for it.  The Bitcoin acceptance will only allow for further revenue in the future thereby mitigating their dire forward guidance (although they cannot say that as it would only further aggravate TPTB) so this correction should be retraced and exceeded in relatively short order.  I look at it as a buying opportunity.  
Just my opinion.

Therein lies the paper vs physical issue.  Never fear however, as we will shortly be seeing paper BTC trading with a market cap many times greater than the notional value of all 'physical' BTC in existence.  This is how people will develop the first derivatives.  As it stands, it is practically impossible to trade derivatives in a physically settled fashion so we will see something akin to GLD vs Gold.  The Winkelvii saw this early and - while I am not necessarily their biggest fans - worked to move the market in the right direction.
When major institutions can hedge their exposure, adoption should increase.

Agreed.  The most viable and profitable way for a bank to get involved would be from the insurance and currency exchange aspects.
After that, I'm sure they would figure out someway to rehypothecate the insurance risk a few times and create some sort of commodity/currency basket to trade.  Maybe at that point, the whole debt basket can blow up again and it will be impossible to bail out the banks on BTC debts without making every BTC holder rich.
One can hope...

There's a saying in trading: Anyone who says they know why the market went up or down or sideways today, is a liar.
Given that, I'm not so sure that the auctioned blocks will go below spot price.  It could very well be insider selling in order to scoop up cheaper coin from the Feds.  But I would imagine that the Fed coins will auction at a premium to spot as you are able to take down large blocks in an OTC fashion with near zero counter-party risk.

It has appeared pretty clear from the beginning that the trans mal issues resulted in MtGox creating a synthetic fiat currency tied to bitcoin.  After that, MtGox experienced a fractional-reserve bank run.
As always, I try never to attribute to malice what could be explained by incompetence - and I think this falls perfectly in to this category.
MtGox overlooked the trans mal issues they had (many arguments revolving around this. I am simply stating facts). 
When this issue began being exploited (due to lack of basic due diligence on MtGox's part) - supply and demand became unbalanced as MtGox was artificially inflating supply via trans mal exploits and redemption. 
Word reached the market and MtGox price crashed.  
With a 'bailout' of sorts, MtGox could absolutely be back up and running in relatively short order.  The reason they can continue with fiat withdrawals is because their trading volume is still high and they still collect fees - thereby giving the appearance of solvency.  
Without looking at their books (if they even have any), I cannot say one way or the other.  But if I were Karpeles and on the hook for thousands of BTC in back withdrawals while also having access to some liquid capital, I too might talk down BTC such that I could purchase some cheaply and make good on the previous trades.  I might even co-mingle some customer accounts to get that done.
Once your exchange is defunct and you are staring potential criminal charges in the face - why not go all out?  What's the worst that can happen?
For a real world case study of this see: MF Global

Always a Catch-22 when talking to journalists.  They - especially those at established organizations - have an agenda before their research is done.  The era of the investigative journalist is dead.  They have been replaced by propagandists.  Perhaps those most prominent in the bitcoin community should begin by giving interviews to organizations like Coindesk and reference those articles when mainstream reporters call.
Who knows?

The more I think about it, this could be interesting.  It is a great hedge for holders of large amounts of coin.  More importantly, it is using BTC as a store of value such that you can fund your account while skirting transfer fees, etc.  Essentially, if you fund using coin, it is giving you a synthetic 3% profit (when compared to cash) right off the bat.
Interesting model and I think it bodes well for BTC acceptance overall.
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:06:09
I fear that this will turn out to look a lot more like MF Global than it sounds now.  Perhaps Gox was operating as a market maker on its own exchange and, in classic Ponzi fashion come collection time no one was made whole. 
We'll see.

The only questionable aspect is the total loss of 744,408 BTC. The trans mal issues have necessarily resulted in a paper vs physical spread leading to the fractional reserve style bank run we saw. MFGox.

If that is indeed their intention, then I am all for it.  I would much rather trade on a domestic exchange subject to regulation and recourse in the event of illegality than wire money to some shady outfit in Bulgaria.  However, the gov't has not explicitly allowed exchanges to be set up.  Furthermore, the onerous MSB regulations for exchanges are above and beyond normal KYC and AML needed to open an account.  The novelty of this space should prove for some interesting drama in the regulatory landscape going forward. 
At this point I feel that this risk is borne not by BTC participants, but rather by the gov't itself.  Sure, they can force us in to things at the barrel of a gun (as they do everything else), but they cannot put the cat back in the bag.  If the US gov't decides to come down hard on BTC, they will only create a viable and unregulatable black market in a US$ alternative - something that hasn't happened here in over a century.  When the BTC black market proves more efficient, it will grow in to a large shadow economy and undermine confidence in the US$ itself.  
Given that one cannot truly regulate the internet, it would seem only logical that the gov't would try to bring BTC in to the fold rather than shut it out lest they shoot themselves in the foot re: reserve status of the US$.
Only time will tell, but I am inclined to believe that cryptos are here to stay regardless of gov't interference.

Don't forget to properly account for any potential cap gains you may glean from that 3 mBTC gift...
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:15:25
True.  I must have read over that.  However, I do think that the BTC community rallying around Gox by claiming that it was not operating in a fractional reserve fashion is short-sighted.  I've seen this before in real markets, not cryptos.  It is the same every time.  It only makes sense that Gox was taking the other side of customer trades by comingling account balances in hopes that when it came time to pay the piper, the mkt value would be exponentially higher.  Obviously Karpeles thinks highly enough of himself to attempt to pull something like this off.

Back-testing to Dec 2012?  At least this is looking better than the Fortress 0.5x fund.  Without dedicated market makers, it will be interesting to see how all of these "funds" and "institutional paper" (read: Coinbase, BitPay, etc) are able to get in and out of positions without soaking up all of the available liquidity.
It's great to see so many coming in to the space, but the fact of the matter is that there isn't yet enough room.  Soon, though.

In business you can fire people or cultivate new, more efficient, partnerships.  The monopolistic nature of government prevents this.  
I have to ask why it is that the government does not require a profit?  What does the government have that individuals and corporations do not?  
I would contend that it is a monopoly on force.  If that is the case, then every single action taken by the government is a result of force.  In my business dealings, I prefer to cooperate for mutual benefit.  The government does not.

I am a HUGE fan of this.  However, when we begin proposing this domestically, we will be giving some real energy to the established political opposition.  Politicians aren't terribly scared of the currency (property) aspects of BTC, but when we introduce blockchain voting (read: non-hackable), we are going to anger a whole lot of people.

Hedge Fund might not be the right term here.  These guys seem more like Introducing Brokers (IB) and Investment Advisors.  This means that you deposit money (BTC) with them and they do the legwork trying to craft an investment strategy that suits your risk tolerance.  The question is whether they use a floating exchange rate or lock in a dollar value upon deposit.  If it is the latter, then they are going to be trading the coin on the side while collecting management fees on your deposit.  Better to sell the coin for cash and invest that way unless you are feeling generous towards the hedgies.

The arbitrary and capricious nature of financial regulations currently serves as a barrier to entry for all aspiring financial professionals.  For instance, in order to have the right to sit for your Series 7 test - a license subjecting you to SEC regs AND necessary to sell securities - you must first be sponsored by a financial services company.  These days, financial companies (broker/dealers, etc) are loathe to hire an inexperienced representative therefore it is increasingly hard for new blood to enter the financial industry. And on and on it goes in an downward spiral.  
Assuming you meet all licensing requirements, the ongoing nature of regulation is such that nearly everyone is out of compliance for one thing or another at all times.  This leads to an "old-boys club" where those well connected are overlooked (see: HSBC money laundering fines).
While I do feel that some KYC/AML requirements are probably necessary for widespread adoption.  The imposition of the full suite of regulations will stifle innovation and play directly in to the hands of established financial powers. 
Fortunately centralized regulation is not compatible with the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.  So we, as users, have to opportunity to choose which regulations are just and which are not through selective compliance...  As dicey a proposition as that may sound...

Agreed.  Why would anyone use a slow, fee-based mobile payments system when the same process can be executed for free in an unfiltered manner?  I can't blame them for wanting to push their own product - especially considering Apple has been pursuing brick-and-mortar payments via the iTunes accounts already on file for quite a while now.  Perhaps they should be dynamic and provide for a seamless BTC based mobile payments system with PayPal and Coinbase that takes revenue in micro-payments? 
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:25:02
Interesting.  I suppose it is possible if they are to pay-in-kind (ie: convert coin to cash and pay 3% on the cash IN cash or issue a 3% debt obligation denominated and payable in coin only).  At this point, you are simply operating as a BTC bank and offering 3% savings accounts (or CDs depending on the contract). This raises a lot of issues regarding fractional reserve banking and inflation, but it is theoretically possible. 
It will be interesting to watch this going forward, but I am not holding my breathe for success here.  Too many balls up in the air and question marks to keep the game going for very long.

Valid points that can be vigorously debated.  What most fail to recognize is that governments, by their very nature, produce nothing.  The government will take from productive citizens and necessarily deploys their newly acquired capital in a less efficient manner.  When you have a bloated bureaucracy where every layer requires their 'cut,' there is a less efficient allocation of capital.

A lot of missed opportunities in that interview:

"Cost, speed, elimination of need for a third-party intermediary."  
Done.  
That is the end of that conversation.  Why not fold in the notion that the ability to transfer funds is, in and of itself, a privileged position which can now be extended globally?

Because politicians do not yet accept BTC donations.  When that happens, we could crowd-source our own politicians (if the intention is to play withing the existing rules). At the same time, why should a politician pay attention to a paltry $12bln mkt cap internet-based movement (that they probably do not believe in to begin with) when they can drop to their knees for an industry with trillions of dollars in mkt cap and not have to stretch their brains to try to understand it? 
Education is the key here.  The vast majority of individuals have no idea re: money creation and banking.  Luckily, BTC gets people asking questions.  Remember Henry Ford's prescient quote:
"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."

Markets like certainty.  It is better in the long run to get direction from major governments than to be left in the dark.  The more guidance issued, the larger the liquidity pool and the lower the volatility.  If we can rein in vol over the next couple of years, people might start taking BTC more seriously as a currency rather than a technology.  As Goldman Sachs used to say: 
Be long term greedy.
