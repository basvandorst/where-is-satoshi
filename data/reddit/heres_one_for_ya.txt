RemindMe! 1 year "I sure hope you're right about this..."

Hey, let's focus on the negative and list the reasons why it won't work rather than see the positive side of things - someone else is learning about Bitcoin!

...to where?? To some kind of planetary orbiting body??

I've received a few of these myself. Most of them warning me to log in or lose all my BTC (which is ludicrous because all my BTC is in a paper wallet in my safe)
I've been sent to "Blogchain.info" so many times....

Well yeah - I think he was just interested in that as a way of earning them instead of paying for them. If anything it's a way to get him into the world of BTC

The first one I ever saw was "blogchange.info"
They appear to be getting smarter.

That seems more like it's going to give us a bad name as people who go around putting stickers in places they shouldn't be. Like skaters do to road signs. It won't get anyone taking, just give BTC a rep for being annoying.

I forgot about that! I used to do that too. It felt absolutely rudimentary and ass-backwards. I might as well have been typewriting a letter to my grandmother asking her to buy me BTC at the general store.

Do.... do you take Bitcoin???
@_date: 2015-02-09 11:37:51
Hey don't feel too bad. Think of the guy who's only a .2

So... What's the point of all of this? People are buying and trading and selling this new Internet currency en masse, an entire economy and trade market has been created, all for a system of payment that is barely used? Or is there something I'm missing?

So hypothetically if I purchased 2 BTC last week at 47, and the price goes up to 60 or 80, I have "made money"? And if the price goes down I have "lost money"?
Does the market price affect the value of certain places that charge BTC? For example if something was 1 BTC when it was at 50, would/should that same item go town to .5 BTC if the value jumps to 100?

Yes I would also like to know this

Wow... You're not kidding haha
