That episode has some of the funniest commentary I've ever heard.

Potentially millions of dollars in cancer care is generally understood to not be affordable by your average person.

Hopefully nobody.  But that doesn't mean that insurance companies won't have to if you can afford all of their bells and whistles.  Even then, there's plenty of expensive copays and medication costs that can run thousands a month by themselves.  Then maybe your insurance doesn't want to pay for something, so you have to get on the phone or write letters and fight them to pay for shit they said they would.  Every system has its problems, but the whole idea of a risk-based insurance market for healthcare is fucking stupid.

It's not like it's any sort of mystery that it's paid for with taxes.  It's still cheaper for him on a personal level.  The price of treating cancer in the US is astronomical, even if you're lucky enough to have cancer coverage on your plan.

I don't advocate for elimination of the healthcare market, rather I advocate for the elimination of much of the health *insurance* market as it exists now and a rethink of EMTALA and how it's paid for.  Competition amongst the providers of healthcare is what helped us get the best.  I'm not anti-free market, I just think the way health insurance companies work in this country is parasitic.

That's because our cancer care is fucking awesome.

Less volatile?  What?
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:59:37
Soooo really just as volatile.

I'm of similar thoughts.  I'm not putting all my savings in it, but why not throw a few bucks at something risky and see where it goes?  The world has never seen anything like this and I'm happy to be a part of it.
