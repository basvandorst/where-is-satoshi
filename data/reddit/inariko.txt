Well, technically, with the lottery being so high, it's considered a good time to buy tickets.
*However, it's still taking a gamble.* There's chances the lottery won't work out, and there's chances bitcoin won't work out unless you're in it for the long run.

Then why did you even bring up the suicide hotline?
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:15:58
That twitter is a joke account where a very fake undercover cop poses as a kid and asks people to do very illegal things in hopes to catch them.
Making the joke here because you're asking for help with something very illegal and when should be obvious that this isn't the right venue for this sort of thing. It's easily traced, and leaves evidence of your wrong-doing.
Not that I'm here to judge; just be careful, bro.

I chuckled. You should totally post that flyer.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:45:53
If $10k is hardly a substantial amount to you, then technically, you CAN afford to lose it so the rule doesn't exactly apply. If your friend really doesn't care about how it goes up or down, the suicide watch is not directed at him.
I'm not saying don't take risks, I'm saying don't take risks with money you can't afford to lose. Some people post stories about taking out LOANS to invest in bitcoin only for it to crash the next day. That kind of stuff is ridiculous.
But you and I seem to be in agreement; no matter what, even if someone made a huge mistake like that, any suicidal thoughts should be taken very seriously. No one deserves to kill themselves because they made a bad investment.

A millionaire probably won't care about most of the stuff the average bitcoin cares about: lower fees, not having to deal with corrupt banks.
What they would care about is freedom from government regulation. It'd essentially be a way to worry about fewer taxes since you can't tax bitcoin.

It would be neat if there could be circlejerk flagging system, letting the mods ultimately decide if something is close to  circlejerk status.
If you're worried about something, you could flag it. The mods come in, review it, and then act accordingly. It gets a label so people can move on.
Of course, that's a lot of work for the mods...
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:07:45
You're assuming bitcoin's gonna plummet to those prices, though. There's a chance it'll stop and rise back up, and the people who sold out at $600 and took a loss won't even be able to buy back in.
It's best to just ride the wave and let it happen without running around screaming how this is the end

I guess mocking it as "libertarian play-pretend money" two years ago when I had a chance to start mining with some friends counts as a fail.

This is the sort of thing that scares me about people adopting bitcoin. It's going to increasingly become more difficult if it's not just given to you in lieu of cash payment or gifts to buy it.

They're pretty much banning any price listing posts now, but you could argue that it's because it gets pretty repetitive fast, doesn't add much to the reddit (as you can easily mention it in a comment) and it becomes invalid fast since the price is always changing.
Aside from price listings though, is there anything you really noticed getting removed?

Not to shit all over what you're doing, but unless they see a way they can profit off of it, they're not going to adopt it. They're no longer a team of visionaries, just a profit machine.

Tax avoidance isn't the same thing as evasion. It's not the most moral thing if you believe in the IRS or the US dollar (I personally have faith in both bitcoin and the US dollar so I'm not advocating it), but it's technically not illegal.
That being said, this DOES make it a draw for multimillionaires looking for a way to dodge taxes. Not necessarily the greatest argument for the average person, but this is meant to appeal to those who already benefit from the system and are probably more driven by self-preservation than banding together to help a new currency. That's just the assumption I'm making going into this.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:47:29

If you're doing things with the INTENT to dodge taxes and nothing else, sure
I'm sorry, I thought you were talking about the actual act of just putting all your money into bitcoins itself was unlawful. I was arguing that the act of happening to avoid taxes because you're trading in bitcoin isn't exactly illegal.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:30:46

Hey man, I actually agree that a lot more people should be a little more selfless-- it's just that, typically people who have made it so far in life that they're multimillionaires tend to not be as selfless. They're part of the system that we fight to change, as we've said before. Some people are just selfish and you actually have to give them a reason to join the good fight if you want to win in the long run.
The bottom line is if everyone was motivated by selflessness and the bigger picture rather than their own miserable lives, most of those things wouldn't need saving in the first place.

It's not ridiculous to post it to help people, but it's absolutely ridiculous people would take that sort of risk.
The number one rule is to not bet what you can't afford to lose. If you're gonna go suicidal over that loss, you shouldn't have bet it in the first place.
But when all is said and done, if you know anyone who is at risk for suicide, regardless of their own blame in the situation, it's okay to get them help.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:00:31

I'd like to argue that the same thing applies to things like gold, but gold also has a use aside from being a form of currency and symbol of wealth. The USD is backed by the US government. There is either some physical or large-scale system that gives these things value over a greater period of time, something that bitcoin lacks.
However, I think bitcoin, given enough widespread use, could have the same value placed in it. Just gotta wait to see if people are patient enough for it.

The reason why your answer wasn't good is because there actually are reasons why a millionaire should personally care about bitcoin. Plus you didn't do very much to argue why it's better for the world.
Chances are someone who is rich and benefited from the system isn't going to see much reason to change the status quo; typically they're the least likely to want to shake it up or admit that it might be flawed for those of lesser classes. Self-preservation is a human's biggest motivator and you didn't really attempt to appeal to that argument.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:43:16
If we're paying you, how is this any different than a bank? Actually, I'm assuming we don't gain much interest aside from the fact that bitcoins will increase in value in the future... so how are you any -better- than a bank?

They did what they thought was their best judgment, you did what you thought to be the best-- and assuming they didn't immediately sell it before it crashed, it turned out you were right and they weren't.
It's not you fault, really, it's theirs-- unless you're intentionally leading someone astray and manipulating their trust in you. Otherwise, no, you don't need to feel guilty. You can feel sorry for the people who lost money, sure, but it's not your fault they lucked out.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:55:50
Then it really makes me wonder what the reasoning behind blocking bitcoin is.

Indeed. We're on to you, OP.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:20:12
Volatility, because in a way, it can amplify all those other problems.
Volatility leads to more people losing money. That drives away support; lack of support/apathy makes government crackdowns more likely, which forces people to use less legitimate means to access bitcoins, thus opening them up to scams if they aren't as knowledgeable.
People get scared by the thought that the market can swing wildly and that that's considered standard-- take a look at the state of this reddit for the past two weeks. China's news might have caused the crash, but bitcoin going up and down is ultimately the reason why people panicked.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:53:51
Yeah, I do. And to be honest I don't blame you for assuming most bitcoin users here are male-- I really haven't seen very many people on this subreddit suggest they were female. Even I assume most people are guys until they say something.
But yeah, back to the point. Thank you for the little reminder that people should probably tear themselves away from watching prices fluctuate. What's the point of having bitcoins if you can't enjoy what you're going to spend them on?
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:28:35
I feel like this is just how the nature of economics work; everything has a value, but how do you determine said value? People do the same thing with government backed currency and gold (although if that's a good thing is up for debate) so it seems to be something that can and does happen already.
I'm not sure I'm making sense here, but I feel like if we do it with the USD and other currencies, why not Bitcoin?

Unless people start accepting payments in bitcoin, I think this is part of the nature of getting into it. You're going to have to invest money into it to start using it for your currency, and because of that, people want to hold on paying for things until it increases.
It sort of turns people newcomers into day-traders, made worse by the fact that everyone chimes in to buy and hold and wait for prices to pull a Neil Armstrong.

There are some people who deserve to be noted for their selfish scare tactics or other manipulative ploys.
Darkwing just also happens to be one of them. Look at his submission history-- the past 24 hours have been nothing but him screaming about his predictions for the future. Call him out on it and you get on his shill list.

I feel like it's too late for the US to clamp down-- if they did it years ago when not many people believed it and even fewer retailers accepted it, it would go quietly away.
Not to say that bitcoiners would suddenly start rioting, but they would definitely feel some negative impact. There isn't much constitutional ground to block bitcoin-- if it starts getting treated like a currency, that'd be great, but if it starts getting treated like a commodity there's even less of a constitutional footing for banning.
Banning it might actually do the opposite of what they intend-- it would create another story about the government overreaching its boundaries and would probably drive up support just for a reason to criticize Washington. This would make an even bigger scandal, and how much of that bullet are they willing to bite to keep bank lobbyists happy?
I think the ship has sailed for governments like the US to crackdown like China. China is pretty notorious for trying to protect their yuan so who didn't exactly see it coming?

Okay, it's no longer a *profitable* option for newbies unless you're able to sink a fair amount of money as an investment.
And yeah, the topic is about buying bitcoins-- I was expanding further saying that this is one of the ways it's harder for new folks to get into bitcoins unless they're willing to drop hundreds of dollars.

Yeah, but I think it's human nature to look at all those .0000's  and feel like your bitcoin wealth's insignificant. I personally am only worth .0004 (my friends/boyfriend jumped in two years ago, I laughed and blew it off til recently), so it's a LONG way up for me until I can spare the change-- dropping $20 or so to see it slowly tick up doesn't seem that worth it.
hence my begrudging frustration that mining is no longer a viable option *grumbles*

If the people tipping them can't handle the personal responsibility of checking those they tip, or hell, even care if it's true or not, they really don't deserve those bitcoin bits in the first place, really.
I thought this was the basic of the basic rules for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-09 13:03:43
In theory I suppose it'd work. I'd always recommend checking your country's stance on bitcoin, maybe look up cases where people were arrested for gambling, and determine if it's worth it.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:15:44
You can have a large number of people with losses (say 1k people lost 1k each) spread out over a few people with wins (100 people gaining 10k each). Considering the influx of people who are new and lost money in the crash, this is a likely scenario.
If you have a larger number of losers than winners, and people blame bitcoin itself for their winnings/losses, you're going to have more resistance to bitcoin than support for it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:39:04
If you don't know their story, it isn't worth beating yourself up for it. You could pretty much do that about anything. Essentially, the nature of limited resources will always mean someone comes up short.
For example, a loaf of bread is on sale. You don't exactly need another one, but it won't go bad by the time you do, and it's a REALLY good sale. So you buy one. Over the course of the week, it goes out of stock. IN that same week, a family who could only have afforded the bread on sale misses out. Maybe they could have had the bread if people didn't buy things just because it was on sale, but is that a totally reasonable way to go about life? You have to do what's best for you, sometimes, because you absolutely have no way of knowing how your actions will ripple outwards and affect random people you've never met.
You can either drive yourself crazy with every action, or do what you think is best, and have faith in it.

I feel like chinese investors who actually believe in Bitcoin as a currency will find a way. Hell, people always do.
You also can't say people will make a ton of money without know if it's true or not simply to drive fiat back into bitcoins. That's extremely immoral and selfish-- and has a chance to backfire. Because if they DON'T make money, what do you think they're going to blame? It'll drive people away, not convert them.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:02:25
This is where that breakdown in the conversation I was talking about is happening
I admit I was incorrect about it being illegal (I don't own even an entire bitcoin so I had no idea people were able to claim it as an asset yet), but I never said it was awesome and is a reason why bitcoin is *good,* I'm saying that's why some people care about bitcoin. I'm taking a neutral stance explaining why some people with loads of money looking to avoid taxes seem to care.
I never advocated it. I never said "this is the best and everyone should do it NOW," I simply said. This is a draw to bitcoin. Not a very moral one-- as i said before, but it doesn't change the fact that that's why some people got into it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:02:31
I really find it funny how anti-bank people are, but in reality they just didn't do enough research into local ones to find a really great bank.
The only fees my bank does is overdraft fees for checking and below minimum required balance for savings, which I think is pretty fair. I don't really use checks and if I want cash I suck it up and go to the bank instead of going to the ATM. It's not an *ideal* situation but it's way better than dealing with the shit BofA tries to pull.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:53:19
I actually picture you as one of those street corner pastors who scream about the devil and criticize women for wearing pants.
That is how little credibility you have.

Don't invest what you can't afford to lose. Most of the time I'd suggest trading in cash-- but because you're so young, this is probably not a good idea. There will be people willing to take advantage of you because you have less experience in lots of things compared to someone in their 20s-30s trading for a living.
Also, don't rely on direct bank transfers as these can always be reversed and you could get seriously screwed over.
I know this doesn't give you many options but in all honesty connecting a bank account is safest in my opinion.

For just a general collection of links, I'm not sure if Reddit would be best for that. It'd make it a little awkward if you were trying to look for a specific one.

... what? Dumping all your money into bitcoins isn't fraud-- it's essentially treated like a commodity that you can barter with like a currency. It'd be like putting all your money into a large quantity of a type of item because you wouldn't rather have it sitting around like cash.
And because you can create a virtual wallet, a software wallet, or paper wallet and not have to put your personal information like your name or social security number, there's essentially no proof that it's yours other than the fact that you are in possession of the wallet.
If you choose not to buy through a trading site or use your bank account to sell, you can pretty much buy bitcoins with cash and see little to no taxes on it.
Assuming you're not trying to intentionally launder ill-gotten funds, what laws are actually being broken here?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:51:42
Only you can decide that for yourself. None of us know the future.
Basic logic would argue that once it hits the lowest point it's gonna go, that's the best time to invest, but no one really knows when it's gonna stop dropping, when it's going to start ticking up-- hell, it could crash again tomorrow! Or it could soar higher than we thought. There's really no way to know, so don't expect us to have the answers here.

Unless someone bought in at below 600, selling at 600 would incur a loss.
Meaning if someone bought in at $800, selling at $600 would be a loss of $200.

Again, there's really no way to tell for sure. Some really positive news could come out and it could jump up. Or dire news could make it crash before where we were when a supposed bubble started.

If they're developing their own wallet, they're not going to want any competition unless they can find a way to make more money off a bitcoin app than they would their own.
I'm not saying it's the right thing or that it doesn't suck, it's just how the suits are gonna see it. They're not individuals who feel the squeeze of banks-- they're part of the system we're trying to fight with lots of friends on Wall Street who want to see Bitcoin fail.
