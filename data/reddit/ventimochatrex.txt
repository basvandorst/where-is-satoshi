 I just moved some Ltc from Coinbase to quadrigacx and it let me sell. You can also cash out after verification

Why not? If you put in x amount that becomes equivalent to $5000 after x amount of time does it suddenly become worth it?

Haven't checked in a few weeks but I bought at 3100. Pretty happy to be able to add a small amount to what I have

So there's a miner fee in both directions? When I checked yesterday, Coinbase was charging a flat fee (that's a high percentage considering my low balance) to transfer it all out

Don't stare directly into the sun bud

What does it do? I see that you login to Coinbase through them but I'm not entirely sure what it does

Thanks! It was a few bucks when I checked yesterday so I'll wait. I meant "flat" as in the fee remained the same no matter how much I tried to send to the wallet. 
So from my understanding, all I have to do is send money to the public key tied to my electrum or paper wallet as if I were buying something? I bought something with bitcoin a few weeks ago and it was pretty simple. 
It's a small amount so I guess I'll leave it on CB for now. I've gambled more than this amount at the casino so i may as well leave it there and see how things go in august haha
