Bitcoin is divisible down to 8 digits. Any amount can be stored in a wallet (public/private key pair). No coin has a key assigned to it. You can possess a key to an empty wallet, 0btc.

If the asset you bought for $7,500 depreciates to the point were it will only buy you a cheese burrito, you've lost a substantial amount of value.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:50:24
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:45:12
If 1btc crashed to $5, you don't see how you've lost anything of value? Wow
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:48:40
I can guarantee that brings 0 solace lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:35:49
Wrong. But I'm not going to take the time to explain why.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:15:39
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:53:10
Great, same amount of BTC. What's it matter if it can only buy you a hotdog? You're perpetuating a myth that you only lose when selling. If your asset goes to complete shit, you've lost.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:28:20
There's your problem, assuming BTC will only go up and cannot fail. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:10:00
It's an extreme example used to highlight the point. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:09:30
No, it isn't. A knife is a tool that can be used as a weapon. When I chop an onion or cut a steak, I'm using a tool, not a weapon. By your logic anything can be a weapon. How about a pencil? I could stab someone. How about a paperclip? I could poke someone in the eye? How about a can of Campbell's soup? I could bash someone in the head.
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:27:21
There is a fucking difference between a pocket knife and a rocket propelled grenade. Get your head out of your ass.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:38:04
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:19:03
Yes!! This is crazy :)
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:39:54
What does that have to do with your comment? You replied to the guy that said "That's gonna be a pain trying to find a wallet for 10 different coins"
@_date: 2017-06-05 04:41:06
I was just making a joke about how unlucky you've been to lose money and that instead of losing it, you should send it to me, that's all. I was not being serious 
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:28:57
Ethereum covers quite a bit
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:41:51
Are you asking us to tell you what the future holds for bitcoin? It can either skyrocket in value or go to 0. Those are really the only options. Buy based on what you feel will happen.
@_date: 2017-06-05 04:32:03
Wow man, that's rough. Instead of burning all that money, just send me $5k. I'll put it to good use. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:06:19


Lol amazing. Surely you aren't that blindly devoted to bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:19:37
You're off by 100 years, 2140.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:20:19
Ok, but that's 127 years from now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:43:24
Ok, you must not be eligible for instant purchases yet. Once all of your verifications clear, instant purchases will be available and you'll see your BTC immediately after placing an order.
With the 'pending' status, you should still receive your BTC at the price you purchased it at 8 hours ago.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:07:48
And he received an answer. But by looking at his total upvotes/downvotes, I knew the answer to his question without having to even read replies. That's just how reddit works.
A bunch of upvotes, few downvotes = Yes
An equal mix of upvotes/downvotes = No
A bunch of downvotes, few upvotes = Why the fuck did you even ask this? Doesn't deserve a response. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:55:54
quit with these posts, damn
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:15:54
You're dumb. Seriously. You're god damned dumb.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:53:49
Lol, like this is a problem for 99.9% of people.
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:06:58


That's exactly the type of elitist attitude we need to make bitcoin the wave of the future!
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:29:07
I'm not planning on them going that low.. then again, I am obviously terrible at planning.
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:01:17
Are you aware that your website has been hacked?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:09:46
Good sport, bad trader : ( if I ever get back to my goal of ~1.5btc, I'm holding forever and adblocking the sell button on coinbase
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:38:13
Shouldn't you be encouraging them to learn about bitcoin as opposed to just encouraging them to buy in to it? If you're encouraging them to buy and they don't understand it, they probably think it's just some scam.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:25:36
Alright, my bad dude. Clearly this issue cuts deep for you. Sorry for the joke.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:50:58
I admire you and your advice. Wish I were smarter. I just sold 1 of my 1.66 bitcoins for $800 thinking I could buy in lower. It just so happens that $800 is the lowest point it has hit today. I did this a few weeks ago when it dropped to $700. I am shooting myself in the foot. I am so angry at myself right now for thinking I am smart by timing the market. I need to vent.... :GJSNGP:SOH{(UM&lt;_TU_TU*JHM&lt;_G*( HSG FNHM_G*YD_G*FDPGDFGON FDG*YN_)  _)( N_)(*G+_U}()JSOGJFPGIJ:mk keyboard smash
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:35:56
Yes, they should still honor that purchase. I bought at the same time as you but I was eligible for an instant purchase. If they cancel your order, send them an email and they should honor your purchasing price. That is the advice I have seen around this subreddit.

US national debt: $17,000,000,000,000
The number you quoted: $118,921,106
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:08:30
This is terrible and not funny at all.    
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:23:40
thanks for the reassurance!
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:55:46
You can always buy back in now!
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:20:28
Fair enough, congrats and good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:58:46
Wow you jump to decisions quickly.
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:58:29
Wow, thank you so much! That is generous of you and I do appreciate it. Enjoy your awesome care
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:46:21
Sorry, but why are you even mentioning your wedding? It's totally irrelevant to the issue at hand.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:10:09
Good post. One glaring flaw: Ferrari's are made of aluminum
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:50:03
You are a fucking idiot.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:36:09
Yes, of course. The more power added to the mining pool, the harder it becomes to mine. That applies to today and 80 years from now.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:06:17
I only have .25 of a bitcoin :( 
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:36:37
The fact that there needs to be a write-up this long about *basic* security for bitcoin makes me feel very uneasy about how viable it is as a mainstream currency.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:03:21
I am still up overall, but have definitely made poor some poor selling decisions. I'm bad at this. Just glad I bought some litecoins when they were $6 each.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:30:50
If you would have asked this question 5 hours ago, and decided to purchase 1 bitcoin at that time, you would currently be $200 richer on your investment.
There are no guarantees. This could all end up being a miserable failure and you lose everything. There are plenty of topics (new ones) regarding this. 
No one person can answer this for you. If you believe in the technology and the future of bitcoin, buy in.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:43:30
Wow, you're extremely generous. Part of me thinks maybe you got confused for a second and meant to put $1 instead of 1 BTC :)
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:26:00
LaKaShing is a cool guy. He gave me $115 after that win
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:49:35
Let's not fool ourselves. That change in price was not related to Coinbase. Point the finger China's way
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:16:58
I am certainly not putting all of my money into Bitcoin. I bought .25 last week because I am intrigued by the idea and future of bitcoin but am being very cautious. I have considered buying a whole bitcoin but am unable to fully commit. I have been reading and researching, I see all the positives but I've also read what the detractors have had to say. With my luck, I'd buy in at $235 and the market for them would crash tomorrow :(
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:45:07
Hey, if it's just money, feel free to throw some my way :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:03:34
Glad you got a good laugh at my expense :) 
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:01:30
That makes no sense. How are you going to make profit from bitcoin and then turn around and buy bitcoin with that profit? It sounds like you're assuming you can time the market perfectly (sell high, buy low) which is unlikely.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:37:25
Yes, completely. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:23:19
? In what year? It would take ages to get .02 by CPU mining today.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:38:45
If it was instant then you should already have the BTC in your account. Are you not seeing it?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:34:54
Insightful post, thank you! I feel a little bit better after reading your assessment of the situation
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:12:40
Such a badass. You do realize you're under contract with your bank, right? It would be easier to just say "Personal" and then everyone goes on their merry way. Not providing an answer will lead to a frozen account and investigation.
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:29:59
Lose as in can't find it forever? Assuming you get a new phone with your original phone number associated with it, there isn't a problem. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:19:30
I saw, still didn't buy back in, this is too insane
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:13:02
If you buy a prepaid phone at walmart or somewhere similar, I doubt you could get that number back. I would never set a 2fa on a temp phone though. If you are on a service plan with a provider, you can certainly get your number back regardless of what happens to the phone.
