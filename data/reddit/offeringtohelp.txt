Cato is certainly conservative. But government loving? Quite the opposite.

I would still suggest a qr code for them to print out and wave around. Something more tangible makes it seem more 'real' for the audience. Also, you could have them hold it up to the camera for you to scan. Heck, they could get tips from the audience.

You should email them a QR code for a public address (no private so none is stolen mid broadcast) and send them .027 btc instantly on air (also before the interview let the producer know how to check the balance in real-time). They would eat that up. Talk in terms of dollars to make more comprehensible. You'll do great.

If it's a sit down, face to face kind of thing, be ready with lots of analogies. If it's a remote, you should prepare by answering questions while looking pleasantly at a blank wall. The experience can be surreal.

I don't have time now (middle of the night here) but I plan on incorporating my church's logo with its bitcoin wallet QR code and place it in the lobby as an alternative way to support their various causes: homes for the homeless in Reynosa Mexico, shallow well infrastructure for fresh water in Malawi, homeless of St. Louis, MO, and others. Will definitely tinker. Thanks for your work.

After watching the source video, I feel sorry for the guy being interviewed and disdain for the interviewer.
The Bitpay guy mentioned 'stock split' so the interviewer would understand he was talking about half and not have. 
Interviewer takes it as an analogy and thinks, "finally, something I understand, now I can smugly dismiss this price run up.". 
Edit: Also what's up with the terrible blue screen background that guy has?

I get what you are trying to say: it's binary like pregnancy is binary, conditions are met vs conditions are not met.  However, I do like the way the previous guy used the word consensus. Consensus should be used as a shades-of-grey term because it's never absolute. Saying 'we don't have consensus' without saying what you mean by that isn't very helpful.

You should read [the Forbes article]( where they expressly rule out it being considered a tax-free split, which is what I think you mean by "stick spinoff".

Man, getting both of those at the same time would be awesome.

But how do you define the terms consensus and contentious? There isn't 100% of the community that believes Segwit is the answer to the scaling issue, or even that RBF is a great idea. Are those contentious?
@_date: 2016-06-09 18:36:44
Perhaps the confusion is due to different uses of the term? For example:  
System consensus- lightcoin will not be considered valid within in the Bitcoin network because it is not following consensus rules (incompatible).  
Ledger consensus-full nodes' agreement on the valid chain due to one having the most proof of work.  
Community consensus (governance)- am agreement on which next steps would be most beneficial to Bitcoin.  
The elegance and perfection of the first two contrasts with the last kind. Almost like there should be a different term for that.

Can you give the proper threshold for 'having' community consensus? Because I don't remember a time when any change was without detractors. Some said Classic's 75% plus however many days was to aggressive. Some say CSV's 95% is to conservative. I'm interested in your take.  
Edit: changed SPV to CSV

I'm glad you have more info under your belt. I disagree that it's a FUD piece, because I believe someone can be trying to relay information (ie pay your taxes) without having a 'side'.
I intend on filing exactly as the CPA author recommends. More bitcoin taxpayers helps to legitimize the whole space.
@_date: 2016-06-09 16:27:24
You said, 'Bitcoin doesn't change without consensus'. Softforks are clearly changes to Bitcoin. I said that support for Segwit and RBF isn't unanimous. Which leads me back to the question: What do you mean by the terms contentious and consensus?

Nope. Check eBay.

The professional brokerages and traders use software that interracts directly with exchanges.  The 'language' the software and the exchanges use to talk to one another about prices and to place orders is called [FIX](
By adding this capability, Coinbase Exchange can be integrated to the big boys' systems more easily/directly.

Charging more fare for a bus that only comes once every 10 minutes doesn't add seats to the bus.  Increasing the cost reduces use cases.

In your opinion is Any block size increase a threat? I do think the artificial 1MB limit, well, limits bitcoin's utility.
@_date: 2016-05-21 20:16:28
Two things: that's a bit of a false dichotomy to say we can either have 1MB or security but never both. Do you know anyone who says 2MB would break bitcoin?  Secondly, centralization is a concern to me as it makes a 51% attack feasible. Is this your concern with centralization? 51% doesn't seem to be anywhere near the horizon even if the limit were to double or triple.

If you need to return it, you return it with the order number, just like it was a gift (which from Amazon's perspective, it looks identical to). You get Amazon credit in return, which is fair.

I was drawn to the ideology first but have since found use for remittances. I first tried turning bitcoin to pesos during a trip to Mexico using now defunct sendbitcoin.mx or whatever that site was. I have been able to send small amounts to two Liberian students my parents met (and now support) during medical mission trips there.

Spending? Maybe just as a way to support the ecosystem and grow awareness. But I see many more reasons for holding, many more. The main one being the historical unreliability of fiat. You may call that ideological or just a realist's recognition of fiat's true nature.

I take issue with the narrative's reason for why the US exited Bretton Woods. They say there was so much demand for dollars that gold reserves were insufficient. I say overprinting dollars, plain and simple.
