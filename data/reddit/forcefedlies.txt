Same deal here, bought 6 for like $30 each.  The hard drive is sitting in my drawer that they are on..  been there for about 6 years. Probably wouldn’t work now.

Honestly it’s been out of a pc for about 8 years, multiple drawers etc. only reason I kept it was because it had pictures from my first kids birth and a bunch of my late fathers.    
I might get around to it, as of now it’s a big heavy ledger lol.   I have much more actively invested in other coins so I’m not *that* worried about it.

I always keep double my initial investment and let the rest ride.  I’ve been using “free” money to invest in crypto for awhile now.

It’ll crash and go back up again.  To think this year is any different than the past is silly.  It just dips and goes higher dips and higher each time.

Well they aren’t wrong.  If shit ever went down (wars, phenomena from space etc), crypto is useless.

If we have renewable energy thats not a big deal.  So stupid that’s still a negative thing.

Funny enough I recently just watched a vice piece in Detroit where guys use bitcoin to make fake credit cards.  We’re making 1,000 a day

I want to see the face of like a Ferrari dealer that sold one for bitcoin and then have the market crash lol
