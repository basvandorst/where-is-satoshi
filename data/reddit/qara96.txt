This is such a good reason and one of the reasons why I HODL; HODL for the future, unexpected expenses. But I can't help, as someone that has only ever known universal healthcare, why the USA still has so many that oppose it. I'm not trying to start any argument, I just am baffled why in a modern western society anyone would have to worry about being able to afford healthcare

My mother has a degree in economics, still calls bitcoin a pyramid scheme. I wanted to buy a thousand or so in 2010 when I was 12 and fist read about it on computer forums. She wouldn't let me. Haunts me to this day...

Still if they are that bothered about making money, you would think Segwit would be higher on their to-do list

I bought £30 of Bitcoin in the dip for a paper wallet as a Christmas present for my parents on GDAX as they mentioned interest in bitcoin the other day.
Transferred it out free to the wallet and on checking blockchain found they paid £25 in fees to do it... So for £30 of crypto they almost paid the same in fees... Surely they realise it would benefit them to adopt segwit sooner rather than later, its just stupid.
I don't think lightning network will fare any better tbh. People are always resistant to change, even if it eventually benefits them.

Kinda related/kinda off-topic; Bank of England has been playing around making their own crypto - RS Coin. Can't say we couldn't see it coming.

yes of course, but the transaction from coinbase was from a non-segwit source *facepalm*
