Hey Yesterday was a great day, many others including myself posted undeniable proof of the Ponzi scheme that GAW is promoting.
Why did I create this comment?
Because we need to stop GAW!
We as Redditors have done a great job at spreading the word. But there's more we can do!
What should we do?
Just like Dogecoin and many other altcoins, ShapeShift and many other services. Everybody needs to request services to remove XPY. If these services don't accept XPY then innocent investors won't get scammed.
What else can we do?
This isn't the best option, but we can spam the link of every GAW scam proof thread onto Hashtalk.

Thanks for this :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:37:21
Thanks Josh for giving me the opportunity to get shadow banned on your forum :)
Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:14:39
No, I saw it as an investment. I didn't read anything on Reddit about GAW as I was constantly told that you guys are 'stupid trolls'.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:46:32
Yes, shitcoin, scamcoin. Whatever you call it, it's a red flag.
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:53:38
Glad to see you're out.
Was it because of my post?
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:58:58
Have some coins :) $1
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:03:58
Thanks mate, can't believe I got it so popular haha.
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:46:00
Yes, completely true. The fees cost more than the payout, GAW decided to cover the cost and 'generously' give you 1 satoshi.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:41:37
HashTalk trolls...
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:35:54
nah I just chose the logo because it looked cool haha.
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:23:00
Great Job with this :)
Since a major service in crypto has done this, hopefully the fools at HashTalk will figure this out themselves.
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:57:57
Have some coins :) $1
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:00:21
No problem, the GAW cultists seem to be hard at work downvoting it though so it must be working :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:04:44
Why would I apologise to GAW? If anything, they should apologise to the investors...
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:26:49
Thank you, people need to be warned about this scammer. Hashlets don't even payout anymore, this is why GAW moved towards their own currency. What a great way to hide their Ponzi scam!
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:16:53
GAWCEO knows about this post, next thing we know he'll bring a downvote bot...
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:14:53
This is the submission link.

The scrypt fee costs more than the payout: 
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:52:51
You're pathetic, I made a loss, I brought it at $12 dollars and sold at $8. "Fight up Bitcoin and Litecoin" yeah, that's why it's at $3 dollars, because it lost!
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:29:35
Yeah, only part of the community says that. At HashTalk they just want to make themselves feel good about their horrible investment. Look at the price, it's a failure. It's never going back up.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:52:13
ahaha, I think you hate paycoin and you're trolling us?
Am I right?
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:45:35
Try and find it, if you can this is just more evidence against GAW.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:54:26
thanks mate!!!
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:45:24
Actually, I got noone into Paycoin because they all thought it was a scam, and they were right!
And secondly, I didn't pump anything since I only had 13 XPY...
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:53:46
And I have every right to want to sell at $20 dollars, just because you're butthurt your sun god didn't honour his promises.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:06:11
He doesn't even know how to spell below...
@_date: 2015-01-02 13:21:37
It's scum like this that ruin crypto for everyone.
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:03:00
Why was I banned Josh, can you explain anything on here?
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:34:59
Happy New Year to you too :)
Is there a screenshot I need to see this lol.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:41:14
You obviously can't read the OP.
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:33:49
Have fun mate $.50
@_date: 2015-01-24 05:40:17
If you end up buying the BTC. Lock it to USD with coinapult.com to protect it from the declining BTC price.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:02:28
I don't have a screenshot of the post but I posted this:
Under it I wrote, "we'll see what happens in 2 days" and then I was shadow banned.
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:25:30
You don't need to make a whole new wallet to remain anonymous...
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:32:50
Yes, it is a repost. What's the point of writing this if nobody gets to see it?
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:05:06
This is a great charity - 
Don't give bits if you don't want to, you already sent me some.
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:29:21
Thank you, I'll be sure to tip others :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:21:29
lol made me laugh $1
