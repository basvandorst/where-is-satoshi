Every chart shows bitcoin hitting 12k in a few days! Then back to all time highs from there. Congrats everyone we did it.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:42:31
Buy the dip! running to 500 billion marketcap in 2 days.
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:26:14
Could also go back down to 100 dollars and you did not sell. Hodl is not a strategy it's just stupidity.

I think this time around we might see a power bottom at some point but lets not forget the greatest man of our century. The glory moment of his past Al Bundy's life: scoring four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, "Spare Tire" Dixon

I think in the near future the bigger crypto coins will end up being ones like OmiseGo that will allow you to spend all your crypto. Not just bitcoins or eth but all coins. If they ever finish plasma it will be 1 million transactions per second and any coin can be converted on the fly. Huge project but will change the world of crypto if they pull it off. They are making plasma with the guy from ethereum who we all know is an alien.

Just heard info that bitcoin will be over 12k in one week. Good news!
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:32:57
Bitcoin to 12k within 5 hours.
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:54:08
Wow! all the charts point to 12k in a day. Amazing. I don't see it but if the charts are real btc will hit 12k then the jump to 25k. Been here for years and have seen how it works.
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:19:43
Well I will answer for him. Many people were saying this 5 months ago so it's right on time. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:07:12
7k incoming. Hold on to your privates.
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:22:16
Blockchain will live on but crypto is not needed. Governments and companies are already making their own blockchain and it has nothing to do with crypto coins. Crypto is just the nerds beanie baby. Hodl won't work after this point it's just buy and sell. Buy low sell high.

Guess you have never heard of a day trader.

Day traders have their mind made up :)
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:36:37
The bears are gone. Market going back up and will hit 1 trillion by years end so basically any coin you hold right now is gold. Next short ride will hit 450 billion marketcap. Would not even risk dumping because like I said 1 trillion by the end of the year min. We always want to make profit and guess but if it's at this price now and hits 1 trillion at the end of the year who cares. We just hit 800 billion marketcap a few months ago. Could honestly be 2-3 trillion by years end. Just get your dart boards out and toss money at any coin and you will gain over the year.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:45:54
Planning on buying from 7k down to 5k then if it breaks 5k it's not going to be pretty. Won't have reserve left at that point. It was just 10 dollars a few years ago so kind of a scary thought. I'm a smart guy and just say.. 10 dollars to 19k what could go wrong? I fear if this is a correction our price will end up under 1k but I will start my fomo at 7k and gamble.
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:36:46
When do you think it's safe to buy back in? Charts says it's going to drop to around 6k. Don't want to miss the ride up in the end.
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:29:26
Slow down, let me get my space suit on. We are mooning! Lets just hit the all time high of around 800 billion marketcap for crypto and my year is already finished. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 06:58:03
Blochain is great but crypto is going to die. Companies and governments will just make their own blockchain. Nobody needs coins made up out of thin air. You can try and say ohh but they have to be mined! How do all these ICOS start with 1 billion coins? It's a giant scam. Bernie Madoff would tear this market to shreds. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:07:54
Going to hodl my cash until we hit 6k
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:37:35
Wonder how many are getting caught in the fake bear market trap. This is a bull market 100%
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:06:31
Any ass that can make predictions is a winner in my book. I think we will touch 6k then moon. People on the sidelines are waiting for a big enough drop to all in. These small swings are only good for day traders. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:58:17
Looks like the trap suckered a lot of people back in to the market today.
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:59:25
The FOMO is real and going to hurt a lot of people when this market crashes back down to reality. When Asia wakes up it's going to be a bloodbath. Everyone who bought when the market was around 270 billion market cap is going to sell for a nice profit which will cause a chain reaction of stop loss orders kicking in. Free fall. Next stop in a few hours maybe even under 250 billion total marketcap for all coins. Load up on tether now, you heard it here first.
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:53:22
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:26:31
The positive influence is that the marketcap for all coins was around 800 billion a few months ago. Not sure how long you have been in to crypto but it drops in the early months of the year then rockets. Look at the charts son. People getting taxes back always pump the market. Live and learn son.
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:02:54
This is a dream come true. Keep pumping so I can keep dumping! this is a bear market for months at least. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:36:23
You have to love the chat. So many people say people are losers for not selling when bitcoin hit 20k well everyone is a loser for not mining when it was 1 cent. Nobody knows the future unless you are an insider. Works both ways. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 05:27:37
Time to buy tether and wait for the trap!
@_date: 2018-03-20 07:08:06
Blockchain will live on but crypto is not needed. It's a fad and will die by the end of the year. Beanie babies and tulip bulbs. Just look in the mirror and say. WTF! These coins are made up on the fly? You know you can mine massive amounts of coins if you make a coin. Yeah the federal reserve have been printing money forever but they are backed by the United States of America! Even though we know the federal reserve is a scam but they have a country backing them. Nothing backs coins. Just people getting rich off suckers. I have a lake to sell you in the desert if you want to buy it from me. Will not sell it for bitcoins but for real cash that the world accepts as a global currency!
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:18:10
The ship is sicking!!!!!!!!!!!! down to 1k again bear market!
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:18:27
We all know FOMO ends very badly. There will be a huge dump soon probably the total marketcap will hit around 250 billion for all coins. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:36:13
Was this pump just another trap?
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:03:33
You sound like a Jedi master and you are correct but it can go either way at any price.
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:18:44
This is a huge Bull Trap. Sell for tether if the market hits 330 billion marketcap. It's getting close. The whales are going to crush it soon. Tomorrow we will see a total 250 billion marketcap. That's where I draw my line in the sand and all in.
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:47:38
To the moon!!! all time high will be hit soon.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:53:32
The fomo is really kicking in to gear now. The whales love it because they will dump in to it.
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:47:22
Many people said that when bitcoin was dropping and still around 15k. Damn I missed it! 
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:05:14
And it's gone.
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:21:04
Looks like the big bank money is coming in so 12k in a week for bitcoin digital gold.
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:34:51
This is a huge trap. It's going to get bloody when it crashes. Will wipe out all the stop losses and cause a chain reaction.
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:29:56
Totally agree. It can be argued both ways. Of course if you are the rich guy with 80 billion in the bank you might say I earned that money. I just don't see how it's justified that a ceo can be worth 20 30 40 or 80 billion dollars. That's enough money to buy a country. Or start an army bigger then many countries. Who really earned that money? The CEO or the slaves working for them?
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:25:26
Anything you finance means you can't afford it.
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:35:14
It's now under 9000!! run for the hills! 5k incoming ! When people talk about things with this Vegeta thing you know they only have like 100 dollars in the market.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:46:40
Think this was a bear trap. Think about it. We were at 800 billion market cap a few months ago. Lost over 50% of that. This was a planned bear trap. The big boys are loading up now. 345 billion marketcap for all coins? lol. The stock market went up like 70 trillion in the past 10 years. This market is pure money. Find solid coins, hold get rich. That's life. Just search for the next Amazon and google. Millions. Enjoy. Lol. It's not tether printing it's people taking profits putting money in to tether. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:59:35
Scary. I left stocks a long time ago knowing that they are fully manipulated to finish off the rich and poor game they have going on. The rich don't like the middle class. Bye 401k! Bye money! I was totally wrong though and thought it would dump years ago but the federal reserve can print trillions of dollars whenever it wants and has  been keeping it up. Companies I loved when I was a kid going under every few months. Toys R US is closing all it's stores so another couple hundred K people on food stamps but the economy is booming according to the DOW. I think we will end up living through the next great depression in our lifetime. Really sucks then WW III. After the 2000 crash then 2008 crash we are well overdue for a massive crash. I don't see the Dow being worth more then 6k right now. Nothing Justifies it. Good thing if you own a home the housing prices will rocket. I'm going to take profit this time around and live in a damn tent if I have to. The rich move around from game to game. We are just squirrels in the game trying to find a nut. It's their game and they will never lose but we can get that nut every once in awhile. Just hope when the Dow fully crashes they will move to the new market which is crypto. The ones that survive that is. You just have to love people calling crypto a bubble when the marketcap is around 330 billion and around 70 trillion has been pumped in to other markets in the past 10 years. That's the depression bubble. Where did this money come from? Printed by the federal reserve. Imagine being able to just print money.. Again what could go wrong in the end lol. Wish you the best when the world economy crashes. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:10:52
A break under 8500 should lead to further downside. Not sure how long you have been gambling on stocks or bitcoins but this is a trap. Does not matter how high the price goes it's a bear market so in the end it's going way down. Just imagine the market going from 10 dollars to 19000 but crank that in reverse. I want to buy back around 5k but if it's real bitcoin could go back to 2k
If you look at the past it's done this many times. Even I have Fomo. 5k is my final stand. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:15:26
This is the last time you will see BTC under 7k. April will be the start of the run all the way through to December again.

People don't understand statistics. In America after Hurricane Katrina they decided to send a certain race to one of the lowest crime rate states in the country and the crime shot up 1000 percent. Some races are just more violent then others. Don't care why they are but it's a proven statistic. In America black people make up 13% of the population but 60% of the jail population so imagine how many have not been caught. There are many nice pitbulls out there also I'm sure but 99% of death my dog in America is from a pitbull. Stick with statistics and it will keep you a lot safer.

The only money I have laundered is when I leave a 5 dollar bill in my pocket and do the laundry. If you enjoy paying taxes then have fun doing it. Don't include me in your game. Are you one of those guys that gets a proud feeling when he pays his earned money to the government? They won't do shit for you pal so it might sink in someday.

Evolution is also a real thing. The Roman Empire was very advanced thousands of years ago while some were throwing spears a few hundred years ago living in mud huts. Greece, Rome, so many great things built there. You can yell racism but it's just more facts. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:45:59
I don't keep any money in the bank. Just to pay bills. So it's small amounts. I can technically pay every bill with the card accept my mortgage. That's the whole reason we should be in crypto. I was going to tell you how to do it but worrying about taxes, which is basically theft is not my big concern. The IRS is a corrupt bunch of thieves, just ignore them until things actually happen then deal with it.

Thanks George Soros for that. The old Geezer want's to destroy the world before he kicks off. Why else would Europe bring in massive amounts of refugees? Destabilizing stable places gives people more power. Basically the Muslims already won and will rule the world someday. England is for sure gone. No go zones all over Europe. We don't have no go zones in America but we just choose never to go there.

Is that what you say everyday when you look in the mirror?
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:08:00
Totally agree with you. If I mined bitcoin at 1 cent and it hit 1 dollar I probably would have sold it all lol. Bragging to friends about the huge gain I just made then look back today and it's still over 6k. So kind of glad I did not mine at 1 cent. Just adding up how much I would have had today would be a huge pain. I'm sure most people sold out early.
