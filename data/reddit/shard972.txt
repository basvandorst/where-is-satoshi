Yes, he's coming to free the bitcoins of those that never wavered in their faith for mtgox. Those that ignored all the evidence of wrongdoing of months previous will be rewarded.

Maybe Gox is coming back to save us all! Bitcoin is not dead!

Well I wish they would give me my coins, been waiting an hour now and they haven't even initiated a withdraw yet.

I think you just put a chill down my spine thinking that some people actually still believe MTGox is still legit.

Yep, Great job they have been doing over the last decade. So great that they barely have had to arrest anyone.


Are you trolling or just brain damaged?
To say that all you need to do is post a screencap of a chart and you can ruin someones reputation is only somewhat believable if you ignore everything MtGox have ever done to errode their own reputation.

It's possible they are being DDOSed but I'm not seeing anything come from their twitter yet.

Thanks for the info.
I think I will spend the next few weeks watching localbitcoins to see how they go to decide wether or not I want to use them again. It's hard though with most Australian companies bailing out due to having to now pay GST (10% sales tax) on purchasing bitcoins.

Like they could even track it.

You say that but I bought some gold back when it was around $400, If you account for inflation my gold did much better than the US stock market over the same period.

Taxation requires regulation otherwise people will just walk around it.
@_date: 2014-11-03 02:38:37
I prefer governments have no control or regulatory responsibility over digital currencies. If they want to create their own digital currencies for their citizens good for them but they didn't create any of these coins so they should have no say about them.

Duh, this was all a temporary thing. I mean, they told us everything was fine:

With my US bank account that is paying below CPI intrest? That is what you call "grows exponentially".
@_date: 2013-01-09 03:34:46


In a practical sense when you consider the US economy as it stands today but go to other countries or rewind the clock a few years and you can easily find banks that offer a decent intrest.

I'm pretty sure the value of a $100 dollar bill sitting under my mattress is worth and will always be worth the value of $100 sitting in my bank account.

Hold on now, you are talking about investing in bonds. There is a difference then investing in government debt and saving your money in a bank.
Also to your previous point, Inflation is historically bad for bond holders because it is by definition the devaluing of the currency that you will be paid back with at a future date.

You can't just redefine savings to "investing in bonds". While a bank might use savings through the fractional reserve system to invest in bonds the customer is still saving their money in the bank. If the bonds that were invested in tank then the customer doesn't loose their money because the customer never invested their money, they saved it.
