Because they've already gotten their cut from the bank. Now they need some bubble from the bitcoin. They want a position and a couple for their friends as "officers" and "managers" at each company.

Yeah, most of Europe didn't have too much trouble switching to Euro 15 yrs ago. If people are told "It's how we do things now" or "It's better- not as much fees" everyone will switch. Or perhaps "combine" is the best term. BTC won't be strange or difficult to adopt for more than 1-2 yrs. By 2020, there'll barely be a reference to the change- just like the Euro.

The flip side is 'Murica that some places only accept cash or card. I have no card. Am BTC/cash only right now. And sometimes they have a problem with the cash. It's hard to verify. If it's a machine, it's a piece of shit that can't scan a dollar and be ok with the corner being a bit bent. If it's a human, they'll say "No, you can't buy $1.78 bag of chips with a $50... spend more." OR "I don't have change" and of course if the cops pull me over and see that I have $900 in cash, they'll assume I'm a drug dealer and confiscate it ....... etc..............

Is that absolutely true or just relative to the current political state we are in (a virtual corporatocracy)? I'm sure if Obama became the dictator Neocons claim he already is and made bitcoin the only approved currency it would still flourish.

You don't need laws to permit anything. Lack of laws=permission. In the US, regulation of bitcoin can be seen as a good thing, but if you could create an "oasis" such as St Kitts and Nevis, you don't "need" anything. Just let it *be.*

Targeting the exact same people that are already interested in Bitcoin is what is stupid. You need to think a little bigger- target the people that would normally scoff, make fun of, and dismiss bitcoin. Win their hearts and minds and that is what will get BTC mainstream. Starting with Nascar, UFC is good. Ending up on Oprah for funding a school in Africa would be ideal (You get a bitcoin! You get a bitcoin! Everyone gets a bitcoin!). 
You may not like the idea, but it is what needs to happen.

You bring up a good point, but no, you can never figure out the government's intentions. I've seen the IRS lie through their teeth to get nothing yet destroy a company, whereas they could have collected more tax, even though the company was doing nothing wrong. I guess a shutdown was more important than more $$ to that agent's career.

For those that aren't aware, Paul Graham was an investor and mentor to Reddit and the cofounders. He also did the same with Coinbase. If you take a look at his track record, he's pretty spot on. Of course, he also just stepped down as President of Y Combinator, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. So, what does Sam Altman think of bitcoin?
Also, his essays are [pretty good reads!](

Ha ha, apparently I've found them! And I've pissed them off ;) Seriously, though, there's an exception to every rule and you being on Reddit is proof of that. Do you really think you're the rule for your generation? And I said shun, not "unable to figure it out." There's a difference.
I know old people can grasp it, it just depends on if they WANT to. My parents quickly learned email, smartphones, etc... and they're into their late 60s, but they still buy newspapers, magazines and paperback books (that sit next to their iPads!). If/when bitcoin becomes mainstream, they'll adapt pretty quickly, but as long as it is "fringe" as it is now, they won't care. That was my point. If Starbucks goes bitcoin-only. OK, I can see that.
