It sounds like you're exactly the type of person who'd fall for such an unintelligible metric.
The point is, it doesn't represent any decline of any currency, period.

Wow you got upset real quick didn't you now :)
To my knowledge I've never spoken to, nor had any direct or indirect correspondence with them.
If inventing such a narrative in your head makes you feel happier in life, I'd **thoroughly** recommend assuming a more profound sense of satisfaction in life than making things up about anonymous people online who you've never met.
When you think about it objectively, it's actually pretty sad dude :(

You're missing the joke.

For what reason do you suggest this?
I'm curious to hear your predicted dollar value, by what year and I suppose for what reason also.

Aaand there we have it
if you ever wanted to see someone's self-professed admission of losing a debate, the above post does it as succinctly as possible.
I think my work here is done :)

You don't believe the crypto space has a place in your portfolio, period?
I'm very curious to see how diversified you are. I'm all about hearing from the more rational thinkers who've considered BTC as a hedge.

You're failing to grasp the concept.

I would say, if you feel you're solely responsible for them making such a risky financial decision, be sure to put a limit on the amount of their money you're about to be responsible for. It's a huge burden on yourself otherwise.
If you're uncomfortable with that level of responsibility, stress the idea of them doing their own impartial research first.

Well done in making a series of claims as unsubstantiated as they are bold

"Time in the market &gt; timing the market", for if you're not familiar with the mantra.
Even every novice long-investor trying to secure long-term gains in the stock-market also knows is giving catastrophically bad advice. Your initiation into secure financial thinking essentially involves ignoring idiotic advice from people such as him.
Your position should be one where you're perfectly comfortable with dips and crashes across your portfolio, essentially being able to weather the storm and possibly double down (with maybe an excess 3-5% cash to DCA back in when things go 'on sale').
Plan and save for a possible 3-6 months of hardship, or whatever you may face, in cash. The logic should be that if everything else you had dipped in price, your life as you know it would not be in utter ruin, and that you'll survive.
If you establish your finances this way, you should be able to HODL your investments and be sound with that.
**NOTE**: HODL'ing is a concept ubiquitous across the realm of smart retail investors. They just happen to not have a meme for it like we do.

For some reason your use of capital letters makes me mildly irate.

I can't stand it when an anonymous news article, posted on a website without EVEN so much as a reputation on which to ride, mixes entirely unsubstantiated claims (ctrl+f "seem"|"seems") with facts surrounding still-contentious and debatable issues, all while completely failing to unify the listed points with the original claim of said article.
This is an unequivocal abuse of the straw-man argument, and is also both an insult to journalistic integrity and the intellectual capacity of the readers of this subreddit.

Maybe, or maybe not Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:28:29
It would be brilliant of you to substantiate such a claim qualitatively, if only to help enrich both crypto adoption and this subreddit.

That hedge fund managers wouldn't, as you claim, touch bitcoin with a figurative twenty foot 'poll'.
"ubiquitous advice, for hedge fund managers" is also oxymoronic, and negates the crux of the argument for what is clearly the intended audience I'm addressing. 
Even a conservative investors would seriously consider augmenting their EM weighting with perhaps a 5% split with something like BTC.

Hmm, you’ll need to be sure you have your private keys and I’d recommend being exceptionally carefully... Basically you want to sweep the BTC into a new (segwit)  address then use my old wallet / private key in a virtual machine.
Download coinomi, then try importing the private key to the new address. You can swap it to electrum after. If you want to be safe you can send your bitcoin to a new address first, then check the pre-RBF mempool for the original private key sent to Coinomi. Coinomi is available on the play store.
Good luck!

Would you say there is an argument against me selling some of my position right now, then buying back in for cheap after Sunday?

Good to hear their stances, and to be honest very reasonable points from both imo.
1st world SMEs are probably most concerned with using existing infrastructure to help increase their bottom line. As shockingly quick as BTC adoption could very well be, they will most likely wait for (e.g LN-based) platforms in order mitigate the overhead required for adoption.
r.e GS - I'm sure many would love to see the price stabalize; fortunately for us the volume that needs to be pumped in before that happens is right at the door.
