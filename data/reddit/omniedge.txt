OK but Coinbase has chosen to start experimenting running BitcoinXT that has integrated BIP101. A BIP is a design document for introducing features or information to Bitcoin and not BitcoinXT.

It is amazing indeed to see that BIPS 100 was only started 2 days ago while the XT fork was meant to be last resort. Mike and Gavin have the right to fork but I don't agree with the road that they have taken. Open source combined with money results in many stakeholders but their current choices are fragmenting the diversity which made Bitcoin so attractive, at least to my brain. It's open consensus based decision making is slow but steady. Why suddenly the rush!
For a system based on mathematics, logic and science I am bewildered to see so many emotions and even the malicious and unjustified harming of person's reputation. The trolling is gaining strength in this sub.

MaidSafe is basically creating decentralized applications for anything. They want to decentralize all aspects of the internet. Storj on the other hand is specifically decentralized data storage (dropbox like service). They can work together. Super3 from Storj quote: "If a particular protocol or software does something well, then we should just integrate it into Storj instead of reinventing the wheel."
Bittorent sync: Not sure about that one but specs are  [here](
Add Ethereum to the mix and quote from Ursium:
"Ethereum has storage capabilities but mostly for state information, not file storage. You would never say, upload a video to the Ethereum chain. Maidsafe is a decentralized storage layer. Ethereum is a decentralized logic layer. The two would work together, for example in the context of creating a decentralized dropbox application."

An open source wifi mesh network does not need ISP:
An ad hoc network infrastructure that can be set up by anyone, mesh networks wirelessly connect computers and devices directly to each other without passing through any central authority or centralized organization (like a phone company or an ISP). They can automatically reconfigure themselves according to the availability and proximity of bandwidth, storage, and so on; this is what makes them resistant to disaster and other interference. Dynamic connections between nodes enable packets to use multiple routes to travel through the network, which makes these networks more robust.

If Bitcoin is a bubble, it is a bubble that began deflating on November 29 2013. At its proudest moment the price of one unit of the much-ballyhooed virtual currency was $1,242, which meant the value of all the Bitcoins in the world was just under $14bn.
These days it trades mostly in a range of $450-$650 a coin and at a market cap of $6.5bn. The jury is still out on whether the Bitcoin technology will prove robust and the currency itself will find mainstream use. If the answer to either question is no, then no amount of hot air is likely to keep the price at current levels.
But even as the Bitcoin price decays, there is another candidate for the bubble label: the market for the specially designed computers that hold the Bitcoin network together and “mine” for newly minted coins.
Nicolas Courtois, a senior cryptography lecturer at University College London, has calculated that at least $1bn has been invested in this “mining equipment”, and some miners, who wish not to be identified, suggest that could be a modest estimate.
Prices for the latest computer hardware have been chased higher because investors have required faster and faster machines to make narrower and narrower profits mining for Bitcoin.
Mr Courtois estimates a majority of investors are making a loss.
“It has been a very bad experience for most investors and a jackpot for a few lucky ones,” he says. “The bottom line is that the production of mining machines was much higher than expected and advertised.”
Bitcoin price
Miners are central to the operation of the virtual currency. Linked together, they are the peer-to-peer network that confirms transactions and maintains the online ledger showing where all the Bitcoins are. New coins are their reward for taking part, but the likelihood of getting a coin has decreased as more miners come online and the number of Bitcoins approaches the maximum allowed.
When the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakomoto created the virtual currency in 2009, he envisioned a decentralised market powered by ordinary users operating equipment no more sophisticated than a MacBook. But now development costs for the most cutting-edge technology, in US dollar terms, can run into the double-digit millions. The biggest miners now run large rigs, sometimes filling entire warehouses, with giant fans to keep them cool.
Bitcoin mining difficulty
Bitcoin folklore has it that a savvy German miner known as ArtForz worked out how to adapt graphics processors (GPUs), the sort found in video game technology, to run the Bitcoin algorithm much more efficiently in 2010, sparking today’s arms race. The era of Bitcoin mining farms chock full of precariously placed cables and energy-intensive overheating processors – evocative of Star Trek’s Borg villains – had begun.
“We’ve paid between $10m and $15m for the development of our 20 nanometre technology, depending on what you include in those costs,” says Nanok Bie, director of marketing at KnCMiner, a Sweden-based miner that develops rigs for commercial distribution.
Bitcoin miners' revenue
The 20 nanometres refers to the size of the microchip that makes the cryptographical computations needed to process Bitcoin transactions and hunt for new coins.
Once the preserve of libertarians and technowonks, Bitcoin began attracting more attention last year, when the price of a single coin climbed in fits and starts from just $14 at the beginning of January 2013. Believers argued it could replace what they claim are devaluation-prone fiat currencies, or undercut traditional payments processors such as Visa and MasterCard or banks.
In recent weeks, the price has again been volatile. An increasing number of companies have won headlines by announcing they will accept Bitcoin as payment for online transactions, but these firms typically cash in their Bitcoin for dollars or other currencies immediately on receipt. This has created the situation where increased adoption of the currency can depress, rather than increase, the price.
The price weakness further narrows the margins on Bitcoin mining, spurring ever greater desperation to obtain the latest equipment. Buyers of mining computers report having to pay in advance for machines that take months to arrive, and internet discussion boards are full of accusations of unscrupulous sellers delaying delivery so they can use machines for themselves, or failing to deliver what they promise at all.
As interest in Bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currency
Firms such as KnCMiner and rivals Butterfly Labs and Cointerra are among those hoping to expand sales beyond Bitcoin adherents to investors who believe alternative virtual currencies, such as Dogecoin or Litecoin or other Bitcoin copycats, might break through to the mainstream as well.
These manufacturers are hopeful that all the investment in their industry will spur innovation. As well as ultra-fast, ultra-efficient chips, future technological developments could include mining rigs whose excess heat is channelled to heat homes, or investments in low-cost energy production such as solar power, says Mr Bie.
For now, says Mr Courtois, a number of players are willing to mine Bitcoin at a loss, either in the hope of a long-term turnround, or to support the system, or to get hold of a currency that is anonymous and untraceable and therefore useful in illicit transactions.
Economics, however, may well catch up with the whole system. The fate of Bitcoin and its miners are tied together, and the outcome will decide whether the whole virtual currency experiment is ultimately labelled a bubble.

If it has been built before 7 April 2014 then:
type in terminal:sudo apt-get update
type in terminal: sudo apt-get upgrade openssl

The Ecological footprint is reduced while contributing to it's economy. The reason people are poor is simply because there are no jobs. For a small hotel - We have 18 full time formal workers, they have access to interest free loans, we pay our local taxes and contribute positively to our local community. My Daughter goes to the local school and we are part of that community. I am a big believer of spending your money on business that apply a triple bottomline. And spending it at the cheapest place does not mean you are helping the local economy, environment and it's population. I am proud to see my workers learning new skills, building decent houses and them spending more money at the local market. It has a multiplier effect and local people benefit as a worker, farmers or business provider. We are trying our best and sensibly contributing towards the sustainable development of our community.

Yes, because I believe Bitcoin and Ethereum can co-exist and create synergism. Ethereum is currently at a Proof of concept stage and they are moving forward. Ether isn't just a currency, it's the fuel for the Ethereum network. Bitcoin wouldn't work as this fuel (since it's external to Ethereum and not under the control of that system). Bitcoin transmits value using it's own currency and is great at doing that. Trading back-and-forth between bitcoin and ether should be quick and easy.
In case Ethereum fails at least I tried by contributing and Bitcoin is one cryptocurrency experience richer.

Localbitcoin is an option but many feel not comfortable with this. People don't trust the national mail with value. They would use fedex/dhl but costs make it not practical.
There is currently only one company that is offering local electronic remittances to their clients using a local company that is regulated by the national financial regulator. This platform makes it possible to use your mobile phone to transfer local currency and send them everywhere inside the country. In order to convert into real fiat bills you will need to go to the nearest approved agency. In the capital for examples there are a couple of dozens agencies so that makes it very interesting. I need to talk to them.

All democratic countries have a government they deserve. 
Meaning that there is a constant push by corporate lobbyist together with politicians who try to get what they want. If the people who have elected these representatives do not  let their voices being heard and  do not hand-in formally written letters and join groups then there is no counterbalance and big interests gets away with it. They get away with it because they have not done anything illegal and are working according to law and bureaucratic methods.
So if we are to busy working, taking care of our families, consuming, watching mass media and believe in artificial problems then we will never be able to focus on the real issues. And in the end of the day we are all so freaking exhausted.

Open source innate characteristics is of constant adaptation and evolution on global and decentralised level. Look at other open source ecosystem such as Linux &amp; Android to mention a few and you can see the same pattern of diversity, efficiency and global cooperation. 
This results is many flavours being developed and mutually benefit from each other experiences as 'holons' would (which is something that is simultaneously a whole and a part).
Observing and learning from nature the same conclusions can be made that diversity is key and convergence between these different eco-systems generate synergies and result in a more resilient system. Change is a natural and a constant process and if we constantly adapt using real time indicators that are available to all as in open source then we will constantly improve 'any' system.

SWARM is a distributed crowdfunding platform.
If you own SWARMcoin you are rewarded by a percentage of equity from all the businesses in the SWARM network.
- For example, if you have a great Bitcoin business idea you can get it funded through SWARM. Your business would issue its own token on the Counterparty protocol and act as digital shares for the company.
The SWARM network would receive a percentage of your company’s token and have it funneled back to the SWARMcoin holders.
The beauty of this is you don’t strictly need venture capitalists to fund businesses. The capital comes from all the participants in the network who are SWARMcoin holders. This levels the playing field, allowing anyone with an internet connection to participate and invest. Unlike Kickstarter you now have a stake in the companies you fund because their tokens can be traded on the free market. The SWARM network decides which businesses they want in the network by due diligence and voting with SWARMcoins.
SWARMcoin is being issued on the Counterparty protocol and will utilize Vennd (both are open source).
But correct it is risky. Isn't the "whole" crypto eco system currently swimming in a legal grey area...?

Agreed but in the case of less developed countries, rules seem and are different. Using my bank account in Europe is different compared to where I currently am. I feel like more barriers are being created by regulators in order to comply and apply best practises recommended by all the different global financial institutions. So smaller nations need to behave extraordinary in comparison to wealthy nations. I guess an analogy would be female workers rights/wages/productivity compared to their male counterparts.

You are correct on both points. I was not clear. My point was your point  "Already had a bitcoin address in clipboard and didn't correctly copy the Circle address when pasting, so it went to previously copied address"

I appreciate your example and thanks for the micro tip. 
There is place for off-chain transaction in the eco-system. But for control freaks, we like the security of the blockchain and our bitcoins in a wallet we control. Off-chain wallets is putting trust in a third party.
That said, the more diverse the eco-system the more resilient the system. Different services in the bitcoin space fill the need of different markets.

In my humble opinion, It does not have to be a problem.The nature of open source is to voluntarily join or leave a network which can lead to a fork. It's our freedom to choose. Common causes of forks are disagreements (sometimes purely ideological) and personality clashes, though more practical reasons are also common (such as the Webkit and Firefox examples). It is also interesting to see that many times the forks have surpassed the original software in popularity.
But this time the software is Bitcoin which has a value attached and many of us prefer to play it safe when it comes to our money. A fork will lead to volatility in supply/demand unless it is a popular one so a fork while not ideal is at least an option.
Bitcoin's development is entering a stage where big interest want to absorb, modify and alter it's core principles in the name of mainstream acceptance. This is not needed since the bitcoin eco system is providing services such as Circle, Xapo, Coinbase, off-chains transactions that capture the need of that 90%.
As a solution: I think it is in the best interest of all stakeholders to keep Bitcoin's core protocol neutral and apply these differences at a more "democratic" level...

Miner motivation is to move their resource to the most valuable chain. So they could leave Bitcoins Blockchain and dedicate their resources to another chain that has become more valuable. 
Voting power lies with the miners that are becoming more and more centralised and a "coup de chain" on Bitcoin and bitcoin becomes more probable. Competition is a great but I am afraid that these big interest will facilitate the migration to a chain that is more appropriate to their interest and not towards a neutral chain like Bitcoin.
I hope I am wrong but is the above scenario technically possible? Or does the blockchain and BTC function as the mother chain of all other sidechains?

If this can not be hard coded just like miners are rewarded for securing the blocks (DAC style) then we need the businesses running for profit to not only donate towards mass adoption but also to the core developers, nodes and other layers that keep the bitcoin system operational.

@_date: 2014-12-14 14:28:20
Price of Bitcoins is currently only important to the block rewards by creating new bitcoins. Miners want a high price because of these new coins. The other important factor is transaction fees which becomes more important with the reduction in new bitcoins being created. Satoshi designed it so that miners, with time, will make their money with the transaction fees only. The transition is hard coded and the rules are clear. The issuing of the currency is rewarded by hard work and securing the network. Once the issuing reduces then transaction fees and volumes become the new incentive to keep on mining.
Miners will be fine because difficulty self adjusts, transaction fees can increase and if blocksize is slightly increased more transaction fees can be accumulated in a block reward and miners earn more.

Good that Roger had PGP signed message. But seriously, from now on Bitcoin businesses should also anonymously and securely store an online distributed proof of existence for any document on the blockchain. Proof of Existence can be used to demonstrate document ownership without revealing the information it contains, and to provide proof that a document was authored at a particular time. A simple hash is all that is needed and there are several sites providing this service.
This is a legal killer APP that Bitcoin solves. Start using it.

It's a tiny, tiny fraction of America, maybe about .05 percent of the relevant funders of campaigns....And the point is, if the funders are not the people, which they are not when they are this tiny fraction of the 1 percent, it can't help but corrupt the way our government functions."

Agree but Europe brought us freedom of movements of goods, service and people. That's powerful. Having a nationalistic government is going to take that away.  We need to think global (one planet) and act local. Just as nature is made of lots of interdependent ecosystems.
The real issue is to make the power structure smaller. We should not give governments more power. Yet we are and when a new administration takes over that power, be it nationalistic and populist or something else, they will have that power in their control. History has shown that it usually gets abused. The illusion of choice for left and right is a joke especially in France where all politicians graduate from the same school. Power centralises and eventually corrupts. Legal exploitation is part of our human history. Nazi germany was legal, Vietnam was legal, segregation/apartheid was legal, colonialism was legal, Slavery was legal. Humans are amazing at justifying their moral superiority.

Nothing is guaranteed 100% in life. The developers could force a new upgrade or fork but if the users (miners, exchanges, wallets and others in the bitcoin ecosystem) do not agree they don't need to accept the upgrade/fork.

Sure, a new coin or old coin are the same. My point is that that the reward halving will change the **inflation** rate in Bitcoin.


Inflation according to monetarist is an increase in the money supply. Sure, they fell out of favour in the 80's but the economists that took over did not do particularly well.


No wage correction, a lot of people in debt. It's a debt based system so deflation doesn't work.


True it only works if it is functional. After all the negativity, astroturfing, scams, mt.gox and so on Bitcoin is growing especially if you look at the key indicators. It's still early days but the future could be very bright. Increasing demand on the horizon :-)


The protocol does exactly what it was programmed to do - Limit the supply to 21 million. The only way to change this is to pass a very contentious hard fork. The majority of people have lost trust in current political and economical systems. So at inception Satoshi created an open sourced system with a very clear proposal. People know what they are in for. Look at BitcoinXT or Bitcoin classis and they have failed the 'coup de chain'. They tried to change something even less significant such as the blocksize.


Bitcoin has been quite a stable currency lately. As the pool of BTC increases in value changes in supply and demand will have less of an impact on price changes. It's still a small pool of water. 
Volatility can be solved by locking the value of bitcoins to more stable assets such as US$. In the end, it's the freedom of making a choice and finding what the right balance is for you. The Bitcoin ecosystem are finding solutions.


This doesn't really follow. If you can elaborate perhaps I can agree or at least see what you're trying to point out. 
I went on a tangent. But what i was trying to say is that all systems have boundaries beyond which they break; in political and economical systems that boundary is excessive centralization. Bitcoin or Ethereum, their blockchain and the transparent, trustless system they have created have the potential to swing the pendulum back toward a more democratic economic and political system. 


I agree, it does not mean a bump in price. In my opinion it will help give an upward pressure. Bitcoin could drop to zero or go to the moon.


Sure but Iceland would supply even cheaper electricity with the right cooling conditions. Cheap and renewable energy is on the move. These are really exciting time ahead of us with tech and energy and human conscience growing. I hope we can build our economy on open systems. So to paraphrase Andreas: "While the future of currency is undoubtedly digital, it can take two radically different forms. We can live in a financial panopticon, a straitjacket of surveillance and tyranny. Or we can live in an open society where our privacy is protected by cryptography, not subject to the whim of every petty bureaucrat — where our digital money is global, borderless, anonymous, and controlled by the individual. The choice between financial freedom and financial tyranny is a choice between fundamental freedom and tyranny. Choose financial freedom: choose freedom."

I agree that less coins being created will lessen the price drop (reduce downward pressure). But IMHO, newly issued coins are different compared to the coins that are already on the market. The coins on the market can be held, sold or bought. The new ones can be considered an increase in the money supply and enter the market which equals to inflation. Some economist prefer this increase in supply which seems to be favoured in a debt based economy. Deflation does not work when you are in debt.
Satoshi's decreasing-supply algorithm was chosen because it approximates the rate at which commodities like gold are mined - scarcity is valuable. Because the monetary base of bitcoins cannot be expanded, the currency would be subject to severe deflation if demand increases. 
Bitcoin is global, decentralised-ish and censorship resistant. These conditions make it ideal as safe storage which is a type of demand. Another is that it becomes a settlement layer or the masses can use it to buy a cup of coffee. It's the start of breaking down borders and complicates compliance. So demand will likely increase but my assumption was that demand stayed equal. Therefore by tightening the creation of new coins the pressure to drop the price reduces which means that the pressure to increase increases.
The halving will be good for the price and let's not forget that all transitions bring turbulence but it it will be eventually good. The halving will be the start to cultivate a fee culture. Supply and demand will create new conditions for the miners. It is a very competitive space and they will adapt to new needs and locations that create favourable conditions for them. Some will go bust and others will see an opportunity. The rate of adaptation for a miner is key to survival.

 Let's make the assumption that demand stays the same and supply is the variable. Another debatable assumption is that the majority of miners will sell those coins. Therefore, when new coins are created they add on to the total supply of potential coins for sale. If X are all the coins for sale and Y are the new coins being made of which the majority will be sold then the total amount of coins for sale increases. Some of the coin sellers will need to sell faster than others and will need to sell them cheaper. So a decrease in the increase in supply of coins for sale will generate less pressure to sell cheaper. *edit: clarity.

Really valid points in the article but regarding  I am still pondering on it. IMHO, BTC is and will be used as a store of value while ether is and will be consumed by applications. Both have their intrinsic strength and could become fully interconnected.
Rootstock could change this but currently it does not exist. Blockstream, a company I respect and trust, even had to change direction to federated sidechains because they could not figure out a fully decentralised sidechain. Ethereum in the meanwhile has the first mover advantage with decentralised potential and is moving forward.

There is no contender to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is amazing at what it does. 
There is arguably one coin that complements Bitcoin in smart contract space. Especially if you care about all the principles of Bitcoin such decentralised governance, censorship resistance, immutability / untampered history; free from external interference and subjective tampering of transactions. 
Having a separate protocol with POW mining without central control brings greater security. Rootstock and sidechains will be built on top of Bitcoin and are mindblowing technologies but putting all eggs in one basket seems against security principles.

Love Bitcoin and what RSK coukd bring on the table but I wonder about the merged mining with and hope someone could clarify.
Bitcoin miners are currently centralised. This will hopefully solve itself once ASIC's become more affordable and become more distributed around the globe. I still wonder if adding RSK to bitcoin miners creates even more centralisation issues. If the powers that be go after the bitcoin miners they will achieve 2 things in one go. There is bitcoin (safe storage &amp; settlement payer) and RSK (smart contracts) that will go down. 
If the goal is also to prevent centralisation risks does it not make sense to use Ethereum Classic as a separate entity  (protocol &amp; POW mining) offering smart contracts and complement each other like holons but without lowering our security/decentralisation standards? 
Could it be that BTC and ETC are stronger and more decentralised together instead of putting all our eggs in one basquet...

This means a change in protocol that uses an algorithm resistant to mining centralization. Core developers could switch Bitcoin’s hashing algorithm from Proof-of-Work to something more appropriate and doesn't become an easy attack vector when they control too much of the network hashrate. Mining pools are able to censor transactions, which means they can also be coerced by governments into censoring certain types of transactions.
The problem is that nothing like that has been proposed and time tested.

Full nodes that are mining are the masters. XT only needs 75% of them to make a contentious fork a reality. Currently, they will follow the protocol that benefits them the most. It would be in their interest to ask for bigger blocks since more transactions can be processed resulting in more profits for the miners. They could not care less about the politics and philosophies around the topic. It seems that "some end users" also don't care and just want an efficient and cheap way to transfer value.
Bitcoin holders could run nodes or even full nodes to make a statistical point but please tell I am wrong that the miners, assuming that the majority can not reach consensus, are those with the last word. And this means trouble as the network would look for guilds and consequently centralize with time.

As laanwj says:" It can be useful but if you want to offer these kind of 'courtesy' services, they should be separate - either behind a service bit or such or a separate network like Electrum. Not mandatory extensions that the Bitcoin P2P network is stuck with forever."


In Reid Hoffman own words: "What’s even more remarkable about Bitcoin and the trustless trust architecture it introduces is that it’s open source, a technology that no one company controls to its advantage, a public good. This characteristic is foundational to Bitcoin’s value and success to date. But it also means that advances to Bitcoin Core, the software at the heart of the system, happen slowly. Volunteer developers work on the project on their own time. Changes are only implemented when consensus amongst Bitcoin’s development community is achieved.
Currently, the hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital that are being invested in Bitcoin companies go toward top-layer products and services, like Bitcoin wallets and Bitcoin exchanges. These products and services are extremely valuable, making it easy for individuals users to obtain and use bitcoins – and because they’re attracting so much investment, they’re improving rapidly.
To match this pace, Bitcoin Core needs investment and innovation, too. Right now, however, we’re mostly seeing developers with innovative ideas that could potentially broaden the core functionality of Bitcoin create their own forked cryptocurrencies. These alt.coins are inspired by Bitcoin’s approaches and code, but they operate independently from one another.
While these alt.coins create interesting new possibilities, Bitcoin is the platform where users, merchants, and entrepreneurs are congregating. It’s where the momentum is. That’s why it’s so important to promote development efforts that increase the power and flexibility of Bitcoin Core, and to do so in a way that keeps Bitcoin open, accessible to all users and developers, a public good.
In pursuit of this public good, I have personally invested in a start-up called Blockstream. After extensive discussion with my partners at Greylock, we decided this approach was the best way to achieve our long-term goals for the project. In this instance, the first objective is to increase the public good by strengthening the overall openness and functionality of the Bitcoin ecosystem through “sidechains” technology. Delivering returns to investors is an objective as well – but it’s a secondary objective."
Just as Red Hat, Canonical or Google contribute to Linux they also have to generate income. They then build and sell their products/services on top of that common public infrastructure.

OK, a whole bunch of things here.
If everyone except me ends up agreeing on a way to increase the block size, then I wouldn't have to collaborate on that, would I? It'd go ahead and happen anyway. Still, I think there's a risk is that Jeff and Gavin end up "agreeing" to a proposal that doesn't really make sense and they think is bad, just to try ensure something happens ..... but currently so little has happened that even this seems unlikely.
I don't recall saying I support BIP 100. I may have said if it happens anyway then XT would go along with it, obviously it'd have to, otherwise it wouldn't work properly anymore.
Workshop: right now neither me nor Gavin plan to attend Hong Kong.
Pulling together. I think the community has to get out of this notion that a vaguely defined community of experts hands decisions down from on high after a bunch of conferences or an IRC meeting or whatever. I realise why a lot of people like this idea but it's unhealthy. I wrote above about what can go wrong when groupthink takes hold. It's a very scary social failure mode, and yet isn't uncommon. Frankly right now I see a lot of the symptoms: the desire for social harmony through unanimous consensus, the attempts to minimise conflict at any cost, the 'illusion of invulnerability' etc.
Ironically, central banking has a lot of the same issues.
How can the dangers of groupthink be avoided? The wiki page has a few suggestions, but here are mine:
    For Core: replacing decision making through unanimity with a formal process for expressing and resolving disagreement, in a company this is usually a CEO, in a committee it can be a vote.
    Ensuring that for any decision that is made, the wider world has a clear and simple process for rejecting it. Any group must be able to be given "no" for an answer. In a country this is usually an election or a market. Gavin, myself and many others think a market for nodes which may cast different votes on changes to the block chain is the right way to do this.
    De-emphasising the role of (often self-proclaimed) intellectuals and experts, thus emphasising the judgement of work by results rather than the reputation of was involved. Deference to expertise is a means to an end with the end being correct results, but in the Bitcoin community it's too often become the end itself.
Whilst I understand the rationale that went into proposing two separate conferences to discuss scalability, and the idea that everyone always gets along with each other is lovely, I don't think endless talk in the pursuit of 100% agreement is healthy or productive. The first conference didn't produce any concrete deliverable e.g. a requirements document, so I am skeptical the second will be more effective. And I've made these views clear many times before.

There are problems with all governments and centralised institutions. But a government is innately more democratic then a private corporation.

Free voting choice is currently a convenient [illusion]( and those that control politicians are those that feed them empowered mainly by democratic apathy . But the system or playing field is democratic as long as the voters truly care and are able to resits the manufacturing of consent by what ever forces around us.

ETC doesn't have a foundation. Those working on ETC are Grothendieck team and ETCDev team + independent contributors. A lot of critical debates are going on between them. They often don't agree but that is actually a strength in our opinion. No idolatry and king commanding the network just as Bitcoin.
ETC has a temper proof ledger. ETH claims they applied a mulligan but a precedent has been set. ETH governance structure show a single point of failure. They have the power/influence to change the network in a flash. Mindblowing how fast the HF was justified and made. And yes, I agree that ETH is not going to bail out my bad investment or crappy code I wrote. I invested in TheDao but so did some very well capitalised and influential members of ETH.

In many ways, it's just like [21 Bitcoin Computer]( The main difference is that instead of having VC's (accredited investors) funding it now everyone can. Time will tell...

Atomic swaps bring interoperability between blockchains. Some see value or use cases for 2 different blockchains like Bitcoin and ETC complementing each other compared to Bitcoin and RSK. Any thoughts on this?

Why would they? They could say find a job or move on. Social contracts  are still existent. The problem is that comments like yours identify immigrants as bloodsucking financial parasites but in reality the majority only want to work and contribute towards their family and society. E.g. Are all American white supremacists?

Handing over your private keys - Sounds like a phishing scam! ;-)
But seriously, Keep your BTC in your wallets (those where you control your private key). Do not send them to ViaBTC! Wait for the BCC wallet and your private keys will have access to the same BCC amounts as your BTC wallet. You can then dump them or keep them. Warning: Be mindful of replay attacks!
Same as what happened with ETC and ETH. I support the immutable ETC chain and BTC Core chain especially since ETC had a valid reason for splitting. BCC on the other hand is a shitcoin!

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone home?
Come on, Come on, Come on, now,
I hear you're feeling down.
Well, I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again.
I'll need some information first.
Just the basic facts.
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I had a FEVER My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.
I have become comfortably numb.
Just a little pin prick.
There'll be no more aaaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good.
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go.
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown,
The dream is gone.
but I have become comfortably numb."

Knowing this ongoing fact, apathy can be seen as a vote of distrust in the Bitcoin foundation. This, as in nation states, can lead towards an extreme and vocal minority to pull the strings and decide the direction of the foundation and in parallel the state of the whole Bitcoin eco-system. 
Most agree that this is a weakness in all democratic systems but is there a common [declaration]( / [universal statement]( which will prevent drastic changes to the Bitcoin foundation? 
IMHO the "bitcoin foundation" is more accurately a "crypto currencies foundation" and can have some serious consequences to Bitcoin.

It's not an utopia. It's really an experiment in adaptation.
In a nutshell, you remove national borders and organically keep all other laws in place. You act locally and think globally. As soon as we realize that we live on one planet policies and different cultures will equalize. Diversity is key but this time without political boundaries. Just like natural ecosystems that converge with other ecosystems. The more diverse an eco system the more resilient it becomes. Working with constantly updated data points so that people can get real time information and base their decision on this data. 
American culture and history is based on immigrants and technically, in recent times it's a plutocracy. People are getting exhausted of the lies and distrust is growing. Blaming a minority or foreigner is a flat earth frame of mind. So yes, be bold and unafraid to try something new and if you emancipated yourself from mental slavery a paradigm shift will occur and be the basis of a new future and society. 
Evolve and adapt to new realities. I am ready for a world that is unafraid of itself.

Just as an example, [This paper]( successfully provided three methods of quantifying the value of free and open source hardware in order to provide economic justification for the support in FOSH development investment. The methods are rela-tively straight-forward to institute and are based on reliable freely-available data with minimal assumptions. The case study presented found millions of dollars of economic value from a relatively simple scientific device being released under open-licenses. This represents orders of magnitude increase in value from proprietary develop-ment. It is clear that FOSH development should be funded by organizations interested in maximizing return on  public investments particularly in technologies associated with science, medicine and education.

Logical flow. Remittances are usualy done from richer to poorer countries. So far Coinbase is only entering the developed countries. Being in Central America I can not wait for something like coinbase to arrive.  Hook up my local bank account and being able to exchange would be sweet as honey.

I can imagine that the patientslikeme site generates income by selling their database information &amp; The patients sharing their medical records only get access (not full access)  to share and learn from these experiences. 
With the blockchain and bitcoin we could collectively own our information and sell it to those who make money from it and share it with those institutions that use it for independent research. Sweet!

[Stolen?]( Satoshi found a way to open source his intellectual property and as a early adopter he got a considerable incentive by design. I would say that is truly believing in your product/service. That's one way to monetize your hard work.


The same reason why Bitcoin is open source? Trust? I am just trying to dissect the reasoning when and why open source make sense. Is it only at an APP level? Are different layers deciding this?
Open source could be considered the same as the commons. If I tip someone it is peer to peer. I believe tipping is a common infrastructure and not a service that charges for tipping.

Arguably, the car owns itself. Using a smart contract it tapped into crowd investment and is now offering transportation as a service.
