I have a new question that I asked another commenter above, but I'll copy and paste it here so you can answer as well because this is something that worries me: I just read that someone got screwed over at the 5500 dip because of the delay in his deposit clearing and now it is 7800. If I already have my money deposited into GDAX (ex. if I have $100 in my GDAX "USD Account"), will I ever have to worry about this happening to me? Did he only have this problem because he didn't already have money in that account and hence had to wait for the money to go into the account?

He got screwed in exactly the manner you said: he missed a huge opportunity. I understand what you're saying, but my question still stands: If I were to deposit $100 into my USD Account on GDAX, once it is cleared after 7-9 days (or whatever the time required to clear the funds is), can I start using it to instantly buy bitcoin at the price I see it? If I see a bitcoin selling price at $7000 and I wanted to spend $100 on it, will I immediately get the $7000 or will there be another delay of sorts?

Thanks for the info! I just want to confirm though that what I said was correct. If I deposit $100 into my USD Account on GDAX, it can be used immediately and I can buy bitcoin instantly at the price I see without worry of the price going up due to a wait (besides finding a seller willing to sell at my desired price)?

Correct me if what I'm saying doesn't make any sense or is wrong, but if I only ever "take," or do a near-instant trade by selling low/buying high, then it doesn't seem like I'll be battling bots that use the limit order system. Right?
