Deal is, people here just outright ignore the problem of PoW power consumption and the deep flaws of the lightning network.
@_date: 2019-07-21 06:27:41
I can assure you the one I have in mind was already was not only audited, but also chosen for PoS system based on its merits without a partnership or other bullshit like that.

Brute force produced by hardware from... a few companies.
That doesn't sound too convincing to me.
Not to mention it is unnecessary.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:11:11
Just no.
We already have better technology than Bitcoin for peer to peer trustless currency.
@_date: 2018-08-23 13:52:21
For those nutjobs... it is called Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:13:53
None of these forks solve what is the fundamental problem. (At least for me)
This fundamental problem is power consumption, I have only seen one coin (and its forks) do it well while eating less power.
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:56:28
Most, not all.

Bitcoin has one major flaw which cannot be rectified.
Mining is required for it to work which takes an insane amount of electricity for a relatively small number of transactions.
Sure, LN will solve the transaction side of things, but mining will remain as a huge power hog.
Some other cryptocurrencies do rectify this problem.
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:36:47
I'm I the only one who thinks other cryptocurrencies have their uses?
I don't include shitcoins in that.
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:37:40
Actually, that's a bit better than actual wealth.
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:06:20


A whole lot of people who care about global warming do care about this.


Bitcoin PoW alone takes as much power as the entire country of Austria, currently at ~73 TWh per year, this is only increasing.


Yes, the financial sector takes about 100 TWh per year, this is including ATMs, servers, transactions, stuff like that, do note they process many orders of magnitude more transactions.


There are 2 major problems with this.
1. If you did this, you would give those nutjobs at an argument why they have the real bitcoin, an argument I would actually kinda agree with.
2. It wouldn't solve the underlying problem, there would still be PoW to consume electricity.
The only solution to this is getting rid of PoW all together, which for bitcoin is simply impossible.

The deal about cryptocurrency... most work is done by computers, computers, as it stands right now, can't go on strike.

Check out the Banano discord, the coin is rather new.
It is based on NANO, so it has the same features.

1. I did not pull it out of my ass.
2. You pulled the million LN transactions out of your ass.
3. LN will never be fully accepted, just Segwit alone wasn't fully accepted.
4. Whole Bitcoin network **currently** consumes ~63.61 TW/h per year, and it is getting worse. The amount banks consume, including everything is estimated at ~100 TW/h per year.
@_date: 2019-06-01 10:50:22
I call bullshit on "hundrets of millions of transactions"
@_date: 2019-06-01 06:05:53


It is impossible to say exactly how much power each transaction has, we would have to know every machine on the network, but the estimate I found put it at [462 KW/h]( for a single transaction.


More hashing machines get connected as price goes up, simple.
@_date: 2019-04-24 05:28:41
Few coins seem to resist this, especially Monero and Nano.

Bitcoin Shit Version is over.
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:54:36
Still, 2^230 is way too much to just be guessing private keys.
@_date: 2019-01-24 12:24:02
There are more actual cryptocurrencies that use blockchain, namely Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero... there are more but 99% of them are shitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:45:22
To be fair, 30 000 USD is... a lot, especially in Poland.
In their shoes... I would at least consider it.
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:32:37
This is what happens when you bet everything on an obvious shitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:43:55
Sometimes it is easier to double it, no question about it.
But that is not the case with Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Shit Version doesn't solve the issue.

I'm not buying it until it has been stable/rising for at least a month after this dip.
We might be out of the biggest dip, but definitely, it is not over.

I'm OK with this.
Hackers now know not to mess with Binance.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:33:43
I honestly disagree with you.
I'd at least say that altcoins with unique hashing algorithm have some value. (LTC, ETH, XMR, ZEC...)

Honestly, the way Bitcoin does transactions is not environmentally friendly in the first place.
To clarify: Any cryptocurrency which needs mining is not environmentally friendly.
Fight me if you want.

No, Bitcoin is the worst way to transact in terms of how much power is needed per transaction.
And it is only getting worse.
Might be an unpopular opinion here.

My ass would be sore as well after holding the **shit version** in.
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:47:25
Bitcoin is hugely wasteful per transaction. Even banks are better at it.

Not fake, they hold most BCH/BSV/However is that shitcoin called. It, as expected, tanked.
