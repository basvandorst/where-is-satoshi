Yes one can defend themselves &amp; still not care about others opinions lol 
its a reddit post lol 
i am just responding does not mean i care about any of your opinions. it simply works like that. you can perceive it however youd like

clearly you dont know how to read. Majority !== Everyone but me. 
Google the word majority you fucking ass hat
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:17:58
because currently thats what Bitcoin is being indexed off of. because the majority of the world thinks fiat currency is sound money. so at the moment that is what Bitcoin is being indexed off of. 
and you "understand finance". jesus
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:16:56
I can have 1000 comments and still not care what you think. I can respond without caring about your opinion. It's not hard lol the definition for care doesn't even imply defending one self. Attach importance. Your opinion is not important to me therefore I do not care. Are you fucking retarded?
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:58:13
I can respond without caring what people think? that's usually what I do is respond. doesnt mean i give a fuck lol
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:25:31
Lol I have lost 0 money due to price decrease in Crypto. aside from the 129 Bitcoin I've gotten hacked/lost that is the only loss.
Other than that I'm still up a couple hundred grand.

simply index bitcoin off something that has intrinsic value as how they did with the USD &amp; Gold before the USD became nothing but paper people give value to. Nothing backs FIAT. Stop playing stupid. 
If you think thats the BIGGEST problem with Bitcoin then you are either  shill or a dumbfuck.

Aside from it being Bitcoin on Steroids + HGH, I really like the dev team aside from all the FUD that is thrown around. Just keep in mind Rynomaster was offered to work for Darkcoin aka DigitalCash aka DASH back when ShadowCash was making a huge run &amp; Rynomaster turned down the offer to build his own non scam coin. Facts. Darkcoin was the biggest ninja launch premine in alt coin history.

@_date: 2017-04-18 13:51:09
I didn't know that I breached there TOS. I am not running a Bitcoin exchange. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 14:15:43
Because that's what happened. Why can people send money via Venmo &amp; attach a comment saying "Crack" "Dick sucked" etc. &amp; still have their accounts in good standing? 
Isn't that illegal business? Nonetheless business. 
Still don't understand the difference. But I learned my lesson. Fuck PayPal &amp; fuck Venmo. Use Bitcoin. No one can freeze your assets or terminate your account because of vague gray area TOS.
@_date: 2017-04-18 17:03:54
I see I see. Thanks for the info, instead of just flaming me saying me I am a retard. 
I am a retard for not reading through there TOS I was just confused as to why certain transactions were allowed with illegal comments attached but a simple Bitcoin transaction is violating. Seems odd but those are the rules. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-04-18 03:37:14
That's weird. I have seen plenty of public transactions with comments referring to drugs , sex , illegal activities , etc. yet their accounts are in good standing. 
Also how can someone sell tickets to a sports game without getting their account terminated. Is that not the same thing? 
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:49:49
I still truly don't see the difference. They act like I own a Bitcoin exchange. This was my first transaction I was going to do but ...yeah
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:48:15
I had some left over bitcoin I was selling for to a friend which I didn't see for a profit? This is the only transaction I've done. 
I understand your point but that is not what I was doing.
@_date: 2017-04-19 14:16:32

Be patient. Do not buy into the All Time Highs. Never sell at a loss. You never lose money until you sell at a loss. 
Here are some projects to look into : 
I was that idiot that got 55,000 shadowcash hacked on Bitcointalk....&amp; for some reason I still invested a couple Bitcoin into Particl.

I remember people legitimate posted the suicide prevention hotline after gox. Mark you bastard.
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:20:15
thats a good 380,107 Bitcoin volume @ ~$500. Why &amp; how would someone, or a group of people fake that volume. 
MT. Gox inflated/had fake volume as far as I know, but this is after mt gox.
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:05:28
The volume in September 2016 is massive while the price remained around the ~$500 range, yet the current volume is a fraction of what the September 2016 volume was yet the price is 5x greater.

380,107 Bitcoin worth of fake volume? Can this be verified anywhere?
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:10:51
By fake volume do you mean the same people buy /selling into their own buy / sell walls? 
And I have never came across a trading platform with 0 fees. Curious where you got this information from.

My thoughts exactly. I've been mining since ~2011 until my butterfly labs 30gh/s asic miner became a paperweight, &amp; I have never seen this with any crypto currency yet. All time high after all time highs. Then you look at the top mining pools and 46.1% of the hashrate is coming out of China. ��

But when GOX was inflating the shit out of their supply &amp; creating Gox Coins no other reputable exchanges adjusted their price to that of Gox. 
Gox was a shit show. If this volume is all fake, why is it even posted? I am confused.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:10:03
of course i rap this shit full blast atleast 1337 times a day
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:11:34
I for one bought 20 Bitcoin when it hit $198 after gox. I don't think it was all fake? That's fair to say?
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:05:07
Wait, so this just came to mind. This is a graph from BitcoinWisdom pulled from the Bitstamp exchange. How does a chinese exchange correlate with Bitstamp.  
Did no exchange know about these trading bots from china with 0 fee? Why would Bitstamp feel pressured to increase their price if the majority of the volume was fake? Does that mean Bitstamp also posted fake volume on their graph?
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:22:26
