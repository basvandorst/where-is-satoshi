Never used eBay and bid a penny over a round number? Exact same principle.

Seems like pretty desperate efforts to associate 'Kevin' with the hackers, given the number of users who use the site it's absolutely believable that he logged in around the same time completely coincidentally. He's a lucky opportunist, nothing more.
How about MtGox show everyone else who logged in within that same *hour*? Those logs prove nothing.


Somehow? It's obvious to anyone with a braincell that a market crash that rapid is likely a blip, and a perfect chance to buy cheap.
This situation, and MtGox's handling of it, have exposed them as the under-experienced incompetents they are. They should take the vast amounts of money they've made and close up shop.

Well, now I'm glad I used a unique random letter password.
Lesson learned to set up a junk email address for sites I'm suspicious of.

No, [they didn't](
And nowhere is there any evidence of him placing the order before it happened, despite the fact that it would be incredibly easy for Magicaltux to prove.
@_date: 2011-06-21 07:31:30
Where does it say that? 
@_date: 2011-06-21 18:43:17
Yes, and so did hundreds of other people, unless we're to believe he was literally the only person to log in at that time.
Again, at no point does Magicaltux actually claim he put the buy order in *before* they started the mass sell off.
Re-read it:


To which magicaltux replies:


The only evidence he's presenting us is that Kevin logged in after the hackers did (so what?) and that he placed the order. He does not say that he placed the order before the sell off began, and if that's what he *is* claiming he could quite easily post logs of when the order was placed. But he isn't, he's implying it, and letting people believe it.
@_date: 2011-06-21 18:02:13
Kevin admits to exactly that, he logged in, saw the market was going down, and placed a big order.
It's linking that to the hackers that has absolutely no basis other than claiming it and letting people put two and two together to make five.
Like all conspiracy theories this can be undone with a very simple question: There was no need to place the order when he did, he could have done it weeks in advance. If he had prior knowledge why would he do it as shit was going down?
@_date: 2011-06-22 10:08:33
I'm amazed so many people jumped on the guy, considering there was *absolutely no evidence whatsoever* linking him to the hackers.
@_date: 2011-06-21 17:39:31
It still doesn't say he placed the order immediately after logging in.

How can you tell if it's salted? Curious to know if mine was.
@_date: 2011-06-22 11:52:56
I'd don't even find it particularly suspicious, if I'd logged in at the right time and had some money in my account I would have tried to do the exact same thing.
