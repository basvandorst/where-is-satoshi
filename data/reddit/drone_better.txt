My guess is $8000. As infrastructure for transactions increases, it will become more stable, especially with the Lightning Network allowing for more transactions/second. It will rise again, eventually. Just hold out now. (I hope this doesn't come back to haunt me.)

No, for a Satoshi (10^(-8) Bitcoins) to be worth one Euro-cent, it would have to be worth 10^(8-2)=€1,000,000, or $1,127,100.

I'm not Satoshi, but I'd probably say that we should somehow stop electricity consumption from getting too high. According to 3blue1brown's [excellent video]( more mining speed doesn't change anything about Bitcoin itself, it just uses extra electricity and harms the planet.
@_date: 2019-08-31 00:36:32
Yes. But one aspect of Bitcoin is that the total amount of money spent mining is money put into Bitcoin's value, while the total value dictates the money put into mining. This isn't a 1:1 connection, though, and no-one would be worse-off if we agreed to half the total amount of Bitcoin mined forever, we'd have more money and electricity to spend on other, more important things than magical internet money.

Wait. Is this normal? I thought this was unique to me, since one tube sending fluids to one testicle hadn't closed up when it should have, leading to it being swollen. It got very big, and in the aftermath of the operation I had, the previously swollen one was much further down than the regular one. I think they were pretty much the same altitude before, and I assumed it was a rare edge-case because it was swollen previously.

@_date: 2019-08-31 03:13:18
But from what I understand, we're already past maximum transaction capacity, because the Lightning Network is a method of expanding this capacity. I don't think we'd have any empty or sparsely populated blocks.

It's not as bad as 2017, though.
@_date: 2019-08-31 02:37:19
Actually, though, wouldn't doubling the transactions/block just half the comparative reward for miners? I know changing the time per block wouldn't change anything, because the difficulty would just change to match it, but wouldn't doubling transactions/block half the reward for miners/Bitcoin usage? Or am I missing something here?

Plot twist: Craig Federighi created Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-31 02:13:00
That's true, but only in the sense that it would be easy for hackers to pretend to have sudden bursts in mining speed, which the number of required 0s (at the beginning of the hash of the last block plus a random 256-bit string) would change to match your increased amount. This would let you prioritise and exclude transactions (which is what happens when someone gets over 50% of the total mining capacity), but not impersonate anyone. And I'm not sure what the current largest miner's % dominance is, bit it's nowhere near 25%, so I don't think there's any risk.

There are many studies linking ketamine usage to cardiovascular disease. This is just a single example.


I agree with you on the lack-of-consent issue, but on the other side of the coin, when someone gives you some drugs at a party and you're already drunk, you don't know what you're getting into, and it could be argued that being intoxicated means you're not giving consent. Hopefully, the majority of sexually exploited men, women and children can be rescued and can go back to living normal lives. The problem with drug use is that you're not bound to it by a person, who can be taken away and imprisoned, but by an addiction, which can be much harder to break.


I'm not 'into' child pornography or human trafficking, I just think you're underestimating the horrific effects of drugs.
If you're going to try attacking the person, not the argument, and [bringing up this conversation in an unrelated comment]( I'm going to quote you. You said that [people concerned about drugs in 2019 are 'stuck']( in their ways, and aren't going to be changed. You're not just saying 'cannabis', which is becoming legalised in the US, but specifically the illegal drugs that people resort to using cash and Bitcoin to pay for, in order to avoid their transactions being tracked. There's a reason for this, and there's a reason for their illegality. You seem to have a very immature view of "drugs good, 'anyone still concerned with drugs in 2019 isn't going to be swayed'".
All in all, though, they're both extremely bad, and our argument is semantic.
@_date: 2019-12-08 14:51:43
Human trafficking and child pornography are bad, but at the end of the day, the victims can be rescued from these situations with minimal physical damage, if mental damage. Even alcohol can be worse, in the eventual outcome. I've seen homeless people coughing up blood and phlegm on the streets before. Then there are the drugs you're referring to, that are illegal for a reason. r/LegoYoda made jokes about ketamine, which were funny and ironic, but one of my friends is now incapable of experiencing excitement due to a ketamine-related heart condition. Then, there's krokodil, which melts your skin off. How are the other two, in any way, more severe?

Hypothetically, if they did and someone else discovered that RSA is reversible and published their method, they'd have everything silenced and wiped, and probably either inducted into a government or killed, because the governments would want us to believe it's secure so that we're less careful about what we send online.

Okay. I think I was probably wrong. Cryptography looks like it's secure, at least against guessing and checking at random with Gigagalactic Supercomputers.

If cloud computing becomes 30 times more powerful, it won't be able to perform 2^256 hashes. If it does, we can move over to 4096-bit computing long before then. Every additional bit makes it linearly more difficult to compute for us (which is negligible), and exponentially more difficult for traditional computers to hack. Use the video's knowledge, I beg you.
Quantum computers will probably lead to new algorithms that have this same property, but for quantum computers instead of traditional ones. But why do you think it will only take '60 or so years'? !RemindMe 60 years.
