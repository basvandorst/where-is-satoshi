It feels strange to have a portfolio of all equal parts of each crypto. Why not use a “market cap” portfolio (I know market capitalization has its own issues) or a mean-variance optimized portfolio? The analysis is pretty technical but the portfolio selection method seems lacking.

Only BCH and BTG can be accessed right now right? Is there any word when any other coin can be accessed?

When will bch/btc trading start on Gdax?

I was wondering the same thing. There has got to be a reason they pulled the pug on the BTC/BCH trading earlier this month.

What does JP Morgan do with the money “on deposit”.  Seems like they have the opportunity to do what they want and have another avenue to employ “Fractional Reserving”.

how does this work? what does this do compared to a wallet? does it just store the keys for you or is it a wallet as well.

What is the point of creating a fork? If you truly believed your idea/tech was better why not start a entirely new chain? That is the part I don’t understand. All these fork coins and airdrops seem like scams to give current holders more coins and wealth.

Isn’t there a bch fork upcoming? They prob planned a pump for the same time.

Has any of the mt Gox bch been sold yet? Their sale of btc put a big hit on the btc markets a while back. I would think a bch sale would be a even larger hit in that smaller market.
