Personally, I think that Bitcoin/Block-chain was developed by the same central bankers that currently run the system. I think that they knew their system was always designed to eventually fail and Bitcoin was introduced as a shiny new alternative to move their money and keep the people of the world under their thumb, but in a new, digital way. It's a conspiracy theory I know, but these bastards play for keeps and I really doubt that they would let something like Bitcoin take off without already having had control of it. Plus, nobody knows who created it, which is exactly their style. Nice n shady. Thoughts?

The way that I always understood it the central banks basically create currency out of thin air and lend it to countries at interest. At times it's been backed by gold and or silver, and other times it hasn't. Either way the economy seems to have fairly regular ebbs and flows and every 40 years or so the system seems to take a big dump, go into depression and then continue the cycle. Keep in mind, I'm a tradesman, not a financial guru, so my understanding about all of this stuff is clearly limited at best.

Ah okay that makes sense

How about the creation of BTC though? I mean doing the algorithms to create them, could it be the central banks that can profit off of that part?  I'm genuinely curious, this stuff fascinates me

Sell off a few and buy physical gold, silver and a safe. If the power grid goes down for whatever reason you'll be glad to have it. Plus silver is completely undervalued right now so it's a good investment anyways
