I loan you 1 btc today, and I expect 1.2 btc a year from now.  20% interest rate.  People simply wont take out as much money in a loan.  Homes will be payed with 50-80 or even 100% down and the rest would be reasonable amounts.  Lenders would be much more defensive and discerning leading to a more efficient economy with drastically lower malinvestments, bubbles and crashes.

"Bist du ein berliner?" translates to "Are you a Berliner?" where ein Berliner references a jelly donut found in [Germany](  In essence you're asking if I am a jelly donut! (I am not)
The correct translation would be "Bist du Berliner?" which would mean "are you from (or do you live in) berlin?"  
In the same context, "Wir sind eine bitcoiners" would mean "We are a bitcoiners" where bitcoiners would reference some physical thing (whatever it may be).  
What you're looking for would be "Wir sind Bitcoiners" which would mean "we are bitcoiners" in reference to your origin/state of being in a location.  It doesn't translate well, but this would be better and more understanding as a portmanteau than wir sind eine bitcoiners.  
This is the same German language nuance that JFK messed up during his famous speech in Berlin ("Ich bin ein Berliner").  If you listen to the speech you can hear some chuckles in the crowd when he first says it.

The good thing with bitcoin, is due to their lack of centralized control and strict monetary supply, every time someone spends bitcoins, they truly trickle down.  Their (discerning) spending results in someone elses income that goes to wages, capital investment and further expands the economy and distributes the coins efficiently.  
Unlike today where "trickle down" means "we get the money first from the press, spend it at it's current purchasing power before it has a chance to effect the supply and lowering the real value."

This is mainly because since they stopped allowing bitcoin withdrawals people see cash transfers as an easier way to get money out.  
They're super slow with cash withdrawals, but I do believe they're still going through.  They're not, however, allowing btc transactions.  
If I have btc on that exchange, I would probably sell them no matter what the price and try to get a cash transfer to my bank account.  If the rumors are true that they're short BTC, than those who don't get out are left with the bag.

The big question is: How much BTC did they lose, and can they satisfy all BTC accounts?  
My guess is someone took them to town using this exploit and they have less BTC than deposits.  They're insolvent and essentially bankrupt.  This press release is a big show, and probably an attempt at manipulating the market to a lower price so they can buy coins back cheap and hopefully cover their above stated shortfalls.  
This is supported by the fact that they're graciously allowing people to sell their coins for goxbux and still withdraw cash.  They're trying to get cheap coins to cover what they lost.  
This is all speculation BTW!

Not to mention that savings, and not debt, would be the reservoir from which entrepreneurship draws.  This empowers those who save their wages and not those who have the easiest access to capital and debt (banks).  
Banks traditionally were not very glorious positions to work.  They used to be as normal as the shoe cobbler down the street (hyperbole).  It wasn't until the 70s and really, the 80s when wall street and traders started to become the big earners in the employment market.  This starts sapping the brightest minds from productive innovative positions like STEM careers as they chase those inflated earnings that benefit from the status quo more.

Lending is more important in an economy based on inflation.  
Savings is more important in an economy based on deflation.  
This is because people who lend stay ahead of the inflation curve.  People's savings in a deflationary economy acts as the source for capital purchases and protects the labor (savings) of the masses.  
Incentives is an important issue when comparing the two, in broad senses.  The incentive to save and be fickle with your money in a deflationary currency empowers the many and ultimately leads to a robust, efficient economy.  Incentives in an inflationary economy leads to debt for the many and "infinite," rampant capital purchases by those ahead of the inflationary curve, or the few.  The few include banks that control the value, volume and throughput of money.  They receive new money with the (higher) value of old money and acquire capital before the many can even step into the game.  By the time the many are involved, the purchasing power has decreased and resulted in lower standards of living for the many.  
Saving is not economically neutral.  Savings acts as the reserves from which capital is acquired.  In a deflationary environment that capital must achieve a certain level of efficiency in order for it to be worth while to discerning actors with savings.  This acts as a natural counter to the basic human urge of greed and prevents malinvestment.  
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:14:51
This also acts to incentivize banks to be more conservative and defensive over who they lend to.  It also incentivizes comsumers to actually save in order to purchase big ticket items.  If the above scenario was real, gone would be the days of 0 down, or even 5%-20% down.  People would need 50% or more to put down on a new home.  This wouldn't be too hard of an issue because the labor of the consumer would be preserved, and in fact grow, through their savings.  It acts to handcuff greed and punish those who over extend and prevent malinvestments.  
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:22:24
If your income is 1btc a month you should not be taking out a 400btc loan.  In a deflationary environment people will rely less on loans and more on savings.  That was my point, and it still stands.  
People back in the early 1900s never took out huge loans for houses.  They were almost always paid for from savings from wages.  Banks weren't even that big back then because of this exact reason.  They didn't loan out money as much as they do now.  
This just so happened to be the time the US saw the most rapid growth in quality of life in human history.  The people who made huge money did so, initially, by providing massive boosts to quality of life to the populace.  Trains, Oil for lighting, Automobiles, Oil for vehicles, Iron working, ect.  People nowadays get rich by fucking around with finances and pushing paper around so as to screw the many to centralize money and power for the few.

Think it's a coincidence that paypal announced their use of bitcoin today?  
Apple is moving into paypal's territory.  How do they get the upper hand?  By using a system that provides less friction for everyone 
Apple is just adopting the old system and adding a layer on top of it.  As I understand apple pay, it goes consumer &gt; apple &gt; bank &gt; merchant.  
Paypal can undercut this by going consumer &gt; paypal (as mediator: think escrow and other services) &gt; merchant.  
If paypal can end up being the bitcoin killer app, they can take the wind out from apple pay.  Apple pay automatically has huge adoption though...an obvious response from google would be something similar, as they have much larger market share.

It's a scarce resource that needs to be priced as such.  In a free market there needs to be price discovery and people need to account for the time value of money.

A deflationary spiral is nearly completely mitigated by bitcoins infinite fungibility.  No one wants to spend their coins?  It would just mean that prices adjust to reflect that.  There will always be enough liquidity for transaction to occur, however.  I believe a deflationary spiral is a fallacy especially in the eyes of bitcoins.  People need to eat, live, sleep, work, entertain and socialize, have outlets for creativity...there will always be a base demand for "essential" goods that improve our lives.  In the world we live in now, the system is setup to punish those who spend (debt) and punish more harshly those who save (inflation).  It's setup to funnel money into the coffers of more and more centralized players who then enact control over the bodies that are setup to represent the people.  Bitcoins puts the power of choice back in the hands of the people.  You chose to spend money when a service or product meets your quality standards.  This will make companies work harder to produce better products with more efficiency.

They don't.  They dodge the income tax.  Income is taxed progressively in tiers which can add up to (or more than) 40% of your income.  The super rich get paid in stocks, options, and capital.  They then proceed to take advantage of the system they've molded to give them the best return, while protecting as much as possible in tax havens.  Some do outright criminal actions by keeping cash/assets offshore.
I'm by no means an expert, but the majority of a rich persons' estate is aimed towards avoiding as much tax as possible with their huge capital and assets, while joe-schmo struggles as a huge fraction of their income is taken away by the income tax and sales tax machine.

It's important to realize that if an asset is undervalued, people would rather hold while it reaches it's proper value before they spend.  This is perfectly natural in a free market and an important part of describing the collective valuation of said asset.  I'm not spending my bitcoins because I know how rare they are, how revolutionary they are, and how useful they are.  Considering the price at this point, I'm not comfortable with parting ways with any of them.  If the price spikes up to a more favorable value, it will make me more comfortable with my position to start spending fractions of a coin. 
For far too long we have had an economy based on spending, and keyensian theory.  An unadulterated savings and spending equilibrium is what makes bitcoins so attractive.  There is no third party capable of manipulating the rates for savings which in turn makes savings look less attractive, and people spend more.  Yes, we want economic activity by people spending their bitcoins, but only if it's at a market rate.  We can't force people to spend, that removes the romance of bitcoins.  We want people to spend as they see fit.

Get that keynesian bullshit out of here.  The demand is real.  The coins that sit there are doing so for a reason.  It's called savings.  When the true market price is found and stability sets in, people who saved will be more willing to spend a fraction of their holdings.   At this point it will also beget investments FROM those savings leading to true and proper economic growth.

Hoarding is a direct result of the market price not reflecting the true perceived value.  If coins were million bucks a piece, and that correlated to 1 million dollars worth of stuff in today's dollars, you can guarantee the hoarding would diminish. What we want is equilibrium between saving and spending. In unfettered traditional markets that equilibrium is reflected in the interest rates for savings.  For bitcoins?  The price acts as that indicator.  Keep in mind, during the inflationary period with the ability to mine coins, the price is constantly being depressed.  
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:25:04
Wrong. For bitcoins to succeed, use them as you see fit. If you want to save?  Save.  If you need to buy something, spend.  A true price, the function of saving vs spending, will only be found if people are free to do as they please. Frivolous spending is an artifact of the current economics paradigm.

Savings and spending are balanced in a healthy, unmanipulated economy. Interest rates tend to be the road sign for this. High savings begets low interest rates which beget capital investment through loans. This is assuming full reserve banking. With bitcoins were all our own bankers at this point. The price of bitcoins is acting as the roadsign. When it gets high enough, the savers will be more willing to spend the smaller denominations for everyday expenditures.  This due to the demand for "savings" is higher then those actual savings.

If you sell and buy back all within an exchange, you made what's called a taxable event.  You will be hit with long term capital gains tax obligation on any profit every time you sell back into usd, depending on the length of time you held the asset for (in this case bitcoins). 
Since you've held them for 3 years, and would realize essentially 99.99% profit, you would owe uncle Sam $9k on $50k profit assuming 18% long term capital gains.  It could be slightly higher or lower depending on some variables.  
Keep in mind this is due the instant you turn those coins into USD on an exchange.  If you didn't claim the profit and got audited, I feel bad for you son.  
My suggestion?  If you believe in bitcoins, let it ride.  Its either going to be astronomically more valuable in the future, or worth nothing. That's the determination you need to make.  Don't try to time the market. Believe in the fundamentals.  If you don't?  Get out, but don't forget to pay uncle Sam. They will get the money one way or another.  Its the nature of the beast.  
You have a chance to participate in a paradigm shift on a global scale that's never been seen before, for the low low price of 50 bucks. If that doesn't intrigue, sell. Do not try to day trade. Do not try to time the market. That's all noise in the face of the fundamental flaws or benefits bitcoins has to offer, depending on your view.  Once again its up to you and only you what to do with the money.

Bitcoin is money and currency at the same time. Its a means of value transfer and preservation at the same time.

The incentive to invest in an inflationary economy causes massive malinvestments, ie housing bubble, tech bubble, ect.

We all need to recognize that he has massive capital tied up in distributing and holding PMs.  We can't fault him for being cautious and defensive of that capital when up till bitcoin's inception the closest thing was those PMs.  While I'm sure most of us respect him for his economic views because they're congruent with bitcoin's design, and he does pay tribute to that, it will take time for him to come around, but I'm sure it'll happen.

This is more of a "basics of bitcoin economic philosophy" than it is of bitcoin as a protocol.  No discussion of cryptographic private and public keys, block chain or how the network actually works.

I would hold till tax issues are determined.

µB = 1/1,000,000 B
1.00 µB = 1 microbit with two places for satoshis.  1.01 = "1 microbit and 1 satoshi."
"I own half a bitcoin which = 500,000 µB"
"I own fifty thousand µB and 20 satoshi (50,000.20)"
Just go straight to microbits using satoshi as the "cents."  If we need to expand the divisibility in the future then go to nanobitcoin with 2 decimel places for satoshi.  In other words satoshi will always be the smallest 2 units of account.  It's just nomenclature.  
0.000,000,000,120,50 B = 120.50 nB = "One hundred twenty nanobit and fifty satoshi"

I think mining is another gray area that fincen needs to address. I would imagine as long ad you hold the coins for longer than a year you still owe capital gains. Those taxes go into effect the second you sell the coins, no matter what you do with them.

Depending on your interest rates that may have been a poor decision, financially.  I have $40k in student loans at 3%, it will take me 25 years, but I will never pay more than I need to.  I'll let the depreciating value of the dollar work for me.  This just means I have more fiat to buy bitcoins, whiskey and cigars with.
