Almost all of the lawyers in China speak English.  It is highly likely this lawyer never existed.  Probably pretended by Star.  Now, that is not usual business practice.

I don't think you have to worry about the people reading this thread.  I am more worried about the people who are not reading this thread.  They are left holding the bags.  Those poor suckers in China who couldn't get to reddit without a VPN.
Faking to be a lawyer is a far more serious offense than faking a contract.  I think this CEO will end up in jail the minute he steps outside of China.
OKCoin goes uninternational...  Nice move to save $20k.

You would make a much better CEO than the one currently at OKC.

Am I missing something? if I read v8 correctly, even with that, OKCoin is seriously violating its end of the bargain.  What are they trying to prove? They are dis-honest people who don't honor contracts in both cases?
They are already $20,000 late in payments to Roger, which lead to this whole show.  Now they are saying they will pay $20,000 to someone else to prove v8 is real and not pay Roger?  WTF?  Who is going to believe them?

Here, Reddit, my living room, and the whole world is the jurisdiction.  Digital signatures are much much harder to fake than a traditional one.
