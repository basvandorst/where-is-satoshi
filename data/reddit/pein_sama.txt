For example to make one upgrade instead of two.
Other reason is that native addresses give more benefit in terms of tx size then P2SH wrapped.
Third reason is - that's not only bech32. Core's command line interface for segwit is not fully functional either.
Core has developed a half-baked solution and then its fanboys bash companies for not using it.

Quite the opposite. LN encourages using a single address and reliance on third party (ex. a hub compromised by CIA) to process your payments.

It scales more than twice as bad as a simple bitcoin transaction because a single swap incorporates 2 transactions (4 if you consider the other chain also) that are also larger than a standard transaction.

It's not misplaced. It's talking about a **spike** after Coinbase is back, not the **dip** when it's offline. And the dip is not impressive either. This part of the chart really is not significantly different than any other. I doubt If I removed marks on axis you would still be able to point the Coinbase there.

The title contains the answer why.


Giants move slowly. That's that simple. I was working in projects where making a feature was taking months when it was obvious it could be done in a week if that was a small startup. And this is normal.

@_date: 2018-01-13 16:59:16
As said elsewhere - it's not 2 hours. It an entire day. It's even before Coinbase went down. And considering this wall has tiny tx fees it's not realted to coinbase activity but rather is just rebroadcasting of the transactions that expired after their 2 weeks of mempool limbo.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:54:44
Core is eager to do "clever" stuff, but not so much with "boring but necessary" stuff.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:11:19
Thanks for this explanation, it nicely reiterates all that I said but maybe wasn't clear enough without this red bar drawn.
However, there is still an issue with your interpretation. 
You assume that we can make a linear regression from the downtime period. This is not true for several reasons. We have just an observation when the huge part of the ecosystem simply vanishes. The impact of Coinbase would decrease to some extent if they implemented batching but not vanish. How much? You don't know this. Also, *ceteris paribus* obviously doesn't apply here. People are outpriced of Bitcoin. There are coins that can't move at all, there are people not willing to transact until fees drops to some acceptable for them level. Vanishing Coinbase can just make those people jump in again and become the new source of fee pressure. Now look around. There is a lot of other as steep downtrends and even steeper ones on the chart despite Coinbase running fine then. That means that the **Coinbase traffic is smaller than total traffic variance.** What I'm trying to say all the time is that people are exaggerating the Coinbase impact in a rage that resembles a witch hunt.
This is troubling. Let's compare it to what happened on Ethereum with Cryptokitties. Eth chocked. What was the general reaction of the community? It was a recognition. Of course there were people frustrated at Cryptokitties, but most people understand that it's a manifestation of Eth scalability limitations rather than kitties fault. This is a healthy community focused on improvements and humble enough to admit own failures.
Meanwhile, what is this community focused on? Blaming. Shaming. Spamming customer support. Shitty memes with more blaming and shaming. Granted, some LN stuff also. And who are you blaming today? A biggest gate to Bitcoin for newcomers. For what? For being too big. There is simply no capability here to admit failure. Instead, one by one, you label greatest Bitcoin pioneers your enemies.

This is absolutely false. Nodes are safe to fail. Nothing big happens if your node goes down. It happens all the time and it is expected to happen. This is not the case for lightning node because of the weak security model. Being offline allows your money to be stolen. Running an LN hub requires highly robust, stable system. In practice - a datacenter.

You're not seeng my point. Sure, the govt can put money into running nodes. For what? They can also put money into other cryptographic proofs that just don't waste electricity on mining. The mining is a cost of trustlessness. If it's just the govt who's running the nodes - what's the point of that design? You still have to trust govt. And if anyone can run node, without providing the lawful motivation, the 51% attack is just a matter of time.
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:35:31
My main concern is: how the system will encourage to run nodes. In Bitcoin we have simple financial benefit - mining = earning BTC. What benefit does mining in e-votings brings? Obviously, it can't be earning e-voting tokens as it simply would mean richer people can have more votes because they can buy more GH/s. That's oligarchy, not democracy. As we can see in BTC - there is an endless hashrate race requiring you to invest more and more into the mining equipment. Who could invest money just to 'run democracy engine' and no direct benefit?

Your procedure lacks: 0) Calculate risks and security costs. Make sure that risk is significantly higher than cost.

It is not. There is a marginal cost of securing a transaction. Miners - when competing with each other - will asymptotically approach that market-driven limit and simply not include tx below the marginal cost. No artificial limit is necessary for this.

Don't treat bitcoin as yet another investment instrument. If you want to get into bitcoin, first understand it. I mean deep understanding of reasons it exists at all.

Then you can make your own decision.

"to block SegWit" is a loaded statement assuming some malicious minority acting against the community. Pools you mentioned are already a majority. SegWit just doesn't have as much support as Blockstream wishes.

Let's straighten up a misconception about forking, that "replay protection" slogan contains.
Bitcoin have several properties that makes the chain split difficult. It will be a mystery forever whether they have been foresaw by Satoshi or they are accidental, but they do exist. They make the minory chain in case of the fork likely to die.
First is the slow difficulty adjustment occurring in periods measured by block count. This causes the minority chain to starve for months with unadjusted difficulty, contrary to majority chain that has performance degraded lighter and for a shorter period of time. There is a significant usability disproportion that encourage people to abandon minority chain completely. This is why Bitcoin Cash had to introduce EDA in order to survive.
Another one is an ability to do the change by a softfork. This prevents chain split completely because legacy nodes are not even aware of the change. This is the strongest way to coerce the change on the network. This is why Bitcoin Cash needed a hardfork to remain unaffected by SegWit.
And now we have replay attack. Because transactions are compatible across forks the same transaction propagates in both networks making the minority chain kind of "synchronized" with majority chain, making it a lagging, inexact copy of the majority chain. This is why Bitcoin Cash introduced tx format change (aka relay protection) as a part of the hardfork.
So, now the difficult question: why didn't SegWit contain replay protection? Sounds like a stupid question, but... For the same reason 2x didn't. For the same reason it's a SoftFork rather than hardfork in the first place. Because both were considered an upgrade of the chain rather than a community divorce. SegWit achieved this concept by the strongest mean of coercion - tricking the old nodes that nothing have changed. 2x as being a hardfork can't do that but still have soft (heh) means of killing the minority chain - not by preventing it completely but by making it unusable. So the difference between softfork and a hardfork is like between using a condom (preventing conception of the forked lifechain) and a spiral (starving the forked lifechain). The final outcome is similar - the minority opposing the change is forced to perform some countermeasures on their own. This is how Bitcoin Cash was born and this is how some Bitcoin Core would be born if 2x didn't back off.
If you consider the "lack of replay protection" an attack then so is the softfork. Is you consider SegWit an upgrade, then so is 2x. If you consider 2x an attack then so is SegWit.
Or have an honesty to say the change you just like is an upgrade and the change you just don't like is an attack.

Or people are genuinely disillusioned about Bitcoin's future and move away to something that actually scales today, not in 2 years if ever.

It work as OP describes only for non contentious upgrades, like CSV. If the change is contentious, BIP9 inevitably becomes a voting tool because it simply has that power.

How is asicboost different to other benefits like:
* residing in a country with subsidized electricity
* using GPU over CPU
* using ASIC over GPU
* having a solar panel
* or hydroelectric power plant
Every point of that list is affected with at least several patents or other government influence.

"evil miners", "good miners" - what a silly division showing complete lack of understanding of the bitcoin foundations. Bitcoin is based on miners' greed. If you have to put moral categories onto that then it's a failed project already.

Out of ass 4x discount.
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:52:11
Or there are other, legitimate objections against SegWit that this community refuses to admit. Please, re-read them. Asicboost is an easy "explanation" of presumed "evilness" of miners for conspiracy theorists.

Let me rephrase: how is your broad definition useful?
@_date: 2016-09-18 21:44:05
I think the opposite. Too broad definitions often mean little understanding. It's actually a great harm for people thinking they're investing in, ex. house they're buying, when it's rather consumption.

I'm afraid you misread or ignore the very last sentence in the whitepaper:


Also, chapter 4 states:


That "also" shows that decision making is seen as something separate to timestamping transactions, which is blockchain's primary job, yet still something to be there.

He apparently supports a hardfork to 1.44 MB blocks.

2. Internet polls consensus

Because of SegWit. Bitcon Cash was an emergency hardfork made to prevent coersion of Segwit on entire community.
So, ironically, SegWit failed at it most praised 'benefit' of not causing the split of blockchain.

What is preventing you from buying an ASIC the same way you could buy a CPU?

TX fee is implemented simply as an imballance between sum of tx inputs and outputs. When you find a block, you gets 25 + all of that imballances.
@_date: 2015-11-29 14:33:51
So what? From the user perspective it really doesn't matter why the transaction was refused by the POS. RBF creates a permanent lack of consensus between buyers and sellers on what transactions are valid in a very important for mass adoption and practical field of 0-conf transactions. It's just like some people just want bitcoin to never get wide adoption.
@_date: 2015-11-29 18:25:55
Permanent in the meaning that this is not just an incident leading to a fork, but the same problem occuring over and over in each transaction.

Which chain is the one true chain? Why not both? All that catastrophe is overhyped. It's just like for each Dollar in each pocket in the world the one Euro appears. Surely, there will be an initial confusion but overall we'll just end up with 2 fully working but incompatible networks and the value of BTC in each will be about 50% of the value before the fork. And everyone will own 2 times more of them. So in the end nothing changes. Almost like a bond split.

Putting aside the question about BU team competence, the way this community behaves is actually malicious. 
A mature and ethical man would file a bug report, not fire an attack. A mature and ethical community would not endorse black hat actions.
@_date: 2015-11-29 18:38:14
I understand that. The case is that i use the word 'consensus' in its dictionary meaning while you're limiting it to some fancy-techy-miny stuff. Yet, disagreement between trading parties on whether 0-conf is _safe enough_ (which used to be the case) or it should be immediately considered a double-spend attempt is also some kind of consensus defficy. And in my opinion it's much more devastating the trust in the ecosystem than even a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:56:41
I read that. Greg made a passive aggressive post on how Core is superior. Both sides behaved childish there.
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:14:20
I perfectly understand what the hardfork is and that RBF doesn't make one. And I still consider Full RBF as vandalism far more dangerous than the hardfork. It introduces new ways of malbehaviour both on payer and miner side and i consider it so devastating just because it is not a fork. With a fork, community would just prefer one or another way and the better one will succeed while the other fail. With RBF - we can't escape from the introduced, unwanted complexity and uncertainty. You say anyone can implement whatever policy they like. My point is that this policy - whatever one chooses - is extra complexity, extra work, extra hindrance for the adoption and is just not needed in the first place.

Strawman.  Although blockchain consensus rules are crucial - relay network is still a part of bitcoin, not some separate and irrelevant being where consensus doesn't matter.

Better look at median. The average is not very comparable to bitcoin because it is heavily affected by smart-contract creation transactions that are much more expensive than simple money transfer and have no equivalent in bitcoin.

But he pretended to represent Core. Yes, I already know he's a liar. And it's not only he signing agreement there, I remind you. And read again what I've said. Just "if - then" statement. A simple statement of what would lead to faster scaling. Why is it triggering you that Core failed at this regardless of the governance model the Core utilizes?
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:00:58
Bit-4 signalling did not started yet. So for now Segwit2x intent is signalled informally by "/NYA/" (New York Agreement) string in coinbase.
So much reality denial in this community...
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:35:29
You failed to mention they signal both SegWit and SegWit2x intent. That means about 90% for the latter, approaching 95% threshold. That means we would have SegWit far earlier if Core just fulfill agreement signed by Adam Back in Hongkong.
@_date: 2017-06-24 14:23:41


No, he signed as a president of BS. Then he edited to be just individual. Then edited back, after community backlash.
Luke-Jr's proposal is laughable at best.
Core has only some special power over this sub. Fortunately.
