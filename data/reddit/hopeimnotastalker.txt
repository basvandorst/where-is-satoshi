That is precisely the situation where it would make the most sense to lend money. You'd lend it out for free, or even for negative interest. If I loan you $10 now, and you pay it back in the future, when $10 is worth more (as it would be in a deflationary environment), I've made money, and didn't even have to charge you interest.

Whether or not I'm right, I'm not going to make an investment I don't believe is a sound one.

That's not how it works. But first, disclaimers:
I don't own any bitcoin. I'm just kind of wandering around reddit and stumbled here. Honestly, and don't hate me for this, I think it's a passing fad. But whether or not I'm right about that, I don't believe it's going to continue to appreciate in value (i.e., deflate) over the next 5 years, so it wouldn't make sense for me to lend it to you at zero or 1% interest.
Anyway, I felt compelled to respond to your original comment (being admittedly ignorant of bitcoin as I am) not because you were wrong about this:


Because I think you're right about that. I responded because of this:


This gets into basic economics not specific to bitcoin, and is 100% wrong. Getting back to this:


If I loan you 1 BTC, I expect to be paid back 1 BTC, *not the current value of 1 BTC, but in dollars*. That's not a "loan in a deflationary currency". That's a loan in dollars. If bitcoin increases in value over the next 5 years, the purchasing power of the 1 BTC that you pay back to me will be higher than it is now. In an inflationary environment, I'd expect you to pay me interest, at a rate above what I think inflation will be. In a deflationary environment, I don't need to charge interest at all, because even zero is higher than a negative number (deflation = negative inflation).
In an inflationary environment, it makes sense to borrow. In a deflationary environment, it makes sense to lend. This is an extraordinary simplification, but so was your original comment, which is why it was so easy to say that it is 100% wrong.

Find me a deflationary currency and we'll talk.
