It all depends on luck really if your pool has a higher hashrate it is obviously finding more blocks at any given time, so in the end your looking at a mining provider with over 4,000 Th/s in one pool so they would be getting the higher % of the finds etc, you are also betting on if power costs or the BTC price goes up they are locked into a fixed contract to supply you with the hash rate.

they state that the lifetime is when the coin is less profitable so chances are they will turn it off before the end of 12 months with those providers

Bfl offer similar services but it costs more I did some calculations, with Bfl, cloud hashing and bitcoin frenzy this does seem the cheapest for this particular service.
