Volatility is also one of the reasons I started Paybits. Assuming you believe in bitcoin, there are two ways to look at volatility:
1. **You believe the price will rise**. Then by purchasing *some* bitcoin ever pay period you mitigate the risk of price fluctuations because of [dollar cost averaging.](
2. **You believe the price will fall**. Then spend bitcoin first! Let's say your pay is $1,000 / week. Maybe you take $100 in bitcoin. Spend those bitcoin first. Buy sheets from Overstock.com. Spend bitcoin when you go out to eat. Whatever, but spend the bitcoin first.
In either case you are helping grow the bitcoin ecosystem. As said:


This is key to creating price stability.

While I agree with your conclusion (new ways of acquiring and distributing coins need to be developed) I feel that your insight is slightly skewed.

While pays $2.00 to check his balance, my bank reimburses me for my ATM fees. Why do you think that is?
Consider the lowly check cashing business. Are check cashiers a) the scum of the earth who pray on the uneducated; or b) a cheaper alternative to banks for low-income individuals?
My point is that the current banking / financial system is vastly different depending on your own financial situation.
Bitcoin has the promise to level the financial playing field. But please remember that a traders with the financial freedom to participate in markets may see the fees different than the worker sending $500 in bitcoin to his family overseas.

Interesting. He asserts central management is better than distributed management and then illustrates the problem by showing the downfall of centrally managed bitcoin exchanges.
Bitcoin as a trustless distributed system works. That's how it was engineered.
Exchanges, built by solitary individuals fail. Exchanges are still maturing and the hunt is on for a distributed fair price exchange protocol.
However, to suggest bitcoin is a failure because of exchange failures is a logical fallacy. A non sequitur.

The protocol targets a block every 10 minutes.
So, 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes in a day
1440 / 10 = 144 blocks per day.
The current block reward is 25 btc per block.
therefore, 144 * 25 = 3600.
Although the network generally is running faster than a block every 10 minutes. 
 shows a block every 457 seconds, which is  block every 7.6 minutes.
So, currently, 1440 / 7.6 = 189 blocks per day.
189 blocks * 25 btc per block = 4725 btc per day.

I like to think of bitcoin (or any digital currency) as a way to exchange digital property in a trustless environment.
In its current implementation value is attributed to the private keys and can be exchanged for currency, but there's nothing stopping an altcoin or colored-coin implementation of bitcoin from tracking titles to physical property.
I think trying to put bitcoin into buckets "pure money" or "information service" is a bit premature as the market will start to sort these issues out.

My current favorite is  using BIP38.
This gives you a paper wallet that's passphrase protected.
BUT please, do yourself and your family a favor and write down the phasephrase and place it in a secure, but accessible place in case of, god forbid, your untimely demise.
Ideally, this would be an attorney who has your will or maybe a safe deposit box if you are so inclined to trust banks.
Just keep the paper wallet separate from the passphrase and make sure whoever has the phasephrase can get the paper wallets and they know who to call to help them get the coin.

For an econ class it would be interesting to look into the cost of the blockchain. That is, what is the cost of storing a piece of data? Is the marginal cost consistent? What happens when marginal cost approaches zero?

@_date: 2014-07-31 21:03:33
Absolutely correct! The money that goes to bitcoin should be post-tax dollars. The issue with integrating a solution into a company's payroll system is that the company must be involved. And, unfortunately, not every employer wants to do that.
So we created an even easier solution... When you sign up we will give you a special account you can give to your employer. To your employer it looks the same as any other checking account. 
However, it's a special account. So when money is direct deposit from payroll it gets converted to bitcoin and sent to *your address*!

We wanted to make our payroll solution completely *employee* driven. It shouldn't matter to your employer if you're getting paid in bitcoin.
There are still a few logistical issues we are fine tuning, but the general idea is to deliver part or all of your pay (you control the amount) to a bitcoin address you control shortly after payday.

I see one possible threat to bitcoin as what might be called the analysis to paralysis phenomena.
Imagine you are a bitcoin developer and you are thinking about implementing a new feature (e.g., Zero coin, or Stealth Addresses) - You're dealing with $10,000,000,000. I'll type that again... $10,000,000,000. Or, as I like to say when asked how many bitcoins I own..... "Lots of Zeros". 
Those are scary numbers.
There's a real need to go slow. 
OTOH, if you are an altcoin... BAM! You implement call it pre-alpha and release it. Done.
So while bitcoin slows adoption of new innovations because of the weight of its own value, alt coins are able to quickly implement new features. 
You never know.... those new features might be earth shaking and slowly supplant bitcoin.

Of course, you are correct. However, from a security perspective we look at attack vectors and attack footprints.

Interestingly, there was a time when the reputation of a business meant something. A time when you asked your neighbor where they took their car to be repaired. A time when you trusted friends to tell you about which butcher you should visit.
The reason was simple: you were spending hard cash and if there was a problem you couldn't get it back.
However, today, with the advent of credit cards and charge backs there is no reason to rely on reputation. Or trust. Simply, blindly provide your credit card and if there is a problem a "too big to fail" corporation will solve your problem. No worry.

And this is exactly the problem! We are so accustomed to having security layered on to the internet as an after thought that we fail to see what the internet would look like with native security. 
What if government pushed / encouraged / whatever:
* All hard drives are natively encrypted
* All phone calls are natively encrypted
* All text messages are natively encrypted
* deterministic hardware keys storing / generating unique passwords were used
* A method to verify the identity of an organization and not just the user (e.g. how do I know it's my bank that's calling / emailing me?
* PCI compliance was built natively into databases
These are just a few examples. But if some of these were implemented both gox and Ottawa would have been avoided.

Let's say the 21M cap has been reached and you are the proud owner of 1 bitcoin.
Now someone who owns ZERO bitcoins comes along and says, "I'd like some of that action. How 'bout we raise that 21M cap to 42M"
What do you think would happen to the value of your bitcoin? Would you "vote" for such a change?
Why should/would anyone vote to raise that limit?
If 50.1% of the network doesn't vote in favor of the change the change won't happen.

HSBC settled their case for 5 weeks of profit. To equate this solution to Shrem (assuming a generous $150,000 per year salary and a 30% tax rate) would mean Shrem would pay $10,068.49  and the problem would go away.

The benefits of being paid in bitcoin is that you are actively helping the bitcoin ecosystem.
There are plenty of merchants willing to accept bitcoin for whatever reason.
By taking some of your pay in bitcoin and then spending those coins at merchants accepting bitcoin, you are growing the bitcoin ecosystem.
Consider what the federal reserve does when there is a lull in the economy... They encourage spending by making money more freely available. Bitcoin doesn't have this option, so the only way to "pump" the economy is to spend bitcoin.

Perhaps you correctly observe the hysteria, but I believe the long term outcry will not be that bitcoin is taxable, but rather the tax treatment of bitcoin as property versus currency.
@_date: 2014-06-04 00:40:13
I'm using digital to mean anything that can be expressed in numbers.
Let's take title to real property as an example. You can prove ownership of real property by an unbroken chain of ownership.
Consider: Alice owned property and then transferred the property to Bob and Bob then transferred it to Carol.
You could then store ownership as a hash of the title of Alice. And then hash the hash of Alice's title with the hash of Bob's title and so on.
The hashes stored in a blockchain would prove ownership (And a chain of ownership). 
So even though real property is tangible, and not a number, the title document (either text or image) can be hashed and then exchanged in a trustless environment using blockchain technology.

I'm not saying a 51% attack. I'm saying 51% of nodes voting in favor of a change. Is this misapplication?
You have nodes and miners. Nodes relay transactions. Miners build blocks. Nodes check to see if the transactions are ~~valid~~ conform to the protocol.
If a change, say Change1, is made the nodes won't broadcast it.
OK, so you and I agree to Change1, no one else. We run modified versions of bitcoind with Change1 implemented. We can pass the transaction back and forth. Cool, but it doesn't get incorporated into a block.
We would have to have the hash power to mine our own block. Let's say we do that. No one else on the network likes our block and so the blockchain is forked.
I suppose what you are saying is the fork could bifurcate bitcoin into two currencies and both currencies could survive?
It take 100 confirmations before coinbase transactions can be spent. That means the miners who approve Change1 must persist in their "attack" for over 100 blocks. I'm not the math guy, but it seems that the economic incentive, regardless of what Change1 does,  is to mine the primary chain.

Automated buys are a great way to purchase bitcoin.
I tried to use this approach when saving money. For me, the "problem" is I always knew the money would go into my checking account first, and invariably an emergency would arise where I would spend it. When my company offered a 401k plan it was like I never missed the money because it always went into my investment first.
I tried to recreate this approach with Paybits, allowing the money to go directly into bitcoin and not into your checking account first. In fact, your bitcoin goes directly to an address you specify bypassing any 3rd party holding your coin.

Leaving the irony of his message aside... (“*It’s a terrible store of value. It could be replicated over and over*,” he said.)
I believe it's important, as has been suggested before, that the fungibility layer must be separated from the transactional layer.
Otherwise bitcoin "*will eventually be made as a payment system to follow the same standards as the other payment systems and that will probably be the end of them*.” 
The analogy is TCP/IP as a transport layer. TCP/IP doesn't care about the contents of the packets it sends. It just sends them.
The application layer, the logs of the ISPs, etc, etc are responsible for aiding law enforcement when there is evidence of misconduct. 
Similarly, the fungibility layer of bitcoin must remain agnostic to the transactions it sends.
Without agnosticism bitcoin will lose its fungibility and gradually be burdened with the exact regulations that current payment systems must follow. Leading, as predicted,  to the end of bitcoin.

So to be clear, we are talking about a 51% bad actor and not a normal blockchain reorg.
Part of the power in bitcoin is the size of the network. That is, it would take substantial resources to acquire 51% of the network hash power. Satoshi's argument in his whitepaper is that it is economically more feasible for the 51% owner to NOT manipulate the blockchain.
If a bad actor were to make a 51% attack, I believe the value of bitcoin would crash and possible never recover.
Bitcoin, and the blockchain by extension do not solve a 51% attack - they solve trust over an untrusted network.  
In a normal world if your transaction made it into the blockchain and there was a standard reorg (not 51% attack), your transaction would still be there.

You are, of course, correct. No one knows what will happen to the price.

If you don't know what will happen (that is you don't know whether price will rise or fall) but still believe digital currency has power, then spend all of your bitcoin every single pay period. 
By spending all of your bitcoin every pay period you will still be helping the bitcoin ecosystem without exposing yourself to volatility.

Push versus Pull transactions. May I please have your credit card number? 
With your bank account or credit card number I can pull money out of your account. Of course, you'll get it back, you don't have to worry about fraud. "Those companies" take care of that for you.
However, there is a cost that you, as a consumer, pay for "those companies" that make it so you don't pay for fraud. We don't really think about that, do we?
Even your bank account is insured (if you live in the US) by the FDIC against the banks doing bad stuff. Do you believe this is a free government handout? Of course not, we, the ~~consumer~~  tax payer, pay for that.
Bitcoin flips the status quo with push transactions. You can publish your public key to the world and the worst that happens is you receive money. 
Bitcoin also comes with responsibility. Because it can't be reversed, you need to make sure you know who you are sending it to. 
However, the responsibility also has advantages, such as eliminating counter-party risk.
Is bitcoin better than cash? Better than a credit card? Better than a savings account?
I would suggest it's simply different, conveying unique advantages, responsibilities, and, of course, disadvantages. 
If the unique characteristics of crypto currencies don't appeal to you or don't solve a problem you have, then, by all means, carry on with fiat.

Well, my recollection is that Satoshi responded with something like, "It seemed like a good number," but I can't find the reference.
If you're bent on finding a formula you might try this one from [StackExchange](
* 6 blocks per hour
* 24 hours per day
* 365 days per year
* 4 years per cycle
* = 210,240
* ~= 210,000
* Sum all the block reward sizes:
50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 + ... = 100
Multiply the two:
210,000 * 100 = 21 million.
Alternatively, (from the same source)


But I still think those are just ways of backing into a number where no one knows where it came from.

Consider a company that transacts business in both EUR and USD. If that company obtained a letter of credit for the purchase of goods in EUR but were funding the transaction in USD they may wish to hedge their position in the foreign exchange market.
A business using bitcoins to facilitate trade/transactions may likewise engage in speculation in bitcoin. This is an important clarification because as written the 2013 *guidance* made it sound like if you converted dollars to bitcoin you were an *exchanger* and thus needed to register with FinCEN.

I like you point! 
I've felt that, currently, when merchants take bitcoin (I'm looking at you overstock.com) they do get additional revenue, but the real benefit is in the media exposure.
This is an advantage for the first movers in the space.
Your suggestion is that companies provide a mechanism for bitcoin holders to get preferential treatment for a product or service over fiat.
That would be a cool experiment! Because, what that means, is if the incentive is great enough, individuals who support the product but who have never purchased bitcoin would convert fiat to bitcoin because they want access to the exclusivity.

First world problem example. Say you manage a $500,000,000 family fund. The fund does charity work as well as manages the trust for the 18 grandchildren, nephews, nieces, and second cousins of the grantor.
As the manager of this fund, you are a skeptical bastard. You aren't sure if China will default on it's U.S. debt, you definitely believe the Fed engaged in rehypothecation by melting German gold, and to top it off you weren't invited to the Davos Summit this year.
Where do you put your money so it won't lose value? Bitcoin? Maybe a small part - 'cause you're a rebel. But the fluctuation in value would drive the 18 family members to drink more than they already do. 
To function as a store of value what you put in must be about what you get out at any given point in time. Otherwise it's either a) an investment; b) speculation; or c) burning money.

It's not the trading of the stock that creates the value. Nor is it the trading of bitcoin that creates the value.

The question the blockchain answered was this: How do you trade digital goods in a trustless environment?
The answer was the blockchain. Funny enough [this image]( about how to create trust is exactly how the blockchain works.
So now extrapolate the solution. You can apply the solution to anything that has previously been centralized because a lack of trust existed. 
Voting is one example. You needed a centralized ledger of registered voters because there was no way to ensure one person one vote without centralization.  
The implementation of these solutions could be on separate blockchains, but [ethereum]( ) offers a possibility that those solutions could coexist on a single blockchain.

Bitcoin operates as a public ledger. All transactions are publicly viewable. Anyone who has a private key can make an entry into this public ledger.
Before we get to how trust is enabled, let's imaging a non-blockchain system that does the same. Say your bank. Imagine if your bank put their ledger of accounts on the internet and allowed anyone with an account to make an entry. What would happen? Chaos. Oh, and my bank account would have lot's of zeros in it! 
Why does the bank example fail? Because the only way to verify funds exist in your account is to have centralized control of the accounts.
Bitcoin, via the blockchain, verifies the coin you are trying to move with your private key exists. The way the validation happens is in the 10 minutes it takes to create a block all bitcoin nodes are checking to see if your transaction is valid. If it's not valid it's rejected by consensus.
In a nutshell the genius of the blockchain is to give time to the nodes to validate all transactions and through consensus reject or accept transactions as appropriate.
So when we say bitcoin enables trust - it means we trust the transactions placed into the public ledger are valid.

The second ruling is a bit more involved, but basically says if you are a business you can purchase/speculate/use bitcoin as part of your business as long as the purchase/speculation is not your business.

 * "The exchange of property for the same kind of property is the most common type of nontaxable exchange"

The issue with a single paper wallet is if the paper is destroyed, as in fire. Multiple paper wallets stored in different secure locations protect from this.
There are two additional issues with the paper wallet once the private key has been scanned. First, there is a chance that the private key has been intercepted and thus compromised. The second issue is more theoretical, but there exists the possibility to extract the private key from multiple blockchain transactions for a given address if a poor random number generator was used. 
Thus, the preferred method is to store large amounts in cold storage (paper wallet) and then transfer what is needed to your hot wallet and then transfer the remainder of the cold wallet to a new address.

Right. See Q-8
I'd argue that the IRS will see a fork like an instamine and the IRS would argue you owe tax on the income from the fork regardless of whether it is spent or not.
There really are no virtual currency rules or opinions to go by. It's an example of technology outpacing government's ability to figure out what to do.

I'm not sure it's like a stock split. For example, if you own 100 units of Stock A and it splits 1:2. then you own 200 units of Stock A.
This event is more like a spin-off where a parent company spins off a subsidiary. In that case there can be a tax-free spin off, but a tax-free spin off is built on some very specific irs rules. I think this is more like a dividend and would be fully taxable.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:40:56
I agree, with the exception that the IRS considers mining a taxable event. How is this different from some sort of instamine?
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:21:26
Technically.... they are taxed when they mine. That is the basis they have in the property (property as the IRS sees it).
So say you mine at $1,000. You pay tax on $1,000. When you sell you pay tax on the difference between the price and the basis. So if you sell for $1,200 you pay an tax on the additional $200.
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:31:17
Thanks. How do you see mining rewards? The same way?
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:25:52
It seems like the best path forward would be to create an opinion on  a defensible position that a fork is similar to a tax-free spin-off. 
Then, if audited, and the IRS decided a fork was a taxable event, you'd probably pay just the tax and not the penalty.

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, states that:
"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."
Perhaps one of the more elegant expressions of this right comes from Victor Hugo:
“On resiste a l’invasion des armees; on ne resiste pas a l’invasion des idees.” – “One can resist the invasion of armies; one cannot resist the invasion of ideas.” 
The "invasion of ideas" as a basic human right is important because without discourse how can one change the status quo? Without freedom of thought where is progress? Where is freedom from tyranny? 
By extension I would argue that financial freedom of opinion and expression become as important as verbal or written expression. This argument, salient today because of the commercial nature of expression, must be inalienable and inextricable for all citizens of the world.

Just to be clear. The transaction was for $1.62 (0.01252 btc). But the transaction paid over 80 btc in **transaction fees.**
This is most likely because the transaction was manually created and  the calculation of inputs and outputs got messed up.
The way bitcoin works is that when you create a transaction you provide INPUTS and then you provide OUTPUTS. If Inputs &gt; Output then the network treats the excess as transaction fees. In this case over $10,000 in transaction fees.

Finally! Someone who really understands security. 
My approach is similar, but different.
I've eschewed all electronic devices and I've hand calculated the ECDSA from a random 64 character string (my private key) that was randomized by collecting gps coordinates from animal droppings, summing the coordinates together and then doing a mod 256 on the sum.
Please note I say gps but actually calculated it from a sextant and a sun dial. It is a bit difficult hauling a sun dial with you as you look for scat, but well worth the effort.
Finally, for my public key I converted that to a QR code that has been hand knitted into a scarf.

Isn't that analysis what separates good mathematicians from bad? Or good businessmen from bad?
I would suggest that **successful** miners have a conservative estimate of the difficulty increase based on their knowledge of the market.

This analysis is not static but dynamic, changing as more information is learned.

This is from my response to a thread on [bitcointalk](
I've given the issue much thought and happened across [this reference, a legal challenge]( to the introduction of Scottish Banknotes in 1695.
At issue was whether the recipient of a tainted banknote could be held responsible for previous illegal acts committed with the banknote. Essentially, does the holder of a banknote (bitcoin) have free and clear title to that note despite its previous history?
The Royal Bank of Scotland prevailed in the lawsuit. The legal argument essentially said that not providing title upon acceptance of a banknote "would be to render the Notes absolutely useless, and consequently would in a great Measure deprive the Nation of the Benefit of the Banks, which could hardly subsist without the Circulation of their Notes".
I would suggest the same for bitcoin. That the holder of the private key must have free and clear title to the bitcoins represented by the private key.
**Any centralize repository of tainted coins would, in effect, inhibit the free circulation of bitcoins making them, in the words of the 18th Century court "absolutely useless".**

Manual transactions are created when coding custom software that does something with bitcoin. Maybe a new exchange or new shopping cart.
Unfortunately, what happens is the software encounters something unanticipated and screws up the transaction.
The PSA here is that anyone coding bitcoin transaction should have a

There are two ways.
1. Yubikey - this is a hardware device that you purchase from Mt. Gox and they mail to you
2. Google Authenticator - This is software that's installed on your smart phone.
I'll explain 
1. Download a QR reader program - Try "Red Laser"
2. Download Google Authenticator
3. Log into Gox
4. Click "Security enter"
5. Under login, Select "Software Authenticator" - and click "Add New"
6. This will then show you a QR code. Scan the QR code with Red Laser
7. Red Laser will ask you if you want to open it - say yes
8. This will open google authenticator, which will prompt you to add Mt Gox. Do it.
9. Return to "Security Center" and under "Login" select "add method" and chose the authenticator you created. You now have MFA enabled for login. 
Repeat  for withdrawal and security center.
It's not as hard as all the steps make it seem.

Do I understand correctly that if the $10,000 were wired to your bank you do not file an 8300? But only if the $10,000 was paid in physical cash?
The result being there is a "cash" trail to follow in either case (i.e., either banking records or the 8300).
It's interesting that barter transactions are exempt. What would you do if someone came in with 20,000 euros?

Here's how I imagine it would work:
1. me:  Hey I'd like to use your service
2. you: ok, send me some btc from an address you control.
3. me: ok, but how do you know I control it?
4. you: send me a signed message that says, "I'm funding btc address xyz on mm/dd/yyyy"
5. me: ok, here's the signed message. And I just sent the coins
So now you have the coins from an address and a signed message from that address. They only way you can sign a message is with the private key and the only person who has the private key is in control of the address.

Sorry for the OP's loss. I follow these post closely, probably in the belief that if I read enough of them I can avoid the same mistake. There's probably some term for that belief...
Anyway, what I've come to believe is that the attack vector being exploited is the reused password. This is totally a guess, but I think what happens is a website is compromised. The hashed (or not) passwords are taken and ran through rainbow tables. Usernames ( from reddit or bitcointalk) are then matched with the stolen accounts and passwords. 
So, my personal belief is the issue is not gox or bad security on the home network, but rather the reuse of passwords and usernames.

Ah, very clever of you to respond with my retort before me. I believe I shall use the "it was obviously implied" response here.

I don't agree. Size and attributes both contribute to value.
Size correlates to the integrity of the network. It is the integrity of the network that allow value to be given to the attributes.
However, consider:
If the bitcoin protocol lacked the ability for m of n transactions would there be as much value?
If an altcoin implemented smart property (or any new feature) before bitcoin would the value of the altcoin increase?
Take or add attributes and see if the value remains the same.

No doubt! If an alt coin == counterfeit bitcoin, that is, if an alt coin devalues bitcoin, then bitcoin is doomed. 
However, if the value of bitcoin is placed in the development team, the size of the network (hash rate), even something like first to market, then bitcoin will succeed.
IMHO, it will succeed until something that adds more value (what value and how are currently undefined) arrives. Alts provide that ability of experimentation.
Heck, maybe something discovered or something learned from an exploit of an alt  will be incorporated into bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:18:45
Authority and due process invested in whom? It scares me to think a single individual can transfer coins and then blacklist those coins.
But more to the point, if you believe non-repudiation is one of the core attributes of bitcoin, then blacklisting coins would negate that advantage.

IANAL. I haven't seen the talks.... however, my experience in using (paying a shit ton to) lawyers is this:
Lawyers give you the worst case. They give you the "my-license-is-on-the line-if-I-give-you-bad-advice" version of what *could* happen. And... well, and it very well may happen.
But this is what separates the dreamers / entrepreneurs from everyone else.
The entrepreneurs listens to the lawyer, considers the possibilities and makes an informed wager based on his or her knowledge of the world. Make no doubt about it. It is a wager. (probably a second mortgage wager)
Maybe the entrepreneurs bets wrong. It's happened plenty of times. The riches to rags story isn't something we generally dwell on; nor are books written about it.
However, it is possible the entrepreneur succeeds. They over come the obstacles by going over, under, around, or through the obstacles. 
My message is this: Listen, learn, understand... but ultimately make your own decision. Don't let a negative assessment of the current environment dissuade you from your dreams.

I've been intrigued with this idea for some time. Not using the currency BTC, but the concept of the blockchain.
Take a look [at this article]( It describes a process for a corporation, that I think would be a starting place for a sovereign nation.
Rights, treaties, laws could all somehow be included. 
The ultimate concept being the creation of a virtual nation that was recognized by physical nations.
Why woud physical nations recognized these digital vagabonds who most likely transact all their business in untaxable virtual currencies? 
Most likely because the digital vagabond would pay a tax to reside in the country of his or her choice. 
In exchange for the tax the state would provide all services (or a select subset of services) offered to their citizens plus an agreement to somehow merge the laws of the virtual nation with local laws.

I'd love to see a serious discussion on banks and bitcoin. But we need to move past the simple notion that "banks hate bitcoin because.... bitcoin".
Banks are subject to a plethora of regulations and bank officers can be held [personally liable for bank actions or inactions]( 
So pretend you are a bank officer making a VERY nice salary and living in a VERY nice home and someone says, "hey, you need to accept this non-regulated crypto-thingy" - What would you do???
How should banks treat bitcoin? Asset? Currency? Commodity?
What provisions of the BSA apply to bitcoin? How does the bank's current AML practices apply to bitcoin-related businesses?
Does accepting bitcoin violate the banks charter?
How do banks ensure a business that handles bitcoin isn't laundering money?
These are the easy starter questions.

I'm approaching it from a slightly more practical standpoint. I assume what the US wants to do is protect is the hegemony of the US Dollar.
I assume that "others" may want to see the threat of force implied by dollar reduced or eliminated. The only viable approach to eliminating the dollar from world reserve status seems to be one of a currency war. (asking politely ain't gonna work)
The first salvos in this war have already been fired, and skirmishes arise daily. For example, China / Australia direct trade agreement, China / Japan direct trade agreement, etc. 
That is, China is settling its trade debt with Japan directly and not using the US dollar. The benefit is a reduced cost (you don't purchase dollars) the draw back is default risk.
One of the possible outcomes is a non-state sponsored currency. The [bancor](  is receiving renewed interest and other approaches have been bantered about.
While perhaps a long shot, crypto currencies may play a role in the current currency war. My argument is that with crypto currencies as even a *possibility* governments should, at a minimum, not create barriers to their use. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:13:08
I agree. To summarize your concern: 
The attacker has complete control and complete knowledge of your customers computer. 
The only way to solve that problem is to take the computer out of the equation. Multi-part sigs would do that. The physical sig would be stored by the customer in a safe location. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:30:15
I've thought about the same. 
You would send a tamper evident pouch to the recipient. The recipient places the paper wallets in the pouch and seals it. It is then sent to you.
I think the wallets would all remain unfunded until you notified the recipient they were placed in storage.
You could then return the tamper proof pouch when needed. 
Alternatively, you open the pouch, redeem the private key and send the bitcoins to the address specified by the recipient. 
The one downside is this approach requires trust. Trust that you won't open the tamper proof pouch or a perhaps a m-n private key approach.
In any case I'm not sure a bank is where you would want to store them. I'd opt for a secure private storage facility. Preferably, one that has had experience storing gold.

When a miner (pool) submits a block it includes all the transactions for the block, plus a special transaction called the coinbase transaction. The miner submits the coinbase transaction with the current block reward, (25 btc + any leftover fees from the transactions, i.e., the transaction fees) and an BTC address.
Now the blockchain has a new transaction that includes this special coinbase transaction associated with the address the miner gave.
If the miner tried to submit 50btc instead of 25btc the clients would all reject the block.

I'd agree with the assessment of the time of the attack based on the reuse of the change address.
My guess is that since you had *both* litecoin and bitcoin wallets hacked that the hacker had access to your passwords. I'd further guess that perhaps he gained access to your password manager?? Do you use one?

I would argue governments have two choices for crypto currencies: 1) to tolerate crypto currencies; or 2) legislate / fight / outlaw.
I believe game theory suggests the correct course is to tolerate. 
Assume crypto currencies FAIL. Playing out the two previous options: tolerance doesn't matter because the crypto currency has failed; fighting doesn't matter either because the currency has failed.
Assume the crypto currency SUCCEEDS.  Tolerance allows the government tolerating the crypto currency to possible succeed; Fighting a successful crypto currency places the fighting government on the losing side of the battle.
Therefore, the correct decision of ANY government should be one of tolerance.

Yes, and that proof, ideally, would come through due process, which isn't the fastest process. The slowness of justice would make a blacklist useless. The converse, something like a DMCA Takedown Notice, would tie up coins without any proof. And bitcoin would not survive.
I'd suggest that as part of the paradigm shift that will happen with the adoption of bitcoin is a shift in responsibility.
Currently we outsource the security of our money. We pay bank service charges and merchants pass along credit card fees to consumers which help cover the cost of fraudulent purchases. 
Part of the responsibility of bitcoin is the responsibility of security. Perhaps, in the future, there will be other options for securing your coins, but today it is the individual who is responsible.

And this is why I LOVE reddit. Thank you for your insightful response. Damn, give me a minute while I put the gray matter back in my skull....
My assumption is that negative interest incents an individual to "put his money to work" rather than keeping it in a bank.
The logical result of negative interest is to withdrawal the money from the bank and keep it under your mattress. 
You lose me on why an individual would default on the negative interest rather than hide it in a mattress.
Now, regarding upcoin &amp; downcoin. I assume the intended response is that downcoin is spent in the economy and not "mattressized". You assert that by doing so would create a hyperinflation spiral. 
I think what would happen is that everyone would spend downcoin but dictate their return be paid in upcoin - I think this is the intended response, no?

Kinda.... With a brainwallet the passphrases are converted into [rainbow tables]( with the public and private key. The blockchain is then monitored for the public key and when it is identified the bitcoins can be taken instantly.
With a truecrypt container you would have to run each passphrase against the container, wait for the result, and then repeat until cracked.

Yep. It's crazy how many people ignore (or are ignorant of...) basic P/L analysis.
That being said, I'll assume that someone can "do the math". The issue, then, is the preorder conundrum. 
Who do you trust? I would argue that by the time "trust" is known the network hashrate has surpassed the requirements for a positive return on your investment.

I too have been doing a lot of late night thought experiments while drifting off to sleep. I think it's easy to see some of the obvious outcomes decentralized currencies will lead to (e.g. weakening of governments by loss of tax revenue)
Some of your other conclusions, while probable, seem unlikely. Why aren't children being kidnapped and sold for untraceable USD today?
I tend to believe that governments will naturally trend towards smaller physical boundaries, with citizenship being vested in virtual countries where local customs, religious laws, etc. can be customized regardless of the domicile of the citizen. For the privilege of living in these micro countries a tax will be paid.
Interesting times, indeed.

Sure. It's a [false dilemma]( The way it is set up is either bitcoin becomes the world currency and succeeds. Or it isn't the world currency and fails.
The article attempts to demonstrate why bitcoin can not be a world currency, therefore, it fails.
What isn't presented is that there is no safe haven for wealth storage. Housing? Gold? Stocks? What?
An inflationary currency forces me to invest. After all, if I don't, my money is inflation-taxed away. But I might be a bad investor and lose money. What if I just want to save something safely for a rainy day?
Additionally, it's not either-or. Bitcoin can exist **in addition to** other currencies. Because of it's deflationary nature, merchants should be discounting their merchandise when purchased with bitcoin.
Don't let articles like this negatively influence your thinking.

b) I have 100 btc. I buy mining equipment costing 100 btc that produces 150 btc over 6 months. Price rises by 100%.  I have 150 btc.
It seems buying mining equipment is the wining move.

A well thought out article. While there are various points of debate in the article, I would like to highlight one particular point that was not directly addressed:


I would suggest that altcoins provide backup protection to an undesirable fork in bitcoin brought about by a change in the protocol by the development team predicated on some "well meaning but utterly unwarranted and unwanted" feature.
For example, centralized multi factor authentication.
In this case, altcoins provide an alternative to choosing a (possibly loosing) fork.

It's good to have a discussion and the discussion gets really boring if its one sided. OP has valid points.
The point I think is interesting is bitcoin as a network (as separate from its value as a commodity or currency) will continue to grow. New innovations and applications will be created. 
To me the China news means that current financial institutions will be excluded from creating new innovations which means bitcoin will grow up outside the current financial infrastructure. 
Not that this wouldn't have happened organically, but the news simply underscores the fact that the old guard will not participate.

I've always thought merchants accepting bitcoin should offer a discount. The idea is that bitcoin, as a deflationary currency, should, by its deflationary nature, encourage those who own bitcoin to hold on to the coins, because they will be worth more tomorrow than today.
The only way to get those holding coins to spend the coins is to make goods "cheaper" today. This can be done by discounting goods purchased with bitcoin.
Of course, in reality, the merchant would have a hard time paying their bills if all goods were purchased at a discount with bitcoin. But I doubt that will be the case in the near term.

The concept of the decreasing block reward is a very powerful feature in bitcoin.
Think of miners as "those that make transaction blocks". Miners are the guys who package all of the individual transactions into a single block and plop it on the blockchain. 
Who would want to do that? 
To solve that problem and the problem of how to get bitcoin into circulation the protocol rewards miners who are able to put a block on the blockchain - Initially this reward was 50 btc, but has now reduced to 25 btc.
The idea is that as bitcoin continues to be accepted more transaction fees will be included each transaction. Who get's the transaction fees? The miners.
So, as the block reward continues to decrease the transaction fees should start to increase, so that when all bitcoins are put into circulation the blockchain will still be maintained by miners but they do it because of the transaction fees.

So, from a mining perspective I've "made money". Because the current price is above $800.
If, on the other hand, I would have bought bitcoin rather than mining equipment, I would have made **more** money.
However, I like the idea of mining as a way of learning. It might not be the most cost effective way of getting bitcoins but it is fun!

The issue in the US is that the tax is an *income*. As a US citizen you must declare your **world wide** income and pay tax on that amount.
The government has pursued tax haven countries with such vigor because it makes it easy to hide money, not declare it, and then when audited deny its existence.
Bitcoins have the same problem.
There are auditing ways to verify the income reporting  problem. For example, a small motel might be cashed based. I've heard of auditors comparing the number of bars of soap to revenue to determine if the income was reported correctly. The same thing with self serve laundries - you can compare electricity usage to revenue.
However, none of this gets to the heart of the matter that income based tax is problematic. 
Other approaches could be value added tax, sales tax, use tax, property tax, residency tax, etc. Each tax system has its advantages and disadvantages, but if crypto currency is to survive, I predict there will be a change in the way taxes are assessed.

You have a couple of choices. 1) Join a pool. You don't need to install the bitcoin client, you just need a mining client like cgminer. Set each computer up as a separate miner, and you can quickly see when once computer has failed.
2) you can solo mine. In that case you need the bincoin-qt client and some knowledge of how to configure it.
In any case each miner works on discrete units of work.
As far as power, when you are mining you typically max out the video cards resulting in a lot more energy usage.

I believe there are several issues at play. First, is the issue of transaction size. If you have **a lot** of money, say $100,000 and you want to buy bitcoin, how do you do it?
Right now there simply is no way for large investors to get money into the bitcoin economy.
Second, is the issue of trust. Most wire transactions I've seen involve wiring through a bank in poland to get the money into... say gox. Oh wait, gox isn't taking US wires :)
Demonstrated another way.... Which exchange would you wire $100,000 to and feel secure about it?
Personally, I believe the lack of investment vehicles for large investors is one of the reasons for the decline of btc to usd right now.
