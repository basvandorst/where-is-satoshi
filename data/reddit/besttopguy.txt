@_date: 2018-01-20 16:24:07
You can just use a flash drive. Trezor basically is the same thing just with a screen
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:27:38
Haven't enjoyed a crypto app that wasn't an to buy/sell. This is great app

I've been into crypto for about 50 days and I have made a 120% return on my money so far. I know it's not sustainable or likely but it **is** possible in bull markets 
But yea who tf would invest other ppls money if they can already be making bank on their own.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:54:47
It does allow new people to join in so that is kinda healthy in a way
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:35:45
That website is unusable for me on mobile. if anyone can find a way to contact them can you send them this link so they can fix it? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:32:50
Put it in a freezer

What's the name of the place
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:18:47
Take a good 5-10min to read about what bitcoin is and how it is traded. I hear r/bitcoin could help you answer any questions you have as it seems you are brand new.
Haven't seen an idiot like you in so long. I want to believe ur just a troll but I'm pretty sure ur just fkn stupid.

Old people’s dicks won’t be the only thing getting pumped tonight
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:55:04
Never thought about the kids. If a kid can go into a store and put his $10  cash into btc then he can go buy anything online. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:53:13
We got Washington’s, Edison’s, and benjies
@_date: 2018-08-10 03:26:24
Think about the whole generation of children who are gonna buy bitcoin with the money of the whole old people generation about to die off. Like when trump dies his boys gonna pump crypto with his stacks
@_date: 2018-08-23 17:35:41
Good news
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:20:22
He meant the part where it goes down first. It was a asymptote shape not a “U”/parabolic shape
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:30:10
Just paid $850 for 2017 gains this week. After suffering 90% loss of my total money from this years shit show. Fuck the irs.
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:16:02
Still 3-4 tps right?
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:56:33
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:50:03
But the point is you are on reddit so obviously not a bitcoin billionaire so no one knew the future
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:26:57
College kids probably know about it more than most, but have way less money to invest than most. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:03:17
Idk man but it's something to look forward to in the future cuz transferring btc won't take a week lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:50:03
Is your money not in your bank account anymore?
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:41:41
Jesus that sounds faster than ethereum. I’ll buy some 
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:16:15
Unless you bought at ath
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:04:59
Yea now that everyone wants more bear they gonna flip the bull market switch
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:08:05
Eat ur pp if it dont
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:02:27
why so many of the "told you so" people come here just to say told you so. btc literally crashes all the time. this isn't even the big one and its getting so much publicity this year from the rise was round one of going mainstream, and the crash is round 2 of getting into public eyes. now that everyone has heard about it, many have learned how to buy it, next time it goes up 20% its going TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:55:40
 make an alt where everybody gets the same amount to start and there is no mining profits just a centralized blockchain
@_date: 2019-01-28 09:52:49
Yea lol I’ve used bitcoin at a dispensary before
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:48:32
thank god lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:58:30
I would guess, and I'm pulling this all out of my ass, a redditor can't even make a difference unless a btc post got to the  best of. This subreddit is small compared to the world considering btc is global with probably only 100-500k daily readers 20% of who don't own btc and the other 75% who don't have a ton of money in the market to make an impact. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:03:42
What if 7 billion ppl all spent their lives generating one
@_date: 2019-01-22 01:44:16
The internet is the technology of this time. Satellite internet coverage over the entire earth is the technology of the next decade so this won’t be a problem forever
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:56:18
Just stop bro lol no one would want only 10btc to take down a $20 billion coin. This is where you take out the big loan to hire personal bodyguards and forever change your identity and make billions off blackmailing/crashing bcash or selling info to big players. You probably mean you can right click, inspect, and change the price on a website lel
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:20:57
Yea they don't even take it now lol they dunno

@_date: 2018-02-10 10:11:11
Got em
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:47:31
The point is the mail app is free like other crypto apps
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:02:46
But there is a gmail app and the equivalent to the is the the mail app would cost money
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:05:28
Buy now
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:25:55
You can put $20 cash into a btc wallet thru an ATM. You can then send that $20 worth of btc anywhere in the world. Seems like it still cost $20 to me and it was global and more private than say PayPal. Almost like handing them the $20 in person. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:19:29

Still can pack up all your money on a flash drive and take off to live out your days in another county with no one knowing where you are
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:38:03
The only thing that can go wrong is people just rather using their good ole debit cards that are near instantaneous at the checkout counter and provide a better false sense of security with the little chips n shit than btc will be able to. 
You know how you only have so much time to fumble around trying to get the 6 dollars out of your wallet before the people in line behind you start wondering what's with you. Btc has to get way more convenient cuz cash is fast and inconvenient but debit cards are just fast and convenient. 
Mass adoption will be a challenge but we are only in btc infancy
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:04:40
That post would be a good movie

How much money in fees would it cost for one guy to spam attack the whole network

Ez just get your private key tattood on the inside of your skull. If they want your bitcoins they can smash your head like a piggy bank
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:43:51
There are things already made that allow you to easily accept 10+ cryptos and have them all just swap to fiat upon completion of the transaction. It’s so ez to accept crypto payments than setup a credit card payment if you are running a booth at a farmers market or somethin
