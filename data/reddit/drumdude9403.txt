You do know that  if you are worried about Coinbase watching your transactions, that there would still be a record that your bank account is linked to a Bitcoin address, right? And since so many people today use wallets with only one flippin address, every transaction can be monitored.. 
Obviously if that is not what you're worried about, then disregard it. But then what is the problem?

Apple's unwillingness to support Bitcoin by banning wallet apps for iOS devices was a big reason why I decided to finally make the switch to Android back in September, among other things. 
But I read something a few weeks ago that talked about how Blockchain.info was hesitant to update the iOS wallet app for fear of the entire app being removed from the App Store due to continued increases of feature regulations in the App Store agreement. 
But I don't understand why they haven't updated the Android app yet. I would really like it if the app would be as pleasing to use as the web service. If nothing happens in the next few weeks, I'm going to switch all of my funds in Blockchain to Mycellium or Coinbase (which is also a hard decision for me haha) as my hot wallet.

I used to wonder this, too. But the term "libertarian" is pretty broad now. There are so many sub categories within the philosophy (anarchists, classical liberals, minarchists, etc.) that the party can't even begin to adequately represent all of the different ideologies. 
And most importantly, a lot of libertarians (notably anarchists) will not vote because doing so is contradictory to their ideology; if one opposes the state as a whole, why would he take part in the system?

I will contact them tomorrow! But I also think that someone should contact BitPay (or any other merchant service, really) to see if they can offer their services with the software already on the screen/table-tablet/wtf-do-you-call-those-things-?
Nobody is going to want to start integrating Bitcoin if they have to buy a new device just for Bitcoin. Imagine if the credit card companies did that; depending on the type of card you were using, the waiter (or you if they have DIY table-tablet-things like chili's) would have to toggle between 3-4 different machines. That would get really annoying, I think.

The was an article I read on CoinDesk a couple weeks ago about how Coinbase gets the big merchants to start accepting Bitcoin. Lemme try to find it. 
But I also imagine that the no fees until you've received over $1,000,000 in payments is really attractive for merchants who are on the border between accepting it or not.

people are not using them. A lot of people are still hoarding them right now for whatever reasons they have. I think your looking at the market cap for bitcoin as a market cap for a stock; it's totally different when it's a currency.
@_date: 2014-07-11 12:10:33


Idk about that...
It's diversified more than using one single address, but the source of the RNG is the same; if the Bitaddress.org RNG is found to be flawed, all of your addresses generated from there are potentially vulnerable. I use different clients to 'diversify my risk'
but that's just me :)

@_date: 2014-02-17 20:21:20
Downloading the blockchain is important because it allows you to run a full node on the network without relying on any third party. If you use a client like Electrum or MultiBit you're partly relying on the integrity of the server(s) that you are connected to. If you have the entire blockchain, you don't have to trust anybody.
Or are you talking about the technical reason for downloading the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-01-27 06:24:13
I have been trying to recommend Coinbase because I realize that most people are coming from fractional reserve banking systems where they don't actually own their money. 
I'm not saying that with Coinbase you don't own your bitcoins, because you can still export the private keys whenever you want, but Coinbase has a lot better security than the average individual does on their computer, and I have read of many instances where they will credit you with funds if something went wrong.
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:53:26
BitPay is stifling adoption of bitcoin? So what if they don't want to do business with retailers who sell drugs. Bitcoin has already gotten a lot of bad rap on tradition media as a currency only used for drugs and hired assassins. If anything, maybe this will quiet those who deemed bitcoin as such. 
But BitPay can do whatever BitPay wants to do. The beauty of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized and even though (probably) the biggest merchant-payment processor won't do business with a certain retailer, that doesn't mean that the retailer can't still accept bitcoin. 
// I'm sorry...I literally can't find any way to word that paragraph better right now..it's been a looooong day. :/
However, I think it is important to remember the impact of BitPay for Bitcoin adoption. There are what, like over 20,000 merchants now that use BitPay to accept bitcoin? Even if you still think that this is bad, they have still done much more good than bad... 
idk...just my .02 mBTC
@_date: 2014-05-08 03:48:02
Exactly. Once Bitcoin's market cap grows, we can start to use it as a unit of account. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:47:53
I can see how you could get that from how I said it, but that's not what I was inferring. 
Bitcoin is still in its infancy. As more people start using it, the market cap will grow. As more people start using it, the value will stabilize. Idk if there is any link between market cap and volatility of a currency, but in my experience I've just seen the market cap used as like a measuring tool. 
But who knows, the effects of my college Keynesian brainwashing might be showing and I'm completely wrong haha. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:33:25

@_date: 2014-01-27 06:28:12


True, but not the only factor. OS X and Linux are UNIX-based systems and require running as 'sudo' to accomplish most important functions, and to run as 'sudo' you have to enter your password. So in that case, you would feasibly have to authorize the attack...

@_date: 2014-04-12 03:45:33
Ok i see what you're saying. Yes of course Bitcoin isn't stopping rape or malaria or giving food and shelter to those who need it. But what Bitcoin does do is tear down a huge barrier to entry for people in third world countries with hyper-inflating fiat currencies a chance to be part of a global economy that has never been accessible before.

@_date: 2014-06-12 18:49:28
Look at this from the new user standpoint...they're being told that every 10 minutes something called a 'block' is processed and that helps to confirm their transaction(s). Then after 30 minutes go by, there's still no confirmations and when a new merchant seeks help about the issue, they have to become well acquainted with poisson distribution? They're used to calling a hotline for help...not a college's library for a textbook on probability theory...
So I guess what I'm trying to ask is...will this long ( &gt; 30min) timespan between blocks always be a thing? Or will solutions ever arise that address it?
@_date: 2014-09-09 22:13:13

Yes. If I had some extra time I would set up a cold wallet but I'm just too busy right now :(
@_date: 2014-05-02 04:26:14
the reason why they require a credit card is for the mere connivence of charging the card again for extra services or damage, but Bitcoin could make it easier...especially with payment protocol implementation; which BitPay claims they're close to finishing.
Example: I book a room for one night at a rate of $179.99, but the hotel charges me $279.99 at check in..and when I check out and there were no issues or extra charges, they send me $100 to the return address sent through the payment protocol.
but making it easier would be a good business idea :P

@_date: 2014-02-20 03:24:20
nah you're fine. I'm sorry for asking..it just seems like the sub has been so contemptuous lately compared to other crypto-currency subs like hat I just wanted to make sure.
anyways, if you have a dedicated computer that is constantly running and connected to the internet, then yeah, it's definitely worth your time. But if you're on the run all the time like I am, you'll find it more convenient to run Electrum or something else that partially relies on servers to connect to the Bitcoin network. 
You don't need a 3 TB drive or anything, the blockchain is somewhere around 13 GB or so right now...and though it will get bigger over time, the prices for storage will go down. I remember back in 2009 when I bought a 250GB WD External Hard Drive with USB 2.0 connection for $99.99 and I thought it was a steal! Compare that to today where you can buy the [successor]( with 1 TB of storage &amp; USB 3.0 connection for $69.99! By the time that the blockchain gets to 3 TB, we will probably have 4 TB flash drives that sell for $9.99!
So pretty much, if you have a desktop computer, you can *easily* run a full node. And that's the beauty of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:38:46
