Stop trying to intimidate people. You're not going to prevent legal action against BFX.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:48:20
Damn right it's mine. That doesn't mean that I nor anybody else can escape favored creditor status issues in the event of a bankruptcy. socialization of losses is not a viable solution - BFX knows this. They are telling us a bed-time story.
@_date: 2016-08-19 23:28:27
Oh, please do! I'm so tired of the subterfuge here. Let's all lay our cards on the table
I'll start: Hello, my name is Matt and I had a shit ton of money seized by Bitfinex...
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:41:43
Or a gold plated coon skin cap
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:13:03
Will do, Thanks. I'll try Holden tomorrow am.
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:15:12
Exactly. Nothing left to do but try to get some justice.
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:44:44
Either identify yourself as a BFX associate or delete you account. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:24:05
See this is why we can't do business together. You've already gambled your walmart paycheck buying tokens from an insolvent company. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:55:29
Zane, Do you have a contact name, title, and phone # with the FBI Division Bitfinex is working with?
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:27:22
what a clown you are.
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:05:50
Pickles and Pate...It sounds dumb but it's actually amazing. I'd order a full course, but as you know BFX has absconded with my ETH....so there we are
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:57:39
Delete your account 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:04:29
My mistake. Well whomever he be
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:04:58
well good luck with that
@_date: 2016-08-18 16:12:24
Michael, I'm impressed with the credentials of you and your team, and I'm happy that BFX brought Ledger Labs in for the investigation. Could you offer some clarification on u/zanetackett statement?: 


Does Ledger Labs plan on performing a systems audit, financial audit or both? Can you confirm that Ledger Labs is accredited/licensed to provide a financial audit?
Do you find any conflict of interest issues in the fact that Ledger is conducting both the investigation and the audit? Do you know of any reason BFX chose not to hire one of the Big 4 to conduct a full financial audit?
Thanks

@_date: 2016-08-09 00:52:46
Let's wait for FBI, CFTC, and other relevant agencies to chime in before we call for prison sentences. It's possible that no fraud/malfeasance has occurred at BFX. But then again they did just rob us of $70 million in assets so...    
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:16:35
True I am a salty small amount holder. What is your point...there are many of us. CAL is in the works. No I don't expect to see much in the end. Nope don't care either.
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:12:21
update: straight to voice mail.
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:40:01
Understood. Problem with "socialization of loss" is that it amounts to conveyance of assets - highly illegal. Socialization guaranteed blocked, forcing BFX to seek bankruptcy protection. This means nobody will see a dime before liquidation. Why not allow users to withdraw a certain % which would not require socialization that way everybody gets to recoup something.   
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:10:02
have an up vote you shill
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:04:10
You've demonstrated nothing beyond the fact that you are woefully uniform moron with little skin in the game. Keep on shill'n, fool. Hope you can make a couple more bucks.

@_date: 2016-08-12 22:21:58
We need a way to vet these guys.
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:13:19
Don't know about inside/exit con (maybe), but I agree with your analysis on socialization. Socialization of losses = conveyance of assets. It's a no-go: BFX legal surely aware of that fact. My concern is that they will try to go forward with socialization, immediately get blocked, forcing BFX to seek bankruptcy protection. There has to be a safer way to allow all users access to some % of funds. I can't figure out why BFX wants to try 36% unless they are intent on holding on to all assets, going into bankruptcy.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:16:26
Oh well, think I got rubbing alcohol somewhere.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:57:45
Zane, Can you provide us with the name of the 3rd party entity Bitfinex is using to verify your books?
@_date: 2016-08-09 02:54:28
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:00:49
It really sounds more like meds rather than alcohol

This is getting Fun!!!
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:19:28
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:18:08
Fact of the matter is...we'll see you in court :)
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:04:54
Zane, the public bashing you are receiving will cease once you provide us access to BFX execs.
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:33:42
Which begs the question, Why do we have a 23 yr old proffered up as the sole line of communication to BFX? Where are the statements from the executive suite? Still too busy with "relevant" parties to answer our questions. Oh well, we The Irrelevants may have just wrote a $70 mill check...no big whup. I got that kind of McGilla stashed under the drivers seat of m'lambo. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:50:27
Look closely at users who are showering praise on Zane - 90% are from sketchy accounts. Not accusing BFX of sock pup'n, but I do believe that our PR guy is getting a PR treatment himself. We all feel sympathetic towards this poor 25 year old dude, typing away for 24hrs a day. By transitory property we then feel somewhat sympathetic towards BFX as well. It's a stage managed crisis response
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:09:52
So most customer funds were lost?
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:30:56
Nobody else stating to be from Bitfinex that I'm aware of. But I would appreciate it if you'd confirm that Bitfinex is not utilizing any other Reddit accounts for public relations management besides zanetackett. Whether or not posters openly state that they are Bitfinex associates.    
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:45:53
Either identify yourself as a BFX associate or delete your account. Thank You.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:56:03
LOL, the only other comment this account has is a reply to the alleged hacker, trying to get a piece of our stolen property. Let's keep it honest in here
@_date: 2016-08-10 02:43:32
Why? This only presents on opportunity for vulture funds to swoop in and buy deeply discounted debt from affected users desperate to dump. # Argentina 
@_date: 2016-08-12 19:49:06


pm me with the amount you're willing to bet. I will take you up on this if you want to put your money where your mouth is. ( I can guarantee you right now that you're completely full of shit &gt;no one who lost over $50 usd wants to sue. )
Edit: please be aware that there are thousands of us that lost $10k or more (non btc holders)
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:07:34
You're a moron. also...waiting on your pm...let's do some business
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:21:18
Knock off your B.S. bud. Hundreds of posters have new accounts. And NO, I don't accuse anybody of shilling just because they offer opposing views . This guy says that he's created a new account just so he can log in and tell Zane what a great job he is doing, &amp; how wonderful BFX compensation plan is - and he's not a shill??? This sort of crap has happened too many times now. If Bitfinex reps wish to contribute to Reddit they are welcome to do so as long as they identify themselves as BFX. My suggestion to BFX re: use of shills - STOP - STOP NOW. Thousands of people are suffering financial loss because of BFX malfeasance - show some GD respect and humility. Stop insulting us. Edit: I think it's time that I open a new sub on this topic
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:03:04
Good to hear. Is US secret service involved in this as well?
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:16:45
I'll take that as a no. You got nothing. Ah well..nice to see you working for your commodities.
@_date: 2016-08-17 00:30:25
Look, u/Todd1313 were outed as a BFX shill a few days ago...delete your account and try again...game over. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 01:13:39
Myself, so I know that's at least one. Also contacted CTFC and SEC.
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:37:27
Seriously, it's pretty obvious and people can make up their own minds about where shills pop up; I will be calling them out as I see them. I requested Zane confirm that BXF was not utilizing multiple PR accounts on Reddit  this way - he was unable to do so. I want this underhanded nonsense to stop. It's just one more abuse of our trust by BFX.
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:00:17
Don't worry pal...just had to go grab dinner...Anything else you have to say to me? knock yourself out...
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:31:47
Zane, can you disclose whether or not Bitfinex has been contacted by the hacker(s)?
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:05:04
Toddy ol' buddy! You're back at it...eh? How's the shill business treating you today? 


Still struggling to formulate a cognizant sentence I see. Well good luck to you. Say...why are you so threatened by folks seeking justice for Bitfinex? I wonder....
@_date: 2016-08-09 01:21:56
Sorry, but the only thing I've heard so far is "we'll give you a call back"
@_date: 2016-08-19 23:45:00
Poor guy, he got mixed up with the wrong crowd at such a young age
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:12:14
Nice work! At least we know this guy's no scrub.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:15:24
NY resident and US citizen!? Well then, I guess this means that you know how to use a computer. Have a cookie ;)

My mistake - point is, your CEO is not too busy to say a few words.
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:07:06
Well Todd, How many BFX tokens did you buy?
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:04:01
No worries if you don't want to answer now. I'll ask again on your next post.
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:01:25
Yes, basically 90% of posters who receive "thanks for your support" replies from Zane, are BFX shills.  We need to demand that BFX starts behaving in a forthright manner on Reddit...an apology is also in order.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:38:08
I know...that was a Hail Mary
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:59:07
Sadly, I completely agree. One chance of hope is that BFX is stalling until they can find liquidity providers able to bail them out. I've seen some rumors of this - all very vague and totally unsubstantiated. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:56:37
Bitgo: " we keep the rubber stamp industry in the biz"
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:55:18
Evidence is plain to see, I will call them out one by one as they pop up - I encourage other users to do the same. I have requested that Zane confirm that Bitfinex is not utilizing multiple reddit accounts in this manner - he is unable to do so. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:45:59
Oh m'friend you can have the bfx in my account f'freezo. it's on me bruh. Just one small detail: want my assets back. Your BFX is BS excrement. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:35:59
I presume that if/when a deal is reached with outside investors, Bitfinex will remove BFX Coins from balances and restore all missing assets. Complete restitution would be the only way to avoid litigation. I imagine,in this scenario, BFX would also need to buyback goodwill at a premium in order to retain a customer base. I suggest offering attractive trading discounts to affected users. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 22:33:56
This strikes me as insanely irresponsible.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:59:52
Well, I may be broke so I hope that it's cheap. I'm in a White Lightning mood
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:25:54
Understood. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:18:54
What's with the trolls... Are they in on this?
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:43:40
I'm not sure about that. If we are offered a % of our money back sans waiver, I would probably be OK with that. If however BFX steals from me to pay Paul back - Hell No!
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:28:16
Thanks, I saw that. I have been making calls here in the states to CFTC and FBI. No success, as of yet, in speaking with an agent of either organization. Calls to the CFTC in NY will get you to a live operator, who will transfer you to the voice mail of one Trevor Cokel (sic?) . I have left several messages.646-746-9700
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:01:18
Zane just get Phil to tweet out few words like " No I am not on the run, I'm here in (X country) handling shit." Sheesh man, it takes 2 seconds. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:25:20
I did not say that everyone with negligible karma was a throwaway hacker lotto account; Elysianbaws account is, that's pretty clear. A number of these jokers have popped up on Reddit.  They seem to have an agenda in promoting BFX Coin. Possible money laundering agenda or to prey upon BFX token holders. I don't know
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:19:18
Nice find on the contact.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:19:24
I think criminal malfeasance is far more likely than an inside job. One does not simply sign over $70 Million - no questions asked. That lil' oopsy  is prison-worthy ipso-facto.  
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:28:23


LOL. You are truly entertaining. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:39:20
Probably none.
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:29:44
Bashco, will you say whether or not you have any affiliation whatsoever with Bitfinex or Ifinex?
@_date: 2016-08-19 21:06:48
He's lying low today, hoping the tough questions will go away.
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:53:10
Good luck in the hacker lotto. You complete and utter douche.
@_date: 2016-08-12 22:30:53
They did us a favor by seizing our assets? how?
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:54:09
I understand his purpose completely. If BFX PR had hundreds of people demanding answers from the execs we might see some results. The other big stick up my ass: BFX persistent use of trolls/shills. Zane has failed to definitively confirm that BFX is not using undercover PRM to influence Reddit.   
@_date: 2016-08-09 23:54:11
Update: received call back from Trevor @ CFTC. Not a whole lot of info to relay. In short: 
 * The CFTC has received a number of complaints regarding Bitfinex situation, and we are looking into the matter.
* Bitfinex IS NOT registered with the CFTC as a legitimate CFM.      "That's why we fined them $75K..."
* Me: "Does the CFTC view BXF 'socialized loss' scheme as unlawful?"
Trevor: ' It would be gravely irresponsible for me to provide you with an answer to that question. This is a matter for the commissioners to decide.'
* The CFTC currently has no plans to take any emergency actions against Bitfinex.
* The CFTC has no plans to release a press statement, short term, regarding our position on the Bitfinex situation. However, It is possible that one of the commissioners may make an unofficial statement to the press.
* We can not provide you with any details about the ongoing situation.
I will try to post a more indepth subreddit.
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:59:53
Shill for BTX token. Ignore his comments
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:49:15
Zane, If you're still there, can we get a sign of life from BFX?  No contact for 11hrs. How long before we all acknowledge that BFX has closed up shop? 
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:12:49
I propose that we first milk this wretched cow for every cent it will cough up, only then do we shoot it and make soup with the bones.   
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:46:14
Hard to tell if it was an inside job or not. Some folks are "reading between the lines" of PGP's lattest comments, suggesting that attack may have occurred from someone at the server site. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:47:58
I'd like to know the same: Where's my paycheck BFX?
@_date: 2016-08-12 19:54:03
I held ETH/ETC. Where's my bailout??? My assets were seized
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:10:32
Again...I received no bailout. My assets were seized to cover large btc account holders. what's your point. You're just making an ass of yourself. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 22:27:03
The kettle says what?
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:49:51
Agreed. Good to hear something substantial out of Phil, tipsy or not. It was also somewhat comforting that he came across as genuine.
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:01:25
still shill'n I see. Did you win the hacker lotto yet? 
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:33:06
Zane, I'd like to repeat my request: Can you please confirm that Bitfinex has not utilized any other Reddit accounts, for public relations purposes, whereby the user/poster has not identified him/herself as an associate or representative of Bitfinex or ifinex?
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:32:06
Thanks Zane, I recommend viewing post history when something looks fishy. They're using simple alpha-numeric user accounts, overly solicitous towards you, and are pushing BFX Coin for some reason.
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:13:40
You forgot 3 zeros.
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:51:33
We should start to see more info on this in the coming days. There are already some posts seeking crowd sourcing for legal fees. Hopefully BFX will get it's act together, and return our assets once they've secured new capital. I'm in the same boat. I cannot believe Phil Potter et al would risk criminal prosecution like this. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 02:47:57
Zane, Will BFX open trading before securing an agreement with new investors?
@_date: 2016-08-19 21:13:02
What evidence do you have which links to another exchange?
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:46:08
Have to disagree with you. BFX can't afford to tie up liquid assets in margin trading. IMO, they need to reserve what's left for WC. Gotta keep those lights on. More importantly, it's unbelievably sketch to be taking money from margin traders right now. I haven't checked if they're offering leverage on BFX token, but if they are, Phil has officially lost his effing mind. Bunker-Hitler stuff.
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:04:18
Step in the right direction? How many BFX tokens did you buy? I'd imagine that you would want them to stay in business long enough to secure new investors, yes? This is a bunker Hitler move.   
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:23:32
You are absolute trash.
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:25:24


As have I
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:49:36
Anybody else suspect that this attack was politically motivated?
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:07:19
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:34:42
I think that he's justifiably insulted by underhanded PRM. Neither the time nor the place
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:58:46
Something to be aware of: It appears that BFX is utilizing  multiple Reddit accounts for public relations purposes without disclosing that these posters are in fact Bitfinex associates. caveat emptor
@_date: 2016-08-17 00:27:51
Agreed. It's about seeking justice now. u/Todd1313, fails to understand this.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:29:25
Zane please confirm this.
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:54:17
Zane, Would you please confirm how many Bitfinex associates are posting on Reddit?
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:19:46
Cute. Have an upvote.
@_date: 2016-08-19 20:43:11


A share of our 36% would be my guess
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:41:37
Do you have any source to suggest that BFX is in talks with potential liquidity providers?  Would be fantastic if true - For years I've been hunting bigfoot for same reason.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:37:13


Look Bub, You must be new here. This has been discussed over and over again on reddit, media ect. Do your research and get up to speed. If you still want to invest in BFX, great. But don't risk more than you can afford to lose. BFX is not the next big pump and dump. You're boring me now. GL, seriously. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:56:51
Jeez, If you making so much on BFX tokens, you should hire someone to shill pro te. That way you won't need to make yourself look like such a pathetic clown. Sweet dreams bud.
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:20:36
I think the best short term option for BFX would be: Give account holders a % of their money back sans "socialization of losses."  Even if socialization was an acceptable option ( it's definitely not IMO) BFX will certainly be prevented from releasing funds in this manner due to conveyance issues. Therefore, socialized 36% loss by no means gets our funds back any faster.  
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:26:42
The only acceptable answer to my question would have been for Zane to confirm that Bitfinex is not currently using undercover PRM to post on Reddit.  Zane has made no such confirmation of this, because BFX is in fact engaged in such manipulation. I have called for the use of shills to stop immediately. I will continue to call attention to shills if they continue. ( I can attest to the fact that I have one and only one Reddit account) 
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:20:25
Thanks, we will have fun being salty! Have fun trying to redeem your BFX after receivership.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:51:42
Is there any evidence to back claims that stolen Bitfinex Bitcoin has been dumped into ETC? If so how would this affect other exchanges?
@_date: 2016-08-12 19:31:35
How much money are you willing to bet? I'll take it!
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:46:38
Well I've seen enough: time to get crazy drunk.
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:43:23


The hack targeted large accounts. Whales received a bailout from small fish holding less than 100k.
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:10:46
Nope. Any who....If you don't throw something clever at me soon, I'm off to bed...I'll continue shill bashing tomorrow. Amaze me bud
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:13:51
Zane, please stop responding to throwaway accounts that were created to illicit stolen BTC from "BFX hacker."You've done this several times now - it's extremely insulting. Elysianbaws has exactly 1 Karma point, and a post listing his wallet address. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:37:12
I'm not an optometrist so I can't assist you with your myopia, YES it is plain to see. Shills are evident on BFX subs. You may look at my overview to see those that I've called out. Again I repeat my request for Zane to confirm that Bitfinex is not using multiple unidentified BFX Reddit accounts for PRM purposes.
