Your little post is entirely about the comparison between the current price and some arbitrary date of one month ago.  I zoomed out to compare price performance since the split, for a more complete and less selective view.
If I *wanted* to be selective like you are, I could have chosen to compare today's price with that of 20th December.  From that date, BCH is "holding its value" to the point of dropping by about 33% to date, while the BTC drop is only about 22%.
But that's not my style. :)

Send your bitcoin to a new address, to keep them safe. Your BCash will still be at the old address.
Import the old address into a BCash wallet. Coinomi can be good for this.
Within coinomi, you can use changelly or shapeshift to convert your BCash to Bitcoin.

They're just responsible for their contribution to the software and the protocol.
What anyone does with it, and what jurisdiction they come under is another thing.  Yet another thing is how difficult it can be made to identify who is responsible for operating a node.
I don't know what Fincen will make of it, but one of the goals of Bitcoin is censorship resistance.  That is, allowing two people to exchange funds, regardless of who might prefer they didn't, so if Bitcoin is going to achieve that goal, there will be inevitable conflicts with regulators along the way.

I've got to say that what you're saying is about the most rational outlook for BCash I've heard.
I still fear for the centralisation of the coin, and I have a strong distaste for the people at that centre. I think that the decentralisation vector of block size increases is something that ought to be actively opposed rather than facilitated.
I don't think I'll ever be a fan of BCash, but what you're outlining could save it from inevitable failure that would come from the Amish-like rejection of anything that wasn't written in the White Paper.

@_date: 2018-01-24 16:18:46
There are umpteen out there. I'm not going to recommend one, you can do your own research to find one you like, but here's one to look at: 
You nominate a Trust Agent to act as the third party to a 2 of 3 multisig wallet.  You fund the transaction to the seller, who doesn't get paid until 2/3 signatures release the funds.  So, if your ordered product arrives as expected, you and the seller can directly complete the transaction.  If there's a dispute, your Trust Agent makes the decision.  
One thing that's different you can choose your trust agent, some of whom have high profiles in the industry and are unlikely to want to damage their reputation by ripping you off.   Following on from that, if you don't like the decision of a trust agent, you can choose a different one the next time.  You don't get that with PayPal, where you have no say in who your arbitrator will be.  Yet another difference is that you get to decide when you want to use this service instead of just paying directly, so it's not like you're paying a service charge on every transaction to make the service available.
So, like much of everything to do with Bitcoin, it comes down to personal responsibility and choice.

The teachings of Satoshi are contained not only in the scroll itself but also in his online postings.
The high priests of BCash take some of them as absolute truths  and discard others. Things that are not mentioned at all by Him are either completely acceptable (eg mining pools) or complete heresy (tiered architecture). Once an arbitrary decision has been handed down on these things, they are added to the Vision ^TM, just as sacrosanct as if He Himself had spoken. 
It's a tiered dogma... Tier 1 is the scroll. Tier 2, His other writings. Tier 3, the rulings of the High Priests.

I was just responding to your question, with your assumption.
The more transactions that move off chain, the less competition there will be for onchain space, so that will be a downward pressure on transaction fees.

**Today** not a hope.  It would take a couple of months to go through a hard fork to increase blocksize, to get all the ecosystem reconfigured and running any new code to handle the new blocksize.  And that's assuming that the network would even accept the changes.

If you're talking about using your PC for mining, that's not the route to financial independence.  You'll need to buy specialist dedicated ASIC miners, which are in pretty limited supply.


It's hard to nail this down as a specific requirement.  Mining is competitive.  You will be one of many people trying to be first to solve the block puzzle.  If you're unlucky, you could try a gazillion times and never be first.  You might be second a gazillion times, but there's no prize for second.  
That's why mining pools exist, to spread any wins across the pool.  You might be in a pool of 10,000 miners, and you might never win, but if any of the other 9,999 does you potentially get a cut.  And if you do win, your reward is shared with the others.  Effectively, you have a greater chance to win, but the prize is smaller.
To have any chance at all of a solo return at all, I would imagine that you need a substantial up-front investment in the order of tens of thousands of dollars, and even then miners are selling out faster than they can be bought currently.  
Top end mining equipment is currently only waitlisted, with none available.  Prices per unit are in the $2-3k range, with power consumption of maybe 1 - 1.5 kW.  I supsect you'd need a few of these to go solo.
But for more informed opinion, you could try the good people at @_date: 2018-01-23 09:44:59

Anyone with two or more channels can be a node. Someone else running a node with 5, 10 or even a million channels isn't going to influence my decision to run a node to assist the network, just like I currently run a Bitcoin node.
This isn't like mining where there's an arms race centralising hashpower, where someone else's warehouses of ASIC mining rigs makes me using spare GPU capacity for mining pointless.
So I still don't really get your concern.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:16:54
Mining fee for onchain transactions is based on the size of the transaction and supply and demand when the transaction is created. There's no reliable way to predict what a transaction fee will be.
What we do know is that it's possible to increase supply (how many transactions can fit in a block) through things like Segwit, Schnorr and others. Simultaneously, demand for onchain transactions is being reduced through second tier solutions like the Lightning network.

I was asking a simple question, rather than making a point.
But if you want to [compare](  Dash seems to have jumped over the past couple of months to about 14,000 transactions/day while Bitcoin is doing 350,000.  
Will Dash approach those levels?
And of course, Bitcoin's share of market cap is dropping.  When you start off at 100%, being the original, the only way is down as more coins are launched.  It's not really a very useful statistic.
Again, the question above is not rhetorical.  I don't know what Dash will do.  I was just genuinely curious to see which alts were being referenced in OP's headline.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:59:49
But you said it showed we could have 1GB blocks today. We can't. You said it wouldn't lead to centralisation. It would.
You've every right to be sceptical about any innovation. There are lots of alts out there with a lot of different approaches. You can use any of them.  If Lightning delivers what many of us think it will, you can always come back when it's proven.

That's what Bitcoin does. The rate of increase halves every 4 years. In any system, once the rate of increase is set to decrease over time, the increases will decrease towards zero, setting a limit beyond which the number will not go.
It's like the allegorical flea standing at one end of a 1 meter ruler. He will keep jumping towards the other end of the ruler. Each jump covers half the distance left. So his first jump is 50cm. His next jump, 25cm... and so on.  
Theoretically, he would keep jumping forever and never reach the end, with jumps becoming infinitely small, and the distance remaining becoming equally small. And that's what happens to the mining reward.

If you have the transaction ID, someone might be able to offer an informed opinion.
The fee is a function of the size of your transaction (number of bytes, not related to the value) and the urgency with which you want it sent.
I've no idea when "last night" was for you, but about 12 hours ago, transactions with a fee of 70 sat/byte were clearing.  If your transaction was a standard 1 input, 2 output of about 250 bytes, that would equate to a charge of 0.00017500 BTC, or about **$2.38** at the then value of Bitcoin.
If you paid 14 times as much, it means that your transaction was about 14 times the size (possible, but unlikely) or whoever estimated the fees on your behalf completely overestimated them (possible).  or it might be a little of both.

I'm not conflating them.  I understand the difference.  Although, yeah, I didn't express it very well.
The point is that the protocol is ready right now, today, live on mainnet to handle many more transactions per block than are being put into the block.  The number of transactions is not constrained to current levels by the protocol as implemented.

I was correcting a couple of your errors / misdirections.
It wasn't the Bitcoin development team that tried to impose S2X. It was one guy, basically, developing a contentious hard fork. The Bitcoin development team opposed it, while it was backed by miners.
Even though miners and the (one man) development team were in agreement that, contrary to your other assertion, was not sufficient to change the Bitcoin protocol. Without the support of validating nodes, the blocks mined by miners in compliance with Jeff Garzik's code, would be dropped from the network.
Now we can add a third one to the list. In the runup to the proposed S2X activation date, nodes that would reject it vastly outnumbered those in support.
All of which was just as well really, seeing as how the code didn't work.
And there's even a fourth one we can add to your list. Segwit predated S2X. So those of us who support greater Segwit adoption are not some latecoming latent big blockers. Segwit is about optimising the block data structure so that more transactions can fit in a block. It's also why we now refer to block weight instead of block size.

Bitcoin and blockchains can be considered separate, you've already given the examples of other cryptocurrencies that use their own blockchains.
A blockchain is, at its core, a distributed immutable record of events, with an agreed ruleset on how it can be updated.  It may be public or it may be private.  There are active efforts to find useful applications for blockchains.

Most likely, it's just a shared server.  I'm just surprised by how low the count is.  Usually, a scam site is just a small site on a cheap shared server, which has hundreds of other small sites on it.
I was just checking in case the scammer had rented a server and hosted multiple sites on it.  Happens sometimes :)

No disrespect, but when you have questions about something you heard someone say, that's probably the person you should ask...
When you have a channel open on LN you can send payments to/from that channel so long as the channel has capacity. Let's say Alice opens a channel with Bob for .01 Bitcoin, with Alice putting up all the funds. Over however many transactions Alice can now send .01 BTC to/through Bob, until Bob owns all .01 BTC on the channel.  Maybe then Alice does some work for Frank. Frank can then send .01 BTC to Alice through Bob and now Alice owns all the .01 BTC in her channel with Bob and she can spend it again.

There is nothing to stop governments issuing their own blockchain currency.
A few governments have already started making noises along these lines.
For me, I don't get why a government would want to go the blockchain route.  If you want centralised control of transaction processing and the number of currency units in circulation, it would probably be faster, easier and cheaper to build this on more traditional architecture -- especially if you're minded to be nice to the banks.
If you want control over supply, and want to be able to enforce identity control on each account, and want to be able to control who can trade with whom, etc etc... the last thing you probably want is a distributed system.

I don't think you understand how fees work. It doesn't matter how long those transactions were waiting, if you offered just a little more, your transaction would still have been included.
So, by your own admission, there were plenty of transactions that got into that block without paying as much as you did. So what you say you paid was not 'the lowest fee' to get into that block.  You overpaid then and you're misrepresenting now.
Or maybe you've made it all up. I dunno.

How much you need to explain to people will vary, and generally reduces over time, even as the underlying technology matures.
There are a lot of people who can drive a car without knowing too much about what goes on under the hood.  They can send an email without knowing how HTTPS encrypts their content as it moves from the browser to the server, or how the mail protocol wraps it all up, or how the mail gets routed through various servers, or the underlying network technology that supports the whole thing.
Lighting wallets are easy to use. Scanning a payment QC code is easy.  The hard part is looking up from your phonr quickly enough to see the starblocks page update to "paid".
Anyone who has a desire to dig deeper into the technology can find plenty of resources out there to do it.

Apologies, you're right.  I should have said 50 sat / byte.
I don't have details of any particular transactions, I'm just reading off the charts [here](  It has bumped a little in the past hour, but you can see I'm not far off.  There are people paying vastly higher fees, but there's no need for them to do so.
In fact, reading from those charts, there are 97,122 transactions in the pool, with a total pending transaction fee of 35.306 BTC.  So the *average* transaction fee in the pool now is 0.00036352216 BTC or approx $4.72 - and that's across all transaction sizes.
I'm not saying it's all rosy, but the figures you quoted originally are way beyond what is necessary - and are probably coming from dodgy fee estimation in wallets/exchanges - rather than anything actually required by Bitcoin itself.

Nah. It would take a dent, sure. But most Bitcoiners live outside the US where the laws would have no impact. Within the US, the sheer impossibility of getting between most Bitcoiners and their stash, and the impossibility of stopping them sending their coins to whereever they like, would be a powerful demonstration of censorship resistance. This would likely cause a surge in interest in bitcoin in other democratically challenged parts of the world.  On and off ramps might be a temporary challenge, but I'm sure some enterprosing individuals would find a way around that.

That's one possible cause, sure.
It's also possible that some big source of transactions has started batching them.  Given how suddenly the decline started on January 19/20th, that seems far more likely to me.
It's also possible that a sustained spam attack stopped, although you could argue that that's just a special case of "people stopped using it".
Either of these makes more sense to me, when you consider how Bitcoin's price has been moving in that period.  There's a lot of buying and selling going on.
I would suggest that there is plenty of room for speculation, and that your conclusion is not the only one, and seems the least likely one to be the major factor.

It's just hard to demonstrate that something isn't possible when that "something" is undefined.
Channels are created with on-chain transactions.  These specify the value (number of Bitcoins) in the channel.  The only thing that changes after that is how that number of coins is split between the participants on the channel, and they both have to agree on that.

Most of the problems you have mentioned aren't problems.
The only one problem that is still on the books is that someone *might* convince marks to open up a channel with them, even though they nothing about each other, and *might* try to broadcast a stale commitment, and *might* do it when the counter party is somehow unable to detect it and *might* be able to do this often enough to eventually succeed while they can still con people into creating a channel with them.
It could happen, but it's going to be a small minority.  Just like fraud in cash transactions, or transactions with any other payment method.  Presenting this as the reason that "Lightning will not work", is just FUDing.
There are solutions, like I have mentioned.  Who ever is operating a node, be it an individual or a service provider like an exchange, needs to operate it according to decent security standards.  As an individual, I could run two or three nodes all watching out for each other.  Or I could create a circle with family and friends watching out for each other.  A service provider already ought to have redundant failover systems in place to ensure that their nodes stay online.
You've made up the notion of a massive public bounty database, and then point to it and say it's a bad thing because it will know everything about every transaction. 
First off, why isn't that more of an argument against a public blockchain which is already public?
But, as regards Lightning, as I have already explained, even if you do invite a particular third party to monitor for expired commitments on your channel, that person does not know "everything".  They don't know the value of your channel.  They don't know who your cheating counterparty is. 
Even as a channel participant, I don't know everything about the transactions on my channel, thanks to the privacy in the layers of the Lightning protocol.

But if a closed source, centralised, premined coin aimed mainly at inter bank exchanges somehow eclipses the notion of decentralised coins, then it would represent a massive failure for the people.

Nodes verify that blocks meet the rules.
If a miner adopts some new ruleset but the majority of nodes reject that ruleset, then they will reject his blocks.  This is what gives regular users control over the coin.  Even though there was relatively strong miner consensus for Segwit2X, the majority of nodes opposed it.  This is why the main S2X proponents backed down and called off the fork.
Without those nodes, the S2X fork would have gone ahead with no more justification than the miners wanted it.  I don't want that to be the basis for decision making.

Who knows what will happen in the future.  But right now, alts are very closely tied to the big swings of Bitcoin.  
Most of the news/rumours/events that trigger big swings in Bitcoin apply to the overall crypto space.
With the possible exceptions of Ripple and Ethereum, I don't think any of the alts have done enough to win a lot of mainstream attention in their own right as anything other than "just another crypto" - most people know nothing about most of them except that the unit price is far less than that of Bitcoin.

People are scrabbling like crazy to find new grounds to fud Bitcoin, now that transaction times and prices are about to come crashing down.
There are over 300 developers on the Bitcoin github project. I believe that 2 have commit access. This makes sense because when you've got a system that represents hundreds of billions of dollars of user funds, you want controls in place over the code. 
The two who have commit access (that I am aware of) are Wladimir and Jonas  - from MIT and DigitalBitbox respectively. 
Marco from Chaincode left the role this year.
Those who complain about centrslisation in development seem to simultaneously claim that the few committers have all the control and that Blockstream (which has no Bitcoin committer) have all the control.
This makes no sense.

This is partly the funny bit.  Despite some of the more vociferous advocates of BCash running multiple conspiracy theories about the evils of Bitcoin, they still run practically all of the code on their alt.
They don't have segwit, so the coin is subject to transaction malleability and ASICBoost.
They changed the block size limit.
They implemented replay protection.
They added EDA.
And they later got rid of EDA in favour of some other minerbait.

Perhaps you need to define what you mean by "transacting node".  You've paraphrased this as "exchange nodes and merchant nodes".
But, of course, these are not the only entities running transactions.  Every wallet transacts.  And while some people may chose to use the node provided by their wallet provider, others of us use our own full nodes.  This is how we ensure the trustless nature of Bitcoin.  I am not relying on anyone else to validate blocks for me, and I don't have to trust them to use the best rules.  My wallet is connected to my own node, and I validate blocks myself.  
The more people who do this, the better it is for Bitcoin as a trustless, peer to peer system, and not a centralised service.
You're right in that you could spin up a whole ton of AWS nodes that don't actually serve anyone.  Oddly enough, this exact thing happened with nodes that supported S2X suddenly appearing on AWS in the run up to that fork date, and then just as suddenly disappearing when it was called off.  These nodes likely served no purpose other than count.  However, the other nodes remained, just like mine.  And mine is being used to validate transactions.  Not just by me, but by those who choose to use it.
If you have been running a node, but haven't made it available to others and haven't connected your own wallet to it, then maybe you are in a different situation.  But in that case, I would ask why don't you actually use your node instead of shutting it down?  That's how you would support the principles of Bitcoin and how you would take power back to the people, and by sharing it with others you are securing the network not just for yourself, but for others too.

Transactions at 50 sat / k are now clearing.  For a standard 250 byte transaction, that's a network fee of about **$1.64** at current values.  A whole lot less than the fee you imagine.
If you're paying more than that, you might want to change your wallet or whatever.  While you're at it, change to a segwit wallet for even cheaper transactions.

I'm saying that no matter how you bold it, it can't be done today.
So the question becomes what we should be doing for the coming months. For me, I see the priorities as getting more wallets and exchanges supporting the already existing Segwit, getting Lightning out the door. That will put us in a much better place than even these gigabyte blocks can claim.
Incidentally, I believe that Stanford was using 4 core CPU's  with 16 GB RAM and SSD's for their dedicated nodes. That's way in excess of what a lot of current nodes have allocated, whether they be pi's or multi purpose PC's where the node software is just a background process on a PC doing multiple other tasks.  So there's an immediate centralising effect right there.
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:23:22

Shared as in reachable, allowing incoming connections from outside your local network.  You can confirm this by searching for your node on: 
Once your node is reachable and has incoming connections, then it is playing a few important roles.
First off, it is validating blocks and transactions against its favoured ruleset. 
Secondly, it is propagating these validated blocks to/from the other nodes it is connected with. 
Thirdly, it may be disconnecting nodes with a history of sending invalid blocks.
So, even if your node is not processing transactions on your behalf,  it ought to be part of the ongoing propagation of blocks throughout the network.
Transactions or no, if your node is active on the network, it is propagating transactions that it deems valid.  This contributes both to the speed and security of the network when it comes to block propagation. 
Without RPC, you're not transacting for anyone else, but that's fine.  There's still a point in running the node, as described above.  
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:10:55
Umm... perhaps you missed the point.  I was saying that the appearance of more low fee transactions in the mempool charts doesn't necessarily mean a flood of new low-fee transactions, just that with the number of high fee transactions declining, more low fee transactions will fit in whatever size you have set your mempool to be.

Show me how you think he could do that?
Every update to the distribution of funds in a channel requires both parties to sign it, or it's not valid and it never happened.
The only way he could present evidence that you were defrauding the channel is if you broadcast an onchain event with a signed transaction (signed by both of you) claiming it represents the current state of the channel, and he responds by broadcasting a more recent signed transaction (signed by both of you) showing a different state.
That would make it look like you were attempting to misrepresent the state of the channel.  It would look like that, because you were.

1. Install the Eclair testnet wallet on your phone
2. find a testnet faucet to send test bitcoins to your wallet
3. Open a channel using some of your coins.  This is the slowest step as you have to wait for this transaction to be included in a block, which can take an hour or two on testnet
4.  Go to starblocks and select a refreshing coffee.  Checkout as far as the QR code.
5. go to pay in your wallet. Open the QR reader, but don't point it at you computer screen yet.
6. get any blinking you need to do done. You need your eyes wide open now
7. scan the qr code and hold your phone so you can see it and your computer screen
8.  confirm payment on your phone.  gasp at how quickly the starblocks checkout acknowledges receipt.

You seem to be arguing against yourself. In this comment, you acknowledge that people can be tempted to pay higher fees when there is high demand for block inclusion.

Not just any development team.  The **Bitcoin** development team.  But go on then.  Show me where you got your assessment that the Bitcoin community was 90% in agreement with S2X.  
Not even the proposers of S2X claimed that.  Remember they said they backed off because they *failed* to achieve consensus?


How much of the koolaid do you drink?  You were sounding so rational earlier.  The Bitcoin = Blockstream mantra doesn't stand up to any analysis of the, you know, facts.  [Here are those facts]( from a comment I posted in The Big Block approach is block size increases have no downside because they only reduce the number of nodes, and (depending on the depth of the Big Blocker's conviction) nodes are either pointless or harmful.  Citizens, they feel, have no need to be peers in the peer to peer network - leave that stuff to the miners.  Let the miners not only use the rules when creating blocks, but let them create the rules too, and validate that they are using the rules that they created.  Let mere users be consumers of this centralised service.  It's a perfectly sound model, which has served banking for a long time.  The only difference, really, is that it's like banking without regulation, with more and more control moving to Jihan Wu's corporation.  Forgive me if I don't buy into that.

It's not just about downloading 1mb or 2mb, or 8mb in the case of BCash.
It's about the impact it has on how many people can run a full node so as to be a peer in this peer to peer network.
To run a full node, you must first download the entire blockchain.  Then, when you're all caught up, you must download, validate and be ready to distribute each new block within the 10 minute average block period. 
The bigger the block, the longer it takes to download and the longer it takes to process to validate every transaction in the block.
All of this combines to raise the bar required in order to run a node, centralising the validation function, forcing more users to trust someone else to do the validation for them.
Without your own node, your Bitcoin experience is neither trustless nor peer-to-peer.  When too many people fall into that situation, you kiss goodbye to "decentralised" as well.  At that point, what is left of Bitcoin?

Satoshi made his original announcement via email on a cryptography mailing list 9 years ago, and posted the source to sourceforge.net.
Satoshi's email provider, Vistomail, is/was a privacy-centred operation, so it seems unlikely that they have a record of who used what IP to connect to their service yesterday, let alone 9 years ago.
Just from a data volume perspective it would seem unlikely that sourceforge has that level of detail from almost a decade ago either.
But just for the sake of argument, let's imagine that one of these has the wherewithal to produce his IP address on demand.  There are still issues with connecting that to an individual.  Let's even assume that it's easy to see what organisation was assigned that address 9 years ago, just to get that out of the way.
1.  The owning organisation might be an ISP, but may not have 9 years of IP address assignment logs, or maybe the ISP has ceased to exist.
2.  The owning organisation might be a network provider who leased it to another organisation which happens to be a privacy-minded VPN operator who doesn't keep logs.
3.  The address might be traced to some shared service like an internet cafe, library, university, company, etc... and maybe that entity and its data have gone out of existence.
And even to ask these questions, with any expectation of an answer, you would likely be battling with data privacy restrictions in multiple jurisdictions, meaning that even if the information is available no-one is going to share the information with "someone".

It's a network. You don't need to open a channel with everyone you want to pay. So long as you have a channel open with someone on the network, and the person you want to pay does, then there will be routes your payment can take. 
If you choose to open two channels, one with Alice and one with Bob, you can now be part of the network routing. Say Andy has a channel with Alice and Betty has a channel with Bob. You can now send .01 BTC to Bob and Betty, which sends .02 of your channel value to Bob. If Betty wants to send .02 BTC to Andy, that payment can be routes through you, so that the 0.02 is added to your share of your channel with Bob and removed from your share of your channel with Alice.
And so value flows to and fro through your channels.
Talk of funds being 'locked up' doesn't make sense to me in thia context. It's like saying your fiat is 'locked up' when you take some cash out at the ATM.  Sure, you can't send your now paper dollars electronically but you can still spend them anywhere that accepts paper money.

How much you need to explain to people will vary, and generally reduces over time, even as the underlying technology matures.

They can send an email without knowing how HTTPS encrypts their content as it moves from the browser to the server, or how the mail protocol wraps it all up, or how the mail gets routed through various servers, or the underlying network technology that supports the whole thing.
Lighting wallets are easy to use. Scanning a payment QC code is easy.  The hard part is looking up from your phonr quickly enough to see the starblocks page update to "paid".

Nothing unfortunate at all.  I'm glad you took the opportunity to take a read.


Indeed, he cited them as an option in the sacred white paper.  And there's nothing wrong with SPV wallets. I have one on my phone.  Let's take the opportunity to review what he said in the section on SPV white paper:


network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain**, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in.
My SPV connects to my node, and that's how I satisfy myself as to the validity of the chain.  If you don't use your own node, how many different nodes does your SPV connect to in order to satisfy itself?  Do you know?  Do you know which nodes these are?  Did you select them?  Or is this all part of the process which you trust someone else to do for you?
The Bitcoin design does indeed support users just being users, however it doesn't try to coerce them into that position.  Satoshi referred to "the rest" being nodes that "don't generate".  That's the full nodes, I'm referring to.  Not mining nodes that generate blocks, but nodes that propagate transactions and blocks. 


I've no idea.  It's up to everyone to make their own choice.  The important thing is to make that choice available to and attainable for as many people as possible who want to.


Does making up numbers help you to convince yourself?  Cause it doesn't do anything to convince anyone else.  There are currently 11,814 Bitcoin nodes actively accepting requests from other nodes.  There's no real way to tell how many other nodes there are that just validate transactions *without* propagating the network.  
Those who don't run their node are probably just as much at risk of doublespend as are users of any other third party service, like PayPal, or Visa.  But the point of Bitcoin is that we shouldn't need to rely on those trusted intermediaries.
I'd far rather rather be a peer on the peer to peer network of Bitcoin, than a consumer of the services offered by a peer.


There's quite a few on Any transaction that isn't recorded individually on the blockchain is anathema to them.  I know.  I've had the arguments.


Ver has said many things, frequently contradictory.  In [this exchange about a year ago]( he said that he looked forward to SegWit, but didn't see it as a priority compared to block size increase.  Yet on August first, when he created BCash, he made sure that SegWit was not included in his fork.  At that point, Segwit was not some vapourware.  It was live tech and he could have kept it while increasing the blocksize in BCash.  But he preferred to get rid of it.  Doesn't make much sense if he was looking forward to it.


Lightning, of course, would be *worse* on BCash as it stands because of the transaction malleability bug.  This is not an issue for Bitcoin, as SegWit removed this issue.  But unless and until BCash fixes it, then Lightning would most certainly be *worse* on BCash.


That doesn't stack up with what actually happened.  Again, BCash could have been launched with Segwit as well as Big Blocks.  The code was already live on the Bitcoin chain.  But BCash proudly removed it.  In the process, removing an existing enabling layer for second tier solutions.  Some BCashers appear to have accepted the inevitability of these technologies and so are busy rewriting history to pretend that they were for it all along.


It's demonstrably true.  BCash is an alt.  One of many hundreds that copy/pasted the Bitcoin code and made the changes it regarded as best.  It is, in simple fact, just another alt.  Yet is the only one which is so unsure of its technical merits that it focuses so much more on an appeal to authority as the "real Bitcoin".  The one that Satoshi would have wanted.
I notice you ignored my last point. The one where Satoshi, at the end of the White Paper, allowed for the Bitcoin rules to be changed through consensus.  Perhaps the surest rejection of Satoshi's principles is BCash's rejecting that, and insisting that consensus rules are *not* the way to change Bitcoin.
At the end, I get that you prefer BCash, and don't care too much for decentralisation, peer-to-peer or trustlessness.  You value whatever else you found in the White Paper, that you feel is still reflected in BCash.  I'm damned if I can see what that might be, but it's your choice.
Just know that whatever your "ideological" interpretation is, it's in the minority, and to try to state it as fact doesn't do credit to your intellectual honesty.

On July 31st 2017, the day before the BCash fork, Bitcoin was trading at somewhere in the region of $2,700.  
Now, a little over 5 months later, BCash is trading at about $2,400, and Bitcoin is trading at about $14,700.
I'm happy with my choice.  Are you?
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:09:20
Let me guess.  You think that blocks can't be bigger than 1 MB, right?
Bitcoin has already processed blocks of greater than 1.6 MB, and it could potentially go to twice that or more, if only users (and particularly exchanges etc) upgraded to Segwit.
The facility is there in the Bitcoin protocol right there as it stands today.  We're just waiting for users, wallets and exchanges to upgrade.

I don't know how you assessed the opinions of the "vast majority of its current and potential users".  Did you, perhaps, just make that up?
BCash was forked specifically to have increased block sizes and no segwit.  Did the "vast majority" of Bitcoin users heave a sigh of relief and rush to that coin?  Nope.
And not only did they not do so, BCash's bigger blocks has already experienced [a period of mempool congestion]( just a week ago, and barely reached past [1,000 transactions per block]( in that period, when Bitcoin's blocks were processing more transactions.

There are lots of networks of companies experimenting with blockchain solutions.  Typically, the environment you need is a network of companies with a need to share data, and a defined set of rules on who can update what and who can see what.  This makes it a trusted network, rather than an untrusted network, and does away with the need for miners.  Instead, updates can be done according to the rules of the system, defined by the parties to the system.

Whether or not it would be a good system is probably not worth discussing with you, though. Partly because it seems unlikely that enough miners would have enough interest, partly because it sets a minimum price on transactions, partly because it makes it cheaper to spam the network, but mostly because the chip on your shoulder would be annoying to deal with.

**You** don't have to be online.  **Your node** does.  If you run your own node, like a good decentralised peer, then how you manage that is up to you.  
If you use the node of some service provider, then shop around and find one that guarantees the uptime you need.
Additionally, you can take precautions like being careful about who you open payment channels with, etc
All basic hygiene.
There are people who can rip you off in all walks of life.  Lightning has some good systems in place to protect you, but you've also got to take responsibility for your own safety.  That's the nature of a peer-to-peer system. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:35:29
I'll skip over your use of the word "hub", and try to phrase the question using the actual component of the Lightning Network, the "channel". 
Any change to the state of the channel has to be signed by both parties.
So... let's say I open a channel with you for 0.1 BTC.  I contribute 0.1 BTC and you contribute 0.  Sometime later I send a payment of 0.01 to/through you.  We now both sign a transaction updating the ownership of the coins in our channel to 0.09 to me and 0.01 to you.  After 4 more of these signed transacions, I know own 0.05 and you own 0.05.  
You can't announce that you own all 0.1 BTC, because you have no transaction signed by me that verifies your claim.
If I really wanted to, I could produce the first update transaction, the one that said I own 0.09 and you own 0.01, and broadcast that transaction onto the block chain - hoping that I would cheat you out of .04 of your balance.
However, in that case, you could broadcast onto the network the latest transaction we both signed, giving us both 0.05 of the coins.  
The smart contract would then recognise my attempt to defraud you, and under the terms of the smart contract, not only would you get the 0.05 that are rightfully yours, you would get the whole 0.1 BTC and I would get nothing.  This is the built-in punishment for attempting to cheat the system.
Does this answer your question?

'I've done some research and I think that Cardano is the future. Here's why I think it leaves Bitcoin in the dust. What do you think?'
In this case you've brought something to the table. You bring a reasoned argument, and a debate can follow. Of course Cardano doesn't have to be the coin, it could be whichever of the 1300+ coins you want to compare with Bitcoin.
'Hey prove to me that Bitcoin isn't MySpace and one of these other 1300 coins isn't Facebook. I won't tell you what characteristics I'm interested in, and I won't tell you which coin I think is better because I can't be assed. Just compare and contrast Bitcoin with each of them and answer any questions I might have after that.'
That's a lot of work for someone else to do. You're doing none of the work and offering nothing in return.  In the real world you either commission someone to do this research for you, or hope you find a magazine or something that has a special on it.

Lightning will bring us instant payments.  Until then, where speed is of the essence, I recommend using fiat.  I don't see the advantage in using my fiat to buy Bitcoin, and then paying some service provider to convert the Bitcoin back to the fiat the restaurant banks.  When it's instant, it will be faster than using a card to pay,it will even be faster than counting out cash and waiting for change.  At that point, there are real advantages.  Until then, I see only a false sense of urgency.

Your prediction for the future is as good as anyone's I won't challenge that.
My point, such as it was, is that this chart gets posted so frequently, it's bound to land before a major correction sometime.  
Between March and July 2010, Bitcoin shot up by 2,600% to the heady price of 8 US cents.
A year later it had exploded to $31.  I make that a gain of 38,000%
Two years later, June 2013, it was at $100. 
December 2013 - January 2014 saw prices peak at about $1200, if I recall correctly.  It took a couple of years to regain that value.
Yes, 2017 has been another big year for growth.  But the thing is that the chart that keeps getting posted never has any scale.  The impression is always given that the value TODAY is right around the peak or the bull trap just after the peak.  
People can play with the axes to make that chart fit a 50% gain, a 500% gain, or a 50,000% gain.
Again, I make no predictions on the future price.  Your guess is every bit as good and informed as mine.

@_date: 2018-01-20 10:47:21
There is no payment provider.
 
No trust is required since the only transactions that transfer ownership of coins are signed by both parties.
On the other hand. In a big block world, where running your own node is actively discouraged, you trust some other party/parties to decide on the rules and to validate blocks against those rules for you. *That's* your Visa 2.0.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:48:30
I still think you miss the point about "power".
If your node is actively moving blocks around, and deciding which blocks to move and which to reject, then it has power in relation to determining consensus rules.  Maybe it doesn't have as much influence as a mining node or a node run by an exchange, but if its one of many smaller nodes which are acting in concert, then that combined power is not to be sneezed at.
Again, I refer to S2X, which many exchanges and miners were behind, but they had to abandon it in the face of the network consensus established by us smaller node operators.
I think that the point in terms of performance and redundancy is made.  That the more peers (nodes) you have hosting and sharing the blockchain, the faster the blocks move around.

Gosh!  Thanks for explaining what the mempool was.  I would never have guessed.  
As I was saying, the number of transactions in the mempool started suddenly to decrease from about Jan 19/20th. 
Your theory seems to be that that was the the 48 hours when suddenly, across the world, Bitcoin users finally lost their patience and decided in unison "I give up.  I am no longer going to do any Bitcoin transactions".  Coincidence?  Some mass user organisation?  You don't clarify.  
Me, I think that that was the day that some exchange or something like that started batching transactions.  So instead of sending 100 transactions to move the coins of 100 customers, they send one transaction, with lots of inputs and outputs.  Same number of people transacting, just one transaction.  This doesn't require the coincidence/conspiracy that your theory does.
Furthermore, it's evidenced by the number of transactions per block dropping and the size of transactions increasing.  It is further evidence by the fact that the *number* of transactions in the mempool is falling faster than the *size* of the mempool.
I dunno, Yogi.  I think my theory looks better than yours.
But the mere existence of my theory, and the spam theory, along with your theory, says that your "no arguing about that", is just delusional.
There are multiple reasons why the mempool could be decreasing.  I've just added two to your one.  No doubt there are other theories too.

If there are channels like this:

If you send funds to Jane, then yes both you and Jane are aware of the transaction.  Mary is not.
If you send funds to Mary through Jane, Jane does not know if those funds are for Mary, or for someone that Mary has a channel with.  Likewise, if the funds are not for Mary, she will not know if they came from Jane or from you.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:56:44


Hmm. From your terminology, it's apparent that your opinion isn't based on information coming directly from the Bitcoin or Lightning dev teams.  
An onchain transaction is required to open and close your channel.  Note that this channel is to the *network* and not just to a specific partner.
For the cost of these two onchain transactions, you can now have umpteen individual transactions with different partners. So if you fund your channel with $50 of Bitcoin, you could make thousands of 1c micro payments.
You could extend further by getting involved as a seller of something so that people send funds *to* your channel.

@_date: 2018-01-24 10:52:10


And...?  People are unlikely open a channel and agree to share custody of funds with a random strange node. You will probably want to have some sort of relationship with whoever owns the other node before agreeing to open the channel.  You still don't need to *trust* them, but it will be a good idea to *know* them.  Even still, I'm sure there will be repeated fraudsters preying on the unwary, just as they scam people for other currencies on other platforms, but as in those cases, they will be a minority.


You don't need to worry about the entire network.  You only need to watch your own channels.  Any volume outside of that is completely irrelevant to you.


This is where you stayed on your assumption train for far too long.  People who already run bitcoin nodes 24/7 are unlikely to have an issue with adding a ln to that and monitoring it 24/7.  Even with occasional timeouts for reboots and power outages, it's unlikely they will be offline for longer than the channel timeout.  If they want to be more sure, they could easily and cheaply run a second node just to monitor their own transactions.
Running your own node is good, mkay?
But even if you don't want to be a peer on the peer-to-peer network, and you are happy to use some service provider's node, then that service provider is even more likely to have redundant systems and less downtime, and so they can monitor your channels as part of the service.
And even then, if you still want to trust someone else to monitor for you, there's absolutely no need to assume that it it will be a big centralised service.


The *on-chain* network is public.  I have a copy :)  So this is a weird note for you to end on.  But, let's say you invite someone to monitor your channel for you - they know very little about the channel.  They don't know who your channel is with, and they don't know how much the channel is for.

Well tempting as it may be to imagine they do, BCash supporters don't necessarily all share the same opinions. From my time on it's pretty clear that there's at least a sizeable chunk of BCash supporters who express clearly that having any transactions off chain is a heresy.  It will be interesting to see them move on from that position to share your openness to the idea.
As regards Segwit, it will be interesting to see the BCash developers evolve to second layer solutions without Segwit's malleability fix. But I guess they can just copy paste what they need from the Bitcoin code.

The fee is relatively low as you happened to try your transaction in the middle of a spam attack.  However, it's working its way up to the top of the stack, but it's hard to predict when it will be processed as more transactions come in all the time, and there's no way to predict what fees they will pay.
If you are in a hurry and your wallet supports it, you could try to bump the fee up with a Replace By Fee transaction.

No idea how many Bitcoin users there are.


I'm not OP, that's , but I think you've misconstrued what they were saying.
If you want to use Lightning, you need to monitor your channel for contract breaches.  If you run your own node, you can do this for yourself.  If you don't you can outsource this responsibility to someone else. 
If, for example, you normally just leave your coins on an exchange, then the exchange probably uses its own node, and so it could monitor any of its user's channels, or maybe it would just set up its own channels and monitor those.
Either way, and all the usual warnings about leaving your coins on an exchange aside, this means that it should actually be *easier* for those exchange users to use Lightning.
OP says that these users complain that LN is not a solution, when in fact it could be the ideal solution for them, giving them the advantage of low fee, instant transactions, without having to run the infrastructure to monitor it.
OP can correct me if I've misinterpreted.

The parties in your channel are you and someone else. No coins in that channel can move without you both signing off on it.
If you don't sign the change, then it didn't happen.
The coins in your channel are thus represented by a current state signed by both of you. The current state becomes obsolete when a new state is signed.
If the other party tries to cheat you by settling on chain with an old state where he had more of the coins, you can show the current state (signed by both of you). In that case you don't just get however many coins you own in the current state, you get all coins in the channel.

When you run a full node in listening mode you become a peer on the peer to peer network.  You share block data with other peers, and validate anything you receive.
If your node rejects a block it received, then it doesn't share that rejected block with other nodes, and you (temporarily initially) block the node that sent it to you.  When a majority of nodes agree on the validation rules, then any block built to different rules will not propagate, and the node that sent it, will have trouble broadcasting any more blocks to the network.  
In this way, your node serves two purposes.  You are part of the communication network, and you get to participate in the decision around which blocks are valid on the chain.  If you are an outlier, running different validation rules to everyone else, then you will be excluded from the chain.  On the other hand, if you run the consensus validation rules that have majority representation on the network, then you help defend the network from blocks that don't meet those consensus rules.

The channel opened in step 1 could not initially be used by the TShirt shop to receive payment.  The other party to the channel, has 0 BTC on the channel, and so has nothing to send to the TShirt shop.
That channel could only be used by the TShirt shop to send coins to someone else.  Only after that could the other party send whatever they have back to the TShirt shop.

Bitcoin is an open source project. Anyone with the skills can contribute to the code. Somewhere over 300 individuals have contributed.
The developers can't force anyone to adopt new releases or take advantage of the code. See for example Coinbase not implementing Segwit.
Last year a separate group forked the code to increase blocksize - so called Segwit2X or S2X. Miners generally approved of the change which was implemented with no protection for user funds. The change was called off when it was clear that the Bitcoin network, in the form of nodes which anyone can run, organised overwhelmingly to reject the proposed changes.
That's the decentralised decision making of Bitcoin in a tion. The dev team declined to make a particular change. A self selected Bitcoin elite - mainly miners, exchanges and an online wallet provider forced the issue by copying and changing the code so that both options could be made available. The community made its choice.

So you did pull your "vast majority" out of your ass.  Thanks for confirming.
Many users find that their favourite wallet doesn't support segwit yet.  Many transactions from exchanges (over the choice of technology for which users have zero control) haven't upgraded to segwit yet.
You don't understand the relevance of BCash to this conversation?  Let me try to break it down a little for you.
You claim that the "vast majority" of users didn't want segwit and wanted large blocks.  That's *precisely* what BCash offers.  But the vast majority of Bitcoin users have not started USING Bitcoin Cash instead.  Perhaps, because they don't want those things.  If you do, it's there waiting for you.
That might not solve all your problems, though.  The relevance of my second point is that even with its Bigger Blocks, BCash failed to sustain more transactions per block than Bitcoin did, running up a congested mempool when we were told this wouldn't happen with Bigger Blocks.

You could premine your coin.  Some do.
Whether you premine or not, when you launch your coin, you have to convince people that it's actually worth something.  Otherwise it has no value, and it doesn't matter whether you personally have 1 GhostTeaCalmCoin or 1,000,000 of them - zilch multiplied by anything is zilch.
Premining it tends to reduce the value your coin is likely to get, as it creates suspicion that it's a get rich quick scam, like you described.  It's not necessarily a scam (maybe the premined coins are all publicly accounted for and spent on things that increase the value of the coin for everyone) but it might well be.
The most important thing for a new, reputable, coin is that it's somehow *better* than what's already available on the market.  Even if it's only better in a specific niche, if that's an important niche, your coin may have value.  You'll also need an excellent technical team.  Nothing kills a coin like a failure to actually launch, or a big security hole, or lots of other things that a good tech team can help you avoid.

Depending on the features supported by your wallet, you might be able to Replace By Fee (RBF) to resend the transaction with a higher fee.
It's not something I've ever done, though, so I can't offer specific advice.
The fee on the original transaction is 2.632 sat/B.  Right now, there are about 5,800 transactions in the queue with a fee of 2 sat/B or greater, including 2,258 with fee of 3 sat/B or more.  If there were no more transactions coming in with a higher fee, you could expect this transaction to be processed within an hour from now.  As it is, think it should go through today sometime.

It's normal.  The difference can come from a lot of things like the size of the market (number of buyers and selllers) on each exchange, the ease/difficulty in getting fiat into or out of the exchange etc
Take three fictional exchanges, Slowdex, Speedydex and Nimbledex.  Slowdex only deals in Bitcoin, and it takes 3 weeks to withdraw cash.  Nimbledex and Speedydex have a much faster cash withdrawal and also deal in other cryptos.  
In that setup, Slowdex will probably have a much higher dollar price for your Bitcoin.
Say you fancy trading.  You send your Bitcoin to Slowdex and sell it at a high price.  Now what?  You could re-buy on Slowdex, but even if the price goes down, it's still higher than the other exchanges.  Or you could withdraw your fiat and watch the market move without you as you wait three weeks for your cash to arrive.  That's why the price is higher, to compensate you the seller for this dead time.
On the other hand, you can transfer your funds much faster between Nimbledex and Speedydex, so they will both be relatively cheap and the difference between them will quickly flattened out by arbitrage traders moving coins between them.

Exactly how easy it will be depends on the evolution of the particular wallet you choose.
But ultimately, you're comparing (a) reaching into your pocket, getting your card and tapping it with (b) reaching into your pocket , getting your phone and scanning a QR code.
In the case of (a) your card provider has probably set limits on how many times you can tap before you have to insert the card and enter a pin, and a max transaction value that you can use contactless for.
In the case of (b) this is not the case.

Blocksize may well increase in addition to the block optimisation measures. Some of which are already live.

I didn't recommend an escrow service, because I have never used one.  I buy from people I trust to deliver.  No disrespect to OP but, a quick google would have revealed the site he purchased from on this occasion to be a scammer.
Other payment systems tend to favour heavily the word of the buyer over the seller.  You're right in that Paypal would have refunded OP.  They would likely have refunded OP whether or not he got the miner.  Get your new gadget in the mail.  Complain to the seller that you never got it.  And if the seller doesn't give you your money back, complain to paypal or Visa, and they will refund you.
So while you might see it as safe as a buyer, it's expensive and risky for sellers.
That's why you never sell bitcoin on paypal.  After receiving the bitcoin, the scammer can request a refund on Paypal, and it seems extremely likely they will get it.
Getting ripped off through chargebacks is just as big an issue as getting ripped off through non-delivery.
But while the buyer can do some research on the seller before deciding to buy, it is much, much harder for the seller to do research on the buyer.
It's all a matter of choice, and timing.  Bitcoin is just 9 years old and has a lot more growing up to do.  Remember Visa started out with people catching a physical impression of your card on carbon paper, which they stuck in a drawer until some time later when they mailed it off to a Visa office.  If someone had your card and could do a reasonable copy of your signature, they had loads of time to rip people off.
With Lighting, Bitcoin is poised to become faster, cheaper and more scalable than Credit Cards.
The extent to which Visa covers any fraud varies by jurisdiction and by how you use your card, and how the merchant accepts it.  But ultimately it's insurance.  There's a market there to offer an insurance service on trades using crypto currencies as well.  It may come.
What is definitely coming is those areas where Visa and paypal have never successfully reached, streaming micropayments, smart contracts, and so much more. 
And right now, what Bitcoin gives us, is freedom from censorship.  Visa unilaterally decided that its customers could no longer send donations to Wikileaks.  A charity I used to support had its accounts closed by its bank.  Frequently, there are national rules embargoing trade with entities in other countries.  I can bypass any of that with Bitcoin and send my money to anyone I like.
Not only that, but the mainstream financial system itself has been riddled with fraud and dodgy dealings.  Lehman, Libor, rotten derivatives packages, misselling of mortgages, insurance, etc etc etc.... and the cost is being borne by people. Banking losses were socialised.  Made into government debt overnight.  Too big to fail.
I don't argue that Bitcoin is perfect.  I don't even argue that it's always the best payment method in every scenario.  It is, however, early days in the development of something extraordinary.

S2X was called off because the proponents finally admitted that they had not achieved consensus for their change.  The email announcing this didn't say how they determined this lack of consensus.  It wasn't an issue with miner consensus - most (though by no means all) mining pools were signalling support at the time of the announcement.  It wasn't an issue with social media commentary - any negative sentiment on social media was written off by proponents as echo chamberism, and in any case the negative sentiment had been there for months, it wasn't a sudden event that derailed plans at the end.  It was that the overwhelming majority of nodes on the network were set to reject any S2X blocks.  That's why it was called off.
It did go live eventually, when some rebel proponents decide to launch it anyway.  Due to code quality issues, it failed to work and the S2X blockchain was still-born.


That's not true.  And while your analysis might be valuable to you, forgive me if I refer to more canonical sources:




Or for a more experiential verification, simply run a node in listening mode with the required port open and monitor the network traffic.


Your interpretation of the history of S2X is somewhat farcical.  Your reference to "developers" signing up to the NYA overlooks the fact that the development team of the Bitcoin Core reference client didn't sign up to it.  A self-selected Bitcoin "elite" met in a closed room to decide what was best for our coin.
Segwit had, of course, already been made available in the code used by noderunners and was to be activated by UASF on August 1st.  At that point non-compliant miners would find their transactions rejected by these nodes.  Miners didn't generously move first as a sign of good faith, miners upgraded to Segwit to stay on the Bitcoin network.
Noderunners and the Bitcoin core development team did not pull any rugs and did not renege on any agreement.  Neither group was party to the agreement.
There are lessons from S2X for those who care to learn them.
1.  Miners do not have absolute control over the network, if their blocks do not comply with the rules verified by the nodes, blocks will be rejected.
2.  There are industry players who seek to disenfranchise Bitcoin users by centralising control of Bitcoin development into their cartel.
3.  When you want to "upgrade" the software that runs a financial network of hundreds of millions of dollars, some caution is required.  At the very least, you might want to ensure that your software is stable and tested before you launch it.
I've never said that miners are evil, so I'll ignore that little strawman,  My concern is with control of a coin being centralised as was attempted by S2X, and as was delivered by BCash. 
The relationship between miners and nodes has a number of facets, but one of them is like the relationship between a food producer and a national food standards authority.  The producer is free to adopt any standards they like in the production of their products, but if those standards don't meet the standards required by the agency, then that market will be closed to the producer.  If the producer fails to meet a standard required by every agency then there is no market for their product.
Arguing for the removal of nodes is denying the need for the standards agencies, and assuming that food producers will always act in the consumer's best interest.  As various scandals have shown in that industry, that's not exactly  a safe assumption.  Just as it hasn't been in the world of big banking.  
It gets even more critical when you acknowledge the deeply centralised nature of Bitcoin mining.  One hardware company has a near monopoly on mining equipment.  The same company owns one of the biggest mining pools and has a significant stake in a number of the other big ones.
Even if the man behind that company is entirely benevolent, it would be crazy to gift him such an enormous influence over Bitcoin.
Your assessment of the future of mining income is also at odds with the facts.  Bitcoin block rewards halve every four years and so a greater percentage of miner income will come from transaction fees.  You only get mining transaction fees from mining onchain transactions.  A shift to off chain transactions is a shift away from mining income.
If Bitcoin isn't a trustless, peer-to-peer system and instead is to  become a centralised trust-based system where miners have full control over the protocol and everyone else is merely a passive service user, then not only have we lost the soul of Bitcoin, but we're also using the wrong technology.  In a centralised, trust-based system, the data can be far more efficiently maintained and quickly accessed in a database.

Most governments already require KYC/AML registration when you open an account on an exchange.  If you do a large transfer of fiat from your exchange, banks in many countries will be required to flag that with some government authority.  Capital gains on Bitcoin are taxable in many countries.

@_date: 2018-01-28 13:36:24
Your original comment, which started our little exchange, was entirely different to that which you have now come to.
The figure/range you quoted was not, as you originally claimed, 'the lowest fee' to get into that block.
It was, however, your best guess. Your guess led you to pay more than lots of others who got in the same block. You're fine with that, because you were in a hurry. That's your call.
But the facts remain that what you paid was not 'the lowest fee', as you originally claimed, and therefore you overpaid, as I claimed.
I think we're in agreement at this point.
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:27:06
This chart doesn' show the entire set of unprocessed transactions. The node its using has been throttled to limit the size of its copy of the mempool. It does this by removing the lowest fee transactions.
As more of the higher fee transactions get cleared, more low fee transactions make it into his mempool and thus his charts.

1.  Reputational damage.  Your attempted fraud will be public knowledge.  Why would anyone want to open a channel with you knowing that you have a history of attempted fraud?
2.  I completely fail to recognise what you are referring to here.  When Alice has a channel with Bob, the coins represented in that channel will only ever be owned by Alice and/or Bob.  Alice is unlikely to be involved in a million transactions per second, and in the event Bob attempts to defraud her, she doesn't have to catch him immediately. As per the terms of their contract, she has an agreed number of blocks in which to broadcast the breach remedy transaction.  This is explained in section 3.3.4 of the White Paper.
3.  Here, you are just discussing the weaknesses in you own proposed solution to a problem that you wrongly thought existed, so I think I can skip past this one.
4.  Is simply speculation based on some assumptions you've made.
5.  Is incorrect.  Every LN transaction is not public.  You seem to have an incorrect grasp of how remedy transactions work.
6.  I don't see in the White Paper any reference to agreeing network fees beforehand.  And googling for "lightning network" and "fixed fee problem" only returned 4 hits, only one of which related to the Lightning Network, and *that* was this page.  What evidence do you have that this problem actually exists?
7.  Yet again, your misunderstanding of the mechanics of Breach Remedy Transactions seems to be informing this claim.
8.  Once again, is informed by your misunderstanding of Breach Remedy Transactions.
Honestly, man (woman, child, whatever), read up on it.  You don't have to instantly catch any fraud attempt.  Your channel can allow lots of time to resolve channel disputes where the channel is unilaterally closed.  The example in the White Paper uses 1,000 blocks as the period.  At a rate of 6 blocks per hour, effectively a week.  How much control you have over this value will likely depend on the wallet you choose.

I quoted you saying that BCash "preserves and continues" the nature and ambition of the project, and then demonstrated how BCash has no continuity with original Bitcoin, given that it actively made itself incompatible with it.
It's hard to discuss the"ideological" nature, when you try simultaneously to argue that any ideological interpretation is at once subjective and on the other that it's somehow absolute.  Note how your discussion of the ideology makes shows no subjectivity... no "I think", no "in my opinion",... just bald assertions as if they were fact.
This somewhat suggests that it will be pointless trying to discuss this you, but I'm game for one more response.
The problem with making pronouncements on the ideology of Bitcoin is that Satoshi is not here to expound further on what that ideology was.  This, to me, is a good thing.  Bitcoin should take its leadership from the community and not from a leader.
BCash does not encourage users to run full nodes, and some of the more influential proponents of the coin (Fake Satoshi) suggests that full nodes are only of interest to tin foil hat wearers.  Instead, the BCash vision is that you use the services of some third party to propagate your transactions and to validate blocks on your behalf.
What does the White Paper say about using such trusted intermediaries?  


Oh dear.  Right there in the Abstract, and we're already running into trouble reconciling the BCash and Satoshi vision.
Throughout, the WP. he refers to the importance of the distributed and decentralised nature of Bitcoin, yet BCash is actively seeking to centralise it, by concentrating more and more power in the hands of miners who mostly use equipment from one manufacturer, with a patent advantage in mining technology on BCash. 
And at the end of the white paper, Satoshi allows for consensus decision making to decide on the rule changes.  That's how Bitcoin got to where it is today.
And later, in a mail trail, Satoshi is quoted as supporting the idea of second level solutions.  Something abhorrent to many BCash proponents.
The above observations, in my opinion, rubbish the claims of BCash to being the One True Bitcoin.
The White Paper makes no reference to Mining Pools, yet there seems to be no problems in BCash embracing this innovation without complaining that it's not part of the original vision.
BCash is just another alt, and it should succeed or fail on its own merits.  But by being the only alt that bleats on that it's not an alt and is really the real Bitcoin, that just makes it look pathetic.  In my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:24:58


They saved it from S2X.
Nodes are the means by which the blockchain propagates.  If you mine a block, and it is rejected by the nodes, then that block doesn't get added to the consensus chain.  In the unlikely event that 100% of miners fall into that circumstance, then more miners would take the opportunity to mine by consensus rules.
It's no red herring, it's a balance of power.  


Which was the frightening force behind S2X.  A self-selected elite in a boardroom decided that they owned the decision-making on the future of Bitcoin.  They learned that this was not the case, and that the decentralised nature of Bitcoin meant that any user who wants it has a say.
BCash hasn't really been around long enough and been through enough decisions to confirm who sets the direction, but it seems to be actively opposed to the idea of anyone but miners having a say.  That's not healthy.  Especially when a single company has such a stranglehold over mining.

So the answer to your question is that if all regular onchain transactions drop to zero, as they move to Lightning, the channel opening transactions will have low fees onchain.
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:10:25
Not exactly true.
During the peak days of 13-15 January, the engine wasn't exactly running at full tilt generating 8MB blocks time after time.  It never kicked into full capacity even while the mempool was filling.  Block size varied all over the place.
[This one]( for example, wasn't even 1MB.
BCash just didn't scale up.  I don't know why.  Miner preference?  Software bug? Whatever it was, BCash didn't deliver consistently on its 8MB blocks, the first time it was asked to.  Under a relatively small volume of large transactions for a small duration, it failed to keep up.

No.  That's completely untrue.  Segwit didn't cause any hard fork.  Those who didn't agree with it might have responded by creating a hard fork and a new coin, but Segwit didn't *cause* it.  The hard fork that created BCash was *caused* by those who wanted BCash.


That's precisely what the original wording *did* deny.  They even included the word "technically".


This is nonsense too.  Bitcoin blocks are compatible with previous versions of the Bitcoin protocol.  BCash's are not.  The only line of continuity runs through Bitcoin.

Segwit is just a change to the data structure.  If you want a really basic description, instead of the more complete one I linked to, I'll try.  But this is just a hamfisted attempt to condense technical data into simple words.
Signatures can make take up a lot of data in a transaction.  The more inputs you have in one transaction, the more signatures you need, and the bigger that transaction gets.  And the fewer transactions you can include in the data space reserved for transactions.  Segwit simply takes that data and moves it to a different part of the data structure.  So now you can fit more transactions in to each block.
That's it. No bogey men.
The alternative approach, to just keep increasing block size, *that*  absolutely centralises things.  Imagine you want 100 times as many people using Bitcoin.  Imagine you want each of them doing 100 times as many transactions (all those things you buy every day, vending machines, paying for parking, topping up a phone, paying for access to a web page...).  Imagine you want each of those transactions happening 100 times as fast as they did with a non-segwit 1 MB block.  Now you want a 100 * 100 * 100 * 1MB block.  That's a 1 terabyte block.  And you've barely scratched the surface of the transaction volume we all want to get to.  You think every Joe Layman is going to be able to run a node that can download and process a 1 terabyte block every 10 minutes?  Nope.   That's going to become another centralised function.

The wording is a little vague.
To convince someone to buy bitcoin, you will add 20% to whatever they put in.  You, in effect, put in 16.67% of the investment.
In return for this, you want 10% of the value of the investment.  So, if the combined stake buys 1 Bitcoin, you own 10% of that Bitcoin.
So far it looks like you're giving money away.  You paid for 16.67% of a coin, and you only claim 10% of it.
I don't know what this bit means:


It could mean that you only become entitled to anything if/when Bitcoin hits that price.  It could mean that you take 10% of any value up to that price, but any value over that is all assigned to your client.  Or it could mean something else.  I have no idea, so I have to skip this bit.


This is the bit that would have me running a mile.  How the hell do I know where you will be in 3 years time.  You could be bust, dead,  in Burkina Faso... maybe all three.

1.  If you leave your coins on an exchange like Coinbase, then you don't really have them.  They have them for you.  If Coinbase gets hacked, or goes out of business, or even just goes down for a couple of days, you could find yourself in some trouble.
2.  It's your coin.  You can spend or save as you see fit.
3.  In reality not a lot of places accept Bitcoin yet.  There are some big exceptions like overstock, but we've got a long way to go yet.  Some places accept coin in physical shops.  If you want to buy "euro/dollars", then that's selling your coins.  You can do that in person, on an exchange or via localbitcoins.
4.  There's a lot of things happening in Bitcoin at the moment... new people coming in, new technologies coming, greater interest from the financial sector.  The price can go down as well as up.

That's a silly claim. It has increased blocksize, which is what some would see as the 'improvement'.  The viability of this approach to scaling has beeb discussed ad nauseum. I doubt there's any benefit in rehashing here.
Another difference is that BCH has not implemented Segwit. It's hard to understand any reason for this. Not only does it optimise tranaction size, it also fixes a malleability issue, improves the linearity of sighash calculations, hashes the input value of a transaction, improves multisig security, script versioning, etc... 
These are real improvements, and they are in Bitcoin, not in BCH.

No.  But shapeshift and changelly exist.  And they take my coins and send coins to whatever address I tell them to.  All without KYC/AML.
By your reading of the Fincen regulations, that shouldn't be happening.  But it is.  All the time.
Similarly, when you pay a retailer in Bitcoin, using some point of sale conversion service to turn your coins into dollars,  do you have to provide proof of ID?  Or are those conversion utilities free to take your coins anonymously?  Again, these services already exist.  No hypothesising needed.

A Lightning node is a multisig wallet. Do you have any examples of the feds shutting down multisig wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:46:06
Segwit is the missed opportunity.  It's there.  It's live.  Yet it's not supported on all exchanges and wallets.  If it were, we would see a huge increase in transaction throughput.  If your wallet isn't taking advantage of it, there are others that can.  Ditto exchange.
What some people forget is that a blocksize increase is not an overnight deal.  It needs to announced in plenty of time to give exchanges a chance to prepare for it, it needs to be developed, it needs to be tested, and it needs to be adopted by the network via a hard fork.` That's a few months at least.  And whether or not it has any impact *at all* depends on how many nodes decide to support it.  That kind of confusion is not in Bitcoin's interest at the moment.
What is in Bitcoin's interest is getting segwit support into Core's GUI, educating people about segwit, pressurising non-supporting wallets and exchanges to get onto it or lose customers, and to support the introduction of Lightning.  Nothing will screw things up more right now than another contentious hard fork which leaves Lightning network unsure of what Bitcoin network they need to be developing and testing on.
There couldn't *be* a worse time to fuck about with blocksize than right now.
And still, it needs to be reiterated, that for those who disagree, they have other choices.  If you think that Big Blocks make Big Sense, and you are frustrated that Bitcoin isn't implementing them now, then you have other coins you can use.
BCH has a value of a sizeable percentage of BTC, but drawing any conclusions from that is a bit risky.  It could be a subsection of coin users completely organically looking for a Big Block coin, or it could  be market manipulation by Ver, Coinbase and others.  Most likely, it's something from column A and something from column B.  And whether the natural demand component will continue to exist at whatever level it currently is when Lightning offers cheap, fast confirmed transactions at a speed outside of anything BCH can offer... well, that remains to be seen.

Core has segwit support, just not built into the GUI yet.  The core team had to do some rapid reprioritisation to protect user funds when S2X refused to implement replay protection.
There are a few wallets supporting segwit.  Others say that they are waiting for the "reference implementation" in the core Client.
In January (2017), Blockchain.info claimed that [they were "ready for" Segwit]( and actively promoting it.  Somehow, they haven't got around to implementing it yet.

Sorry. For some reason, I thought your question was about the super miner stopping.
If a single company was doing all the mining, then that would be huge security issue for Bitcoin. A POW change would then be absolutely required.
New miners would appear to mine the new POW. Bitcoin nodes would reject blocks from the superminer and Bitcoin would carry on.
A far more successful move for the super miner would be to give some illusion of choice by selling mining kit to subsidiaries, while simultaneously adopting a new fork that actively disincenitivises users from running nodes.

You can press your wallet provider to support segwit transactions.  Soon, you can also take advantage of offchain transactions to bypass the mempool when you buy your coffee.

Different pools of buyers and sellers on each exchange.
Sometimes, there can be a premium.  For example, if it takes me a day to withdraw my fiat from exchange A, and a week from exchange B.  A seller is likely to want a higher price to compensate them for having their funds tied up for longer.

Unless you're an active daytrader, there is no good reason for leaving coins on an exchange. Get them to a wallet where only you know the keys.
There's a wide choice with different features. You need to decide which is right for you.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:03:01
1.  You argue for central mining cartel to have a monopoly on deciding which transactions get included in a block.
2.  Extra decimals can be added as and when needed.  With 1 satoshi currently working out at about 0.01658 US cents, I think we can hold off on this "problem" for now.
3.  You argue for a centralised control by an agency of some country or multinational.  
Speaking personally, I place my trust in the maths, and in the quality of the code, and the activity of the ecosystem.
There probably will be coins like you describe.  The crypto ruble is already being spoken about.  This will probably not even need to be mined as a centralised authority will decide who has sent what to whom.  What you gain in efficiency, you lose in censorship resistance.
If you just want Amazon Bux, how is that different to an Amazon gift card?

Miners are still required to process on chain transactions.  For now, a miner is rewarded with 12.5 new bitcoins per block plus any transaction fees in the block.  When all coins are mined, they will get only the transaction fees.
Anyone could hard fork the code to change the rules around block rewards, but if no-one adopts the new fork, then it's worthless.  Bitcoin Diamond, for example, has forked and set the limit to 210 million of their coins.

There are tons of alternatives in place already.  I can't think of one that has as much active development (both in the coin team and in the surrounding ecosystem) as does Bitcoin.
However, if your assessment is different, then you're free to act on it.  I'm just not sure why you would waste your time here in that case.  I mean, I'm not spending my time telling the fans of dogecoin, maidsafe or zcash what I think about their coin.  Still, how you spend your time is up to you too.

@_date: 2017-12-25 18:03:37
It diverts development effort from across the ecosystem. Not only would the core team need to drop everything to do it, so would wallet and exchange dev teams - thereby delaying the strategic solutions. Then comes the hard fork itself, which could be pretty divisive and the change could be rejected by the network.
Better all round to play the long game and deliver the strategic solution first.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:34:02


Not sure why you expect me to answer that.  You could try following the project teams to find out.


The notion that Blockstream controls Core development has been debunked umpteen times.  Only a tiny few of the few hundred developers on the Core team are Blockstream employees, and the commits are not controlled by any of them.  You really need to broaden your sources of information.

The most common way to buy Bitcoin is via an exchange. These are a bit like stock exchanges. It can take a while
 to initially register at one of these.  Because they can hold fiat in your name, they have to satisfy themselves as to your real identity. Once you have uour account set up, you can send money to it and buy Bitcoin.
I use Bitstamp, but the right exchange for you will depend on where you are and what your local currency is.

Steam wasn't an early cheerleader.  They only started "accepting" Bitcoin last year, but leaving that aside...
You've done your appraisal and you think it's worth nothing.  I would say in that case, you should just ignore it and move on.  No hard feelings.  We're all only relying on our own assessment after all.  But I see that might be difficult for you as you appear to have shorted Bitcoin at 11k just a week ago, so maybe it's not entirely easy for you to just walk away.
I don't use Bitcoin for a lot of purchases.  I use it to pay for my VPN, and that's really about it.  For most other purchases, other methods are more convenient right now.  I can see that changing with improved technologies built on the Bitcoin foundation.  As far as I'm concerned, Bitcoin is in its infancy.  The best is yet to come.
The 220k transaction backlog isn't there at "any given time", it is a sporadic peak that happens once in a while.  Just like rush hour traffic, concert tickets selling out in 2 minutes, and so on.  And, we can fix that.  Segwit is already available, we just need more wallets to implement it, Lightning is coming soon, and there are many more improvements in the pipeline.
Your reference to alts is completely misguided.  There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin.  Someone forking off a new alt coin is not creating more Bitcoin, they are creating something different, and they have to go convince people of the value of their new token.  I can grab a canvas and some paint, but I can't create a hundred new Mona Lisas. 
There is utility in Bitcoin right now.  You can sell your goods or services right now for Bitcoin, and you can buy someone else's.  The speed at which you get payment is somewhat variable, but you can do it. 
And the future holds the promise of so much more.  Not just faster transactions to buy your coffee, but ways for people to pay for much much smaller things, stuff you can't put on a credit card at the moment.  And not just people.  You can have autonomous things doing transactions.  We haven't even begun to imagine yet what that opens up.

The transaction which funded the [sending address]( is unconfirmed.  So you were trying to send coins which you have not actually received yet.
The [transaction]( which funded the sending address for *that* transaction is also coming from an address that has not been funded.
How/why were you trying to send funds which you had not yet received and which the "person" sending them to you had not even received yet - in a chain of odd transactions that all seem to have happened within 30 minutes of each other?

Maybe not opaque, but a cartel, nonetheless.  A group with exclusive rights to process transactions.  And presumably some other group to oversee them, and to replace them as some miners leave and others seek to take their place.  That's placing a lot of centralised control in the hands of whoever these people are.  And these people would get to decide which transactions are to be allowed.


It's not the name of Amazon Bux that I was asking about.  It was what the difference would be between it and an Amazon gift card.  I can convert cash to Amazon credit.  I can send Amazon credit to someone else.  I guess that all Amazon would need to add would be an ability to convert my gift card back to cash, and it would now be Amazon bux or whaetever.  I don't see the attraction.  It's still a centralised piece of crap and my ability to spend it at any retailer other than Amazon is not just based on which retailers are willing to accept it, but also who Amazon is willing to do business with.

You open a multisig wallet with a third party. Should they try to somehow rip you off, you can close it. Your funds are protected by smart contracts.  You can run your own node to validate all onchain transactions.
Compare that to an onchain scaling where you are told not to run your own node. Not only do you trust miners to process every single transaction, you also trust them to validate each transaction and decide on the validation rules.  Much, much more trust involved there.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin is a bit congested at the moment, so $5 isn't really going to give you much of a chance to experiment with it - exchange fees and miner fees will quickly eat into that.

At the moment, transactions of 70 sat/Byte and under are being cleared.  At current prices, that's $2.33.
It would take a hard fork to  change block size.  That would be a contentious hard fork.  It would delay actual strategic solutions like Lightning and Segwit UI in core.  It would take months to ensure that miners, wallets and nodes were able to implement it.  And at the end of all that, there is absolutely no guarantee that the network would accept the change, and those months of effort would have been completely wasted.  It's absolutely the wrong thing to do right now.
On the other hand.  There already *was* a hard fork to increase block size.  It exists.  It's a thing.  If you want to use that for now, go for it.
Alternatively, if you want to continue to use Bitcoin, walk away from crap like coinbase and wallets that don't support segwit.

I interpret this as saying that you can't justify paying for a $100 purchase in Bitcoin because that much Bitcoin will be worth $110 tomorrow, $120 the day after etc...  You're better off paying for it in fiat, actual greenbacks.
I got a few things on that.  
First off, there's no guarantee that Bitcoin is going to keep appreciating in price.  Bits worth $100 today might be worth $90 tomorrow, or $50.  Who knows?
Secondly, if you go with the assumption that it's going to keep appreciating, why do you have greenbacks in your wallet at all?  If you have $100 in cash in your wallet, you've probably got it since you last got paid, right?  Let's say you got paid a week ago.  If you bought Bitcoin with that $100 on pay day, and it's appreciating every day, then the Bits that were worth $100 a week ago, might be worth $120 today.  Pay for the thing with Bits worth $100 today, and you've got $20 worth of Bits left.  If you just left the $100 in cash and spent $100, you would have nothing left.
Bitcoin adoption and technology is still in its infancy.  That accounts for the steadily increasing price.  At some point in the future, it will be more mature, and anyone who wants Satoshi will have what they can afford.  At that point, there will be less of a rush of new fiat into Bitcoin.
I believe, absolutely, in Bitcoin's future as a currency.

You're already flirting with one alternative.
If you centralise everything, then you don't need a blockchain.  Who holds what is decided by whatever globocorp you put at the centre of things.  You know, the entity that everyone trusts...
In the world of Blockchain (and Litecoin) another alternative is Lightning.  In that case, we could set up a channel between us (basically a multisig wallet) worth 0.1 of a Bitcoin or whatever.  That's one on-chain transaction.  After that we can transfer chunks of that coin to and from each other as we see fit.  I might buy a coffee from you, you might buy a hat from me, I might ask you to pass some coin on to Mary, you might ask me to pass some on the Guru.  This could be 5, 10, a hundred, whatever individual transactions between us, which we keep track of.  Then when the wallet contract expires, we settle back up on the blockchain.  So, out of the 0.1 Bitcoin, maybe you ended up with 0.06 and I got 0.04.  We take just a second transaction on the Blockchain to update this final score.
Lightning can take a whole load of transactions off the chain.  Freeing up space on the block chain itself, allowing for near-instant transactions.

What you say is fair, and you are not the first person to raise it. It has led to a few initiatives.
Segwit dents the usefulness of ASICBOOST which is a patented technology giving Bitmain miners an edge in mining.
Lightning takes transactions off chain where they don't have to be individually mined.
Another rival mining manufacturer company is expected to start shipping next year.
Cheap ASIC miners (&lt; $100) are available. These are unlikely to be profitable, but can be used to impede the ongoing centralisation.
There have been forks to switch to a different Proof of Work algorithm, which doesn't use ASICs... eg Litecoin, Vertcoin and Bitcoin Gold.

Oh dear.  Triggered?


I'm simply pointing out the obvious.  If you think that transaction fees are currently too high, there are alternatives with lower fees.  Pretending that there aren't would be dishonest.  Still, if you personally would rather ignore the alternatives and contribute to the fees race on Bitcoin, that's your choice - just don't pretend anyone is forcing you to do it.


Indeed.  Technical changes are underway.  That's possibly one of greatest advantages that Bitcoin has is the size, quality and dedication of its development team.  It's why I think it has a really bright future, while some alts may carve out very successful niches.  Some forks from Bitcoin have stagnated technically, I would be wary of them.

That transaction was only received at Bitcoin on December 19th. Wherever it was for the previous 9 days might be a matter between you and Blockchain.info.

Lots of wallets are choosing to wait for Core to complete its support (or using that as an excuse not to implement now), but it's certainly not a dependency.  There are a few wallets already offering Segwit support, and 10% or thereabouts of all transactions are segwit.

Dude. The new thing is not Bitcoin. Whatever it is, it's not Bitcoin. No new Bitcoins are created by an alt forking.
If I fork and create Spitcoin, what happens? If I change nothing else in the code, then chances are miners won't mine it, Bitcoin nodes won't accept it, and the coin will be DOA.
If I make some changes, then all of the above will still apply, until I can convince the market of the value of my new coin. If I succeed, value will be transferred from existing coins to my new one. If I fail, the value of my new coin will tumble to the floor.

If nobody is buying then, by definition, nobody is selling.  You can't sell if you can't find a buyer.
If there are more people *trying* to sell than are *trying* to buy, the market is stacked in the buyers favour. This means that those trying to sell may take whatever they can get, pushing the price down until they find a buyer.

You're still not clarifying what exactly you perceive those benefits to be.  You mention "security, primarily", but what is insecure about paypal with 2FA?
Once you centralise ledger updates, then you remove any need for a blockchain.  Just have the central authority (that everyone trusts) update its own ledger.


Paypal already charge fees.  And as shown above, their centralised database can be secured.  So what does it benefit paypal, it's merchants or its vendors to denominate funds in some intermediate paybux denomination?

Logging into my regular Amazon account using 2FA and using their software to update their ledger would be secure and wouldn't require the overhead of a blockchain.

You posted an article about the futures market servers crashing under load, but you make the decision not to link it using the article's own headline, you chose instead to lead with a claim which the article cites from a different article.
If what you found interesting was the effect of the futures market on Bitcoin or on the futures market servers, your choice of headline was a little odd.
On the other hand, if what you found interesting was the claim that 1,000 people own 40% of Bitcoin, then you could have linked to the article making that claim.  Or you could have engaged in the discussions from the other times it's been posted.
Either way, not a real biggie - it's just blowing more air into an unsubstantiated claim.

But even if they dropped everything and upped the blocksize, it would take months, be a contentious hard fork, and might be rejected by the network.

Why do the onchain purists promote those things?  That's a question for them.  I don't really understand it. 


Lighting network is a multitude of different interoperable implementations and anyone can create nodes on any of them.  I'm sure that there will be lots of organisations trying to create their own USP on the network, some specialising in low cost, some in high speed, some in greater resiliency, maybe better privacy, etc etc etc.  It's a whole new frontier.

@_date: 2017-12-06 16:27:06
Nodes are used to validate blocks.  If you validate blocks with your own node, you control the validation.  This is important for decentralisation.  It's even more important at the time of a contentious hard fork.  If you run your own node, you can decide which set of rules you accept.
The alternative is to trust some third party to do that for you.  Like maybe those folks who tried to impose S2X.
There are those whose vision of a peer-to-peer decentralised system relies exclusively on people using a third party exchange to sell them coins, a third party wallet service to store them, a third party node operator to validate blocks, and a third party to convert their coins back into fiat when they want to buy something, so that the person they want to pay gets the dollars they accept.  I don't see the peer-to-peer or decentralisation in any of that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:53:30

SegWit just changes the data schema so that the signature no longer contributes to block size.  You can read more [here]( 


There are no IOU's.  There are multisig wallets which make up channels.  And any two parties can open up such a channel.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:50:08
Well, that's some dumb shit right there.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:59:30


The discussion has already started.


Perhaps you missed the point that there are already things in development.  We already lost time because the dev team had to drop what they were doing to save our Bitcoins from the S2X attack.  It makes no sense whatsoever to interrupt development plans once again to drop everything for a hard fork just to increase block size.
Let's get segwit implemented on wallets.  Let's get Lightning live.  Let's get schnorr and mimblewimble out there.  Let's get a scalable architecture in place.
Then, if an increase in blocksize is still needed, sure... let's analyse how much of an increase is needed and when to implement it, or whether we can do something else that avoids the need for a hard fork, because hard forks are messy and shouldn't be kneejerked into.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:31:24

Bitcoin Cash is different to Bitcoin.
There are ways to protect yourself from your coins being stolen. Mostly it boils down to holding your private keys somewhere safe.

Thanks.  TIL.


Any database can be auditable, if you give the auditors access.   If you're only going to allow a centralised group to update it, then you lose any reason to use a blockchain instead of a regular database.  Just represent everyone's transactions in an Oracle (or whatever) database, and give out read access like M&amp;M's.  Although, as mentioned previously, the downsides of letting everyone snoop on everyone else's activity, might have no corresponding upside if the whole point of the centralised system is that you trust the globocorp at the centre anyway.


By whom?  Managed to what criteria?  How do I get to be one of the people who manage the fees?  How do I get to be one of the people who sets the criteria by which the managers are to manage them?

When your coins are in teh lightning network, they are in a multisig wallet, to which only you and your counterparty have access, and the smart contract records how much of the wallet's coins are yours and how much are theirs.

I've made no such suggestion.  I merely suggested that "spying" (OP's choice of word) on Andreas to see what he does with money gifted to him, with no precondition, by his supporters, is a vile and dickish thing to do.  I still stand by that.
You tried to claim it was accountability, but I take it that your current attempts to make this personal against me now means that you've dropped that bogus line.
I haven't acted high and mighty.  I've called out spying on what someone does with funds given to them with no precondition is a dick move.  I've made no claims at all about myself.
Seriously, whatever your motivation in defending OP's dick move here, just accept that we have different opinions on it.  I think it's a vile, dick, stalker move.  You think something else.

They can't.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:43:19
It's most certainly *not* accountability.  Accountability would be ensuring that someone is actually using funds they sought for the purpose for which they sought them.
Andreas never sought these funds for any purpose.  They were given to him, unconditionally, by a range of individuals and organisations.  The funds are his, and he is free to do with them exactly as he wishes.
Maybe we just have different moral compasses, but I think it's utterly disrespectful to attempt to start a "Let's spy on this great guy does with his money" discussion on the net.  To me, it's vile stalker shit.

Right. And maybe there will be a modest increase at some point. Right now, people can choose wallets and exchanges that use segwit which allows for more transactions per block.

Take 0.5% of your available cash and buy in quickly.  The price will then drop hard.  Now, use 99% of your original wedge to buy the dip.

@_date: 2017-12-19 23:38:00


If you set modest goals that we would have 100x more people (or things), each making 100x more transactions, each processing 100x faster than they were on 1MB, pre-segwit Bitcoin, then you need 1,000,000 MB blocks to be downloaded and processed by every node on the network.  That's going to be beyond the ability of most Bitcoin users, and will see nodes becoming a centralised trusted third party service.
And if we dear to dream of an internet of things transacting with each each other in addition to use mere humans, then we're going to need even greater capacity.
I agree with you, though, that right now, BCH transactions can be cheaper and faster than Bitcoin, but the same could be said of Litecoin, which is using better technology, and can also take advantage of Lightning. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:05:34

@_date: 2017-12-08 00:10:06
This is a FAQ. 
Each exchange has its own pool of buyers and sellers and they determine the price.
If, for example, it takes a seller 1 day to withdraw fiat from Exchange A and a week from Exchange B, the seller is likely to charge more on Exchange B where their funds will be tied up for longer.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:21:47
Onchain won't scale to do that. Bitcoin will serve globally, it just needs the coming tech.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:13:28
No. You make an on chain transaction once to open a channel and once again to close  it. In between, the coins could change hands a hundred times without requiring onchain transactions and fees.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:41:33
Right. So, the lesson for you ought to be to not to try to send funds you don't have.
This is a pretty sketchy series of transactions. Whether you're complicit in something, or just the chump at the end, only you know.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:44:29


True, and every transaction with more outputs than inputs increases it.
My guess is that as time passes, there is likely to be more of the second scenario than the first - especially as more and more new people join the network.
But that is just a guess.  If there's any evidence to the contrary, I'm all ears.

increasing block size isn't a solution *now*.  A hard fork takes months to implement and requires support from the same wallets and folks who are already being dickheads about not supporting segwit.
Hard forks are, well, hard, and should not be undertaken lightly.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:22:39
This means that if the transaction has not been processed, then the coins are still yours.
Your wallet software might show them as spent, but that's just because your wallet knows that you have created the transaction.  if you imported your private key into a different wallet, that new wallet would not know that you have previously tried to send the coins.
You could then redo the transaction from your new wallet, this time using a higher fee so it gets processed sooner.  In that case, when the original transaction eventually gets processed, it will be rejected as a double spend.
It may be that your current wallet can help you do this without needing to move to a second one.  Look for a "RBF" or "Replace By Fee" feature.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:42:05


OK, so the key benefit that you started out with (a central authority that everyone could trust, so that merchants would sign up in a heartbeat) is already being set aside - because we *don't* trust them absolutely.  In the centralised world, you would have specialist auditors and regulators to watch the bankers.
How does the auditing work in your example?  If I see something I am suspicious of in the chain, what do I do about it?  Am I still running a node?  Or is that old hat if the rules (and therefore, presumably the code) are being centrally managed?
A Board of Directors?  Votes?  How do you manage all of that?
Sorry, I've given this all the time I can afford, I'm out.

First off, that transaction is time stamped yesterday, not 3 days ago.
Second, the wallet trying to send coins in that transaction doesn't have any to send.  It's waiting on an earlier transaction to confirm.
Third, that earlier transaction involves another sending wallet that doesn't have any funds, as it is waiting on an earlier earlier transaction.
Fourth, that earlier earlier transaction is another send from a wallet with no funds.
I stopped checking after that.

Core devs have implemented Segwit on the live network. Some wallets have enabled it. Core devs are working on it, having been forced to shelve it temporarily to implement protections against S2X.
Many independent projects are working on Lightning which will have a huge influence on transaction speeds and fees.
However impatient you are to see progress, claiming that nothing is being done is just silly.

I've shown (well paraphrased Antonopolous) how 1TB is not an based on an isane premise.
Comparing to Visa falls short of the 'banking the unbanked' premise, and anyway Visa claims to be able to process 65,000 transactions per second.
We could argue about the actual limit of onchain transactions and how much decentralisation drops off at each increase in blocksize, but the facts remain that there is a limit and there is a decentralisation effect and there is a better altnernative already at release candidate stage.

I'm not sure what you see as the missed opportunity. We should have wasted months on a contentious hard fork just to increase blocksize instead of focusing on lightning and core GUI support for segwit?
The missed opportunity is wallets and exchanges not supporting segwit.

Let me explain why I think it is.  Maybe I have misunderstood something.  Say I invest $5,000 in your scheme, and you add your $1,000 to make it $6,000.  For ease of numbers, let's imagine an exchange rate of $12k to the BTC.  So our $6k has just bought us 0.5 Bitcoin.  You own 10%.  So, **your $1,000 just bought you 0.05 Bitcoin.**
What if you didn't have this scheme, and you just used your $1k to buy Bitcoin.  **Your $1,000 would have bought you 0.08 Bitcoin.**
Am I missing something?

If you buy , say .005 Bitcoin for your money, then no matter what value the market places on it, you still have .005 Bitcoin.  If the market decides that 1 Bitcoin is worth nothing your 
005 is worth nothing.  If the market decides that 1 Bitcoin is worth $1,000,000 then your .005 Bitcoin is worth $5,000.  In either case, the valuation could be different tomorrow, but no matter what the value is, you still have .005 Bitcoin until you decide to exchange some or all of it for cash, goods or services.. or give it away.

Nah.

When you issue new dollars, they are identical to existing dollars. You have added to the number of dollars that exist.
When you fork a new alt from Bitcoin, they are NOT new Bitcoins, they are a different thing, with a different value. You have not added to the number of Bitcoin that exist.
Whether or not your new alt has any value will be determined by the market.

I think that this is the basis of your confusion.  The buyer is not the exchange.  The exchange is the facilitator between the buyer and the seller.  The exchange is neither the buyer nor the seller.
When you bought your coin, you placed a buy order on the exchange.  Someone else had a matching sell order.  The exchange was the middleman, transferring your fiat to the seller's account and transferring their coin to your wallet.

The top 100 addresses thing is posted here about once a week, which seems more than enough to me.

Your tone suggests that wallet intransigence on segwit is to be taken for granted, and that the only way to move is to demand poor architecture in core as a solution.  If, in fact, you are actively chasing wallet companies to play their part in taking advantage of existing technology, that's great. But are you?
Killing bcash ought not to be a priority for Bitcoin. Making Bitcoin a scaleable platform for the future ought to be. And that's happening with Segwit, Lightning, Schnorr, MimbleWimble etc.

All of which should be anticpatible in a large network.  Some nodes will operate for free as enthuisiasts just want to help the network.  Others will indeed likely charge for their services, but with low barriers to entry it seems reasonable to assume that there will be competition between node operators on price, service, availability, etc.  
As to whether or not you need a money transmitter license to operate a multisig wallet in a Lightning node, I guess people have widely different expectations here, but at the very least this will vary by jurisdiction.

Interesting tale from 4 years ago, about someone doing something different to what we're talking about.
In his case, the apparent issue was that he couldn't know that the postal recipient of his phyisical coins was the same as the person who owned the wallet that paid for them.
With a lightning node this doesn't apply since you are merely trading within a multisig wallet.  Unless you're aware of someone being shutdown by the feds for operating a multisig wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:54:46
A hard fork is a risky undertaking and it's not 'almost no work'.
It woul require months of planning to ensure that the ecosystem - wallets, exchanges, miners, nodes were all prepared.  It would probably trigger contentious debate between those who support the change and those who don't.  It would set the clock back on testing od the Lightning network. It would probably delay, again, segwit GUI support in the core client.
And after all of that, it might be rejected by the Bitcoin community through their refusal to update their nodes.
Additional capacity is already available through segwit. You should already be using this.
And if you really really want to use big blocks until Lightning is available, there was already a fork to enable them.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:12:29
Segwit is already live. If your wallet doesn't support it, change your wallet.
There is no committed date for LN yet, but 2017 was a breakthrough year with alpha versions successfully doing cross-implementation transactions on the live network. I would be surprised if people aren't using a beta in the first half of next year.

The basic premise is bogus, as I tried to show you above.
Lightning doesn't somehow grant businesses and credit facilities to "issue bitcoin".  It just doesn't.
I don't have "blind faith" in Lightning.  I think it's the first move in really scaling Bitcoin on a second tier.
It's unfortunate that there is some completely bogus FUD about "Fractional Reserve", companies issuing Bitcoin, and (as some other poor deluded soul mentioned here) "LN coins".  It's unfortunate that you are somehow bought into it, and are insisting that someone prove to you that there are no invisible monsters under the bed.

I asked if transactions were completing in seconds on BCH, and you said "yes", and offered 0-conf.
That's a little bit of misdirection.  A 0-conf transaction is not complete, and there is no guarantee that it will complete.  It may be a double-spend, it may be dependent on a previous unconfirmed transaction, any number of things could intervene to stop a 0-conf transactions from becoming a confirmed transaction.
On the other hand, a Lightning Network transaction can be complete and finished in seconds.
It's not a like for like comparison.

I don't fully follow your natural progression.  Any two parties can create a channel, at the cost of just an on-chain transaction.  That channel can then be used for many off-chain transactions.  Closing the channel will incur another channel.
Anyone who opens a channel, will be entitled to share it and entitled to charge for sharing.
So, the answer to your original question of is there an way to create decentralised payment channels, there absolutely is.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:24:33
You might consider it *safe* but it's not a complete transaction, and there's no way of knowing without a confirmation if a transaction is (just to pick one example) a double spend, for example.
Lightning has been demoed on both test and livenet.  When it is launched on livenet, your tongue-in-cheek assessment that it's almost as good as BCH will be even more laughable than they are now.

If you want big blocks, you can have them.  They exist on other coins.
We already had to divert development effort from the Core plans in order to protect Bitcoin users from S2X.  I don't think it would be appropriate to divert them once again to push out a poor design (even as a temporary fix), because development and testing does take time.  You also have to give a heads up to exchanges and miners etc, and then you get into whether or not the community will actually accept the change or whether the miners and node runners will reject the new rules.
I completely understand the logic of your position.  I just don't agree that it's what we need to be doing right now.

It's a development on top of Bitcoin, which will greatly open the prospect of Bitcoin not only replacing fiat for smaller purchases, but also delivering stuff that fiat simply can't do, like micro payments
If you subscribe to the view that that everything has to be onchain, then you have to consider the inevitable centralisation that springs from ever growing blocks.  Some of the proponents of strictly onchain alts propose that mere mortals shouldn't bother running nodes.  For them, the centralisation of block validation, along with centralised mining, centralised exchanges and centralised point of sale systems to convert your coin to fiat for the retailer is the vision.

The next step is to open a channel to the lightning network. You *could* specify a node to open your channel with, but it's easier to let the wallet do it automatically.
Now you have to wait for this channel opening to be processed on chain. Block times on mainnet are unpredictable, but you might see an hour or two go by before the channel is open.

The network doesn't require more nodes because of segwit.
More nodes secure the protocol. If there were no non-mining nodes, then the miners would have sole control over the bitcoin protocol. And that would not be a dangerous centralisation.

Not true.  There is no "IOU".  There is only Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is building the platform for mainstream adoption.  I'd far, far rather wait for a decent solution rather than implement fast, bad solutions.
With crypto still in its infancy, it's laughable to talk about Bitcoin having missed its shot.
That said, if you woul prefer to use some other crypto now and have places that accept that alt, go for it. Nobody is forcing you to use Bitcoin now.
And just for the record, the only time when Bitcoin transaction fees spike is when it's effectively being DDOSed through a spam attack.  A typical transaction can now make the next block or two for less than $7. And while that's nowhere close to where it will get down to with Lightning, it's already way way down from where it was at the height of the attack and it's falling. 
Other cenralised coins can charge less, but I fail to see why we need them.

I use it to pay for a VPN, where I would rather not have my credit card details stored.
Other than that, I don't use Bitcoin for small purchases.  I don't really see the point in going through the sequence of
1.  Convert fiat to Bitcoin at an exchange
2  Convert Bitcoin to the fiat (that the coffee shop actually wants) using some point of sale processor
It's easier to avoid the palaver and just give the coffee guy the fiat he wants.
Even if the Bitcoin fees transaction fees were zero, and I was "only" paying the exchange fees, while either me or the coffee guy paid the fees charged by his payment processor... it just seems a bit pointless to me, when I am paid in fiat and he wants to be paid in fiat.

We see complaints about low fee transactions taking a week or more to confirm.
One week is just over 1,000 blocks. 10 times faster would be confirmation in 100 blocks. 100 times faster would be 10 blocks.
That's still nearly 1.5 hours to confirm - like I said, a modest improvement.  
If you think that 100x the number of users or 100x the number of transactions per user is beyond what Bitcoin should be architected for, I'd be intetested to hear why. In any case, you could drop either of these 100's to 10 and change the 100x speed tp 1,000x to aim for next block confirmation.  You still end up with terabyte blocks.

You could, but if the transactions are being controlled centrally, it would be far more efficient to just provide an API to allow the database to be queried by anyone, instead of maintaining multiple copies of the same database.
But if the database is centrally managed and that trusted central authority is preventing the double spend, why would you need to share everyone's current balance and transaction history with everyone else?

1.  Yes.  You are urged to remind them of this.
2.  It's just a guess.  There are no hard dates on when it will be officially launched, but it's effectively in alpha mode now with live cross platform tests done on the production network.  I would be surprised if it's not available in beta form (at least) in the first half of next year.
3.  I have no idea.  But it would seem safe to guess it would be a fraction of what people and their wallets are currently paying on-chain, especially when it gets spammed.
5.  When you open a channel on lightning, you are creating a shared multisig wallet with another party.  This wallet needs to contain some coins.  Either all from one of you or from both of you.  The ownership of those coins between the two of you is tracked off chain until the channel is closed and you settle it on-chain.
So, you could open a channel with the coffee shop and put $100 worth of coin into it.  All the coins are yours.  Then you can keep transferring coin ownership to the shop every time you buy a coffee, until you have spent all the coins you put in originally. That's what I meant by you "no longer own any of those coins", and the same as what you meant by "as long as my balance in this channel is positive".
Opening a channel with each individual you trade with *might* get you lower transaction fees, but it could tie up more of your coins in the various channels you open.  Overall, it's better to make more of a mesh network where you and all of your retailers (and maybe all of your customers) are connected indirectly to each other through the network.  You can trade with multiple second parties through a single channel to this network.

The opportunity cost is something most hodlers are happy with already. Not everyone is trying to flip their coins daytrading.

We're not. It's been frequently discussed.
Running a business in multiple currencies always brings with it an exchange rate risk.
That's why most businesses that 'accept Bitcoin' never touch it. Instead they use a point of sale conversion utility to allow the customer to sell their Bitcoin and give fiat to the shop.
In that case, all the risk is transferred to the customer. Say the customer 'pays' in Bitcoin the equivalent of $100 for a parrot that turns out to be dead. If they return the parrot tomorrow, they get $100 back. If that $100 only buys half the Bitcoin it did yesterday, then the shopper has lost Bitcoin.

The idea is that it's a network. Think seven degrees of separation. Alice open a channel with Bob. Not only can Alice send coins to Bob. She can also send coins to Charlie if Bob has a channel with Charlie. Alice can send coins to Denise too, if either Bob or Charlie has a channel with Denise.. and so on.

1. Because some wallet providers are resistant to it. I think it was Blockchain.info who said they were ready and waiting for Segwit last January, but months after Segwit was deployed they still haven't implemented.
2. You can avail of lower fees now just by switching to a segwit wallet. I would guess that Lighning is no more than 3-6 months away. No one wants a launch failure like Segwit2x.
3.  What happens to fees is up to users. They set the fees. Yes, when Lightning launches, you can still do on chain transactions.
4. LN transactions do not need to be mined, only the opening and closing of channels.
5. This will depend on the nature of your relationship with your channel partner.  If you have a long relationship with them with coins moving in both directions you might leave the channel open for a long time. On the other hand, if all the coins flow from A to B, then when A no longer owns any of the coins, B will likely want to close it.

This shows a bit of a misunderstanding.  Who do you expected to "buy them back"?  Owning bitcoin is like owning a stock, or a commodity or anything else.  If you decide you want to sell, you can sell it for whatever you can get for it. Nobody has the responsibility to "buy it back".
If you own Amazon stock, you will have no trouble selling it.  If you own stock in some company which is bust, then you won't find it as easy.
There are regular swings in Bitcoin's price.  People and institutions buy and sell it all the time. 
From everything you've said, I suspect that maybe Bitcoin is not for you.

I'm not close to the dev team, so my speculation is no better than yours. There has only been a single minor release since the scramble to protect user funds from S2X, and that focused on bugfixes and performance improvements. I'm pretty sure that the next major release will cover segwit GUI changes. In the meantime, there are other wallets so I don't share your sense of outrage on this. 
It would delay the GUI still further if they were to gamble on another hard fork now just to increase block size. Hard forks are a big deal with a user community as wide and diverse as the Bitcoin community. You don't get to just push out a new hard fork, you make it available and hope that it is universally adopted. And if there's one thing Bitcoin doesn't need right now it's a few months on another fractious civil war, trying to build consensus for a change that not all of us want right now. And to suggest that we have yet another one less than a year later to undo the previous one... well that just seems like eye-swivelling lunacy to me.
We should be confident enough in the future of Bitcoin and its future enhancements to be able to accept that maybe it's not ready yet to be the game changer it will be, and accept that paying for all your purchases with Bitcoin isn't practical today. 
And we shouldn't be bounced into making bad architectural decisions on the back of a network attack.
But if you don't share my views, as plenty don't, there are many hundreds of alternative coins.

You seem to be mischaracterising what I said in order to refute a point I didn't make.
I never said that anyone must run a full node. I expressed the opinion that in a peer to peer system you want to facilitate anyone who chooses to become a peer (run a full node).
You suggested that centralising of nodes is a good and healthy thing, thus recommending a model where users are not peers, but are clients of peers.  Users in such a scheme rely completely on others to decide on the rules of the network and to validate against those rules.
This the model behind BCash, paypal, visa and a whole raft of other financial systems. It's not the model that got me excited about Bitcoin.
But if it floats your boat, then the  BCash token is there waiting for you.  You don't need to turn Bitcoin into another one.
I only mentioned Bittorrent as you asked for an example of a peer to peer system. Your refutations of the peer to peer nature of bittorrent are somewhat disingenuous. As a bittorrent user, I can make decisions about how/if I seed the linux distro I download, but I still run the client.  I still have the options to control how I interact with my peers on the network.

Then you're concentrating the decision-making on Bitcoin rules into fewer and fewer hands.
Imagine only miners run nodes.  Suppose a bunch of the bigger mining pools decide that they would like a higher reward per block?  They fork the code to give themselves that higher reward.  When the fork activates, their nodes will be configured to accept the new rules.  The job is done, they get their higher reward.

That's a bit silly though.
Craigslist sellers should not be treating on-channel payments as full and final until they have multiple confirmations.  With 0-conf, you just don't know that the payment will ever be confirmed.  It's a simple idea.  
Even with the low volumes on BCH, the only way you know if the coins you have been sent are not a doublespend and can safely be considered yours are when you have those confirmations.

If you rely on miners to mine transactions and to decide the ruleset for what constitutes valid transactions, and if a single company manufactures most of the mining gear (with patented technology) and that one company operates one of the biggest mining pools and is an investor in a few of the others, then you need to have an extremely elastic definition of what decentralised means to consider that 'relatively decentralised'. Relative to what?? Amex?
And if you support the insistance that all transactions happen on chain, then you cede all power to this company.  Why not just use paypal?
BCH could in theory use LN, although unilateral channel closures could be more of a risk than with Segwit and Bitcoin.

Standard tactic of misrepresenting the case against and then burning the strawman. Leading with price of hard drives kinda makes that agenda clear.
If you really, genuinely, want to know why Big Blocks are a centralisation vector, then Google is your friend.
On the other hand, if you just think Big Blocks are the answer, then yay... you can use Bcash, it already has them, and you can just trust that Wu, Ver, Fakesat, and that guy behind Ali are making all the future decisions with your best interests at heart.
As Andreas points out, if you drop Segwit and just go with blocksize, then you're screwed. Think transactions are too slow on 1MB segwitless blocks, aim for 100 faster. Want more adoption, aim for 100 times more users, each doing 100 times more transactions ( so not just hodlers, but paying parking, vending machines...).
Still pretty modest on the adoption front, but now your block is 100 x 100 x 100 x 1MB or 1TB.  That's a lot for any node to download and verify in 10 minutes.
0-conf is about as useful as an out of state check.

* Not a central bank issued bitcoin, it's a central bank issued (Nueveo) Sol
* Not an "authentic" bitcoin, or any kind of bitcoin.  It's a different coin with one face smoothed down and a bitcoin logo placed on it

Cool, as a family man, I guess maybe my responsibilities are different to yours.  Let's leave that aside for now.


The argument, more generally, is that if you obfuscate the private key, you need a reliable way to retrieve it.


By saving the alteration scheme elsewhere, you have now basically two pieces of stored information.  Either of them on their own will not retrieve the key.  In terms of secret sharing, as I mentioned earlier, this is a 2,2.  2 pieces of information, 2 needed to retrieve the key.


Yup, and that's why it's good to build in redundancy.  A 2,3 SSS lets you store three different numbers, any 2 of them will allow you to extract the key.  So if one safe place burns down, or you forget where it is, you're covered with the others.  3,5 would allow 2 out of your 5 safe places to disappear, and you would still be able to get your key.
So, at least you've recognised the issues with your scheme.  I've shown you an alternative that doesn't have those issues.
But really, how you store your keys is your own business.  So do whatever you feel comfortable with.

I suspect you may be working under one misunderstanding.
Removing your coins from an exchange is not the same as pulling your investment.
You transfer cash into an exchange account, put in a buy request, and you end up with bitcoin in an account on the exchange.  The exchange holds your coins on your behalf, but you don't actually have them.  If the exchange disappears or is hacked (and they are a BIIG target for hackers), your coins might simply disappear.  The only reason to have coins on an exchange is if you want to be able to sell them quickly.
If you plan on just holding and watching the fiat value of your bitcoin rise over time, the smart thing is to transfer the coins to a wallet which is in your control.  Now, no matter *what* happens to the exchange, your coins are as safe as your own security measures.  And there are lots of guides out there on "cold storage" techniques and tools to store your coins securely.
When you decide to sell your coins, you can transfer them back to an exchange.
Yes, you can day trade bitcoin transferring it to/from fiat currency or other alt coints, and trying to profit from the fluctuations in those values.  You might succeed or you might lose your shirt.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:10:39
No, sorry. I'm in the EU. I don't think there's any guiding to do other than getting BOA to explain to you why they are rejecting a valid IBAN. Might be because it's foreign. Might be because it's a bitcoin exchange.

Right, so I give you a piece of paper that I say is legal tender in Uzbekistan, Peru or Botswana.  How do you know it's real, and what it's worth?  Hurry up, there's a line of other people behind me waiting to order their coffee.  There's no point in closing your shop to go to the bank.  You'll just tell me to get lost until I can pay in whatever form of paper and coin you trust.  Trust in a money issuer is a local thing.  Hell, with different banks in the UK all printing their own sterling, I've had Northern Ireland notes refused in London, even though they are both legal tender sterling.
Trust, in other words, is fine where it exists.

Trusted paper and metal disks work well locally when both parties have a shared trust in the issuer.  But distance and unfamiliarity break down that trust.  If you run a store in the US and I show up with some paper and coins that I claim is currency from Uzbekistan, will you trust it?  Will you accept it?  Or if I write you a check on my Uzbeki bank account, will you accept that?  In both cases, I'm going to be told to GTFO.  I'm going to have to find somewhere to convert my paper and discs into something you do trust.  If you don't accept Bitcoin, I can do the same.  Or I might just pop into your competitor down the street who is happy to accept Bitcoin.  I suspect I would have to walk a lot further to find a "Uzbeki Soms accepted here!" sticker in a store window.

Arbitrage between exchanges is certainly possible.
Usually, there's some reason for the difference however.   A higher dollar price might indicate that it's more difficult to get those dollars back out of the exchange, for example.

The success of your decision will be determined by what happens the price.  None of us knows what will happen.
If you place a stop loss, then you are limiting your exposure if bitcoin crumbles and stays below your limit for a while, allowing you to buy back in at a lower price when the time is right.
On the other hand if the drop below your limit is only temporary, you may find yourself chasing the price back up the chart to get back in.
If you just hodl, you take no loss in your BTC holding.  The fiat value may change, which may be important if you plan on cashing out in the short term, and you may have some opportunity cost if you could have used the dip to increase your BTC holding.
There's no "right" answer here.  You've got to weigh up what your needs are and the risks of each option.  You haven't given us enough information to make that call for you, and nor should you.  It's pretty personal stuff.
I'm hodling, because I'm in this for the long term.  Most of my coins were bought years ago, and I have no plans to cash out anytime soon.  But that's me.  Your needs may be different.  
If I could try to offer you some advice, it would be this.  If your horizon is short term and you were planning on cashing out soon anyway (maybe you have urgent needs for cash), then do a stop loss to protect your profit.
If you're here for the long term, then riding out any downswings might be a better option because if you just want to use any dips to increase your BTC holdings, then you may lose out when trying to time the market.
Others will offer the opposite advice, and that's just as vaild.  It's up to you.

Never said it was.  But if I hand over a note at the store, they still check it to make sure it's legit.  Having done that, they then drop it into their till.  And later on, they carry it to the bank and deposit it.
If I pay with Bitcoin, they can validate it and sweep it into their wallet in a single action.  
For folks in the US, I guess could also draw the comparison with writing a check and lying about the value of that piece of paper.  But that's less of a global thing as most of us have walked away from them.

You can send bitcoin directly to any wallet you have the public address for.  You will save the exchange fees, but you will still pay the miner fees.
You could meet up with someone, take their cash and wait there together until the transfer is confirmed.
Trying to do this from a greater distance, some element of trust will be involved.  The other party needs to send you fiat, you need to send them bitcoin.  Who makes the leap of faith to go first?
Whatever you do, do NOT accept paypal as payment.  They are notoriously willing to roll back the payments.  He pays you in paypal, you send him the coin, he challenges the transaction in paypal, they reverse the payment.  You have no cash and no coin.

I think I replied in a little haste to your question about accepting BTC and not converting.
What you propose is really important and was something I actively sought out with no success years ago. Sticking some third party trader tool into your checkout so I can pay in BTC but you still get USD is not accepting bitcoin.
Actually taking the BTC and looking for suppliers to accept it is the real deal. It means you are trying to expand the ecosystem and you can refund my coin should the need arise.
It's a lot to take on, though. Running a store in two currencies simultaneously brings extra overhead. And finding suppliers who accept btc may not be trivial either.
Best of luck with this noble venture and feel free to keep me informed.

People dumping either coin for the other will create high(ish) value transactions.  With a smaller volume, these will stand out more on BCH.

The UK hasn't left the EU yet, and the terms of that leaving have yet to be defined.  There's a lot of trade between the UK and other EU states that both sides will have a vested interest in protecting during negotiations.  Nobody has a clue what the long term impact of brexit will be.
Far Right Frexiteer Marine Le Pen had her ass handed to her in the elections, and Macron is a reformist.  France already has a huge influence in the EU, so will be in a better position to secure key reforms for his electorate.  The impact of any such reforms is unknown.
Greece is pretty inconsequential in terms of the EU economy at this point, and rumours of Italy's death have been somewhat exaggerated.
I don't see any "collapse" of Europe.  Nor even of the EU.  Nor even of the Euro.
But, if somehow the Euro and EU were to collapse, it would be replaced by intercountry agreements and I don't see the continent imploding as a result.  One impact that it might have would be that it would take longer for Bitcoin to become part of the financial establishment in all of those member states.

How long would it take you to get the Uzbeki note to  your bank and see the corresponding funds in your account?
How many minutes would all of the above take?  And could you do it all from behind the counter at your coffee shop?
What guarantee would you have that the bank would give you the same exchange rate tomorrow that you gave me at your till?
Edit:  Forgot this point:


A private company that can bankrupt tomorrow?  Or impose T&amp;C's that aren't printed on the note?  Or have no presence in my country?  OK.  Let's say they do.
So, they decide to issue a note for .001 Bitcoin.  You buy it from them for .001 Bitcoin.  And whoever you give it to (or whoever they give it to, etc etc) can present the note back to them for .001 Bitcoin.  To make this work, the company has to print the note in some high-tech fraud preventative way so that everyone who ever sees the note knows that it's genuine and not some ripoff.  Where does the cost of that high-tech secure printing come from?  Who pays for it?  Why?  (For simplicity, I'm ignoring the additional costs of marketing this note, the staffing required to sell them and buy them back, etc etc)

You say BitCoin goes up at "150%" a year.  I say it depends which year, and give you a little history.  But like I say, past performance is no guarantee of future returns.
If you assumed that bitcoin returns would continue in 2014 the same way they had in 2013, you would have been wrong.
If you assumed that bitcoin returns would continue in 2015 the same way they had in 2014, you would have been wrong.
If you assumed that bitcoin returns would continue in 2016 the same way they had in 2015, you would have been wrong.
In all cases, past performance would have been a shitty indicator of future returns.
I still say 3% growth per week is a hell of an assumption, even if we've just had a tremendous run.  But what do I care?  You're not planning for me.

If you buy through an exchange, the exchange has a record of who you are and at least one of your wallets. If forced to release that information to law enforcement, they can then track where the coins go from there.
You may leave other footprints that they can pick up too. Like if they subpeona data from some online service which shows your name or email address paying from another public address further along in the blockchain.
The blockchain doesn't know who you are but external data associated with certain address or transactions along the way do.
You can try to add some plausible deniability along the way through bitwashers, jumping on or off other chains, as well as off chain transactions.  But still with enough data and processing, they can find stuff to put together. 
But can they identify you from the blockchain alone? Nope.

Still looks like apples and oranges to me.  But maybe you've left some detail out.
I get that the $10k was a downpayment, with the remaining $70k coming from an interest-charging loan.  But the house is now paid off.  It was worth $80k, so he must have put in the remaining $70k and whatever interest and other charges had accrued on the finance, or the house would not now be paid off.
Maybe the piece I'm missing is where that $70+k came from?  Did he rent it out from day 1, so that every single payment came straight out of the rent?  He never had to reach into his pocket again for this house?  No unlet periods?  No fixtures and fittings to buy before he could rent it out first time?

So, he gives out a 1 BTC note in exchange for 1 BTC credit.  And he reaches into his own pocket for all the expenses involved in running this service, from which he earns exactly zero.

You've asked for some reasons why Bitcoin notes and coins aren't a thing.  I've tried to explain.  I fear I haven't succeeded.  But what the heck, I tried.

Bitcoin isn't "supposed to" peak at any particular value.  
There are people who make *guesses* about where and when the various peaks and troughs will be.  Good luck to you if you decide to put real cash behind those guesses. It's just like getting a tip on a horse race.
Should you sell now in the hope that you can buy back at a lower price, low enough to make it worth your while?  That's your choice.
You might get a better response at where they do more of the trading thing.

The price always varies by exchange.  In the runup to the 2014 crash, you could get a much higher price on MTGox than on any other exchange.  This was because while you could buy and sell your coins there, delays over fiat withdrawals and the risk that you might never see your fiat drove the price higher.

If we want to overanalyse, I guess the blockchain could be TCP/IP. On top of that are layered additional protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, telnet, ssh and so on, which could be currencies. On top of that can be layered additional standards like HTML, MIME, CSS which could represent maybe the lightning network... And when you have the technology stack, there are applications of the technology... guarded environments like AOL, Compuserve, open environments like the web as we know it... public sites, paywalls, private sites, extranets, intranets, tor, voip, video on demand, streaming, videoconferences,... and on and on and on...

You haven't shown how it's ANY better.


And why would anyone be willing to put in that money and effort to solve a problem that probably doesn't even exist, or worse to replace it with a worse problem.


That's a pretty generic statement.  It depends on the *cost* of the debt.  There are far cheaper ways to lend than to invent a whole new infrastructure to do it.  


It would take a massive amount of investment to convince a whole nation that PrivateCompanyWhichCouldGoBankruptInTheMorning PLC's IOU's are so worthy of trust that they need not even think about cashing them in.
Notes and coins are different to shop vouchers.  Shops make a profit from unredeemed vouchers.  Governments on the other hand, take a hit.  If they don't reissue new coins to replace all the 2c and 5c coins that have rolled down gutters, then shops can't give change, and the whole system starts to collapse.  That's why 1c coins are being phased out in the EU.  Governments can't afford to keep replacing them.  The same would apply to a company trying to run your scheme.  No-one will want your notes if they can't spend them because the shops can't give change.


By trustless, I meant that you don't need a trusted third party.  Like the issuer of your notes and coins.  That undermines the whole point of Bitcoin.  See the second sentence in the Bitcoin White Paper:


benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required** to prevent double-spending.
and also the first sentence of the conclusion in the white paper:


Users of bitcoin don't just "trust" the cryptography.  The cryptography is the mathematical proof.  Take away that and replace it with "official" notes and coins, issued by a third party, and you're better off using government-backed fiat instead of some random company.

Be careful where you hold your coin.  If you have left them on an online service, then what happens is up to them.
If you have the private key for your coin, then if you have 2 Bitcoin just before the fork, you will have 2 Bitcoin after the fork plus 2 of the other thing that forks off.
This doesn't necessarily mean double your dollars.  It means you have 2 of thing A and 2 of thing B and the the market will argue over the dollar value of each.

**Alarm 2** "Is Micro Hash a legal registered Company? Yes, Microhash is registered in United Kingdom under the registration number of 10225095".  Actually, that's the registration number of a company called [Benet Trading](
**Alarm 3** Benet's registered address is shared by multiple companies, suggesting it's a brass plate company set up on the cheap.
**Alarm 4** The domain name is registered by a John Bennet at a home address and not the registered business address of the company.
**Alarm 5** The company address given in the HTTPS cert is "Micro Hash Ltd" yet another UK address.
**Alarm 6** Micro Hash Ltd at this third address has a different company registration number 10858611.  It has a different director to Benet, and the company address is again a domestic house.
**Alarm 7** This address is also the registered address of NanoHash Ltd, with the same director listed.  Their website, nanohash.net is no longer available, just over a year after it was first registered.
That's even before the nonsense of their promised returns and the affiliate scheme model.

A $100 change in price from $4250 to $4350 is about 2.35%
That's a gross gain of 2.35%.  The cost of making that gain would be fees associated with two exchange transactions.  The fees will vary by exchange, but it's going to probably round that down to 2% at least.
So, execute your plan flawlessly and you might just get a 2% return.  Nifty eh?  $10 for you.
But if you get the timing wrong and you sell at $4350, but the price keeps going up... you could find yourself taking a big hit getting back in at a higher price, or waiting on the sidelines for the next dip that might or might not come.  Or maybe it comes when the exchange is down.
And of course while you're playing this game you're playing against all sorts of automated traders and you're not holding your precious coins safely in cold storage.
It might work out really well for you or it could blow big holes in your holding.  I'm happier to life the quiet life of a hodler.  Your mileage may vary.

Nowhere close to enough information there to properly inform an answer, and even if there was, we're just anonymous strangers, probably not qualified to give professional financial advice.
If you ask if many of us believe that the dollar value of bitcoin will increase over a few years, I'd guess that the consensus would be someplace between yes and hell yes.
But that's just one piece of the puzzle.  You also need to think about what putting that 10k (USD, I'm guessing) into bitcoin would mean for you now.  You need to look at what else you could be doing with some or all of that money - repaying debts, getting healthcare, home/car repair, education costs, buffer for sudden loss of income, etc etc
Sure, you could sell your coins anytime if you needed to pull the money out, but what if your emergency coincided with a bloodbath in the market, or what if it just crashes to zero?  Don't put into Bitcoin anything you can't afford to see disappear completely.

@_date: 2017-08-27 13:11:14
Early days is right.  
And in those early days, the only way that BCH has to attract miners is to drop difficulty.  The effect of this is that miners come in for a while and mine loads of mostly-empty blocks, claiming their rewards in terms of BCH coins, until the difficulty bumps again.  As a result of this strategy so far, there [are]( 16,548,050 BCH now in circulation versus 16,527,550 BTC.
So, in these early days, BCH is taking from the future just to survive today.  How long can it continue to eat into the remaining 4,451,950 at these "emergency" difficulties?  Eventually, the great BCH giveaway to miners will have to ease off, and difficulty will have to be allowed to grow.  When that happens, there are only two ways for BCH to attract miners - either the fiat value of BCH will have to skyrocket, or else the transaction fees will have to skyrocket.  With the current strategy of flooding BCH onto the market, it's hard to see how the fiat value will grow.

Hi the "exchange rate" will depend on where/how you buy your btc and the time.
As to any additional service charges etc, that will depend completely on the service you use to buy them.

I don't mind at all, but I'm no expert, so read anything I say at your peril :)
BCH relies on the same miners as BTC, and as observed, a sizeable chunk of (but far from all) miners follow mining rewards when deciding which one to mine.  With similar fiat value and similar difficulty, the miners might spread evenly between the two.
If they started out on those terms, and BTC started inching ahead of BCH in fiat equivalent, then a brief drop in BCH difficulty would bring miners on side, potentially long enough for a rally.  Certainly, it gave BCH a chance that they wouldn't have without it.

Oh, for the record, your paper wallet should not just be in one safe place either.  If you store a copy in a relative's home, or in a bank vault or something, make sure your solicitor knows.
You might be interested in the concept of secret sharing.  With this, you convert your key into multiple other strings.  To reconstruct the key you need all, or some of the others (you decide when you are setting it up).  eg a 2,3 variant would give you three keys which you could store in three different safe locations.  Any one of them is useless on its own.  You need two to reconstruct the original key.  This gives you redundancy in case one of your safe locations turns out not to have been so safe.

Just like currencies, stocks, gold, and pretty much everything else in the world.  The price is set by how much anyone is willing to pay for it.
The price of Bitcoin on any one exchange is set by the folks trying to buy and sell Bitcoin on that exchange.  The lowest price offered by anyone wishing to sell Bitcoin might be $4,100, the highest price offered by anyone offering to buy Bitcoin might be $4.050.  There's no trade until a buyer and seller agree on a price.  Say, $4,075.  Then *that* becomes the price of Bitcoin on that exchange. 
Note, the price is backwards-looking.  It tells you the price of deal that was done.  When the two guys above agree on $4,075 for *their* deal, there's no guarantee that you can buy or sell for that price immediately after.  
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:01:16
I think that trusting one exchange with by banking details is a lesser evil than trusting anonymous Bitcoin buyers not to scam me and trusting them to not leave my data lying about on their computer.
I don't know *what* my bank would do if someone asked for a chargeback.  As far as I know SEPA supports chargebacks in some fashion.  Personally, I don't have a strong motivation to find out.
A normal person who just wants to buy BTC will probably not do any harm to me.  Do I want to take the risk that nobody I deal with is a scammer?  Nope.

It's debt.  It's an IOU.  He's taken on a loan.  For 1 BTC he has given you a promise to pay the bearer 1 BTC, and in addition, he has payed for the design, printing, distribution, security, insurance, marketing, customer support, and general operation of the system whereby he takes out this loan.  In fact, he has not only taken on all of the above for the note he has issued, but also for the smaller denomination notes and coins that will be needed all around the country to make the system work.  
Add to that the risk of fraud as fake notes circulate. They might either be really, really good ones which means he has to redesign and reissue new notes, inviting everyone with the old notes to swap over - hoping his agents don't get fooled by fake notes.  Or they might be pretty poor ones, in which case he has to counter the reputational damage with more intense marketing to tell an audience of consumers and businesses who never asked for his scheme how to identify the fakes.
Take all of that out of the 1 BTC, or possibly .001 BTC, value of the note, and there won't be a whole lot left over to try to invest to make a profit out of the thing.  Even banks are currently offering close to, or below, zero interest on deposits these days. 
And all of this is just so that I can have some notes and coins that are nearly as useful as fiat, issued by a company trusted in some country, but presumably unknown and therefore untrusted in others.  Which means I might have to exchange my "French" BTC for "Austrian" BTC when I move around the EU.  Unless maybe there's some interoperability scheme where the French and Austrian companies trust each other and accept each other's notes, in which case his exposure is far greater than the notes he issued.
All of the above makes it pretty much certain that any enterprise embarking on this scheme will fail big and fast.  And the notes will quickly become worthless.
It's an insane scheme.  And I still see no benefit AT ALL, for ANYONE involved, over just taking fiat (which is already there and trusted) out of an ATM and handing it to the shop (which already is familiar with the note and has already change for it).


You're not good at making assumptions. :)

I'm sure there are good and bad in every field.  I've never studied technical analysis myself, but I've seen many posts here calling out candlesticks, heads, shoulders, knees and toes or whatever other terms there are.  Frequently, they call out predictions which don't seem to be borne out.  But, maybe the good analysts don't shout out their analysis here, or maybe they have the patience to ride it out if they called the dip, or the rise, too early.  Playing long gives you that option, compared to this poor shorter.  But, I'm sure that there are others who have made money shorting well.
Speaking personally, I know my track record at trading is pretty poor.  I'm solidly hodling my coins  
I've kept a small stash of alts that I got from some airdrop, and I've been trading a little with those, and so far it confirms that I still suck at trading.

You're not addressing any of the security concerns.  And I don't think you even realise it.  Here are a few scenarios, but these are just the really, really obvious ones.  There are lots of other threats to consider as well.
By running this service from a single webserver, if a hacker gets access to it, they have access to everything.  
They could replace your public address with theirs, so that whenever a user makes a deposit, it goes to the hacker's wallet and not yours.  They could edit the code so that when a user cashes out, the funds go to the hacker's wallet and not to the users.  The hacker could create their own account, and put in a billion in-game points and withdraw it. 
If you're leaving your private key on the server to automatically send funds, they could take it.
They could do any or all of this, either openly, or without leaving a trace, just stealing your private key and waiting until they decide the time is right to empty your wallet.
And that's just on the bitcoin front.  Handling bitcoin on an inappropriate architecture would be like catnip to these guys.  Once they're in and have helped themselves to yours and your customers coins, they might also look at the bread and butter stuff like ID harvesting, pushing malware from your servers, etc
This is not a service for one guy to run on a virtual server someplace.  Not only will you be ripped off, but your customers will too.

One of the big things we have to face down sometime is the concept of sat/byte as the cost of moving funds. It's too opaque.
If I want to move X bitcoin from one place to another, the cost should be a function of X, not a function of the history of how you came to have X in the first place.

Interesting story, but you may have been misled someplace.
Bitcoin itself is not completely anonymous.  The public nature of the ledger means that any coin can be followed from wallet to wallet depending on the information at your disposal, you might be able to put a few things together.  For example, if I pay some coin into your wallet, I have your public address I can monitor to see if you move the coins etc.  It's not completely transparent, but it's not 100% anonymous either.
Additionally, much of the world has signed up to money laundering standards, which means that all exchanges (as well as all banks, stock exchanges, credit unions, etc etc) will need to verify your real identity when creating an account for you, so your real identity is recorded there.  That's not a bitcoin requirement, it's a regulatory requirement.
You can buy bitcoin anonymously through localbitcoins, for example, but there's a premium associated with that.
I haven't dealt with bitpanda or coinmama, so I can't comment on them.  I use bitstamp.  Funds transfer is by SEPA so it can take a couple of days for funds to land in the exchange for trading.  Circle used to accept my debit card, but they pulled the service.
Keep going.  You'll find the service that meets your needs.

So your ability to support foreign customers with fiat is limited to your social life, but even then you would need to be up to date on the exchange rate.  Outside of that, the trust which you need in order to do business is gone, and you would turn the customer away.  
I guess the same would apply if "the first guy that thought of" issuing BTC notes lived in Uzbekistan?  Or are you anticipating hundreds of companies world wide all issuing their own designs of BTC notes and coins so that every country has a "local" BTC that they accept?
This all comes back to your assertion that with fiat you could close the transaction in 1 second instead of waiting for days.  In fact, that's a best case example of the "trust" system where customer gives you a note in the local currency.  Outside of that, it could take you days/weeks to get paid (or to find out that the note you accepted is a forgery).


Your sentence is still missing the word "by".  Paid by whom?  It looks like the customer needs to go to an ATM.  When they withdraw BTC, the amount they will be charged will cover the the issuer's expenses (cost of the ATM itself, rental cost of the location,  electricity and repairs, printing the notes on high security paper, secure delivery of the notes to the machine, government taxes, insurance to cover theft from the ATM, or of the ATM itself, or of customers ripped of by skimmers etc etc) plus the other company expenses such as promoting the BTC note, customer support, etc etc, plus some markup to make it worth the issuer's while... pay all of that on top of the actual BTC amount to be withdrawn.  Sounds like it could be an expensive withdrawal.
And what happens in the coffee shop, then?  I pay with my mBTC note.  Do I get my change in local currency, or does the coffee shop have the smaller denomination mBTC notes and coins already in the till... did they have to buy the coins?
How is ANY of this easier than just converting your BTC to local fiat at the ATM?  Who benefits from your system?

Buying and selling bitcoin is as easy or hard as buying stocks. International anti-money-laundering standards and legislation require institutions like stockbrokers, banks and bitcoin exchanges to have proof of id for all of their account holders.

@_date: 2017-08-17 09:30:30
You're not the only one with that perspective, but a lot depends on your time scales.  Everything fails or gets eclipsed eventually.
Take the wireless telegraph.  Did it have an inherent value?  Sure the hardware that tapped, beeped and punched the morse code had inherent value, just as the computers that process bitcoin do.  But could you use the radio waves to wallpaper your house, wipe your ass or decorate your fingers?  Nope, nope and nope.
But being able to send messages over the air was valuable in itself.  Just as being able to send money, person to person, through the internet is valuable.  
The telegraph didn't last forever and was eclipsed by newer technology, but did that make it a pyramid scheme?  Were those who invested in telegraph stocks sold a ponzi?  Nope and Nope.  Although, sure, those who got in earlier made more than those who got in later.
Sure, you won't find many bitcoin-only stores in the better-lit economy.  Why would you?  Wherever those stores are operating also has a national currency, and the store owner would be a fool not to accept that currency.  Adding bitcoin to his process (whether deeply integrated, or just with a BTC-USD conversion service at checkout) means that just by handling a second currency, he can now serve a worldwide audience.  As a customer, I can pay the BTC price, and I know there and then what the BTC price is (and, if I'm interested) what the price is in my local currency.  On the other hand, if the retailer just offers a USD price, and I have a Euro-denominated credit card, I won't know how much I am paying in my local currency until much later when the bank gets around to converting it.  There are exceptions, like Amazon, who will offer me a hard Euro price at checkout, but for the vast majority of retailers, that's not on offer, so non USD customers, don't really know what they are paying.  BTC removes that uncertainty.
Sure, the bitcoin economy has a ways to go, and while it runs in parallel with government-backed fiat it will always have some disadvantages to that fiat.  On the other hand it will have some advantages too.  You can't do "quantitative easing" in bitcoin.  Governments and banks can't just magically issue more of them as they see fit.  The maximum supply of bitcoin is finite and known.
It's a technology in its infancy.  Some of us believe it will come to fruition with more utility and acceptance being added year by year, and we think that its current price is a small fraction of what it will be worth in the future when the bitcoin ecosystem matures.
Are there day traders just looking to flip it quickly to profit from the up and down ticks in value?  Sure there are.  Just as there are trading every other currency, stock and commodity.
Could we be wrong?  Absolutely.  I'm not betting my entire future on it.  I'd be crazy to.  
Am I desperately trying to find new suckers to come in after me?  Nope.  I don't give investment/speculation advice to anyone, and I'm not in a hurry to find anyone to sell my BTC to.  If you don't think BTC is a good punt, then keep your money out.
I'm a hodler, and I'm here for the long term.  I also have what I think of as a "current account" or "checking account" in bitcoin, which I use for occasional purchases of stuff.  I pay for my VPN in bitcoin, for example.  It's the first thing I ever paid for in bitcoin, and was the reason for my first purchase of bitcoins many years ago.  I bought those bitcoins completely anonymously.  The seller had no idea who I was, he/she/it just got a public address and a €50 note in an envelope.  I got my bitcoin without ever knowing who from.  I used that to sign up to a VPN, who had no idea who I was.  Websites I visited, and anyone sniffing the traffic, had no way to identify me, my ISP or even my country.  That sort of anonymity was important to me from a personal perspective.  But to someone in a more repressive regime, that sort of anonymity could be the difference between life and death.
None of this may convince you that bitcoin is a simple bubble with no substance.  That's fine by me, I'm not here to convince anyone of anything.  I'm just offering my own perspective.
If bitcoin was to disappear tomorrow in a flurry of sales, I'd be disappointed andI'd miss its usefulness to me, but financially, I wouldn't be in a mess.  I've taken far worse beatings in the value of my pension fund, and the value of my house.  You know.  In the "real" economy.

If you can give someone cash, presumably you already have it in your pocket.  
So, to make things equal, let's say I have a paper wallet in my pocket. 
You can hand your $100 cash over to someone. If they know and trust you, they might accept it as genuine. In a store, they'll probably use whatever mechanism they use to verify the note is genuine before ringing it up in their till and later transporting it to a bank.
I can hand a 28.57 mBTC paper wallet over to someone. If they know and trust me, they might accept it as genuine. In a store, they'll sweep it into their wallet, verifying it with the same step.
Obviously less effort all around in the second scenario.
To get the paper wallet in your pocket does take some planning. Same for cash. Every time you want cash in your pocket you have to go to the ATM. With my wallet on my phone, I don't.

You have to provide ID, that's the law. The company you provide it to is strictly regulated on what it can do with that information. It's not shared with your average snooper.
If you want, you can avoid exchanges completely and deal person to person. I bought my first couple of coins by sending €50 and a public wallet address to a po box in another country. Neither of us knew who the other was. Of course, I paid a premium for this... less than 4 btc for my cash if I remember right.

I wasn't referring to you in particular, but about a perceived increase in people who want to buy BTC with PayPal.
The problem you face trying to find a seller, is that the seller faces all the risk.  After he sends you the coin, you might get the payment reversed by Paypal.  The seller can't reverse sending you the coin.
If you're genuine, that kinda sucks for you, but I hope you can see why sellers aren't lining up to sell on Paypal.
As to why a scammer might want a $12 purchase, maybe just to see who bites.

Buying bitcoin is, in fact, the opposite of selling it, which is what I was discussing.
In 2011, Bitcoin was relatively unknown, and almost certainly unregulated in your country.  The person who sold you Bitcoin wasn't trying to convert money to coin, they were trying to sell a digital asset for money.  Very different.  You couldn't be accused of laundering someone else's dirty money, if you weren't taking it from them.
The other party to that trade was taking that risk.
Also, just out of interest did you give your bank account details (branch code &amp; account number or BIC and IBAN) to that other party, or did you just give them a credit card number - something which again is very different?
I bought my first coins by sending cash and a public address through snailmail.  I had no idea who the other party was, other than a foreign PO box.  They had no idea at all who I was.  As a buyer, I took the risk that I would never get my bitcoin.  The seller took the risk that the cash I mailed them might be the proceeds of a bank heist or drug deal being tracked to their door by some law enforcement types.  With a trade of €50, the risk on both sides was pretty small.  And by sending cash instead of bank account details, I was limiting my risk to the €50 rather than risking the other party dipping their fingers into my account whenever they felt like it, or selling the details on the black market.

So now you are seeing weaknesses of paper and coins.  If I hand you a foreign note - Uzbeki, Indian, Mexican, whatever - it will take you weeks to get paid.  Not the "1 second" you mentioned earlier.
I still don't really understand who you expect to pay for the printing of these notes and coins.  The person buying the bill in the first place?  Or the person cashing it in?  Or is the "trusted company making money off both of them?

Blockstream themselves published a white paper describing Pegged Sidechains in [October 2014]( 
You can't patent what is already published. 
The idea put forward in this paper was enough to get people working on designs.
You can't patent a solution that someone skilled in the art would come up with, given the problem and a knowledge of the state of the art.
Developers have already been devloping pegged sidechains since at least 2015.
You can't patent what is already developed.
In fact, [here]( is Matt Corrallo helping someone to implement a pegged transaction, on a public forum, using code already in the public domain
You can't patent something already in the public domain.
What is applied for in this patent is *one implementation* of pegged sidechains.  Whether even that will be granted remains to be seen.

The line below reads:


I didn't see that as relevant because I wasn't quoting a USD/EUR figure.
But, to be fair, maybe if I want to go USD / BTC, they have to go USD / EUR / BTC, and maybe that's it's that USD / EUR conversion that skews the rate.
So let's bypass that USD /EUR conversion.
€3,860.29 buys me 1.00155312 BTC on Changelly
Meanwhile over on Bitstamp, 1 BTC would cost me €2,954
So whatever the reason is for their stiffing their fiat customers, it's not explained by some the USD/EUR exchange rate at their bank.

Good to hear your story. It's a nice counterpoint to all the people who passed when they had the chance to buy in the early days, or lost the coins they mined. 'I could be a millionaire now', they moan. It's far more likely that they would have cashed out sometime, just as you did.
In the 2013 runup, I pulled out a bit too. I was a bit overexposed and had some financial pressure, so at about $1200, I sold enough to take out most of the fiat I had put in and just left my profit ride. Since then, I've bought some more but mostly I hodl and I have no regrets at all for the coins I sold.

Buying a product is different from currency speculation.
That's why the refund should be in the currency I pay in.
If I pay in US dollars for something I later return, I wouldn't be happy to get a refund in Chinese Yuan.
If a retailer *chooses* to trade in multiple currencies, then they must take on the exchange rate risk.
On the other hand, if the retailer *chooses* to only trade in US dollars, then they need only refund my dollars. 
In either case, the retailer refunds in the same currency the deal was done in, no matter what has happened in the exchange rates between that currency or any other.

3.  Not knowing who you are, I put myself at risk of money laundering investigation

@_date: 2017-11-04 17:07:51
Let's look at how you do the exchange.  You find an online exchange service that you can send S2X to, and it will send you BTC.  You have 1 BTC and 1 S2X at the same address.
Your S2X are in that address on the S2X chain.  You send your S2X from that address to the address the service asks you to send them to.  They then send you BTC at whatever the exchange rate.  Maybe you send them 1 S2X, and they give you 0.15 BTC or whatever.  Sounds good, job done.
The problem is that the transaction where you sent your 1 S2X to the exchange service address is just as valid on the BTC chain.  So, without you ever asking for it, your 1 BTC could also be sent to the exchange service address. 
You had 1 BTC + 1 S2X.  You now have 0.15 BTC.
At this point you hope that the exchange service can find your Bitcoin and return it before too long...

You see the price change and you decide it's manipulation. That's your perception. The degree to which it's true is somewhat unknown.
Crypto currency is pretty much unregulated, so there's certainly opportunity for manipulation. I would suggest, though, that it's far easier to manipulate alts with much much lower market cap.
It's estimated that Satoshi owns/owned 1 million Bitcoin, out of about 17 million mined so far... far less than the percentage you imagine.

@_date: 2017-11-15 17:36:58
Totally get you.  You posted at a rather tense time.
I've no idea what happened to your attempt to send a transaction, and so far, you've given me no means to help you find out.
Maybe you've got a buggy wallet application, maybe the transaction processed fine, but hasn't reached the node that your wallet is using... Bitcoin is a distributed system, after all.
Again, any details would help.  Sending address, hash, even the name/version of the wallet you are using.

@_date: 2017-11-17 11:52:18
Sounds like a shit wallet, then. 
Fees are not calculated as percentage of the dollar value, but based on the transaction size.  It's not exactly transparent.  But the fee you were being quoted doesn't seem to match the actual network fee.  If your transaction is a typical 250 bytes, you seem to be charged about 250x the current rate.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:15:52
Starblocks is a test store from acinq.  When you auto create a channel using its wallet, you are being connected to the same lightning network that Starblocks is on.
I don't know the other app, but maybe it hooks you up with a different network on testnet?
If you look at your channel in Eclair, you can see the "remote node id".  Can you create a channel to that node in the other app?

But, regardless of the above, any attempt to ban control the conversion of fiat to/from crypto would just demonstrate the importance of holding some of your wealth outside of fit and those assets over which governments can wield control.  It would be a great advertisement for Bitcoin.

Short answer, no.
Long answer.
Bitcoin Core is an open source project to which anyone is free to contribute.  You can see some of the current contributors [here]( with links to tell you a little more about each of them.  You can also see the [github listing]( of who has contributed in the past year, or [all time](
Mostly, these folks have full time jobs, and some work for Blockstream.
Development discussions are online, with [transcripts published](
As of a few months ago, [4 people]( could actually commit changes to the code.  Of these, 1 appears to be a Blockchain employee.
You are of course welcome to Google stuff for yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:53:35

S2X is being forced on people.  I'm getting S2X that I didn't want.  I can't easily get rid of it, because it adheres to my precious Bitcoin.  And if the fork takes some of the value of my Bitcoin, and I can mitigate that damage by flogging off the S2x fork coin thing, then I want to do that to restore the fiat value of my hodling to as close as I can to what it was worth before the fork was forced onto the market.
The decent thing to do would have been to hard fork and try to convince people of the value of "I can't believe it's not Bitcoin" or whatever name they came up with.  But that would mean people *choosing* to buy into the new coin, and that's not what was wanted.

Up to you how long you wait, or if you adopt segwit now.  Some wallets support it now, others don't.  You can continue to use a wallet that doesn't and grumble about it, or you can use a wallet that does, and take advantage of it.

If you use your own node, you are validating blocks for yourself, instead of relying on a trusted party to do it for you.  An advantage of this is that you get to be part of the consensus decision on protocol changes - instead of letting someone else make the decision for you.

It's completely a matter for the S2Xers to decide whether or not to go ahead.  I'm sure they will.
I think that Garzik originally said that it wouldn't be worth going ahead without 80%, but others think that refers to 80% approval at the original NYA meeting.  Whatever, though, the more that this number falls, the better an indication it is that miners are drifting away from it.
We already know that Bitcoin nodes have a majority.  We already know that the futures markets is dismissing S2X.  We already know that pretty much any indications we have from actual users (unscientific and all as these indications are) that most users don't have an appetite for this attack either.
So, all in all, it looks like S2X is doomed, but I don't expect them to give up without a fight - spamming the mempool, mining unprofitably on the S2X or BCH chains, mining empty blocks on Bitcoin - but it doesn't look to me like S2X gonna win.

Ok, so let's accept that your point about energy consumption is the sound of one hand clapping.  You don't have the other side of the comparison, you have no interest in finding it out, and you have simply ignored your errors in the projections you are making on the one side of the comparison that you actually have.
Let's call it  a"gut feel".  You don't "feel" that Bitcoin is sustainable.
In that case, feel free to look at any of the other coins.  You might be more interested in LiteCoin or VertCoin.  Or maybe something that abandons Proof of Work entirely in favour of Proof of Stake, like Peercoin.
Make whatever decision you feel is right for you.  It's just that you'll need to do more work if you want to convince anyone else.

Oh well. Those are the facts. And at least you were handed them.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:19:03
Who knows?  Anyone can activate it at any time.  
The big players have backed off from it.  Miner support is way down from any sort of critical mass.  Node support is practically non-existant
Even if someone does activate it, you might not be able to access it - if you don't have an S2X wallet, if your transfer to an exchange doesn't work because the exchange doesn't support it or no miner will process the transaction.
And if it all does work, you might end up sending your Bitcoin to whoever you send your S2X to.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:16:18

Segwit2X was cancelled by most proponents.  A single company decided to carry on with it, but a couple of days later, it cancelled as well.  So this hard fork went nowhere.

I don't recommend.
What I will be doing is sitting it out, until this blows over.  I have one regular subscription I pay with Bitcoin.  I've prepaid that for 2 months.  Pretty much everything else will be sitting in paper.
That approach will be far too conservative for some, and could see me pass some potential gains.  But I'm willing to accept that while trading is as risky as expected.

So?  Satoshi is only human(s) and as prone to errors in judgement as anyone else.
Luckily for you, Bitcoin Cash is a thing.  If you believe that indefinitely increasing blocksize is the only halal/kosher/(whatever you call suspicion of anything that Satoshi didn't say) way to scale a Satoshi-inspired currency, you have a coin right there waiting for you.  Even better, with current transaction levels on that coin, you have a long time to wait to discover if you were right or not.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:49:46
The transaction fees are paid to the miner.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:55:08
yeah, the combined rate has gone down.  Can't speculate on that.  Some miners ain't mining either coin.
But 10 Exahash/s or so figure for BTC looks to be pretty much in the middle of the history on the POW chart.
DDA will pick BCH rate up off the floor where the last difficulty adjustment put it.  But not up to the levels that generate 40/50 blocks an hour, cutting BTC to 45-55% of overall rate.
 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:10:05
Perhaps.  But when the past day's average is so much lower than the past week's average, it *suggests* that miner support is dropping.

S2X is DOA, but the lack of replay protection means it would be risky to try scraping it off my shoe too soon. I will dump it as soon as it's safe to do so.
Meantime, the inflow of new money will continue, even as alts take back the cash Bitcoin borrowed from them
There will be some turmoil in the runup to and immediate aftermath of the fork. I'm happy to ride that out.

S2X will launch at a much lower value than Bitcoin, but the same difficulty. Effort spent mining S2X will be less profitable than the same effort spent mining Bitcoin.
Only the most aggressively anti-Bitcoin miners will eat that loss for any appreciable time. No2X and neutral miners will mine Bitcoin.

In this case, the users decided.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:43:40
If both coins survive, then it's possible that x% of the pre-fork value will go to one coin and (100-x)% will go to the other.  The value of x is unknown, but the futures market gives some indication.
Outside of that, it may be that the value of one or both of the coins falls as money flows back into alts.
On the other hand, maybe there's money out there waiting until the fork crap is all over before coming back, which could raise the value of one or both coins.
Short answer:  Not necessarily, but maybe.

You misunderstand the significance of signalling, and you also seem to be under the impression that Bitcoin.com is a neutral player rather than a vehicle owned by Roger Ver, a key pusher of both Bitcoin Cash and Segwit2X.
Denying the miners in his pool the option to decide what chain is consistent with his desire to control.
Still, the man who shilled for MtGox, isn't exactly known for his shrewd judgement.
All this means is that miners who would rather mine Bitcoin will simply move to a less controlling pool. Ver is running out of feet to shoot himself in.

I can't speak for everyone's motivations, but it was important you got that 'core devs' chip off your shoulder.

There is a much better solution coming. I'm happy to wait.

Innovation is continuing in Bitcoin. There's a new Release candidate of Core available. Work is underway on Lightning, which is a really transformative leap forward.

The S2X fork had a part time developer, was built on old code which did not have bug fixes and was proposed to be launched in a way that would have put user's funds at risk of misappropriation.
If you think slow transactions are bad news for Bitcoin, imagine if the sub was full of users saying 'I sold my S2X and my Bitcoins are gone too. Where's my money gone??'
Keeping the community together is a silly line to take. When a few dozen self appointed Bitcoin grandees went into a room and came out telling us what they were going to do to the coin, *that's* when the split was born. It wasn't our responsibility to say 'Yes boss'.

Imagine your money is a bag of reversi playing pieces - two tone discs, white on one side, black on the other.
Changing your money from fiat to Bitcoin or back to fiat is as easy as flipping a reversi piece. Black side up, it's a Bitcoin. White side up, it's fiat.
Let's say the value of piece is the same as a cappucino. You want a coffee, you hand over a reversi piece. It doesn't matter which way up it is, it's still worth one coffee.
If you assume that Bitcoin increases in value, then we can say that for every x black side up reversi you have, you get y new ones, also black side up.
So the more black side up reversi you have at any point, the faster your overall wealth increases... and you can still get your coffee.
TLDR... Dollars are depreciating and can be exchanged for stuff, Bitcoin are appreciating in value and can be exchanged for stuff... why do you need dollars?

I'm not hugely sure what an Arizona tea is, but for the purposes of this answer, I'm going to assume it's a cup or mug of a delicious hot beverage, costing somewhere less than 5 bucks.
When I walk through the story of the teadrinker here, I get a little underwhelmed. 
Eddie gets paid in dollars.  The Fabulous Tea Shop does business in dollars.  Ever with an eye to a new market, they have installed a point of sale dohickey from BitPay or some similar outfit.  The dohickey comes with a half-dozen "Bitcoin Accepted Here" stickers, but The Fabulous Tea Shop never touches Bitcoin, the dohickey puts dollars in their account.
Eddie likes Bitcoin.  Every payday, he takes some of his dollars and buys some Bitcoin.  Every morning he uses the Point of Sale dohickey at his favourite tea shop to to convert a small portion of his Bitcoin to dollars to pay for his cup of Arizona Tea.
Netting it out, all that has happened is that Eddie has paid some fees to see some of his money as Bitcoin, and later paid some more fees so that the Fabulous Tea Shop can see it as dollars again.  Aside from the fact that Eddie's money may have grown a little in its Bitcoin state, there's no real benefit to anyone except the people taking the fees.
If there's no real benefit, it ought not to be a high priority.
If Eddie was actually getting paid in Bitcoin, or if the Fabulous Tea Shop was actually running Bitcoin accounts and doing business in Bitcoin, then it would be a whole different story.  But in the vast, vast majority of cases that's not what's happening.
A cheaper solution for Eddie would be to have a special pocket in his tatty old wallet, or even just a special pocket in his pants if he's not a wallet kind of guy. 
Call that his Bitcoin pocket and put $100 in there on payday.  While it's in that pocket, he calls it his Bitcoins.  So far, no fees paid.  At the coffee shop, he just takes a $20 out and hands it over at the counter, and puts the change back in his Bitcoin pocket.  Instant settlement, no fees.  Sure, his "Bitcoin" won't appreciate in value, but then again, if Bitcoin is having a bear day, they won't get dragged down either.  And, if he has anything left in his Bitcoin pocket when the next payday comes around, he can buy actual Bitcoin with whatever's left over.
Don't get me wrong.  I'm bullish on Bitcoin.  I think it can deliver on tons of use cases, with many more to come.  I just don't think that this is the one we should be focused on as a priority.

As have I, but it's kind of frustrating when you choose to converse in a one-directional manner.  By that I mean that I take the time to review your advice to take a year's worth of living expenses and put them into a non (or less) appreciating asset, rather than leaving them appreciate for as long as possible before paying for your expenses, you don't take the time to discuss my replies.  You just shift to dismissing your advice as mere hypotheticals.  When you chose neither to defend your advice or accept that it may have been ill conceived, then the conversation becomes somewhat pointless - no matter how helpful and patient I try to be.
Your new points today about how/when Bitcoin adoption will increase are interesting, but a wholly different topic.

Your reply today shifts to a new topic, around how/when Bitcoin adoption will increase.  While that is a fascinating topic, it's not one I'm going to try to discuss with you, as experience tells me I'll be somewhat wasting my time.
As I've said repeatedly.  It's your money, you decide your strategy.  Best of luck with it.

It's not the core team. Bitcoin is ready. There are multiple project teams building second layer solutions. They won't be launched until they're ready.

The faucet operator bought or mined the coins that they pay out. Usually the payout is in teenytiny fractions, and you have to build up a load of payouts to reach the minimum withdrawal.

It would require a change to the Proof of Work algorithm. This was the driver behind recent fork Bitcoin Gold, although some are concerned with the premining of that one.

None of which excuses facilitating the misappropriation of user funds.  Especially if you're doing this in an effort to control a $120 billion+ financial system.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:17:10
In the unlikely event that there was a secret ninja team of S2X miners and nodes about to mass deploy on the network, then S2X would be viable (albeit without community support) and people's coins would be at risk of misappropriation due to replay attacks.
Chances are, it will be absolultely nothing, or some symbolic move by a disrguntled actor, which will die off without support.
But there may be people sitting n S2X futures desperate enough to sell them, so the responsible thing for exchanges to do is to monitor the situation with a view to protecting user funds.

@_date: 2017-11-07 20:53:49
Interesting, you're not buying the idea that a Bitcoin implementation of a solution which reduces a revenue stream for miners might be a concern for miners.  If you're not recognising profit as a motive, I'm not sure where we can go with this.


That depends.  It could be to developers of second-tier solutions, operators of them, participants in them.  It's early days yet, but there are a mix of open source and for-profit companies looking to develop solutions in this space.


Ahhh, it's always a pleasure to welcome our BTC brethern.  Blockstream is one company building a solution in this space, but there's no need for people to use their solution over any of the others.  And, for bonus points, the Blockstream patents are available under the [Defensive Patent License](

@_date: 2017-11-07 11:49:42
People need to worry.  It is probably the biggest threat from S2X, that people's funds can be misappropriated because of lack of replay protection.  It's been highlighted here and elsewhere a gazillion times.
Trying to scrape S2X coins off your Bitcoins is somewhere between impossible and (difficult, risky and unreliable).
If you can hodl and wait, time is on your side, but if you try to move any coins (either coin) after the split, then you could find yourself with unintended consequences.
This lack of replay protection is not an accident, it's a feature.  With replay protection, S2X would join the market as a new coin, and would have to try to convince people that it was worth adopting.  Without replay protection, S2X seeks to redefine "Bitcoin", replacing the current one under the same name.
That's why $120 billion of user funds are being put at risk, because S2X wants the name Bitcoin instead of calling their fork something else.

Just a word of caution on this, the byteball drops are now really small.
For every 1 BTC, you get .00625 GB.  GB's are currently trading at about $216.  So, for each 1 BTC, you get about $1.35 worth of an alt.

Nice case, well put.  Maybe you could help shed more light for anyone interested


What's a decent option for someone on a modest budget.  Something that will actually make a difference, and hopefully a return for long enough to cover costs, but without requiring a big up front commitment?  Ideally, something that isn't Bitmain, but I think your last paragraph might rule that out.


Can you elaborate on this a little?
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:57:32
It's not 'Bitcoin' asking for those details, it is government regulation, and it is required because the exchanges process your cash.

As I say, if you're not confident with the direction, community or motivation of Bitcoin - then you should invest somewhere you have more confidence.
I don't want to sound dismissive though.  If you are committed to Bitcoin, but would like more involvement, then there are [Developer Communities]( you can reach out to.

For *mining* cumulative hash power actively drives the *creation* of blocks, ensuring that new blocks are being added to the chain faster than a rogue attacking miner can rewrite existing ones.
*Validation* is a much less CPU-intensive process, observable from the fact that a node can run on a pi.  It doesn't really matter what how much spare CPU a node has, once it has decided whether or not to validate a block, it has nothing much to do until the next block comes along.
It may be that Satoshi never considered that an active node on the network might decide not to mine, but non-mining nodes exist.  Cumulative CPU power (or hashrate) only governs the creation of blocks, not the validation of them, as this is done indpependently by each node.  The only "vote" is whether or not a node accepts a block.  With validation, there is no race condition where CPU power confers an advantage or authority.
When it comes to the mining hashrate, it will be interesting to see how that evolves over time.  How many miners will remain committed to S2X.

I think it makes sense to get paid in the currency that matches your most important outgoings. Got a dollar denominated mortgage? Then you probably are better off being paid in dollars so that you don't take on the exchange risk.
Then again, this may depend on other circumstances. If you have a no-recourse mortgage and no family dependants, maybe it's easy to walk out on a mortgage you can no longer afford.

It's an attack because it offers no replay protection.  Any transaction you make on one chain can be replayed on the other.  Want to send your S2X to conversion service.  Fine, but you're sending your Bitcoins there too.  If you're lucky, you might get them back.  If not, sucks to be you.
It's an attack because it seeks to force a change on a community that, so far as we can tell, don't want it.  In that sense, it seeks to move control of Bitcoin's future from users to a self-selected group who want to own any future changes.  
It's an attack because much of that group is controlled by a single company which runs a mining pool, has a major stake in other companies that run mining pools, and manufacturers mining equipment.  Giving them control of the direction of Bitcoin itself is more than a mere conflict of interest, it is an attack on Bitcoin.
It is an attack because it seeks to drive [the wrong solution]( to scaling.
It is an attack on Bitcoin because it excluded the current development team from the strategy team and is putting into the hands of someone already working on yet another solution hostile to Bitcoin.
It is an attack because it is using covert methods to try to gain a foothold post-fork, denying users to exercise freedom of choice.
It is an attack because its proponents [make it clear that it is an attack](

Any guy who spent $20, or whatever the equivalent was, on pizza also lost millions of dollars by not buying bitcoin with the money.
That's the point.
 Cryptocurrencies and fiat are different ways of denominating the same thing - your liquid assets, or cash.  When you can convert so quickly and easily between them, it makes little sense to regard them as different assets. 
If you believe that Bitcoin is definitely going to appreciate a lot over the next year, why would you convert next October's rent money from Bitcoin to Litecoin *today* when you could just leave it in Bitcoin until you actually have to spend it? Why deny yourself 11 months of growth on the Bitcoin rate?

There is no replay protection.  It's unclear if there are any miners.  There are next to no nodes.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:24:45
S2X seeks to become Bitcoin. Instead of launching as a new improved coin, on 'improved' Bitcoin code, it is being launched as an attack on Bitcoin.
The lack of replay protection shows that they care nothing for the $120 billion of user funds invested in Bitcoin.
The fact that the part time S2X developer can't be bothered copy pasting bug fixes from the Core code into the S2X code shows that they care nothing for protecting even S2X users.
The only thing they care about is control over the direction of Bitcoin and ownership of the BTC symbol.
'They' isn't even all the few signatories of the NYA, some of whom have already walked away from S2X, but a singleminded subset.
It's an abhorrent power grab which would see a single company, Bitmain, extend their influence from mining equipment, mining patents, and mining pools to the development of Bitcoin itself.

I don't get this. Can you elaborate, please?
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:08:33
Pure speculation, but I think it's a big part of it.  If you are a large scale miner, you've invested a fortune in your farm.  The halvening is coming.  Your business model relies on you getting a cut of more and more transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:21:51
Your logic is all wrong, but you probably don't care about that.  
As Bitcoin moves more transactions to be settled off chain, they don't need to be mined at all.  Think about that.
Even if everything stayed on chain, mining processes blocks, not transactions.  The number of transactions in a block can be increased through compression techniques (like Segwit) and through block size increases. 
On the flip side, the difficulty will increase over time, so it will cost more electricity to process each block.
In short, the math here is far more complicated than you are allowing for.
And, of course, you still have no idea what energy the banking system uses.  Remember you need to take into account not just the energy cost of processing online transactions, but also the energy cost of mining copper, zinc and whatever other metals into coins, the energy cost of producing new and ever more plasticised notes, for every currency, in every currency, and distributing all of these coins and notes to consumers and businesses, the energy costs of maintaining a branch networks, head offices, data centres for every bank in the world... there's a lot to research and add up.  If you actually care.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:06:34


It shouldn't though.  Any retailer who claims to accept Bitcoin, but really settles in dollars should make that clear to the customer at the point of purchase.  While the store provides a conversion tool for the convenience of customers, the sale is settled in dollars and any exchange risk is being borne by the Bitcoin customer and not the store.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:04:24
Wow, way cheaper than me.
I've never run those rigs, so I won't advise.  I would just ask that you consider Slushpool for your mining activity.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:20:44
Yup, that's about it. Just one tweak. The exchange never erroneously took anything. You sent them the S2X, but the same     transaction that you used to send the S2X is also a valid transaction on the BTC chain. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:47:06


@_date: 2017-11-21 19:39:36


You can't decide for other people whether they should spend or save.  As regards a more or less constant rate, there's no way to achieve that for now as Bitcoin is still so new and adoption is increasing.


This doesn't matter, in the slightest.  Bitcoin is highly divisible as is, and can be easily extended to any number of decimal places that we need.  If you want to buy a bike in 30 years, there will be a Bitcoin price for it.


(For miners).  Not sure what point you are making here.  Miners will get fees to mine.


As more transactions move off chain, the power consumed in mining a block will be divided over many more transactions.  As you say, there may be other and better ways to manage the power consumption and energy wasted.


People won't accept it, you say, but it's hard to know why that should be any different now to anything else.  Some people own lots of land.  Others don't own any.


Bitcoin is not anonymous.  All onchain transactions are recorded in a public ledger.  Governments already have legislation at their disposal to demand the id's associated with exchange addresses etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:00:25
Bitcoin is in its infancy.  The steadily increasing price is a function of supply and demand, no more.  It seems inevitable that the price will plateau once everyone who wants some has what they can afford.
Fiat currency isn't magically stable, it's heavily engineered through QE and other mechanisms where state operators manipulate supply by inventing new money whenever they need it, and controlling interest rates.  Bitcoin sidesteps this manipulation.
You think the bubble will pop?  Maybe you're right, but I don't think so.  People who talk about the dot com bubble rarely mention companies like Amazon whose stock is worth many multiples of what it was during the bubble.
That said, you do your own research.  If you don't think Bitcoin is a good investment, then steer clear of it.  It just leaves me wondering why you bothered posting this, instead of just getting on with stock portfolio.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:18:28
Just asking you to substantiate your claim.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:33:09


It wasn't just the code, although that was bad enough, it was everything else.  It was a self-selected elite, most of whom had never contributed a line of code to Bitcoin itself, making plans for Bitcoin in a closed room meeting.  It was about ousting the existing development team.  It was about Bitmain - a near monopoly manufacturer of mining equipment, with a direct ownership of one major pool, and a stake in the companies operating a number of others, growing its influence on the decision making of Bitcoin itself.  It was about telling us that miner hashrate was how the system decided rules, and that nodes didn't matter.  It was about a takeover of the Bitcoin brand.  And most unconscionable of all, it was about putting $120 billion of user funds at risk of misappropriation  .But to listen to the proponents it was just about scaling.  That's the trojan horse.
To come back to the code.  It wasn't exactly brilliant.  It was built on an old version of the core code.  When a later release of core came out with some bugfixes, the S2X team didn't even bother porting those fixes onto their branch.  A half-hearted attempt at something they could conceivably pretend was at least a nod towards replay protection was abandoned after it was found to be flawed.  Github was a ghost town.


That's exactly what it was. 


Those decisions are being made all the time.  Not everyone agrees with them, but again, off-chain transactions are best for the future of Bitcoin.  Scaling through block sizes isn't.  The problem, if there is one, is that good solutions can take longer than bad, simple ones.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:43:15
I control neither the spam nor the development, so I can't tell you the future of either.
What I will tell you though is that it's not achieving its goal.  The spam attacks are hurting real users, but I don't believe that's the aim.  The aim is to salvage Bitcoin Cash, and it doesn't seem to be working.  It's still just pump and dump.

Fair point, but every increase in blockchain size is a move to some ~~de~~centralisation.  (Edit)
Speaking personally, I don't think the "coffee shop purchase" is the killer use we need to be pursuing right now.  There are other coins for that, but to be absolutely frank, none of them is as good as cash for all concerned.
I get paid in fiat.  My coffee guy does his accounts in fiat.  It adds no real benefit to anyone if I convert my fiat to crypto (of any hue) for a while, before converting it back to fiat for the coffee guy.  Sure, the couple of bucks worth of bitcoin might accumulate a few cents in value, while I leave it crypto, but it might also lose some fiat value.
By getting level 2 in place, we take Bitcoin to where it can do all of that, AND do micropayments, smart contracts and all sorts of stuff that is still sucky everywhere.  For me, the dream is not to replace cash everywhere that cash is now, it's to deliver where cash the banking system can't deliver now.  If in the course of that, we also replace cash, that's cool too.
I don't know if that's how "core" thinks.  I never talk to them.  It's just how I think.  I buy my coffee with cash and my VPN with Bitcoin.  Maybe someday I'll buy my coffee with Bitcoin too (or Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash) but I don't feel the need to, and I don't get paid in Bitcoin.
I understand that there is another perspective and there are other coins for that.  I don't think we're ever going to converge on a single coin that is better than all the others at everything.  There will always be niches and specialties.

@_date: 2017-11-10 22:28:05
Two different questions.
What happens to your coins when you die comes down to the preparations you made.  Have you planned a way that your family can inherit your coins?
As more bitcoins become lost, the others become more valuable.  Not true some technical method, just through supply and demand.  Lost coins are not available for purchase.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:28:07
If you mean what are the barriers to entry for an individual starting to mine, the main one is cost.
Mining rigs cost a few thousand dollars to buy, and the electricity costs can be high.  Also depending on the number of rigs you use, there can be additional issues with the heat generated, the fan noise, and maintenance.
Another difficulty is the near monopoly that Bitmain has on the manufacture of mining rigs.
There are some miners on here, but you might get more at If you are willing to get into mining, not to make a profit on the mining, but to contribute to some decentralisation, there are other options like USB ASIC's, which will probably never make a profit, but will add (just a tiny bit each) to the hash power available to Bitcoin.

Unless you actively try to scrape S2X off Bitcoin (and the method for Bitcoin Cash is NOT going to work) then they both travel together.

Paper wallet cold storage. :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:25:16


You haven't linked to it, so I am guessing you mean [this one](  Is that the right one?
If so, you seem to focus a lot on storage.  Which isn't an issue I have mentioned.
Andreas Antonoploous describes the issue more elequently than I can in his video [Delivering Liberty at Scale]( but I'll try to look at just one point.
A node gets 10 minutes to download and validate a block. That places limits on how big a block can be. If you wanted 10 times as many people, each doing 10 times as many transactions, with each confirming on average 10 times faster than now, you're going from 1 meg blocks to 1 gig blocks. And you're still nowhere close to where we all want to be, which would require a few more orders of magnitude... and even then you're waiting up to 10 mins for confirmation.
Bear in mind that this is really, really modest growth.  Hardly anybody is using Bitcoin for transacting, and most of those who do don't exactly use it every day.  So 10 times as many people doing 10 times as many transactions is not exactly going to threaten Visa.  For real mainstream adoption, you're going to need another few orders of magnitude.  Maybe a 100 GB block, to be downloaded and validated in 10 minutes.  If you want to add in brand new stuff that visa or cash can't do, like micro (or even smaller) transactions, then you're adding another couple of zeroes.  And that so that you can pay some dust to access some paywall content, which you might be able to access in ten 10 minutes after your transaction is mined, and confirmed.
At that sort of scale, running a full node is getting out of the reach of most users, and becoming a centralised service offered by specialist providers.  Node validation becomes something you trust someone else to do.  You get to strike a line through the trustless nature of p2p payments.  And as a user, you lose any say in any future changes, as the node providers you trust will decide for you what the rules are.
And all of that is just looking at the decentralisation failure of the Big Block solution.  I haven't even looked at how the rest of the network, other than nodes, would deal with those massive blocks.  But I suspect that there would be some other low tunnels along the way.
(I say 1 meg blocks now.  We know that with segwit, the existing block size can process more transaction data than that in a block, but you get the idea.)
On the other hand, off chain transactions deliver a much better scaling solution where transactions can process in seconds.  Much better for buying a coffee, accessing a paywalled article, or umpteen other use cases that will come to light in the future.
I won't even get into mining, because that's bigger than Bitcoin.  It's shocking how little competition there is for mining hardware.

@_date: 2017-11-12 01:19:04
You've got 10 minutes to download and validate a block. That places limits on how big a block can be. Bear in mind that practically no one is using Bitcoin for much yet. If you wanted relatively modest growth of 10 times as many people, each doing 10 times as many transactions, with each confirming on average 10 times faster than now, you're going from 1 meg blocks to 1 gig blocks. And you're still nowhere close to where we all want to be, which would require a few more orders of magnitude... and even then you're waiting up to 10 mins for confirmation.
Offchain transactions are far more scalable. They are the answer. Throwing in a hard fork and protocol change now just gets in the way of the real solution.

If a coin gets lost, it's lost.  Poof.  Gone.  


Nothing.  If the demand for Bitcoin keeps growing and the supply keeps trickling down due to lost coins, that's two forces to make each remaining coin more valuable.
You can break down a Bitcoin into whatever size fraction you need so that you can have an amount of Bitcoin that is worth, say a coffee.  That might be .0003 BTC today.  Maybe it's .00003 in 2 years time.  Maybe .00000003 in 500 years time.  If that looks like an ugly number, call it 3 satoshi.

The Bitcoin Cash fork included replay protection, so your transactions on one chain can't be replayed on another.
Possibly the simplest way to transfer is to use the coinomi wallet app.  Create a BCH wallet and import the keys.  It's got an inbuilt exchange function where you can sell your BCH for BTC using changelly or shapeshift.

If you run a full node, you validate blocks, if you don't you trust someone else to do it for you. In the event of a hard fork, you node runners can decide which side they are on. Others let their service providers choose.

An open source code base and distributed transaction validation are kind of critical. That way if some bad actor developer attempts to subvert the code, there are opportunities to discover and reject the code. And even if the entire development team conspires, users can just refuse to run the new code and continue to apply existing validation rules.

Hmm, you directed me here from a previous thread about block size and decentralisation, but I don't see that this particularly addresses that topic, but I may as well reply to what I see here.


You seem to be confusing "at an unspecified date" and "never".  Bitcoin will have lightning and, more generally, other off chain solutions.  These will throw things wide open in terms of scalability, micro transactions etc.  There is no way that 10 minute ASIC mining can get there, especially as we approach another halvening.


I'm not sure what you mean by dropping the "concept of cash".  I'm not aware of the concept, but if you mean that Bitcoin Cash is going to follow the lead of the Bitcoin.com site and try to use the name "Bitcoin", then that's certainly not going to be supported by exchanges, or a majority of wallet or merchant services providers I would suggest, and can only serve to try to win users by deceit and misdirection when it is failing to win them by any other means.
I don't even think that Bitcoin Cash needs do that.  It's pretty clear that Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin have different immediate priorities.  Bitcoin Cash seems to be focusing on fast cheap transactions now, and will have to address scaling later; while Bitcoin seems to be  focusing on scaling now, and will deliver fast cheap transactions on top of that.
Customers have a clear choice on which one they want to use today, or they could use any of a range of other payment options at their disposal, whether crypto or traditional.

If I understand you right, the assumption is that no matter how the coins are dispersed today, the top 1% will buy them when they want them.
I guess that could be true of anything in simple economic theory, but in practice it may not work out.
How many people make up the top 1% in the US?  Maybe 3 million people (based on a population somewhere over 300 million)? 
What's the maximum number of Bitcoins in existence which are not  already lost?  This is a harder number to work out, but a wild guess would say it's about 12 million.  
For every one of the top 1% in the US to own just one coin, they would need 25% of all the Bitcoins that exist and are not lost.
That's a pretty tall order, given that they would be competing against the very richest individuals from all over the world, as well as pension funds and other financial instruments.  Just how far would they be willing to chase the price before they decide it's not worth it?  A million dollars per coin?  A billion?
If they're throwing dollars away at that rate, what will that do to the value of the dollar, and the rest of their dollar-denominated wealth?
You could have made precisely the same point in 2013.  Who's going to hang onto their 100 Bitcoins, when a Bitcoin is worth $1,000?  Will they really want to risk that $100,000 falling to zero?  Or will they get out now?
Some of them did, and what happened was that those coins got spread over a wider community than those who got into the coin in the first few years.  Sure, they didn't have to sell all 100 coins, just as someone now with one coin doesn't have to sell all 1,000 mBTC.

@_date: 2017-11-10 11:24:47
Using the method I suggest, you don't store a written copy of the passphrase anywhere. You store a number of encoded strings in different secure locations. No one of these can be used to recreate the passphrase. You need to have, say, any 4 out of 7 of them (or whatever numbers you choose when you set it up) to retreive the passphrase, or whatever it is you have encoded. In this way, you are not exposed if one of your safe locations gets compromised, and if one of them gets destroyed, you haven't lost your secret.
But it's just a suggested option. If you have another method that can ensure you never forget your passphrase and that your family can use to access your coins in the event of your unexpected death... good for you. Use whatever works.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:50:57
Why blame just one side for the split in the community?  But those of us who came together to defeat S2X showed that Bitcoin is a ground up movement, it is not controlled by self-selected management group.  That's a crucial message for a distributed platform like Bitcoin, and has strengthened Bitcoin for the future.  "Just shut up and do what you're told", might be a way to enforce unity, but it's not the best.
Wu was already backing Bitcoin Cash.  He's only been accepting Bitcoin Cash for payment for his mining gear for some time now.  Why wouldn't he back it.  With its BigBlock, mine every transaction, it's really good news for him.
Wu's Bitmain not only makes mining gear, it also operates a major pool, and has a stake in other companies that operate other mining pools.  Why on earth would any sane person want to give him further vertical integration by letting him influence the development of Bitcoin itself.
Bitmain backed BCH all the way.  But when it became clear that "look, we have Big Blocks" was not winning people over to his new coin, he tried to double up and seize control of Bitcoin itself.  He had his ass handed to him.  So let him focus on trying to pump Bitcoin Cash again, along with Ver.  It's never going to compete with Bitcoin and the multi tiered solution that will take transactions away from miners, giving users near-instant transactions.
So, yeah, I'm still here.  I'm still bullish.  If you're not, you may want to look elsewhere.  Bitcoin Gold goes live tomorrow.  It's using Equihash, so Wu's miners can't touch it.

It depends on the stage of adoption.
Let's say you're a guy who runs a store.  You buy stuff.  You pay costs to run your store.  You sell stuff.  Hopefully, out of that you make a salary.  From your salary you pay rent/mortgage on someplace to live, you pay your bills, insurance and stuff.  And maybe you buy the occasional beer or pizza.
If you pay for everything in dollars, then setting the Bitcoin price may just be a matter of accepting dollars at the current exchange rate for Bitcoin.  The Bitcoin exchange rate is instantaneous.  But your customer is ultimately paying you in dollars, and they need to know that.  So, if they paid you .01 BTC for a $77 item, and they return it tomorrow, they will get $77 or $77 worth of Bitcoin at tomorrow's rate.  Which may be more or less than .01 BTC, but you're not taking that risk, your customer is.
If you pay for everything in Bitcoin - cost of goods, cost of running your store, cost of living - then the opposite is true.  It's a lot more predictable for you if you sell your stuff for Bitcoin, but maybe have some conversion dohickey for people who want to pay with pictures of dead presidents.
In reality most places are in the former situation, paying for everything in dollars.  But, some of them do accept Bitcoin rather than converting to dollars.
The bigger and more comprehensive the Bitcoin economy grows, the more we might move towards the second scenario above, where more of the costs are in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:10:28
We share a pool of miners with another coin who use the same Proof Of Work.  Miners (some, not all) [swap between them]( depending on profitability on any given time.
When the other coin is more profitable to mine, that's where you'll find the miners, and things start to slow down on the Bitcoin chain.
At that point, Bitcoin is somewhat vulnerable to spam transactions which pile work onto the backlog.  We're getting through it, but just for context, this past weekend was [not the worst experience of this]( that we've had.
The biggest this year coincided (by pure chance, I am sure) in the run up to the launch of the other coin, when there was a need to create a reason for that other coin.  There was then a lesser occurrence (again, by pure chance, I am sure) when that other coin launched.  And now, this one, which just happens ()by pure chance, I am sure) to follow the announcement that yet another fork has been cancelled.
If they deliver what it says on the tin, upcoming changes to the other coin should stabilise it at 6 blocks per hour instead of its current wild oscillations.  That should make things less crazy for both chains.
In addition, moving a lot of transactions off chain will remove the need for miners to process those transactions, and should allow bitcoin transactions to continue even if we have a mining issue for whatever reason.

To protect users from the chaos they are otherwise about to create, and to protect user funds.  There will be users caught out when they try to send one of these coins to another party and they lose the other coin as well.
I get that this is all secondary to the priorities of the forkers, but that's part of the problem.  When you seek to control the financial system that holds $120 billion dollars of user funds, your first priority ought to be not to risk those funds.
No matter how much you really, really, really would prefer your new coin to be called "bitcoin", it is just not a justification for all the users who will lose coins as a result of this.

@_date: 2017-11-06 18:57:30
I've no doubt that many people intend to, and I wouldn't dispute your numbers, but with both coins glued together anyone who trades BTC or S2X for their favourite alt, may find that they have lost the other one.  So if they just got on the Bitcoin bus for the "free coins", they could have made a very expensive mistake.
On the other hand, if they just wanted to buy into the bull train, it might work out ok for them.

One the one hand, there's the supply, and on the other, there's the demand.
Ultimately the supply is finite, although it's currently growing slowly towards that final limit.

For hodling, I don't worry about short term ups and downs, because I strongly believe that over the term of my holding, it's going nowhere but way up.  And if I'm wrong, well, it's money I can walk away from.
For spendling, I don't worry because I don't have big gaps between spending and refilling, so no matter whether it's going up or down, I get in and out at as close enough to the same price that it doesn't bother me.

You are wrong on so many levels. It's quite funny.  Let me try to help you, just on the off chance that you aren't blindly FUDing.
The new Difficulty Adjustment in BCH is set to stabilise BCH at 6 blocks per hour.  That's instead of the wild fluctuations from 0 blocks / hour to 50 blocks / per hour that EDA delivered. 
With just 6 blocks being discovered every hour, that's not a lot of payment for all those miners.  It's certainly no reward for all their investment, and isn't going to cover their running costs.  So what are the possible outcomes?
All those unpaid miners might continue competing with each other for the 6 blocks per hour, most of them losing and burning resources for nothing.
Or they might cut their costs by shutting down their mines.  If they're not getting paid, why leave those expensive rigs running?  Who knows,they might even sell their rigs on the aftermarket, where they would be snapped up be people looking to mine core.
Or they might try to use their expensive mining equiment to make money, in which case they will mine Bitcoin.  Just like [they are doing today](
All that BCH is changing is that it is no longer going to pay miners to mine one near-empty block per minute.  That was damaging to both coins.  When they are not paid by BCH, they will mine Bitcoin, for which they will be substantially paid.
The stability in BCH, will also stabilise Bitcoin, ensuring that it doesn't get starved of miners by temporary mining frenzies in BCH.
No occasional starvation, means no transaction time spikes, means no spikes in fees to beat the transaction times.  
Pretty much everything you've said is ass backwards.

If you hold Bitcoin in a wallet you control at the time of the fork, you will also hold the same number of S2X.  As always, the value of 1 BTC before the fork may be more than, less than, or the same as the total value of post-fork BTC + S2X.
There is a difference this time, though.  The S2X proponents have not  implemented replay protection.  That's sort of like sticking the S2X onto your Bitcoin.  Move either coin to another address, and you could very well move the other one too.
Let's say that you decide to sell your S2X immediately after the fork, and buy Bitcoin, or Litecoin, or Ethereum or whatever.  The exchange service will give you an address on the S2X chain that you can send your coins to.  They give you your other coin, and you're happy.  But you may also discover that your Bitcoin has gone to the same address on the Bitcoin chain.  Your Bitcoins are gone.  Now you have to contact support at the exchange service and say "May I have my Bitcoin back?".  All going well, they will send them back to you as soon as they can process the support request.  You're down a few transaction fees and you've been locked out of your coins for a while.
But what if the exchange service has already moved the S2X from the address they gave you to the address of a customer of theirs who wanted to buy S2X?  Your precious Bitcoin may already have been moved to that guy along with the S2X.  Good luck getting it back from there.

By default, this is correct.  If you send B2X to some address, the same instruction is just as valid on the Bitcoin chain, and so your Bitcoins could travel to the same address.  
If you send your B2X to someone else's address, you could end up sending them your Bitcoins as well.
There are some techniques suggested to avoid this, but it's not as simple as it would be if replay protection was implemented.

Bullocks are castrated bulls. Bollocks are testicles, but the word is also used to refer to what might also be called 'nonsense'.  In that context, the spellings 'bollox' and 'bollix' are frequently used.

Money moved into Bitcoin from alts as people hoped for an airdrop of a "free coin".  They would then sell that coin and their Bitcoin to go back to their alts.
When  S2X was called off, and the prospect of "free coins" disappeared, that money went back to the alts.  The drop in price spooked others causing more downward pressure.
Bitcoin is still up more than 15% on where it was a month ago (which was then an all time high), so there might be a bit more downside.  As the runup to and pull back from the fork non-event unwind, things will return back to whatever is normal for Bitcoin.
Tomorrow is the day when Bitcoin Gold launches.  Will there be a flood of people selling this new coin to buy Bitcoin?  We'll see.

You're still confusing bullocks and bollocks/bollox/bollix.. but that's not really important.
Your phraseology certainly implied that 'Satoshi' was a title *currently* held by CSW, which is why I picked up on it. 
CSW has claimed that he was Satoshi or part of Satoshi or something, but I think the claim isn't widely believed.  You might believe him, but he certainly hasn't *proved* it by, for example, signing a message with a key of Satoshi's.

You don't open a channel to each retailer, you open one to someone already on the network.
Your payment to the retailer then bounces through a number of channels until it reaches the retailer. Much like how regular internet traffic works.
Your one channel can then be used to pay any site on the network.
In action, you just copy/scan the retailer's address into your wallet and hit send. The payment should be routed to your retailer and processed in seconds.
You can already try it out on testnet.

There are multiple advantages. Speed, cost, privacy and decentralised resiliency.
Because there's no waiting for a block, transactions can complete in seconds. Instead of bidding for a place in a block, there could be multiple routes to the address you want to pay and you can potentially choose fastest, cheapest etc.

So less controversial approaches would have been to 
1.  Fork a new alt with bigger blocks and replay protection off of Bitcoin, and everyone who has been screaming for bigger blocks would have their new coin - live and let live.
2.  Fork a new alt with segwit and replay protection off of Bitcoin Cash, , and everyone who has been screaming for bigger blocks would have their new coin - live and let live.
The current strategy is far more about taking control of Bitcoin than it is about the merits of any technical change.  And, in my humble opinion, people who are prepared to screw over users to take control of a global financial system are probably not the people you want in control of that financial system.

I can't speak for them, but the point is that so long as you and whoever you want to pay are taking advantage of lightning, then it doesn't matter what the exchanges do.  Unless you use the exchanges as your wallet, and that's not generally a good thing to do.
Lighting is probably not the best way to try to send 10 BTC to/from an exchange, so that transaction will probably stay onchain anyway.

Just to try and look at the simplest case.
Let's assume that Satoshi used the same IP address everytime.
Let's assume that this was not the IP address of a VPN.
Let's assume it wasn't a shared IP - eg work, college, someone's insecure wifi, or public wifi.
Let's just assume it was a regular ISP assigned address with Satoshi's billing details associated.
Github won't have access to the customer records of the ISP.
An ISP won't reveal the identity of the person to whom that IP address was assigned at that time without some sort of a warrant.
And even with a warrant, there's no guarantee that the ISP still has those records from almost 10 years ago.

Bcash had replay protection which is required for the method you describe.  If you move your BTC to a new address, the S2X will/may just move to that address too.  
Trying to scrape the S2X off your Bitcoins is harder, and may take a number of goes before it works.  Here's a guide for the [electrum wallet](

The road and the car are different.
The current single-lane road is the blockchain.  Cars (transactions) can travel along it, but it can get crowded.
The extra lanes being worked on are the off chain transaction networks.  Cars (transactions) will be able to travel along these new lanes, or the original lane (blockchain). 
As an analogy failing, I guess I could concede that the extra lanes are more like a highway, with vast numbers of lanes, and that it's easy and cheap to build more of these lanes.

The section you quote describes the protection that is in place should an attacker attempt to "modify a past block".  That's interesting and all, but it's not at all relevant.  Nobody is talking about modification of past blocks.
What we are talking about is the enforcement of consensus rules.  That is, the protection from a miner creating an invalid block.  Should a miner create a block which is not compliant with the consensus rules enforced by nodes, then that block is rejected.  the majority of nodes on the Bitcoin network are not S2X nodes and will reject S2X blocks.

Again, the key difference as i see it between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is priorities.
Bitcoin is prioritising scaling.  Segwit has been delivered, but market adoption is lagging.  And now, offchain solutions are being worked on.  That's not entirely (or even mainly) a Bitcoin Core delivery, it's something being developed in partnership with a variety of third party projects working on their own solutions.  So laying our impatience entirely at the door of Core isn't exactly fair.
Bitcoin Cash is prioritising faster/cheaper cheaper transactions now, with scaling as something to be addressed later.
There's merits in both approaches, and users are free to decide what they want to do.
It's interesting that having failed to convince a large market share of people to switch from Bitcoin Cash, and having failed to convince the community of the merits of the S2X project, that there is now a move from the decision makers of Bitcoin Cash, whoever they are, to just call themselves Bitcoin anyway.  Thanks for the heads up.


You can take that up with whoever does.  I don't care what Bitcoin Cash is called, so long as it doesn't take the name of a coin already on the market - because the only reason for doing that is to confuse users - and really, they're the people that we all ought to be looking out for.

Because it's such a shitshow, no-one really knows.
S2X is glommed onto BTC like shit on a shoe.  Where the shoe goes, so does the shit.
In the absence of replay protection, some exchanges are trying to add some at the application layer.  Some aren't some places are shutting down trades completely until it is "safe" to restart them, although they are less clear on what will make it safe.
I think that it's just about inevitable that people are going to lose coins when they can trade, and there's a lot of bogus advice out there on how to split your coins - rehashing the advice given for the BCH split, as if it was the same situation.
Really, the only way for this to work out well for users is for the thing to be called off.

It was easy 'back then' because Bitcoin was a 2 lane highway with no traffic and no competing cryptocurrencies. If you were one of the few people mining, you could ping your coins to one of the other few people who knew about it with virtually no friction.
Times have changed.
Bitcoin has a big customer base, which is still a tiny fraction of its potential. Most people using it now, have to buy it on a regulated exchange. It's got a shit ton of competitors - some playing straight and some playing crooked.
What has now proven to be Bitcoin's defining feature. It survives and thrives on every attack.
This whole space is in its infancy. And when Bitcoin transactions are being processed in near real time for transactions of all sizes, certain other coins will be outsourcing the processing of terabyte blocks to third parties so that their transaction can be processed in 10 minutes.

If the S2X proponents had the guts to launch a whole new altcoin, with replay protection, then users would have a clear choice, their funds would be protected and I would have no issue.
The reason why this was not done was that the S2X proponents value the Bitcoin brand more than the security of user funds.  That's some repugnant shit.

What power?
They have the power to maintain the blockchain by mining, which is a very processor intensive activity.  The more miners racing with each other to build the next and the next and the next block, the harder it is for a rogue miner to accelerate so far past them as to be able to rewrite blocks.
This is actually developing into something of a problem for BCH where it's getting easier and easier for someone to be able to successfully [rewrite the whole blockchain](
Other than that, miners don't have any power.

There is no public source of this information. 
Your best hopes may lie in your own history/docs from the time of the transfer.  Why would you have used this address instead of the one you should have?  You must have got that address from someplace, right?^*  Maybe you sent them a correct payment sometime, and then later reused their address by mistake?  Check through your payments history, or any emails etc from around then to see who else you sent coins to.  That might tell you who owns the address.

The rules did not have to be applied as the fork did not happen.  If BitPico go ahead on their own with their fork, consensus will drop any blocks they create.

Nope.  The decent thing would have involved a hard fork, so that people have to actively choose which coin they want.  What is being done is a mess of different infrastructure actors favouring different things.  "BTC" could potentially refer to different chains on different platforms at different times.  Users who are expecting to be able to sell their B2X coins may discover to their horror that they have also thrown in their BTC for free.

Make sure you completely understand money laundering and banking regulations in your country. 'Oh, I didn't know... ' isn't likely to be a great defence in court.
Also, how does it work in terms of price? If I send you 100 of whatever your currency is today, do I know how many BTC I will get, or do I just have to wait and see?
Also, what if you send me the coins, and then I complain to my bank that you didn't? How do you ensure I can't get my money back after you send me the coins.
I think it could be a very risky business. Maybe just register on localbitcoins?

Then after another 210000 blocks you will have generated another 25 * 210000 = 5250000 BTC for a total of 10500000 + 5250000 = 15750000 BTC
Then after another 210000 blocks you will have generated another 12.5 * 210000 = 2625000 BTC for a total of 10500000 + 5250000 + 2625000 = 18375000 BTC

Hard to sepculate on causes.  Another pool apparently dropped S2X support, and a new pool joined without signalling S2X support.  Maybe some miners have moved between pools.  Maybe some of the S2X miners are on Bitcoin Cash today.  Maybe it's just dumb chance that the non-S2X miners are finding the blocks today.
But, whatever the cause, the percentage for the past week is 82 and for the past 24 hours it's 75.  So that at least *suggests* that some miners are losing an appetite for the contentious fork.

If it's still needed after the layered platform, of course I'm open to it. 
I believe, though, that S2x was a trojan horse. Far less to do with scaling and far more to do with who owns Bitcoin. Had that not been the case, they could just have launched a new coin and taken over the world. They still  can.
It is not the miners and a few service providers,  it is the Bitcoin community who owns Bitcoin. Demonstrating that so clearly was of great importance.
I'm not in a hurry. I will wait for a real scaling solution. I've used Lightning on testnet, and it's amazing.  With multiple projects competing to bring great implementations, further advances are inevitable.
If others can't wait, and flood instead to other coins, that's understandable, and good luck to 'em.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:49:38
I'm not familiar with the wallet, and I don't have any details, and I don't know what 10% translates to in terms of sat/byte which is the usual measure of transaction fee.... so really little to go on, but if we assume that your wallet did actually send the transaction, then there are a few things I'd check first.
Look at the transaction ID on a couple of blockchain explorers.  See what they show, and see if they all show the same thing.
If the transaction is missing on some, then we can do a rebroadcast to try propagating it again.

I don't think Bitcoin is great for transactions at the moment, and I don't feel any need to convert some euro to crypto and then convert it back to euro to buy a coffee or a book or whatever.  It's just easier to carry the euro in my pocket to start with.  
For anyone who **does** want to convert their fiat to/from a crypto to spend it, there are umpteen coins that they can choose from to do it.
So personally, I don't see the need to rush into the wrong architecture now, just to solve a problem that may or may not be artificially created by parties who are strongly opposed to the direction that Bitcoin, and various other parties are headed.

Slim. S2X will be worth a modest fraction of Bitcoin, with the same difficulty. It's hard to imagine any but the most motivated of S2X-minded miners eating that loss for too long.  Neutral and No2X miners will have no need to go near it 
BCH will get a brief boost, but as the dump sets in, that will ease off too.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:24:29
Boss is right. Really accepting any crypto (or any other fiat) while everything else in the business is denominated in local fiat introduces extra expense and exchange rate risk for the business.
Pretending to accept Bitcoin, with a point of sale conversion to fiat might excite a bit of interest, but wouldn't bring in any bits to pay you.

True.  But I haven't heard from ANY mining pool that they're going ahead with it.  There was the general "we quit" announcement, then there was the "we don't" and "ok we do" from BitPico.
There won't be many (if any) miners.  Most of the nodes are going to drop the blocks.  Rekt.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:53:29
Here's a quick guide to get started - using some specific products, you may need to vary if you don't use Android.
* Download the "Eclair Wallet Testnet" app.
(Testnet here means you're not using real Bitcoin, you're on a test network)
* Open the app and swipe right to see your address.
* Use a [testnet faucet]( to transfer some test coins to your Eclair testnet wallet address.
* Swipe left (twice?) to get to the "Lightning Channels" screen.  Click the "+" button to create a new channel, use "Autoconnect".   Opening this channel is the slowest step in the process, as you have to wait for a block, and mining activity on testnet is a bit unpredictable.  Might be a time to take a walk.
* Once the channel is up and running, you are ready to roll.  Let's buy you a coffee.  Visit the [Starblocks test coffee shop]( on your PC.  Pick yourself a coffee or two and check out.  The shop will display a QR code for the transaction.
* Go to the middle screen (transaction history) in the app and click the paper plane icon on the bottom right.  Select "scan a QR code" and point your camera at the QR code
* You will see the price and coffee purchase on your app.  Click "Send Payment".  
* Watch your phone and PC screen for transaction confirmations.  Took about 1 second for me just now.
Opening the channel is the slow on-chain transaction.  Once you have your channel open and funded, transactions are blisteringly fast.

Hodling is my initial plan.  Partly I'm trying here to air the issue so that someone planning on selling S2X immediately has a bit more awareness of the issue.

It sure doesn't.  Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and any other ASIC-based currencies are somewhat beholden to a single miner manufacturer.

I don't necessarily agree with your characterisation of two coins for two functions, but I'm generally well disposed to a live and let live outlook.
What makes it harder is that some of the same players behind the other coin I suspect you are referring to are also pumping S2X which is an attack on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:22:22

First off, I'm not here to convince you of anything. If you don't like Bitcoin, don't buy Bitcoin.
That said, I think Bitcoin has a huge future ahead of it. The technology will continue to grow and mature.  Its deflationary design gives it a huge advantage over fiat currency. Fiat still has more utility for some use cases, but Bitcoin will make up ground not just on these use cases but on other use cases where fiat is weak.
There are lots of different cryptos out there, with different design principles... proof of work Vs proof of stake; transparency Vs privacy; speed Vs security; centralisation Vs decentralisation; and various others.  It's quite possible that some of these coins will carve out very successful niches for themselves.

Nodes validate blocks, according to a set of rules.  If it's not your node, you don't decide what rules to use.  That's where the self interest comes in.
Let's say a few guys met in a boardroom someplace and decided to change the rules.  They fork the code, sell their changes as an "upgrade" and so don't spin off a new replay-protected coin, but a new fork of the same coin.  Let's say you don't like the changes they want to implement.
With your own node, you can refuse to accept their blocks.  If enough other nodes do that, then the fork will go noplace and the old rules will stay in place.
If you don't run your own node, and use it, then you let someone else make those decisions for you.

Let's say you have 1 BTC on the Bitcoin chain in address A.  After the split, you will have 1 S2X on the S2X chain, also in address A.
If you sign a transaction to send your 1 (S2X) from address A to address B on the S2X chain, that same transaction is just as valid to send 1 (Bitcoin) from address A to address B on the Bitcoin chain.
To see what this means in practice.  Suppose I approach you and offer you twice the market value in cash for your S2X coin and give you my public S2X address.  We meet up, I hand over the cash, and you send me the S2X.  
I can (or it might happen of its own accord as relays talk to each other) "replay" that transaction that you signed but on the Bitcoin chain.  Now your precious Bitcoins come to my address on the Bitcoin chain.
You can scrape the B2X off your Bitcoin to put them into different addresses, but it's much more difficult than if there was replay protection.

The supply limit is very real. There can be no more than 21 million Bitcoin. The fact that you can cut a Bit coin into smaller pieces doesn't change that fact. If you have 1 BTC, you have 1/21,000,000 of the total possible number of Bitcoins.

I don't know most of the answers to those, I'm afraid.
Having played with it in testnet, I had to specify an amount of coin when I created the channel with an existing party.  So maybe that bit is wrong in my writeup, and it should be 100% funded by the channel creator.  I'll edit that in. (Done, now)
You can connect to as many peers as you like.  There may be different networks for example, and you will want to connect to each.  Perhaps public/private networks, who knows.  
Yes, the coins are locked into that channel until it expires.

You mean mining pools.  As of now these stand as follows:








And the above assessment is from Daniel Vogel at Bitso, who says:






















It's a pretty damning assessment from one of the NYA signatories.
S2X is dead.  Users don't want it.  The mining community is pretty split, and how many of them want it enough to mine it at a loss for as long as it takes to kill the Bitcoin chain remains to be seen, but I would suspect that it's not enough to achieve it any length of time.
End state is Bitcoin survives stronger than ever before.

That depends on incoming rate.

The topic is whether or not Blockstream controls Core. I have shown it doesn't. You seem dissatisfied with that answer. But you can't seem to muster up any evidence to support the conspiracy that they do.

Did you even read the comments on that thread?
DDA targets a steady 6 blocks an hour for BCH instead of having it oscillating wildly between 0 and 50 blocks per hour.
That stability is good news for everyone.  It means, for instance, that we won't see the mining feasts on BCH when 40-50% of hashrate jumps on there to mine a block every minute or so.  And if they're not jumping onto BCH, then there's good chance they'll be mining BTC.

Quite possibly.
Apparently, ViBTC have said that [they will not mine S2X "initially"](  
Slush, as far as I can tell, have [a miner vote]( which currently reads as follows (percentages refer to hash power, not miner count):
52.63% mining Bitcoin
9.11% mining S2X
16.7% chose to leave the decision up to the Pool admin
21.56% have not voted and will be allocated in line with the above percentages
So, I think the Slush pool figures may already be accounted for.

@_date: 2017-11-01 19:34:15
There's a correlation in timing, but I doubt that it's any more than coincidence.
Conventional logic would say that Bitcoin is currently holding value "borrowed" from alts as people shift into Bitcoin for their "free" S2X.  Once the fork happens, this would see that value flow back into alts, with a drop in Bitcoin.  That's not Trump's doing.
What makes this less certain is that people may start discovering the impact of no replay protection, and their exit strategy may have to be reviewed.
Then there are other rumours about China (always China), Amazon, institutional money... all of which add to the price.  Hard to see Trump having much impact on any of those.
If anything, Trump's claim that he's the reason for stock price increases should mean that he's responsible for money going into stocks instead of Bitcoin, which would serve as a downward pressure on Bitcoin's USD rate.

However big the value of a whole bitcoin gets, the cost of printing unforgeable currency in denominations that allow for the purchase of a stick of gum, or a games console, or motorbike is going to be substantial.
There's no central authority to issue these notes, so who would do it?  Your paper note would basically be an IOU.

That's gonna depend a lot on where you live, among other things.
In my part of the world, there are precious few places that "accept" Bitcoin as payment, and nowhere that actually accepts Bitcoin.
For most people who "use" their Bitcoin, it works sort of like this.  Joe gets paid in local fiat.  Joe uses some or all of that fiat to buy Bitcoin.  Joe presents a purchase at some checkout, and the store owner offers him a third-party service to allow Joe to sell enough of his Bitcoin to get the local fiat to pay the store owner.
While that might make Joe feel fun and futuristic and all, spending his magic internet money, there's nothing there by way of peer-to-peer exchange of currency.  Just Joe paying one third party to convert his fiat to Bitcoin, and another third party to convert his Bitcoin back to fiat.  And that's not exciting for me. 
I do pay for a VPN with my Bitcoin.  My ISP has a pretty good rep for not keeping logs etc... but with no banking details, they don't even know who I am.  I like that.  That's a real advantage of Bitcoin over paying with Visa.
Other than that I continue mostly to pay in fiat.  It's what I earn, it's what the stores deal in, and the transaction is instant.
Lightning will be very exciting.  For those incidental purchases it may challenge fiat, but do I intend to use Bitcoin just for the sake of using Bitcoin?  Nope.

With respect, you're not making sense.
On the one hand, you say that you shouldn't touch your Bitcoin because it's appreciating, and yet your original advice that that the best thing to do is to take a whole year's worth of expenses out of Bitcoin as soon as possible.  Remember?


I've used numbers, math, to show you the folly of this advice, and you haven't responded.
If, as per your premise, you assume that Bitcoin is appreciating, the sensible thing is NOT to take large lumps of your money out of Bitcoin as soon as possible to stop it appreciating so that you feel better about spending it.  The sensible thing to do is to leave as much of your money appreciating for as long as possible, and only take it out when you have to.
But, as I said, it's your money.  Do with it as you see fit.

Let's look at a modest target of just 10 times as many users, doing 10 times as many transactions on average, and getting confirmed on average 10 times as fast as things stand currently.
That means we're looking at blocks 1,000 times bigger than the 1 MB block size.  So 1 GB blocks.  With a new block every 10 minutes, that 6GB an hour. 
And that doesn't even allow for any time for actually validating the block.  That's just transporting it. The node still has to validate that the block follows the consensus rules.  If we imagine that a node can validate a 1 GB block in 4 minutes (bye bye Pi nodes), that means the 1 GB block needs to be transported in 6 minutes, so we're looking at 10 GB/hour, or 22 Mbps.
South Korea is the [only country in the world]( where average internet connection speeds exceed that number.
And that's with very modest targets.  If you want to have visa-level transactions per hour, if you want to enable things that visa can't currently handle, like micro payments, or who knows what we will think of in the future, then you're going to look at hundreds or thousands of those data sizes.

It depends on what you mean by "accept".
Some stores use a conversion tool at checkout to let customers pay in Bitcoin.  As a store owner, you still price your stuff and get paid in dear old dollars.  In effect, your customer is selling some Bitcoin for dollars, and the dollars go to you.  So, there's no risk to you.
Other stores actually run accounts in both Bitcoin and whatever their local national currency is.  When the "accept" Bitcoin, they really accept it.  If your supply chain is not in Bitcoin, that is if you're paying fiat to your suppliers, employees, etc... then at some point, you're going to have to sell some Bitcoin for local currency to pay your debts.  In that case, yes you are taking on an exchange risk.  
If Bitcoin goes up, you win, if it goes down you lose.  Maybe you can actively manage the risk by converting when you feel the rate is favourable to you.  Maybe overall, Bitcoin is kind to you in the long term with some occasional duckings.  But it is a risk, and you would need to satisfy yourself that the risk is worth taking.
I'm not trying to talk you out of it, I am Bullish on Bitcoin myself, but I wouldn't pretend that there is no risk in running any multicurrency business, especially if one of the currencies is volatile like Bitcoin.

I wouldn't agree that it has no use.  People use it every day.  I use it once a month to pay for my VPN, which is a much better option for me that using plastic.
I don't use it much yet in the real world.  There aren't many stores in my area that give me the option even if I wanted to.  This just adds to Bitcoin value.  There is huge room for increased adoption.
What would damage Bitcoin's value, in my view at least, would be changing strategic direction in response to a short term congestion issue.  Off-chain scaling is a far, far better solution than ginormous blocks, and I am happy that they keep focused on the big prize here.
I disagree profoundly with your characterisation of things, but I appreciate your frustration.  If you are convinced that Bitcoin is misguided and doing the wrong things, and that this will damage any savings you have in Bitcoin, then you should get out of it.  Protect yourself from the disaster you believe is coming.  Put your savings where you think that they will go, and use whatever means of exchange you want to pay for goods and services.  The choice is wide open.

There is nothing wrong with paper, but I would urge you to consider this.
Using a paper wallet, you have the private key printed on paper.  If anything happens that paper, everything is gone.  So you could store it in 2-3 copies in different places, but if any one of them is found, the coins can be stolen.
That's where [Shamir's Secret Sharing]( comes in.
It's just an algorithm, but it can take your private key. and represent it as a set of fragments.  You don't need all of the fragments to restore the key, you just need some of them.  And you decide on how many fragments and how many are required to restore the key when you set it up.
So... you could decide that you want 7 fragments, and that you need any 4 of them to reproduce the key.
You distribute the 7 fragments in to different locations - a home safe, a relative's house, a bank vault, a workplace.... whatever.  Now, you can afford for up to 3 of these locations to fail (maybe you get fired from work, maybe your safe gets swallowed in a sinkhole... whatever) and the remaining 4 fragments will allow you to access your key.
If the relative, whose house you have stored one of the fragments in, falls out with you he can't use his one fragment to get the the key - he would have to convince 3 others with access to other fragments to conspire with him.
It's free, safe and secure.

I hope to ignore 2X, because I expect it to be shortlived.  However, if a percentage of the fiat value of my current Bitcoin holding is shifted by the market into the fork coin, then it would not be unreasonable to want to protect the value of my investment by taking that percentage back into Bitcoin.  That's not something easily facilitated by the S2X attack, because the value of user funds is incidental to the exercise.
Some key indicators that this is not an upgrade but an attack.
1.  There's no indication that a majority of users want it.
2.  There's plenty of expert opinion that it's a duff solution
3.  It's built on a backversion of the core code, making it a step backwards, rather than an upgrade
4.  They haven't even bothered porting the bugfixes from Core into their code
5.  They haven't sought in any way to protect the value of user investments.

Having a limit makes Bitcoin deflationary.  No Quantitative Easing or banks magicking up extra money when it suits them.
Anyone can make a fork.  If you felt inclined, you could make a fork and change  the code so that the limit is 21 trillion of your new coins, or so that there is no limit.  You could think up some great name for your coin, but it wouldn't be Bitcoin.  Now you've got to go and convince the world of the value your new coin given that there can be trillions of them, or an infinite number. 
Alternatively, if you're not technically minded, you could skip the whole code aspect of it, and look for some other paradigm.  Maybe use pebbles.  There are lots of them.

Actually, I would say that the community you describe is a smaller group than you think - active crypto traders.  I don't believe that most people are doing that.  Nothing wrong with it, I just think it's something of a minority activity among those of use who have some Bitcoin.  It's certainly not me.  But, it's good to understand the perspective that you are coming from.  It helps to put your comments in perspective, but I still think we disagree on the fundamental logic.
Let's look at the comparison you make, in the only two options you give us:
Option A


Option B


What do these options have in common?  In both cases, you are taking the same amount of money out of Bitcoin.
In option A, you are gradually reducing your Bitcoin balance, day by day, purchase by purchase.  In option B, you take a whole year's worth out today.  So, with Option A, you keep your Bitcoin for as long as possible, to take advantage of any appreciation.
Your original context was:


So armed with the pre-knowledge of the appreciation of Litecoin and Bitcoin over the next 12 months, what is the clever thing to do.
In addition to your assumed appreciation rates, let's put in a few more so we can do math.  Feel free to tweak if you don't like my numbers.
Ipad cost: $300
Litecoin market price now: $55
Bitcoin market price now:  $7,300
Transaction fees:  Negligible
**Your recommended approach**
Buy the iPad with Litecoin.  You now have $700 worth of Litecoin, $1,000 worth of Butcoin.  12 months later, these balances become $770 in Litecoin, $2000 in Bitcoin, total value $2,770.
**My recommended approach**
Convert your Litecoin to Bitcoin, and buy the iPad.  You now have $1,700 worth of Bitcoin.  12 months later, this is worth $3,400.
Big difference.
The situation is even more extreme in your second situation where you take 12 month's living expenses out today.  If Bitcoin is going to appreciate in value, over the next 12 months, wouldn't it make sense to leave my money in Bitcoin, where it will accumulate, for as long as possible?  Why withdraw money now, as you suggest, that I won't need to spend for another 10 or 11 months?
None of this is, of course real world advice.  These are responses to your specific hypothetical.

Up to them, as far as I know.  If the traffic is more likely to be from A -&gt; B then A would put in 100%.
Chances are, though you wouldn't want to set up a channel just with Amazon.  You would set it up with someone already on the network that Amazon already has a channel on.  That way your $100 would be spendable at Amazon, or could be sent to anyone else on the network.

Pure market losses are one thing.  Losses that follow a fork, and that could be mitigated by selling the fork coin are different.  Replay protection would allow people to choose easily how they want to handle the fork.

Most (but not all) crytpo currencies are based on a "Proof of Work" algorithm, which requires miners to "mine" the coins, which also processes transactions.  Miners can choose between coins, and so sometimes things can back up temporarily on coin A if coin B is more profitable to mine. 
Bitcoin will be leveraging the Lightning Network to take a lot of its transactions off chain,so that the dependence on miners will be reduced, and transactions will be a lot faster than they currently are.  This tech is being pursued by a number of different projects (some commercial and some open source), and is currently available to test, however no production date is available yet.

How about 100 times as many users?  1,000 times?  How about each of them doing lots of transactions every day - buying a coffee,  getting petrol, paying a toll, paying for parking, accessing a paywalled article online, lunch, another coffee, etc etc throughout the day...

Probably missed the same question being asked every hour or two since yesterday.
There's no way to know if anyone will actually try to activate the fork.  It's pretty much assured that if anyone does try to run with the new code, they won't get support from anyone, and so the chain will quickly wither and die.
BUT it's still a fork without replay protection, so there's still the chance that some unlucky sod could find himself transacting on the forked chain.  So, it's always best to be cautious.

A hard fork?
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:29:42
Imagine you set up a pool of cash with your buddy.  You put $100 in because you expect to send some future transactions through your buddy and onto the wider network.  As far as anyone else is concerned, that $100 belongs to the two of you, and you two keep track of who owns how much of the $100.
Say your mate does the same thing with his other buddy Charlie.
Out of these two $100 pools of money
You own $100.
Your mate owns $100.
Charlie owns $0.
Let's say you want to send $20 to Charlie.  
You could go onto the blockchain and tell the world that "Hey you guys, I'm giving $20 to Charlie".  And wait for a miner to come along and pick it up, and wait for all the confirmations to come through.
You could tell your mate:
 "You know that $100 in our pool?  Let's say I now own $80, and you own $20. And can you pass the $20 I've just given you on to Charlie?"  
Your mate agrees and says to Charlie:
 "You know that $100 in our pool  Let's say I now own $80, and you own $20."
Now, out of those pools of cash:
You own $80.
Your mate still owns $100. ($20 + $80)
Charlie owns $20.
That's the basics, but instead of the three people being you, your mate, and his mate Charlie - all trusting each other because you know each other in real life, you are three strangers who trust each other because Bitcoin multisig addresses and smart contracts ensure that you can't rip each other off.
Finally, imagine that the whole world is involved and sending a payment becomes a game of seven degrees of Kevin Bacon, and these pools are called "channels".
No matter who you want to pay, you have a channel with someone who has a channel with someone who has a channel with someone... who has a channel with the person you want to pay.
Just like IP traffic bounces around the internet, your $20 bounces around the Lightning network to find the person you want to pay.
It may be possible that people along the way will charge you to use their channels, and so you get to set preferences around finding the fastest or cheapest route to your intended payee.
With every transaction, every one is keeping track of their individual channel.  Eventually when the smart contract upholding a channel becomes due, the two parties to that channel tell the rest of the world - "You know our $100?  Well I now own $15 of that and the other guy owns $85".
And that, kinda sorta, is how the Lightning Network works.

Lightning networks and off-chain tech generally is not developed by core.  There are multiple projects working on it.  However, because it's brand new stuff, to be launched onto a financial network of $100 billion plus, those projects are reasonably being cautious about setting any dates. 
They get kicked for not publishing a date until they are certain.  They would get kicked harder for publishing a date and missing it.
And they would get kicked hardest of all for rushing something out there and screwing up someone's money.

It's hard to use it as intended yet, because most places that "accept Bitcoin" don't accept Bitcoin.  They just give you a tool that you can use to sell your Bitcoin and they accept whatever the local fiat is.
So, you convert your fiat into BTC, and then when you want to buy something, you convert it back into fiat.  The retailer gets fiat, just as if you had actually handed them fiat.  That might be sorta fun, but it's not the revolution.

Who knows? With Wu's deep pockets, this could just be a last ditch attempt to make it look like S2X is still breathing.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:24:30


Nope.  BCH (how did you guess?) generally has very low transaction volumes, and when it becomes more profitable to mine after a bit of a famine, miners running at 40-50 blocks an hour can clear the backlog in no time.  Incidentally, that rate of block discovery is not good for BCH, so they are about to introduce a change to try to hit a stable 6 blocks per hour.


It should certainly insulate most transactions from effects.  With those not backlogging in the mempool it would take more effort to fill it.  It probably could still be done, but the impact would not be as severe.
Mining profitability is a thing anyway.  The block reward halvening is coming soonish (sooner to BCH).  At that point, the block reward will fall to 6.25 of which ever coin the miner is working on, and any remaining miner income will come from fees.

Coins are created through mining. The rules for how many coins a miner gets are well known and agreed. The only way to exceed the 21 million limit would be for a miner to claim a larger reward than the rules say. This claim would be rejected by the community.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:47:18
and the answer aboce is that he came up with 21 million because that was the answer when you plug in 50 BTC per block, with a halvening every 210000 blocks.
Maybe then the question becomes, "why 50 BTC to start with?" or "why halve every 210000 blocks?", but this answer explains why 21m Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin.  It's an alt which just put "Bitcoin" in its name, forked off and changed in a way that its proponents think is better. 
I've no idea why you think you know what all Chinese and Korean people are doing, but if you think you do, well good for you.
I agree, though, that the next few weeks are going to be a bit unpredictable.  Based on any available market and social data, it doesn't look like there's a market interest in S2X, and a number of its original backers have pulled out entirely or are ambivalent to it.  However, there are still some wealthy vested interests who really want it to succeed no matter what the market wants, and they're going to throw everything they've got at it.  I don't think they will have enough firepower to beat a community that doesn't want their takeover.

You earned funds build up in your account, until you reach the minimum withdrawal limit which might be .001 Bitcoin.  Until you reach that limit, you haven't made squat, because the dust is building up in their wallet, not yours.
I suspect that most people who sign up with a faucet realise that it's a waste of effort long before they hit the withdrawal limit, and just walk away.  This means that the faucet operator got them to do his crap (which *he* gets paid for) for free.

Because if every purchase of every coffee, and every stick of gum, and every micropayment for every web service, and every other thing that we spend money on now, and could potentially spend money on in the future because we can't now... if all of those are recorded in perpetuity on the ledger, then grow to blocksizes so huge that validation will be more and more centralised.  At that point, we might as well be using banks, when we rely on others to process and validate every transaction for us.  We won't have overthrown banks, we will have created new ones.
There are also security and privacy benefits from not having everything on the blockchain too.


Indeed it's not.  Anyone who wants to pay for a coffee in Bitcoin is perfectly free to do so, it's just not always going to be very convenient for them to do so yet.  And by the grace of the market, they are free to choose another coin or fiat if they prefer that experience.


And when you focus your attention on big blocks as the solution, then you concentrate more and more power in the hands of those who can afford to process those big blocks.  We will have replaced one set of instutions with another.

There is no 'social contract'. Mining is a profitable enterprise. Even if all miners abandoned a coin new miners can come to take their place. If the barrier to entry is too high, the proof of work algorithm can be changed.
Not all cryptos even use POW, and not all of those who do use the same POW and so not all coins are competing for the same miners.
The ecosystem is more diverse than you seem to appreciate.
Bitcoin's future takes a lot of transactions off chain, removing the need for a miner to process every single micropayment.

But they may lose value if both coins survive and, say, 15% of your current Bitcoin value is shifted to S2X.

Not necessarily.
If B is A's only entry node onto the network, and A expects to push a lot a lot of coin through the network, then A might open a channel with B, where funds the channel with 100 BTC.  B has contributed nothing to the chanel and may not even have any funds. D might do likewise to open a 100 BTC channel with B.  And so on.  B might decide to open a 10 BTC channel with C in anticipation of future business with C.
Now A can send coin to B who sends one to C.  Maybe C then sends one to B who sends it to D.  
In a mature network with lots of nodes, there are likely to be lots of flows in multiple directions. And again, for large payments it probably makes more sense to transact on chain.

If you send Bitcoin from address A to address B, the lack of replay protection means that transaction can also be applied to S2X coins on the S2X chain. Or vice versa.
So if you send me some S2X, you could also unintentionally send me the same number of Bitcoin.
Replay protection would ensure that transactions on one chain are not valid on the other.
The lack of replay protection in S2X puts people's bitcoins at risk, but that's seemingly not an issue for the remaining S2X proponents.

It certainly is.  It is not mine to set, but as I own the valued asset, it's my value.


I'm not attempting to profit from anything, not that there's anything wrong with that.  I am attempting to protect my existing value.  If the value of my Bitcoin is divided between Bitcoin and the forked coin, then I want to be able to do with that value what I want.

Someone could replay the transaction out of malice. Alternatively, the transaction could get played onto the wrong chain through a misunderstanding, misconfiguration, or whatever. The fact is that S2X have placed our coins at risk for their assault on the BTC ticker.
They've also placed S2X users at specific risk by basing their alt on an old version of the core software, without backporting any fixes. Think about that one for a sec. Their code has known defects / vulnerabilities, for which the code changes have been written. S2X just hasn't bothered copy pasting the fixes into their code.

BCH is a bit of a mess.
It has survived thus far purely thanks to its EDA. This is a miner magnet which makes it easier to mine than Bitcoin, if miners have been ignoring it for too long. Predictably, what this has led to is occasional mining frenzies followed by mining droughts. During the frenzies, there can be 40 - 50 blocks mined per hour, instead of 'Satoshi's vision' of 6. As of now, there are many thousands more BCH blocks than Bitcoin blocks mined. This, in turn, means that the halvening will come to BCH long before it does to Bitcoin. This will halve the number of BCH that miners earn for each block. To counter this, some new miner attractant will be needed, accelerating the *next* halvening and so on...
As more and more coins are doled out to the miners in this way, there will be less and less to give them which will cause am unending fees race.
The fundamentalist insistence that every transaction be on chain simply won't scale as more people and more devices generate more transactions.
Ultimately, BCH serves a mining cartel until it will be sucked dry.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:28:57
Hard to say. There's no way 90% of miners are going to be mining it from the get go. That's not what intent signalling means; the number is closer to, and sometimes below 80; and with S2X having the same difficulty but a fraction of the value of Bitcoin, only the most committed of miners are going to offer their services at a discount.

The market value of my coins is indeed mine.  If the fiat equicvalent value of my prefork Bitcoin is divided 85/15 between my post-fork Bitcoin and the new coin, then I would like to simply be able to sell my new coin to whoever wants it and put the proceeds back into Bitcoin.
Replay protection would have made that easy for me and for all others who hold some of the $120 billion worth of Bitcoins.  But that's not how S2X rocks.  Making things easy for users to protect the value of their investments is not a requirement of the fork.  The only requirement is sezing control of the Bitcoin name.
It's pretty clear that they've already failed at that, so they should just do the decent thing and call the attack off.  But doing the decent thing would be uncharted territory for some of those folks.

Because "Bitcoin Segwit" is not a thing, and "Bitcoin" has global recognition, and is traded daily under that name.
Rebranding any competing currency to the same name will risk confusing customers and having them ripped off when someone offers to sell them Bitcoin at a discount rate and all they get is Bitcoin Cash, a different crypto, that's not great for the user.  Remember her?  The user?  Try not to defraud users.
Let the market decide.  See who likes Bitcoin, and see who likes Bitcoin Cash.  But if you try to call them both the same thing, then you remove freedom of choice from the user who can't be sure what any party they are dealing with means when they say Bitcoin.  That's not how grown up markets decide.  It's also probably not a mess that exchanges will want to create for themselves.

Lightning network and other solutions can facilitate off chain transactions. Miners get no transaction fees from off chain transactions. For very large miners and miner manufacturers this is not a pleasing vista.
With a halving of the block reward coming up, transaction fees are going to be more important to miners. 
So that's one contentious area. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:18:44
You said it shouldn't be easy to spam the network, usually one stops a network from being spammed by stopping the spam.


It will always be easier to pump more data into any system than to scale it indefinitely to handle everything.  Especially in a relatively decentralised system, when no-one is at the centre buying and planning all the hardware.
There are limits everywhere - mining capacity, nodes, network capacity.  Making the front door ever bigger doesn't solve that.  It just pushes the problem deeper into the system where issues might be harder to fix.  What's needed is a fundamental change.
Offchain transactions is the most promising thing in progress that I can see to greatly increase capacity.
It's not here yet, and no-one can say for sure when it will be.
For now I don't use Bitcoin for day-to-day spending. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:26:03
There's a few things to address here.  
First off, you would be better off having a balance of Bitcoin in your wallet, so that you're not trying to buy and sell Bitcoin at the same time to make your purchase.  With this approach, you're only comparing BTC to BTC, and not multiple $/BTC rates.
This approach will also help your issue with rates making up a large percentage of the amount you want to transfer.  Network fees are not based on the dollar value you are transacting.  So the more you transfer at a time, the better value you will get.
Thirdly, I've never used coinbase but I see it get a bad rep here for slow credit of fiat to your account and for pretty steep fees.   I'd suggest looking into a better alternative.
So, to summarise on the above... transfer higher dollar amounts into your wallet, instead of lots of small transfers, so that you reduce your overall fees, and have less trouble understanding how much you need to pay the shop.  And look for a better wallet.  
You still might not be delighted with the fees, but it should save you a good chunk.
All of this will change when Lightning and other off chain transactions go live.  It's a frustrating wait, but transactions will be far cheaper and take seconds rather than waiting for the next 10 minute block.  That is the "better way", unfortunately, it's not here yet.

Not necessarily.  That's down to the market.  if the market decides that 7% of the value of my Bitcoin has shifted to S2X, then I'd like to be able to get that 7% back while people are still available to buy it.  But I would like to be able to do that without sending the buyer the 93% I have in Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-07 10:38:05
No reason at all.
Buy and sell when you think is appropriate.  Just one word of caution.  Check with your exchange if they are going to cease Bitcoin trades in the immediate runup to the fork.  I *think* I saw that some of them are stopping trades 1 day before the fork and restarting when then think it's safe.  
If you do decide to sell before the fork, you don't want to find out that you missed your chance.

If he said he'd seen the manufacturing facility, I'd be more impressed. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:04:31
No.  It's done by the system itself.
I'm referring to Bitcoin Cash's ill-conceived Emergency Difficulty Adjustment.  Designed to make sure its chain wasn't abandoned, if there are periods of little mining activity, it drops the mining difficulty until miners come back because the ease of mining compensates for the lower reward (itself caused by the lower dollar value of Bitcoin).
When the difficulty is sufficiently low, a bunch of miners come back to mine.  Because it's so low, they mine new blocks way faster than intended.
Let me show with graphs.
[This chart]( shows the number of blocks mined per hour on both the Bitcoin (yellowish) and Bitcoin Cash (blue) line.  Note how Bitcoin tends to hover along in a reasonably consistent tunnel, but Bitcoin Cash has massive peaks showing miner frenzies when the low difficulty means mining is like taking cash from a baby.  These sever spikes are brief because the difficulty readjusts, and the miners go back to mining Bitcoin again.
This [next chart]( shows the net effect of this.  The block count on Bitcoin Cash is nearly 8,000 higher than on Bitcoin, and the gap is increasing.  This means that Bitcoin Cash will hit the halvening (block 630,000) sooner than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:22:53
Comparison with the last two forks is futile.  It's a very different situation.
The last fork was Bitcoin Gold.  This had replay protection, but hasn't even gone live yet.
The one before that was Bitcoin Cash.  This had replay protection, and so it was perfectly safe to buy/sell Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash immediately after the fork.
This next one, there is no replay protection and people moving things around could find themselves with unintended consequences.  As such price impact is unlikely to be the same as for the previous two.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:38:09
Happy to accept the semantic correction.  When I said I own the value of my coins, it would probably have been more correct to say I own the right to exchange my coins for whatever price I can get for them.


Because it is my asset, and if there is a market for it, I ought to be able to sell it just as easily as selling any other asset, without the risk of losing my Bitcoin asset.
Again, I know that this is not a perspective shared by the proponents of this attack, but it's a pretty basic user requirement.

It's not about the storage.
It's about being able to download and validate a block in 10 minutes.
If we want just 10 times as many people using Bitcoin, for 10 times as many purchases, with transactions happening 10 times as fast on average as they are now, then forget your 100MB blocks, you're talking about 1GB blocks.
That's 1GB for every node to download and validate in 10 minutes.
And that's still a very modest goal.  It certainly doesn't bring us to mainstream adoption.  You would need to lift it up by a couple more orders of magnitude before you're approaching credit/debit card usage, and a couple more before you're approaching cash.
Short answer is that it can't work.

Let me add Segwit2X, then.  What this showed is that Bitcoin is not the miners and some other service providers.  Bitcoin is the users.  In a decentralised network where nodes are the ultimate arbitrar of what the consensus is, we decide what our coin is.
Never forget that victory, and remember how we won.  Decentralisation and nodes matter.  They allow us to retain control over the definition of Bitcoin.  Lose these, and you allow some cartel to define Bitcoin.

Not sure what you mean here.
You can buy x Bitcoin for $500, where x is determined by the market price when and where you buy.  Say 1 Bitcoin is valued at $10k.  Your $500 will get you 0.05 Bitcoin.
If the dollar value of Bitcoin increases 10% to $11k, your 0.05 Bitcoin is now worth $550. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:52:45


That's wrong for a start.  Signalling proposal intent is not an indication of what miners are actually going to do.  How the pools signal intent varies by pool.  For example, ViaBTC (&gt;15% of the hash rate) is still signaling Yes, but ave said that they will initially [mine only Bitcoin](
Also, for what it's worth, the figure has been falling.
As to why, I'm sure it varies.
Some pools are owned or heavily influenced by BitMain.  As well as operating a mining pool, and having a large stake in other companies that run pools,  BitMain also manufactures mining equipment, which they currently only sell for BCH.  Increasing BitMain's control/influence on Bitcoin strategy by displacing the current development team is a big vertical integration for BitMain.
There are others, who while not owned by BitMain, don't want to scupper their chances of getting access to new mining rigs asap, and so may at least look like they support his plan.
Bitcoin.com (Ver's pool) is switching all miners to S2X when the fork happens.  Obviously, he's a major pusher of S2X.  His hash rate seems to have declined form nearly 2% to closer to 1%, suggesting that this move has led miners to move to other pools
Other may see offchain scaling as a hit on a key revenue stream and so want to keep pushing BigBlock solutions.
Other miners/pools may be acting purely out of integrity and genuinely believe that S2X is the right thing to do.
Ultimately, there are probably as many different reasons as there are miners.  But I don't think there is any way in hell that anything close to 80% of miners are going to mine S2X for a fraction of the reward of mining Bitcoin.

So it's good that we are working on a solution that can scale, that can provide near-instant payment (instead of waiting for a block to be processed) and doesn't need to pay miner fees for every transaction.

Calling me a troll for disagreeing with your perspective doesn't help the tone here.  
We have just seen a move driven in large part by miners to change the rules.  Leave aside for a moment that you thought it was a good change, the next one might not be one you agree with.  One of the main reasons why this change was stopped was the refusal of more and more nodes to validate those changes.  Initially, we were told that nodes don't matter.  Then there was a bit of a development tit for tat where core nodes were upgraded to drop nodes signalling for the change, and the nodes that were for the change stopped signalling.  Then a large number of change-supportive nodes was spun up on the cloud.
It looks like nodes do matter after all.  And if we push nodes further away from users as we have already done with mining, then we take that power away from regular users.  No longer will someone with a desktop, a laptop or a pi have *any* say in the consensus rules.
And that's where the Animal Farm scenario comes into play.  We will look from the Banks to the Jihan Wus and we will not be able to tell them apart. 
You fear of patents is entirely misdirected.  Blockstream's patents are released in perpetuity under the Defensive Patent License.  That puts them into the community.  You know some patents that aren't in the community?  Bitmain's patents on ASIC development for mining.

here's a quick splainer I typed up:
It's light on the technical detail because it's intended as an ELI5.  
There is face-off happening here.
On the one hand you have multiple teams working on implementing off-chain transactions as a way to address multiple issues including blockchain size, transaction speed, fees, privacy and a whole lot more.  
On the other hand, you have the "Keep Everything on the Blockchain" approach which relies on linear scaling of Blocksize as the way to deal with fees and transaction times.
Some Core developers (but not many 11/300+) draw Blockchain salaries, but the code maintainer is with MIT.  Additional tiering is generally recognised as good architecture, with a lot of support from the community, including Blockstream.  Some put these facts together to call conspiracy.
For me, the conspiracy is more evident on the other side of the debate, but that's probably beyond the scope of your question, but let's for balance just say that a single company has a near-monopoly on mining rig manufacture, and owns or invests in a number of the bigger mining pools, so they have a vested interest in miner income.
There's no evidence that Core are planning anything stupid like you say. From an engineering quality point of view, it's worth comparing the track record of Core deliveries with the failure to launch of S2X.  Not that that's a particularly fair comparison.  One the one hand you have a large, open source development project with robust SDLC, and on the other you, well, don't.

The fork is an attempt by a group of business interests, including the main mining cartel,  to seize control of the direction Bitcoin. They are doing so in a way that could cause harm to anyone trying to move / spend coins soon after the fork (research s2x and lack of replay protection).
If you are ready to hold for some time after the fork, then you will be fine.

A and B agree the value of their channel, likewise B and C. If A wants to route a large payment through to C, then A will need to have a sufficiently funded channel with B. If B does not have a sufficiently large channel with C, I believe that the transaction will try to find another route or routes.
Really, though, for very large tranactions, it might be easiest to keep them on chain.

Lots of places that "accept Bitcoin" really just use a checkout converter that allows the user to sell the required amount of bitcoin to pay the shop in dollars (or whatever local currency).  So first off, good for you that you're considering the implications of actually accepting Bitcoin.
The risks are similar to any foreign exchange risk, albeit multiplied somewhat because of the increased volatility.
If you buy widgets for yuan in China and sell them for dollars in the US, then you are taking some foreign exchange risk.
The same applies if you buy for dollars and sell for Bitcoin.  With the increased volatility, you might find yourself tempted to reprice everything daily in BTC if not more frequently.  But then you are passing the volatility onto your customers which can drive them away.
It gets worse when you accept both dollars and bitcoin, because then everything has two prices and the customer can choose which to pay, unless you "lock in" the price in one of them (say dollars) and convert to BTC at checkout.  Again, this can be offputting to customers as they see dollar prices when they want to pay in Bitcoin.
Your exchange risk also lasts through your returns period.  If the customer buys in Bitcoin, and then returns the item, will you do the transparent thing and refund the Bitcoins they paid?  Or will you return today's Bitcoin equivalent of the sale date dollar equivalent of the bitcoins they paid?  That is, if the customer paid 1 BTC when 1 BTC was worth $4,500, will you refund them 1 BTC or will you refund them $4,500 worth of Bitcoin at today's rate?  To truly "accept" bitcoin, you would need to do the former.
At a minimum, then, you should consider holding enough Bitcoin to meet your likely Bitcoin returns.  While they are your coins, you expect your customers to come looking for them back.  It's like you are holding them in trust.
After that, you want to consider how much, if any, of your cost of goods and business you pay in Bitcoin.  You need to be setting aside the Bitcoin to be covering that.
On top of that you add a percentage for margin of error, and maybe some more as an investment (how much of this you can add will depend on your margins and your risk tolerance, and you may decide to vary it based on market conditions).
You can mitigate the risks by trying find suppliers and service providers that accept Bitcoin, and locking down your future costs with them.  You guarantee them the future business if they guarantee you the price.  The more of your ecosystem that deals exclusively in dollars, the smaller the risk that you take on.
Of course, with any risk, you also look to hedging.  When the dollar is weak against Bitcoin, stockpile the items you buy in dollars.  When it flips around, stockpile your Bitcoin denominated purchases.  Both subject to the maximum levels it makes sense to buy.
TLDR - the percentage will depend completely on the business, and its appetite for risk

I'm already hodling, and if you want to buy more coins, I sure won't try to talk you out of it.  I just think your faith in the halvening surge is a bit misplaced, I would expect the halvening pricing effect diminishes each time.  Each time the halvening occurs, the absolute change in the number of coins in the mining reward drops, and as a percentage of coins already in production, the impact is smaller and smaller.
But, if you're right, and 2020 will see a runup to a doubling in the value of my coins, I'll happily take that.

Quite often, the price is higher for a reason. Let's say you buy coin for $1,000 on exchange A and sell for $1,050 on exchange B. What do you next?
The price is too high on B, so you need to withdraw the cash from B and send it to A so you can buy more and repeat the process. But it turns out it's slow to get cash out of B. Maybe it takes a week.
So, a week later you have $1,050, ignoring any exchange fees. In that time, the price of coin has gone up, and your original $1,000 would now be worth $1,100 if you hadn't sold it.

Think of it this way, using round numbers
Say your pizza costs $8 and a Bitcoin is worth $4,000.  The pizza price can be expressed as $8 or 0.002 BTC.  
Say further that at date x in the future that 0.002 BTC will be worth $1 million.
That's your the scenario you're scared of, right?
If you buy your pizza with bitcoin, what do you do with the $8 cash that you didn't spend on pizza?
If you buy $8 worth of Bitcoin to replace the Bitcoin you spent on pizza, you can kick yourself in the future for being the guy who spent 0.002 BTC on pizza instead of leaving it in Bitcoin, which would now (on date x) be worth a million dollars.
   
*Sure, you replaced the BTC, but it's still .002 BTC less than you would have if you hadn't bought the pizza.*
If you leave the $8 in your pocket, you're going to spend it on something else eventually, right?  You can kick yourself in the future for being the guy who spent 0.002 BTC on a pizza, and compounded it by spending 0.002 BTC worth of dollars on "something else" instead of buying the Bitcoin, which would now (on date x) be worth a million dollars.
If you buy your pizza with dollars, you can kick yourself in the future for being the guy who spent 0.002 BTC worth of dollars on pizza instead of buying the Bitcoin, which would now (on date x) be worth a million dollars.
TLDR In short, future you can kick yourself for every dollar you didn't put into Bitcoin, and for every satoshi you spent.  But you gotta eat.

1) because if you leave them on an exchange, you don't hold the private key.  if the exchange disappears or gets hacked, you lose everything.  Transaction fees are small.
2) Depends on where the coins are.  If it's a real exchange, you can sell for the current rate, or you can specify a price and hope they sell at that price.  Coinbase isn't a real exchange.
3) No idea.  If you post the blockchain transaction ID, we can take a look.  But as you're on coinbase, you probably have no idea what the ID is.
4) I'm not American, and I've never used Coinbase, but everything I hear about it smells like a bit of a ripoff.  It may be convenient, but it seems you pay a lot for the convenience.

Nope.  It was good as it was.
So long as either chain is profitable, the miner can jump between them.  If one proves more profitable in the long-term than the other, then that's where the miner will end up.
Gaming the system seems like trying to improve the chances of one chain over the other, as if the miner has a vested interest beyond merely mining the more profitable chain.
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:57:15
Emergency Difficulty Adjustment.  If not enough miners are mining BCash, they drop the difficulty to lure them back.  Given that there are very few transactions on that chain, it led to period frenzies when miners were getting easy BCH doing pointless work.  If allowed to continue, this would have led to inflation as all the extra BCH came onto the market, and could have triggered an early "halvening" when the reward per block is halved.

Government agencies, most likely, but also potentially hackers or rogue employees.
How an individual transaction might be traced to an IP depends a lot on how the transaction was processed.  For a transaction done through an exchange, the exchange will have full details.  For others, you might have to get at the logs of the node that accepted the transaction.
Of course while the IP is of interest, it is not what is most interesting to those trying to establish the identity of the holder of a wallet. Having got sufficient evidence, through methods already described, that an individual might be the person behind some transactions of interest, a search of their phone or other devices might reveal a lot more.

Who said the  coins were bought back in 2012?
But the same thing applies, pretty much.  Let's say you anonymously bought/mined back in the day before it was attracting any attention.  Let's even imagine that back then you weren't using gox or some online wallet that you even registered to an email address.  At this point, you're ruling out gox, blockchain.info, and a lot of the other services that were available in 2012.  But let's imagine you have a completely anonymous paper wallet with a million bucks worth in it.  No registration.  No IP logs.
So long as you leave it there, it is anonymous.  But it's also borderline useless unless you trade or spend it at some point.  Start moving it about and you start risking that anonymity.  Sell your coins to someone, buy something with them, move them to another address... every time you touch them, you add something more to the information associated with them.  At some point, possibly with the collusion of a bad or state actor, it might just become enough to hint at your identity.
Under perfect circumstances, it *might* all stay anonymous.  But it's far safer to consider it pseudonymous.  An individual transaction might not reveal your identity to a casual observer, but over time, and with access to additional information, someone might be able to identify you.

One possibility, someone filled in a Coinbase application form and gave your address.  Coinbase reasonably sent you a verification email to check.  Not sure what else you expect Coinbase to do, and the chances of ever finding out who gave your email address and why are pretty slim.
Another possibility is that it's a phishing mail. Clicking on the link confirms to the attacker that you are susceptible to phishing, and even if you don't enter any details this time, maybe you will in response to another one.  However, you seem to suggest that you have checked the details and ruled this out.
A third possibility is that this is some sort of marketing where they are basically inviting you to create an account.
A fourth possibility is that the small print of some T&amp;C's you accepted someplace asked Coinbase to create an account for you.
In any of the above cases, I'm still unsure what course of action you feel would be more productive than ignoring it.

Bitstamp is fine as an exchange. 
You can buy bitcoin on bitstamp, but transfer to a wallet you own asap. Unless you plan on daytrading.

Yes. There are shops online and offline where you can spend bitcoin. Some even give a discount for it.
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:12:15
Sorry, but I disagree pretty fundamentally with this.
A lot of shops that "accept bitcoin" don't, in fact, accept bitcoin.  They hook up with some conversion service.  You pay bitcoin, the conversion service changes it to Zloty or whatever, and the shop gets paid in Zloty.  The shop never touches the bitcoin.
So what this boils down to is that you sell your Bitcoin to get zloty to pay for your slice of pizza.  
Assuming that you get paid in zloty, you buy Bitcoin with your zloty, then you sell Bitcoin for zloty to buy pizza.  Converting zloty to and from Bitcoin in the middle of that flow doesn't really add any intrinsic value to the Bitcoin ecosystem, and isn't what I think (to use your phrase) Bitcoin "was intended to be".  
It's no different to just carrying around your zloty in an old leather wallet, taking zloty out when you want to buy something, and pretending they are called "Bitcoin" when they are in your wallet.  Except that by doing this, you don't have to pay any conversion fees.
If you want to actually make a difference, ask your employer to pay you in Bitcoin.  Ask your pizza place to really accept Bitcoin, ask their suppliers to really accept Bitcoin.

If you plan on keeping for the long term, you need to lock them up offline.
In theory, this means transferring to a wallet whose private key has never been used,  and then storing that private key (which is just a string of characters) someplace or some places really safe. This protects your coins from third parties going bankrupt, or hackers, viruses, hardware failures etc
There are many strategies for offline storage. Hardware wallets like Trezor give you a balance of security and convenience.

Not too long back, the mempool received a large number of large sized transaction with minimal/zero fees. This ensured a lot of transactions in the mempool for some time, and triggered a fees race, which wasn't really necessary.  So for a time "slow transactions and high fees" was common theme.
In an astonishing coincidence, this coincided with the runup and immediate aftermath of the birth of Bitcoin Cash - an altcoin which needed to gain some traction.  There's no way, at all, that this could have been anything other than a glut of regular users, and definitely not a timed attack to highlight the fact that a new alt with next to no transactions could process those transactions.

What do you mean by "blockchain wallet"?  Is that a wallet on blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:32:51
Those transactions are showing fees of 5 &amp; 7 sat/byte, there are tens of thousands in the mempool with higher fees.
There's 5-6 blocks being mined per hour at the moment, so if has you covered you should start seeing confirmations in less than an hour.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:42:02
That's what I did. If you did a month ago, you might have caught an exchange rate of about 0.14 BTC for each BCH. A couple of weeks ago, you'd have got 0.12. Today, it's .104.
Simple to change at changelly.  
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:17:45
I think that sat/byte makes sense for miners, so I don't think we can get away from it.  It's more about the presentation and the technology.  Dust makes transactions dear, so de-dustify on the cheap when blocks are empty.  A lot of crypto folks do this as a matter of course, but it's not exactly "retail".
As to the kid in his bedroom, there are many of them.  They have already launched their currencies.  There are tons of them out there, and new ones being launched all the time.  Many of them don't use miners at all.
We've no idea what the future holds.  I just hope it's not appley.

I'm willing to hear better.  As of now, there are over 35,000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, 20MB in size - rough numbers.  With transaction fees loads higher than they were when the burst happened.  BCH has about 20% of the mining power.
To me this looks like a chance to tut and point at the waiting times and transaction fees that the burst caused.
The more optimistic narrative is what, that the glut of high-fee transactions was introduced by some actor to keep miners on the Bitcoin chain for the big fees?  Doesn't that mean that Bitcoin users are hit not just with long confirmation times (as they would also have if more miners left Bitcoin for a while) but also with high fees (which they would not have if more miners left Bitcoin for a while).

The fees will vary. There's no way around that.  
People didn't face that with other payments because the layers of middlemen traded on the variances that they encountered. 
With no middlemen, there's noone to set rates and absorb fluctuations. If you want person to person that's part of the deal. If you want insulation and predictability, you will need a different model, such as I've described elsewhere in this thread.
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:22:05
I wonder if this is some opportunistic manipulation.  
Dump 6,000 odd transactions with a total size of 20MB into the mempool with an excessive transaction fee just around the time of the difficulty shift.  The amount of work to be done steps up just as BTC temporarily loses some hash rate.
It's only a temporary effect, most of the 120+ sat/byte transactions have already been processed, but if you wanted to punish users for using Bitcoin instead of Bcash, it could do so temporarily.

It would be the introduction of a new big HODLer into the market, every coin they buy would be taken off the market, just as every other HODLed coin is.

Hard to say without more info and maybe a transaction ID.
One possibility is that you mistyped the number of Bitcoin to send, maybe getting the decimal point in the wrong place so you only sent a fraction of what you thought you did. In that case the unknown address is a change address and the coins should still be visible in your Electrum wallet.

Bitcoin and crypto are in their infancy. I believe that there's no way back from crypto, and I think Bitcoin will stay the distance. I also think that there will be other giants too. 
The crypto that excels at online micro payments may not be the best one for instore coffee purchases, and neither of these might be the best for larger purchases, or anonymity, or transparency, or contract payments, or portability, or as a store of wealth that can easily surive your death...

@_date: 2017-09-14 09:27:19
Nothing of note has really happened.
There's been FUD about China banning bitcoin, which happens every so often.  In fact, the real story is that Bitcoin exchanges in China were reviewed and it was found that some of them don't apply some of the same controls as are required in other regulated financial entities.
And there was the head of some US banking outfit saying that Bitcoin is a scam.
Really, I think what's happened is that we had a positive reinforcement cycle where new money came into chasing daily All Time Highs in bitcoin.  And some of these new bitcoiners were scared off as they encountered these old tropes for the first time.
In reality, Bitcoin has pulled back to levels which were record highs about a month ago and is up over 250% in six months.
Or to put it another way, business as usual in Bitcoin land.

Well, it relies on the hypothesis that someone knowledgeable enough to wait for a period of low transaction fees to gather their dust would then set extra high transaction fees when doing so on thousands of transactions, many of which were initiated hours later when the fees had already been increased by their initial series of whoopsies.
I'm not seeing the plausibility there.

@_date: 2018-02-18 18:12:23
We seem to have missed each other somewhere along the way, so let's try again...
Person has coins in address A.  
Person buys something mail order sending payment to the retailer and the change goes to address B.  The nosey retailer now knows that addresses A and B most probably belong to Person.
Person now does some other transaction from address B, with some coins going to address C and the others going to address D.
At this point, in the absence of any further information, nosey retailer knows that it's likely that one of addresses C or D belongs to Person, but doesn't really know which one.
Later person buys again from nosey retailer, paying with coins from address D.  This second transaction makes it even more likely  that addresses B and reveals that address D probably belongs to Person.
None of this relies on any address reuse.  Just one input and output transaction for each address.  Watching the series of transactions grow, and potentially getting more information by posing as a retailer that Person would be interested in or subpoenaing some of the actors that Person has exchanged coins with, or perhaps their ISP, or whatever, more information can be added, further eroding the anonymity that Person might have expected had they been misinformed about Bitcoin.


Your original question was based on the assertion that "Bitcoin is not anonymous".  I think it's pretty clear that it this is true.  Everything else you have added to the context in your latest reply such as the use of VPN's and mixers, are extra steps you can take to try to make your use of Bitcoin as hard to trace as possible, but these steps are are only required precisely *because* Bitcoin is not anonymous on its own.

Pretty simple. Over the past while, there was a flow from alts into Bitcoin as people wanted to be holding Bitcoin for the 'free' Bitcoin Gold.
Now that that moment has passed, that money is rushing back out to whatever alts it came from.
This triggers a drop in BTC/USD, a rise in alts/USD, and an increase in the number of non-segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:15:22
It might not be possible to do this without sending your BTC to wherever you send your B2X to sell them.

OK, so there may be two things you can do.

2.  If you have your twelve word seed, you can tell Blockchain that you have forgotten your "main" password and it will create a brand new account for you, transferring your funds.  See [this video](

First off, you're going to be using your private key, so the first thing is to move your bitcoin from their current paper wallets to new ones to keep them safe.
If you have Android, the simplest solution is to install coinomi.  This can hold BTC and BCH wallets.  And it has an inbuilt exchange feature using shapeshift, to make it trivial to transfer from one to the other.
So you would sweep the BCH into your coinomi BCH wallet and transfer to its BTC wallet.

This is a very, very silly argument.  No matter whether you buy your pizza with dollars or bitcoin, you paid the same amount, and you made the choice to eat pizza and not to leave/put that amount in Bitcoin.  
Personally, I have two Bitcoin stashes.  One is my hodlings which is like a savings account, and I don't touch them.  The other is like a current/checking account, and I spend them, topping up when I need to.  
Still, a lot of the time, when you "spend" bitcoin, you're not really spending it.  You're selling it and giving dollars to the store.  It just happens that they provide the sales tool.

Services like changelly will convert directly from one crypto to another. No need to go near Kraken.
You just need to send the BCH to the address that they give you and they will send the Bitcoin to the address you give them.

Look at it this way. 
You have x BTC and that BTC will be worth more dollars next month than it is today. You also have y dollars. Inflation eats away at the purchasing power of your dollar.
You are thinking about buying something for $z
You could:
* Not buy the thing and buy $z more Bitcoin instead
* Use your $z to buy the thing instead of buying more bitcoin
* Use your $z to buy more bitcoin and also use $z worth of bitcoin to buy the thing
All of the above boil down to 'Do you want to spend $z on bitcoin or on the thing?'
Trying to spin it as 'Do you buy the thing with Bitcoin or dollars' assumes that (a) you will buy the thing and (b) if you buy it with bitcoin, you won't pre-empt this by preconverting the dollars to bitcoin.
Or to look at it another way, if Bitcoin is deflationary and dollars inflationary, why wouldn't you convert every single dollar to bitcoin on payday? Then you make every purchase with bitcoin and each day all the unspent portion of your converted paycheck is worth a little more against the dollar denominated purchases you will make later in the month.

You can probably get better answers on [This guy]( posts an update every month, I think.  His latest assessment is that an Ant Miner S9 will get you 1.34 Bitcoin per year.  You make your own guess as to the local currency value of that Bitcoin at the end of the year - then figure out what the cost of mining that are (cost of hardware, electricity, cooling, etc)
Bitcoin mining difficulty has just stepped up as well. I don't remember if the video above allows for that.

Wow, there's a lot that seems wrong there in relatively few words.


Show us the numbers.


Very, very hard to regulate private agreements between consenting parties.  They can regulate fiat, sure.  They can even shut down an exchange or two.  But the toothpaste is out of the tube now.  Bitcoins exist.  People have them, they can trade them with each other for goods and services. 


Blockchain is indeed being investigated for uses other than Bitcoin, but I fail to see how this is a bad thing.  The public record of a blockchain can be used to for tracing food from farm to fork, verifying the source and history of a diamond, smart contracts... all sorts of stuff.  
I don't see any of this as anything but good.
What uses traditional finance houses will make of the blockchain remains to be seen, but they're hardly investigating it just to support "crime and tax evasion" now, are they?  Would Big Finance ever do such a thing?

I think the sat/byte mining fee is too complex for widespread adoption.  Having to work out the size of the transaction, then seeing what recent fees were, figuring out how long you are willing to wait for this transaction, and using recent block rates to turn the time you are prepared to wait into a number of blocks, and then figuring out the right sat/byte to give your transaction a good chance of being processed in the time you want... it's all do'able, but it's not the road to mass adoption.
So, yeah I think there's lots of room for improvement in wallet features. Ideally you want something which will automatically defrag your stash, combining dust into bigger balances when the price is low, so that your transaction sizes when you really need to send coin are as low as possible.
Maybe, for those who want it, you could export the risk to a third party.  You pay an annual subscription to a service which will guarantee you a flat fee.  Your wallet still figures out the right fee for each transaction and sends it as normal, but if that's higher than your subscribed fee, the third-party service will refund the difference.  Sure, it means sharing some of your transaction details with a third party, but no-one's forcing anyone into it.
Lots of room for usability improvement yet.  That's one of the reasons I am convinced we are in the infancy of this tech.

For me, it means wanting people's funds to be protected - so that moving one post-fork coin doesn't risk the other one being moved too.
It means letting users safely choose what to do with their coins, not opting them into something that they might not want anything to do with.
It means gaining adoption of your change through users wanting to use it, instead of forcing an upgrade on them as if you own Bitcoin.
It means leaving Bitcoin decision making to the community instead of to a backroom cartel whose interests may be very different to those of the users who pay them.

Yep, makes sense.  I laminate, so it's good.
If you are looking at using paper wallets for the long term, you might want to consider something like [Shamir's Secret Sharing](
This allows you to represent your private key as a number of individual chunks, which you only need some of to retrieve the whole key.
Say, you have a 3/5 split.  This lets you store 5 fragments in different locations.  Maybe a home safe, a bank vault, your brother's house, and some other secure locations.
Any two of those could be wiped off the planet, and you could still reassemble your key.  But if your brother or bank turned against you, neither of them, nor even both working together would have enough information to retreive the key.

Right, the miners reward will be halved, so the rate at which new coins are added to the supply will be reduced.  We're about 3 years away from the next halvening in 2020.  The second one was in July last year, and [didn't have much of an effect on price](

Suppose you use some coins to buy something mail order. The seller now has a name and address associated with your wallet address.
Say the change from that transaction goes to a new address. Say later coins are sent from there to a addresses A and B.
Say later still coins are used from address B to do another order from the original mail order place to you.
That seller now has good reason to believe that the same person who sent you stuff from him, also did the transaction to send the coins to A.
Every transaction leaves more crumbs. Add more crumbs from ISP logs, internet cafe video, and lots of other sources, and soon a clear picture emerges.
But feel free to ignore or disbelieve me. If you want to imagine that a blockchain can be simultaneously transparent and anonymous, go for it.

It's frustrating, but it's not Bitcoin.  Everything you've said comes into play when you start dealing with Sterling (or most other fiat currencies).  
When you start dealing with Sterling etc, then you're dealing with "money".  Dealing with money is a very licensed, regulated business.  Banks, crypto exchanges, stock brokers, credit unions, and all of those sorts of folks have to abide by Anti Money Laundering regulations which means sending in photo ID, proof of address etc, etc, etc.
Or is that not the "hassle" you are referring to?
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:47:29
I'm not arguing.  I agree that where your "good" coins are protected from replay attacks, it's a good idea to dump the "bad" coin as early as you are sure that's what you want to do.
On the other hand, without relay protection, any transaction you make on either chain can be replayed on the other chain.  That changes things.
Send all your "bad" coins to some altswapping service, and someone else can send your "good" ones there too.
Send all your "good" coins to a new address to split them from the "bad" coins.  Someone else can send your "bad" coins there too.
It's risky moving ANYTHING when there are two chains without replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:30:49
You really own your Bitcoin when you, and only you, have the private key for it.  That could be in a software wallet, a hardware wallet, or a paper wallet, even a memory wallet if you have that much faith in your grey cells.
While your coin is on an online service and you don't have the private key, you hold an account with a balance of 1 BTC.  The service owes you that coin in the same way as your bank owes you the money you have on deposit.
You are at risk of that service going out of business in the morning, or being hacked, or whatever.  In which case, you are at best just another creditor in the queue looking for your coin.
Of course, once you (and only you) have the private key, then it's up to you to keep it safe.
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:32:03
I do get your point, and while I think your heart is in the right place, your efforts a little misguided.
The ball you are getting rolling is the one that educates retailers that if they stick a "Bitcoin accepted here" sticker on their window, and provide a tool to convert Bitcoin to local fiat, that they are now "in" and they accept Bitcoin, when they are really just accepting local fiat.  I think that is a message that will take years to correct.
Actually trading in multiple currencies (whether or not one of them is Bitcoin) is an expensive, risky business for retailers, expecting every pizza place and coffee shop to do it is looking in the wrong place for the value of bitcoin.
For me, the big value of Bitcoin is in its value as a store of wealth.  Sure, that's risky too, but it's a lot easier and cheaper to move large volumes of Bitcoin around the world than it is to move gold, dollars or anything else - at least for us plebs at the retail end of banking.

This is my personal peeve.  It's not easy enough to answer that question.  You can go to [this site]( and move your mouse over to the right of the top chart.

I couldn't agree more with your live and let live philosophy.  I've pointed out more than once that while Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash might represent a disagreement around the right way to progress, I fully recognise that both coins are ultimately on the same side of a bigger disagreement.
This is why what I see saddens me, and I wish it wasn't happening.
The assessment that everyone jumped ship the last time BCH had a difficulty change is slightly over the top, I think that there was just one occasion when just over 50% of the hashing power moved briefly to BCH.  I get the benefits of stability for both chains, and I get why the BCH miner(s) who prevent EDA activiation by mining unprofitably is doing it.  They know that the mining bonanzas, inflation and accelerated halvening are not in the interests of BCH.  I also get that an artificially flooded mempool is not in the interests of Bitcoin users, who face into a period of slower, more expensive transactions deliberately triggered by some actor.  That's not great for the Bitcoin users we are supposed to be serving.
But, as I say, that's just how I read it.  If my narrative is indeed "all wrong", I'd be delighted to hear the correct one.

Bitcoin transactions cannot.
Anyone selling you bitcoin for paypal is taking the risk that you might stiff them by reversing your payment.

What you believe is a matter for yourself.  The fact is I was the one who raised the point about reddit history being a source of personal information.  It's not exactly hidden information.
Everything you say about encryption and 2fa and all of that is solid stuff, and I've said the same in the past to others.  
If I was triggered here, and I may have been, it was because of two things.
1.  This is a Good News story for Bitcoin, but it might give the wrong impression to a future visitor to Europe who might end up having a completely different experience in a completely different European country where, for example, the LocalBitcoins ecosystems is not as well developed, or where trading there gets you unwanted attention from the law or from scammers, or whatever.
2.  The "Don't mention the country" response to this question in this post is somewhat atypical of the general tone on this channel where people frequently namecheck a country when asking for help on exchanges, or currency conversion or whatever.  Or in other cases, people casually mention ISP's or cellphone providers, or other service providers, that identify what country they are in.

As of now, the last block was 12 minutes ago, which I guess was the one you were waiting for, and it took over an hour.  The one before that was took 2 minutes.  The one before that took 26 minutes.

Assuming the US could turn off the internet, which it can't, cryptocurrencies would not be the only casualty. The rest of the fincial world would also come to halt. Other casualties would be infrastructure like power grids, transport, telecoms, health care, policing; commerce as we know it would stop; banks would face massive runs; there would be massive sudden job losses; civil disorder, looting and riots.
Not pretty.

To start out, you need a safe place for your coins. Go to [bitaddress]( and follow the instructions to save the source and use it to generate a public/private key pair offline. Store the private key carefully.
Next, get an account on [bitstamp]( and transfer a euro balance to it via sepa.
When your euro land in bitstamp, you can buy bitcoin and then withdraw the bitcoin to the public address you created in the first step above.

I was fully aware of that, searching reddit histories is trivial and tooled.  That's why I asked about reusing reddit accounts, because it's a much richer source of information than simply namechecking the country you happen to be in at the moment.  And yet, we don't call it out.
Likewise, multiple threads on reddit casually name the current country, or namecheck service providers, retailers or currencies or something that equally identify the country.  Maybe even a photo of a "I paid for my burger with bitcoin" receipt, which not only identifies country it also calls out the city, the date and time, the restaurant, the order and maybe even the table number.  Still, I haven't seen it raised as a concern before.
That's why I was surprised at the dramatic concern expressed to my question, which could have turned OP's experience into something more usefully applicable to another traveller - as the experience in Germany would likely be different to the experience in the UK, or Portugal, or Greece or wherever.  This could set someone up for a nasty fall - including the commenter in this thread who thought that Europe was a country.

Sure, there are "penny stocks" in the crypto world, and they can swing wildly.  But with low liquidity, it could be hard to sell them when you think it's time to get out.
Even the bigger coins are very speculative.  Bitcoin almost hit $5k on Saturday, but here we are on Monday and it's in the vicinity of $4.25k.  Six months ago, it was about $1k.
I'm in no position to offer investment advice.  You might well be able to look back on Friday and see that some coins are double what they are today.  Trying to spot which ones before it happens is a lot harder.

Absolute scam.
It says it's registered in the UK, but the "check certificate" link, just links to the Company Registrations Office search page.  No company details.
The website doesn't list a company registration number, or even a company name.
The online chat couldn't provide either of the above pieces of information.  Initially, they provided a random string, but unsurprisingly, it wasn't a real CRO number.
Again.  The chat support person was unable to tell me the name of the company.
There is no company registered under the name of lucentcoin or lucentcoin.com.  
The site was only registered in August, with details of the domain owner hidden.

Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash share a pool of miners. Every so often, Bitcoin Cash makes itself more miner-friendly so a few of the miners work on their chain for a while. This is due to flip back tomorrow.

Because using bigger blocks as the primary method for scaling keeps more transactions on chain, and so increases miner revenue.
But mostly because if they win the BTC tag, they will oust the team which has brought BTC to where it is today, and give themselves greater power in setting the future direction of BTC - with miner-friendly developers and closed-door strategy meetings where the selected few make the decisions they will require the rest of us to live by.

There is no replay protection for the vast majority of transactions, because Jeff's fudge is designed to ensure that there isn't.
His original fork didn't even have this fudge.  Replay protection was not a perceived requirement for splitcoin. The fudge is an act of desperation to try to appear responsible.
This whole split is nothing more than a 'Capture The Flag' move. An attempt to increase Bitmain's influence on the Bitcoin brand. They don't give a curse about users. They care about protecting ASIC miner revenue. They tried convincing users to use BCH. That was an abject failure. 1 BTC is now worth about 12 BCH. So this time they are bypassing the need to convince any users, and opting for a hostile 'attack' (their words).
The whole thing, and not just the magic dust address palaver, is horseshit.

As you say, there are issues with trusting the issuer, but also the expense of the system.
Who would pay the issuer for printing and circulating all of these notes/envelopes? Not just the 100k's, but the fifties, twenties and tens you would need for change?
How about the disposal?  Presumably, if you were accepting a 100k satoshi piece of paper as payment, you would like to be able to sweep it into your wallet (a) to make sure that it really has the 100K and (b) to ensure that there aren't a hundred copies of this note flying around, with the first one to sweep it getting the goods.  So that's going to be a lot of envelopes getting binned after one use.
and there are tons of logistical issues around getting these notes into circulation, insuring them while in transit, etc etc

What's your perspective here?
If you bought Bitcoin as a long-term investment, then close your price screens, take a walk, and check back in  in a month or two.
If you're in this to make quick profits on short-term trading, which the reference to colored candles makes look more likely, then maybe you need to be more ruthless, and look to cutting your losses, and planning your next move.  Or if you don't have the stomach to take the fact that not every bet is a winning bet, maybe the trader's life is not for you.

OK, let me try again, with a little more detail.
Suppose you get paid on the 1st and you decide to buy something for $100 on the 15th.
By making that buy decision *at all* you are saying that "I would rather have this thing now than the future value that I would get from $100 worth of Bitcoin".  Instant gratification vs future reward. 
 That's fine.  It's your decision.  You will decide what is right for you.
The point is that this decision shouldn't depend on whether the $100 comes from a dollar balance or a Bitcoin balance.  In both cases, you are deciding to have a thing instead of however many Bitcoin equates to $100.  Instead of buying the thing, you could either keep or put the $100 into Bitcoin.
Had you put all of your income into Bitcoin as soon as you received it (or even better, been paid in Bitcoin to begin with), then even if you do cash out $100 worth of Bitcoin on the 15th to buy the thing, you would have gained value from the appreciation on that Bitcoin from the 1st to the 15th of the month.  By deciding to leave it in dollars in your checking account until you got around to spending it, you are deciding not to take advantage of that appreciation.
(Note that all of this is based on the same premise as your original question,  that "Bitcoin is increasing in value".)
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:14:25
Not really, because then you have to use plurals.  "They *have* Bitcoin", not "They *has* Bitcoin".  It's a frequently used form to work around the point that I made.  English lacks a gender neutral third person *singular* accusative personal pronoun.

You're moving the goalposts yet again, but no matter, I can move too.
Again the original theme of your post was around anonymity.  And I've demonstrated how your anonymity can be compromised by following the block chain and having access to some additional information about some individual transactions.
This can establish probabilities that a person associated with one transaction was also the person behind another transaction.  That could be plenty for someone to go seeking additional information through alternate means - in the case of law enforcement, this might include search warrants, seizure of computing equipment etc etc.  Depending on your jurisdiction, the level of proof ultimately required to secure a conviction will vary, just as the degree of autonomy of the judiciary will.  But even in countries like the US, EU or UK "beyond a shadow of a doubt" is not the required standard of proof, the lower "beyond reasonable doubt" is.  Again, depending on jurisdiction, any unwillingness to divulge keys or passwords, might be held against you, or might even be a crime in itself.
And that's just considering the judicial actors.  Those acting on the other side of the law might have considerably fewer impediments to physically forcing further information from you once they have established enough information to think that you might be their man.
The question of how many bitcoin an individual owns is a new addition to the conversation.  That's a whole different subject to whether spending any coins you own is anonymous, or whether you need to take additional precautions.
On this latter, original question, it seems you now agree with me.  Bitcoin is a public ledger, but it is pseudonmymous.  Put the blockchain together with some other sources of information and you can start piecing together more and more information about the identity of someone involved in a transaction.  
This is why additional precautions such as VPN's, address hygiene, coin tumbling, or even swapping between different cryptos, can all be very useful in protecting yourself.
Any incarnation of mimblewimble that we are to see soon will most likely be on a sidechain, not on Bitcoin itself.  So, yet again, it will be something you can do to protect your anonymity, but it will not make Bitcoin itself anonymous.

For major crypto currencies, you just set your self up on a relevant exchange and you are ready to go.
For some of the smaller ones, there may not be as much liquidity.  That is, the market volume is so small, that you could be left waiting for some time to find a buyer.
But I'm more of a holder than a trader, so I'm really not the guy to ask.  Maybe you could try @_date: 2017-09-06 20:00:20
Very welcome.
It all depends on where you are starting from.  
Before you can withdraw cash, pretty much every exchange will need to comply with "Know Your Customer"/"Anti Money Laundering" regulations, that means scanning documents and photo ID and bills or whatever for them to review.  That process can take from days to weeks these days, from what I hear.  Others may have better more recent experience to share.
You already have coins, so maybe you already have an account on an exchange someplace?  If so, that might get you a shortcut through the above.
If you have an account on an exchange that doesn't deal in BCH, you can use services like shapeshift.io or changenelly to convert your BCH to Bitcoin or whatever crypto your existing account uses.
If none of the above looks good for you, you could try finding a local person who will pay you cash for your coin.  localbitcoins.com is your friend here.  Tread carefully here, if you need cash quick, take some sensible precautions to ensure you don't get mugged.
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:52:07
Unless you have the private key of the wallet that your coins were in at the moment of the split, you can't claim the BCH.

Replay protection can impede adoption.  Lack of replay protection allows them to try to "own" Bitcoin by becoming the main processing engine.  After that, they get to go back into their meeting room and decide what to do with it. Anything that gets in the way of that plan is secondary.  Users funds not protected?  That's merely collateral damage.

If you do, and if it does, then indeed you make your money.  But depending on how long that takes, how patient you are, and how easily spooked you are, you might.
If you bought at the peak in 2013, you would have had a four year wait to break even. 
If you bought at the ~ $5k peak a few weeks ago, there's no way of knowing when/if you'll get your chance to make your profit.


Indeed you could have... but these things are more easily seen in the rear view mirror.  With the flood of transactions that hit the market around the time of the latest ZOMG CHINA, you could have been paying high fees and still waiting quite a while to get any trade done.  Sure, you could improve your chances by keeping your coins on an exchange ready to sell, but then you're at higher risk of  losing them all to a security event than if you kept them in offline storage.
People make money trading Bitcoin, others lose their shirts.  I suspect that there are many more of the latter than of the former.  Pretending that it's easy and infallible is just silly.

@_date: 2017-10-02 15:25:27
Ok, so if you admit it was a different scenario then your attempt say they were alike was a bit silly.
Any user who does a transaction on either chain (they may not even know which chain they are doing it on), is at risk of someone replaying that transaction on the other chain.  All because the 2x crowd don't want to put in replay protection.  I'm sure that there are terms in psychology for people who simply don't care about the consequences that their actions have on others.
And expecting people to just "wait" is a  stunning copout.  How do you plan on making sure that every Bitcoin user gets the messages to "Stop using Bitcoin now it's too dangerous!" and "It's ok, you can start again"?  And what if it takes longer than you expect for one or other of the chains to die off?  Or is all of that just acceptable collateral damage?

Still ducking... 
Most users don't run a client node.  They run something like Mycellium or Electron or Armory or Xapo or whatever... are the 2x crowd doing the civil thing and holding off until users of wallet apps can choose which chain they want to send a particular transaction to?  Nope.
And let's say everyone overnight started running core client and btc1 just to suit the 2x crowd, would running those two clients protect them from transactions being replayed on the other chain?
Nope, again.
Because this fork isn't about users. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:42:20
This tone that you adopt does you less credit than other emails.
If you want to see real replay protection, see BCH.  A hard fork, a new coin, and no way to replay transactions from one chain on the other.  If you want to trade on the new coin, you opt in to that new coin.  You get the right wallet, find the right exchange, whatever you need to do.  There is no way to accidentally transact on either chain if you intended to transact on the other one.
The "huge advantage" as you see it, is only a "huge advantage" to the proponents of S2X.  It is a huge disadvantage to everyone else.  It's a disadvantage to those of us who have to take extra artificial steps to steer clear of this new chain.  But it's an even bigger disadvantage to those who are unaware of the risks or unable to figure out how to do the magic that will keep S2X away from their transactions.  It's a bit like sticking up a post in some chat board saying "if you don't want us to leave a duplicate set of keys in your car door after Monday, write 'oionvh948y43bkvs09duf3' and the current date on a post it and leave it on your dashboard".  It's not taking users and their property seriously.


I meant "real".  I meant a scheme that would actually protect users and their coins.  You call the current kludge "opt-in", when it's anything but.  It assumes you want to transact on the s2x chain, unless you specifically opt out.
And, again, all of this only makes sense if the intention is to capture the Bitcoin flag.  None of it would be necessary if S2X launched their own coin.  But then users would have to choose to use that new coin.  As Wu et al learned from Bitcoin Cash, by and large people prefer Bitcoin.  So the play now is to capture Bitcoin.


Maybe we just leave it there then.

Talk to them, give them a choice.  Let them express their preference through the node they run, or give them a choice of wallets so that they can pick one that supports or rejects the proposed change.


yes.  I already corrected you on this.  I would rather that Segwit2x didn't deploy at all.  Then there's no hard fork, and no competition.  That's what I would *rather*.  But if the cartel is insisting on going ahead, then do another Bitcoin Cash.  Fork and give users a choice.

Sometimes It's not possible to give definitive answers.  
"Is now the right time to buy, or should I wait for it to fall a bit?" - People can guess, but no-one knows.  The more this question gets asked, the less patient people become giving the same answer.
"Should I invest $1000 now?" - We have next to no information about you and your financial situation, and even if you filled out a full assessment, we're not professional financial advisers.
"I think Bitcoin will go to zero, prove me wrong" - um why?  You have your opinion, good for you.  See above about predicting future.
What I have seen answered here is questions like "How do I...", "Why does...", "What has happened my transaction...", "What is the best wallet"... and so on.

How can segwit2x proponents ensure either of these is true?  If they can't isn't it a little irresponsible not to protect users from the consequences of the fork, by including replay protection?


We haven't "found ourselves" in this situation.  We're not even in this situation yet.  We will only be put in this situation if the Segwit2x crowd insist on putting us there by denying users the protection of their coins.

Thing is people the higher price might never come and people have emotions. Say you buy at 4k and Bitcoin suddenly starts sliding. 3800, 3600, 3000, 2800.... do you cut your losses? Or do you assume it will eventually moon past 4k again? How long will you wait? 
If you cut your losses, will you sit it out on the sidelines and wait for a bull run? Or will you short to make some profit on the slide? What if your short is just as bad a move as your original buy, and Bitcoin starts rocketing as soon as you short?
Rinse. Repeat.

A small self-selected group of people decided behind closed doors what was best for all of us, something they call "consensus".  They then set about implementing it in a way that would cause maximum damage to Bitcoin as we know it.  Rather than setting up a new coin, and convincing people to do it (easy if it's better, right?), they seek to fight for the name of Bitcoin, making things a lot dirtier.  The initial code made no attempt to protect user funds, although they have added a kludge that will be uncommunicated to and unknown to most Bitcoin users, so that many users' funds remain at risk.  I understand that criticisms of the method chosen have been removed from the discussion thread on the code repo.
But none of this matters to the important people who seek to control the future of the coin in their private meetings, because user risk, rushed code, and even the technical benefits that they seek to bring to the market are all secondary to the primary goal.  They want to own the future of Bitcoin.  Nothing else matters to them.

Because anything that gets in the way of them owning the name "Bitcoin" is expendable.
Jeff decided on some gawdawful impractical "replay protection" so that they could say "What do you mean there's no replay protection".
A lot of users won't be able to use this new thing because they won't know how to add a second payment address to their transaction.  Even if they did, would they know about the magic address that they need to throw some dust at to make S2X ignore their transaction?  And of course, the great galloping mass of transactions will continue to be made by users who don't know about S2X, don't know that their funds are at risk, and don't know that there's a magic step to take.
It means that, by default, any transaction can be replayed on both networks.  Send your bitcoin to someone, and Jeff will happily send them your S2X coins too.  Without your permission, approval or anything else.  Isn't there a name for people who actively assist in the commission of crimes like theft?
Jeff didn't want to implement real replay protection, because that would have effectively meant a new coin, and having to *convince* people to use that new coin.  They learned from BCH how well that worked out.
Jeff could have made his magic dust address dohickey work in reverse.  Unless you send some dust to this special address, S2Xchain will ignore your transaction.
Again, that's not a flyer, because he's not in the business of trying to convince anyone to use his coin.  He simply wants to take over Bitcoin.  All else is secondary.
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:00:40
Sharing data about home values is not the same as recording transactions on a shared ledger.  Just as different individuals can use the Bitcoin ledger to track coins moving from address to address.  Different individuals/companies can use other blockchain ledgers to track movement or state changes in other assets.
A key difference is that the network is trusted.  Instead of using miners, the network has rules that dictate who can verify different types of transactions.  POW is traded for trust.  But it's still a shared ledger, and a single version of the truth.  Compared to everyone inputting transactions into their own private databases and having people and process to validate and challenge updates from each other, it's much cheaper and faster.
And, depending on the implementation and use cases, it's possible to build smart contracts etc to add even more value.
I'm not exactly selling it.  But feel free to poke around and look at the Hyperledger site.  There's more info there.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:57:25
Thanks for not taking offense at my response.
I'm still lost, though.
To protect the company from the fluctuations of the £/$ and £/€ rates, you want to replace it with the fluctuations of BTC/$ and BTC/€ rates.  You appear to be basing that on the assumption that this will always work in the company's favour because the period since the Brexit vote has roughly coincided with a bull run in Bitcoin.    It might always work in the company's favour, but there's no real reason to believe that it will.
You're offsetting some of that risk onto the customers by having them exchange their sterling for Euro, and you're hoping to incentivise them for doing so with a discount of some sort.  
If that discount doesn't cover the cost of buying the BTC to pay the bill, your customers are paying more of the sterling they earn for their power, and the scheme starts to look less attractive for them.  If it does, the company is over.  If it does cover the cost, or even over compensates them, then the company would be better off billing in sterling and buying the Bitcoin itself.
It just seems to me that this scheme would take the existing sterling currency risks and replace them bitcoin currency while also adding extra points in the cash flow where that risk applies.
I don't think it's sustainable, especially where margins are tight, as a bear run on bitcoin sustained over a couple of months, could really hit hard.
But, that's just, like, my opinion, man.  And maybe you are onto something.  
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:04:50
You'd have to work out the probabilities on that 'potentially'. Demonstrate that a hostile takeover of Bitcoin can successfully be executed for that price and you've killed its potential to become a major piece of financial infrastructure.

1.  Import BCH into a wallet that supports it.  If you want something quick and easy, try BTC.com for a pure web client, if you can't be bothered installing anything.  Some caveats exist about any online wallet, but you have shown you're accepting of some risk.
2.  Exchange bitcoin cash for btc sent to a btc address.   You can do this simply using a service like shapeshift.io
As another approach, you could install coinomi ( you don't have android, but it runs on ios too), it can hold both BTC and BCH and has an inbuilt converter using shapeshift.
It's really not a lot of work, I think you should reconsider the decision to outsource it.

Probably not.
The price will reflect user adoption.  If users are given a choice and walk away from S2X, then the price and transaction count will be low, making BTC much more profitable to mine.
If users choose to go with the new coin, then the price will also rise to reflect that.  There will be more transactions, and the mining rewards and fees will be worth more as the number of on chain transactions and the value of S2X rises.
Ultimately, because S2X was launched as an attack on the Bitcoin chain, rather than a properly forked alt, only one of the coins is likely to survive.
I think that BTC will be the survivor.

Flipping your investment like that is a common thing to do.  It's just not a guaranteed winner.  The price doesn't move in long straight lines.  In the short term, it's a series of random up and down moves.  Selling now is the easy part, though you'd be doing well to get $4,000 right now.
Selling now is easy.  Getting back in at the right price is the hard part, because the right price is most easily seen with the benefit of hindsight.

For any of the use cases I've seen, they don't need or want random miners. Transactions are committed to the chain by active participants in the network, according to the rules of the network. 
The shared distributed ledger can revolutionise many areas of trade, which are currently recorded in multiple proprietary databases. Blockchain as a shared, immutable, trusted record of transactions could be a far more efficient approach.

In a perfectly neutral market, miners would mine the more profitable chain.  One of the defining characteristics of BCH is the easily triggered EDA.  Left to work as implemented, it would have led to periodic mining parties (see the wild swings after the fork), increased inflation of BCH and an early "halvening", all of which would have been damaging to BCH in the long term.  So, EDA is now avoided by a miner or miners motivated by something other than profitability, mining enough unprofitable blocks to prevent it from being triggered, thus saving BCH from EDA.

Of course it is.  You can't hope to advise every Bitcoin user, and you have no idea how long it will take either chain to die off.  
You can't contact every Bitcoin user.  Even if you could you couldn't advise them of how long it would take one or other of the chains to die, because you can't tell the future.
The only way you can protect users is through replay protection.
By refusing to implement that you are putting other people's money at risk, and stifling transactions for an unknown period, so that you can implement a new fork without having to take the risk of whether or not people would voluntarily use it.
And you don't even seem to understand how callous that approach is.

That article is pretty badly written, but it seems to predict a disaster for Bitcoin on the basis that 95% of miners start mining BCH instead because it's more profitable.
And that premise seems somewhat ungrounded when you look at the facts.
At the moment, when a miner mines a BCH block, they get a 12.5 BCH reward.  When they mine a BTC block, they get a 12.5 BTC reward.  With the market currently valuing BTC at almost 20 times the value of a BCH, it's a lot more profitable for miners to mine BTC.
The situation changes before much longer, when the halvenings come.  Because of the EDA, the BCH block count is thousands higher than the BTC one.  That means that the halvening will come to BCH much sooner that it comes to BTC.  When the halvening comes, mining a block will only earn you a reward of 6.25 BCH, while mining a BTC block will still earn you 12.5 BTC.  If each BTC is still worth close to 20 BCH, then the block reward for mining BTC will be almost 40 times the reward for mining BCH.
And that's before we even get onto the number of transactions in each block and the extra miner goodness that is in there with fees for each transaction.
The reason I'm not worried about the chain death spiral is that BTC is not the coin that will die.

There are arguments pro/con big blocks and segwit.  I intend to leave these aside for now because no matter where you stand on either of those, there is a bigger fundamental issue with 2X - its refusal to implement replay protection.
That's a problem because if I send you .01 BTC, I might also send you .01 B2X that I had no intention of sending you.  Or vice-versa.  It's up to the hard forker to implement replay protection.  They refused to.  
To say it won't be needed if it commands enough hash power on launch is simply a copout.  
Implement the protection, and we're all good, no matter where the hash power falls.  No need to depend on the assumptive "if's" in your justification.

Yes, you can. Which may or may not be good value depending on how much of Bitcoin's current value it holds post-fork - eg how much of its current value is borrowed from alt coins.

I would move your coins to offline storage asap.  Use a paper wallet.  Then, your coins will be safe.
With Segwit2x, you are denied a choice.  The self-appointed seek to make decisions on your behalf.  After a hard-fork, you will have coins on both chains, but with no replay protection, your coins are at risk if you attempt to do any transaction with them.
Say, for example, you decide to send your B2X coins to the wallet of some coinconverter because you want to convert them to BTC.  Anyone could send that same transaction to the BTC chain and your BTC would also be sent to that address.  Suddenly all your coins are gone. And you are at the mercy of the third party to give them back.
This risk is brought to you courtesy of the B2X team who don't want to be seen as a new coin, because they don't believe that users will adopt it.  So, they would rather attack BTC in the hope of "winning" the Bitcoin name - regardless of the cost to user funds.

When a country sets up its own cryptocurrency, it decides on the rules for that currency.  
One difference that they might want to insist on is a change from trustless to trusted.

If you've been sitting on them for years, the good news is that as well as your Bitcoins you've also got the same number of "Bitcoin Cash", which you can currently flog for somewhere around $600 a piece.
Here's two suggestions.
1.  Move your bitcoin from its existing cold storage wallet to a new one, just to keep it safe.
2.  Import BCH from the original cold storage wallet address into a wallet that supports it. If you want something quick and easy, try BTC.com for a pure web client, if you can't be bothered installing anything. Some caveats exist about any online wallet, but you have by now secured your real Bitcoin from this wallet.
3.  Sell some/all BCH on an exchange

The miners don't owe us anything, they're just the people we pay to mine our chain.
If the futures market is anything to go by, Bitcoin will be far more profitable to mine than B2X.  But if the big mining pools under the control or influence of Jihan Wu want to mine the less profitable chain for whatever objective, they may find miners leaving those pools to mine the more profitable chain.

You're not paranoid. There will undoubtedly be shady manipulation in the run up to and aftermath of the S2X fork. But it won't change the fact the the majority of the Bitcoin ecosystem doesn't want the new fork. The value will stay in BTC and miners will follow price.

I guess I was using the terminology loosely and treating cryptographic signatures as a form of encryption.
The overall point still stands, though.  If technology somehow changes so that the integrity of the cryptographic method in use can no longer be relied upon, a new method can be deployed.  And also, if the integrity of Bitcoin's cryptography is compromised, then likely the encryption of every other secure protocol on the internet is equally at risk.

Not Bitcoin, but certainly blockchain.
Bitcoin is trustless.  You don't need to know the other party.
Commercial research is into trusted systems. Networks of business partners who record transactions on a shared private blockchain. Instead of miners and POW, there are rules about who can add a transaction to the chain. Instead of a totally open blockchain, there are rules defining who can see what.

as I said, a hostile takeover.
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:09:21


Well no.  It's creating a new chain.  And it is allowing user's funds to be stolen from one chain if they spend them on the other.  That's pretty contemptible, no matter what your intentions.


Convenience for speedy adoption is not an excuse for facilitating theft.


It's the responsibility of the fork to introduce the protection.


That's hardly simple for most users who don't have access or knowledge to set flags on the transactions their wallet clients generate.  The simplest way to avoid it is to implement replay protection on the new fork.  But as you say, this would make the hostile takeover (sorry, "upgrade") dependent on people actually wanting it.
Whether you think 2x is a great idea or a terrible idea, implementing it in a way which puts people's coins at risk of theft or accidental mis-spending is still abhorrent.

They would trust it because the rules are decided on and enforce by the participants, who are known to each other.  They are trading partners.
The incentives vary by use case, but typically, speed, cost and transparency come into it.  It's a lot faster to update a transaction on a single decentralised database than to update it on multiple private databases with various reconciliation processes to resolve conflicting understanding of the current status.  
If I send you bitcoin, we can both watch the transaction on the blockchain and see the coins arrive at your address, and see the confirmations as they come in.  
Compare that to a more traditional route.  I use some banking interface to request my bank to transfer funds from my account to yours in another bank.  My bank verifies that I have the funds, and (possibly in a batch process later in the day) sends an instruction to some clearing house to transfer funds to your account at your bank.  That instruction gets sent to your banking system to transfer the funds to your account.  At some point the funds are credited to your account, possibly in some unconfirmed status for some time until the payment clears.  All I can see is that the funds have left my account.  Until they arrive in yours, you can't see anything. 
Similarly other transactions between participants in some trading network can be simplified, and accelerated through a shared blockchain.  
The benefits to business of dealing with each other on trusted blockchains are very real.  What I would say is that while I think that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, private blockchains are even younger.  So the future is wide open.

Samir's Secret Sharing is an algorithm that can convert your seed (or any string) into x different strings of which you only need y to retreive the whole seed.  You choose your values for x and y.
With a 3/5 set, you have 5 strings you can store in 5 secure locations.  If 2 of those locations are lost to earthquake or political or family turmoil, you can still get the other 3 and rebuild your seed.

This completely reputable cloud mining company hosts their server on a GoDaddy server which also hosts 23 other web sites.
The address on the domain registry looks to be a house in rural Sri Lanka.  The domain itself was registered on the 25th of September.
And what a coincidence... according to the IP's in this screenshot, our wholely reputable poster bringing this to the attention of the people of is also based in Sri Lanka.
This is one nimble company.  The domain name was registered on September 25th.  And as OP helpfully highlights, he was able to register his account there on the very same day.  That's some impressive turnaround there.  From domain registration to live service, to customers recruited, all within a matter of hours, if not minutes!
Assuming his mining rig was also up and running on September 25th, it was running for 6 whole days when he got a payout of .0012564 BTC.  That's a bit over .0002 BTC per day, which would mean that his free mining rig is running at roughly 1TH/second.
Almost seems too good to be true....

Too early to say.  As of now, there is no replay protection, so doing anything would be risky.  They're still working on code, though, so maybe clarity will come.
Just for clarity the current issue is in your step 2:


You would need to be certain that this will move your BTC and not B2X, which will depend on which chain the transaction gets processed on.  The transaction could then be replayed on the other chain (by accident, or malicously without your knowledge or consent).  In this case, your step 3 would fail because the B2X would no longer be in that address, they would be in the new address along with the BTC.

To be fair, that's about the most honest assessment I've heard from a Segwit2X supporter.  It's a hostile attempt to force users onto the fork chain.  The lack of replay protection is a deliberate tactic, and any user funds lost is merely collateral damage.

@_date: 2017-10-02 09:14:36
Late answer because I've only just seen your comment.
After the split, you will have the same number of B2X as you have BTC.  Suppose you want to send .01 BTC to your buddy Bob.  You send that transaction to the BTC network, and your .01 BTC gets sent to Bob.  But if your transaction also gets sent to the B2X network, you will also send Bob .01 B2X.  So you end up send more to Bob than you intended to.
Your BTC transaction could get sent to the B2X network either by accident or by a malicious actor, including Bob, if he so felt like it.
When BCH forked, it did the honourable thing and implemented replay protection.
B2X is acting out of pure malice by not implementing replay protection.

It's not a bad setup, but if you forget your container password, you've lost everything. Right?
I would suggest that you still need to give yourself the backup of a way to retreive your password.
One good option is Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm.
This will allow you to represent your password as a set of x strings, of which you need to have y to restore the password. You could choose to go 3/5. 5 strings, any three of which would be enough to reveal the password. 
Then store each string in a different location. If 2 location are completely destroyed, you can still regenerate your password. 
Not only does something like this protect you from forgetting the password, it could also be used to pass your coins on to family if something unexpected happens to you.

@_date: 2017-10-08 01:02:57
What? No.
It's the manner in which this is being implemented which is causing the replay risk.  If the forkers created their own coin with real-world replay protection, like say Bitcoin Cash did, then there would be no (or at least far less) animosity.  But this is a direct attack on Bitcoin itself.  An attempt by a special interest group to seize control and set the direction, without consultation with the development team or those of us who use Bitcoin.
In the absence of real replay protection, then we have lots of Bitcoin users who will never get the memo on the voodoo they have to do to opt out of having their coins stolen, or opt out of transacting on this new alt chain.  And those users are at risk of not just a devaluation of their coins, but of a disappearance of their coins.
That's what some of us are hoping to prevent.
Kiss and make up won't stop the risk to people's savings.

You have some amount of Bitcoin, let's say you have x BTC.   When the fork happens, you will still have x BTC and you will also have x B2X. The market will decide how much each of these is worth. 
1 post-fork BTC might be worth 1.1 times as many dollars as pre-fork BTC, or 0.75 times, or 0.25 times, or 0. The same for B2X.
The value will change over time.  Right now, on the futures market, post-fork BTC is about 75% and B2X 25% of a prefork BTC.

Because its main goal is to seize the Bitcoin name and ticker, and give them to a cartel of a handful of players who are frustrated that Bitcoin is not changing to their tune.
Because this cartel is tiny and mainly represents Bitmain, a company which operates mining pools, owns companies which operate other mining pools,  is one of the main manufacturers of mining equipment sold to miners.
Because it is being imposed as a contentious fork which places at risk the tens of billions of dollars of users money that is stored in Bitcoin.
Because it is being imposed in a covert way, with s2x nodes hiding their identity, in a manner described in the s2x mailing list as an attack.
Because increasing the block size indefinitely is not the solution to scaling and off chain transactions are necessary, ans keeping as many transactions as possible on chain no matter what is in the interest of miners.

What is not real about it as explained multiple times already is that the number of users in a position to act on it is a tiny percentage of active followers of the tech communities.  Most users will be unaware of the risk, will be unaware of the kludge, will be unable to add a second address to their transaction or will know what the magic address is.  As such this claimed "reply protection" will not protect most users' funds from replay attacks.


I trust that you are honestly reflecting your own opinion here.  I just don't believe that this is anything other than I have described.  Everything about the way in which this was decided and managed to date screams that this is about handing control of Bitcoin to a select few.

Key pairs are an algorithmic function.  This site contains a script which can run that function across all possible inputs.
You'll notice that there are 904,625,697,166,532,776,746,648,320,380,374,280,100,293,470,930,272,690,489,102,837,043,110,636,675 pages of results.
That's around 9.046 * 10^29 pages of results.  There are 128 results per page, so let's call that 1.16 * 10^32 key sets.
1.16 * 10^32
To put that into context:
The estimated age of the universe in seconds is about 4.32 × 10^17
So if you started cracking numbers at the very dawn of the universe,  generating a (US) billion key sets every second, you would now have about 4.32 × 10^26 sets of keys generated, or about .0004% of all possible sets of keys.
Look at it another way.  If you wanted to store all of these keys for easy lookup.  That's 121 bytes per key set, or 1.5 * 10^34 bytes you would need to hold the information.  Put another way, that's about 1.5 * 10^22 terabytes.  If you had some super-dense data storage mechanism that could store 500 TB per square inch that would be about 3 * 10^19 square inches of storage space you need.  The total surface of the earth is less than 8 10^17 square inches.  So, if you could harness every square inch of the surface of the planet (land and water), and squeeze 500 TB of data into every square inch, you might be able to hold something like 3% of all possible combinations, making the chances of having a combination that contains any actual value, as close to zero as makes no scientific difference.

Hey there.
I'm no whippersnapper, but I was having trouble understanding the concern that's on your mind.
If I got anything close to the sense of it, it's that person to person transactions allow us to charge for things that a bank would not allow. And so we could try to monetise everyday interactions.
I don't see this is necessarily new. People have been paying for or trading for various personal interactions since time began. But maybe most of us haven't or aren't about to start now.
Then again, maybe I missed the whole point. :)

Fair enough.  But that's exactly what is being attempted.  If the S2X proponents hid a hard fork, with actual, real replay protection, and set up their own coin, I would have no objections.
They could have done that, but they chose not to, because that would have meant they lost the "Bitcoin" flag.  And they want that, so they have to capture it.  It's the only reason for not doing this fork the same was as Bitcoin Cash did.


It means keeping as many transactions as possible on chain, where it will have to be mined by a Bitmain company or another miner probably using hardware bought from Bitmain.  It means setting future development priorities in an equally Bitmain-friendly manner.  It means deciding Bitcoin strategy in a closed room meeting between Bitmain and its miner customers.


Repeating a falsehood doesn't make it true.  The Bitmain-centric agenda means stalling and crippling on advances to Bitcoin that could see some transactions happen off chain between consulting participants.  These are obviously in user the user interest as they can settle faster and cheaper than even a 10-minute large block but it would mean losing the miner monopoly on transaction processing which is not in their interests.  This would add value to the coin, but reduce the miner fees, so they would earn less.  A smaller slice of a bigger cake might be bigger than all of a small cake, but it might not.
But my objections are not just technical, as you can see.  Insulating Bitcoin from an ever-growing influence of a small cartel is important if Bitcoin is to have any future.  Closed room deals between the "important" people, is not the way for Bitcoin to evolve.  Forcing changes onto users in a way that puts their funds at risk is not the way for that evolution to happen.

What will happen remains to be seen, unfortunately. 
They have not implemented replay protection so, while there are two chains, transactions on one will/can also happen on the other.  This isn't a sustainable situation for any length of time.  So, if one coin doesn't implode completely, someone's going to have to implement replay protection if both are to survive.
Then again, maybe S2X proponents will recognise the situation before it's too late and call off this whole thing.

Bitcoin, and cryptos generally, are not there to fill a desire to want your transactions public. They are there to allow you to make a transaction with a party you may not know or trust without relying on one or more mutually trusted third parties in the middle. The public nature of the ledger is how that is achieved.
As an example use case, think of wikileaks. When wiki pissed off the wrong people, credit cards stopped processing donations to their account. There is no-one who can stop you or me sending them bitcoin.
And while the transactions from one account to another are public, the ownership of those addresses and the reasons for the payments are not public. And with the absence of a trusted third party, there is no-one to lean on to spill the beans.  Compare this to a banking or credit card transaction, where the identities of both parties are known and can be revealed through legal process or hacking. With something like paypal, the invoice can also be obtained.

It seems a waste talking to you when you seem to ignore what I say, and just tell me what you wish I would say, but I'll indulge you one more time.
In the case of S2X, this was a change which does not have user support, which is described by proponents on their mailing list as an attack, and which actively seeks to replace the development team with a guy who is still tinkering with code weeks before launching it onto billions of user funds.  In a case like THAT, I think the whole project should be called off, but if they insist on going ahead, then I think it would show an enormous disrespect to user funds to go ahead without relay protection.
Should there be an actual upgrade proposed in the future, I am open to discussing how that should proceed.

It's got a number of serious issues. 
Its 'wow' feature is that in allows blocks to swell to 8mb. This is something of an irrelevance as their blocks are currently in the order of tens of kb.
Some feel that it was more than coincidence that blocksize became an issue for Bitcoin in the runup to the fork. Suddenly Bitcoin was asked to process a glut of large (data volume, not value) transactions. This meant that there was a backlog of transactions to process and a bidding war started with people paying higher fees to get faster confirmations. The backlog has cleared now, and transactions are confirming quickly with low fees.
Because it has a lower value than bitcoin and needs the same miners, Bitcoin cash was giving away more of their coins to attract miners, using a built-in difficulty adjustment, the other defining feature of bitcoin cash. This was unsustainable, so now one miner games the system by mining just enough blocks to keep the emergency, and other miners, away. This miner now has an effective monopoly on the coin as it is willing to mine it even though it is less profitable than mining bitcoin. Altruism, or some vested interest?
Some light may be cast on this by Asicboost. There is a known issue with bitcoin cash which can be used by some miners to mine faster than others. The exploit to take advantage of this has been patented, and bitcoin cash leaves itself open to this vulnerability.
With slow adoption of the gamed coin, it's hard for me to see how it will hold its current value of about 0.125 BTC unless something major changes. With no dev team, that seems unlikely.
This is why I ditched mine.

We haven't been discussing the merits of the two chains.  We have been debating the fact that the new chain will be launched without replay protection, thereby putting users funds at risk, and your belief that it's ok to fork under these circumstances.


I've no idea what you meant.  You offered "our money" as a correction to my reference to "other people's money".  We own our own Bitcoin, and the proponents of segwit2x are putting not just their own, but other people's money at risk.


Which is why it is best described as a hostile takeover.


I never said you could.  I can send a coin from address A to address B on one chain.  Anyone else can replay that transaction on the other chain so that a coin from the other chain is also sent to address B.  So whichever chain I send from, the same amount can be taken from the other chain.  If I want to send you one Segwit2X coin, you can also take one Bitcoin.  And this is the risk that S2X is happy to expose everyone to, just because they want the BTC ticker.
Contrary to your perspective, this mess doesn't avoid confusion, it adds to and prolongs it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:11:13
For me, it depends on a few things.
If you're selling a phyisical item that will be shipped to my home address, or if you require me to register with my name and address, then accepting bitcoin is nice, but a bit meh.
On the other hand, if you're selling something I can download or a service I can use, and you don't ask for personal info, and you accept bitcoin, that can be very attractive.
For example, if you're selling a VPN service, and I can subscribe without telling you who I am, just paying with Bitcoin. That's attractive.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:11:23
I think there may well be a time for bigger blocks, but it's not now.

I am assuming that there is no protection for users on either chain, which is true because of the lack of replay protection.
I am assuming it is hostile because denying users this protection is a deliberate decision.  And the only reason for this denial of user protection is that the proponents of the chain don't want to be seen as an altcoin, as that would force them to convince enough of the bitcoin community to adopt the forked coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:27:56

You miss the point.
Why leave any cash in your account when that cash could buy Bitcoin and increase in value?
Your original question is based on only half a premise.
If you buy 'stuff' worth $100 using Bitcoin, then you are 'losing' the future value of the Bitcoin you spend.
On the other hand, if you keep $100 in cash and don't convert it to Bitcoin, then you are 'losing' the future value of the Bitcoin you decide not to buy.
So, in both cases the opportunity cost is roughly the same but that depends on how long you hold the cash balance for.

This is where we disconnect, I think.  Or maybe I misunderstand what you mean by 


So let's say I'm a UK Energy company.  What does it mean if I "adopt bitcoin".  I bill my customers in bitcoin, pay my suppliers in bitcoin, pay bitcoin dividends to my shareholders, and hold a bitcoin balance in reserve.  Is that what you had in mind?
Because if that's it, then I don't see the magic.  
No company is an island.  At least the vast majority of my suppliers  are going to be trading in fiat. So I'll have to sell my Bitcoin to pay them.  If Bitcoin is appreciating in value then it's a good deal for me.  If I pay my shareholders in Bitcoin, they're going to convert it to sterling.  Again, a rising Bitcoin value is good news for them.  Ditto my employees.
The only people hurt by the pound falling against sterling are my customers who get paid in sterling.  Month by month their 0.1 (or whatever) BTC bill is going to cost them more and more of the sterling they earn to pay. 
Not sure why they'd want to hang around for that.  
Of course if Bitcoin plummeted against the pound, the swings and roundabouts would reverse.
So you've taken a system that operates primarily in sterling, and changed it to add in an exchange risk for all your customers, employees, suppliers and shareholders.
Seems to me that my competitor down the road who continues to deal in sterling would look a lot more attractive to all of the above.
But maybe I'm missing your point completely?

Well, BCH is currently trading at about 1/12th of a BTC, dropping a lot in the past week or two.  I would suspect that this is below many people's aspirations.


Uniting users is pretty hard.  The default state is that actions can be replayed on both channels.  For many Bitcoin users who don't keep actively informed, they're not necessarily going to know that there are two chains, or which one their wallet software is going to route the transaction to, or how to add a second address to their transactions, or what that address should be in order to keep their transaction off the S2X chain.... I suspect that many of them may not even have heard of S2X, or if they have they are just working on the assumption that they can just keep transacting as normal and it will all work itself out somehow.
What we have got, so far, is market value.  If Bitcoin stays valued much more than S2X, then that gives a reason for more hashpower to work the Bitcoin chain, and the usurper will fall away.  Reverse those valuations, and Bitcoin is in trouble.  If they come close to parity, then the hashpower may spread more evenly until the next EDA cycle takes a chunk of it away for a while.
The S2X protagonists have deep pockets to fight on the valuation front.

That DA doesn't meet the basic premise, though.
If I'm recouping the cost of the hardware faster by renting it out than by mining, the I must be charging you more in rent than the hardware will generate from mining.  This the opposite of the proposition being offered to the customer:

You just need to take a break and then have a think.  Has your justification for buying into Bitcoin been changed since?  If it has, then you might want to consider whether you want to hodl.  If they haven't, then you should be good to hodl or even top up.
If you fancy a bit of risk, you could try your hand at timing the dips.  Sell some or all of your coin and hope to buy more for less later.  Get it right and you could increase your hodlings.  Get it wrong and you could reduce your hodlings.

And that's what I don't recognise.  I can't think of an occasion when shareholders, stock market traders are put down here.  In fact the most common advice you will get here is that Bitcoin is a highly speculative punt, and that you shouldn't over commit to it, and that your investment portfolio shouldn't be very skewed to crypto.
I'm struggling to think of what you might be referring to.  I guess there are occasional swipes at commentators from big banking when they say crypto is a bubble or something like that.  Crypto day-traders probably get a but of stick too, but that's not stock traders.

You have to invest a lot of money up front for specialist hardware and be able to deal with big running costs. It scales up well, but getting your foot in the door is expensive. It's also risky. If the ass falls out of crypto for good tomorrow, I can sell my coins. A miner can... try to sell hardware as a noisy space heater?
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:28:14
And BCH didn't quite go to plan. Sure, it's ocassionally a cash cow in the short term, thanks to the EDA, but it's not sustainable. The inflation is hurtling BCH to an early halvening. At that point, with precious little in transactions, they would need to mine a new block every few seconds for it to be as profitable as Bitcoin.
So BCH was a failure. They didn't win people over.
S2X is plan B. Replace Bitcoin *without* having to win people over, by staging a takeover of Bitcoin itself. Once again, using miner friendly big blocks as the motive. If they win, who knows how long off-chain transactions will be supported. If Bitmain owns Bitcoin development, it can ensure that Bitcoin's POW remains suitable for Bitmain's hardware, and they can ensure that as many Bitcoin transactions as possible pay a mining fee.

Bitcoin was not pre-mined. Anyone who was aware of it back in the day could have mined it from the get go.
Some alts are pre-mined, where the creators of the coin mine an initial number of coins before launch. These coins tend to be regarded with some suspicion.

There's a risk of antivirus programs picking up on some virus signatures in the block chain.  If that happens, your anti virus will tell you want to do.
There's a risk that someone who wants to attack BigFix might try to DDOS your IP address for a while.  The chance of this is low, but these days who knows, I guess.

You too, nice to be able to exchange differing opinions.  
I think the internet has matured nicely, but I suspect that we are doing things on the internet now that DARPA never imagined.  I also know that we lost a lot of other technologies along the way that became pretty much obsolete.
I think that at it's simplest level, we still have blockers to mass adoption.  Keeping bitcoin safe needs to be easier, calculating transaction fees needs to be easier, transaction times need to be more predictable.  I think we've also got an over-reliance on a handful of mining companies, which needs to be addressed.  At the other end of the technology, I think that there is more sophistication and functionality that can be layered onto Bitcoin, to enable more "stuff".
Bitcoin was the first blockchain application.  There are many others.  All working differently, all with different objectives.  Some of these will survive and become intrinsic to everyday life (but none of them really has yet) and others will wither and die.
I don't see the maturity there yet.  But that's opinions for ya.

Your judgement on when to transact on either chain is your own.  But it doesn't change my point that one does not merely ignore the "other" chain (whichever that is for you), you decide what to do with it.  
Replay attacks can hurt the unwary when they want to make a transaction on one chain, but not the other.

Well, you could ask them, if you need them to tell you what your opinion on it is.  The situation is clear.  With no replay protection, if I sign a transaction on one chain **anyone** can replay that transaction on other chain.  It's already signed by me, so they just have to copy it to the other chain.  If I send you 1 Segwit2X coin, you can help yourself to my Bitcoin, without my approval.  I'm one of those people who think that people taking money from others without their permission is wrong.

I'm just advising anyone who cares to take it in that moving your coins on either chain comes with the risk that anyone could replay the move on your coins on the other chain, without your consent. In that context, it's not necessessarly the best idea to rush into dumping coins asap.  
And that's not even looking into the risk of guessing which chain(s) survive.

Get it discussed among the developers first, anyone with a record of contributing to the code, and then when there's a consensus there, socialise it with the user community to see if we want it, how we want it, when we want it, etc..  from that consensus can dictate net steps.
If consensus can't be achieved, but proponents are still keen to go ahead, then hard-fork with replay protection and may the best coin (or both) flourish.

I dunno about Nepal, but much of the world's exchanges have KYC/AML regulations governing exchanges.  Buy your bitcoin online, and with difficulty that varies by jurisdiction, the state can find out who owns your address.
If you buy something with bitcoin, and it needs to be mailed to you, the online store has a link between the address that paid for the goods and where the goods went.  Again, that may be something the state can request.
Alternatively, maybe your trade is inadvertently with the state, in a sting or surveillance action. 
Maybe you use email or sms as your 2fa.  The state may be able to have a little snoop there.
And of course, the state may actually tamper with your equipment to install keyloggers, screengrabbers or other spyware.
Once the state knows a bunch of addresses you owned, it can start linking them and reviewing actions across the blockchain and start generating identifying you as a "person of interest".
There are umpteen ways, these are just off the top of my head.

I think that many EU governments will be less than enthusiastic about Bitcoin. The relationships between governments and banksters run pretty deep. 
What they can do remains to be seen. Exchanges in the EU are already subject to regulation because of the fiat they handle. Trading and mining is unlikely to be attacked. Maybe taxation will be more heavily imposed. 
But those same Banksters want in on blockchain. There is a lot of investment going into trusted ledger systems, smart contracts, and various other blockchain applications. A thriving crypto environment grows the talent and experience required to develop those systems. Cracking down on it would lose the EU some commercial opportunities.
Draghi's statement is really just telling the European Commission and Parliament that this is a matter for policy and legislation.

That depends.  Big companies who are motivated to win the war, possibly will.  But the big miner hashpower also includes small miners who just happen to be mining in one of the big miners pools.  
These may have less desire wage war and shallower pockets to wage a war of attrition, and could well shift their hash power to a pool that lets them mine at a profit.
I'm not relaxed about this.  It's a real threat.  I just think that that the market may already be on our side, and with S2X still fannying about with the code they want to deploy, it looks like they're not going to be ready anyway.

Say a retailer buys a thing from a Chinese manufacturer for 66 Yuan (about $10 today) on 60 days credit and puts it on sale for $20 (allowing $6 for his cost of sale and taxes plus $4 in profit).  If the dollar plunges against the Yen so that the 66 Yuan costs him $15, didn't he just lose money?  Shouldn't the US retailer sell his goods for Yuan?

Quite frankly, the s2x proponents don't care. They work on the assumption that transactions on the Bitcoin chain will never be mined, and so don't matter. By that logic, if you want to move coins from address A to address B, the only way do do it is on the s2x chain.  
On that basis, replaying s2x transactions on the bitcoin chain is of no concern to them. The chain will be stalled and the coin is worthless anyway. Conversely replaying your Bitcoin transaction on the s2x chain would be 'fixing' your transaction by moving it to the 'right' chain.
Of course this is just arrogant bollox and the rationale fails if the chains coexist for any length of time.
The S2X movers just don't care. They only care about seizing the name of Bitcoin. All else is secondary.

A blockchain records state changes in assets. Currency is one example. Others are tracking the history of diamonds , works of art, or a history of airplane maintenance.  Take the last example. Suppose airlines, aircraft manufacturers, servicing companies, parts suppliers, and regulatory inspection agencies all come together to define a blockchain ecosystem. We all agree rules on who can create and validate different transactions. Now we can have a shared database of the history of every aircraft, showing its ownership history, maintenance history... and if a bolt on plane 1564593 snaps when it shouldn't've, we can all see which planes have bolts from the same batch, and so on. Far, far cheaper and better than each company maintaining its own proprietary database with a subset of the facts.

The kludge was not part of the original s2x fork, and was only checked in after it became clear even to the s2x cartel that they had to have *something* they could pretend was replay protection.  The code was, as I said, forked without replay protection.
Second, your claim that Jeff couldn't have reversex his logic without a change to the real Bitcoin code is also wrong. Whether through ignorance or wilful misrepresentation, only you know. S2X now has the logic to recognise the magic dust address, and if detected, it will reject the transaction. It would have been just as possible to implement the opposite logic... only accept the transaction if the dust address is there.  No Bitcoin change required. It still wouldn't be real replay protection, but S2X has no interest in even this, because they don't want people to have to choose their new coin. They know that if people choose, they lose.

But you have repeatedly defined what you mean by anonymous.  I explained how if you buy something by mail order, your trading partner knows about you.  And they can also see the change address that associated with your payment transaction, so that they can watch what happens next.  If you buy from them again a few transactions later, they can make a reasonable assumption that the chain of addresses between the two purchases also belong to you.
I also pointed out that there are legal and illegal means to get information from people you trade with, which allows anyone with access to those means to supplement the public blockchain data with additional information.  I pointed out that the information thus gathered could call in additional sources of information whether through a search warrant or thugs arriving at your door or the door of someone you are connected to.
In response you asked how this could be used to definitively prove how much bitcoin someone owns.  I didn't say that it could, just that transacting on the blockchain is not in itself anonymous.
You then wondered about "proof beyond a shadow of a doubt", and while this not a standard usually required by the courts, the blockchain data coupled with data acquired from other sources could well secure a conviction.  
We agree that there are steps you can take to make it as difficult as possible (maybe even make it impossible) to uncover your identity but these additional steps are required precisely because Bitcoin is not anonymous.
We even agree that Bitcoin is pseudonymous, although it seems that we disagree a bit on what this means.  It is pseudonymous not just because exchanges are subject to KYC.  It is pseudonymous because additional sources of information can be pieced together with the information on the blockchain to reveal additional information.  That's what makes is pseudonymous.
Suppose you buy something from me using Bitcoin.  The coin goes from your address A to my address B and the change goes to a new address of yours, C.  
Suppose you later buy something from someone else.  The coin goes from your address, C to that someone else's address D and to your change address E.
Suppose that someone else then buys from me, and spends coin from their address D to my address F and his change address G.
In the above snippet, I can be confident that C is your address.  And since coins flowed from C to D to my address F, I can conclude that you have some relationship with that someone else who owns D under which you paid them in a transaction and how much that transaction was for.
That's a trivial contrived example, but it shows how, given the right circumstances, conclusions can be drawn with the help of the blockchain.  For bigger examples, you can imagine actors from various law enforcement agencies or criminal networks operating on the network giving them a chance to pool information with colleagues.  They may also be able to (legally or otherwise) seize information from other participants in the network to supplement their knowledge.
Do you run your own full node, or do you use a thin client (SPV) wallet?  If the latter do you know who owns the node(s) that it connects to?  Do you know whether your particular wallet reveals all of your addresses and your IP address to that node?  
You accept now that "mimblewimble is not bitcoin itself", it is a sidechain, but when you introduced mimblewimble into the conversation it was on the basis that it made the rest of our conversation moot because of its "giving bitcoin 100% privacy" within a year.  In fact, it just becomes one more extra thing you can do to make yourself anonymous when you use Bitcoin, but it doesn't make Bitcoin itself anonynous.
Going back to your original topic of "how many addresses with a significant amount of bitcoin have been identified?", I don't know the answer to that because not everyone who identifies the holder of a Bitcoin address is necessarily going to go public with that information.  But here's [one list]( of a lot of services and their known addresses.  I have absolutely no doubt that there are organisations and agencies building up their own list as well.
Bitcoin is not anonymous.
You and I both know that you have to take additional steps to stay anonymous (or as close to it as possible).  Anyone who assumes that they have anonymity simply by using Bitcoin had better have no real need for anonymity, or they are in for a nasty shock.

You answered a different question




Your answer


See how these are answers to different questions?
Here's a cheat sheet for you.
Canada printing more Canadian dollars has no effect on the supply of US dollars.
if writes "1 trillion USD" on a piece of paper, it does not change the supply of US dollars.
 
Returning to your original question.  The supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million.  This is not changed by the creation of a new alternative crypto currency.  In fact, there are already many hundreds (thousands?) of these [alternative currencies already](  These have not changed the supply of Bitcoin.
You could take a copy of the Bitcoin codebase and blockchain today and call it Lebocoin.  So far, you haven't achieved anything.  Without a working ecosystem where people can buy and sell Lebocoins, you have nothing more than some code.  Let's say you invested in a miner for your new coin.  Now you can send your Lebocoin from address A to address B.  Whoohoo.  You have a working coin.  But if you haven't changed anything, the same transaction could be replayed on the Bitcoin blockchain, with or without your consent.  So when you move Lebocoin from address A to address B, your Bitcoins also move from address A to address B.  You can't separate them.  
Without replay protection, there are three possible outcomes over time.  Lebocoin replaces Bitcoin (hard to see why that would happen since Lebocoin adds literally nothing new, and is starting from zero adoption).  Lebocoin dies off and its value becomes zero (the most likely outcome).  Or the market adopts Lebocoin as a new alt currency.  This last outcome is the least likely, as there is no reason for anyone to invest anything in supporting Lebocoin since it adds no improvement to the Bitcoin that it is a copy of, and the lack of replay protection would put people's Bitcoin at risk.

~~You should have.  Every day you wait, you get fewer BTC for them.~~
Oops misread that as thinking about switching... nevermind.


The value of BTC was divided between the new coins, so while you had 1 of each instead of just 1 BTC, the value of the BTC could have declined if the market thought that BCH was the right thing to do.  As it happened, the BCH fork activated during a  bull run, so BTC was increasing in value anyway.  Whether it would have increased more without BCH, we will never know.


BTC wants about 6 blocks per hour.  It doesn't stray far from that.


In the short term, it's survival.  If no-one mined BCH, it would die off.  The effect of EDA is that there oscillations of mining frenzies, and then mining droughts.  Overall, the effect is inflationary on BCH, as it has generated almost 4,000 more blocks so far.  Not only is this flooding more BCH onto the market, but it is also hastening the halvening, which will cut by 50% the miner reward (in BCH) for mining BCH blocks.  
The biggest threat right now to Bitcoin is the attempted hostile takeover by Segwit2x, which puts all our funds at risk by not introducing replay protection, and which is an attempt to centralise bitcoin decisionmaking in the hands of miners, as was done with BCH.

No.  If there's a public key, there's a private key.

Ideally, any BTC should be transferred out of these addresses before you retrieve the Private key over the web.
Once you get the relevant IP addresses, then you can use an app like coinomi to transfer the BCH directly to BTC

Which is sort of my point, they'd be getting back the currency they paid with, regardless of the fact that it had appreciated against some other currencies... but I guess I didn't make the case very well.
What you seem to be arguing for here is a way for merchants to be able to buy BTC instantly, on credit, without having to bother with exchanges and all that fuss.
Just ship out some crap in an ipad box, and take the BTC.  A few days later, when the angry customer comes back in, take back the box of crap, and pay whatever your system says is today's rate for the BTC you took from the customer.  With a selection of rates available on different exchanges, there is opportunity to pick the best rate for you.
All the risk falls on the customer.
I guess it's a bit like shipping costs. Some sellers refuse to make any contribution to shipping, refuse to invest in any sort of group negotiation to bring down shipping costs, and refuse to accept any responsibility for non-delivered packages.  After all, if I ordered an ipad, I could just keep saying it was never delivered until I received 6 of them.  Customers are untrustworthy scum, you're just protecting yourself.
On the other hand, other retailers provide free shipping, and promptly send out any items which customers say they didn't receive.  They get the repeat business and loyalty of customers, who (believe it or not) aren't looking to game the system.
I fail to see any advantage for the consumer in paying BTC for a dollar sale.

That's just not true.
Here's a couple of reasons, why running a retail store in bitcoin and local currency is always more difficult and more risky than running on just local currency.
1.  Maintaining dual pricing.  If someone is walking around the aisles in my store, knowing that he's going to pay in bitcoin, I should be displaying the price in bitcoin, confident that that is the price in bitcoin that the customer will be asked to actually pay at the till.  It's not easy to keep that price current - especially so for a currency as volatile as bitcoin currently is.  Of course, you can opt not to display dual pricing and just ask the customer to put stuff into his basket without knowing the actual price and tell him we'll figure it out at the till.
2.  Bitpay does a spot translation into fiat currency.  So, let's say, customer buys a $200 tablet and pays 0.3 BTC for the purchase, and the retailer gets the $200.  Now, suppose a day later the customer brings back the tablet cause it's rubbish and he wants a refund.  His 0.3 BTC might now be worth $300.  Does the store refund $200 or $300?  Either way, someone's going to be $100 down.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:23:17
It's a graphical representation of the public key.  You can extract the public key from it.  The alternative is to display the public key in text.

If you want to sell in a hurry, you need to get your BTC onto an exchange, so that you can execute a trade automagically or manually when your criteria are met.
Bear in mind that there are two risks with this.
1) There may be a single, steep drop in price, immediately recovered - a bear trap.  Sell your coins then, and you're sitting on the sidelines with your cash as the price recovers.
2) The exchanges are attracting a lot of black hat attention at the moment.  There's a lot of easily transferrable BTC sitting in them.  Leave you BTC there to facilitate a quick emergency sell, and yours may be the ones that get stolen.

Say I have 5 BTC.  Say, I want to buy a new phone listed at $500.
I could buy it for something in the region of 0.5 BTC.
Then I could go to the bank.  Transfer $500 to my exchange, and wait a few days for it to arrive.
If Bitcoin has appreciated in value in that time, my $500 might now only buy me 0.4 BTC.  So, I've got my phone, and my checking account is down the $500, but 0.1 BTC has also evaporated.
On the other hand, I could leave my 5 BTC alone, and buy the phone for $500.  I'm still down $500 and have my shiny new phone, but I also have 5 BTC and not 4.9 BTC.
I guess another alternative is to transfer an extra $500 into BTC *first*.  Then wait the few days for it to land in my account.  Then go to the phone shop and use it to buy the phone.  This way seems to just lose me a few days bonding with my new phone for no reason other than the principle of paying in bitcoin.

i think your answer is predicated on an assumption that BTC is a consumer concept only. Why should that be? Why doesn't the retailer negotiate some of his costs in BTC too? Actually get immersed in the BTC economy? Then there's no glaring need for the retailer to offload BTC, and everyone's happy.

The best way to buy bitcoin from an island nation on the western periphery of Europe is to register on an exchange.  It's not fast to get started, though.
I'd suggest you look at [bitstamp](  You can register an account there in minutes.  However, you won't be able to lodge funds until you have gone through the proof of ID rigmarole.  You have to scan in a photo ID and utility bill, referencing your name and address, which they then manually verify.  I have found that this process takes about 4-5 business days.
Once you've been through that hoop, you can then SEPA some funding to the account.  It takes about another 3 days or so, and ends up as dollars instead of Euro for reasons best known to BitStamp.
But once you've been through all of that, you then have funds on the sideline and can do market or limit orders as you see fit.  Should you wish to add more funds in the future, your ID is already sorted, so you just have the second lead time above.
Moving cash in and out of any of the online exchanges takes at least a few days.  
When you buy your coins, I would strongly urge you to save them in a private wallet rather than leaving them in your exchange account.  The downside of this is that it can cost you time to put them into your account when/if you decide to sell them again.  But the advantage is that you are protecting yourself from theft if the exchange gets broken into.  The exchanges do their best to prevent this, but they are a huge attractive target for breakins and it's an arms race out there.  Breakins happen.  Coins get stolen from exchanges.
For something faster, you might consider [localbitcoins]( but the speed tends to come at a high premium relative to market prices.

I'm just curious.  Your suggestion of "sell now" sounded more absolute than "sell a little now", but I'll leave that distinction as something to be pondered by anyone following the advice from you and your "technical analysis".


That's all I was trying to get a stab at.  You could wait forever for the price to retreat to $920, or you could wait an hour, or wait until tomorrow.  I was just wondering how long you were prepared to wait before you would take the hit, buy back in and hope for a better result on your next attempt.


I had thought about doing that as well.  In fact I had a few goes.  Some worked out well, some didn't.  Then I realised that, for my needs, holding was generating a pretty damn fine result and I didn't feel the need to try to layer on some daytrading on top.
If you're up for the challenge, go for it, and best of luck with it.

Nope not at all, currency speculation is a very big issue in stores which try to process multiple currencies.  Shifting all of that risk onto the customer isn't friendly, and wouldn't win my business.


Merchants who used services like bitpay didn't accept bitcoin and so didn't profit from the increase in value.  Those who did accept bit coin, did accept the risk, and did indeed do very well out of it assuming that (a) when/if they needed to convert it back to fiat to pay suppliers and (b) they had the processes in place to safely secure the bitcoins and weren't victims of any of the thefts of coins in online storage.  Risk means just that.  It doesn't mean you lose.

Rights will be dependant on jurisdiction, but here in the EU, if I paid you in BTC, my understanding is that I would entitled to a refund in BTC.
If the merchant maintains a BTC current account, then no-one loses out.
On the other hand, if the merchant only deals in Euro and has a third-party service provider who converts the customer's BTC to Euro before ringing up the sale, and the customer is made aware that the transaction is taking place in Euro, then a Euro refund would likely be the result - representing a loss for the customer, and possibly to the merchant in terms of no repeat business from the customer.

Well, you stated it.  I don't know that you actually made the argument in a very successful way, or anything.  Stating that people don't understand prefixes like kilo doesn't make it so.
Much of the world, is very happy to use SI prefixes.  We're quite comfortable with measurements such as kilometers and millimeters.  We buy kg's of butter.
We're also quite happy using decimal notation.
If you want to call 1/10,000,000 of a bitcoin a vzzbux, and say that there are 100 of those in a roobht, and 10 of those in a badoing, go right ahead.  You can then price some item you want to sell at a badoing plus 3 roobhts and 99 vzzbuxes.  Or use whatever rates and multipliers you like.  Go for it.
Me, I'll stick to the SI system which many many more of us are comfortable dealing with.

Bitcoin has a number of challenges to overcome:
* Acceptance - It's still not widely accepted.   Most merchants who "accept bitcoin" actually only accept fiat really
* Difficulty - For a population used to dealing with cash and banks, taking responsibility for ensuring that your own infrastructure and procedures are robust is off-putting and represents something of a learning curve.
* Integration with other financial products - For some bitcoin advocates, this is anathema.  For others, it's a requirement.  For this latter group, being able to move your wealth as you see fit between bitcoin, shares, commodities as easily as you currently do between shares and commodities is important.
* Consumer Risk - many advocates point out how a merchant who "accepts Bitcoin" and converts to fiat immediately, accepts no risk.  The flip side is that consumers accept the risk.  
* Government blockages - see China
None of these is insurmountable.  People are very creative.

Yes.  And I could defer my purchase by a week, and take the concrete losses of paying the charges to turn my euro to BTC, waiting for the BTC to arrive in my account, and then taking those BTC to a retailer who will wash them through some other service just to convert them back to the euro which is all he can accept anyway.  How has this round the houses helped me or the retailer in any way?
It's also why I'm long on bitcoin.  Things can and will get better from here.  However, I can't afford to be that selfless very early mover (locally speaking) adding risk to all my purchases just to stimulate the local bitcoin economy.

It takes weeks/months to get your money out of gox.  That's factored in to raise the selling price.
So, if you buy at $x on bitstamp and sell at x+$100 on gox, then yay for you.  But if it takes 2 months to get your dollars, is that something you're ok with?
The price by then on bitstamp might be x+$300.  Or it might be zero.  By selling on gox, you are taking your money off the table and locking in your gains, but you won't see the cash for a long time.
With cash in your gox account, you have two options.  leave it in there to by when/if the price falls, although you will now be buying at the inflated gox prices.  Or withdraw the cash, which will leave it tied up and unusable in transit for some uncertain number of weeks.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:39:17


I think your logic here is flawed.
The question you ought to be asking yourself is whether you would have been better off if you took the money you used to buy your rig and instead bought bitcoins with it.  If you have the patience, you should also factor in any costs associated with setting up and running the rig, eg electricity costs.
You don't say when you started mining, but let's say it was two months ago, end of September.  At that time you could have bought 1 BTC for about $150.  You mention a "few deoposits of .05 and .01".  If that's a total of about 0.2 BTC, then you could have bought 0.2 BTC two months ago for about $30.  Did your mining rig + electricty costs come to more than that?
Please feel free to adjust the above with real numbers.  I've done the best I can with what you provided.


Not anyone with tens of thousands of dollars or less to invest in mining gear.  None of the ROI calculators give any reason to believe in a return on that sort of investment.

No, the BTC will land much more quickly.  The transaction will need to be validated by the community.  In my experience, this usually takes minutes, but I have heard of it taking up to an hour or two.  Still the fastest transfer in the process.
I'm not up to speed with megacoins.  But would imagine that you'll need to transfer your newly purchased bitcoins to a different wallet.  Again, this should only take minutes.


As above, the delay has been minutes in my experience, but can be an hour or two from what I have heard of others' experience. The price fluctuation is something you just have to accept - whether it works in your favour or against you.  You could insulate yourself a little by going directly from Euro to Megacoin if such an exchange exists.  Then you're only dealing with one exchange rate.


I haven't used it in more than a year, and then I didn't use it much.  I dealt with a seller in Germany and had no issue at all.

@_date: 2013-11-18 17:06:53
It depends on your situation.
If you want to take your cash off the table and lock in your gain, then that's fine.
Just remember, that the cash is locked up for months while it's "in transit".  So if you want to have the same gain next month, you need to put in the same amount again.  And the same for next month.
Put it another way.  if you withdraw at the end of October but won't see your cash until January, then you have to have more or less the same stake to put in again in November.  Sell and withdraw at the end of November and (assuming they can even support two withdrawals in parallel) and both your October and November withdrawals will still be in transit.
Maybe then, maybe, by the start of January, your gox dollars will have reached your account so that you can put them back into the cheaper exchange and start all over again.
IN that case, have only a third of your stake invested at any point, so your 10-15% gain is only on 1/3 of your stake, so it's only 3-5% of your overall stake, or a 33% annualized yield.  It might even be 25% if your starting money is not back in place ready to be invested for closer to 4 months.
Which might be fine.  You're pulling your winnings off the table, which will protect you in times of any prolonged retrenchment/crash.
On the other hand you might do better to keep your money on the cheaper exchange where you can have 100% of it invested at any time, and regularly withdraw your gains from there.

To be honest, if you're a half-decent sized operator who contracts out the site technicalities, I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that you're probably looking at least a couple of days to properly integrate coinbase or some other system into your ecommerce site.  It's not just about the checkout, it's also in the reporting and refunding.  If you have a customer service rep who can click a button to refund a card for a failed purchase, you're going to need something different to refund the bitcoin customer.  never underestimate how things get complicated.
As regards retail outlets, ask any old-time vegetarian how long it took (or is still taking) for restaurants to actually provide really good veggie dishes.  Even though a veggie meal has higher profit margins, and could attract additional customers as veggies everywhere crave decent options when eating out, it is still by excptpion that a restaurant will bother adding delicious veggie meals to their menu.

Couple of thoughts.  
If you're going to use rules, don't assume a couple will suffice.  Implement a rules engine and allow users to create their own rules.

I guess you need to define what you mean by "make it big".
If you mean that a coin will never be worth millions of dollars, you might be right.  
If you are saying that an investment in bitcoin at current prices will not outperform an investment in, say property, or gold, or stocks, then you should probably qualify what term you are talking about, what you are comparing bitcoin against and what you are basing conclusions on.
Otherwise it looks like you're talking through your ass.

A solution like that will be just as good as a combination of
* your ability to design and develop a truly secure application and api
* your ability to successfully lock down your box to prevent unauthorised access 
* your ability to do a penetration test on your API, the server and the hosting facility
* your diligence in keeping your security up to date
Basically all the technical challenges that all existing online wallets face, with perhaps the benefit of a little obscurity.

Hang in there.  Forget about coins for now, and concentrate on whatever you need to do to secure your income and see if you can start rebuilding savings.  When you have your head above water again, you can have a think about whether to put any of your savings into something as speculative as bitcoin.  
Also get a second opinion on your PC from some trusted techie asap.  Make sure it's locked down.  If there's a keylogger on there, you don't know what else it has captured.
One useful idea would be to boot from a linux CD and change any important online passwords.  And use that CD for any online stuff until you get your PC checked out.  That way, even if some logger has already taken your passwords, they'll be useless and they won't see the new ones.

Well, yes.  I was discounting the "ask your kid" reference.
But, if it's true that most wallet software restricts itself to a range, it seems to confer an advantage to use a different method/algorithm that works outside that range.
On the other hand, if it's false, and most wallet software actually uses the full range, then you're not at a disadvantage to be using a subset of that range.
Unless of perhaps someone is hunting specifically for you, and knows your self-imposed restriction

Who can all buy Bitcoin through the established exchanges.  Sure, you can offer a discount.  But only if they are willing to plonk a six figure sum down on a very volatile market.  That may not be how they "conducted their business well / profitably" in the past. 
I would imagine that it's far more likely that the person you find willing to give you a six figure sum for an irreversible transfer of bitcoin to them, is likely to have a conversation shortly afterwards with you, where they explain how it is to the great advantage of the bodily integrity of you and those you love that you return the money to them at your earliest convenience, if not sooner.

What you are describing is the risk associated with currency fluctuation.  Your position is that the retailer should not take any risk, my position is that the consumer should not take any risk.  That appears to be our difference of opinion.




If I buy an item for 1 BTC and then I get it home and discover that it's broken or a fake, and the BTC value doubles, I could return the item tomorrow for 0.5 BTC.  I'm immediately down 0.5 BTC
I get ripped off because the 1 BTC purchase I made in good faith has only been half refunded.  In fact, I have probably lost a lot more, because by the time I get that $1,000 refund into my exchange account and buy some BTC with it, who knows how many BTC I'll get? I am far worse off financially than if I had never bought the item.
Net result, I spent 1 BTC on some broken or fake item, and when I return it, my cash gets locked up for a week and is worth only a fraction of 1 BTC when it's eventually released back into BTC
Meanwhile, if the retailer had the brainwave to hold onto a BTC that was increasing in dollar value at the rate of 100% a day, then they would have basically taken $1,000 for nothing.  Their piece of shit product is back on their shelves and they're a grand up on the deal.


What they do is their choice, not mine.  And they, not me, need to live with the consequences of their decision.
In many cases, they never take the bitcoins at all, they use a third party service to convert it to dollars and ring up the sale in dollars.
If they actually do take the BTC, then it's up to them how long they retain it as BTC.  If the value is increasing at your example rate of 100% a day, they would be mad to exchange it on the day they get it.  At that rate of growth, it would be far cheaper for them to borrow USD (if they're short of cash) to replenish any stock they have to purchase in USD.  The interest they pay on it, will be more than offset by the example growth of 100% per day.
Until BTC is actually treated as a unit of exchange (rather than something to be converted into local currency) by a retailer, dealing with them in BTC is of no extra benefit to me, and in fact puts a lot of risk on my shoulders.  Why on earth would I do it?
If a retailer only, really, deals in local fiat and just has an exclusive deal with some money changer to convert customer BTC into USD, then I will give him local fiat, and let my BTC accumulate in my wallet.

One option is you can try selling them online, posting ads all over the place - just remember that outside of the exchanges, you run a very large risk of your purchaser reversing the credit card transaction after the sale, so you lose out completely.  No coin and no payment.
Another option is to meet up locally for a cash sale, but you may want to pay for security.
You could combine the above with an escrow service.  Never used those, so can't comment.
Finally, you could hit the snooze button and enjoy the dream a little while longer.

Yep.  Whereas for now, you would save 2% or more on a tiny percentage of transactions that will use bitcoin.  When retailers reckon that the numbers tilt in their favour, they'll adopt.


Those retailers have probably outsourced much of their customer care to people far away on a very small wage, probably with a high turnover of staff.  Adding bitcoin as another payment/refund method becomes an additional cost in getting those folks up and running.  And if any of them makes a mistake and issues a bitcoin payment/refund in error, it's for keepsies.  Whereas banks are used to refunding erroneous charges and refunds.
In short, businesses will do this when and only when it makes sense for them.  Talking down to them if they don't won't really help.
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:53:40


Yep.  And it is the practicalities which will dictate the value of bitcoin.  Without them, bitcoin will wither as a wonderful theory.


And if bitcoin continues to be something which is only traded between its core constituency, rather than a mass-market store of value and medium of exchange, then it's not going to the moon and its long term value will be far short of what many of us hope for.

I'm stuck on Gox at the moment.  When I registered there I was not aware of the delays and I wasn't even aware that there were other, cheaper alternatives.
The delay drawing out fiat hasn't been an issue for me, as I haven't had any desire to.  The higher cost of my BTC purchases has been an issue, but only briefly.  With the market rocketing as it has been, it was usually only a matter of hours before the price I paid was that charged on other exchanges.  By far, the biggest issue for me has been that it takes over a week for any new funds to land into my Gox account.
I'm keen to move and have registered on a couple of other exchanges, but waiting an age for the verification process to crawl  to completion.

The relative percentage swings will change, but when may retailers are operating with very tight margins, they will always be something to consider.
Expenses still arise even when a merchant who accepts BTC can also pay its suppliers in BTC.  Keeping an online current account of BTC for this purpose is not something to be undertaken lightly, given that these online coin stores represent a real target for attack.
Moving BTC to offline storage and extracting coins when needed to pay for supplies can be a pretty convoluted process (use some offline, secured pc to create a new wallet, bring your stored funds on line, send payment to supplier, move remainder of stored coins to new offline wallet, store new wallet credentials in some vault).
And so long as there's no critical mass of either customers or suppliers looking to deal in BTC it's hard to see the motivation, unless the merchant is something of an evangelist.
All of this gets sorted with investment in tooling both by the merchant and the broader community.  We're on the road.  I just don't think we're there yet.

Actually, it's the main problem I have and the first one I raised on this thread.  The problem you chipped in on is the separate, additional one.  But anyways...


I do remember that.  On the other hand if the only way for bitcoin to succeed is for people to make purchases with it, when it would be easier and cheaper to make those purchases in local currency, then it's going to fail anyway.  


There's a few things hard about that, actually.
I'm a working guy, feeding three others from my salary.  Two of those are kids with special needs.  I put aside what I can into savings and a small percentage of that goes into the very volatile world of bitcoin.
Most of what I earn goes into paying the mortgage, paying utilities, paying for shit my family needs.  My expenses are higher than most because of the needs of the folks in my family.  And most of the institutions I need to pay don't offer to convert bitcoin.  I don't have a lot by way of disposable income.  I don't have an ipad.  I have a 10 year old PC.  I have a 13 year old car.  I earn good money, but I have high expenses.
If bitcoin loses 30-50% of its value in a dip, my savings take a hit, but I'm relatively sanguine about that because I'm not overexposed, and I fully expect it to recover.
On the other hand, if I stuff the money I need to spend into bitcoin and it takes a 40% bath for a few days, then bad stuff happens - I can't buy the shit my family needs.
Leaving aside the volatility, it's also simply a waste.  I have €500 in the bank to spend on something.  I can withdraw that and hand it over the counter at no cost to me.
On the other hand, I can pay to push my euro into a pipe that it will take a week to come out of, possibly in dollars, so that I can pay to buy a different currency with it, so that I can push that different currency into a converter at the shop, so that the original cash, or most of it, comes back out at the far end for the retailer.
And even that is assuming that the retailer has a converter on site.  If not, it's back down to me to sell on the exchanges, possibly getting dollars back, and see how quickly I can get my local currency back out of the system.
Nobody would encourage me to to that if the other currency was shekels, or yuan, or yen... but because it's Bitcoin, I'm expected to lap it up?  Nah, I don't think so.
I'm long on bitcoin, because I think it has a great future.  In some parts of the world, people are already getting a peek at that future, where it's faster to move in and out of bitcoin, and where many merchants give the impression of accepting it.  But really, bitcoin hasn't delivered yet on what it can achieve in the future.  And where I live, it hasn't delivered yet on what it has already done elsewhere.
So, please, spare me the lectures.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:27:30


Not a great customer service, though is it?  "Shove it all in your trolley, we'll tell you the price later".


On the other hand, in the EU, if a product bought is not fit for purpose, then you are entitled to a full refund of the purchase price.


Again, a crappy customer experience.  Why should a paying customer be left out of pocket just because the store sold them a broken product?  


I disagree.  If they are using a Point of Sale currency conversion service, then they are not accepting bitcoin.  They are accepting whatever their default currency is, and are simply providing a mechanism for you the customer to convert your bitcoin to that currency.  If the BTC customer pays 0.3 BTC for something that doesn't work and only gets 0.2 BTC back when they return it, then that's going to create something of a negative feeling towards the retailer and probably see them badmouthed among the BTC community they are seeking to attract.
On the other hand, if they actually accept BTC, and maintain a BTC cashflow, so that they can refund in BTC, then they customer stays happy, but the shop deals with the risk of currency fluctuation.

* .01 microbitcoins should be called 1 *something* and that what we now call a bitcoin should called *10 million somethings*
And the pressing urgency for that is that people are will be more comfortable using the word "million" than the prefix "micro" when the various needs arise.

They imply relative sizing.  Significance is very different.
Is a metre significant?  It depends.  Measuring the distance between cities, a metre is probably insignificant.  Measuring machine parts, a micrometre is very significant.  
Is a dollar significant?  It depends too.  If I'm buying a bar of candy, a dollar difference in price is significant.  If I'm buying a house, it's not.

Frankly, I don't care what you call any division of the coin.  Knock yourself out.  And when you pick a name that you like and that aligns nicely with the current value of the dollar, then we can do it again when we have a mismatch against the value of the Euro, and again when we want to make it nice against the rupee, and sterling and the yaun and and .... and then we can look at again if in a few years it's gone up another hundredfold.

I'm not in the US, and I found the experience of both just the same.
I signed up at TDAmeritrade.  Had an account in minutes.  Had to upload proof of ID and address, wait a few days for confirmation, wire money to the account, wait for it to land... then I could trade happily.
Just about the exact same process and timelines on both tdAmeritrade and Stamp.

Not at all.  Why would it?  They can find you hours or days after.
I'd write it off as "Hey, it's your money, do what you like with it" but you say it's not.  Apparently, it belongs to some sweet old pensioner whose late husband bought them, and who is understandably risk averse.
It would be far less risky to drip feed the money in an exchange, sell it piecemeal and immediately withdraw the cash balance back to a bank account.
Then again, that would be a perfectly straightforward thing to do.
Either you're determined to ignore the advice of me and the others here, for reasons best known to yourself, or else this whole story is horseshit.  Either way, I'm done.

Yes, I think it might reach 10k.
Bitcoin adoption and penetration is still in its infancy.  There is lots and lots of scope for broader penetration - making it easier to earn, buy and spend bitcoin around the world.  There is lots and lots of scope for deeper penetration - so that retailers aren't immediately converting coin to fiat, but can use it to pay suppliers.  There is lots and lots of scope for greater acceptance in the financial community with bitcoin featuring in commercial investment portfolios and easier trading between stocks and commodities and bitcoin.  There is lots and lots of scope for some of the risks associated with bitcoin to be offset with specialist insurance.  And that's just off the top of my head.
Buying a sandwich at Subway is barely the beginning.

From my own personal experience, and yours may vary, the hoops I had to jump through when opening a TD Ameritrade online stock trading were *exactly* the same as setting up my accounts at different exchanges.
The difference was speed.  One of the exchanges, bitstamp closed out the process faster than TD Ameritrade, the others were slower.

And I'll be very surprised if 90%+ of merchants don't take 90%+ in fiat.  And that's just on bitpay.  Other converters just do 100% fiat.


Bank credit measured in dollars?


Even if the dollars are invisible, they're still dollars.  By the way, are they completely invisible?  Does my receipt from the store quote bitcoin or dollars?  If I look for a refund, will I get my original bitcoin amount back?  Or will I get the dollar equivalent back?


Well, they do to buy their bitcoins.  And they do again if they get refunded in dollars.


Depends on your perspective, and how long "this stage" lasts.  I fear that if we don't break out of this stage in the next 2 years (at most), then bitcoin will have missed its window, and people will simply not bother changing their dollars into bitcoin just to change them back to dollars (even invisible dollars) to buy stuff.

That's my point. If everyone with shares in AAPL, or with Bitcoin, or with anything was to start selling it all, of course the price would drop. That does not mean that AAPL's share price is $530 (or whatever it is), or that the BTC price is $840 (or whatever it is).

Hate to break it to you bud, but the practicalities are what are going to decide the ultimate success of Bitcoin.
If they are solved, then there's a bright future for bitcoin, or perhaps some other cryptocurrency, or perhaps more than one.
I think it's possible that they will be resolved and that bitcoin will have a bright future.  That's why I'm long on bitcoin.  I don't believe it's a foregone conclusion, and that it is in fact very risky, that's why I don't have a high percentage of my investment money in coin.

I think it makes no sense for governments to marginalise bitcoin.
While exchanges are legitimate and banks can legitimately deal with them to move cash in and out of the bitcoin market then the beneficeries can be subject to standard money laundering and other scrutinies.

I don't see the governments going for that.

The dollars etc have already gone.  When you bought your BTC, you gave those dollars to someone.  What he did with them is his business.  They didn't stay in the system anywhere.  
If BTC dropped to zero right now, it just means that you won't find anyone else to give you dollars for your BTC.

@_date: 2013-11-24 20:27:42
That seems to make it much worse.
If I understand you correctly, even wearing USA blinkers, "500 bits" wouldn't mean "US$500".  It would mean 500 times 80 cents.  or 500 times 90c.  or 500 times $214.72. or 500 times whatever .001 BTC happens to be worth today.
Then maybe I discover that the person looking to buy my item is shopping from China, where "1 bit" is approximately .0002 BTC.  I know you talk about this being a thing for within a country, but it's an increasingly global economy and buyers and sellers may meet without ever knowing that they are in different countries.
I just see mass confusion all around, for no tangible benefit.
Why not just quote prices as BTC or whatever national currency takes your fancy?  
You want to do business worth US$500? Just list that as your price.

It's just a lot, lot less likely than someone correctly guessing the details on your ATM card and your PIN number and using that to empty your bank account.
I don't think that the above graphic really helped soothe my mind on this.  The following chain of logic did:
A private key is just 160 bits.  You could punch in the 160 bits that happens to match mine.  But let's see how probable it is:
With 160 bits, there are 2^160 possible combinations.
* If you had the computing power to generate a billion (2^30) keys per second, you would need 2^130 seconds to generate all of them.
* If you had a billion of those computers running in parallel.   You would then only need 2^100 seconds to do it.  
* If you got a billion friends to do the same thing on each of their billion supercomputers, you would only need 2^70 seconds.  
* A year is about 2^25 seconds, so you would need 2^45 years.  
* The estimated age of the universe so far is about 2^33 years.  Time is not on your side.

On the other hand some banks will relish the opportunity to make money converting fiat to bitcoin and bank again.  Over and over again.


Banks can't ban bitcoin.


Most shops that currently "accept bitcoin" don't accept bitcoin.  They adopt the use of some currency conversion service to convert customer bitcoin to local currency.
Even if banks somehow lobbied for banning it, it would only be because it was "too popular", and politicians tend not to ban popular stuff, especially at the request of banks which are probably even less popular than governments at the moment.
Even if some suicidal government did ban shops from accepting them, most shops who currently "accept bitcoin" don't accept bitcoin, and so wouldn't be breaking the law.

I have nothing to base any guess on.
Exchanges are a major target for any serious black hat.  Exchanges [get broken into](  How likely it is for a given exchange is a function of the security of its setup.  I don't have any way of assessing that at this level.
If I could offer you something, it would be that when/if someone does break in, the bitcoin are a much more attractive target than nasty fiat which leaves a reversible trail behind it.  So your dollars might be somewhat safer than any coin there.  But I don't leave anything in.  Then again, I've never tried to cash out.

Consumer demand isn't great and is somewhat artificial.  The vast majority of customers for the vast majority of stores will pay in local currency without batting an eyelid.  Those that do ask if they can pay in bitcoin probably earn their money in local currency and so would prefer to pay in coin, but are in no way restricted to.
If you are geared up to deal in local currency, and practically all your customers spend local currency.  It's not hugely worth the effort of training staff etc and expecting them to be instantly able to deal with the very occasional bitcoin-preferring customer who shows up.
Could this change in time?  I hope so.

The store still gets paid in dollars.  That's the point.  You pay in bitcoin.  The store gets paid in dollars.  The middleman converts the bitcoin to dollars on the market so that they can buy more store credit to sell.
The exact timing of all of this doesn't hugely matter to the point I'm making.  It's still not a bitcoin economy if the store isn't actually accepting bitcoin.
It's a bit like me saying I accept old computer games for sandwiches in my store, when in reality I get the guy who runs the games shop next door to buy your games from you and give me the dollars to pay for your sandwich.

You have no obligation to do hold anything.
Right now, bitcoins exist in an almost completely isolated universe.  For most people, the only way to get coin is to buy some on an exchange.  For most people with bitcoin, the only way to buy anything with that coin is to sell it to buy fiat, and then make your purchase in fiat.
That's a bubble, and every bubble pops eventually.
On the other hand, if people and institutions actually accept bitcoin onto their books and trade natively in bitcoin without resorting to fiat, then bitcoin actually makes the break into being a true medium of exchange.  And the game changes.
There's no "wrong way to use Bitcoin".  There are just sustainable and unsustainable ways.

BTC is worth more than 20% more than it was 24 hours ago (on bitstamp).  If that's a crash, let's have more!

That's not accepting bitcoin. That's providing a facility for your customers to convert their btc to dollars for you to accept.

Only if you *have* to buy coin at some point.  Unless that happens, then you don't lose money by not buying bitcoins.

What if you are buying a $1300 ounce of gold from a merchant in dollars.
You send $1300, but in the few seconds or so it takes to make the transaction, 1 oz of gold becomes worth $1310.
Do you have to pay extra the equivalent of an extra $10, or does the service provider just accept the loss or what?
In either case, I would have thought you pay whatever is shown as the price when you click the button.  But if you're unsure, why not ask the merchant?

People use dollars and cents every day.  They discuss salaries in tens of thousands of dollars, price houses and yachts in millions of dollars, price companies in billions of dollars, and price sticks of gum in cents.  It's not an issue, people aren't dumb as you seem to think.  They figure it out.


I have no idea what "neutral" means in this context.


I disagree.  What makes bitcoins difficult as a pricing mechanism is its huge volatility at the moment.  When that becomes as stable as any other currency, then it will be just as usable.  
No one currency unit can hope to represent a range of values from national debt to cheap sweets.  I'm betting that you've got your head around a scale that runs from $Tn's down to tenths of a dollar.  Yet you think that people are too dumb to understand micro?  You underestimate us.
And if people get sick of saying "microbitcoin", they'll invent their own slang.  Bucks, Quids, Ponies, Large, Grand.... people already  do this all on their own.  They don't need you to do it for them.

I can only think of ~~three~~ four reasons for buying with bitcoin.
1) You want to buy anonymously online
2) You want to spread awareness of BTC
3) BTC is the currency in which your income arrives
4) You're done with bitcoin and want to get out
Other than that, I don't get it.
It costs money to convert national currency to BTC.  It costs money to convert it back to national currency.
If you want to buy a $10 lunch, and you have a choice of paying with ten actual dollars or the equivalent in BTC, I don't get why you would choose to take your appreciating BTC and convert to dollar to pay the bill, and sometime later pay some service charge to replenish your stock of BTC, buy converting a dollar amount to BTC, possibly at a less favourable exchange rate -- when you already had the $10 in your pocket!
But each to his own.

The only people who have lost money are those who bought btc, and then sold them at a lower price.
You paid €30 for them.  Sometime before that, they were worth less than a cent.  You didn't lose money when you bought them.
If someone buys them from you now and gives you the €2400, they don't lose money unless they sell them for less than that at sometime in the future.

You want to arrange a cash transaction for over a million dollars worth of a commodity whose exchange cannot be reversed?
Think about that for a second.
What sort of person will be able to put together that sort of cash and be keen to spend it on a volatile commodity?
What sort of business will that person be in?  And how do you think they have conducted their business to arrive at a situation where they can pull together to sort of cash you are talking about?
Now that you have an idea of your customer, how do you think that the deal is likely to go down?
Moving it through the online exchanges is probably your safest bet.  Move it online in small batches, over a couple of exchanges, and sell each batch at market rates as soon as it arrives.  Then withdraw the cash asap.

Gyft, Bitpay and others allow you to sell your bitcoin for the fiat which merchants actually accept. You're still dumping your coin for fiat to make your purchase. The only thing which you have bought with your coin is the fiat.

What are the circumstances under which litecoin will increase by 700% while BTC stays static?
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:20:40
Mostly, they are not accepting bitcoin, merely converting it to dollar at point of sale.  The customer is accepting all the risk.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:04:54
True, and I've pretty much ignored the noise up to now.  But my choices are not limited to "accept it or gtfo".. I can also speak up once in a while against the horseshit.

Depends on why you did it.
If you bought to make a profit in 48 hours, you took a risk.  It might pay off.
If you bought to invest for the more distant future, you took a risk.  It might pay off.
If you bought to use as a checking account and buy stuff with it now, you took a risk.  It might pay off.
There are no definites here.  I think you did fine.  I could be wrong.

If you are finding it hard to explain bitcoin, perhaps you need to work on your explanation a little.
By the way, how old is "old"?

Nope, sorry.  I don't use okpay.  That's why I didn't reply to the original.
I did want to highlight and report the scammer, though.

Bitcoin needs a few things to happen before it strides forward into the next level.  Wall Street acceptance is one of them.  I have believed for some time that next year is Make or Break for that to happen.  It's looking positive.
