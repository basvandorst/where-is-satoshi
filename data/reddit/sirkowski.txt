Sorry for your loss.

Imagine buying crypto.
@_date: 2019-07-20 03:54:34
Your family is right.
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:27:05
What is entropy?
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:52:16
If only there was a type of ubiquitous commercial establishment where you can keep money safe and insured.
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:12:39
Even a con artist like Trump knows crypto isn't worth it.
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:40:52
Your first mistake was investing in crypto.
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:17:54
This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-16 19:23:01
I mean, they're not wrong.
@_date: 2019-11-09 17:07:30


@_date: 2019-11-20 04:27:30
More like something criminal.

Last time to buy under ~~20 000$ 12 000$ 10 000$ 9000$ 8000$~~ 7000$!
@_date: 2019-11-03 01:21:29
If only there was some sort of financial institution where your money and investments were insured thanks to government regulation.
@_date: 2019-11-07 23:19:42
The medium is as awful as the message.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:02:23


She was right about that part.

Bitcoin enthusiasts are crypto fascists (pun intended), tax evaders, libertarians, pedophiles, sovereign citizens, criminals, pyramid scammers, get rich quick marks, etc. That's why.
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:47:04
That's why people hate fascism?
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:44:05
Wow, we really do live in a society.
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:26:03
Just buy lottery tickets instead. The odds are better.
@_date: 2019-08-11 01:18:55
You already got scammed. Sell before you lose more.
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:35:07


He's not wrong.
@_date: 2019-10-21 15:52:00
If you've exchanged real money for spreadsheet Beanie Babies, yes, you got scammed.

Upvoting this for the truth.
@_date: 2019-08-23 22:42:37
Nah, he's using a strawman.
@_date: 2019-06-09 11:42:56
That's good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:41:50
@_date: 2019-08-19 14:20:06
Banks have insurance for this type of thing.
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:27:09
You should have grown out of that phase after high school.
@_date: 2019-08-22 15:36:18
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:22:53
The scam only works if there's enough suckers bagholding.

It's never too late to be poor!

Last chance to buy at ~~20 000$ 15 000$ 10 000$ 9000$ 8000$ 7000$~~ 6000$!
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:13:10
Yeah, it really sucks to have your transactions insured and protected. /s
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:46:00
Shit car for a shit coin.

Imagine playing a reversed funnel lottery with your savings while your wife has cancer...
@_date: 2019-12-31 18:33:59
My dirty fiat ATM is 0%.
@_date: 2019-12-04 03:47:45
Overreacting much?
@_date: 2019-12-09 18:23:21
You should try North Korea.

Nobody ever explained to you how Pascal's Wager is a flawed argument?
@_date: 2019-09-02 04:25:20
Pascal's Wager is dumb as hell.
@_date: 2019-09-17 03:08:12
Seems like the problem here isn't Barclays but Local Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-17 16:43:18






@_date: 2019-09-30 17:49:56
The reason why it's not a big deal is because nobody that matters is buying crypto.
@_date: 2019-09-07 19:35:05


There's people who've made a career out of card reading.
@_date: 2019-09-06 16:05:30
This wouldn't happen at a bank.
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:22:07
If you think the lottery is an investment, you should be worried.
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:24:28
Or the band playing on the Titanic...
@_date: 2019-09-17 03:02:01


Because it has no other widespread use than scamming.

When they came for the Nazis I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Nazi.
The End.
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:19:20
Yes, I agree. All the people you've named are Nazis.
