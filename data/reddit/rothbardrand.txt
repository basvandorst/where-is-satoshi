Well if he is running 10.7 then it hasn't changed. But without knowing the version he is running I can't prove which changes have been made. So the burden is on you.

Imagine if every miner who found a block changed the rules!
I think it's clear that satoshi laid out a vision and its proper for us to reject things that deviate.
I believe in that vision enough that I would follow it thru a PoW change and loss in hashpower and price, etc.

Every alt is a fork of bitcoin. None have hurt it or will hurt it.
a fork with the same chain is no different.
The one that gets all the hashpower will be bitcoin. I expect that will be core.
But if they manage to make their BU alt viable, it's not any more a threat to bitcoin than CLAMS.

You really should read your citations- that checksum is on the encrypted data, it's not the checksum of the files that were encrypted.  And of course even if it were CRC32 is not a fingerprint. And you still have to prove that he was running the version in this paper, and thatbif this were a vulnerability that it hadn't been patched.
Etc etc.
Your entire argument is speculative, yet you want to lock someone up for years based on your feelings.

LOL! You completely miss the point. The point is you can make any file you want- say a child porn image or a Warhol portrait, have the same CRC32 as the targeted.  You should have read past the first sentence in that answer I linked to.
So for any given CRC32 (say a checksum in the file system to make sure an encrypted file hasn't been corrupted) I can claim it is actually some other file by taking that other file and appending gibberish to an area that is ignored by the displaying software, or flip insignificant bits a bit to produce the same CRC32, and a dumbass like you will believe they are the same file!
Never mind that the CRC32 checksum is for the encrypted data, not the original unencrypted form, and most likely is for a sector or other disk level object-- file vault from back in the day- so not even the version in the targets machine- split up disk images into individual files which represented the file system, thus exposed no information about the files. Nowadays even that is encrypted, but even then didn't reveal the metadata you are assuming.
The hilarious thing is you are purely speculating that they somehow have access to this info based on an ancient paper despite him having a different form of disk encryption all together.
Yeah I doubt you really are a libertarian otherwise you wouldn't be throwing the fifth amendment (and fourth for that matter since they have no PC) out the window.  Oh and of course the claim they have CRC32s of the unencrypted files is asinine as I've proven.
No I blame the government run schools.  I keep pointing this stuff out, I keep explaining it, I even linked you to an external source so you didn't  have to take my word for it, and I can't make you think.
Even basic cognition is beyond you and logic is apparently too much to ask!
LOL! 
But you are now lying about what I have said and that makes me think you are fundamentally dishonest - which precludes you from being a libertarian because fraud is a violation of the NAP- or not even paying attention.
The funny thing is you have failed to find a single error in anything I've said- and the more you dig the more you prove yourself wrong.  You don't even know what a cryptographic hash is!  You think a checksum is one. 
But you seem to think you are winning!  
Just amazing.
Bottom line: 
- no evidence they have access to hashes of the files.
- CRC32 is a checksum, not a cryptographic hash
- his version of FileVault is different to the ancient one
- for any given CRC32 it is trivial to alter another file to produce the same CRC32
- this is the whole reason cryptographic hashes were invented in the first place as checksums do not provide evidence of uniqueness
- you should be really embarrassed.
- I'm at a loss for why you aren't unless you are so triggered your blind rage has shut down all reasoning (or maybe you are retarded.)
- I work with cryptography and crypto hashes and checksums and even error correction codes on a daily basis, you admittedly aren't even trained in this area.
Go re-read that stack overflow answer again and think about it.  Literally shows you how I fake the evidence you are speculating exists.

Actually, you claim it's the same version of FileVault as the one from your paper, I'm asking what version of the OS it is so I can check.
Oh, and by the way, while every version of OS X has bash, the version of Bash they ship with changes! If FileVault hasn't changed- as you assert- prove it!
The truth is you don't know and your entire argument is speculative and increasingly obviously to you, asinine.
By the way, I can't look up the change log for file vault (or more precisely Apple press releases because it's closed source) without knowing which version of the OS we are talking about.  I shouldn't need to explain that but you seem to be thick.
So I ask again, which version of macOS was he using?
Oh and by the way, I happen to go to WWDC regularly and watch the videos when I don't and every year Apple has a "what's new in security" or other session that covers the changes they have made.  They update filevault pretty regularly.
The idea that they haven't fixed a metadata leakage that was disclosed to them in that paper you linked to in 6 years is beyond asinine.

Hello, Luke.  I'm a computer expert. Please listen to me on this, and show your work if you still disagree.
ASIC resistance means that there is not a way for one customized device to have a significant performance advantage over what's generally available.
ASICs work for SHA because it takes a large number of general purpose instructions to calculate the hash while dedicated circuitry can do it faster.  This is because SHA as a proof of work is proof of computation and relies on the assumption that computation cannot be arbitrarily sped up, a false assumption in this case.
Taking something where computation is not the core work being proven can create ASIC resistance. 
An example of this may be a memory hard hash where memory latency or bandwidth is used as the limiting factor.
No fab in china is going to come out with a chip that has ten times the memory performance as what is out there now.  Further these characteristics are very valuable to the gaming industry as well as deep learning and so there is already more money being invested in optimizing DRAM bandwidth and latency than is currently captured by bitcoins market cap.
Should someone come up with a significantly faster memory technology it will be replicated by the GPU makers and again become generally and democratically available.
Put another way, GPUs are already a collection of ASICs focused on the memory access problem, thus a proof of work based on them, short of compromises being found, will be more democratic and lack the concentration of power that comes with ASICs.
This has worked for Equihash and Daggar Hashimoto and probably will be even more true for Cuckoo. 
In the case of equihash some optimizations were found, giving GPUs an edge over the goal of CPU mining, but that's still a far cry from an ASIC.  
If one were to commit seriously to this strategy one could use parameters requiring over 4GB of RAM (equihash is at 1GB).   8GB GPUs are readily available and if one were foolish enough to make an ASIC they would still have to connect it to 4GB+ of RAM.
You think they are going to just come up with an order of magnitude more performant memory system?
Because if they can't, and they can't, then memory hard proofs of work are ASIC resistant.

Equihash has proven to have some optimization but not too significant. Cuckoo seems stronger, but may well have similar vulnerabilities.  Possibly the Argon issue can be resolved with different parameters.

I used to support classic- at the time SegWit was an idea. At that time there was too much censorship- though now I think it makes sense given the quality of the "arguments" I'm seeing.  Anyway, eventually I read the SegWit paper and came to understand how bitcoin works on a more fundamental and less theoretical level.
I think most people who support BU and oppose SegWit believe that core is a centralization threat and dont understand how bitcoin works technically or economically well enough to see why their position is bad for bitcoin.
Really if they are a big blocker SegWit gives them bigger blocks.  So I think it's pure ideology.

LOL! A checksum is a kind of hash function but not a cryptographically secure one.   It's only purpose is to verify if a file hasn't been changed- it doesn't uniquely identify files and anybody who reports it does is committing perjury.  Hell thats why it's called a checksum, not a hash.  Jesus the mind boggles at how unwilling you are to think.
It would be trivial to produce scores of files with the same checksum if one were trying to. It would be trivial to force CRC collisions if one wanted to.
And of course, this proves they have no evidence he has CP.  Just bullshit that might sway the ignorant and dullards like you, but only if the opposition is denied the opportunity to rebut it.
Also you realize the first footnote of that paper indicates it was written in 2011. The year 10.7 was released. HALF A DECADE AGO.  There have been several major updates to filevault.  The current version of macOS is 10.12 and 10.13 is due this summer.

The core of bitcoin is consensus, and some "market based consensus" doesn't sound like bitcoin at all, and that's because it isn't.

@_date: 2017-03-21 20:14:57
No, it is not known.  It is asserted, and the reasoning given for the assertion doesn't pass the smell test.  
In short I know for a fact that someone is either lying or doesn't understand the technology well enough to accurately relate the situation sufficient to distinguish from it being a lie.
The drive is encrypted with filevault and they don't have access to the password - therefore they have no method of knowing the hashes of the files in that drive.  Period.  That's how encryption works.  So this claim is an obvious lie and if it was made under oath someone perjured themselves.
Secondly, no that doesn't mathematically literally mean anything. Depending on the quality of these alleged hashes (which I'm certain don't exist as described) it's quite easy for there to be a hash collision.  If they were strong then you could say the probability is small.  But we don't know and cops have been caught red handed misrepresenting these kinds of statistics.
Yeah just reread the article. The cops are straight up lying. They have no evidence of child porn. And they indicate no evidence that those files are on those drives- viewing a webpage is not the same as downloading data though cops will lie and say it is. No evidence that the files were actually downloaded and put on that drive.
Further, even if they weren't lying, and they did have such proof, compelling him to give up the code violates the 5th amendment as the Supreme Court has ruled in the past and jailing him for not doing so is itself a felony under USC-18-242.... but if course the government isn't going to hold its judges or cops accountable under the law
This whole situation is just further proof that the system is completely corrupt.

You really need to read more than the first line of things.  You can make a CRC of an encrypted file, but that doesn't tell you anything about the underlying file.

LOL! First off that paper is about a version of file vault that is two generations older. In fact it is a different product all together, just marketed under the same name. That version only encrypted the home directory and may have leaked metadata as a consequence of the drive being mountable without the key.  Though the paper doesn't support your claim.  The article indicates this is Whole disk encryption and it would have to be since it is two extra drives, not the boot drive.
Secondly, AES-128 is a stream cipher, not a hash.  The concept of a collision for a stream cipher is nonsensical.
Really hard to take you seriously when you say something as dumbass as that.  Seems you don't know what a hash is.
Anyway, my point remains-/ even if they did have proof the files were there, they have no right to compel testimony.

Please try reading.  It's trivial to create an example file that has the same CRC32, dumbass. He are you going to prove it's not the original child porn file? Do defense attorneys have troves of child porn to see if the cops altered it?
Also you realize whenever a file is edited, it changes.  Trivial to edit the file thus way, produce the collision, and claim the defendant just has the exited version. A defense attorney has a similar file with a different CRC32? What does that prove, it's just a different version!  Where are you going to get the "original" anyway?
Like I said- and you continue to ignore- this is the reason cryptographic hash functions were invented. A redundancy check is not a cryptographically secure hash function.  It's LITERALLY a checksum.  IT'S IN ITS NAME!
But at least you are no longer pretending like it's not trivial to create a collision- like you were last night.
So you've admitted your claims were wrong, but you won't admit you are wrong.

FileVault doesn't work that way. Logs don't log hashes, if they are internet logs.  None of this makes sense from a technical perspective.

Half the cooling in GPUs is memory. They are cheap compared to ASICs as they benefit from economies of scale. You don't seem to understand how memory is wired in GPUs, they use wide buses. It would be easy to make a proof of work that requires more than 4GB RAM. You haven't and cannot make the argument that ASICs would be significantly more power efficient. ASICs will never be cheaper to produce than GPUs because no economies of scale and DRAM is the key expense anyway.   
None of your claims are correct.
You're operating under the assumption there's some magical power that ASICs have- because it seemed that way when they sped up SHA.  But as I've pointed out there's an entire industry already commoditizing memory.

Your "source" didn't even support your position so it didn't need to be proven wrong.  You seem to think linking to someone else's guesses on the internet is some sort of citation of authority- and if that weren't bad enough- it would be fallacy of argument from authority if they were an authority, rather than some author for an enthusiast site. 
You realize that a modern GPU with 8GB of RAM running this kind of PoW would be using about 80watts?  Maybe significantly less in 2018 the way things are going.  That means by even your numbers over half the power is going to memory. (Your "source" claims 30w for 4GB)
You haven't provided any reason to believe ASIC memory will be superior.  You admit that reducing power on the computation side is not significant. You seem to think that somehow ASICs will have more "connectors" to memory, but you don't seem to realize that memory controllers are a requirement.  You haven't shown any reason to believe that ASICs will have better memory controllers, in fact your "source" is citing GPU memory types that aren't even close to bring available for general use PCs. 
In fact you haven't made an argument and you haven't attempted to rebut mine. You have taken quotes out of context and lied about them, you have used those lies to imply falsehoods about me.  And your attempt at an argument is mostly assertions that reflect a vague faith that somehow ASICs will render GPUs uncompetitive despite providing no reasoning to believe so, no arguments for superior performance and admitting that your claims of better power efficiency are not significant.
In fact you have utterly failed to comprehend that the critical item in a memory hard proof of work is the memory, and until you can provide some reason to believe you can make better, faster memory for an ASIC that won't be adopted by GPUs, you can't even begin to make an argument.
You do have a lot of attitude, and insults, and misrepresentations of my position which serves to obfuscate the debate and may succeed in convincing non-technical people aligned with you on ideological grounds, but which I find profoundly anti-intellectual and tiresome.
You seem to think you can repeatedly demand I cite a source despite giving no reason to doubt my positions and thus nothing that a source is needed to defend- a purely rhetorical approach that insults the intelligence of anyone reading this.
You may feel I am attacking you, but unlike your insults and characterizations of my person, I am merely describing the lack of argument on your part.
If you want to get on track, I propose you describe in some detail how you would build an ASIC to compete with GPUs using equihash or cuckoo with a 5GB memory requirement-- my original examples.  Please also include some reasoning about the economics- why a sustainable competitive advantage can be achieved by ASIC makers.
Edit:  consider this: Daggar Hashimoto has no ASICs created for it yet there are X11 ASICs for coins with much lower value.  Isn't that an existence proof that contradicts your position?  And I'm proposing 4-5GB of memory requirements.

No but you did.  It's exactly what I'm talking about doing.  You have an example file you want to claim the target file is the same. You can change that example file as much as you want. The target file doesn't change.
So one can take any Warhol portrait and add metadata to it to change its CRC32 and then "prove" that the encrypted file with that same CRC32 is a Warhol file.
And then turn around and take a screenshot of your asinine and very embarrassing posts, convert it to JPEG, and flip insignificant bits that don't alter the image but do alter the CRC32, to "prove" that THATs what the target file is.
This really isn't that complicated, if you will top being triggered and actually think about it.

The only reason mining in china has an edge is the government is subsidizing it.
You can always have trade wars when this happens.  E.G. "Cheap Japanese cars/Ram" back when Japan was doing it.  Now Toyota is the largest car company in the world but they don't have the market locked up.
If china wasn't providing below market power and capital costs they wouldn't be able to drive the difficulty above sustainability in other countries.
In most industries this drives down price of the product and we can profit from their subsidies- but the emission of bitcoin is fixed.
So what it does is incentivize us to get an edge in areas where we have a competitive advantage-- like technology.
This is why core protocol control can't fall into Chinese hands. They don't have the capability.
But we shouldn't lament that we can't mine- they are securing our coins at below market rates for us- and subsidizing us in the process.
Eventually this will stop and mining will be more global.  Either because they screw up and fork bitcoin and we shift PoW, or because the spigot of free money stops.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:41:17
Look at Equihash and Cuckoo.  If your PoW is memory latency or bandwidth constrained and you need &amp;gt;1GB of RAM- or even more, like 5GB, one can't just make an ASIC for it.  Sure maybe you can make an ASIC that is faster than a compute core on a GPU but it's the memory that is the bottleneck.  GPUs are focused on delivering the fastest possible access to the fastest possible RAM.  The memory industry is already working in this speeding it up and has reached pretty much the limits of current technology- no way with an ASIC you can get a leg up like they did with SHA.
I don't think anyone can consolidate control over DRAM, or memory controllers, and the billions being spent on it already far exceeds what is being spent in bitcoin ASIC R&amp;amp;D-- there is already a huge market with wide distribution.
Any break through in performance would be applicable to the game industry and quickly replicated by GPU makers.
This would be a much better choice than say, SHA-3 which will put us right back in this same spot in a few years.
Maybe memory hard will not prevent centralization forever- I'm not saying it's a panacea, just that there seems to be no way one could make a competitive ASIC without having worse economics than a GPU at no better performance- for maybe a decade.

The idea that we are beholden to the Chinese miners is a silliness that they seem to be operating under.  But the results will be painful if they don't wise up.

So you're saying the defense attorney is going to pull child porn from the internet in the courtroom? That the site hasn't been taken down?  That there's some authoritative canonical version of the file?  Do you even logic, bro?
And of course this is completely irrelevant because the same file can exist in multiple versions with different CRC32s.  Completely different files can have the same CRC32 values as well.  And it's trivial to create a version of any file that will have the goal CRC32. 
And of course the existence of a version that doesn't match doesn't repudiate the claim that the version that does is the same file.
Are you capable of thinking?
Cop just says defendant has a different version. A version like the one the cop magically has. Cant verify it, site is taken down, not that the site would be counted on to be authoritative anyway as the internet is not an immutable database.
And as pointed out this isn't a cryptographic hash function in the first place.

Yeah you don't know what consensus is, as the fees are not part of it. Proof of work is the mediating mechanism.  Fees are there to incentivize miners to include transactions in blocks- but some miners, for instance, mine empty blocks.
If you were right those blocks would be invalid.
 I know far more about this than you think you do.
Bitcoins consensus is not some market mechanism, that's asinine. The fees may be determined by an emergent market, but consensus doesn't depend on it.

You linked to a flyer for HBM, but it doesn't support your numbers. I see where it says greater bandwidth per watt- which I have known from the beginning. What market do you think HBM was developed for in the first place?  You're basically proving my point that GPUs drive memory optimization.  Anyway assuming somewhere it says 8GB will take 30 watts, it's irrelevant because your "source" was still speculation and you made an ass out of yourself about it.
But what your source did say was 30 watts for 4GB, 8 GB would be 60watts, which is well more than half of 80watts.   So attacking me for bad math is typical dishonest bullshit to try and make an insult.  
You're so busy nit picking point by point that you're not even addressing my argument, not to mention your frequent asides for insults and smears.
The funny thing is, your economics don't make sense- even if you could make an "ASIC" for %50 less it's still not competitive because you can recover %80 of the cost of a GPU.
At any rate, you're ignoring NRE and the lack of economies of scale and the like.  And really- you claim it can be made cheaper but that doesn't show any kind of order if magnitude improvement over GPUs like ASICS had in performance.  In fact not actually faster you're just repackaging the same technology in a way you think is cheaper if you ignore design, engineering, distribution and manufacturing costs and economies of scale. And resale value.
Actually I guess now that you tried to claim it was lower power and are now claiming it is cheaper (by ignoring costs) you're basically admitting I'm correct.
Cause you sure haven't shown the 30X performance numbers you found for X11 in your design.  In fact you're basically assuming the cost of the computation part is zero, and while memory latency and bandwidth are the bottlenecks, if you hitch them to an inadequate memory controller and CPU you can create new bottlenecks.
OMG!  You're assuming you can just magically get the 30X power consumption improvement from X11- a computationally bound algo-- for a memory hard hash function!
There it is. The "magic" part.
You don't even seem to understand how these hash functions work.  Please read the white papers. 
Jesus- I must admit for awhile I thought you might not be just blindly assuming an ASIC will make everything faster!  Holy fuck.
What a waste of time.
I should have known when you started off with the snotty attitude you couldn't back it up. 
Here's from my original comment to Luke, showing you are once again straight up lying when you say I was never talking about 5GB:
"If one were to commit seriously to this strategy one could use parameters requiring over 4GB of RAM (equihash is at 1GB).   8GB GPUs are readily available and if one were foolish enough to make an ASIC they would still have to connect it to 4GB+ of RAM."
But just ignore that like you've ignored all the others.

No, people aren't desperate for a change, and in fact you have a great option for a great deal of improvements- those 4,000 commits increase capacity and speed.

You have used some logic but you ignore the FACTS that prove you wrong because your entire argument is that CRC32 is a fingerprint and not a checksum, despite linking to a Wikipedia page that says otherwise.

@_date: 2017-03-22 15:19:15
Uh, basic math, can you speak it?
CRC32 is a four byte checksum on an original file that can be unlimited length.
8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 32
Those four bytes are the checksum and they accumulate as you read the data in the file.  If you know the end state checksum you want to produce, you can easily produce it via several methods, as explained in the stack overflow answer you seem determined to refuse to read.
You could do it by appending some data to the end of the file.  You could do it by simply finding several bytes in the file that can be changed without affecting decoding and then changing them randomly until you get the target CRC32 for the whole file- this would be an easy brute force method that doesn't require even understanding how CRC32 is calculated. 
You don't have to change a significant part of the file- as the guy says, four bytes at the end would do it.  Doesn't matter if the file is gigabytes long.
CRC is a redundancy check- it's just to check if the file has been altered. It's not a fingerprint.  That's been my point all along.
Hell you can't use CRC32 to confirm a file exists.  You seem to think this is a cryptographic hash function but as I've repeatedly proven it isn't.
The term "message" is a term of art in computer science and cryptography that can include files or messages in flight or packets or database records, whatever.
You're letting terminology in the first fucking line of the stack overflow answer stop you from reading the whole thing?
PS- regarding fake evidence the FBI, for instance has had many scandals where it was later proven they committed fraud. None of these criminals have gone to jail. Where's the risk?  
Thee are many more but I'm done doing research for you since you won't even bother to read pages YOU LINK ME TO! 
Also as I pointed out it's trivial to "prove" that the picture in question is really a Warhol portrait AND the Declaration of Independence!  But you're ignoring that aren't you?
Jesus, you think I'm just refusing to admit I'm wrong but I keep proving you wrong.  
Why can't you see it?
Your error is really basic- you think CRC32 is like SHA256.  But it isn't.  I pointed this out the first time you mentioned CRC32.  When are you going to accept it?
Hell ask any honest person who knows about cryptographic hash functions and they will tell you.
Or read the fucking stack overflow answer.
You claim it is proof he has child porn. I've proven that not only do you not have CRC32 of the files, but even if you did, it's trivial to create-- or by accident-- have a collision.
It would be hilarious if cops just did a CRC32 of all the child porn they found and then believed any file with the same result is also child porn.

Shouldn't take that long to make a prototype given the way FPGAs are programmed. Assuming there is enough RAM, this isn't really relevant to the issue because equihash- for now- uses a relatively small amount of RAM- only 1GB.
Still even if Z.cash doesn't switch to a larger RAM requirement, as they said they would, there's no evidence and not much reason to believe that FPGAs will have an advantage over commodity GPUs to justify their increased costs.  That's the whole point of a RAM hard proof of work.
FPGAs had an advantage for SHA because instead of many clocks to produce a hash they could do it in a few.  Purpose build processor is faster by reducing the work- because SHA as a proof of work is proof of how many calculations.  That's not how RAM hard PoWs work.
There's no magic FPGA advantage in RAM performance.
To be honest this implies the people who claim to be developing FPGAs for equihash don't understand the basics of how computation works.

The point is the length of the chain doesn't matter, but the hashes do- the proof of work and the difficulty. I was saying you could easily just build a long chain- but it would be rejected.  Both because the software has checkpoints, but more to the point, because the software takes difficulty into account.
But if bitcoin didn't do those two things (and other checks) then it would be trivial- just take genesis block, keep difficulty low and blow thru thousands of blocks a second until you have a chain longer in block count than the real one.
This won't work, because of the above mentioned checks- and the fact that it won't work WAS MY ENTIRE POINT in the comment you replied to saying I was wrong.

Aw, you hate that YOU made a citation that refutes YOUR claim, so you make insults!  Of course!  How many times has that happened now? There was the original paper, then the Wikipedia articles- twice! Then the claim FileVault had never been updated. I count four times- you aren't even reading your own citations! 
More insults, more admission that you know I'm right. Do please feel free to stop responding.  I'm certainly done taking you seriously.  But let's review your fallacies:  Which version of macOS is he running?  "It's never been patched" &amp;lt;links to patch&amp;gt; You can make a CRC of an encrypted file, but that doesn't tell you anything about the underlying file.  A CRC32 of a cryptext is not the same as a CRC32 of the plaintext, meaning all of these claims to have access to CRC32s of the original files are obvious lies.  You know CRC32 is trivial to collide right?  Trivial to change four bytes in a file, and have it still be rendered the same and "obviously child porn". Warhol AND Declaration of Independence are the same document!  4 times 8 is 32!  
This really isn't that hard.  It's been explained by me multiple times, by Wikipedia, by stack exchange, they all agree with me. All you have is speculation and insults claiming I can't understand logic.

There's no legitimate reason for big blockers to oppose SegWit.  That BU does shows it's about ideology, not advancing the state of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:06:09
You're rewriting history and misrepresenting things.  SegWit was part of a compromise agreement, which the miners broke before it was even released. The mining community was lined up behind it at the time of the agreement.  I'm at quite a loss for why they are not doing so now, unless they are attempting a coup. They certainly aren't acting in their best interests or even responsibly. 
The core deva offered a compromise, the miners agreed to it, and the big blockers and miners broke it. They are responsible for their actions.
BU is not pragmatic, it is an incompetent developer fork as was shown last week.
You have no technical arguments against SegWit, and you are misrepresenting things which makes me believe this is ideology- or even worse- you're not even aware of the history and technical factors.

Bot nets won't be able to do a modern PoW especially if it is memory hard.  Bother operators know that causing the ms gone to act up or slow down is the number one cause for it to drop from their network.

SegWit is nakimoto consensus, it just splits out the signatures for transactions so clients can be even lighter. It changes the header to have a separate witness data erea. It also allows up to %400 more data per block so it increases scalability-- but the fundamental concerns us algorithm is satoshi a proof of work system.
BU has a new consensus  algorithm that is untested and can allow for very long chain splits before reaching consensus, something satoshi sought to avoid.

Your first assertion is false on the face if it, as signaling for SegWit has been in there for almost a year- and by the HK agreement that's signaling for the 2mb block size.
Secondly whether this is achieved by hard or soft fork is irrelevant so focusing on the method is an attempt to have your cake and eat it too.
Thirdly, every miner signaling BU right now is in violation of the agreement.

I'm one of those design oriented developers, with a strong passion for UI and UX, but I think you are way underestimating the difficulty of developing good solutions for bitcoin and it's importance.  A great UX is irrelevant if the security is bad.  And great security is a lot harder than great UX ( I've worked on both.)
You're really missing the point if "cypherpunks write code"-- the point is it's really easy to demand things and have opinions when you have no skills or technological understanding-- e.g. Roger Ver-- and is really easy to have ignorant opinions.
Making code that survives in the wild is a lot harder.

I would suggest the writings of Warren Buffet, Timothy Vick’s Buffet books and Mary Buffets “Buffetology”   Much if it isn’t relevant to crypto, but the risk is having bad or negative returns.  Better to have a small number of investments you watch very closely and are an expert on than a portfolio you know little about.

I haven't been watching the difficulty and cost curve closely, but I think beyond one generation equipment for most people paying for power isn't viable anymore and they will shit it down.  But power costs vary and in China it may be essentially free extending that mix.   
I do think you could model it pretty well be taking the difficulty change over time and attributing the increase that occurs during a period (e.g. The hashing power that causes that increase) to the current generation equipment at the time, and then take a baseline electrical cost assumption and roll over all equipment to the current equipment when the electric costs equal the revenue.

You point out there are record numbers which means that people are leaving, because if taxes, but are lying about why.
Taxation being theft is a literal fact.  You don't get to pretend otherwise.  You claim society disagrees with me- well you can't prove that.  A group of violent thugs that rule over society enslave us and extort tax money- but might doesn't make right.

Technological explanations are not effective, but you feed them a story that they can believe in that strokes their ego and they are sold.

False.  SegWit solves as promised for test net in April and delivered by May 2016.   Since activation was requiring a soft fork, they put it into activation mode in November 2016.  6 months testing is reasonable.
The delay is entirely due to miners refusing to activate it.
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:59:40
Assuming Jihan opposes UASF,  and is willing to go all in...
If they have more of the hashing power, relative to the UASF chain, then they will make blocks faster.  Their nodes will think they have the longest chain.  UASF will slow down for a couple weeks, possibly dramatically.  During this time they will be championing using their shill army that UASF is a "contentious hard fork" and that "UASF has failed."  They will sell UASF chain on the exchanges and buy their chain and start a campaign of calling themselves "bitcoin" and calling the UASF chain "SegWit".   Until retargeting blocks will be slow and the campaign will claim SegWit has failed.
Isn't that a likely scenario?

Would take a compute milliseconds to pull the BIP-39 seeds out of those 500 words, then only a few seconds to try them, since they would still be in order.   If it finds 70 words from the dictionaries it wouldn't take very long to test all standard seed phrase lengths- especially since the last word is a check sum.  It wouldn't have to generate a single private key to find the wallet. Just see if they pass the checksum.
If you are doing this I urge you to secure your seed better.

Memory hard algorithms like Equihash, Cuckoo and possibly dagger hashimoto are pretty immune to ASICS.   The latter has powered the number two crypto for years without ASUCS and effectively every memory chip is already a memory ASIC, so the ASICs are commoditized and widely available.

Reading the license, it basically shuts keepkey out from republishing the Trezor code.  Basically this code is auditable to make sure Trezor is honest, but it's not open source, you can't take their source, change it and redistribute it in any form.

BTC would be the most profitable initially after a switch.  Right now, the miners have a choice between Ethereum and zcash for popular memory hard coins.  The hashrate follows what is most valuable.  If BTC switched to a memory hard algorithm, they would quickly suck up a large chunk of hashing power from the market. If it went too far and ETH became more valuable to mine, people would switch to bring them into an equilibrium.  This is the way it works right now.  People switch between Equihash and dagger hashimoto based on the relative profitability of the two.
GPU mining is not rigid like ASICs.  Some cards have a performance advantage for some algorithms, but it's relatively easy to switch.
Also many miners mine for ideological and speculative reasons.
BTC would have no problem attracting more hash power than Ethereum has now.

Correct.  2mb blocks won't improve the situation, but if combined with genuine SegWit (not what Jihad is demanding in his UAHF press release) would be a compromise I'd be very happy with.  And then give it a year or two and see if we need even larger blocks, but I doubt we will.

@_date: 2017-06-20 07:27:50
At %80 everyone else would jump on the bandwagon is what I was saying.
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:02:59
If this were true, then the engineering superiority of the core position would be obvious to you.
@_date: 2017-06-30 06:05:29
Well what's the upside when SegWit delivers much more evolution and scale with a soft fork?
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:22:08
LOL! You were done before you started. Your schtick only has a chance with ignorant noobs.
Do you enjoy your time in the 50 cent army?
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:43:11
What is 2047 to the 24th power?  Calculate it.  
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:59:01
Signaling is easy to do quickly. Code changes are not.
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:42:08
Sure thing, Redditor for two weeks.  You're a private in the 50 cent army.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:55:30
Bitcoin is core, core has earned the right to the name, even if they don't have the trademark. There's only one bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:51:34
Watch them!  LOL!  Seriously, though, bitmain doesn't seem to understand this, and I'm curious how things will turn out if there's a split and bitcoin has minority hash power.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:35:29
So calling it open source is dishonest.  This is open code, not open source.
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:16:00
SegWit is not going away. That initial activation method has a timeout, but it can be e tended or changed depending on the needs of the system.
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:05:56
You're knocking down a strawman and ignoring that SegWit is on chain scaling.  Your rant about raspberry pis is disingenuous and irrelevant.  You're reading from a script, and have only succeeded in convincing me you don't understand the technology.
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:41:09
It's not petty to boycott evil people who are trying to take over bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:34:20
If they had activated SegWit as they promised I'd be open to the idea of larger blocks too.  I think SegWit would solve all the problems, but I'm willing to compromise.
This entire experience has been due to one side- Roger Ver and Jihad Wu- being unwilling to compromise and unwilling to move bitcoin forward.
Hell, SegWit itself is a compromise to big blockers, it increases block size as well as makes it more efficient.  Further despite screaming for the last year about high fees while mining empty blocks, SegWit has lower transaction fees for transactions that use less resources-- something Jihad explicitly objected to in his "I'm going to hard fork" press release.
The facts are not in your side, but your side seems immune to facts.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:30:19
What conclusion do you draw from that?
Edit: downvoted for asking question. LOL! 
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:34:48
I mean their service doesn't work.  I don't know which of the many bugs it was that got me.  I don't think they are fraudulent, just incompetent.
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:42:25
UASF is about economic support, not mining support.  Miner blocking progress is the problem being resolved. Miners get to try and win the block. They don't dictate technology.
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:15:17
Yeah, I doubt they did.  
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:29:07
So glad to see that "Jihad" Wu has become a thing.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:48:36
Got details of what you did?  I'm assuming that's not a Ledger Nano in there!
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:39:49
This script is as tired as it is silly. Bitmain can fork off their own chain, but without economic support the hash power is pointless as they nine worthless blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:54:15
These people are not enforcing the law, they are in violation of the constitution.  They are criminals themselves in many cases.  Every prosecutor that puts a drug user in jail is a felon under USC 18-242 &amp; 18-241.
You act as if the law were some objective thing.  It isn't. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:58:42
 Typo software needs many eyes.  You're not wrong and for most software it would be fine, but I would rather more people contributing to the code base to make it more secure.
Imagine if bitcoin had a license that prevented litecoin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:53:30
You're missing the forest for the trees.
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:16:52
True, I think that a more frequently updating difficulty would be a good idea.  Surprised it hasn't been added already as part of the SegWit trigger code.
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:55:20
Yep, I wished I had been able to do the same.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:20:43
When you have %80 hash power, you can activate.  And if they had at least signaled they would have been following their promises.  And if they had signaled, well over %95 would have switched to activate, because really the only reason to oppose SegWit is to preserve ASICBOOST and keep mining fees high- two things that Jihad has admitted.
Your narrative doesn't hold up to scrutiny.  No reason to keep repeating it.  It's not like these facts will change.
You're 50 cent army, right?
