Thanks! I'm already starting, looks like my first couple of tries have gone through.
This is addicting!
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:59:40
Thanks! But totally unnecessary! The thanks/appreciation in the OP is genuine and the bitcoin community itself is gift enough!
Though now I really have no excuse not to get that Coinbase account created... :-)

I have to say, I read a few times and laughed my ass off. Those guys are hilarious.
(I first wrote that they are "so funny" and had to stop myself from doge-ifying the message with a "wow" and a "much jokes".)

It's what the non-fanboy console owners have been saying for a long time: "better" is not an objective term.
PS4, Wii U, and Xbox One all have differences that make them better for different people. As an avid XB1 fan (but not "fanboy", if you know what I mean), I'm more than happy to trade off some graphical fidelity for the media integration, voice, camera, and exclusives.
Others want the most horsepower and don't care about media, and that's OK. Others love what Nintendo offers.
And it's all good. If the new Bitcoin purchasing options on the Xbox tip you over the edge to make it a better console *for you*, then return the PS4 and get an Xbox.
Otherwise, enjoy your PS4 and wait for Sony's inevitable competitive response. It's a good time to be a gamer.

Here, have a small start!
Paying forward some of the kindness in this thread with 500 bits from And, check out the "Getting Started" link in the sidebar of the subreddit.

I know, so much positivity. So cool!

Thanks for your mod work!
EDIT: Thanks to HermanLeon for pointing out my mistake.
Should be 1000 bits.

The "increments" problem is a common one with the MS account, not just limited to Bitcoin (though that makes it a bit worse). It's also not unique to Microsoft, as I've run into the same issue with my Apple iTunes Store account.
Many people (especially unbanked kids and teens) get MS or Xbox gift cards and "deposit" them into their MS account because they can't just link a credit card. These too are in typical gift-card sized increments. A reasonably common question in Xbox forums is, "I have $4.82 in my Microsoft Account, what's the best thing to buy?"
So to clarify, the $0.67 isn't lost - as you say, it's a loan, not a fee. MS expects that customers will make future purchases out of their MS account and eventually "use up" that balance just like you'd do with a gift card. 
Reiterating your point, today's Bitcoin integration lets you deposit into an account. It doesn't let you buy direct. Think of it as buying and depositing a gift card in one transaction, vs. buying a game with Bitcoin.
I'm sure it will just get better from here.

Thanks, hope I can return the favor!

Great question Rlight (a member of the superhero team of xboxone mods).
I see on the reply to [this comment]( that it looks like some people give fake bitcoin tips? Not sure how that works, but FYI.
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:14:10
Interesting example of how a technology doesn't change the importance of trust and credibility when you're dealing with money.
Good lesson to learn early!
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:03:33
Ah, never mind I guess? Interesting post history...
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:31:48
Oops! thanks! (now I need to check all the places I may have mistyped that!)
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:05:12
Thank you sir, and I will use your gift to spread Bitcoin further.
On security, thanks to your message I just clicked over to the [Security guide]( linked in the sidebar. What a great resource.
If there's another security page or "common scam" cheat sheet you'd recommend, I'd love to hear it!
On the rabbit hole, hopefully my long-term experience with PGP and in the security industry as a whole will give me enough familiarity with private keys, fingerprints, and similar concepts that carry over to Bitcoin that the learning curve won't be too steep.

It did not - just set up my account and confirmed that nothing came through.
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:12:39
Realized that after I sent the thank you, but decided to leave it up.
Thanks for letting me know and reporting.
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:11:23
Thanks Revel!


I kind of wish people led with their brain in most things. The world wouldn't be perfect, but we might avoid some of the worst parts.
@_date: 2014-12-12 00:35:41
Thanks! I think the Bitcoin tipping will be fast and furious on for a while - I hope it lasts, it'll be something else that sets the community apart.
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:44:17
Thanks, but I checked my changetip account and it shows that 1000 bits were transfered to XenoBen. 
Maybe it worked because the first line wasn't the /u/ format, and I added a line with the edit instead of changing the original line?
I'll leave it for now and see if picks it up.
Thanks for the help though! 500 bits
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:51:34
Mousini, I hope that real-world karma returns your gifts 100-fold. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-12-12 00:39:55
Thanks noperdd! I'm honored! Today was my first tip too, but definitely not my last.
I checked my changetip account and it says there was a "wallet error" on the transaction from you. I don't know what it means (obviously I'm new at this too), but maybe you can check your changetip account to see if it says something more detailed on the other side?
Here's to keeping this train rolling! 1000 bits back at ya! @_date: 2014-12-11 17:51:57
What the what? I don't even.....thank you!

Thanks Jcoe!


So am I! Here's 1500 bits from spread it around and keep the fun going!
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:19:17
Happy to try!
Here are 1,000 bits back at you! Am I doing it right? (My first tip!)
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:57:37
Honestly I see myself dropping in $20 and using it for Reddit tips more than anything else.
As an investment, the volatility is a bit crazy...but I can't help think that the credibility and momentum from MS (joining other big guys with recent announcements) will cause the value to creep upwards. Slow and steady based on fundamentals is a lot better than wild swings due to speculation. Plus, the infrastructure really has to be getting put in place and tested for it to support high volumes through major sites...
Hmm, maybe I just talked myself into buying more than $20. :-)
@_date: 2014-12-12 00:33:28
You can (just not in Bitcoin). All games can be purchased digitally, and it's almost too easy to drop into the store on the console, buy a game, download it, and start playing.
It's linked to your Microsoft account, so you can either link your account to a stored credit card or "charge it up" with money via a gift card. You can also put a PIN on the account so random kids can't start buying things.
It would be cool to purchase hardware (like extra controllers) from the console and have it shipped, but you can't do that yet.
