What's LN?
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:12:12
Just read up on it, how have I not heard about it until now!? Looks amazing.
@_date: 2014-06-02 11:04:29
Ahahaha. True. Oh well, I think I'll just have to make the BTC myself. Wish me luck.
@_date: 2014-05-29 12:18:24
Thank you. However it has been saying 6 blocks all day.
@_date: 2014-03-02 10:04:02
I have figured it out myself, thanks anyway sk221!
Snippet for those interested:
$btc_price = file_get_contents("
$btc_value = 3;
echo $btc_price * $btc_value;

Just to make this clear, it's not my site I'm just sharing the experiment.

I'd be happy to speak to the investor on Skype and discuss my ideas. I'm just looking for someone to invest ~15 BTC in return for a percentage of the sites profits.
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:49:22
If you're serious I'd be happy to take you up on your offer :)

Thanks for the advice but the only 7 servers I have listed are all the same block height.
Edit: I just switched to a random server and it worked! Thanks mate. Free money $$$$

Yesterday I transferred all of my Bitcoin to a new Electrum wallet and today I downloaded Electron Cash to a different PC. I went through the setup and entered my old Seed for the wallet I transferred all my BTC out of yesterday and unfortunately it says I have 0 BCC? I thought you got 1 BCC for every bitcoin that you owned? Am I doing something wrong?
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:37:10
Yes I understand that but what I said was the entire crypto market itself is bound to Bitcoin. I'll reiterate what I said again; if Bitcoin crashes then every other coin will also crash.
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:05:06
What I meant was this is the biggest drop in USD value terms.. I'm not lying about having BTC since 2011 lmao. I havent been watching the markets like a hawk 24/7 for 7 years though if that's what you're looking for.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:32:16
Because this is the largest drop BTC has ever had, there is no clear levels of support and it's on a consistent down-trend with a few pathetic upticks sprinkled in with hardly any strength. Plus as I mentioned before the miners will eventually pull out as the cost to mine a coin is becoming much higher than the price per coin. It's not looking good although there is still a chance of recovery. I hope Craig Wright is happy because he dogged the boys big-time and the one thing that makes me happy about the situation is that he also screwed his own coin as a result.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:55:50
It could just as easily be the highest price Bitcoin will ever be from this point forward. If it goes much lower the miners will pull out as they are losing money and then the entire crypto market will crash down to absolutely nothing. I hate to be all doom-and-gloom, I've been in Bitcoin since 2011 and would like nothing more than it to recover but at this stage it's looking unlikely to say the least. Regardless, unless it goes &lt;$100 per coin then I will still be in profit :P
I've also been selling large amounts for the past 2 weeks, it was inevitable with Craig Wright and his cronies intentionally crashing the market. Little do they know they will kill their own creation because if Bitcoin dies, every cryptocurrency will die alongside it including their shitty Bcash fork.

Cool man, idc what you think. I sold software back in 2011 and a few people contacted me asking if they could pay for it with Bitcoin so I looked it up as I had never heard of it and said sure why not. I forgot about them until 2013 when I read an article about it and realised I had a lot of money in Bitcoin just stashed away, forgotten about. Then in 2014/2015 I ran a popular Bitcoin gambling website which I made 5% fees from all deposits which ended up giving me a large amount of BTC as a result. I've been incrementally selling them off and buying more with the profits (swing trading) ever since but in the last few weeks I have been selling the majority of them off as it doesn't look good for the BTC market currently.

I was just about to post an angry review of Brawker and their horrible service. Everytime I tried to post my order, it gave me an error. I also submitted 3 different support tickets over the space of 3 days about it and none were answered. Now I know why. RIP..

But if the price goes up and you're holding on Coinapult don't you lose Bitcoin? The way I understand it is you buy 10BTC at $200 so you have $2000 and lock it in. Then lets say the price raises to $1000. Don't you then only have 2BTC? I could be wrong but that's how I'm interpreting it.

Love it

They should at least give him his Bitcoin back. I mean, cmon. Allowing someone to deposit into your exchange and then turning around and requiring them to verify their account or lose their funds is criminal. I get that they would want him to verify the account before withdrawing into fiat currency or even another currency, but not allowing withdrawals of the same currency originally deposited with is just not on.
@_date: 2015-02-17 10:39:45
How exactly will that work? I myself am an owner of the Ledger Wallet (brilliant product, btw). Will it connect to the same wallet as you have on your PC or would it be a different thing? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:43:49
I hate to say that you're right but you're probably right.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:52:51
Jesus Christ that's terrible. Honestly you should sell at least some, if Bitcoin ever does recover (which I'm now highly doubtful of) it will take a very very long time and will most likely never see the highs we saw last year. I'm saying that as someone who has had Bitcoin since 2011. As long as Bitcoin stays above $50 then I will still be in a large profit.
