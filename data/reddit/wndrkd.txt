"History shows that no life, after being born, ever reverses course until death."
I guess we're just jerking off at this rate.

How do these things work? Do you have to wait for your payment to go through?

Why would the price of a bitcoin increase because of the costs? I'm confused.
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:06:40
But BTC is no longer a blockchain-based payment. It's just a store of value now. And the way I see it, the "authorities" in the bitcoin development want to keep it that way.
There are those that tried to maintain its payment capabilities though. I think they are idealistic and visionary people. I think that's the future. I think that's the big picture you're talking about. But I think you're not allowed to talk about those here in this subreddit though.

Why would bigger blocks cause centralization?

If hypothetically, someone from the Philippines want to crowdfund capital for expanding his farming, how would the farmer go about in using Lightning?
It seems that such scenario would fit well in a good payment systen.

Emphasizing cognitive dissonance is definitely a spit on the face. A nasty one that is.

When merchants get scammed, they can have Visa or whatever to answer for them, they probably have insurance for that. Visa (or whatever) must also answer to authorities or government.
