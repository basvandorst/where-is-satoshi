Dunno...watching now...not a bad watch if you're a pedestrian lacking any crypto knowledge.

Personally I think this is one of the big three that will be an absolute game changer.  The other 2 being Amazon and Alibaba.

I see this on here...bubble blah blah.  Yes - many smaller tech companies didn't survive the dot.com bust era but the ones that did...lets say I would have loved to buy Amazon at $5 per share.
