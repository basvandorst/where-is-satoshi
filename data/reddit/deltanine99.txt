Why are people still using these clowns? They still don't know how they managed to lose $5 million BTC from their hot wallet.
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:44:32
might have something to do with the $5 million of BTC stolen from the hot wallet that they still have no idea how it went missing
@_date: 2015-06-15 01:11:32
I wonder if this is to assist in the liquidation of the 202K BTC from MtGox?
@_date: 2015-06-01 14:32:56
how the fuck did you manage to misplace the 202k BTC that you eventually found later?
@_date: 2015-06-15 01:17:06
ka-ching! In one of the MtGox leaks which deanonymized the account holders using details from 2011 leak, Jeremy West, the owner of spendbitcoins was something like the third biggest purchaser of Bitcoins on MtGox. Wow!
@_date: 2015-12-14 01:58:28
nothing like naming your bitcoin exchange after a mountain to instil confidence!

How is bitstamp still solvent?

Why did Andreas leave?
@_date: 2015-12-15 23:50:30
it's all been downhill since resigned
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:40:44
Can you explain how the transaction malleabilty scam worked? How were the failed transactions reissued, was it automatic or a manual process? And shouldn't you know the identity of everyone who withdrew bitcoins, hence also those who took advantage of malleability?
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:44:50
of course he hasn't, he does not want to go to jail. He hasn't commented on anything of significance as to how the coins were actually lost. 
whether he used source control or not, or where his office was, or how many meetings he had he definately has commented about.
@_date: 2015-06-22 00:35:23
also, when Gox imploded the Willy bot stopped
@_date: 2015-06-17 23:44:17
you forgot to add: and possibly insolvent
@_date: 2014-10-10 02:19:13
what, so now you can comment about MtGox?
here is a quote from the book:
"I also had the pleasure of talking to all three 
people protesting at the MtGox office directly. Part of 
my motivation comes from a desire to make sure this 
kind of thing doesn't become necessary again.
 
In contrast, I have attempted repeatedly to 
talk to MtGox, but have had no success. They are 
ignoring me, just like most everyone else."
@_date: 2014-08-25 00:51:16
I lost 171 coins.
I don't think they should have been bailed.
I wish my 171 coins could buy me the answer to:
Was MtGox hacked? How?
How many coins lost by malleability?
How were they lost? Did they really reissue transactions without doublespending the coins in the original txn?
What was Willy's purpose?
Who was behind Willy?
@_date: 2015-05-11 00:39:16
obviously they are a pack of amateurs and are processing withdrawls manually.
A friends withdrawl was stuck pending for over a week (he forgot about it).
When he raised a support ticket the funds were magically released.
Amateur hour... when dealing with money you want things to JUST WORK. he will never use them again.
@_date: 2015-05-20 01:29:50
There is no gag order. he's not talking because he does not want to incriminate himself.
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:36:09
even if he didn't steal them, his incompetence was criminal.
he claims they never reconciled MtGox's Mickey Mouse accounting with the source of truth that is the blockchain.
instead he blindly refilled their hot wallet with the cold storage until it was gone.
then he set up the willy bot to buy back coins to keep the exchange ticking along.
then, when the shit hit the fan he blamed the Bitcoin protocol rather than his own shitty code and processes.
and then, he never had the decency to explain to his users who entrusted their Bitcoin to mtgox what actually happened.
he deserves everything he gets!
@_date: 2015-05-15 00:42:35
yea, why did you never reconcile your genius, handrolled MtGox wallet balances with the actual blockchain?
SO YOU WOULD HAVE NOTICED 850k BTC going missing! 
(to be fair, he did eventually notice, about a year before the bankrupcy, so he started the willy bot to keep the exchange afloat)
@_date: 2015-05-20 01:31:31
Willy and markus were set by him to buy coins to refill to hot wallet so MtGox could keep trading.
The wizsec report says that all the coins were stolen by the beginning of 2013
@_date: 2015-01-24 07:26:36
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:15:14
couldn't run a Bitcoin exchange, now he can't even run a hosting service!
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:16:59
why did he leave blockchain? was he responsible for their recent security issues?
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:36:08
...and its gone!
@_date: 2017-03-08 11:43:29
He claims he had a life changing amount of bitcoin stuck in mtgox, but no bankrupcy claim?
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:31:45
I think this was a desperate attempt by karpeles to sort out all the japanese account holders before the ship went down in order to reduce pressure on him from the japanese government.

the feds? Don't you mean the rogue, crooked agent Shaun Bridges who signed the seizure warrant two days after using MtGox to launder $800k plus of bitcoins stolen from the Silk Road into his company bank account?

Please don't call Tone a filthbag
@_date: 2019-02-05 01:49:43
The willy bot didn't help, but they were definitely hacked.
@_date: 2019-08-27 05:43:11
um, isn't the seed phrase basically a paper wallet. So if you have a fire where your wallet is stored. If it's paper, it's toast.  If its hardware its toast. if the seed phrase was stored on paper its toast.
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:56:19
sounds reliable...
@_date: 2015-08-17 01:14:17
it's because isn't pumping the price by constantly buying coins on his exchange via the willy bot in order to pay out peoples withdrawl requests to keep his insolvent exchage afloat. $100 to $1200 is a few months! That was one hell of a pump!
BTW, hows the inside of that tokyo jail cell, Mark?
@_date: 2015-08-28 07:05:05
how do you know it won't affect customers open postions. 5 million is a lot of money... gox me once...
@_date: 2015-08-02 00:45:23
or the bitstamp incident report
@_date: 2015-08-27 23:45:15
who's punishing Bitstamp for losing $5 million... amateurs!
@_date: 2015-08-10 04:11:01
because Mark Karpeles is not longer manipulating the market via MtGox
@_date: 2015-07-31 01:10:36
yea, neglected the single most important duty a bitcoin exchange could have, which was to actually know how many bitcoin they had.
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:35:45
um, i don't think he can logon to reddit from a tokyo jail cell!
@_date: 2015-07-22 07:52:06
Karpeles will never pay back his loans. He won't even tell us what happenned!
@_date: 2015-07-22 00:22:42
you must have missed that bit where the price ran up to $1200 USD over a few months...
@_date: 2015-08-30 10:17:50
if only he took as much care with his accounting, security and general corporate governence as he did with his apple pie recipe!
@_date: 2015-08-10 00:56:37
Welcome to bitcoin!
How do youthink the people who bought at $1200 feel?
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:07:13
Did he read a prepared speech to camera about how they were definately solvent?
@_date: 2015-07-06 00:47:25
come on,
the blockchain is a public ledger. Seriously it is trivial to reconcile the balances held in your shitty PHP excahnge accounting system with the source of truth that is the blockchain. Karpeles failure to do even the most basic accounting meant he didn't notice his losses for months or years later. 
Not incompetant - he is criminally negligent.
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:46:18
That makes sense...
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:08:19
sold my holdings for fiat during the boom to $1200.
on MtGox :(
@_date: 2015-07-31 01:11:50
when did the fed seize $30M?
@_date: 2019-04-22 09:54:22
Stupidly complicated
@_date: 2015-07-06 00:57:25
hmmm, they lost 5 million in BTC.
spent nearly $1 million recovering from the hack.
And accrued about $2 million USD in lost business and reputational damage.
So, do they have enough money to cover the losses?
Plus their sysadmin was such a cowboy he opened a malware infected word document from a stranger on the internet that p0wned his laptop, and their internal security was so shitty that hackers were able to steal the wallet.dat file.
Does this sound like a company you would like to do business with?
@_date: 2016-02-15 01:46:14
even if he is not satoshi... it's still pretty interesting.
He has his own supercomputer for running bitcoin simulation, 
he bootstrapped a started in Sydney "Hotwire PE" with bitcoin,
tried to claim a massive gst refund at the tourist refund scheme desk at Sydney airport regarding a bitcoin transaction
claims to have over 1 million btc in an offshore trust
@_date: 2019-04-16 05:09:30
@_date: 2016-02-17 00:19:06
No your claim was in JPY, all other currencies and BTC were converted  to JPY when you lodged your claim.
@_date: 2019-04-16 04:37:44
yes, he reused the  message "Gavins favourite number is 11. CSW" which satoshio signed.
@_date: 2019-04-16 04:39:04
unless the trust document in Ira Kleimans lawsuit is fake, Kim Nielssen pretty much debunked all the addresses in that trust of ever belonging to Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-04-11 06:45:43
Wow! I remember another exchange that froze fiat withdrawals. That ended well...
@_date: 2015-04-21 03:46:17
of course he knew. That's why he created willy. 
All the bitcoins were stolen, he needed coins to keep the exchange ticking over, so he set up willy to buy coins with fake money, knowing perfectly well that no one could with draw that money that was paid for their coins.
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:17:39
surely they don't need to liquidate. they could just value the btc at the market price to calculate the value in jpy. then distribute in btc to those that want btc , then liquidate the remainder
@_date: 2015-04-23 23:06:35
it depends how many exchanges are run by people as incompetent and/or criminal as @_date: 2015-04-20 10:28:13
yes, I'm much more inclined to believe the man who lost 200k BTC down the back of his couch and never figured out how to double check his wallet balances with the blockchain...
@_date: 2015-04-23 23:12:09
yes, perhaps was sick of running MtGox and needed an exit strategy. Just forget about a lazy 200k BTC lying around in a cold wallet, sounds about right for someone so incompetent that they could not reconcile MtGox's BTC holdings with the blockchain.
An exit strategy that made him the most hated man in bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-04-01 00:22:31
Theft? Who says it was theft? missing, temporarily unavailable but no one has every presented any evidence of theft...
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:16:57
yeah, that way only 0.001% of people interested in your art will know how to pay for it.
@_date: 2015-04-14 03:17:25
"this incident was significant if only for the fact that Bitstamp remained solvent and fulfilled all of their financial commitments to their customers"
I wonder how long for?
@_date: 2015-04-22 07:04:13
why would you bother trying to claim less than half a cent ?
@_date: 2015-11-23 00:37:27
There was a a Yubikey based bitcoin wallet. It was called MtGox :(
@_date: 2015-10-07 23:09:17
theyve been holding from $1200 all the way down!
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:32:54
Oh, the reasons are far too complicated to explain on the Bitcoin sub reddit.
Bullshit! Satoshi told me that he is HODLing till we hit the moon, he's not selling till the price hits $10k!
@_date: 2016-05-20 00:19:52
honestly, he knew he was fucked which is why he didn't want to reconcile the balances. You can look up the balance on blockchain.info if you know the address. Or if that was too hard he could have just written down the balance on the piece of paper used for the paper wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-23 23:34:36
Maybe they should try and figure out how they got robbed
@_date: 2015-10-05 22:56:10
I recently opened accounts with these guys, and the best feature was I could deposit over the counter and buy my bitcoins an hour later.
The australian banks are running scared- they are closing just about every bitcoin business down by closing their acocunts.
@_date: 2015-10-19 23:42:07
I opened an account with Btcmarkets and bittrade and was required to verify with my drivers license, passport and electoral roll registration, and I couldn't trade until I received a activation code via snail mail. That sems pretty strong KYC to me.
@_date: 2015-10-07 01:27:58
plausible, but if you reissue a transaction you are supposed to double spend the same inputs as the previous transaction.
Which makes malleability a non-issue
@_date: 2015-10-26 23:28:14
Why isn't on that list?
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:50:09
Biggest mistake was getting caught with his encypted laptop open and hence unencrypted.
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:10:12
it wasn't his code, belive it or not. The thief copied the wallet.dat file off the gox server. 
karpeles just never checked the balance, probably because he already knew gox was insolvent by 80k BTC when he bought it off McCaleb
@_date: 2016-07-15 06:32:54
because reconciling your cold wallet balances against the blockchain is  mendokusai
@_date: 2016-07-19 00:17:38
yeah, considering it took him a couple of weeks to "find" 202k BTC in a cold wallet, I wonder how many other cold wallets he might have found.
@_date: 2016-07-19 00:15:59
What's it like in a Japanese jail?
@_date: 2019-05-07 02:51:49
are you seriously compaining about a 0.003 % fee?
@_date: 2019-05-07 02:52:59
BTC is shit for small purchases, the fees are too high
@_date: 2016-07-15 06:29:42
why would he mine bitcoin when he could just steal them?
