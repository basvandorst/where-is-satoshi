Did the exchange you were using have your identification information (kyc/aml?) If so, then they are in someway connected to the US financial laws and will likely report all exchanges over a certain amount to (I think 3k) to the IRS. (assuming you are in the USA)

Good for you. Do you also claim a conspiracy every time you jump on the highway during rush hour? I am not disagreeing with the fact that fees are high at this moment in time. It certainly is, I am certainly paying the fees just as you are when I am moving money around ( though I am limiting my movements because I have no reason to move anything other than newly purchased btc into cold storage).
But you could move multiple input tx just before this latest round of the attack for &lt;$1 at the most with a few hours even with multiple inputs...so to think that just because fees are high during rush hour that they will continue to be so once lightning comes on board is disingenuous, and is a false fee narrative.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:56:15
LN literally was demoed with subcent tx fees. Get real, the future is here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:28:35
I personally like moving that money to gdax first, then withdrawing so those assholes pay that fee for my $10 as a personal fuck you for not prioritizing segwit over a coordinated bch attack on bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:35:55
srsly. for a 140 character quick opinion rant, there's Twitter. for everything else there's Reddit ffs
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:22:07
Didn't you hear the LN news? What will happen when everyone supports segwit and L2 eliminates the high fees? How are they gonna fixes BCH's fundamental problem of not being Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:53:19
Bitcoin had a stellar week, and SEVERAL appearences on nightly news, cable news, financial shows, and even a mention on the big bang theory. 10 days ago was also Thanksgiving.
It takes the average person a few days to learn about Bitcoin, and somewhere between 7-15 days to get their ACH's to clear.
The horde is coming.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:37:57
you hodl until you no longer have to sell, because bitcoin will have won, and there is no such thing as selling.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:30:27
If you truly believe that a 70m dollar loan would be able to compromise a company who has less than a handful of actual core devs, and be able to drive the narrative - what do you have to say about nTrust aquiring Fake Satoshis businesses and patents, and ultimately teaming up with a 500 billion dollar Japanese financial conglomerate to push bcash and big-block ideas and patents?
Jesus, the fact you rubes can't see past your own nose is exhausting.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:12:25
Is it a Problem? Sure. Is the problem anywhere near the magnitude that the other sub is making it out to be? Nope.
Knowing how that sub operates though... I can tell you that they probably Mass submitted complaints about it
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:03:24
Consider that we now have hostile actors in our midst (CEOs of exchanges pushing for particular forks, Mining cartels colluding and pushing for their own fork, etc) - it would seem to me that we will never be able to achieve consensus ever in the future since they are still participants in this game, unless something in the dynamic changes. Couldn't they (the bad actors) just conceivably just ALWAYS go against consensus?
My only hope at this point is the healthy increase in full nodes that are supportive of the roadmap we are currently on, as well as the dragonmint miners brining more competition and as a result better decentralization to the mining side of things.
If they can truly open source the asic designs, even if the miners are slighly less efficient than Bitmains, the sheer volume of new miners we could bring into the field by creating a competetive miner manufacturing industry and lowering the cost of asic miners would allow for many more users to participate as miners again and perhaps we can reach majority consensus without those hostile actors once more.
Do I have this scenario accurately described?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:15:37
Its called brigading, and its pretty frowned upon...not that I think they care.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:26:49
Imagine when the real gift card craze will hit, people gifting small amounts of btc to others...and we know that millions of dollars go unspent in retail already with gift cards (part of retails obsession with them! Free Money!).
Between lost coins, and coins nobody cared to redeem the last few years, and in the coming couple of years before 1 btc = 1 million and they essentially throw away hundreds of thousands of dollars or forget about them, lambasting away in some decrepit coach purse in grandmas attic...
Holy shit. Buy, buy, buy boys! This shit will forever be a shrinking pool of money, and the more of it your own, the richer you will become! (I hope!)
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:35:26
Alright boys! Lets good a good ole fashion pump and dump going...get the telegram up, and we'll push this baby skyhigh - get all those non-crypto investors hyped, and then pure profit baby!
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:25:42
Gifts are literally untaxed up to $14k per person per year, and anything beyond that is STILL tax free but must be REPORTED and subtracted from your ~5million dollar lifetime gifting cap (that is a cap for REPORTED funds). I don't think anyone is giving him over 5 million dollars, so doubt anyone is paying any gift tax.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:02:24
I don't think you understand how it all works. and that's okay...i won't need to convince you. btc will
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:37:30
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:58:24
if all of the bitcoin nodes and mining were under the control of one man, say Roger Ver, would you think it wise to invest in it, considering that one entity controls 51% of the hashpower and the consesus giving nodes?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:40:05
Not saying it isn't frustrating. I know it is, and I'm paying the high fees during the crazy times of high congestion too. Its painful for everyone, but there is an obvious coordinated attack happening to make it painful. And yes, I agree we should be fit to deal with state level attacks even. Its unfortunate, but when we include hostile actors in the consent mechanism, it is near impossible to move forward. The only solution I see to it is the opensourcing of the dragonmint asic designs, and complete reversal of the trend of miner centralization so that the miners and exchange CEOs can no longer collude to prevent progress.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:26:09
I mean, by that measure neither is your bank password or your credit card number, and those control vastly larger amounts of consumer cash than bitcoin at the moment. There is definitely some improvement that can be made in this space as regards BTC, but lets not pretend that what we have here is an illusion of security...its just as secure, if not more, than the standard.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:23:10
I may have taken some liberty with that war exaggeration. 
I was merely adding some color to my commentary...but you would think with the way the BCH brigade came in and responded that they believe it wholeheartedly.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:12:32
Because I'd rather not trust my money to a network that is literally in the hands of three dictators and a mining cartel who could easily decide that my money is their money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:39:26
to add to this coinbase covers the fee if withdrawn from gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:08:28
If any entity controls more than 51% of all hashpower, it makes it possible for them to propogate a chain of fake transactions. You can see how that would be a problem. Its not a definite thing, but anything over 51% makes it that much more likely of an occurrence.
Kind of the same concept with the nodes - the nodes are the ones that are distributing the ledger as well as the transactions that are waiting to be processed into the ledger. They can decide which transactions "follow the rules." because they are decentralized across many many people, the rules are those that are arrived at through the consensus of all of those people.
Now, imagine that the government has all of this in their control. They could decide that particular tx's are not valid, or someones address, or some other form of censorship. They could decide that a transaction you've done was illegal, and reverse it or worse confiscate it.
Decentralization is what makes bitcoin, and any cryptocurrency really, better than other forms of money. We all have to play by the rules for it to work right, otherwise just stick to paypal lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:17:16
what an asinine assessment.  After this latest tx spam attack dies down, along with the panic the BCH team has created in the space begins to fade...and the blocks go back down to where they were like last week even...fees will be back down in the $0.1-$.2 range and for every lightning channel that opens, and tx moving off chain, the fees will continue to drop until there will no longer be a reason to pay anywhere near high fees because the vast majority of congestion will have left the on-chain network.
I literally paid $0.12 in fees just before this latest backup of tx to move a large amount of money. The fee narrative is getting very fucking tired.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:21:46
If you guys don't think the sub which will not be mentioned has not been brigading their support with bogus fee complaints, I've got news for you. This is a war after all...
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:58:04

He'd actually have to develop something meaningful if he worked on btc.
Can't just copy/paste like he is used to
@_date: 2017-01-07 15:43:08
Guy with the usb comment below should work I think.  If not try:
1)Go to thrift store/craigslist.buy shitty old computer.
2)try using software called Recuva to restore files from the hdd without having to mount both. The RAW data is still on the disk...just whatever you do DO NOT write over it, as you may lose some data.
3)try a Linux boot cd, and see if you can access files from linux
 
@_date: 2017-01-28 15:23:23
The buyer only lost any amount if he paid more for the coins than they were worth at the time of contract, that's why
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:06:01
because it would be himself, funding himself.
How do you launder millions of dollars of stolen BTC? Make it look like legitimate funds that came in through an ICO. 
OOPS! Our ICO failed, sorry everyone*! No Refunds!
*there is no everyone.

"if you can't *hodl* me"
there fixed it for you
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:02:35
but it doesn't legitimize the source
 like this they could claim official income, and no could prove otherwise
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:08:03
Now you understand why the miners have been colluding to prevent L2 solutions.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:14:37
lol ok bud. vote of no confidence on the 'other' code. everyone can see the repos and contributions
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:45:10
probably because they have no intention of actually ensuring its success; its literally just a pump and dump.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:35:18
and then the first bug will be found and garzik will be like  "core please help us!"
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:18:35
Yes, and then he got together with those 5 other loud voices and they decided to cancel the thing that had this enormous amount of consensus they had just been boasting about. Find Rear. Insert Head.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:35:04
and with that same overwhelming consensus, 6 people called it all off. 
how anyone didn't see it before that is laughable.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:47:30
Ps, if you can't understand that they forked, removed support to allow people to dump to a low low price, and then bought in majorly when it was in the 2xx's so they could pump the price and then sell at a massive proft...I don't know what to tell you.
Wait! Actually, I do - Have you heard about Bcash Classic? Its the true bcash coin, true to its original vision...
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:32:29
The VAST VAST majority of folks I give a true intro to crypto to still don't know that you don't have to buy 1 whole coin.
If you truly want to make a difference, lets get a guerrilla marketing campaign going, and plaster stickers letting the plebs know.
Every single person I've explained this to has bought their first coins within the next 30 minutes.

Does Costco copy the logos, color schemes, general layout of the Walmart stores? Are they Called Walmart plus or any other number of shitty alt coin names they've tried to attack btc with? Do they put up street signs on the street corner directing people to "Walmart" because Costco has better prices, so it should be called Walmart anyway?
Fuck outta here shill.

Heres your first advice:
I've also recently seen an a simple add-on that someone put out to help you get exchange info directly
This will likely be enough for your needs for a few days/weeks - but if you are anything like me you will eventually start researching how to write your own custom functions in google scripts.
Good luck!
