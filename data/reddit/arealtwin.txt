bad move to sell, coinbase is doing you a favor.

Alright lets see if I can take a stab at this.  Please keep in mind that I do have opinions about each of these, but am trying to be as non bias as I can be.  I apologize if anything is wrong.
ASICBoost: A protocol inside of some ASICs miners that provides power efficiency.  This is a patented process in the US and China.  It can be utilized on the current blockchain but would lose much of its power in a USAF to SegWit. 
SegWit: Adding additional transactions to blocks, among other improvements.  Would increase block size to 2mb or 4mb, I think... 
Lightning: A side chain used to quickly transact bitcoins
BU: A group of developers that support bitcoin advancements and fixes bugs.  They are made up of a team much like other software companies.  Uses Emergent consensus to change the size of blocks, allowing for bigger blocks when needed, and shrinking down when its not.  They are the opposite side of the coin to Core. 
Core: A group of developers that support bitcoin advancements and fixes bugs.  They are made up of a team much like other open source software.  They general support a USAF (User Activated Soft Fork?)  to allow SegWit and Lightning network.  They are the opposite side of the coin to BU

if you just let it ride, it may be worth a lot more one day.  That said we all make mistakes, and I might be the one making one right now.

Thank you! The UsAF vs UASF threw me for a loop, I thought it was UASF, but am dyslexic so just assumed I messed it up. :0

I believe that is also what bullets are...

lol I am not mixing up mining and nodes.  Without mining your node means nothing.  Regardless I am saying the cost is minimal compared to mining, also say it is minimal if you are denominating your wealth in bitcoin regardless of country of origin.  The increase in value of BTC far exceeds that of the increase in cost of more data, at this point.  Not to mention the negative price pressures on the cost of hardware.  And if you are running a node, but $50 is a lot more than the BTC you hold, then I would say you might be kind of buying the saddle before the horse.  That is just my opinion though, and like asshole everyone has one.

If you can't afford $50 a year for more diskspace how exactly are you going to afford several thousand a year in mining equipment?  840 GB over 2 years does not seem like a whole lot compared to the advancements in storage... Seems like a weak argument.  Not to mention that you are talking about rich countries, if you buy into bitcoin the country you are from should make little to no difference. 
That said have an upvote for math!

What an over reaction.  It costs like $.50 for transaction fees.  It is such a small issue, but is brought up like its some sort of huge deal.  Yes I understand we want to bring down fees, but to say that the fees are so hard it's not easy to send or transact in bitcoin is disingenuous.  What we thought bitcoin would be in 2011 might not be what it has become, we might not be able to service 3rd world countries as easily right now, but if we keep plugging away we will build out the infrastructure.

RSK will not make Ethereum redundant, but a derivation after RSK might.  Ethereum is considerably more powerful than RSK.  I am not a crypto purist, I love bitcoin, but I also love ETH and ETC, I love anything that comes out that is slightly different.  The OP is right, some of that will be incorporated, some will not, and the competition in the market place will help to drive more innovation.  I think bitcoin is the strongest crypto, and I see it being that way in the long term, but I think there will always be a place for Ethereum, or Digibyte or Monero or Expanse or Ripple.  This is the biggest transformation in financial tech in a century, there is a lot of room in this market place.

right... was not really the krux of the argument but I do agree with you, nodes are meaningful.
