My email address was in a few leaks and the passwords weren't even close to anything I've ever used.

Right. I generated a new address for this so I don't really care.

Yes, I tried the free trial. A lot of it the items in the playlist are just streams of downloaded torrents, it shows the file names.  Almost 50% of the content is in Italian. A lot of the UK channels have terrible audio quality and about half of the USA streams don't work at all.
This service does not seem legitimate, even slightly. You could be paying for it and it could go offline at any time, and you'd be screwed.

Read this: 
Close Bitcoin-QT, download that torrent and move the file where it needs to go after the download finishes. Restart Bitcoin-QT and let it do it's thing. It'll be a nice jumpstart.  Although where you are now, it might be better just to wait it out.

If you're smart about it, Whole Foods really isn't that much more than other grocery stores.  Produce at the store near me is almost the same price as Meijer and Kroger.  Now there are a lot of things at Whole Foods that really are expensive.  Meat and organic products, for sure.  $7/lb for chicken is insane.

I've been using Amazon Payments as an alternative to PayPal lately when friends or family owe me money since everyone has an Amazon account. Haven't been charged any fees yet. I've tried to get them to use bitcoin but they just don't have the interest in learning. I don't know if they operate in Europe though. 
Edit: it looks like Amazon Payments is available in Germany and the UK. Can't really test if it works elsewhere though.

They should just say that they're accepting NFC payments. In my experience, the ISIS terminals work just fine with Google Wallet payments.  I have read that some block Wallet payments deliberately but I haven't experienced that yet.

If you can't use USAA (need a military family member), check out Ally. Any ATM (fees reimbursed at the end of the month), online check deposit and no minimum balance. Automatic transfers from savings to prevent overdrafts is nice too.
