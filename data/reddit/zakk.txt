You are very wrong, those commands give away only publicly available data (usage statistics about the BTC network), feel free to read the program description in case you don't know how it works.
And please stop, your are implying that I'm trying to to something shady while I am not.

Unknown to you, doesn't mean unknown to everyone. And, btw, ignorance is the mother of all conspiracy theories, just a coincidence?
I am assuming people here should know this program, some time ago a user here in posted some nice graphs obtained using blockparser's data. I am not asking anyone who didn't use the program before, and is not confident with it, to install it now for me.


Anyway, I updated my request. Now shut up.

I tried doing everything you suggest. Thank you for NOT asking, and supposing.


You completely misunderstood (or didn't bother to understand) the purpose of the program. Who is incompentent now?


You have not bothered to read the program description, in which it's clearly stated that the program is about ***statistical data*** and ***public data***. The same data you can find, in a different format, at blockchain.info.
Think whatever you want, just make it clear that ***your suppositions are not supported by actual evidence***.
I may be a serial killer or a NSA spy, of course, just make it clear it's your ignorance or your conspiracy theory.

That's a good idea. However the blockparser is pretty memory-intensive, the blockchain is 9GB IIRC and the program takes some other GBs to run... I have a couple of Vagrant VMs set up on my MacBook Pro, but it's not going to work... 
And also the errors on Mac OS X (Bus error: 10) could be related to memory shortage, I should investigate...

Thank you very much! That one should do the trick! Thanks again!
