RARI OR BUST BABY LETS GO LIGHTWEIGHT 
But it is relaxing to have a quiet spell

Have you ever bought something that has depreciated in value just because you wanted to enjoy it? And why would you buy a new car instead of a used one? Also, maybe these people already have a house or flat and are debt free, you never know

But. I have to say. The hype is fun.

I completely agree about not buying a brand new car with zero miles on it, but did he say it was used or new? I might have missed it. If it's used and he didn't spend the majority of his finances on it and can comfortably pay for food, clothes, a place to live and so on, then I can't see anything wrong with using the disposable income, of which he would get the majority back in a few years. I guess it comes down to a choice between retiring early or purchasing nicer things. But buying a showroom new car when you don't have a place to live of your own or are in debt is not that good an idea, I'll agree

I may have missed the 2030 part. Still crazy to hear the difference between countries though

Did this guy get a car with zero miles on it? If it was used then I don't understand the hate he's getting, the bulk of the depreciation will already have happened
