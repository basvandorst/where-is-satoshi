Sounds to me like it's already been thought of and currently is not a technical limitation but a safeguard measure **scheduled to be lifted** once the community is ready for it. This prevents premature ballooning of the blockchain size.

Yes, we're talking Game Theory though. Petabytes massive isn't out of reach for the inclined and connected. But, I guess that's the question -- how big for what probability, given you can attempt it again and again at the beginning of every round.

Not to come off as rude, but by definition this isn't a bubble. If the price started jumping up, up, up -- *then* you could speculate it to be a bubble. ~5$ has been a stable price for quite some time now.

I sincerely think this is counterproductive to blackout anything related to the Bitcoin project &amp; advise against it. Bitcoin isn't mainstream. Let me say that again: Bitcoin is **not** mainstream. It's a safe assumption that the majority of Bitcoin adopters at this (early) stage are not the target audience that we're trying to demonstrate through these website blackouts. 
**Bitcoin is a response to failing centralized systems.** I think there are more productive ways we can use "website blackout day" to promote the alternatives.

While this is an excellent idea, you won't have anyone other than extreme risk takers working anything more than small jobs that pay in Bitcoin. The problem is that this economy is still **microscopic** compared to the economies it's bootstrapping to. I would suggest instead, that *early adopters* and those with deep BTC pockets, **as well as** those who don't have much pony up bounties to see the development of applications and infrastructure to further ease the trading convenience of Bitcoin.
This is how it was from the start; This is how you're going to see growth -- the technology is there. What do we need most now, more than ever? We need developers.

If Tradehill ended up winning AND investing its settlement into Bitcoin, it would actually have largely positive repercussions. Not only would it be a triumph to the BTC economy, re-opening one of the few bridges to "Bitcoin-island," but it would also fuel $2,000,000 worth of invested infrastructure. 
Regardless of where it goes, it's a plus, so long as it goes into the BTC economy. They could use that capital to potentially pay for **professional** programmers/engineers to tackle some of the larger problems the BTC community faces.

This subreddit isn't for Bitcoin market speculation. Please keep posts like this off the subreddit.
@_date: 2012-04-02 15:36:13
While this is an overall good thing, the market cap of Bitcoin is *not high enough yet* to promote a stable economy. It will continue to scale as more and more capital is invested into the economy. Until we reach a point where any one (extremely) wealthy person or interest group cannot sway the market too violently, *then* I will say we can achieve true stability.
I would argue that the main reason behind the lack of violent swing in the market has to do with other factors, such as big players not seeing anything huge on the near horizon &amp; thus, you see little change. This is just purely speculation though, as 90% of people here have an expert degree in wannabe economics.

The problem with this is that it's largely an idealistic system with no regard for capital gain being realized as a means of economic propellant. Simply, there *has* to be a reward in any system in order for it to be successful. Idyllic talk is good for "rallying the people behind a unifying cause" but the fact of the matter is that on a global scale (which Bitcoin is designed to scale to, years from now,) there needs to be an incentive to drive active participants. 
There needs to be *some* kind of lasting and reliable incentive that would make someone want to consciously give even a single CPU cycle to the system.

@_date: 2012-06-08 19:02:16
I'm obliged to clarify that this price window has proven to be vastly more stable. Hindsight being 20/20, the price bubble of June 2011 was just that -- a bubble.
I believe that the price has shown stability at ~5 USD for the past few months. The fact that BTC was trading at "six times the conversion rate" does not mean that value was true to its worth. Market swings make people do the illogical things.

This is the great thing about Bitcoin -- it has enough flexibility built in that you have the ability to build systems on top of it (such as a registration database of employees' BTC addresses) or you can trade completely off the grid. 
A currency would never have governmental backing if they weren't able to reliably meter and tax it, if even at an acceptable operating level. I think in the next few years we're going to see adoption and continued exposure for new systems, such as the Bitcoin. 
It may take on a different form, but the system innovations of the block chain are here to stay, folks.

It's showing market depth for buy and sell orders. The green line represents the price as it swings. The orange line represents the buy offers, while the blue line represents the sell offers. They converge around a single point, which is going to be what your "price of Bitcoin" is.

Your occupation is irrelevant in the matters of having vision. Even if you don't agree with it, don't squelch it. Long before the people who walked onto this project with little more than dollar signs in their eyes, there were true enthusiasts who saw a system that showed promise. 
The system will fail if we don't continue to have developers and innovation, improving the security and ease of use for the good of all. Unfortunately, most of the demographic in this subreddit consist of people asking why the price goes up and down &amp; little more. When the people stop caring, the project begins to lose direction.

Every node has an identical copy of the entire Blockchain. Every single block has transactions between addresses encapsulated within it, with the first entry in the block being 50 Bitcoin to the node that mined that block. Your wallet parses this Blockchain, matching it's receiving addresses' private keys with the public keys in the Blockchain, totaling them &amp; giving you your balance. 
Every node has the ability to look at the Blockchain and verify that your address did in fact have ownership of that Bitcoin (looks like a hash.) and thus is a valid transaction.

I think the two points you mean to make as an argument against fracturing only further the issue. If there is exchange competition, that is only slashing their own profit margins by staying competitive, much like neighboring gas stations. Arbitrage between the markets only seems to me that will act as a stabilizing agent to price spikes. If all markets go up, their incentive is to follow each other closely, so as not to lose percentage one way or the other. Correct me if I'm mistaken, please.
@_date: 2011-06-21 12:56:51
You're stating a point that is all but completely moot in this circumstance, sir. The fact that the coin belonging to you will spend how you see fit is an obvious truth. Please don't waste my time or yours by quibbling or causing a kerfuffle over some scary Internet man telling you to do this or that. 
See the commonality in the people that use Bitcoin. This isn't just a game where you have no ties to what goes on in the community. **Everything you do affects us all** so do not belay the issue by saying something so obvious. If your plan all along is to mine coin and sell them off to an existing currency (USD) then you do nothing for the economy that built your wealth. Yes, you still have a responsibility whether you'd like to admit it or not.

What if the reason for not mining isn't from an economic standpoint? What if there is some form of political pressure, or other means? Playing devil's advocate, can the Bitcoin system stand up to drastic network hash-power loss?

This is a well thought out recap from MtGox.

We as a community need to drive **proper architectural development** to see the BTC mature and grow in the most beneficial way.

It's a two way street. Companies will only bear the hassle of dealing in a currency if it shows to be profitable for them. it *starts* on the market exchange. Then companies see that the currency is holding value and thus trend to provide a service or good for it. 
The fact that the bitcoin is deflating right now (rapidly) means two things. Companies cannot provide a service on a static value of bitcoin-&gt;USD because of the explosive change in price. The other is that venture capitalists are coming in by word of mouth (forbes, CNN, etc etc) and buying up BTC...driving up the price &amp; overall market spread. 
All signs point to *good* ...historically, the bitcoin hasn't gone down and stayed down -- it's only been going up up up.

You misunderstand. I don't mean to imply they manipulative numbers. I mean that by simply having as strong a market presence, people naturally looked to them as the authoritative answer to how much their BTC was worth. This is a problem...one source should never EVER be the single answer to what BTC is worth. 
If there were 100+ exchanges running the same open-source exchange software and perhaps a number of 'supernodes' that tallied ALL of their price reports together and made a weighted answer to how much it should trade for...that would potentially be a much more robust system.

This is precisely right. Just because the market cap was around there **does not** imply that 210 million USD were converted into Bitcoin. People, it was a bubble. It is decidedly back to around it's actual value now that "tulip mania" has since run its course. 
@_date: 2011-05-10 15:10:34
There was a pie chart I looked at (can't remember which BTC statistic site) that shows the total "system" computational power distribution. About 1/4 of the total BTC mining power comes from DeepBit...another ~1/4 comes from Slush.....a small margin are other pool competitors....and ~50% are other people, trying to solo mine. So yes, you could definitely find your own blocks...but it seems that DeepBit is  gaining a TON of momentum...and the faster you're able to find a block - the quicker you can capitalize on the ONE block the system releases every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2011-05-04 18:28:16
What if it worked on a partial assumption of the current number of blocks/transactions? More simply put - a computed hash of the hashes to make sure it checks out, instead of going through each block one by one to make the chain.

Give me an example of ANY system in existence that didn't need special care and attention to ensure it made it from infancy into a mature system. It CAN work and that success is heavily contingent on the community backing behind it. 
Before you power-miners came on the scene, we were a smaller but growing community that cared more about the principles behind the BTC, rather than simply hoarding and dollar amounts. We have a vision that decentralized currency can revolutionize the world and change the balance of power that grips society today.
You look at it as though it's a system to game -- immediate monetary value and nothing more. Sir, that mentality is what will kill the coin. You destroy the faith in the BTC and look only to what value you can capitalize from it.

This rant makes no sense at all other than the last statement: "Expect the rush to Bitcoin to be nothing short of world changing."

This is correct. People need to stop seeing Namecoin as a currency simply because it utilizes a similar blockchain technology as Bitcoin. The project was created out of a need for decentralized DNS management &amp; that is exactly what NMC does. 
There is a definite distinction between the "stock market" of the good/service &amp; the economy of the good/service itself. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 16:19:32
What if we could use the open-source nature of the block-chain technology present in the Bitcoin project to somehow manage and record trade data? Namecoin has successfully taken off and was built directly off of Bitcoin's source -- what we need are fresh ideas for a fully decentralized operation.

Would you be concerned if there was a rising power that took away your ability to tax people, control prices &amp; throw their weight around? That goes beyond just the USA...that becomes a global issue. Think big scale - this isn't going to be just American government.

You cannot throw your hands up in the air and do nothing but say "if it works, then it works" ...the success of this system is **absolutely contingent** on its users helping it along. Perhaps when I say this, I'm not speaking to the everyday merchants and end users of the coin. Perhaps I speak to the developers and architects. **We need infrastructure**...we need an open forum to get this boat turned in a positive direction **and fast**. 
Hoarders, your coin will be worthless if you don't have these systems in place. You cannot turn a blind eye and just sit on your coin and expect it to increase in value. The value of the BTC is directly proportional to the stability of the systems we put in place to manage our commerce and community. I would ask that those rich in Bitcoin would place bounties in the Bitcoin forum (marked with **[BOUNTY]**) tags to get these systems coded, tested and deployed. THIS is your investment....invest into the infrastructure right now -- we desperately need it.

This is a good check method, since all posts like these do is create negative/positive hype. Anyone could hypothetically make a post with numbers that line up *just enough* to be believable. 
When it's in a trusted community like it creates an idea for people to buy or sell *solely* based on a large move order to come, like the OP.

Clearly you haven't read up on Paypal's stance on Bitcoin. If you've been around since the beginning, there were tons of reports of Paypal freezing assets even remotely involved with Mt Gox or even the very hint of Bitcoin.
It's like Blockbuster trying to ban anything Netflix....direct competition to their market.

It looks quite grim for Namecoin as well, considering the huge lack of support from the developer since its inception. 
What I really hope for is another fork altogether that addresses the major issues of Namecoin as well as a fully released code base approach.  The block chain is strong and decentralized DNS is bound to happen in the future, it's a shame a good proof of concept had to be shot in the foot.

Sir, *insight* is entirely perception.
This is related to the technical and economic implications of the introduction of an innovating technology to the fledgling economy. I'm sorry, but if you don't find that an insightful question to your standards then I question if you find the notion of the *Bitcoin* insightful at all, considering the Bitcoin is to traditional currency what an ASIC miner is to a traditional GPU miner.

This needs more visibility. Because Bitcoin and Namecoin both operate on the same encryption algorithm scheme, every calculated hash can be checked against more than a single network (e.g. Bitcoin, Namecoin, Devcoin, etc.) 
The Namecoin project is inherently different from Bitcoin, utilizes the blockchain technology in a uniquely different way &amp; in my opinion should *not* be tied to a blockchain devoted to managing currency (Bitcoin.) 
The problem is simple economics. The same way that mining difficulty "magically" finds equilibrium somewhere slightly above operating costs to mine, there always has to be *incentive*. If I make **1.00** Bitcoins per month by mining exclusively for Bitcoin, but had the potential to make **1.09** Bitcoins per month by adding negligible overhead onto my mining operation, that's free income. Merged mining makes bootstrap systems like Namecoin possible &amp; I would shake the hand of the person who came up with it.

I've done some limited homework on Ripple thus far &amp; to me, it seems that XRP (Ripple "currency") is **not designed to be traded as an alt currency**. It's intent seems to act as a "stamp" to send your package across its network...your "package" being your Bitcoins, USD, or whatever else. 
Someone please correct me if I have that wrong, but please try to keep it to an empirical and positively charged discussion.

Simplifying it down to technical explanation doesn't account when we're talking implications and theoreticals. 
I could say that eventually the human race will become faster, smarter, stronger and that's just how it goes but it doesn't acceptably answer questions on projections and caveats of the journey along the way.
I assume nothing; This is why I try to discuss everything pertinent.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:00:56
This is a valid point and it's happened before on other alt-coins, such as Namecoin. The trust is that the mining power remains high enough to process the existing blocks at *current* difficulty, in order to reach a difficulty retarget. Of all the technical problems Bitcoin has stood up to, this is actually one of the outstanding issues that other alt-coins seek to improve upon. 
Merged mining is a way for smaller networks to potentially bootstrap to larger hashing power networks (Namecoin -&gt; Bitcoin) and thus achieve more stability.
