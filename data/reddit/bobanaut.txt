actually it is wrong. a better term may be private key secret, because the BTC private key has a different format (and there are two keys for each such 'secret').
@_date: 2016-08-13 07:13:21
maybe. but wouldn't a lack of tweets do the job of telling the world he is gone? what is the point of posting a random thing on his twitter and then delete it, the way this plays out makes no sense for me... i would've expected some clear message like: get file xyz because i am dead or in trouble.
@_date: 2016-08-10 04:35:09


Would you use a key you pasted on twitter after some time passed or would you rather generate a new key if there was no meaning to it?
i for sure would not use a burned key anymore.
so there is either a) a reason for him to do it that way or b) someone else had a good reason to use the key in the way it was used, either to cause confusion (internet trolling) or to reply to snowden in some way or another.
I really can't decide which of the scenarios is the most likely (occam's razor).
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:44:55
no. it seems i am the first one who tried to generate addresses with that string. everyone else seems to have no clue
@_date: 2016-08-09 20:09:19
yep. anyone or anything. would have to correlate the dates and times of when the tweet appeared, when it was deleted, when the tx'es were issued...
i could imagine some sort of deadmen switch. he posts the tweet by pressing a button on his phone, then some time later a computer somewhere else triggers the sequence of transactions. that way he would have time to prevent false alarms
but who knows.
@_date: 2016-08-09 20:02:01
Basically i have an offline version of a brainwallet generator. except i can not only enter the passphrase but also the hash it produces.
it's something like:
"cat" =&gt; sha256 hash of that string =&gt; that is your private key hash =&gt; add some glue to make it compressed/uncompressed =&gt; generate ECDSA pub key
i don't remember the details, sorry... it's years since i played with that stuff and now i just put random gibberish in it for fun
@_date: 2016-08-13 07:08:26
a horrible cover if it is one.
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:59:00
maybe, but not just anyone is able to run a bot that can empty a known address in 30 seconds or less. i know i could not do that.
and the other address (same key hash) does not behave as if a bot is emptying it... very strange
@_date: 2016-08-09 20:04:25
up to two days after the tweet... depends on the timezones of the dates you view
@_date: 2016-08-10 04:40:35
it is a possibility. unfortunately i don't see how you can verify one or the other scenario. also that someone was snowden as he posted the hash.
For me it sounds highly unlikely that some internet troll uses a hash as the key hash to make some transactions...on both the uncompressed and the compressed keys that result from the hash (there are two keys for every hash...)
and both are used.

the idea of large txs is to split them up into lots of tiny ones. with all the benefits and problems that may arise
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:52:06
your argument for switching to BCH is not sound. especially because it's a nearly dead altcoin with near ZERO activity on the markets... all i see is BOTs adding some small changes so it looks alive...
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:00:12
it should be able to. but not as a node that does more than like 10-20 updates per second. the math is just too cpu intensive
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:04:42
i have a pending sell order at 1M Euro/BTC... so yeah...

gravity of the moon works better on bitcoins than gravity of earth right now
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:47:57
well that's the part i try to understand. but all evidence i have seen so far is telling me that this is not the case and there is actual risk to lose money by being a node with more than one channel.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:09:02
would be nice to also see the BTC per channel side...
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:53:05
if you look at a specific fork of bitcoin you can actually see a real dead coin, zoom in to like 1 minute update intervals. only thing happening: random noise by bots.
but yeah. if everyone loses interest it will not drop to 0 as many think
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:18:07
physically sending a bitcoin to the moon? that would be nice. gold plate engraved or so... shouldn't cost more than 2 coins to send it there at current prices

i am also solo mining... on my raspberry pi. so far no luck
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:11:16
as far as i've seen you can do that somehow... maybe not with the current implementations.
The idea is to share that one channel and based on that build n-to-n channels between all participants

also expendable, short living investment. BTC will stay... tulips will rot away
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:59:31
yeah... if you look at the activity of Bitcoin Cash you will see why... there is nearly nothing going on
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:15:50
i am not so sure. i am running a full BTC node but i won't want to run a full BCH node and i could not once it ups to 32MB blocks... thats 1.6TB per year on full load.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:36:46
but i think the internet can explain all your questions better... just search for them, it's not that hard
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:21:22
right now there is up to 20 nodes per onion route... of which only the receiving one can claim a fee. i don't see why that one should actually claim any fee as it's getting the requested coins anyway... so uh...
edit: it looks like there is actually a fee per (routing)node. but it's mentioned much later in the specs and the place i looked at was/is not up-to-date

i've seen that curve over and over. but is there like a valid explanation why every bubble should follow it? or is it just a religious believe that bubbles behave that way?
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:03:39
ah i see. right i remember reading about that part... yeah you can do that without participating as a real node though, you yourself don't need any channels to do that... however being selected as a bounty hunter/revoke escrow...
hmm will look if you can get yourself relevant there...
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:10:54
a full node allows me easy and fast access to the whole blockchain and if i ever need it to the mempool. sure i could use a custom client to just get the data, but it doesn't hurt me... and it's not using a noticeable amount of my system.
but a LN node is a completely different beast. while a BTC node only needs to validate blocks (sigcheck) every 10 minutes a LN node is a completely different monster.
Once the network scales big enough there will be a huge number of transactions going everywhere, 3 hops through onion routing, then generation of at least 4 ecdsa keypairs per update...
i just don't see it working with my current CPU being able to only generate 3000 ecdsa keypairs per second at full utilization ...
this costs energy, lots of energy... a miner gets the reward and fees... a LN node doesn't get anything
Also OSS doesn't ask you for more than your free time and much less for the power this time costs.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:28:10
more about you only had a small chance to get exotic looking tulips. and these were the price drivers.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:15:38
but the current specs have no fees on the nodes, only the receiver can have a fee...
so you are basically giving your channels for no fee, you have to compute with your channel partner lots of new contracts/keys and you risk having to go on the main chain if something breaks on a transaction where you are involved in, which means you have to pay normal BTC fees even though you only offer a service for someone else...
edit: it looks like there is actually a fee per (routing)node. but it's mentioned much later in the specs and the place i looked at was/is not up-to-date
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:09:41
a routing node can not take any fee for its service though. and every node is a routing node if there is more than a single channel to the network
edit: it looks like there is actually a fee per (routing)node. but it's mentioned much later in the specs and the place i looked at was/is not up-to-date
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:08:34
highly optimized c code, using gigabytes of precomputed data. one core alone can only do around 1/12 of that.
but yeah. the LN code won't be too fast.
you can go faster if you go the vanity gen route, but then you have highly correlated keys...
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:19:08
super cheap in relation to bitcoin mainnet fees. super expensive in relation to cpu usage and risk to be involved in (rollback)-activities that (may/will) cost you real BTC because someone used you as a node...
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:55:14
just let that sink in... they/he is basically saying: We don't invest anything in developing of new tech, we will just steal it once it works.
But yeah. changing the block limit is just that, changing a number in code from others
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:58:06
maybe not. you can open networks with just one on-chain tx. the on-chain tx will be bigger as normal though... but can have more than 2 participants which then do off-chain channel openings
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:56:23
it's not to fast for the previous block generator... slush was already trying to mine a full block at that time...
but yeah... 23 seconds for 1 mb blocks... guess how long the delay would be for BTH... with 32mb blocks or in their ultimate plan gigabyte blocks...
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:52:51
yes except you cannot really compare these two. because what most people ignore is that the 8-lane highway has a speed limit way below that one lane road. These MBs need more time to go through the internet
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:33:29
is this gmx account really linked to satoshi? because that is quite an interesting coincidence... gmx is mostly a german mail provider...
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:17:19
i think someone uses this chance to analyze how bad the mining delays becomes... with 8mb blocks that block has to be transported to other miners before they can do anything...
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:27:48
can you elaborate. i don't understand the "bounty hunter" concept in relation to LN
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:31:29
could be a cloud/server provider or an ISP doing ip sharing...
you can check tor exit nodes at multiple sites out there
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:29:47
it was not build to disrupt anything. it was build because it sounded like something cool/interesting to build...
the rest came afterwards to sell it
at least that's what i think and see with most of these open source projects
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:16:06
slow, overworking HDD will also make it look like core has trouble. don't put it on a hdd together with a database or other apps that cause lots of IO
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:25:47
yeah sure... right now b.-cash could handle more TXs... right now my network connection would be able to cope with it... but once it goes to 32MB blocks i would not want to run it anymore. that's a ton of traffic to get them synced, a ton of HDD space that is used and a huge delay for concurring miners to actually mine the blocks without too much handycap against the one who announced the block initially... 51% attacks will be a lot easier with these conditions.
but that doesn't belong in this thread...
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:06:16
the fee is only as high as you are willing to pay. you can always wait for less stressful days
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:21:38
so if the hardware fails you can ask for them to recover ~~their~~your funds... at least that's the only reason i see for such preprinted codes...
even then it's stupid and dangerous. especially because a) it indicates that they don't trust their hardware and b) they have a hackable database with all passphrases out there, somewhere... maybe on a cloud service that isn't properly protected
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:44:55
i don't think LN is able to do that right now. I haven't looked into all the papers too deep, but BOLT4 (  ) only mentions receivers fees... no intermediate node can claim any fee if you follow the document 100%.
The protocol would need to be extended so that a node not only shares it's public key but also the fee a client should use. Then a client could computes the fee per node and if your node doesn't agree with the given fee you reject to forwards it...
but as of now i don't see it being in the specs
edit: it looks like there is actually a fee per (routing)node. but it's mentioned much later in the specs and the place i looked at was/is not up-to-date
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:02:44
did not read your link... just want to know... whom are you selling it to if no one can buy?
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:27:33
i see. this is actually great news... someone should update BOLT4 reflecting that though....
so i can actually set a very high fee if i don't want to route at all as a side effect.... yep nice
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:16:45
yes and no. It depends on the amount of transactions waiting to be added to the chain... currently it's just people trying to get fast confirmations and outbidding others. they are all willing to pay these ridiculous fees... but it would make no difference to the system if the fees are much higher or much lower.
As far as i've seen at least one exchange has crappy software and is driving the pending transaction count up... in their own interest they will update...
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:21:05
the problem is when your limit is not 10K and you do it. if you are limited you are actually better of
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:59:05
So uh... why would i want to run a Lightning Network Node? There is no incentive for me to do so. Actually i would prefer my Client/Wallet to not work as a node that shifts my coins between my channels in the background...
just because someone else transfers funds over me... how would i prevent that? keep only one channel to the network and hope that the other side is always on?
Edit: I am running a full btc node but it's not consuming much cpu as it's only doing simple math... a LN network node is generating a lot of keys and stuff... With enough usage this will cut really heavy into CPU/power costs... Generating these little suckers (ECDSA key pairs) is pretty time consuming
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:33:45
your node won't accept fake blocks. no matter from whom you get them it will evaluate the rules it's written against and accept or reject these fully.
however i have never looked into the actual networking part so i just assume that a client comes with a bootstrap lists of nodes and then builds from there.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:46:48
"dir wallet.dat /S" for every drive in the root
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:25:01
so can we assume that the main spammer exchange lost all/most of his clients? or did they actually implement proper batching and segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:48:40
that's only comparing tx... but if you compare the real costs of BTC, that is mining, then LN is a lot cheaper because you don't have to mine a whole block, just generate a new set of contracts...
a wild guess of me is that it costs you like 100ms of computing time at most... if your computer uses like mine 300Watts it results in 30 joules (0.0000083.. kwh) or at most some 0.000249$ on your power bill.
but it may be up to 20 times that as you can go through 20 nodes on your way... still under a cent though
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:51:28
funny... you know who will cause the most outgoing txs from coinbase? people leaving... /s
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:27:06
can you show me where in the BOLTs/specs that part is mentioned? because last time i checked it wasn't there (BOLT4, yesterday)
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:48:00
well kind of. do you have your private key? if so you can create a transaction as a double spend with higher fees... if not... no chance
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:31:30
can you show where they did say it? all i have seen is that they will NOT trade BCH but will allow withdrawals on the 1st
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:40:04
how about someone else does the investigation, just saying... likely they won't find anything
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:21:00
and if you know some days before that there will be liquidity issues (aka insider knowledge)... won't you prepare? i think that's what happened and many people have been had
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:06:26
you just want cheap christmas coins
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:15:40
sorry i haven't looked into it, can't tell... i am more interested in the main chain
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:56:06
when the world stops being all about money...
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:04:00
either DDOS or too many people trying to buy
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:49:29
the market automates that. you can instant buy/sell (not seen in the graphic)
ask for a specific price to sell at (red)
or ask to buy at a specific price (green)
think of this way. you have like 10 BTC, if you instant sell it you will eat on the green graph and the price will drop until your order has been fullfilled... in the above video it would potentially drop to 13.5k making you something between 13.5k * 10BTC and 14k * 10 BTC.
if you set it to sell at 14k you will get 14k * 10 BTC but only if enough people eat your wall.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:50:58
i would prefer calling it BitcoinCrash, thanks to that guy we successfully evaded the bubble by forking it away...
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:11:45
sorry but this is not the correct way. NEVER touch your wallet.dat file.
the correct way is to ... and this assumes you are already running a full node...
delete the mempool file and start the bitcoind client with  -walletbroadcast=0
then you can abandon the tx in your client...
this will take at least 2 weeks to clear
you can try a double spend in that time if you know how... but not through your full-node client
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:43:53
it takes a long time initially. but you also have to download like 150GB or so. i am also using a full tx index on mine so it's more like 200GB
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:17:57
interesting transaction... shouldn't take 24 hours even in current conditions... maybe miners added custom code to fuck with people doing 1 million dollar tx...
edit: i think i see the problem. the transaction you linked is fine. the other txes are not though... so there is not enough fees for all of them together
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:03:31
but but... i can't sell for the highest of highest now... /s
until it drops in a month to levels way above this...
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:34:30

i am sort of interested on the cpu/traffic of LN myself...
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:35:00
sorry but with only HODLers there would be no price. you need people to actually buy/sell for anything to happen
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:39:42
How about calling it something else? a balloon?
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:09:02
well. there are ways to charge back if you have no confirmations... but they are hard ways for people who don't know how
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:40:46
one tx means you have been included in a block... you may have been unlucky and your tx ended up in an orphaned block...
else the other confirmations are just the number of following blocks
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:53:12
12 phrases? you mean 12 word passphrase to a wallet? i don't remember blockchain supporting that... so no idea, sorry...
but if you used an offline wallet and imported the key into blockchain and your fees are low enough, chances are very high to get the stuff back
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:50:39
edit: grain... like you know what sand is made of?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:02:31
i am getting at least "-800 usd" per year running this full node, yes... that's negative...
there are many like me, but i think BTC doesn't need full nodes...
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:43:03
pretty much. the chances of someone getting your coins is like picking the correct sand corn on a planet inside a galaxy...
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:43:00
you should tell them, yeah so what. wait a year until you either lose all of it or have at least doubled it
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:43:11
kind of. you will have to make a transaction that is using more fees, then broadcast through others and keep your client offline. that's the short story. if your fees are too high you will most likely just send them to an unspendable/wrong output
edit: forget that client part... blockchain will not go offline for you
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:59:15
if real and they really give away all satoshis coins expect instant price drop by 50%, another 50% because people will sell to get the real BTC...

but i have only virtual money in this game, so no idea
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:30:23
well... if you don't know... search for wallet.dat on your pc... if you have such a file. never give it away and so ...research. 50btc (a block mining reward back in the old days) may be worth half a million...

the one that they do inhouse and that will find nothing suspicious
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:22:28
see my edit... someone used 0 fees for one of the txes used in that tx... means not enough fees... a miner may ignore this whole chain of transactions... this is sort of a downside of BTC
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:05:03
which is strange, because arbitrage is usually considered a positive/stabilizing thing
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:18:34
people in for the profit mostly. doubling your assets in just 2-3 days?, can't do that with BTC at the current moment. the other one though... 
i think in the real world the last few days would be susceptible to investigation of insider-knowledge (as someone clearly did know that there would be a big exchange allowing BCH while that exchange claimed it won't)... a new market obviously pushes the price

I have an offline dictionary of around 80 billion key-addresses that constantly checks against the blockchains incoming blocks, takes around 1.3TB HDD space (lookup is at around 10-100 addresses per second). I also have RNGs that are not saved but instantly checked against a DB of known addys... none of them yielded anything so far, obviously.
Edit: i think i have enough money to let it run for a while longer, no need to turn the experiment off. Doesn't take much of my CPU anyway... using like 20-30% of a hexacore that is on 24/7 anyway...

it automatically cross references on the fly. Every new block outputs are checked at a rate of around 100 outputs per second.

Hits so far: 0, this will be true for the next few hundred years...

you could do what some people do. get yourself a working copy of truecrypt (version 7.1a) and then start by encrypting your system partition (pay special attention to dual boot). after that encrypt all other drives and add them to system favorite volumes. that way you enter one password pre OS boot and everything is encrypted.
encrypting a SAN/NAS that way is a bit harder and not always possible.

If CoinWallet gives me the private keys to said addresses i will gladly collect the dust for them. And i can push much more than 1tx per second, just saying...
for all miners: if i am correct then coinwallet will not collect a cent of the dust they just spread around (1.5 million UTXOs).
Instead they will release the private keys and expect the dust collectors to cause spam. and here the miners have a clear advantage. They can simply ignore all these addresses from their mempools and build txes for their own good. without any fees and limits...
The last spam was not collected by CoinWallet either. Well known dust collectors and a few new collectors got it by paying loads of fees.
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:14:59
Doesn't matter. No one will ever hit any of these addresses. and i am not a dust collector so i don't care about the money involved...
@_date: 2015-08-14 10:13:44
as far as i remember everyone who knows the private key to an address is by definition the owner of anything that is on said address. i would not call it stealing.

I am currently holding 80000000000 (~2^36.219) addresses. Only takes 1.35TB on my HDD... that is 5% of what space i could spare for experiments. Took me around 1 month to learn about BTC, play around with optimized key/address generating and storing them in a usable and compressed index.
Be unlucky and send me &gt;1BTC onto one of MY addresses and i will gladly collect them.
it would still need a shitload of people and time to get a collision if everyone did that...

@_date: 2015-08-14 10:08:24
the amount does not matter. even dust is collected if the key is known. it just means that no one has generated a pair for that sentence yet. Try some text from wikipedia and you have a pretty good chance to throw your BTCs away.
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:07:29
that rate is not that high if you need to store said addresses. vanitigen works on the assumption that it can also check said address on the gpu.
but if you have a program/algorithm that can reach more than 10k key/address pairs and also outputs these through some sort of interface. gimme
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:52:16
i Highly doubt that the spam attack had any intention to alter transaction fees or the likes.
What i have observed is that the first wave used easy to generate addresses from brainwallet passphrases.
This caused dust collectors to trigger a massive wave of collects. That is the so called "Spam" and this phase ended on the 19th when all dust was consumed (around 6BTC total).
The current attack uses addresses that no dust collector seems to know. That means there are more and more UTXOs accumulating (currently around 2.6Million). It only costs around 1BTC to generate 100000 of these UTXOs. The fee does not change much in that number. Get yourself 26BTC and you can double the UTXOs of right now.
No change in blocksize will help this attack. The increase of the blocksize will just make this attack easier because you can spread faster.
I have no clue what the point of this would be and why anyone has so many BTC free to waste. But these UTXOs will likely stay there forever...
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:34:09
This address belongs to a guy from romania (i think, may be anywhere). It's meant to attack easy to generate brainwallet addresses.
Don't be fooled. This guy is NOT ping ponging his own money, he is stealing from others.
Since like 2 or 3 days someone is actively pushing small amounts of money onto one of the generated addresses. I see like 0.08831BTC per such key and i know 11 such keys, each equally loaded).
Maybe it is an attempt to pinpoint the location of that guy and catch him or maybe someone is very stupid.
Disclaimer: I am NOT that guy and i am NOT stealing your BTC. Just observing with a small set of 80 billion keys.
Anyway: Don't use easy to generate Keys, especially not from brainwallet and simple words or passphrases... There are at least 3 active 'stealers' out there
@_date: 2015-07-29 22:35:06


no it would cost him exactly the same. it would just be twice as fast. Or the attacker could just attack twice as effective if he doubled his effort. 
The main question is: Will the attacker release the private keys for the dust addresses to trigger a massive wave of people trying to collect them? And how big will that wave be compared to the last one...
@_date: 2015-08-08 16:48:07
i don't get it. i am doing something similar and the check is against 5 million distinct addresses. Don't need all UTXOs, which are around 32 million right now. The slowest part is calculating the key-address pairs. The lookup into that dictionary is not even worth optimizing, it has zero impact
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:46:05
except there are addresses that are unspendable and forever lost:
- one case is the private key: (0)_binary. It is by definition unspendable
- other cases are addresses that can't be generated from a private key. basically invalid ripemd-160 hashes. you can put pretty much anything there and add the network id byte and a checksum to make them look valid
- another case is unspendable scripts.
@_date: 2015-07-07 11:29:44
This is one of the addresses:
now look...
The private key for that address is: "5KQrSps8HkctwL2aQ443duHSmxemt356nAWdULAv46GjVpCwNcF"
Don't enter it in your wallet. It won't give you shit and you risk being frauded if you do so!
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:25:57
The attack (generating UTXOs) has a fixed cost and the speed is determined by how many spreading transactions you can execute in a given time. The fee used there is not relevant.
The bigger the blocksize the more likely it is that a transactions can be done in a fixed time frame. The blocksize has NO effect on the cost.
The "Spam Attack" or rather "Dust collectors going nuts" is the part that would have benefitted from a bigger blocksize because it would be more likely for all the spam to clean up faster. Except there are miners that don't care and just never fill up the possible blocksize...
As far as i see there is not much of the dust collecting going on, if any at all. The so called spam is missing!
see the transaction outputs in this block for example (block 367530):
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:32:47
every transaction involved in this attack has 50 outputs. Example:
It is always the same transaction fee. The block size has zero effect on this. so tell me. where is this not a fixed cost attack?
there is no clean up going on.
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:12:52
i see now what causes the misunderstanding.
you assume that the attack is the 'spam' that may be caused by the dust collectors. there is none of that as i mentioned, yet.
i on the other hand assume that the attack is meant to blow up the UTXOs. and there the blocksize only affects the speed of the attack.
i may be wrong. and my question was referring to that. if it ends up with a dust collection spam wave like last time then everything should settle pretty quick with or without a bigger blocksize
@_date: 2015-09-02 06:19:09
If this is already the spam attack they meant then i am disappointed.
I was expecting the other way, millions of little inputs towards bigger inputs. This is just less than a day worth of backlog.
@_date: 2015-09-01 11:56:11
so far nothing happens. There may have been an attempt to start the attack around the 28th of August as someone spread a ton of random small transactions (0.001 to 0.005 BTC) towards random addresses and coming from addresses controlled by 'them'.
But nothing after that happened. So my guess is that they made a mistake and the attack failed.
@_date: 2015-09-16 11:14:59
from the looks of what happened in the "stress test" miners take the transactions that have higher fee in case of conflicts. so the OP_RETURN ones (100% fee) seem to be cleaning up nicely. only around 3BTC to go and this whole ordeal is over. maybe 1 or 2 more days, who knows if there will be some chaos on the end...
@_date: 2015-09-10 12:10:49
if my computations are correct it's around 1.6BTC on these addresses
@_date: 2015-09-10 13:06:13
I think they released like 10 BTC so far and the mempool is already at 80MB if you don't filter TXes...
Thats only 5% of 200 BTC, oh well. Lets see when the first nodes start to crash because of out of memory exceptions
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:28:50
It looks that way. especially if you look at the spike downs on the mempool. Basically a miner creates a transaction of any sort with 500 inputs one output and any fee they like, then they just fill up the block.
They don't need to worry about unconfirmed transactions and double spending of these, all they need to ensure is that they don't use already confirmed UTXOs. Interesting
@_date: 2015-09-13 21:46:11
From what i see there are still around 11 BTC pending (1.1 million UTXOs) but miners are ignoring 99% of the spam.
Some people at bitcointalk seem to have started sending the stuff to OP_RETURN and 100% fee, this has caused some massive cleanups in the last hours...
There is also around 130 more Addresses/Keys that were not released during the spam attack. they sum up to 1 million UTXOs and 56 BTC. i would say around 75% are from the 'stress tester'.
Not sure if my observation tool is still in sync, it can't handle rollbacks of more than 6 blocks...
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:28:46
So their plan is and was to ruin the two scalability workshops?
@_date: 2015-09-20 10:05:40
I would say congratulations to not losing the keys in over 6 years. I would've lost them like at least 10 times in that time period.
@_date: 2015-09-01 13:20:40


they did? i must've missed that post.
as far as i see they used brainwallet passphrases like "cat", "password1", "password2" and so on.
@_date: 2015-09-03 10:23:16
People seem to not have mentioned it but in many clients it is possible to export the private key(s) and then reimport them on a trusted Webwallet (does not need a full node running on your pc) etc.
But as long as you can see the coins on said address and you have the private key your coins are safe... use any block exporer of your likes to check the address.
@_date: 2015-09-16 09:36:26
just check the first 2000 blocks or so, any block that has an unspent output is most likely his... 
But at this point it is all speculations. This is an interesting read and may contain some truth about satoshis blocks/BTC
@_date: 2015-09-10 12:47:08
Around 2.6 BTC this time.
It looks like the claiming is ridiculously fast too, at least on the unconfirmed side
@_date: 2015-09-10 20:54:46
Just ran a quick check, basically: every UTXO &lt;= 0.00001 that is not part of the coinwallet.eu keys that were released.
and guess what:
around 109.5 BTC
around 12.6 Million UTXOs
The 'attackers' have only released like 15-20 BTC worth of keys/addresses (1.5 to 2 Million UTXOs) and they claimed to have 200 BTC prepared for the 'attack'. I don't see how these numbers add up...
@_date: 2015-09-09 15:48:20
Proof of Burn. The OP_Return contains the user id of the person who burned the BTC for whatever altcoin he/she got instead.
@_date: 2015-09-10 07:34:00
As far as i can tell the keys are valid. Just that the address loaded is compressed
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:35:32
I think it only has proven the point of being pointless to release a ton of private keys. The mempool indicates that the pools/miners simply took a big chunk and will take a bigger chunk yet... They have the easiest job at constructing a transaction. Don't need to worry about the mempool or any existing unconfirmed transactions. They simply make transactions with unconfirmed inputs and fill up their block as they like... The rest will clean up itself and work as designed
@_date: 2015-09-01 11:59:44
If the attack works like the old one the attacker is not causing the spam. he is just feeding dust collectors. These cause the spam.
Now imagine someone releases private keys to addresses fully loaded with dust to everyone. And everyone who has the know how tries to collect these...
Look at this transaction and it's outputs. The preparation was already done some time ago. Only the trigger is missing:
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:20:18
And i don't get that part. they already did that stage last month. there are now around 15 million UTXOs smaller or equal to 0.00001BTC. Totalling in a sum of 128BTC.
At least 2.6 million of these UTXOs were generated last month by the 'attacker'. They had plenty of time to prepare for stage 2
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:03:23
Yes. Obviously. It all depends on CoinWallets stress test and if someone else wants to waste his/her coins to create dust UTXOs.
But then. 100MB is nothing and you don't need to keep the UTXOs in memory...
@_date: 2015-09-10 11:23:50
It looks a bit like they do exactly that. At least one of the claiming Users/Bots is doing huge transactions with huge fees but only to fill up the backlog to around 55-60MB.
These transactions are usually around 80KB in size and have 500 inputs, one output... i just remember seeing something similar some time ago when 'they' prepared for the 'stress test'

the next start it just says everything is fine and exits without warning or log entry before showing the main UI.
that sort of bugs, can't report these because there is basically nothing to report except: exits on startup
edit: oh and on the computer specs. lets say i can reindex 87GB of data in less than a day without any problem. even reading more than 8.4TB or reading half that and writing half that in one day is no problem, yet... bitcoin core fails to do that.
Infact it's running at &lt;1% cpu/resources available for no reason
edit2: it never did that on older reindexes, it never took more than a day and all HDD(s) are fine
