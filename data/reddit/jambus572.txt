To pin down a point you identified; it wasn't the increase in house prices that was unsustainable, that burst the 2008 bubble, it was that the demand for houses that precipitated said price rise was supported by leverage. The capital supporting the price rise here is different, given that the majority of retail investors are acquiring using their own equity. 
A bitcoin doesn't have to be acquired in a discrete unit, like a house, and the absolute value of one bitcoin is, for now, considerably less than a house. Not comparable. 
Until people are releasing equity and leveraging their house to buy bitcoin, on a widespread basis and not solely on there's insufficient parallels you can draw to say with any certainty that it will crash. 
I'm more inclined to believe a correction of sorts is slowly unravelling; the lack of upward momentum the last few days will be sufficient to see the latest wave of retail investors liquidate. It's not been the wild moon ride they hoped for, the punch has been removed from the party and they showed too late. It's just a test of whether this is sufficient to revise the price downward by an order of magnitude, or it just places sufficient downward price pressure to halt any further advance for the time being.

I already answered; they'll sell when they realise the "hype" is over. My point, however, is that the majority of bitcoin is held by idealist investors, and concentrated in the hands of very few. That isn't the kind of incredibly short-term investors who are now liquidating. You can't say with certainty if the sale of retail, speculative investments that account for little volume will be sufficient to cause a mass unwind.
