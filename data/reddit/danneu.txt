Watching the guy talk is enough to unmask him as an impersonator.
Like when he tried introducing himself at this panel that he apparently invited himself to:

Agreed. 
It's not unlike the last time I went to the local Ruby programmer meetup that had an open mic for people to give mini talks. The idea is that you could share something interesting, like maybe how you tackled a certain problem over the last few months.
Some of the people giving talks were clearly there just to fluff their resume with "I gave a talk" (big deal as a developer since it confers social proof) despite the actual content of the talk being one of incompetent, beginner level, or meaningless.
Similarly, I can identify this common thread in Bitcoin panels where some of the panel speakers have promoted themselves to "bitcoin expert", particularly when they have a non-technical background yet they talk about technical aspects of the protocol.
It's not so much "gee, this guy doesn't know as much as he says he does". It's more like, as you said, "gee, why the fuck is he on the panel then?"
Weird social behavior is fine. Here's Richard Stallman eating something off his foot in the middle of a Q&amp;A:  But the difference between Stallman and self-elected panel'eers is the gulf between self-promotion and what one actually knows / has accomplished.

I can't help but let these panels make me feel a lil less optimistic about bitcoin. They just kinda chip away, each in their unique way.
I mean, that hat guy wears the same hat every time I've seen him, and it's not obvious what he's done or why he's there. 
Just seems like a bunch of "me too" people, though Nick Szabo at least seems like he has a raging clue.

That tutorial is definitely not bare-bones.
Here's a simpler one:
1. SSH into your Ubuntu box.
2. Download and install `bitcoind`.
        $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get install bitcoind
3. Start it and it will begin catching up with the network.
        $ bitcoind -daemon

Many casinos have static, public addresses that Coinbase absorbs into its database that it checks withdrawals against. 
Coinbase has to at least look like it's trying if it wants to continue spanning the fiat&lt;-&gt;BTC gulf. Not sure why they're getting so much hate. Use Coinbase to buy/sell BTC and then move it to your own wallet.

That's not how opportunism works.
If a pool is squandering blocks, then the only rational choice you have is to join it.
This idea of bitcoin miners waving a banner of decentralized ideals and Stallman principles is endearing, but miners are opportunistic actors. That's why they invested serious capital into mining hardware.

"Awesome' is a strong word.
For fun, I started implementing Bitcoin ([github.com/danneu/chaingun]( last year in Clojure, another JVM language. 
For one, I found [Bouncy Castle]( (crypto library) unnavigable. Here's the API:  
Starting there, can you figure out how to do basic things like define some curve parameters? Or generate your curve keypair? Or generate any hash from a string input? It took me all day to figure out which 10 classes had to collaborate just to define my curve parameters: 
I straight-up gave up on ASN/DER encoding and ported BitcoinJ's relevant code into my ECDSA `sign` and `verify` functions. 
Anyways, I know the topic here is merely "working with Bitcoin" rather than "reimplementing Bitcoin". And I know some of these things are only marginally easier in other languages, like replicating Bitcoin's use of OpenSSL functions (like ASN). But I just wanted to pass along the hilarious dose of reality that I stumbled upon.
It's all in good sport. :)
I recommend people to check out the Python and even the Node.js Bitcoin-related libraries. They are much easier to work with if you want to glue together some basic components. 
For example, I'd consider vbuterin's pybitcointools pretty easy to consume and understand if you want to see some Bitcoin concepts (like generating addresses/pubkeys from privkeys) implemented in actual code. (Link: 
In just 80 lines of code, here's an encode/decode round-trip between all the privkey/pubkey formats that Bitcoin uses:  Super simple.

It's nothing like that. 
The point is that it's trivial for Coinbase to see that you sent money from your Coinbase wallet to a gambling service. Since it's trivial, they have to at least look like they're making an effort to stop it since they are complying with regulation, or else they can be considered complicit.
The real issue is people using Coinbase as their wallet instead of as a buy/sell service.

Difficulty is irrelevant and is related to the total hashing power of the network. It only exists to manage the rate at which the network can find blocks.
But here we are talking about owning a percent of it whether it's 1 hash per second or 1 hash per Planck unit.
@_date: 2014-12-25 06:19:04
Whenever you move bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet to another address, Coinbase probably checks that address against their database of known addresses of casinos and other things that violate their ToS.
They can't care what happens to the money after that one hop because they can't assume it's you. Moral of the story is to transfer your money away from Coinbase before you spend it.

Regardless, there are good points on both sides, and it's more of a philosophical "what is bitcoin" debate than a technical one that's never had to be answered until now. Else it would be easy.
Though it's disconcerting that most of the core devs are now involved with one private company, and it muddies the water.

It's neither hard nor expensive.
You store a rainbow table in a database and see if you have collisions in the mempool.
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:50:19
but that doesn't have much to do with adoption because day to day btc use isn't constrained by volume. there are other reasons like the fact that bitcoin is bleeding edge and there isn't much upside for most business aside from a "we now accept bitcoin" marketing boost.

What about listening and pouncing on transactions as they're broadcast? I would think that being well-situated in the network dwarfs the milliseconds of output lookup spent in the database.
Your talk seems focused on crawling the space rather than flipping the mempool. Is there video?

One of the main issues is that your wallet software links up a bunch of addresses to create a transaction.
It's like if you have $2 in one pocket and $3 in another pocket, to buy something that costs $5 you have to reach into  both pockets.

The reference implementation *is* the protocol. In a decentralized system, small variations in implementation will remove you from the network.


No. Since every miner is mining on bitcoin-core rules because they have to, an exploit in the source code would be exploitable across the network. It would be catastrophic if, for example, you found a weakness that let you spend arbitrary outputs.
@_date: 2015-03-28 04:56:26

They never send "inv" payloads to other nodes which tell nodes what data your node has available to share (


Nodes flag other nodes for doing atypical things and will ultimately ban other nodes if they aren't playing well.


An "addr" payload is sent between nodes to broadcast known ip addresses of other nodes to connect to ( These nodes broadcast bad information.

You aren't actually spending the coins in a transaction.
You're only creating an output that specifies a coin value and an output-script (an expression that someone else must be able to satisfy). 
If you or someone wants to spend that output, in a new transaction they have to create an input so that `&lt;input-script&gt;&lt;previous-output-script&gt;` evaluates to true (a non-zero result).
In this case, the previous-output-script is "OP_DUP". The input-script is "1".
Put them together and then this must evaluate to true:
    1 OP_DUP
OP_DUP simply duplicates the last value, so the above becomes `1 1`. Since it ends in 1 and a non-zero value is true, the person that created this input can now create an output that does something else with the coins.
Anybody could've spent it because anybody could've created an input that refers to that OP_DUP output and provided any script that returns a non-zero value.

Someone double spends and your node receives the one that doesn't make it into the blockchain.

Bitcoin scripting is simple to understand with examples.
- Previous output: `39 OP_ADD 42 OP_EQUAL`
This output will let anyone spend it if they can solve the challenging puzzle of x + 39 = 42.
Let's answer it so we can spend its coins. We create a new transaction with an input and a new output (I don't show the new output).
- Our input: `3`
Then we broadcast it. Nodes in the network can evaluate `&lt;input-script&gt;&lt;prev-output-script&gt;` to see if our transaction (and thus the outputs we create) are valid.
To verify it, nodes evaluate our example like this::
    3 39 OP_ADD 42 OP_EQUAL
You just walk from left to right. `OP_ADD` combines the previous two values into a sum:
    42 42 OP_EQUAL
`OP_EQUAL` returns 1 (true) if the previous two values are the same, else it returns 0.
    1
Since the evaluation of our `&lt;input-script&gt;&lt;output-script&gt;` example turns out to be nonzero (true), then the transaction is considered valid. If we had instead said `9`, then it would've evaluated to `48 42 OP_EQUAL` and then `0` (false) and nodes would reject our transaction.
