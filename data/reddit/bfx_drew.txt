We moved from there two years ago. However the accountants office staff there know of us and help visitors get in touch with us when they stop by about once a month. 
But come to Taipei if you want to visit us - Meetings can be arranged by appointment. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 00:11:29
Yes, I believe that is correct. We still work with the accountants office at that old location but they are not Bitfinex employees.

Taking on investors always dilutes the ownership of the current shareholders, doesn't it? 
Anyways, yes, the ownership of the prior shareholders is now much less (about 35% I believe) and that ownership has been transferred to new shareholders
EDIT: closer to 40%
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:39:18
Seems so. Bitfinex defending an attack right now 
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:20:14
Are you just generally frustrated or do you have some recommendation of how it could have handled better? If the latter, I'm genuinely curious to hear your ideas.
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:58:56
CloudFlare has informed us that no Bitfinex data was present in the bugged caches.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:52:50
Confirmed: this post's title is intentionally misleading and sensational. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:26:58
**CloudFlare has informed Bitfinex that no Bitfinex data was present in the bugged caches**.
Bitfinex has been using CloudFlare since early January 2017. CloudFlare has informed Bitfinex that no Bitfinex data was present in the bugged caches
Since the chance of a login request being leaked is extremely tiny ( 0.00003%) and since CloudFlare has fixed the bug and there is no sign of Bitfinex data in the caches, it is almost impossible for someone to be compromised now due to this CloudFlare bug. (Even more impossible if the user has 2FA enabled, which we pester all users about enabling each time they log in if they have over 500 USD in equity).
However, some users are taking this event as a good opportunity to change their passwords or enable 2FA if they do not have it already enabled.
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:16:47


That would be a worse outcome for everyone involved, including yourself.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:49:43
More likely that a small subset of the coins have been sold on the dark web and the new owners don't know they have stolen coins.
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:50:18


It sounds like you have some good ideas here. What are a few of your recommendations? 


If you're a shareholder than yes this information is available and please contact support to get going with that. 
If you're not a shareholder, just ball park or assume some values and numbers when creating your recommended solutions. 
I realize you don't have all the numbers, but maybe just outline a couple scenarios or make assumptions and then share your recommendations. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:04:08
So because you expected the worst, you want the worst? A bit masochistic for my taste, but I guess Bitfinex can't please everyone...
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:45:55
Bitfinex is currently under DDoS attack. Service might be degraded or intermittent for some users. We are taking steps now to recover and restore full service. 
This seems like the latest in several exchanges that were targeted today, including BTCe and Coinbase who were attacked and down earlier in the day I believe.
EDIT: System is returning to normal.
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:48:24
You can go to the landing page and click "View Demo" or just navigate directly to  and you can use the chart. (cc @_date: 2017-02-27 16:59:08
I think I understand. What I was hoping to get clarity on is if you have any specific ideas about a better way to handle the event after the fact. That it happened is absolutely awful. What Bitfinex is trying to do to recover and do the best it can for those who lost is something we have control over and can continue to improve I hope.
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:45:01
Scam exchange? I'm curious to hear why you say that.
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:36:04


I'm curious. What is this claim based on?
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:12:24
The bitcoins that BitGo held for Bitfinex were never insured and no one was ever lead to believe they were insured.


This is an interesting claim, and feel free to enlighten everyone on your recommended setup, but it has no relevance to the current topic: your claim that Bitfinex lied about security practices. 
Getting back onto topic: please tell me exactly in what ways you believe Bitfinex lied about their security practices. This is a serious accusation and it deserves to be addressed.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:36:20
The implementation was widely known and discussed - the user wallets were 2 of 3 multi-signature, and the holders of the keys were Bitfinex, the user, and BitGo. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:47:28
On Bitfinex there are currently 25,000 BTC lent out and another 25,000 BTC available for lending. What amount would you consider "more people"? 
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:50:29


So a liquidation of company assets to try to make users whole? That would have not even come close to covering the losses and would have stopped any potential for future restitution. That is why as much money as possible was given to uses while holding back a contingency liability fund to pay for continued operations, with a plan to return funds to users incrementally from future revenues. 
In a liquidation context, the process would be long and painful and ultimately result in users getting less back.


Bitmex has gotten plenty of criticism for having their index be 50% Bitstamp and 50% okc. Rediculous. But no need to get into that... 


Again, because they wanted to take the chance to slight us after the incident - a power move. The only reason they haven't added Bitfinex back to their index is stubborness. They're trying to save face.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:41:56
The implementation and the demise of the setup are big topics, but what I am interested in is your claim that Bitfinex lied about their security. This is a serious claim and I'm curious what evidence or reason you have to support it.
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:57:10


Would you have recommended liquidating company assets to try to make users whole? That would have not even come close to covering the losses and would have stopped any potential for future restitution.

@_date: 2017-03-12 21:42:19
I believe the way I always tried to phrased it was that Bitfinex's solution with BitGo "satisfied" the CFTC's delivery requirement. While the CFTC never gave explicit approval, they did decide to drop their formal concerns and inquiry. Legal counsel was clear that we couldn't imply that the CFTC formally "approved."
With regards to blaming uncle sam: I don't think it's fair to put the blame on regulatory pressure for the whole BitGo fiasco, but it adds an interesting talking point nonetheless. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:44:57


That is exactly how BitGo works. BitGo signs through the use of an API. 


The reason we are still discussing this is that you first made a very grave accusation. Then, when asked to support it, you keep switching to a critique of the implementation. 
If you have anything at all to back up your claim that Bitfinex lied about their security implementation, I'm all ears.
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:00:38
I'm not sure that is true. May I ask where you got that information?
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:19:35


The hack was awful, there is no denying that. As far as handling of the loss and the methods chosen to recover and make users whole, I'd put forward that the approach taken is the best possible for the hack victims. If you have recommendations for how it could have been handled after the hack I am curious to hear your thoughts.
The "trading on their own exchange" is a tiresome meme at this point. We test all kinds of functionality on the platform - this has been misrepresented to imply "active trading" by people who want to whip up some sweet sweet indignation. 


Theories and assumptions. Talk to big traders and see if any of them have a suspicion of this. The reason Bitfinex has the volume it does is because large traders know they are being treated fairly.


Bitfinex warns you at 22.5% and liquidates at 15%.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:50:44
I understand that you are upset that the hack happened. It is truly awful and the Bitfinex team is working hard to make things right as much as possible. 
The reason I am engaging you on this particular point - your claim that Bitfinex lied about security policy - is because I think you are sincere but mistaken, and I'd like to help clarify the points you might be mistaken about. It is a very serious accusation and it is important to have the truth here. You wouldn't want to continue with the slander.


Yes, this was stated. And multi-key (I think you mean multisignature) was used. So no lying here.


This was not stated and was not true. So no lying here, either.
If you are remembering something about insured funds, it could be from the Synapse integration that Bitfinex used for US customers for a while.
What else can I help clarify?
@_date: 2016-06-02 20:48:50
Hey guys, sorry I'm late. We were just discussing this over at 
Yes, we've reached a settlement with the CFTC and believe we meet all of our obligations under the Commodity Exchange Act. This is very good news for us and our customers.
We see this announcement as a good thing because it means we've had an in-depth dialog and have reached a settlement with the CFTC. Their inquiry is over. We’re pleased with the results, and it’s business as usual, including for U.S. customers, which is the CFTC’s area of concern.
We believe it's a good use of our energy to dialogue with regulating bodies like the CFTC in order to be confident in our business practices. We won't undermine the quality of any of our services.
From their presser:


more details 
@_date: 2016-06-02 23:11:21
It's good because bitcoin is new and the regulatory environment is still coming into form. Before any sort of inquiry by the CFTC, customers might wonder "Will Bitfinex suddenly get shut down, or will they suddenly freeze US customer's accounts?" 
This announcement comes at the close of a CFTC inquiry that resulted in a small fine and Bitfinex making a few small business and operational changes in order to satisfy our obligations to things such as the Commodity Exchange Act. 
Now, here we are, the inquiry has been over for months, and it is business as usual - most notably for our U.S. customers.
@_date: 2016-06-02 23:44:23
No, I can't, sorry.
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:56:03
Not stalling - the investigation is moving forward at full steam. There are complex legal issues regarding what can be released, but we are carefully preparing a progress report. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:02:00
Is your argument, "If Bitfinex employees act badly, that would be bad"? 
Anyways I am interested in your claims that Bitfinex has somehow gained massive profits from the hack. The company is taking profits and giving it to users to redeem BFX tokens. Are you saying that is somehow more profitable than just keeping the original profits?
I understand that *you make sense to yourself*, but a little reflection might be time well spent. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 20:54:16
Not sure about about "fractional leverage" but I think you mean their concern about the underlying asset being deliverable? We have met the CFTCs concerns and their inquiry is over and it is business as usual - including for US customers.
@_date: 2017-01-27 17:29:03


Care to explain your reasoning here? 
@_date: 2017-01-27 19:27:56
I think what you might be fundamentally upset about is the information asymmetry. Is that right? Bitfinex knows more than you about the hack and the ongoing legal shenanigans that prevent publically disclosing all the details, and that upsets you? Do you understand what not all the information about the hack can be made public at this time? 
@_date: 2017-01-27 17:55:51
Creating and crediting the BFX tokens was to provide more options for users. Can you think of an alternate solution that would have been better? I'm genuinely curious because I know Bitfinex has received criticism but I'm not sure if I've heard better solutions - even with the post hoc benefit of hindsight. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:57:20
There is a 5% bounty that we are willing to provide for returned coins. No questions asked. We are flexible about the payment terms (if they want it in a specific coin, like Monero, etc).
@_date: 2017-01-27 19:20:08
You make assumptions that have no credibility, and then pretend to put forth valid conclusions. Just because you can imagine scenarios doesn't mean that is the real world.
For your last example: because Bitfinex employees could know about returned funds before the public, they could buy RRT tokens before anyone else and benefit unfairly from insider knowledge. This is an example of something, in the future, that could happen. Do you see how this insufficient to make claims about wrongdoing? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:23:50
Over the past two hours Bitfinex experienced two platform issues:
1. Login issues lasting about 40 minutes
2. Display issues for balances, books, positions, etc.
The system is returning to normal now. The issues were display issues only. APIs unaffected.
We are continuing to monitor the situation but things are looking good now. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 17:23:30
In the event any coins are recovered firs BFX tokens then RRTs would be redeemed. 
However, you are correct to say that if a user has sold their BFX tokens and/or RRTs they won't benefit from any recovery since they chose to take the present value of their tokens and not wait for a (highly unlikely) recovery of stolen funds and possible future redemption. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:00:52
Check your facts.

@_date: 2017-11-28 17:02:22
Because Bitfinex does not hold user's USD balances as USDT, like some other exchanges. Bitfinex holds user's USD balances as USD.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:12:47


No, I mean customers wiring deposits and withdrawals into Bitfinex bank accounts.


Fiat in and fiat out is never 1:1 and never needs to be. Users hold huge USD balances that change on a daily basis. Imagine a bank that has customer funds in it. Customers deposit and withdraw daily and the amount in the vault changes.


Do you mean customer deposited funds or company balances? A lot of both. I don't know exact numbers. nine figures


@_date: 2017-11-21 16:59:27
Currently, corporate accounts can wire deposit/withdraw USD, and individuals can in some cases and in large amounts. We are working on lower the minimum amounts at this time, actually, to help restore USD wire services to more individual customers. 


@_date: 2017-11-28 05:23:37
Friedman is working on the balance sheet audit now, exactly for this reason. It is not a fast process, unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:55:54
That is boilerplate for companies that handle USD. For example what if a user that is on a terrorist watch list tries to redeem tether?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:35:59
For large volumes and institutional customers, please contact support for more info. For smaller individual customers you are correct - bank wires are not universally available. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:41:51
Fair argument. I'm not saying everyone has to trust Tether. I'm trying to answer questions and clarify misunderstandings.
I'll try to find out if those documents are available.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:07:58
If an audit won't be satisfying, what do you recommend?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:32:06


No, any time USDT is issued, the corresponding USD is sent to Tether's bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:59:06
Yes, I'm from Bitfinex. 
What is interesting is that people are "concerned" about the rise in the number of Tethers. This automatically shows that people do not understand how Tethers fundamentally work. Is anyone concerned that the price of most cryptocurrencies is going up? This is more money coming into the space, affecting all players, including Tether. Tether is the rails that many exchanges use to offer pseudo-fiat trading pairs. Tether is part of the crypto ecosystem where everything is growing together, so it makes sense that there is more demand for it as crypto grows. 
If you can crystallize what it is that makes you feel concerned about the increase in the total number of Tethers maybe I can help explain what is happening in a clear way.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:52:56
One option is to withdraw USD via Tethers. Also fiat wire withdrawals in large amounts may be possible in some cases. Please contact support to check on possibilities. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:56:46
There is a lot of misinformation about Tether floating around lately. Let me know what questions you have and I can try to help clarify.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:30:22
I'm not sure what the start date of the audit will be. But likely not back into 2015, I'd guess.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:29:45


These posts were started by one individual with a well-known personal vendetta against Bitfinex who has since garnered a cohort of others who want to believe the conspiracy. All their arguments are self-referential and recursive but at the bottom, there still exists no evidence, only fear-mongering and misapprehension by what I suspect is a malicious, not mistaken, individual. 


This is the case, yes.


Of course, Tether will release the audit as soon as it is completed by Friedman.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:57:04
I definitely sympathize with that sentiment. I think most of us are interested in crypto because of its innate trustless qualities. In my opinion, Tether is by no means off-limits to skepticism, and I am looking forward to the audit as much as most.
I think many people are elevating the FUD to level 100 because they think it is an important concern that deserves attention, and on a certain level, I respect that. 
However, I am bothered by what seems like deliberately misleading or incorrect information that seems to have ramped up recently. I try to add clarity where possible, but ultimately 3rd party audits are what is needed, and they cannot come soon enough.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:09:07
It is a common misapprehension that Bitfinex does not have banking. Institutional accounts, which are Bitfinex's primary customers, are able to move fiat in and out daily in huge amounts.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:43:38
Both Tether and Bitfinex have functioning banking relationships which institutional customers use to move significant amounts of USD in and out daily.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:42:24


This is incorrect. Between these two companies, 7 figures of USD go in and out daily. 
@_date: 2016-09-28 03:47:56
i'll check it out. Thank you
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:03:16


Actually, this tweet is about the lowering of BTC withdrawal fees, which users pay. So this is about making withdrawals cheaper for users.
@_date: 2016-09-28 03:12:41
I'd like to learn more about this. Can you recommend books or other sources? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:05:15
At the worst, you'll be barred from trading and kindly asked to withdraw your funds. The goal isn't to block user's access to their funds.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:30:38
IP and other factors, yes.

Please contact support and we'll be happy to take a look for you.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:46:54
Yes, I can understand how it would be a concern to see that the withdrawal has been completed yet the Bitcoin network or a specific block explorer isn't aware of the transaction yet. 
From Bitfinex's side, a withdrawal achieves the "completed" status when it is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network. 
We could query the mempool or various block explorers to see who has knowledge of the transaction, but that isn't something that Bitfinex (or any exchange, that I'm aware of) has focused on. 
Most transactions are detected and included in blocks in a timely manner, but occasionally there is a small delay. 
It seems blocktrail now has knowledge of the tx and is showing the details correctly. Sorry to cause any alarm in this case.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:09:18
Seems all is fine, but the transaction for the withdrawal has not yet reached the blockchain. It should resolve itself shortly. 
Sorry for the delay on this. Most of Bitfinex's transactions are prompt but occasionally there is an edge case delay like this.
