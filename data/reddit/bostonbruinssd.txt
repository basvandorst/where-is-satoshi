Bitcoin won’t hit a million, unless you mean you have a bunch.

More governments will start meddling with it when it hits $10,000+. I doubt honestly it’ll even make $50,000.

No you won't.

You'd be surprised the types of people that are so obsessed with BTC that they would do such things. It's terribly sad to see.

No, this is retarded.

If you actually plan on blowing rent money on this, then you are delusional.
