So, if you don't have 'the right to operate a motor vehicle,' nor 'the right to be drunk while operating a motor vehicle on public roads,' then what, praytell, are you bitching like a little faggot about?
Hint: the answer is nothing, you're just filling the void of of importance you experience in the real world by pretending to be smart on the internet ;)
