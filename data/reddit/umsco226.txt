I'll just quote someone who explains energy surplus better than I can.
"The vast majority of the time, electricity supply is simply matched to demand by throttling flexible power plants up and down. 
Aside from throttling load-following plants, the grid has a large reserve of standby generators available to increase supply. Utilities can also take many types of generators offline as needed to reduce supply. Demand is actually pretty straightforward to predict -- it follows regular patterns by time of day and day of week. So utilities are quite good at supply-matching when they are allowed to pick their own generation capacity mix.
Back when per-capita electricity consumption and population were both growing rapidly in the developed world, many people thought that the problem would always be struggling to build enough power plants to provide sufficient power at an economical price. Peak demand in mid-afternoon is particularly problematic because you don't want to build entire power plants just to run for a few hours a day in the hottest months of summer. The construction costs raise power rates across the board, just to provide capacity that's rarely needed. Electricity is cheapest when power plants can run non-stop -- it distributes the capital cost over more units of produced energy.
But now per-capita electricity use is dropping in the developed world, and population growth is slowing, and governments are encouraging massive construction of renewables. So the bigger issue today is over-supply. Why? Because it's not always easy to take power plants offline:
Some types of generation capacity have economics that discourage going offline, like coal plants.Some are physically difficult to take offline (and then restart) like nuclear plants.Some electricity from non-utility sources is forced into the grid regardless of demand, like wind and solar power in many jurisdictions.
Storing electricity just isn't practical. First, it's physically difficult and every method we've invented takes up a ton of space. 
Second, all energy storage and over-supply management requires some degree of waste. You're always doing one of these three things:
Losing energy in the conversion to and from a storage medium like pumped-storage hydroelectricity or battery banks, as well as all the energy and resources that went into building those storage systems
Losing energy by just dumping it, such as venting excess nuclear plant heat or shunting excess electricity directly to ground. 
Losing financial value by selling excess power at a loss and buying shortfall power at another loss (and even then, someone else's flexible generation capacity has to handle the variability)"
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:29:41
Excess power gets curtailed and spent which results in heat as well. Again with the thermodynamics part of it. We aren't creating new energy when converting excess power into heat, and when the grid dumps electricity it results in the same net effect
@_date: 2018-05-17 21:17:39
So you're arguing just to argue at this point. The utility of those applications is worth the energy consumption? Come on
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:50:09
You're identifying external marketplaces that are inherently flawed. Having tether exist does nothing to affect the internal integrity of the bitcoin network. So to say it will happen **within** bitcoin isn't true.
@_date: 2018-05-17 21:06:41
Gold is used for things other than storing wealth? Please, do inform me.
You are forgetting about mining difficulty increasing and block rewards decreasing over time in your equation.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:06:47
Many power plants or generating stations are built with surplus capacity to handle expected future increases in demand. This goes for nuclear and hydroelectric especially. I won't look everywhere for examples, but here is one from where I live
Cheap coal in China is a current issue that is unsustainable due to what they're doing to their air pollution. It is not the norm, and will not be a problem in the future. We know this will happen, because the true cost of coal is much larger than the financial rewards they are recieving from exploiting it.
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:53:05
Fair enough. Do you have any info on the real-world heat affects of bitcoin mining, or generating heat on the environment? How does it function relative to the affects of co2 or methane emissions in terms of a warming affect?

**Bitcoin mining eloquently solves this power surplus problem that exists in many areas globally. It naturally gravitates to locations with the cheapest energy costs - areas that have an energy surplus.**
*... the annual consumption of power from Bitcoin mining is 8.27 terawatt-hours per year. The global production of fiat currencies consumes 11 terawatt-hours per year.*
*Gold mining burns a staggering 132 terawatt-hours per year. What’s more, these numbers don’t even include the massive amount spent on vaults, banks, security systems and more to keep the physical cash and precious metal safe.*
**Bitcoin is NOT consuming unreasonable amounts of energy for managing a global currency.**
**The energy requirements of bitcoin mining does not increase linearly with transaction volume, thanks to second and third and fourth layer solutions like the lightning network. Through these solutions, we are able to achieve transaction volumes an order of magnitude larger, without dramatically increasing the energy requirements on the base layer - the mining itself. Don't listen to all of this news about bitcoin mining be an environmental plight, or an energy sinkhole. It's simply not true.**
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:26:57
Again, this just isn't accurate.
Where I live, we are using approximately 25% of our energy capacity. The rest is being sold to other areas, for less than we are paying for it. This is because otherwise, it would go to waste. Better to get something for it than nothing.
We are limited to who we can sell to by geography and laws of thermodynamics.
We are utilizing approximately 50% of our hydroelectric energy generation capacity currently. That means that we have 8x more energy than demand. 
If bitcoin mining consumes all of that excess, that is not a bad thing.
@_date: 2018-05-17 16:55:26
Miners naturally gravitating towards the cheapest energy, locations with an energy surplus, is the real point of the video. Miners are using energy that would otherwise go to waste.
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:10:21
You lose about 5% converting AC to DC, then another 5% converting back, not including the % lost in transit. It is better than moving AC over long distances, and is much better underwater, but is far from perfect and still results in inefficiencies that would be better solved by consuming energy at the source of its creation. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:10:47
Not true. Infrastructure to transfer energy is limited over distance due to energy being lost as it travels down a line. Energy cannot always be directed to a consumer demanding it, as it may be all "used up" as it travels en route.
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:47:27
Doesn't bitcoin mining growth occur due mostly to pockets of underutilized power production capacity? If there is energy for sale that is cheaper than other areas, miners will continue moving into the area until the power is utilized. 
A higher bitcoin price does not suddenly make bitcoin mining profitable in areas with expensive energy. It increases the number of miners, but once the number of miners hits a new equilibrium with price, the miners must exist in areas with cheap energy to remain affordable.
And those areas are areas with an energy surplus.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:29:11
In an extremely densely populated situation, sure. Again, laws of thermodynamics and distance travelled limits energy exchange programs.
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:15:36
Bitcoin can expand by orders of magnitude without dramatically increasing its mining requirements.
@_date: 2018-05-17 19:26:42
And what percentage of transactions does gold handle?
Bitcoin has the capacity to handle far more transactions than it currently does. And lightning/other 2nd, 3rd layer solutions can increase transaction capabilities by orders of magnitide, while not resulting in excess energy demands. Meaning the energy spent mining could handle all global transactions, and not require much more energy spent mining.

Pretend that bitcoin takes over for national currencies. Mining it isn't useful? Transactions need to be processed and the currency needs to be secure.
"The report indicates that the annual consumption of power from Bitcoin mining is 8.27 terawatt-hours per year. The global production of fiat currencies stands at 11 terawatt-hours per year.
Gold mining burns a staggering 132 terawatt-hours per year. What’s more, these numbers don’t even include the massive amount spent on vaults, banks, security systems and more to keep the physical cash and precious metal safe."

Not very powerful. 2 dollars or ten dollars on that transaction is essentially the same size of fee relative to the size of the transaction.
Give me a $0.001 transaction size that costs $0.00001 to send. That's genuinely powerful
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:29:57
The point of the Twitter post has nothing to do with permissionless or governments preventing a transaction. It is the size of the amount moved and the fee charged that are being professed as "powerful" when it is irrelevant
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:50:16
Microtransactions is an enormous potential marketplace that is currently entirely untapped
@_date: 2016-11-15 21:26:14
Thanks for the info. How are transaction fee rates calculated?

Custodian services will happen, and wont "take away the whole point of bitcoin."

In order for miners to totally abandon bitcoin, there needs to be a disproportionately more profitable coin to mine elsewhere. 
The money in that coin that goes to the miners must come from somewhere. This last weekend, it has come from some people who fell prey to a FUD attack from some bad actors, with ulterior motives. Attacks like this on the bitcoin network cannot be sustained long term, due to the large costs associated with it.
Miners actions are as much a centralization of power as consumer demand is. Miners actions are pure economics.

Doesn't BCH fork on the 13th? Does that effect your projection?

The size of transaction fees don't stay the same size over time in terms of bytes.

Bitcoins sum value holds true relative to your perspective about its future. What is a zero or negative sum game for you may be a positive sum game for someone who believes in its future... As for the ponzi scheme statement, you clearly don't understand what a ponzi scheme is

And improved tech. And onboarding of traditional finance through a physically backed ETF - or something similar. And national currencies in crisis. And applications/corporations accepting it as a payment method. And more improved tech. And better wallet services.

Short term, sure. Markets may be uncorrelated. Long term, we need consumer confidence in our financial systems to drop

A stock market crash is most definitely good for bitcoin. Recessions are good for bitcoin. Housing/commodities/asset crashes are good for bitcoin.
In order for the masses to adopt a new financial system, they need to lose faith in the existing one.

Is it infinitely divisible? I thought there was 64,000,000 (or some number) of satoshis in one bitcoin?

Yes for BTC. True, at full market penetration it may be possible

Well it makes loans obsolete. What is to prevent wages from being paid in bitcoin though?
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:26:09
Short term for sure, itll be x usd into btc equivalent.
Pretending that bitcoin hits some sort of total adoption though, wouldnt the value of it stabilize to the point where btc denominated wages are a reality?
Edit: and if you don't mind, can you educate me on your loan theory? I understand their existence as functioning to stimulate economic growth and feed consumption, but why are they absolutely necessary?
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:43:24
Well sure, but they increase dramatically in risk as time increases, so theyre exponentially more expensive, or so expensive that they are no longer realistic
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:07:33
It's a necessary evil of the currency. Part of the claim is that all currencies controlled and managed by men are flawed, and that decentralization is the solution
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:39:21
Practical use is as a transactable currency, you'll see it when adoption reaches the next major threshold
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:24:21
This might be a stupid question. Doesn't a hard fork - that is lacking support from a bunch of miners - leave bitcoin prone to attack?
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:37:11
Not doubting the value of loans. But in a bitcoin based system, loans are no longer feasible (or are much riskier). Obsolete is the wrong word.
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:10:51
Well it doesn't just "happen". Not all payers and payees will adopt it at once, the numbers will gradually increase over time.
