as you typed this a member bought another 150 ETH future. people are smart, not stupid, and see through your attempt to discredit the most reputable organization in the industry that actually invents things. people know ETH does not exist yet - these are clearly labeled forwards. by assuming Bitcoiners are stupid, you are the one disservicing the community. Ethereum never called us a scam, they just want to discourage people from working with us to hurt our bargaining power. they know we can get people better deals when we have bulk BTC to hold over them.

With such a device, you could exactly time the death of a planet with no worry about the failure of moving parts after attachment. You fire the pin into a planet's moon, and allow the attachment of a pre calculated length and mass to dangle in the planet's upper atmosphere for centuries. You could adjust the length and mass based on exact calculations to attain the desired fall temporals. This would prove one hell of a weapon since it is simple, exact, temporally adjustable, and has no moving parts that could fail after attachment.

Isn't this a doomsday device? The ribbon and elevator mechanisms would be subject to drag from the Earth's atmosphere. Drag on the elevator mechanisms translates to drag on the moon, slowing it down over time and enabling a fall toward the planet.

“Building this—and being the company that owns this—can be more valuable than Overstock,” 
fools. they will pay the ultimate price for their arrogance.

Bitcoin is not scalable enough to be used as a transactionary currency. Another far superior protocol trumps it.

This is a lie. They are simply playing off our git.

I have also seen identity replication: actors paid to represent players and ruin deals.

No, this is a political play by Shapeshift itself.

VB is a liar, a thief, and a conman. The World Technology Awards is now invalidated.

Exactly. I've seen everything from people inventing new identities to retroactively insert intellectual property invalidating comments in the canon to people making new identities for themselves in order to psychologically manipulate people to accept additional careers.

its sad that I have to spend time monitoring these posts and reassuring PC members. this company has existed for seven months and has paid all dues. i have more inventions and innovations to push - I don't have time for this. gerry stick with us and we will give you the world my friend.

right and our members understand that. we have every right to issue and trade forwards on a publicly offered asset. we all understand the risks. please, leave my organization alone so we can lower the barriers to foundership and continue producing real innovations, not responding to petty, emotionally charged insults. we responded to a demand and offered a valuable public service. meanwhile, you offer harassment and public defamation.
