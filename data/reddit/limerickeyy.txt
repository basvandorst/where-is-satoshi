You should tell all the websites with rating systems that no one cares about bad ratings. I'd start with Yelp, Google and Amazon. You know what they say, go big or go home!

Software development, and technology in general are always changing. Photoshop slicing used to be the right way, technology changes and now the right way is something else. And rightfully so.
The best way to learn what you need to know is to dive right in, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes. Second best way is a good CS course, as the material will be slightly dated and broad.

Don't you just love when "found a security issue" translates to "got hacked" can't believe anything you read on the anything these days.

I've done it more than once, with a business account. I even did it with an account that I opened the day before. That particular bank was extremely incompetent though, totally not surprised.

If someone has access to your bank account, you're basically screwed no matter what. There is a very short window for reversing a wire transfer, no more than a day or two. In some cases it cannot be reversed at all.
So if you don't check your account every day, you're shit out of luck. Not to mention all of the government entities who can freeze your account for a variety of reasons. Didn't pay your child support? Account frozen. Didn't pay the IRS? Account frozen. Being sued? Account frozen. You won't find out until you go to the bank or your checks start bouncing, whichever comes first.
Banks provide a false sense of security. The security you receive from Visa/Mastercard on a credit or debit card is pretty good though, in terms of unauthorized purchases at least.

Not simultaneously. One would happen immediately after the other.

One of the oldest tricks in the book.

There are a lot more people interested in Bitcoin for the genuine benefits of a decentralized digital currency. Everything will stabilize, this is just a speed bump. Investors/idiots lost some money today, hopefully they learned their lesson and stay away. The bitcoin community is not interested in short term gains. Bitcoin has the potential to be the first decentralized, global currency.
As a result of everything that has happened over the past month or two, a lot of money was put into the hands of thousands of early adopters. Hopefully they use some of their new found wealth to make Bitcoin even better. The stars aligned to make this happen.

Too late for GPU mining.

You're just speculating from the outside. Take a look at any of the marketplaces, stores, or websites that people use to spend their bitcoin. They are thriving more than ever. The prices are anchored to the USD, and the vendors understand the risks of not cashing out your bitcoin quickly.
None of this would fly for a real currency, but does Bitcoin look like your standard every day government-backed currency? The rules are different. Growing pains are to be expected. No one said a revolution was gonna be easy. I'm glad the people involved, the early adopters, are some of the smartest engineers in the world.
My personal opinion about other crypto currencies is that there is only room for one, and Bitcoin is lightyears ahead of everyone else. The traction that Bitcoin has is priceless. Companies have spent 100M on marketing and received far less.

Security through obscurity doesn't work. Your whole theory centers around the insane notion that you are safer because less people use it. In reality it makes you statistically more likely to get caught. You are one the "idiots"

Ding ding ding, we have a winner.
There is no need to waste time making up hypothetical scenarios. You should not be speaking to the cops, they are not on your side. Do not tell them anything. You are under no obligation to say anything to them or assist them in any way. I know first hand that emotions go crazy when shit hits the fan, but you have to keep your shit together and close your mouth. Your freedom depends on it.

The $ stands for dollar, so you wouldn't use it when describing BTC. It would just be 100 BTC.

I was only speaking in a general sense. How many transactions do you think are eligible for a refund anyways? Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands? Assuming they came forward and asked for it.

People use Bitcoin to buy things from Silk Road. Thousands of transactions every day. I know dozens of developers who get paid in Bitcoin too, even a year ago. It's not a pyramid scheme just because you don't understand it or its uses.

Your Skype username leads me to ChosenRewards on hackforums. Which leads to buybitcoinwithsms.com, which has a phone number associated with it that leads me to this:  (where you say you are only 17 years old)

I don't think you fully understand how an exchange works. Your money is sent to a bank account owned by an exchange, either directly or through an intermediary like ZipZap/WU, and the exchange credits your account with BTC. You haven't lost any of your protection.
