Just because you have the password for github/bitcoin doesn't make you the most popular. I didn't elect them and they didn't create bitcoin.

I agree in principle. But the network is a prisoner dilemma type situation. The value depends on how much we believe others won't dump and decide we won't dump too.

I'm excited for segwit, but how many channels will actually be set up within the next month? Me transferring between my wallets will not create a channel, nor will one-off payments. I'm willing to concede we don't need the 2x if the mempool dries up and fees go down. But is core willing to consider 2x if fees are rising and the mempool is filling?

I have a feeling when an ETF is approved it will be denominated in mBTC

Everyone has to remember even as wallstreet money flows in, we are still the ones who control bitcoin. They can sell all the futures they want, but if we hold and refuse to sell the price won't fall and they will go broke.

The US government doesn't bail out commodity speculators very often.

You may want to edit the amounts in your post, I just found the transaction by searching

Who elected the current core developers? These are not the developer names I remember from years ago. What is consensus? The market wants bigger blocks, the miners want bigger blocks, many of the users want bigger blocks. I see a handful of unelected leaders standing in our way. Fix it or quit.

With the Lightning Network, what happens if a client loses a transaction before its written to disk. Like if the power goes out or it crashes. Do other clients store transactions its not related too?
An example:
Client A creates a channel with Client B. They each put in 1 BTC. B pays A for something and the balances become A = 1.5 and B = 0.5. A's computer loses power and loses the transaction signed by B. A asks B for transaction again, and B is being a dick and won't give the info again. When the channel expires B gets back its original 1 BTC because A can't come up with the transaction to get its extra 0.5 BTC.

It doesnt matter if they don't currently have segwit. As soon as lighting network is working, bitcoin cash can just add the code in.
Core needs to step up and fix this.

Good, then prove it. If core set a timeline for a 2x increase I guarantee the miners would postpone the hard fork and everyone would be happy.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:38:23
Can you imagine how high the fees are going to be if most of the miners stick with 2x? Small blocks every 100 min for months. That is fucking scary. Core needs to swallow their pride and stop this. If a large consensus of miners was enough to create the hardfork that added segwit, why is another large consensus of miners not enough to go 2x?

Not if they won't let you

I think when the ETF happens it should be denominated in mBTC, that will help people get used to different units.
