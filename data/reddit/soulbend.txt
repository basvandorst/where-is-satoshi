What kind of moron would try and scam someone who uses bitcoin? I don't use it, but from what I can tell, most people who avidly use the currency are tech-savvy and internet-savvy people. This guy chose the wrong community to scam.
edit: There are multiple people telling me otherwise. I was offering the opinion of an outsider, so whoever wants to discuss this in depth, feel free.

It has to be taxed. I don't understand what point you are trying to make, because I already explained this in my first post.

They should. We should. All for all. Every minute of our lives, looking out for each other, even if we don't agree. Our government is fucked, so everything I say is null in today's American reality, but that is the ideal way to exist, and it's the only way I want to live. I've seen so many people desperate for help. Most of them don't vote. They don't give a shit about you or me. But they are human beings and they deserve life just as much as the richest person on Earth.
edit: I'd love to debate this further with you but I have to go. Sorry :(

If giving my opinion on Reddit is standing on a moral pedestal, then YOU'RE FUCKING RIGHT, and you are doing the same exact thing by dismissing my opinion. I don't want anybody arrested, that's a gross misunderstanding of what I said, and every bit as paranoid as I am every day. You and me are the same, and I don't donate because I am one of those people in need of help. Does that make you want to dismiss me? Am I below you? Am I a lesser person than you are?

I would gladly and proudly pay those taxes for my fellow men and women. If someone is too weak to bring themselves to help themselves, they still deserve the support of us all. If you don't prescribe to that, then you are absolutely vindictive and selfish. We are all the same people, even those of us who are damaged, violent and ignorant. PERIOD.

TAXES ARE THE BOOGEYMAN AND SO IS RESPECTING PEOPLE WHO CAN'T FEND FOR THEMSELVES. NIGGERS. WELFARE QUEENS. ARABS CHINESE AND INDIANS. NECKBEARDS. REDNECKS. JUDGE THEM ALL AND LET THEM BE HOMELESS WHILE YOU RISE ABOVE AND TAKE WHAT IS YOURS. There are black and white objectives rising in this country. It's not just democrats and republicans. It's have vs have nots, and vengeance vs forgiveness. Mark my words, this is the dividing line that we will all face in the years to come. Take your side and hate all others.
