Worst part is that I had a 100% secure offline wallet but I moved the coins temporarily since I needed to manipulate them easily for a short while.

Thank you for the kind words, obviously only choice I have is to keep moving forward and deal with life as it comes.

I only put in 300$ initially as I mined a certain altcoin which exploded which made me 25 btc. From there I traded my way up and had a goal of 100 btc (this was when price was in the 300 range). With 100 btc I was hodling till kingdom come.

I had close to 100 btc stolen from me through teamviewer last year. All my "security" was close to useless once they had direct acces to my computer. I had a copy of my seed words in lastpass behind 2fa but that didn't matter. Stupid mistake on my part and I keep looking at the price which just increases severe anxiety and panic attacks I've been having since it happened. 
Good luck op.

Lastpass was logged in already and teamviewer was hacked last year..

The anxiety is horrible but like you said I also smile cause I love bitcoin, like really love the technology and am so excited about it. It's fun to have been right but would be better if I had the rewards too.

The lastpass extension was logged in on my computer which meant that all they had to do was open up my secure note directly, no password prompt or 2fa required since the vault was open.

This.

I had an offline armory wallet and then electrum actually. I added the seed words temporarily to a lastpass secure note because I needed easier access temporarily and felt safe with 2fa etc. First person to blame is myself and then the people who steal.

Yeah I am, I'd say I'm functioning normally 95% of the time but sometimes I think about it and just get angry or cringe really hard. It's a stupid amount of money now, even more than I thought possible.
I found around 27 coins of a certain altcoin the other day hidden away in a wallet.dat file i was sure I had checked before and they are worth 2.1 btc which is still huge. That felt good honestly, I'm now checking all my wallets frantically to see if I have more.
At one point I had 4200 of that coin which is like 1.5 million $ right now or something (งツ)ว
