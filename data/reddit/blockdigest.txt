Apparently he did download a pirated videogame. It's common that these sort of things contain viruses. I bet the antivirus didn't detect it, the attacker copied the wallet and cracked the password protecting it.

lol where did you get that? Only the coins are different (ofc they can be used in any country). Paper bills are all the same.

It is not legal to operate a Bitcoin ATM in Greece. You need at least a foreign currency exchange license from Bank of Greece and even then you could be sued or raided by the tax authorities.

The amount of bitcoins created every hour is not always 150... The correct answer should be "Not a fixed amount".
@_date: 2015-06-20 23:24:18
That's 2008-2011 stale FUD. No evidence. Look I want BTC to succeed too but the truth should be above all.
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:20:44


For the n^th time. If this happens, there is no Bitcoin anymore (everyone is mining on different forks, consensus breaks, double spends, etc).


I don't understand why would you reject a block if everyone else is accepting it (you will be left behind). There should not be any uncertainty about the validation of blocks you send or receive.
@_date: 2015-06-21 18:11:37
Just checked. They don't allow you to create an account without providing a phone number. Maybe you got lucky and got an account before they implemented such measures. Bottom line is that you don't really need an email account to exchange coins (e.g. shapeshift)
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:31:10
Correct, they can put a limit which is less than the maximum on the blocks they create. But this amount of control does not extend to what is a valid block and what is not.
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:08:26
512 MB RAM is less than the UTXO set. Node will crash at some point.
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:39:06
If i understand correctly, if every miner could set their own size limit for blocks that they think are valid this would break consensus and result in uncontrollable forking. That's the reason everyone should run clients that agree on such fundamentals.
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:43:43


The number is not random. Its a function of all the parameters a miner is concerned with while balancing quick block propagation and fees paid by transactions. This number is unique to every miner as everyone is mining in more or less different environments. That's why if everyone set their own limit it would be different (even if the difference is 1 byte it would result in forking).
Again you are missing the point of consensus. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 23:58:53
Unfortunately you need at least a foreign currency exchange license according to the Bank of Greece. Keep safe, you never know when SDOE is gonna come knocking.

@_date: 2015-06-12 13:20:40
How mining would work in that case? Do miners have to mine 2 different blocks or is it like merged mining?
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:08:48


Nope. Most bills in Greece are Greek anyway...
@_date: 2015-06-14 22:33:27
OK i think i know what you are trying to say.


Basically remove the block size limit and only reject the blocks that you think maybe be harmful. Ignoring scalability issues, this would only work if you had no reject policy for block size. If you leave it up to individuals to set the limit of harmful block size this will break the [consensus rules]( again.
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:53:36
If it is hard coded then everyone agrees on what is a valid block. If miners could select their own number, then they would not agree on what is a valid block and everyone would start mining on different forks depending on their set limit (consensus is broken).
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:44:21
No stories in the news recently. The vast majority of Greeks are oblivious about Bitcoin.
There is a Greek documentary (with subs) about bitcoin featuring the FinMin:

I would go with B. 
People handling Bitcoin directly would only apply to certain niche applications, so no big surprise looking at merchant adoption (credit cards work decently at brick and mortar businesses if you have access to banking).
I believe the "killer app" would be Machine-to-Machine payments and authentication applications of all sorts. I think 21 inc is on the right path by removing the need for customers to purchase bitcoin directly via  exchanges, which is a big nuisance and barrier to Bitcoin use and adoption. Instead they cleverly bypass KYC/AML regulations with mining, although it may not be profitable mining it would be sufficient to obtain a few satoshis needed for M2M authentication/payment applications.
@_date: 2015-05-04 11:26:09
I don't understand whats the big fuzz about this under the hood changes.
If someone does not want to accept the changes they can always mine, transact and develop in the old fork. You are not forced to change anything if the block size does not fit your purpose, and on the other hand you can not force other people to reject those changes.
That's the beauty of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-09 13:08:11
This does not make a lot of sense. How is this exactly like difficulty retarget, since network difficulty is there to keep Bitcoin inflation predictable. What does this scheme accomplish?
@_date: 2015-05-04 18:20:04
He is actually pretty close. According to Joseph Poon they need about 133 MB blocks to run "unlimited" number of transactions on the lightning network.
@_date: 2015-05-05 01:14:58
Why would you want to trade such an asset while you can trade the underlying asset much easier? I don't get it.

No one is running a 20 MB block node yet. You could in theory use Gavin's code and compile bitcoind but then you would create a fork that only you are using.
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:35:03
VC money could be a loan but usually it is stake in the company. Plus if you get a loan from the bank you will not gain any connections or assistance from them.
@_date: 2015-05-09 02:14:04
Any miner can stop adding transactions if they see that the block is getting too big to relay to the network. No one is forcing them to make big blocks.
@_date: 2015-05-10 12:41:08
Sorry i meant fork the code... But if they mined with that code they would also create a network fork that only they are using.

I was thinking the same thing. I think he understands it and he may even have some, although he will never admit it publicly. Also the look on the faces of the audience is dumbfounded because they have no clue what bitcoin is (and obviously Giani is not going to explain it on a peasant-politics TV program but instead try to crack a joke and play it cool).

Sounds like he has second thought about open sourcing it.

Let's assume that the block size is increased. If the Chinese government really cared about bitcoin mining wouldn't they just give fast internet connections to miners rendering the block size increase irrelevant?
@_date: 2015-08-04 12:59:48
Other cryptocurrencies are irrelevant. Actually irrelevant news are ok.
@_date: 2015-08-03 12:36:27
You really think that there are no fast connections in China? You really think that the Chinese government has to talk to ISP to get on tier 1 networks? Absolutely no, they control all of that and they provide it to anyone who would serve their purposes. However i do not think that the Chinese gov cares about bitcoin mining at all. "Leveling" the playing field by increasing the block size to a point that adversely affects Chinese miners would be a dirty tactic that would prove collusion between western developers and miners to cut off the Chinese.

Opinions are fine but when someone claims to be the "press" you expect at least some objectivity and equal discussion of both sides. When the editorial supporting the no is translated in 4 languages and that's the only "news" about the referendum covering their front page, one can only wonder why they don't just start a multi-lingual blog and be done with it, at least that's more honest for people who want to donate. If you want to read and listen to the mouthpiece of a leftist government there are plenty of choices, and the press project is one of them. I distinctly remember the change of tone towards the government as soon as syriza came to power.
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:04:02
There are 2 opinions yes/no. Obviously from their front page they only represent the no view (government).
@_date: 2015-07-16 19:58:13
If its a programming language why they sell "pre-sale" tokens?
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:56:59
When people don't want to understand you cannot make them see both sides. Even when you put in front of them reasonable concerns, they just dismiss them because they think larger blocks will magically propel Bitcoin value and/or solve convoluted scalability issues. They just want bigger blocks, bigger market, bigger returns and they want them now. Btw I completely agree with your analysis and the fact that the block size should be raised, but in a different, more sophisticated, and thought out way.

Sure thing, but RNGs can be tested and if you are not satisfied with the results you can switch to another CPU. If you are even more paranoid, you can then take an electronic microscope and use it to examine and reverse-engineer the CPU in order to reveal its inner workings.

@_date: 2015-04-08 14:14:24
Well the attack vector would probably be malicious RNG, not actual control over machines. Is there any evidence to suggest that intel or any other CPU manufacturer would put a backdoor in their products?

You can import the private keys to Bitcoin Core and get the public keys through that (no coding required).
