Actually I dont think I really get the whole argument. There is too much fud floating around. Maybe ill just go through the bitcoin white paper in detail and work up from there. 
Thanks for your comments anyhow.

Can someone explain how big is blockexplorer site ? Like compared to coinmarketcap, coinbase etc. - how much traffic/authority do they have relatively ?

Thanks for the comments. Some more questions.


Is mempool the same as RAM ? My assumption was that the blocks are stored in a node - so bigger blocks means more storage means higher cost per node. But are you suggesting that blocks are stored in RAM, so segwit reduces that requirement and hence increases transactions/block making each node more efficient. 


Why can't I just plug my PC in and join a mining pool. If a PC doesnt work then I can get a graphics card. A graphics card is just another $200 or so. I am fine making $10 a day on that investment.

Its not about usability. Lightening does not make sense conceptually. LN requires any two users to either setup a payment channel or join a payment cluster - How do you explain that to a typical user that now he has to 'manage' a channel instead of just handing over some bills to do a transaction.
The problem with LN is that its default use case will degenerate to a transaction managed through a payment provider. This provider already exists. Its called a 'bank'.

Basically what LN degenerates to is to using a payment provider. The problem is that we already have those. Why do we need LN at all ?

I just understood lightning yesterday and I for one don't think it is a good thing. I think we need a HODL on lightning.
Lightning protocol is complicated. It took me sometime to get my head around it - and I am the smartest guy I know. If something is complicated for me - It is complicated for almost everyone. 
The complication is OK - as long is the user experience is not. 
The complication is still OK - as long as you have nothing to loose.
Lightning is complicated for now and fails on both these metrics. Bitcoin might be old for you guys, but Bitcoin is still in its infancy. It needs to be the grown up version of what it already is. If Bitcoin tries to do lightning - I am afraid it will get stuck in the middle. It will neither be lightning nor will it be what it is now.
We just saw a pump and dump yesterday. More attacks are coming. Winter is here. Bitcoin needs to keep its fort and hodl its stance. This is not the time to conquer new lands. 
EDIT: Sorry I didnt meant to brag. I was just trying to be factual. I must admit I dont completely understand how LN works. I found it incredibly complicated to understand. I could be wrong though - I am frequently. Can anyone explain to me quickly what hte user experience of LN is ? How is it superior to fiat today ?

Its not about coming up with a name. How do you explain it conceptually ? 
Bitcoin is easy to explain - everyone has an address, like an email address and you send money to that address.
Can you explain to me what is a payment channel ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:39:12
Not very sure. This is what my understanding is:
Open a channel = move money into a chequing account specific to the person you are transacting with.
So with every person you want to transact, you open a new chequing account. For the vast majority of the cases ppl will want to open and close immidiately. The only way this works is if you have low fees, in which case there is no point of lightning.
The only other way it works is with a payment provider - who is basically a trusted middle men. The thing is that there are companies which already do this, so again you dont need lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:54:24
Yes but the resources getting deployed on LN are better spent on upgrading bitcoin.

What is a payment channel ? How do you explain it conceptually to a user ? I think when you use the words 'payment channel' you have lost the user.

Why cant you just encrypt the mnemonic and store it online ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:43:41
I agree this is how it will end up eventually. The issue I have is that this is already a solved problem. We dont need lightening for this. There are already payment providers (like Visa, banks etc) which will act as middlemen and provide currency translation and settlement services. In fact the current solution is better because these payment providers will give you currency in local fiat which is more suitable by geography.

Sorry I didnt meant to brag. I was just trying to be factual. I must admit I dont completely understand how LN works. I found it incredibly complicated to understand.
When I first looked at bitcoin - it made obvious sense. It is superior to what we have today or I could see it being superior in the future. LN, I just dont see that. Fiat works better than LN for smaller transactions - and imo bitcoin should be ok with that.
I could be wrong though - I am frequently.

LOL. Bankers need to loose their jobs already.

It is besides the poing that bcc resembles the bitcoin paper or not. 
The bitcoin paper was written as a conceptualisation of the blockchain currency. What BTC is right now is a global store of value  and a community of people who have ideas more evolved on BTC interaction with the real world. There is little value in limiting the growth of bitcoin to what was outlined in the original paper. 
We need to look at bitcoin to what it has become and plan from there rather than adhering to an ideological bias which might not have enough relative acceptance in the real world.
