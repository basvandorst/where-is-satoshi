No one thinks it's a good idea. It's just that no one has tens of thousands to throw down on school

A 50% increase on my taxes for free college education would be well worth it in my book.

Well that only proves my point. The "argument" I can't stand is the one that says we pay less in taxes and that's how it oughta be. That's how it oughta be but not with more ~~incentives~~ results wtf

Don't get me wrong. I'm a married 24 year old home-owner whose hair is falling out and beard is going grey. I know the struggle! And if I only had to pay a bit more in taxes to avoid the growing, looming shadow of college debt, I sure would be much more at peace.

Oh, no, I think you misunderstood or I mis~~spoke~~typed. Covering tuition with taxes wouldn't be more expensive than paying for tuition out of pocket, for most Americans I'm sure, again by no means an expert. I just think if some countries have it figured out, same with healthcare, it's obviously possible, and we should really really be questioning those who are resisting this shift.

Obama chuckled, "You mean the CHAOS EMERALDS?!"

Seriously, as an American I can't understand this argument. I'll finish school with over $50,000 in debt. That's ~~about half of the~~ ***taxes***. If I had to pay more in taxes and not only get roads, school for my kids, and healthcare for those who need it but *also* free college, I'd be all over that. No contest. 
edit: I'm hardly an economics expert. All I know is I'm paying out the ass for school *and* taxes, and there are countries that have this shit figured out.

It's stressful. I worry what kind of life I'll be able to provide for my future children because I expect that, for the rest of my adult life, I'll be paying hundreds of dollars a month for student loans, when people in Germany students can walk out with an undergrad degree and hardly $5k in debt.
