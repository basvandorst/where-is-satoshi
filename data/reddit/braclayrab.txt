Doesn't the entire network need to know about every channel in order to do the routing? As far as I know, that is the current implementation(source routing).
If there are plans to do something more like IP/BGP, I haven't seen any details other than that the whitepaper said they will use something like BGP. Are there any docs defining who is a relevant party? I'd love to see something like that so we can put this LN scaling debate to rest.

Are they trolling? He must have attached the miner's fee for the taco but then he didn't attach it when he sent BTC to Robocoin...
If his wallet didn't suck he could have gotten around this problem by simply redoing the transaction and attaching the fee, so this isn't really a long-term issue.
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:58:04
Any node can actually independently verify the validity of a transaction instantaneously. There are only two dangers once a transaction is posted to the network. The first is that it's never included in a block because there was no fee attached(the fee can simply be checked to solve this). The second is that it was a malicious double spend and the other transaction might make it into a block before this one. I doubt maybe people will really attempt this, but for large purchases, waiting for 1 or 2 confirmations would solve it.

I would add to this: loans, peer-to-peer loans, stock markets, bond markets, financial contracts, micro-transactions, remittences, crowdfunding(on the fly crowdfunding?)...
The list goes on and on. The thing about asking "What are the applications" is that it's like asking "What are the applications of email". You might have said in 1985 something like "we won't have to pay for stamps anymore". But how many different applications in the world are enabled by email today? By tcp/ip? The list is nearly endless and there are startups formed every day that in some way use email and tcp/ip. The same will be true for bitcoin. There are applications we can't even dream up yet because the scope of possibilities is just too big. 
Keep this in mind also, if email replaces and enhances functions of the post office, then bitcoin replaces and enhances parts of the banking industry. Which of these two technologies should have a more profound impact on the world? The post office is a very important institution, but the banking industry runs the world...

Hard to answer this... I would simply say that the protocol is actually quite simple, about as complex as TCP/IP, maybe slightly more complex. With something this simple, it's easy to understand that it isn't hackable if you can really fully understand it. Unfortunately, it takes quite a bit of knowledge in software/comp.sci. before you can make that assessment yourself. However, you can at least tell someone that people like Marc Andreesen, Paul Graham and Tim Berners-Lee are pro-bitcoin.
Additionally, you can point out that the 'protocol' underlying the 'dollar' system are much weaker. Hacking a bank would be much easier than hacking the blockchain.

It is no longer efficient to mine bitcoin with GPUs, the cost of electricity to run your computer would be greater than the profits made in bitcoin. Bitcoin mining these days is done with specialized FPGAs that can mine very efficiently.
Litecoin's mining algorithm, however, is specifically designed to be mined efficiently by GPU+RAM, so that typical consumer PCs are viable for mining. However, most Litecoin mining is done by top-end GPUs and your laptop would probably mine &lt; $50/year, which is probably greater than the cost of electricity. You can find hash/s charts for various GPUs and try to calculate it if you're interested.

@_date: 2014-04-05 14:55:31
No, this is completely wrong.
The fed works by a network of trust. Banks are allowed to borrow money directly from the Discount Window(the fed) and the Fed sets a universal interest rate for that money. No one is given 'free money'. When people are very 'bullish' about the future economy, they're eager to borrow money from banks and then the fed can set the Discount Rate higher. People are confident that their newly borrowed money, once invested, will return enough to cover the high interest rates. When people are feeling very negative, bearish, about the future, then no one wants to borrow. At this point, the fed sets the rate lower, even nearly 0%, to strongly encourage borrowing.
The purpose of the Discount Rate is to let the Feds have a brake/gas-like control on the very fickle, self-reinforcing, mood of the public. If this control is not in place, you can end up with giant bubbles and crashes that create things like the great depression.
In this system, no one is really 'stealing' from the 99%. Yes, the bankers are in a position of priveledge, but they aren't allowed to just say 'hey, Fed, gimme $100 for dinner', they all need to keep books and demonstrate where the money is gone, and additionally, they need to pay back any borrowed money to the Fed.
The Fed is in another position of privledge because it's the only entity which is actually allowed to print IOUs/Dollars, but again, that doesn't mean Ben Bernanke or that new lady just print dollars and give them out as christmas presents. Ultimately, we, as mortgage-takers and new-business-starters, can be the recipients of these loans, you only have to demonstrate that you're a responsible member of society.

@_date: 2014-03-25 21:50:11
IMO, importing the private key is the best way to do this.
You could, in theory, produce a transaction that sends half the coins to a new address and half back to the original address. However, in order to produce such a transaction, you'd need to import the private key into some sort of wallet or at least some code that will build the transaction for you... i.e. the address must be made 'hot' in order to send half of the or all of them, so you might as well just do it the right way and import the private key and then create a new paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:07:54
You should still be able to open it. Anyway, even if the wallet.dat data format changes, you can just unencrypt it and take the private key out using any text-editor(worst case scenario). I'm not sure what sort of encryption bitcoind and bitcoin-qt use, but I'm sure it's something standard.
You should also be able to unencrypt your wallet with bitcoind or bitcoin-qt without resyncing the entire blockchain. You can likely even send from your old wallet to your new Electrum wallet without syncing. Good luck!

This is apples and oranges. OpenSSL is an implementation of SSL, a very complex system. sha-256 is just a hash function, it doesn't have features like a "heartbeat request" where you can send a command to it and it returns data to you, it's just a single function.
Edit: to put it another way, SSL is a construction of software engineering. Lots of players, lots of specifications, lots of lines of code. sha-256 is a construction from computer science, one or two guys came up with the function, and it's specification is very tiny compared to something like SSL. It's like comparing a built-bridge vs a mathematical model of steel beams...

That's an interesting perspective... If we view all of bitcoin like a security and assume it held it's value over the last 3 months, the total capitalization of our 'security' was ~12M bitcoins and the total dividend the 'company' has made over the last 3 months is 324000BTC(25 BTC * 6 ten-min-blocks/hr * 24 hrs * 90 days). If this was a company, we're making a great profit!
10.8% per annum!
Of course, all the dividends are going to the miners and aren't in an sense being reinvested. :(
I'm sure someone would say that more mining equipment = reinvestment, but sadly this isn't really right, the 'company' doesn't gain any actually functionality by having more mining equipment in the same was a company would by hiring people, buying assets, etc...
In another sense though, the fact that we can sustain a 10% dividend is very nice, shows the strength of the market and this dividend is decreasing every day.

The algorithm ensures the consistency of the distributed database(the blockchain).
The algorithm for mining creates incentive for honest mining.
Once a miner 'solves' a new block, he wants to get that solution transmitted quickly so that it will become the top of the blockchain. Blocks not in the longest chain are not part of the blockchain and therefore the 25BTC reward for such blocks is not part of the blockchain. Other miners accept the solved block because it's easy to verify the solution and they themselves want to put their next solved block on top of it so that they will also be part of the longest chain.
If a miner rejects a legitimately solved block, they are solving on top of a chain that will likely never catch up with the "real" longest chain, i.e. the one agreed on by the honest 51%.

For the last 5 years, Mortgage rates have been &lt; 3%. This is basically free money if you can only invest it in a house that will track inflation(~3%). No one wanted this money though because they're all bearish about the housing market.
Additionally, *no person can get a 0% interest rate*, not because the system is rigged but because people have very, very different risk profiles from banks. The chance that a bank will default is much lower than a person.

Poor people keep no cash-on-hand. Inflation only effects the value of cash, not the value of assets. Inflation hurts the rich more than the poor. Really though, none of this matters because inflation does so little damage to anyone that it's not even worth mentioning. If you want to consider inflation like a tax, then it represents maybe .01% of my tax burden.

Anyone can trivially check the validity of a transaction once it's in the network.
The only risk of accepting an unconfirmed transaction would be that it's a double spend, intentional or accidental. However, the legitimacy of the transaction does not need to be confirmed, it is **impossible** for you to fake a transaction from a private key that you don't own.
If someone doesn't attach a fee then their transaction won't be included by any miner, then they can resend a transaction using the same inputs and 'respend' them. This isn't really a double-spend, but technically it's sorta similar, i.e. a transaction is accepted as legit but it never makes it into the blockchain. This is what I'm referring to as an 'accidental double spend'.
For most purchases, an unconfirmed transaction is probably fine. If double-spend attacks really become a problem, then we'll have to find workarounds, but I actually seriously doubt this will ever be a major problem, and workarounds are obvious.

If the 770k coins were not stolen, then Gox only lost some coins through malleable transactions over the course of a few days, which means they still hold most of their assets, even though they may be insolvent. The rumors caused a run, they aren't completely broke.

The problem with Bitcoin as a currency is that it's impossible to use as a "unit of account". If a currency is in hyper-inflation then no one give loans, if a currency is in hyder-deflation then no one will take loans. Since Bitcoin is right now experiencing 1000% yearly value increase, it impossible to take out a mortgage using it or to use it to found a company. These large-loans serve a very very important function for modern society, obviously.
Now, in the future Bitcoin *might* create a big enough services market to bootstrap itself to a large enough pool of liquidity to stabilize over the course of years. After *years* of stabilization then it could be used for loans and long-term-contracts, but to say that this will 'definitely happen' is speculation about a lot of factors. Calling economists "dumb" and saying they "don't understand Bitcoin" is very shortsighted. I *personally* believe that bitcoin will eventually reach the level of a 'unit of account', but this is only in the very long term.
The problem with the libertarians that inundate the Bitcoin community is that they think they understand economics but they really only understand the tip of the iceberg. They haven't really thought about these issues at all and haven't truly examined the depth of their understanding. Inflation is not robbery unless you keep a pile of $100 bills under your mattress. 3% inflation of my cash-on-hand in 2013 is probably a loss of about $100 in value. Obviously, my income tax burden is much higher than this, $100 is an ignorable sum and the **Federal Reserve system is the most fair and sophisticated banking system in the history of the world**. So please, before you draw some poorly-defined venn-diagram, really think about what fiat can do that bitcoins can't and how important those things are. At this point in time, that venn-diagram should probably be flipped around.

Mt Gox had a flaw in their implementation of the bitcoin protocol. This allowed someone to trick Gox's internal accounting system and they were able to get Gox to send them the same payment more than once.
This, of course, has caused a lack of confidence in Gox, but additionally they made some bad PR mistakes. First, they halted trading without any statements. Then, when they finally did make a statement they blamed the bitcoin protocol. However, the issue which they pointed to was a known issue with a workaround. They failed to implement the workaround properly in their own software and therefore can't really blame anyone but themselves.

There have been a ton of stories about MtGox and their issues with a flaw in their bitcoin related to what is called "malleable transactions". I don't want to get into all the details because it's a long story at this point, but it suffices to say to answer your question that the cost of arbitrage to MtGox is very high. In fact, since withdrawals of any sort are disable right now on MtGox, it's completely impossible to do arbitrage. You might say the cost of arbitrage is 100%. Additionally, even if it is possible to do withdrawals, Gox is saying it will be on Monday, there is a risk-cost with any funds held by MtGox because they have been scammed out of some coins via this transaction malleability issue and no one can be sure that they are still solvent.

@_date: 2014-04-21 13:41:51
I think sweeping is when you import a private key and them immediately move the coins to a more secure address... Not sure.
An address is a private-key public-key pair. The coins in an address are entries in the public blockchain. Any wallet that has a copy of the private key can post transactions with the public key because it's able to sign the transaction with the private key. Of course, once the transaction is in a block, the other wallet would not be able to re-spend the coins.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:56:22
Yes, but your client might not allow it. The default client automatically removes unconfirmed inputs from your balance. In theory though, if you use the same inputs and attach a fee, then the fee'd transaction will be put into the blockchain and the non-fee one would become invalid and miners would drop it.

It's simply up to the client to add the fee or not. You could transmit a no fee transaction to the network but no miner would include it in a block. The fee should be configurable, imo.

Okay, thanks for the info. It doesn't really matter though, to the end-user it looks exactly the same, call it one channel or two. Both systems require an onchain tx to create any outbound funds and there is no incentive for a large hub or merchant to create outbound funds toward edge users.

That's quite a honeypot... I wonder what datacenter they're running in, what OS they're using, and what other software may be installed on the machine.
LN nodes must sign real BTC tx in realtime, therefore these 50(or is it 500?) coins are vulnerable to anyone with root access to the server.
LN, in addition to having a shitty UX and an unscalable architecture, also has a shitty security model. The attack surface for your onchain transactions is your trezor, the attack surface for a LN node is the entire server. The coins on this server \*are\* vulnerable, it's just a matter of time until a 0-day is found on any system as complex as an entire server.
Here is a citation for my claim regarding scalability, since I know at least one person will doubt that:
[ as of Nov 2017 "source routing is in the spec". This is still the case, afaik. Nothing beyond source routing has been specced.
[ here Rusty Russell refers to source routing as "spray and pray" and admits it will never scale.

With LN, you need 1 node per user. With Blockchain, you can support many users on a few miners.
Not sure what you mean by "broadcast network". What is your specific concern? Transactions are broadcast once, they are not re-broadcast by each receiver. It's a bit tricky to scale because you want every node to see every transaction, but it's theoretically scalable, unlike LN source-routing.
@_date: 2018-11-17 11:10:29

How much were the fees in December? How much will they be in 1 year? 2 years?

$1 for ice cream and $3 in fees! But, of course, why would you spend your Store of Value^tm
@_date: 2018-07-11 02:58:46
Killer use case is cash.
Visa fees bro. If you are a restaurant, your margin is low, e.g 5% i.e., you gotta spend $100 to make to make $105. Now Visa comes along and say they want 1% of your transactions...

Stealing bitcoins is like stealing cash. I wouldn't call theft a form of fraud. In the case of credit cards, the card info is 'stolen', but really it's fraud, the person using the credit card is using someone else's line of credit.

Theft != Fraud

This is a strange assertion with no obvious reasoning and no explanation... Why would that be? I'm pretty sure Apple's marketing team would be doing their damnedest to NOT have a story like that run, so what would the pressure be FOR it to run?

Yep, it really is no wonder that merchants have to pay a 2%+ in fees.

It will never scale in a decentralized way. Every transaction changes the network topology. The spec is still only for source routing, so even if it's theoretically scalable(it isn't), they haven't even tried to design a scalable solution yet, let alone built it.

This is because of the regular banking system and the Know Your Customer laws. Once you've got an exchange set-up and working, it feels much nicer. It sort of funny to recognize why these laws are needed while in the process of finding a technological solution that makes them obsolete...

I'm sorry, but the "everyone gets poorer" argument is completely wrong. How many dollars are you holding? I typically only have $1000-$10000 in my bank account. If you've got enough cashing sitting around that inflation is really making you poorer, then you are very far from poor to begin with.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:42:55
All short term issues. Eventually, it may be possible with bitcoin that you can request a credit line from your social connections or issue personal 'bonds' on your bitcoin-based-credit-history. It may eventually be easier to get paid in bitcoins than in cash, right now I need a bank account to get paid or else I need to use a check cashing service. Isn't this similar to the difficulty of getting bitcoins through exchanges? Your viewpoints are short-sighted in my opinion. We're all early adopters so things are difficult. If you disagree, ping me after my next payday and I'll cash you out. :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:22:01
Why? The only advantage BTC has is bigger market cap, i.e. first movers advantage, which is gone now. What else is superior about BTC?

They're only needed when transferring between dollars.

"Then there is the issue of how limited the supply of bitcoin truly is. Bitcoin is digitally “mined” by computers running an algorithm. (If you just rolled your eyes, you’re not alone.) "
This part made me buy another $1000 worth.

@_date: 2013-12-20 20:36:47
No. It's a protocol and it's decentralized like the internet(tcp/ip) or like bittorrent.

Wall Street is just capital management. We need more capital in Bitcoins.

Perhaps some extra business for being an early adopter and new bitcoin users wanting to try it out. Also, Visa fees are 1.5%, which is nothing to sneeze at.
As a bitcoin enthusiast, I would say that eventually people will start using crytocurrency-based credit card, most likely based on bitcoin. Some time after that your customers will simply demand that you support bitcoin. Why not save 1.5% on some of your transactions in the meantime?
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:48:47

Well, TCP/IP is a lot simpler than bitcoin... But, yeah, your point is mostly valid, network effects will eventually increase the value of bitcoin and the cost of switching to an altcoin to the point where a replacement is basically impossible. It's still early in the game at this point, but I think already it's too far embedded to be replaced.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:04:29
Hey, sorry, I'm curious about what you're saying, are you a developer for one of the clients? Do you have any citations for what you're saying? The wiki makes it sound like scalability won't be an issue for a long time.
