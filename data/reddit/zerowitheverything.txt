Falling knives:All that 2017 FOMO lead to people getting burned, causing a backlash of sentiment. The correction was severe, and we're still bearish. But looking at the year chart, 6000 is a well tested bottom, volatility is down to a standstill, and we're about to break out of the year-long trend triangle in the next few weeks, one way or another.
Just my opinion, but I fully expect it to break-out. Lots of developments coming this November. New investment and implementation channels that should bring in big money.
DCA is a good strategy, and you should stick to it. The market could slip more. But now looks like a good time to invest to me. (I did put my money where my mouth is).

You're not late. You're right on time. The end of the bear, beginning of the bull.
@_date: 2018-10-21 08:46:55
I'm sure we'll see plenty of corrections along the way, which could prove profitable to a savvy day trader. 
But I expect bear traps in a bull market until we're somewhere past ATH. If large financial institutions really do get involved, they're going to buy then drive the price through the media, creating new levels of awareness and FOMO. 
Then they'll start selling and the bears will come. And the blood of the innocent will run red all over the market floor. But it still should be a much higher bottom than now.  
Hopefully as more people become aware, more will buy during bear season, making it shorter and give us more rational bulls.

They say "don't put all your eggs in one basket," but more things to have is more things to lose. Especially if they're in different hiding spots.  Really keeping track of the paper with your recovery code is the most vital thing, and you can always write multiple copies if you're worried about losing track of your holdings. Just make sure nobody ever finds them.
Multiple wallets does make a lot of sense if you're going to spend/trade with anyone in person. Its common sense to not walk around with big money in your pocket.

Higher highs (in the short term, not ath). 50 day MA crossing over 200 day MA.

Time to bust out the Ouija board.

It helps push adoption. That's all. :-/ And it does add unnecessary overhead to your payment process, so it's not terribly practical.
But if all of us did it, and adoption did increase, so would valuation/stability/security. 'Spend and replace' needs to be a social movement. Just you or I doing it is spitting in the ocean.

His retirement was a loss for the world. I don't know why they picked Trevor Noah to replace him, except that perhaps he was a lot more safe for the establishment.

Not your keys, not your crypto. While you might have had a good experience, may people seem to have lost crypto, and you never know when they might up and exit-scam everyone.   
Hosted wallet, ffs. You're putting your money in the hands of untrusted strangers.

In Jan of 2017, two years ago, bitcoin was valued at under $900. 4x in 2 years is not bad at all. $5k isn't little for those who have had skin in the game for a while.  
Still I believe 95% BTC will reach new all time highs, but not this year. We're still in the bear market, and even after it ends, things will go sideways for a while. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 18:39:07
Buy and replace.

Dude, I don't know what's wrong in your life, but it's certainly not me. Go redirect that pent up anger at someone else.

I've spent the last two years researching the technology and the industry developing around it.
I'm not in the least bit worried. IMO, 2.7% is not very smart. As I said, let's see how this plays out.
@_date: 2019-05-18 10:39:29
Because it's not on most history charts as it predates major exchanges.
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:19:27
Hah, sure, but that means far less if $1 loses all it's buying power. :)
Maybe we need a more stable metric. Like, how many cheeseburgers can we buy with 1btc.

Success in this space is just a matter of investment over time.

I did that like 20 minutes ago.
"spreading misinformation"
Dude,. that is someones hopium chart. It has nothing to do with reality.
And I'm one of the more bullish people here. I've been spreading pro-btc gospel all through the bear market.
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:22:45
Well..   maybe give it a rest when the price gets to 3-5x the previous ATH.
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:39:40
If you had stopped at the first sentence, I'd say, 'good point'. There's nothing clear about it, no way to count digits, but you can see the shift.
But after the second one, learn some fucking manners you child.
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:51:27
Needs more pixels. It's hard to tell how many digits there are, ~~but you can make out how many times it counts up from 1 to 9, which does seem to place it at $10m.~~
I don't believe we'll see $10m in 2023, but do think it's possible in time.
\*edit: You can see where it shifts from 5 to 6 digits, and it's not log scale, so yes, the peak is somewhere above 100k. I personally think we're going past 100k in 2021.
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:23:44
Put in the same amount of fiat at specific intervals so if the price dips, youll get more at lower prices. Its a good way of not trying to time the market and thus going 'all in' at the wrong time.
@_date: 2019-05-19 12:20:20
I didn't mock it. I'm not smug. Hell, I even admitted you're right, it's around 100k.
You're projecting big time.
Meanwhile, you're giving me shit for saying this is not clear, that I'm stupid for not being able to read this;

100% of my capital is in bitcoin. Lets see how this plays out.
@_date: 2018-12-23 07:39:15
It's exactly like that, except the car is your computer, the sudokus are crypto, and the heroin is still heroin.

Gen-Xers too. Hell, anyone who isn't rich.
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:27:08
it could start off slowly in 2019 and continue through 2020. It isnt likely to peak until 2021, at which point the bears will come back and everyone will start screaming crypto is dead again. 
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:21:42
Some people have many addresses, some addresses are for many people (exchanges, etc).  
It's far from perfect, but an impressive metric nonetheless.
@_date: 2019-05-20 07:24:31
If you buy the ATH, just buy the next low. Since that's passed, buy now.  
The opportunity is still here.
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:09:14
I'm a hodler too. This year is pure accumulation. I plan to keep at least half of my btc for well over 10 years.  
But I do plan on selling 1/3 of them somewhere north of 200k in anticipation of the next bear market.   
Yes, 99% of alts will go to zero before serving any real use case. But a few will find one and live on.  [��](
