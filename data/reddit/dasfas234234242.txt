I think the best way to do this would be to NAT all outbound traffic to a locally running bitcoind - although that might not be practical on an RPI due to resource constraints.. but perhaps once the SPV node stuff is available.

That's interesting.. but can be got around by using an offshore payment provider like bitpay. 
Actually though the more I think about this, the more I see potential for massive VAT fraud.. basically people in Germany can sell bitcoins to an offshore entity and then fraudulently claim back 19% of the value of the exported bitcoins from the government as a VAT export credit.

The merchants don't pay VAT for selling goods for bitcoin.. the people buying the BTC in the first place must pay it. The problem with that is that obviously they won't.. it makes it impossible to run something like coinbase in Germany (or rather you could run it, but nobody would use it since your prices would be 19% higher than those available offshore or on the black market). Germans will just buy BTC from offshore exchanges where they aren't charged VAT or trade with local traders p2p - possibly staying under VAT reporting thresholds. I suspect that this decision will be replicated in the UK and the VAT rules are quite similar.

Hmm well if that's true that really sucks.. the entire bitcoin tarding market will have to be illegal/underground in Germany as nobody is going to pay 19% for the priviledge of using bitcoins.

I guess someone can just run ssh on port 8333 and get free access :p
This kindof thing does seem like a good idea in general though.. I think what might be more useful for the home user is an open tor wifi hotspot though.. basically an open wifi where all requests are routed through tor.. sure it'll be slow, but at least you don't have to worry about what they're doing - and because it's slow, it won't take up much bandwidth :p

It's pretty easy to do using redsocks;
