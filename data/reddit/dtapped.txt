I've looked into this in the past (pre-bitcoin) and always concluded that the scrutiny that travelers would incur with this type of citizenship, would negate some of the sought benefits. Can you imagine being grilled going into the US or EU on one of these passports?

I was thinking more for a non US/EU/UK citizen who'd be using this to travel with. 
Edit to add: EU/UK

Not unless he's from India and there's a [price surge](

The zynga gaming demographic likely is very/totally unfamiliar with bitcoin. People immensely dislike change. More so as they get older. In order to make some conversions there will need to be incentive.

The way to support Zynga's bitcoin experiment is to make a small in game currency purchase. Many here don't play Zynga games, but if you check your facebook feeds (probably need to unblock their games temporarily) you'll likely find a relative who's an avid player. Perhaps someone a little older, maybe even your mother. 
Remember that you can't gift in game currency purchases to another account. So you'd need the person to sign in with their own account prior to purchasing for them.

If you're going to do it, the in game currency of Farm Cash is the way to do it. Coin purchases aren't worthwhile. 
Edit to add: you'd need to make the purchase using their actual account. You can't send in game currency from one user to another.

I've been pulled out of too many lines with a perfectly good Australian (no visa required for 90 days) passport for extra scrutiny. No background issues, nothing suspicious. 
Even though there *should be* no issues with St. Kitts-Nevis, I'd still be expecting them to look closely. Perhaps a more thorough background check.
Can we conclusively say that this type of Commonwealth citizenship wouldn't raise a flag?

That is not child's play either. He got away really light though. Makes me wonder why? Hmmmm..... probably talked a little when he was brought in.

Some of the reactions were pretty cringey. The girls didn't look all that interested. 
I applaud the effort, but the practical application requires a little tweaking.

This! I knew a guy who inherited 2million, day traded it up to 6m and then lost it ALL!!!
Stop chasing your losses. You don't have a clue what you're doing and you need to get a tourniquet on it before you've got nothing. I could go into in depth trading info, but you're not ready for it and would only misapply it. 
At this point you may as well go to the casino and put it all on black. Or y'know - keep what's left.

But Canadian officials have no record of anyone by the victim's name nor of any homicide occuring in that area at that time. Sounds like it was "clean".

Or it's one helluva a timing coincidence.

They'd be fully aware of what coinbase is. The banking industry has is watching the development of bitcoin very closely and they would have garnered advice from their legal department before sending out letters of this kind. 
As obscene as it is, they are likely acting within the terms of their account conditions. As we all know banks love to hit you with a thousand pages of terms and conditions for every possible situation just to make sure it's all in their favor and they've covered their ass. 
Whilst the terms and conditions would have nothing to do with bitcoin per se, there'd be something far more broad in relation to them having the ability to terminate an account for conducting business with an unapproved vendor (or words to that effect).

It's just a fuck up. They make take a month or two to sort it out though as banks move very slowly. Also you might not find out the origin of the mysterious debit.

Yeah they're going to pull out fast. It's too much risk for the average person to weather a storm that may be catastrophic.
