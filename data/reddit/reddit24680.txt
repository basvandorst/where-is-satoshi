My day trading days are over because I don’t have time to sit in front of the screen anymore like I used to...looking to hold long term now that I’m older...there is still room for this thing to fall

I’ve been day trading equities market for over 10 years and recently became interested in bitcoin.  I’ve been following it since February of this year but haven’t jumped in yet. Know why?  Looking at the charts on a daily basis, I can tell you that this is a heavily controlled and manipulated market.  I can see patterns where the manipulators are holding it at a certain price or range, and I can pretty much predict when they’ll pump and dump.  That’s why I haven’t jumped in yet.  Still biding my time...

Somebody please help me!  I had to reset my ledger nano s and got a new passphrase.  Now when I login in my neon wallet, my neo and gas tokens are gone- shows 0 balance!  I know this has nothing to do with bitcoin but this thread has a larger audience than neo.  What can I do to retrieve my neo and gas tokens?? Any help is much appreciated!
@_date: 2019-03-21 22:57:10
Hate to admit this but whales action is the only thing that makes this interesting anymore  ....otherwise just the same old boring sideways 
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:47:11
Much thanks for your help!  Your first sentence together with other op’s restore advice made me restore the ledger and use the old seed words.  I got the tokens back and can now breathe easier!!  You guys are the greatest for helping out a noob!  Much thanks!
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:57:19
Did that- I restored it and got all my tokens back!  Thanks for replying and yes I did panic!  Whew!  Hope other noobies can learn from this too!!  Thanks man!
@_date: 2019-03-08 23:25:06
Here comes boring sideways again &lt;sigh&gt;
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:36:59
Thanks!  The key word in your post was “restore”. I YouTubed the process and was able to retrieve the tokens!  Much thanks to you for reaching out to help a noob!  The process of seed words and addresses and keys have gotta get easier than this if we want adoption!!
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:04:40
When I reset the ledger, it gave me new seed words.  The problem is that the neon wallet is now showing a new public address (and not the old public address to which my neo and gas tokens were sent)

Sheeeet....now we know the whales’ playbook
@_date: 2019-02-01 21:43:00
Volume still low despite run up.  No one falls for these stupid pumps anymore you gdam whales and bots
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:55:56
Libra is having a tough get-go because it’s centralized so it makes sense that governments will oppose it.  As a result, bitcoin will
continue to rise!!

Forming choppy sideways top of Bart’s head now

The whales- they giveth and they taketh...
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:16:16
No one’s touching this anymore
The only thing that’s going on nowadays is exchanges and individual whales taking turns pumping and dumping to keep this thing alive.  They’re taking turns making money from hapless retail investors.

@_date: 2019-01-24 15:49:12
Van eck was trying to save face.  No way etf would be allowed due to manipulation by bots and whales up to this very DAY!!!  Until bitcoin market is regulated (yes I said it!), Cboe and Bakkt will be beat by bots!!!
@_date: 2019-01-22 05:27:39
It’s whalish
@_date: 2019-01-13 04:02:48
Yeah the whales are keeping bitcoin alive
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:34:04
Whales and exchange bots are trying to keep this thing alive by poking it with fake orders and pumps every time volume decreases.  Don’t let them fool you into thinking that there is ANY interest left in bitcoin.  After the ETF withdrawal news came out, I stated that Van Exk was trying to save face by blaming it on the shutdown.  He’s a smart business man and is it to make money.  He knew there was no more interest left in bitcoin so he bailed.  AND the manipulation is so rampant in this market that he gave up.
@_date: 2019-01-13 02:30:27
Notice how volume keeps decreasing...whales are propping the price up until they can do a dump
@_date: 2019-01-12 21:37:17
It’s sideways because there are no newcomers.  Whales pump and dump is the only significant action.  Otherwise, sideways......No new interest in bitcoin.  Only HOLDLERS here...
@_date: 2019-01-20 13:52:30
There are no bulls or bears in bitcoin market- only WHALES!
@_date: 2019-01-17 13:01:24
Wonder what the true price of bitcoin would be if all the trading bots were removed and whales propping up this artificial price 
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:59:13
Volume is low...be careful- whales are gonna make a move
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:44:41
bloody weekend
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:53:47
I know I know...why not just say 6600???  For some reason man, I’ll never forget that number.  Flip that 6 and it was like 911 and the price just fell off the cliff- that’s what it seemed like at the time!
@_date: 2019-05-09 01:28:40
Hahaha...good one!!
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:05:05
This is the way I see it: as much as we don’t want the feds involvement in the cryptocurrency market, it may be a bitter pill that we have to accept.  Sure, the regular stock market is regulated and there is still manipulation, but there are still protocols in place to control them....some are better than none at all.  This is why my mom and neighbors invest in the stock market.  Because there is some degree of protection and this makes them feel safe enough to put their hard earned money into the stock market..  Think about it, if bitcoin is to replace fiat, it HAS to be accepted by the common masses.  People will NOT throw their hard earned money into a device that is unstable and unregulated because of manipulation by the wealthy whales and because of scams in an unregulated market.  Simply, why would my mom and neighbors adopt when there is no protection for them?  For this reason, people have not accepted bitcoin.  Maybe once the feds regulate it in some fashion, people can stomach the idea of using it as currency....then adoption will come next.  Don’t forget, it’s a digital currency that the lay person doesn’t even have a grasp on how to use it, yet.  Personally, I think that digital currency WILL replace fiat!  But to get to that stage sooner rather than later, I think that we have to accept the feds involvement to some degree (to what degree is up for debate).  Everything has become digital nowadays.  Young and middle aged people have witnessed the changes and advances that have taken place over the years.  Digitalizing money is next and it is inevitable!

Wanna de-weed the cryptospace?  Start by removing the turkey tether from the exchanges!  Everyday that I see this turkey listed in charts is an ugly reminder that it’s the weakest link, an albatross, a laughingstock in the market that mocks us by getting the last laugh because it’s in bed with the exchanges...

CNBC or Bloomberg kept me informed when I was trading stocks for years.  I knew well enough when they were pushing some stock for their own agenda or bs-ing the public.  It’d be nice if there was a special segment on tv dedicated to crypto news instead of reading about it all the time.
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:46:34
Ok- i was mistaken.  Thanks for the heads up!
