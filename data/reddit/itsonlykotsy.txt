will that be it's own coin or will it be an update to bitcoin?

Quadriga just enabled e-mail transfers. I sent some funds in earlier today and they had processed it within 5-6 hours. I was really impressed because I've been using their EFT up till this point and that takes 4-5 business days.

I was disappointed to because my bank normally has the security question but they must've gotten rid of it in the last week or so. I'm not sure what bank you're with but maybe double check and then maybe check every now and again down the road. My bank wasn't even listed in the examples Quadriga gives in the description.

Awesome, mine is en route!
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:26:19
I'm having that issue too.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:54:42
I think it's about 4 business days for verification.

I think that's good news. The fact that we're invested when most people think like that is a good thing. When they're eventually educated we'll start to see insane gains.

Well if you remember they did an episode on a stock tip and Kramer was the only one that came away laughing in the end.

I recently did a BTC tx with 10sat/byte. It's been a 30 hour wait so far. Luckily it's a really small amount so I'm ok if it never goes through.

Open your eyes

trying opening up a support ticket. I think that helps speed things along.

The question is - is the dip over or will it go deeper in the coming week?
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:15:35
I've been waiting for a dip before my initial buy in. It's stressing me out.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:20:31
I think it's still relevant. The cheaper you buy it, the more profit you will have later. You're obviously making money either way, but $250 is going to get you a bigger fraction of a coin when the rate is lower.

Ended up getting lucky and jumped on the small dip tonight!
