First, i dont need a lesson in ponzy. Second, im not trading "altcoins", i´m investing in "blockchains". Not looking for "getting rich" fast. 
Third, have a look into e.g. factom: it has a real world use cases, community, partners... hell, they actually using this blockchain for a specific purpose. I´m just suggesting you try to be a little bit open-minded (and remain skeptic in a healthy manner!) and be less a bitcoin maximalist.

nice one :D

Dont underestimate politics and society and don't overestimate bitcoin... I'm a bitcoin believer, but if you buy bitcoin at its current state,  you exchange money which is controlled by some people against money which is controlled by even less people...

You clearly underestimate Germanys economical power

don't use coinbase. i mean AT ALL
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:42:30
i disagree. if you only use very few funds, which you can afford to lose, it's quite exciting to play around on the main chain. In fact i use this opportunity to run a full node by my own now.
(on average a channel is being funded at ~4BTC/~800Channels = 0,005btc = 50 Bucks)
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:25:44
at the current state it doesnt matter who accepts bitcoin. nobody would pay these fees for everyday expenses. neither in bitcoin and now also ethereum it seems.
But i'm excited mid term about new scaling techniques like lighting or sharding.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:01:26
Very good analogy, thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:43:21
well i've read at least 3 warnings on the way to create a lightning node (right now only a test node).
nobody can't complain about that tbh. it's very transparent that this is in an alpha stage. but it's quite cool to look at this and think or show someone "this node in the right corner there is my node" 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:23:40
the BCC collapse is in contrary very good news.

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:47:33
Really? Segwit? You really think that's the solution?  At this point it doesn't matter anymore if you use Segwit or not.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:52:45
Minus 5 bucks transacting free into your wallet XD
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:16:37
I think the recent peak times were the times of big market moves. Because most transactions are still between exchanges. Thus batching can actually help during peaks
@_date: 2017-02-11 09:38:58
I have always some Fiat in position to buy after a flash crash. That's the strategy. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:52:30
everybody knew bitcoin will tank if ETF was declined. so there were many speculating that the price would go down further. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:23:25
The EU was declared as many times dead as bitcoin.  Brexit will cost brits a freaking lot... 
@_date: 2017-01-01 08:58:22
You are forgetting, that now there are a lot of alts and that it needs a freaking amount of fiat to bring bitcoin to a 5 digit level. 
I'm a bit more sceptic, because segwit vs.  BU situation will probably stall bitcoin development and usage. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:59:30
I never understood why they don't have at least a small fee... Can anyone elaborate on this? 
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:56:14
Not in crypto, wait until it raise or plummets 10 to 30 percent in one day.. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:32:41
Well half the market *seems* to be in China. What do you expect? 
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:22:59
well paper wallets are nice and easy for only storing. but if you want to do transaction it's quite cumbersome. 
with a hardware wallet, you're able to do transfers and the transaction signing takes place on the device itself. your private key is never exposed to your PC or the internet.
so you can even use the wallet on a malicious computer and would be safe. your hardware wallet is also guarded by a PIN, if you may lost it or it gets stolen. with a backup 25 word seed you can recreate you keys on a new device.
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:12:35
yes it does. there is a currency war going on and USD is pretty strong against most currencies afaik
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:50:38
Sure they compete. Can't put 100 usd in crypto and gold at the same time, if you have only 100 usd to send...
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:07:55
well about 12% of fiat are in alts and not bitcoin. and before the bull run (and probably after it) we'll see bitcoin at a market share of &lt; 80% again...
@_date: 2017-01-13 21:39:36
33% drop in 2 weeks is pretty bubble-ish imo
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:49:13
Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:48:32
I'll be pretty bearish, because i don't see any of the events happen, although i wishful thinking it. Enough miners are opposed to segwit and the Etf is a running joke. Did you read the latest report? 
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:24:55
the SEC is addressing a lot of question/concerns like "is it a ponzi" or "high volatility" etc. everything we all heard before.
for me it reads, that they don't get bitcoin. could be good, but probably bad.
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:43:48
you know, buy and sell is relative. basically you change one currency for another. if you change for fiat, you're changing into a weak currency. over time you will buy less with USD or EUR or whatever. 
as i mentioned: you don't get bitcoin or crypto at all. you just trade it to make fiat "profits". 
@_date: 2017-01-13 21:19:41
Leveraged trading is based on debt - like the fiat system. also it doesn't help volatility and makes things worse, scares of new people. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 18:30:16
in germany we use bitcoin.de which support express buy/sell as long as your bank balance is positive ;-)
it works, because the web site has a partnership with a "web 2.0 bank" call fidor (a pure online bank). if you have an account there and the buyer/seller has also an account there, money get transfered instantanously.
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:49:08
That's irony...is it? Just asking to be sure :)
@_date: 2016-11-11 12:26:13
Still price is stagnating... 
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:09:19
Hush, No altcoin discussions here.
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:19:54
good, stick to your fiat "profit". i stick to my crypto profits.
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:34:23
Neither segwit nor BU will activate this year
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:19:56
you create a 24 word seed during the initialization, which is you backup key. this has to be stored somewhere safely in case of lost or theft. furthermore you create a 4 letter PIN, which you have to enter everytime you stick in the wallet into you PC. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:16:13
Btw. Bitcoin hit already ATH for some currencies, like EUR some days or weeks ago
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:16:27
EUR is simply losing against USD
@_date: 2016-12-25 12:33:27
better buy and not to be sorry later, because you waited for another opportunity
@_date: 2016-11-14 22:24:50
It's not a good news for anyone. Even bitcoin holders
@_date: 2016-12-21 19:18:29
Sure it can be regulated for businesses, like exchanges. Or commerce. Nothing will stop private persons to share bitcoins, but imagine if US or China regulated bitcoin in commerce. Price would drop like a hot potato
@_date: 2016-11-14 22:19:52

sorry but this guy is a fraud, poser and bad actor. He is also a prisoner on his own property. It's a matter of time when he goes to jail. The worst part is, that after years he believes his own made up life story and image.

@_date: 2016-12-25 12:25:56
Thanks. I'll try it out! 
@_date: 2016-11-30 18:06:50
All the recent ethereum based projects and ICOs kickibg off are proof enough imho, that there are many ethereum devs... And despite all the drama there, the eth foundation proved, that they react fast to all exploits and issues so far. 
If bitcoiners disrespect that, they underestimate ethereum like banksters underestimate bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 07:44:06
that reminds me of that:

The altcoin argument reminds me of regimes calling people with different opinions terrorists. And it's a no brainer to ban terrorists,  is it? Frankly, I'm disappointed of bitcoin communities as a whole.

@_date: 2016-12-18 01:04:41
I agree. But due to the bad (or almost non existent) governance model of bitcoin, nothing significant will happen.
The root problem is not segwit vs. big blocks. So i guess another coin will be used for everyday transactions. But I'm not allowed to mention it here :p
@_date: 2016-11-16 18:27:44
Sure 100% segwit related! Because there's absolutely no doubt that it will activate! 
@_date: 2016-12-27 22:02:09
well according to the web site, it works with the nano, but not nano S: 
@_date: 2016-12-12 07:08:05
That's because they don't care about confirmation or take the risk of double spending afaik

@_date: 2016-09-25 19:24:00
i'm not trading... also bitcoin is mainly used for speculation. i don't know any person who actually spend bitcoin. 
all i wanna say is: be aware that coindesk is very biased. e.g. during the spectacular monero rise (10 fold!), coindesk wasn't mention anything. and it was all over the news (darknet markets etc.)
there are many cool projects and facinating tokens out there. and also a lot of crap. just do your research and don't believe the FUD
@_date: 2016-09-20 19:18:30
Live in Germany, don't know it. But I'm not a professional investor though. I see a lot of post like this recently,  e.g. the "big" German energy company accepting bitcoin. In fact it's a regional company almost nobody know of except people from hannover... 
@_date: 2016-09-25 19:34:13
and i bet you don't even know me. i didn't say the article is shit. all i wanna say is, that coindesk articles should be carefully questioned as much as any ICOs and other crypto tokens.

Maybe he was also the leader in disguise...
@_date: 2016-09-04 15:16:43
so your advice is to spend it on DNM? because thats one of the few place where you can actually spend bitcoin. maybe i´m impatient, but i dont see bitcoin anytime soon adopted mainstream (or even close to). and i dont want to start with transaction fees....
For me, bitcoin is digital gold and investment vehicle to participate in ICOs and trade into blockchain tech. For this, bitcoin actually works very good and serves as a backbone of the crypto space.

Coindesk is known to be biased about bitcoin. If you really think that the so called altcoins are useless and fake and do not provide some value, then you're not better than bankers denying the value of bitcoin. 
Personally I'm hedging bitcoin risks with other blockchain assets. Because that's the smart thing Todo if you leave emotions and church like believing out of it. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 06:15:39

I don't know if these kind of "restrictions" will ever help bitcoin to gain mainstream adoption... 
@_date: 2016-10-07 11:07:16
Maybe it's a self fulfilling prophecy
@_date: 2016-10-21 17:13:31
Entwrprise blockchain sounds weird.. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 09:26:54
Pun intended? :)

It's national holiday here in Germany
@_date: 2016-10-27 18:06:36
don't want to troll around. i'm just a dissapointed bitcoin user...or ex-user
@_date: 2016-10-06 15:49:06
Thanks, the first time i saw an easy to understand explanation of segwit
@_date: 2016-10-22 20:34:32
Btw it's always China. Bitcoin has basically become Chinacoin. They have a big miner meeting and are discussing to switch to unlimited. Need more popcorn... 
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:45:54
Finally some reasonable voice here. This "us vs. Them" topic is pretty useless.

The more coins an exchange is gonna support, the more they generate income. Why wouldn't any major support a second chain, if there is a market for it?
@_date: 2016-10-17 15:30:04
in the end, it doesn't matter. just another reason to buy bitcoin....
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:54:33
posts/threads like this activate my sell trigger finger tbh...
@_date: 2016-10-04 18:56:38
the interview is all about the technology behind bitcoin. so basically all cryptos. wouldn't get too exitet here. but it's a good thing blockchains get more traction every week
@_date: 2016-10-11 05:37:50
agree, but i think ViaBTC has a good timing here. 
@_date: 2016-10-08 16:15:49
I use it too. Very simple and fast. Not recommended for trading, just buy and sell. 
@_date: 2016-10-05 18:09:08
No,  it was under 2 usd before it got back a little bit after this announcement.

I think he means the influence on the price is mainly driven by China
@_date: 2016-10-27 16:31:47
Wow swiss. How much people live in Switzerland? How much in china, the home country of bitcoin nowadays...? Furthermore, bitcoin is a store of value than a payment system, isn't it? I keep hearing this a lot lately. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:01:01
If Bitcoin is a p2p cash system, why can't I buy groceries with it? Most famous transaction was about buying a pizza. Now you tell me bitcoin was not meant for these use cases...
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:32:02
he means soft forks. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:31:55
you people are way too optimistic. 80% signaling doesnt necessary mean 80% will actually switch to segwit. Lets assume only 60% are switching to segwit, thus not acceptin non-segwit blocks:
if non-segwit miners accept segwit-block but segwit-miners don't accept non-segwit blocks, there could be a big mess and it could even end into the longest chain being non-segwit chain (although more support for segwit). 
also a lot of reorganisations of not accepted block transactions... Thats the reason why the 95% support was there in the first place.

As a user I don't want to calculate any fees. My wallet should do this. 
Furthermore it doesn't matter what is running on the blockchain. It should run. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:45:15
some valid points there in the article. but what makes bitcoin different than others for me is this: 
**Is nobody worried about that?**
All the talk about secure network is one-sided: it's pretty unsecure if you can't rely on your transaction going through in matter of minutes.
EDIT: formatting
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:47:45
I'm interested in more bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:43:58
Can we please stop the 21 million argument. It's 21,000,000,000,000,00 satoshis
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:46:45
Simple question for everyone: would you buy bitcoin at the current state? My personal answer is NO. There is no FUD, just uncertainty. Been selling for weeks and so far it was a good decision.
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:49:50
we're getting there. first signs of panic in the market. i have my fiat ready....yummi
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:26:15
i agree. it's actually the best thing which could happen. Let the market decide. It will free up a lot of pressure bitcoin has been for years.
@_date: 2017-06-11 07:39:05
Imho the chances your wallet/phone gets stolen or lost is bigger than having a malicious app accessing your private wallet keys, where you should not have more than in an actual wallet.

What the hell are you talking about... Watched to much Trump speeches?

Good that you can choose between dozens of religions....Or none.

Please research more about the resilience of the internet and therefore bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:57:10
So if I would know your private key, that would me make the "owner" of the bitcoins. This is plain stupid. Technically, nobody owns any bitcoin. They just know a secret to move them to other addresses.
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:32:41
They are still looking for someone who can "build the system". So currently it's just an idea.
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:08:36
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:10:52
They will have a hard time to prove that I know something

You can come to Germany. This week gay marriage will be legalized probably. Or to be precise, it will have the same status as a hetero marriage.
