Relative to it's lifetime it's been pretty steady. Not all of us are just here for the month...

BTC isn't a company - there's no tangible expectation of ROI so there's really nothing to destroy yet. As of now it's not even a currency. This is the wild fucking west.

If it's just floating on the exchange than anyone who finds a way to grab it will. This is all just data and there's no such thing as data that can't be hacked. Make it harder for them by stashing it in a more secure place.

In seven years you'll hate yourself for not buying at $10k.

Right here. I'll have no problem taking a bit of profit here and there but the ultimate goal isn't to *sell* BTC, it's to *spend* BTC. If it takes 20 years, I'm fine so long as we get there.

But all that will happen after the damage is done or preemptively to prevent it, i.e.: we saw a tangible set of circumstances and acted.  BTC *does* have 0 fundamental valuation - it's worth something theoretically because I'll agree to sell my goods/services to someone who's willing to pay with it. Even though plenty of businesses accept BTC we're really not to that point yet because as a currency there's no stable value - nobody wants to pay $50 million for a pizza. Until we're closer to the 21 million and the fucking day traders back off it's nothing more than a war of ideals. BTC could be worth absolute zero tomorrow morning after trading for $2 million at midnight - nobody knows.

HODLing... Will continue to do so. See you guys in a few years...

I got in at just under $1000 after kicking myself for not doing it at $4 and finally taking the time to fully understand what it is. I like the idea. I want it to succeed.

We already did that. And here we are...

If not sooner...

True but spending a tiny bit here and there will help it on it's way to actually becoming a currency. Give $10 to charity or grab something at a bookstore every now and then. Not enough to eat away at it but just enough to let retailers know they're not wasting their time.

The Euro is a recognized currency that falls under established exchange rates. BTC right now has no real legal definition regardless of what people think it is (and all sorts of people are thinking different things). Not paying taxes isn't quite the revolution that's going on here. By all means, fight your fight though.
