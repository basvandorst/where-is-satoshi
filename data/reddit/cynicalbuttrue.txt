assuming governments get them first, bitcoin will be their first target, not their partners at goldman sachs.

and no fiat is 'real'.  gold and bitcoin are more 'real' already.

Smart investors buy the rumor and sell the news.  Said another way, once media are talking about something it's too late to get the big win.  Once main stream media are talking about it its about to top out.  And this is harsh, but here it is, once unsophisticated kids on reddit are talking about it, its going to tank.  
When "dumb money" is in a buying frenzy, you sell.  Its like a poker game, its about knowing the people who are making trades, not about charts and news.

have you ever heard of "last word narcissism"?  its the compelling desire to continue drama and conflict beyond the point at which everyone else is happy to walk away with an unflinching need to have the last word.
