I bought 0.037  and will plan to buy another 0.040 or so if it gets near 9000 again. Into cold storage with the rest and then wait until it goes up again.

I buy things with BTC. I spent 250 CAD worth last week, cost me 2.00 in transaction fees, but when I bought in, it cost me 100 CAD.
Everyone so far that has ever bet against bitcoin has been wrong.  Sucks for you to be on the wrong side.

Technically my mom is in the club now. I was telling my bro how I made good money in like 4 months, and my mom overheard, promptly grabbed her check book and said, “I heard about this bitcoin stuff, have you made any money? Go buy me some” *hands me cheque for 1000*
Now her and my step dad are checking gdax hourly LOL

You sound like a sad man that missed his chance. It's ok, just buy the next dip or be butthurt and sad forever.

Coinbase sucks donkey dick, they just make it easy (when convenient for them) for people to buy cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:00:54
Hours for me, maybe days. Only time I’m not glued to it is when I’m driving lol.

For me to lose any money. Literally the entire cryptomarket would have to crash. At this point there's too many people invested that believe in the technology for it to fail that hard and fast. Just dont try and bet me your left ball. Didn't work out too well for the last guy.

I spend btc once a month (about 250 cad) and replace it immediately. This is the best way I feel I can contribute to and still maintain my investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:22:38
Brace yourselves, here comes 17k...
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:03:05
FUUUUUCK yes.

I got mine out Jan 15 from QCX, whew dodged a bullet there
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:47:34
I just opened an RBC account yesterday so I can transfer to QCX. Had the same issue last week so you gotta find a way around it. Interac online seems the way to go. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:47:55
I have some on exchanges so I can learn/fail to day trade, and or sell a bit to lock in a bit of profit. The majority of what I have is in cold storage so my dumbass can't panic sell. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:45:59
1400 here, and have another 600 ready to go..
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:50:06
Not every credit union offers the preferred funding methods. I bank with a credit union but just opened an RBC account because they have interac online and non co-branded debit cards. BMO banned crypto purchases on my credit card.

TIME TO BUY!
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:59:45
Canadians cant sell on coinbase. You need to sign up for QuadrigaCX for example to sell your BTC for CAD. Once you have an account or a wallet, transfer your BTC to GDAX from coinbase and then transfer to your wallet/quadriga address with no fees. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:34:08
I bought something for about 250cad using bitcoin, but replaced it by buying 2000 worth of BTC. OOPS :P

My friend ;), orders cannabis online and pays with BTC, it's delivered through Canada Post. Comes from Vancouver and the company has been operating for years. Create a profile with your Driver's License and that's it!

As a winnipegger, great to see more of these around so people can get exposed to them! I might just hang out at shell when I’m washing my car to answer questions lol
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:13:06
Where is this? I'm in winnipeg? Do they accept BTC as payment? I'll visit if so!
Edit: also.. Go JETS Go!

I e transferred 2k to QCX from RBC and it took less than a day.  
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:36:31
Dumb idea
