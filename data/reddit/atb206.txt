Bitcoin has by far the best chance to succeed and is already somewhat risky. My recommendation if you are going to diversify is to match your market share of bitcoin with the alts and not some arbitrary percentage. That way your upside is somewhat similar but you have the most probable coin (by far) in bitcoin.
For example, if you have 10 btc and there are 21m, purchase 40 litecoin since there are 84m and if it somehow surpasses bitcoin you are covered. You would be investing 110k vs 7.2k but have the same potential. I hedge my bet on bitcoin this way. FYI I diversify into a few alts: Neo, Litecoin, Ether, and a few random ones.

I’m confused why this isn’t upvoted more.

Why isn't there a newcomers guide stickied at the top of r/bitcoin? Videos, FAQs, guides for buying and storing bitcoin etc.

Historically, I have always liked Coinbase and thought they have gotten an unfair treatment from the libertarian bitcoin community for adhering to government regulations and being overly cautious in that regard. They are a business involved in money transmission and it makes sense to me how they have acted. Bitcoin wouldn't be what it is today without Coinbase being easy to use by the average buyer. 
Recently I feel like they are more involved in bitcoin politics than they should be. I would hope that they would be as impartial as they can and let the community argue back and forth. Not supporting segwit and not giving people their bcash for so long while stating they would immediately support segwit2x seems sketchy.

Love it. Great for adoption. I suggest adding flash sales (~30-60 mins) with limited quantities. This will encourage people new to bitcoin to maintain a balance of btc with hopes of finding a great deal on an item they desire.

Bitcoin is not private. Bitcoin's strength is its scarcity and that fact that no government, company, or person can choose to weaken it's value by arbitrarily creating more of it.

While I do not have any faith in Bitcoin Cash, pretty disappointed in coinbase for not giving its users the ability to hold it. 
I think it will be valued FAR less than BTC but they have enough supporters that the price will make the coin worth having even just to sell right away. 
Also, it seems like coinbase is doing them somewhat of a favor by taking so much supply off the market. Many people would sell Bitcoin cash immediately and drive the price down even quicker.
