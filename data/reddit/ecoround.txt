You're right, but the article made it seem like altcoins are struggling(down in value) while bitcoin is the only one that doing good. I would rather have a diverse portfolio of 50/50 bitcoin and altcoin instead of putting all my eggs in one basket

If you look at it like that, youre right.

My portfolio of small cryptos is up 150% over the last 3 months. Dont know what this article is talking about

Yep it is

Electrum. Desktop and mobile are both really good with a lot of functionality. The UI is pretty basic tho

Most miners are in China so propagation is not too bad. Pretty normal

Keep in mind that blocks are relayed over multiple hops. Even with todays fast connections all around the world about 1% of nodes get the new blocks only 1 minute later. Thats an effective reduction of revenue from mining by 10%. In a very competitive industry like mining thats a big issue, because its a slippery slope and benefits the big centralised mining farms

The wikimedia foundation is accepting bitcoin for months now. Just google for: "wikipedia donate"

Yep, I use 15 satoshi and it's typically pretty quick. Sometimes it can take a couple hours tho

9.8 sat/b is pretty low. I wouldnt worry until 24 hours passed.

A diverse portfolio is generally a good idea. I for example have 50% in BTC and 50% in other crypto

Have you downloaded the full blockchain yet? The blockchain is about 160 GB at the moment.

F2pool and Slushpool already confirmed they will not be running 2x - thats about 17% hashrate secured at the very very least

bitcoin.de ist super. Hatte dort bisher keine probleme

Most people don't get exponential growth. Bitcoin is still in its very very early stages. I totally agree with your assessment. 11 years seems about right
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:26:43
Relax, it's going it be fine. If you can't wait, the easiest thing to do would be: Create a new wallet and then sweep the old wallet with a big transaction fee.

The NSA probably cant crack it (yet?). The weakest link would probably be a keylogger or trojan etc.

The "bitcoin miner" ruins it a bit because its all asics nowadays. Something like "crypto miner" would fit better in my opinion

Yep 9.8 sat/b should clear in a day or two. I regularly send with 15 sat/b and it never takes more than a couple hours typically
