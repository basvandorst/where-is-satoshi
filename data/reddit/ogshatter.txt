A) People do things besides stare at reddit all day; like work. Give them time to research and react. Instant it most definitely should not be.
B) Many people have FIAT sitting in exchanges.
C) Wallet Size/Exchange Volume has NOTHING to do with calculating price; price being the ultimate measure of value. Think back to when GOXcoins dropped from their premium price tag to sub $150... Wallet Size didn't change; supply and demand as affected by liquidity is what changed.

The moment the author states that "Banks like to inject fresh cash" the article is over. The ONLY reason they do that is to affect interest rates.. Since coins from a block chain are created in a predictable manner; the entire reasoning of this article is flawed.

I definitely see the value added in using the gold card for long-term storage, but I think you'll start to see that the reason that consumers prefer off-line storage is so that larger amounts of coins can be held in a PERSONALLY SECURED manner. I know there will be many consumers who will be using the gold card the way that you intended it to be used, but I will probably be using it the way I described so that I can make use of The gold card security features when my Address is being used publicly in on a regular basis... I actually see the features of the gold card as paralleled to the credit card security features offered by companies like MasterCard and American Express! My .02 on marketing the awesome product you guys offer!
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:22:44
If I order the silver card now, is there any inherent reason to continue using it when the gold card releases? If not, maybe offer a trade in? Speaking of, is there any info about the pricing of the gold cards? Thanks again, fantastic answers so far!

I appreciate your response beyond words. I def get it now... In your opinion what is the most secure way to hold your coin? I was thinking verso wallet /w card for petty cash spending and BitGo for majority storage; now I'm rethinking that a bit.

@_date: 2014-04-05 00:50:14
But that context is irrelevant seeing as this network is distributed and you are comparing it to networks that are centralized.... It just so happens that services built ontop of the blockchain end up being centralized in terms of "trust" as well.

ps. also Robocoin charges the large transaction fee but doesn't even pay the high priority mining fee of like 10 cents...
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:22:44
They do here in south Florida...
@_date: 2014-04-05 00:22:53
But when the reward is split amongst a pool how can you even use that average in any sort of context? Lol no actual miner gets ~$30 per transaction; where as every actual Robocoin ATM does actually get a fee close to that.

just from personal experience I haven't seen low priority take longer than 3hrs or so for me, thought obviously I know it can take longer.... as a consumer grade atm this should have been much more thoroughly thought out before rushed to market to compete with other, easier to use, btc atms.

Verso Wallet is for iOS.. I love it. Tied to a credit card style "paper wallet"

Do you suggest using our name for the card name? Is it printed on the front?

Many people on that list have come out in other threads stating they have never had a Coinbase account. Try not to propagate rumors; especially on April 1st.
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:41:04
Seeing as some of the personal emails must be used on other websites as well, it is interesting to see that there are no phishing attempts from say Blockchain.info, which also has a request payment option.  I can easily see this as a CB PR attack.
@_date: 2014-04-05 00:13:27
How do you get that average of $30/transaction? I think there are quite a few miners that would disagree? 
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:16:51

Anyone who is dumb enough to need to define "number of transactions" should just sell off their BTC now. How redundant can you be holy shit...

Read the IRS report, if you sell within a year you owe ordinary income tax ~24%, if you sell in over a year you owe capital gains tax ~15%

@_date: 2014-03-27 23:39:58
You've obviously never filled out a tax return correctly or ever.

You can do the very same thing on facebook? look people up by full name and email... What confuses me is all the people getting the coinbase spam but never had a coinbase account... maybe youre trying to hide the truth about a btctalk or inputs.io leak... hmmmmmmm

Wtf are you babbling about. I've heard crackheads make more sense than you.
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:01:27
Yea, plus individual miners typically don't realize full block rewards.. where as Visa realizes "every block reward" aka transactions fees.... yea equating transaction fees to block rewards does not make sense.
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:36:29
Agreed. Features that are spammable in general should have the option of being turned off!

He is more right than you ... Two lines move to create price; supply and demand.. If china didn't make that announcement (amongst a few other happenings) the highest price could have been much higher than 1100+ and then pulled back to something still over 1k... Perceived demand typically drives actual demand.
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:04:39
It's possible the leaks were from inputs.io or btctalk and someone referenced the email list against the Coinbase bug.....
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:26:57

Any extra tips for using the wallet in it's current implementation?
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:54:35
You're forgetting about the volatility in gold price.. You know what , let's add a few more dependant variables in there for good measure. 
If you don't own bitcoin then you would never be opting to purchase in it anyways; just like if you have USD and your favorite bullion dealer is offering a 3% discount for paying in GBP... You're still not going to transfer out of your currency of choice..
@_date: 2014-03-22 20:36:23

@_date: 2014-02-16 19:41:46
Thank you for clearing that up! Would it make sense to use a silver card as a permanent storage device while using the gold card for public transactions seeing as it is "backed" by verso?
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:00:05
They are obviously trying to make sure you're not laundering money.....

How much you pay back depends on the form of bankruptcy now doesn't it?

@_date: 2014-04-09 23:05:54
Buck, Bill, scratch, paper..... You don't need a term that is exclusive to one context in order for it to not be confused when used within another context... That's why when someone is paying me and I say that will be 2 bucks, they don't get confused or exclaim that they are not a hunter.
All the points you're making are valid, but necessarily important.
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:28:06
Tl;dr Robocoin took his BTC back and didn't confirm within 24hrs so he couldn't redeem his ~$600 before needing to fly out of Austin.

But people aren't supposed to have emotional attachment to (give a shot about) currency... When's the last time you saw someone not spend greenbacks because they love the fed (issuing entity)?

Bankrupt doesn't mean no money and it certainly doesn't mean no BTC... It means you cannot pay your debts IN ENTIRETY, so after declaring bankruptcy your debt is reset (albeit you'll never get a good loan again). Maybe you're do for a finance class sir.
