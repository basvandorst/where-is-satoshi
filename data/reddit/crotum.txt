Yes they do, but considering the money put into coinbase is already taxed, only the profits made from bitcoins on coinbase would be taxable once sold from coinbase wallet considering it hasn't been in an actual bank account because that's money coinbase currently owns you haven't owned any of that money for you to be taxed on until it's out of their account and into your hands to be taxed?

All you did was tell a story with no real information as to why it reminds you of bitcoin. Okay.

That's what can be claimed by putting already taxed income(your USD) into a bank(coinbase), exchanging your USD to a wallet for bitcoin is only a currency exchange, taxable income then would only be the profits made off those exchanges, right? The USD in a bank account is already taxed, why would simply moving your already taxed money from one bank to another, exchanging it for another currency, be taxed again?

If that's what happens, where's your proof?

If 'banks' like coinbase actually hold the copies to the keys of your bitcoins when buying and selling from them and they hold money in their fiat wallet, does buying and selling from them mean that taxable money actually never touches your hands to be taxed on until it hits your real bank account?

What do you recommend using for buying and storing?

What is the wall?

So do you use bitstamp or gemini for a wallet and buy from there too?

Personal responsibility.
