Look at Syscoin ($SYS).  Still not a bitcoin project, but it is a better decentralized market with good roadmap.

I started with bitcoin.tax and had to switch to CoinTracking.info.  Took a bit to figure out CT, but I finally got everything to balance.  A few tips:
1.  You need all buys, sells, deposits, and withdrawals from every exchange account and wallet to balance.  Shapeshift exchanges are never accounted for correctly.  
2.  Check for duplicate transactions.  CT has a tool for that, but if amounts and date/time don’t match, it won’t see them as duplicate, so it’s limited.
3.  If you are off by small amount, it’s probably due to missing fees, or if REALLY small, then could be a rounding error.  Just add a misc. adjustment spend-type transaction manually to balance, and be done with it.

Definitely Authy.  With Google Authenticator, you lose your phone, you lose your 2FA keys.

You might have a hard time claiming the lower long-term capital gains rate, but if you pay short-term rate when you sell, you will still be compliant and the govt won’t argue with you.

I’m using LIFO.  The one thing that I find is annoying with CT is that you can’t select method by coin.  
Cost basis doesn’t change for deposits, only buys.  So, in your scenario, Exchange Y doesn’t know the basis if you never bought them on Exchange Y.  If you have both exchange X and Y in CT, CT will figure it out by matching up buys and sells, but that’s why I said you need to have all exchanges and wallets in CT.  Otherwise, things don’t balance and you have to manually input.
