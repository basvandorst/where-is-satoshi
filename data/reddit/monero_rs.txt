A high net worth individual with a mortgage.. LOL.

Its coming motherfuckers...

ERC20 token on Ethereum blockchain. Can't wait for the flippening.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:43:19
wow, bitcoin sure is a shitshow at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:06:19
So you bought all these shitcoins but not Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:02:58
Monero, Ethereum, take your pick...
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:32:09
LOL, can't wait for silent majority to wake up and boot batshit crazy core devs once and for all.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:21:56
Bitcoin Core is Blockstream. Over and out.

How safe are hardware wallets when this one guy, Saleem Rashid, managed to hack both Ledger and Trezor... Oh and he is only 16.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:12:54
True. Hedge accordingly with Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:27:19
My entire net worth is in crypto. No bank account, not even an account on a crypto-fiat exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:36:19
I disagree. Segwit2x must happen if bitcoin is to survive.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:53:03
Mozart has been playing piano since he was 5, this Saleem kid has been playing with both Ledger and Trezor for less than a few months. Something is seriously wrong in the hardware wallet industry, it's like they are feeding us dog shit...
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:44:49
Lets wait and see. Blockstream is done.

Oh let me tell  you about my economic background... I'm a software developer, I've had several visa/master merchant accounts closed for petty reasons. In 2013 Visa decided to close our account (3% chargeback rate), cancel all recurring subscriptions (120k/month) and hold over 500k (everything we had on account) for 180 days. Overnight I went from a millionaire to a broke person. Few weeks later I discovered bitcoin. 
If it wasn't for this I very much doubt I would have discovered btc in 2013...
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:24:15
LOL, core minions are desperate.
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:55:17
Interesting... I will contact them to see what they can do.
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:46:17
How dare you promote Ethereum here!
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:04:11
how dare you! ban this troll!
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:21:43
The teams work together. Imagine that...
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:05:29
It is going to look like a black diamond skiing slope very very soon.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:01:31
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:54:51
Funny, that's exactly what Blockstream is doing!
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:21:14
I hold both Xapo and BitPay debit cards. 3k eur daily withdrawal limit. I've been living 100% off bitcoin since 2014.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:45:11
All wrong answers here. First you buy the fucking hw wallet then bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:59:37
LOL :) This place has turned into a crack house.
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:45:33
Yes it is. Bitcoin requires a certain set of skills to understand - took me a full year and I have a background of 20 years of unix system administration, programming, etc. I ran a BBS years before internet went mainstream (1990). With the tools we have today (not much has changed since 2013 when I went full bitcoin mode) I'd say it would take an average person 2-5 years to really understand how bitcoin works and use all of its features. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:50:57
There are no other card issuers otherwise Xapo and BitPay would have already switched...
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:48:59
I think propaganda has influenced your perception. Vitalik Buterin spoke about the supply cap here : 
101M ether by the year 2128
103M ether by the year 5189
Development is all but centralized, unlike Bitcoin Core there are several clients and development teams, parity, geth...
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:01:01
LOL, Ethereum not impressive ? Go back to your den, dragon.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:19:06
I'd love a version with ETH logo instead of BTC :)
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:52:36
Bitcoin fees are too expensive for day-to-day usage. Maybe in November when we get rid of Core.
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:05:26
LOOL, worse than central bank. All hail core team.
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:28:55
LOL! :)
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:18:09
Sorry you can't spin this one :)
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:46:27
Whaat, , how is this legal ?!?!
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:01:11
LOL, the only hypocrite there was Charlie.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:10:23
How difficult is it for Poloniex support to look up the provided support ticket # and say it's fake if it is ? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:48:16
I believe you. I had to wait 2 full months before someone responded to my ticket asking for an increase in withdrawal limit...
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:27:50
ETC had less than 1% of ETH hashpower yet no one had the tools ready to attack it.. I think an unsuccessful attack on BCC will definitely happen...
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:02:52
ban incoming :)

GBTC is Barry Silberts mega scam for the gullible.
