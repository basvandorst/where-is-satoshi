The problem is that the feature is enabled but never asked for a email so I dont have the nlock time files. Is weird that the systems enables a feature that depends of email and allows to do it without an email address.

My wallet is 2 by 2, I just lost the f2a and the ntimelock option is set by default but without email address, thats really weird how a feature that depends of an email can be enabled without, is really big failure. So basically I enter with my encrypted or not mnemonics, my encription passwords works ok but as I dont have the google authenticator and no email is registered for the ntime I only can see my money.  No ntimes to recover 2 by two of my two wallet..

How you got on touch with them?I'm willing to pay to recover my money. I'm sending emails, posting at reddit and they did not contact me .I lost my laptop and cellphone a long time ago. At beginning I did not worry because both were encrypted and I had a backup of my mnemonics. I made yesterday two transfers from my bitfinnex account to my greenaddres. But for my surprise when I was to make my payments, I sincerely never used this wallet in more than one year but decide to use due the amount of btus and the security reviews, I was asked for my google 2fa sincerely I never remember because never ask when I log in so I now have my money locked or lost. Any help I contacted support and nothing. I have my mnemonics encrypted and not the passphrase the pin and I can proof even the day I create the wallet one year ago as well my encryption passphrase is my brazilian social security number. Also all transaction I made were between my own accounts. Worse I never settled up an email address so no ntime. I will appreciate any help. Also the app fails for don’t require or advice to register an email address for recovery your money they only ask to save your mnemonics. I still have the origina print with the date and time I created my wallet of the mnemonics and all the passwords
