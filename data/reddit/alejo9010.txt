can u recomend me a website? that accept wire transfer?
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:55:16
so any good wallet with multicrypto support.. this is just stupid 40$ for 170$ lol
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:30:48
can i use my private keys to move my btc to another wallet? that let me configure it ? i dont want to pay 30$ for a btc transfer. and btw which wallet can u recomend ?
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:44:28
If i set it to lower fees (no recomended) it still give like 25$ fess, average fee is 30$
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:43:16
hello i tried electrum with my private keys, but still the lowest fees here is like 30$.. that if i send everything from my 3 address, if i try to send like 40$ theres almost no fee, i just want to figure out whats going on, i have 3 address 2 with like 3 tx and one with like 62
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:57:42
i know its not about the amount im sending... its about bytes size, but my question is how to i prevent my wallet of becoming a large size one? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:16:14
but i only have one address for payout in my pool
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:21:10
so in less words, just send all my bitcoin at once to another address with realy low fees and wait for days for it to get there?
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:46:33
im sending from electrum wallet to poloniex
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:27:07
lol ? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:35:37

edit: and how do i known when it clears?
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:08:00
