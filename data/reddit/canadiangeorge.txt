I was a day trader in my past life.  It looks like this system uses price feeds - can I short or buy at select % variances from the feed?

I heard bitshares would be better than both of those, just what I've read past few days here

Someones got to tip this guy off about bitshares decentralized exchange
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:27:18
what are your thoughts on bitshares?  I just read they are doing the market peg thing

I've been thinking that Bitcoin is going to be huge with the advancements other Blockchains are bringing to the space.  What is this decentralized exchange going to have done for the space in five years?

I've heard BitShares has 200% reserve banking, it's apparently going to launch soon.  Any insight?

Thanks for posting this.  Hopefully crowd funding will be legal entirely in the US soon.  But if it's not -- BitUSD will circumvent this, right?

What I've learned about waste I learned can be solved on the blockchain - Daniel Larimer taught me not to waste - how to understand decentralized exchanges - and grasp freedom and economics on the blockchain

bit assets, the collateralized IOUs, are created by shorting the value of the asset with bitshares as collateral, however, they are better described as fungible derivatives contracts without expiration dates, where the collateral is held in escrow by the blockchain

bitshares more likely

So how can you be sure they won't be MPAs, and the banks and IBM hold the shares of the exchange?
