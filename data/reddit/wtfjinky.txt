Exodus is a multi coin wallet that has support for those coins. Its easy to use and allows you to control your own private keys.

This is what I did. 
Exported private key from my wallet. Sent my btc to another wallet. Import private key into bcc coinomi wallet on phone. Sent bcc to viabtc trading account. After 1 confirmation traded it to BTC. Withdrew the BTC after 20 confirmations of the bcc. Worked fine for me.

Financially doing nothing is better. The electricity will cost a lot more than you will make.
