FYI :) &gt; We just put USPS back on our site, we had some issues with a few of the customers and their packages not being delivered and USPS would not take the responsibility.

Hey everybody,
Zlatko from Bitcoinstore here, I just wanted to give you all an update. We worked everything out with Ingram Micro - the partnership continues on good terms. They don't seem to understand what is going on in the world. After an 1 hour talk on the phone, explaining Bitcoin to them (yes you guessed it) they are still confused!!
Don't worry, they will come around!
Happy shopping! :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:22:32
We are experiencing SSL Issues with our provider so we took the site down, should be up shortly. 
It is not the death of Bitcoin don't worry! :)
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:01:20
Unfortunately, there was issue on Comodo's side of things. It was set to expire in december. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:39:02
Thank you for the feedback! This comes at a great time because we are getting ready for a relaunch and we are definitely fixing a lot of the issues. Stay tuned, we will make sure to post the launch on Reddit.
As for the shipping estimate, once you have items in the cart:
1. Hover over the Cart Icon/Button at the top right
2. Click on View All
3. At the bottom left of the page you will see a "Shipping Estimate" widget.
Feel free to reply if there is anything else that I can help with.
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:41:09
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-07-13 18:26:38
Thank you! Yes we are planning on staying around for a long time and expanding our catalog.
@_date: 2014-07-13 18:30:56
We operate on a drop-ship basis with our vendor, Ingram Micro. We do not hold any inventory in-house, our entire team is completely decentralized. We did start BitcoinStore when BTC was only $25, so our profit is/was based on the growth of Bitcoin. We based our business around Bitcoin to give people the option to have tangible items for Bitcoin since nobody else was doing that at the time. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:08:14
We are back!
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:24:39
We are a business that holds their bitcoin, we do not convert to fiat. We currently have about 250K products, some major updates coming to our website very very soon. :) Happy shopping!
@_date: 2014-04-26 06:40:58
Your feedback is much appreciated. The good news is: we are re-launching soon! Majority of the focus has been search, UI/UX, and a larger number of products. Hopefully you can stick around to see that soon :)
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:59:52
There is a drastic improvement to our search functionality on the new website. Trust me we have been trying to fix the search on magento (our current platform) and we have not had luck with it. We are completely moving away from Magento to a better piece of software. Hopefully you can stick around to see the changes - feedback would be appreciated!
If you have further questions you can use our support ticket system, or I can PM you my email address to get in touch with me directly.
@_date: 2014-01-18 20:01:20
It is not late, it is still very early.
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:42:54
Thank you for checking with us in the first place! The support is much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-07-13 18:32:12
Very glad to hear that!
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:40:47
Thank you. We are still open for business so feel free to continue shopping. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 18:25:57
Thank you!!
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:41:38
We may have something better in the works :) stay tuned...
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:42:10
Thank you for your support! It definitely feels good to be the first major retailer!
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:48:12
This is one of the reasons we launched. Comments like that. We want Bitcoin to be a reputable way to transact money online. While we do not necessarily disagree with the ideological side of the Silkroad, Bitcoin can do so much more.
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:46:02
We're working on it, unfortunately serving International customers better is lower on our list than getting the site functioning. You'll continue to see improvements to international experience as the site develops and grows.
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:41:08
We're moving to a way better server before the actual grand opening :) 
Thank you for the link! (Also, happy cakeday!)
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:43:18
Roger Ver is a public figure, his other business does 10m a year in revenue, he's also one of Bitcoin's biggest advocates. I doubt you can find a single Bitcoin business owner that will not vouch for him.
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:45:06
We like like you ;)
We sell mostly electronics. You might be able to find some sort of weird non-electronic, I think you can find some office supplies, but we're mainly focused on electronics.
@_date: 2012-11-03 23:28:54
The minimum order price will be decreased in a couple of days.
@_date: 2012-11-03 22:50:24
Thanks for the kind wishes! We're aiming high and yes, international shipping should be more fair once we're out of beta.
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:49:21
Let me know which products you're seeing as overpriced. Our prices tend to fluctuate, but with a bit of searching you can find some crazy deals.
@_date: 2012-12-16 02:01:23
Woo! Bitcoin!
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:48:36
How much did you save? :)
@_date: 2012-12-16 10:12:11
Any tips will go towards the promotion of Bitcoin! Thank you!
@_date: 2012-12-16 00:34:02
I agree, we're working on fixing it right now! You make a good point about mobile usage.
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:46:40
Make sure to tell others to check our prices before they order electronics too!
@_date: 2012-12-16 02:30:52
Woo! Bitcoin allows awesome savings. And yes, the accordion menu will die.
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:39:18
Hi Julian!
Thanks for the post, unfortunately this is NOT the grand opening yet. We've just removed the $1000 limit.
We're shooting for a January 1st launch.
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:39:43
We're fixing it. I hate it too.
@_date: 2012-12-16 02:30:21
Working on it!
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:42:04
We're still working on perfecting the shipping options, but they are significantly better now!
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:44:12
The goal of this site is to **FORCE Amazon and NewEgg to accept Bitcoin**. 
Simple as that. We don't need to accept any other form of payment to make them accept Bitcoin to compete with our pricing.
@_date: 2012-12-16 10:11:36
As he loves you!
@_date: 2012-11-03 23:05:22
We're working on adding Bitcoin as an option. It is much easier for consumers to compare if we use USD.
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:41:38
We're still in Beta for this reason! We'll have it fixed soon, thank you for the feedback.
@_date: 2012-11-03 23:15:51
We're adding it as an option soon! Thanks for the feedback, we're looking forward to your business!
@_date: 2012-12-16 00:33:28
It's Jon actually, but they are the words of our good lord and savior, Roger Ver
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:32:30
Roger says: "I pay about 2.5% to CC companies, 3% for domestic paypal,  and 4% for international."
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:05:39
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:52:01
We have done more than $600,000 in orders. We handle all of our customer support proficiently and efficiently. I don't think we've had any major problems, but if you have any specific concerns please let me know!
Also, by using us, you support a stronger Bitcoin! Hopefully we can force NewEgg to start accepting Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:05:00
We've attempted to contact them with no avail. If you know absolutely anyone with a contact at the Raspberry Pi Foundation please let us know!
@_date: 2013-04-01 01:11:36
Basically this month. It was amazing watching all the sales roll in!
@_date: 2013-04-01 00:46:21
We can. It's very expensive at the moment so we're not targeting Canadians until we can give you the most savings. 
If you're not seeing the option on checkout, let me know and we can fix it :)
@_date: 2013-06-23 19:08:46
This is a huge target demographic for us.
They are users who greatly appreciate the discounts Bitcoin can provide... and are technical enough to comprehend and use common bitcoin clients!
@_date: 2013-04-01 05:21:01
Yeah, giving out news on April Fools is a bad idea!
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:08:24
I can guarantee you that EVERYONE will be updated :)
Thank you for your cooperation and honesty!
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:43:25
We focus on what we're good at. Once we get big enough we can bully suppliers into giving us deals on snacks and grocery items.
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:56:53
Thank you for your kind words. Would you be able to email sales with your order number? I can check to see what caused that issue, hopefully it's something we can prevent from happening again. 
(waiting for your email..)
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:47:24
You can test out our shipping calculator on the cart, I don't know off-hand.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:03:57
Trust me, I know.
But hey, Bitcoin. What can you expect!
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:09:04
We're back up.
@_date: 2013-03-31 09:22:25
Even if we don't get to renew our current contract with Ingram we'll just get a slightly worse contract.
We'll still be in business!
@_date: 2013-05-29 22:41:19
Thank you so much for the review. Changes to the navigation are coming!
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:06:49
We're doing zero margin, plus the savings from lower processing fees.
I think we're actually making money with the rising BTC price! :)
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:42:54
Fixed, we force https on all links. Thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:44:26
This sort of posts reminds us to turn off order processing in times like these ;)
@_date: 2013-05-29 22:44:45
I recommend looking at the generic items. We do not always do the best on brand items, since the larger stores are able to cut deals with the manufacturers directly and cut out their luxury margins. Even so, we're competitive on pricing for most of our brand items.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:19:18
PM me an order number and I'll grab an update for you.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:03:18
We couldn't continue our contract. Increased prices. It'd suck.
Luckily we're very close, I think we'll be able to extend it!
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:29:45
We're not exactly a for-profit business.
We had good days when the price went up, we're having okay days now. We're more worried about whether our customers feel comfortable to spend than about the bottom line.
@_date: 2013-01-17 02:30:53
We're working on it!
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:01:00
Yeah, the real petition is called BitcoinStore.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:06:05
Support, coding, all the good things in life. We're scaling up pretty much everything.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:40:57
We're making a post about the processing times right now.
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:09:42
It is, if you login into your wallet there is a "Partner" section on the right-hand side where you should be able to see Gyft &amp; Bitcoinstore. It will take you directly to our site.
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:42:35
We do, but it eats up a lot of the savings. If you want to support us, we'll thank you profusely but you'll take a big hit on the savings.
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:55:30
Thank you for the feedback - yes we are working on all aspects of our site and continue to strive for greatness. Major improvements coming in the near future. We are growing our team to make this happen a lot faster. Hopefully you can still find something that you can purchase :)
We will make an announcement once we are ready to present the entire world with our new website.
-Bitcoinstore Team
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:25:50
No, Bitcoinstore is NOT owned by Blockchain. We are 2 separate entities.
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:12:18
Good question.
We will most likely continue the good fight, but with slightly worse pricing.
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:05:53
We're switching some things around... More news tomorrow :)
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:27:41
Want screenshot proof that we got hit with a DDoS?
I assure you we're in it for the long haul. I've been around Bitcoin since it dropped to $2. $70 is a luxury. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:57:14
Currently we are only working with major vendors/distributors, but nonetheless we are always open to new products. Feel free submit an email to sales and I assure you a response.
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:10:46
Merely one of his disciples.
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:00:03
The hard drive are on their way!
@_date: 2013-06-29 02:32:09
I got excited.
Then disappointed.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:05:25
International shipping is a problem we're looking to solve. We've found a couple options we're exploring.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:08:17
We're already at zero margin.
@_date: 2013-03-23 12:17:33
Shot us an email - on our contact page.
@_date: 2013-08-03 23:21:54
Honestly, the average consumer shouldn't use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a better backbone than the banks will ever be. Just as you use Paypal instead of interacting directly with banks, there needs to be an intermediary for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:24:22
My pleasure!
@_date: 2013-06-29 02:32:57
It is essentially a giant list for states (which apply the actual regulation) to check against.
It's no big accomplishment and should have been done years ago.
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:31:43
Check on the additional info page: Packaged Quantity 20
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:06:35
Announcement tomorrow. :)
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:07:28
I can chat with Roger and see how much he normally pays to processor companies on MemoryDealers.com
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:04:09
We're working hard on it!
Search is very hard to perfect or even tweak. There's a reason Google makes so much money!
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:16:33
Enjoy! and thank you for the tip!
@_date: 2013-05-29 22:42:59
Well, it's mainly Bitcoin. If we accepted credit cards, we'd have to pay between 2-4% on each order. The zero markup helps, but even with a normal discount store markup we'd be competitive, if not better.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:47:05
Insanely fast as long as it isn't backordered!
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:08:59
Thank you very much and I hope that you continue to come back and shop with us.
@_date: 2013-10-30 23:32:58
Great to hear! Don't worry we are working hard to make all sorts of improvements :)
@_date: 2013-07-29 21:51:09
Was it a Treasury building at least?
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:06:16
Thank you for being our customer!
@_date: 2013-06-05 10:32:56
The underlying assumption here is that Bitcoin is your sole currency. 
A more likely assumption is that the consumer will use Bitcoin as a complimentary currency.
I suspect that many consumers will use Bitcoin as a payment processing network. That means they will only *hold* bitcoins long enough to spend them. There will be no economic incentive for hoarding.
I don't think we need to worry about Bitcoin as the sole currency for many many years.
