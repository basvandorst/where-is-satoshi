Hey-- ipfs author here -- note that we do not control the "ipfs" user account, so take whatever says with a grain of salt. It's not us.
 thank you for creating this subreddit and posting the video! it would be really useful though if you could use a different account name, as it it clearly confusing users.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:25:48
well put! :)

Think of it like Git and Bittorrent in one. Here's an older tech talk I gave which goes over the ideas:  or if papers are your thing:   (yes this link is hosted with ipfs ;) -- dont worry about the ugly hashes, they're going away)
I will be updating with a new talk on the tech details soon. :)

"ipfs" it would be very useful if you did not use the name of the ipfs project to make political and financial conjectures -- many of which have nothing to do with ipfs. It is a misrepresentation that is bound to confuse people.

paavokoya: i'm the author of ipfs. before you dismiss it incorrectly, i'd recommend you read the paper:  -- or watch the videos at  --  ipfs is not about bitcoin. it's about a new model for the web.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:26:34
Yeah, Bitcoin inspired us very much, but that's more towards Filecoin. Git, BitTorrent, and SFS are more the inspiration for IPFS.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:38:37
Exactly right. not about storage. thanks super3.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:29:08
He really is.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:30:03
would you mind reading this guy for 2 hours then?  ;P
you're totally right though -- we need a 2 min video explaining it. it's coming-- just not quite there yet. (so much to do!!)
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:38:07
Author of IPFS here-- it isn't blockchain storage. IPFS can be used to store blockchains, and it can be used _by_ blockchains to store data, but it's not explicitly about that. (It's like saying HTTP is just for storing pictures of cats. ...wait... :D )
 i appreciate the enthusiasm and wanting to share our project with the world (thank you!!) but would you mind not using an account named `ipfs`? its confusing for users who think this account is official...
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:28:07
hey  -- it would be great if you didn't post comments like these under the name "ipfs". it's misleading to others who might think the project is strictly about financial services. It isn't, it's general, like the web. It would be great in general if you didn't use the name `ipfs` :( --- it's bound to create more confusion.

ipfs doesnt guarantee availability, it's a protocol that describes how to structure the web so that websites can be seeded, much like torrents or other p2p systems.
to get guaranteed availability, you can either hope your content is popular  (which means others will want to seed it) or  "hire" replication services (this can be _any_ service, something like S3, or something like our filecoin.io).
the crucial part though, is separating publishing from hosting-- that is, making it possible for you to publish content in the web, and for other computers (third parties) to _host_ it for you, without having to _trust_ those third parties to be good.

Don't mean to sound patronizing-- just pointing out that IPFS has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies -- a reply to your comment about "shitcoin". Many of our users are already using IPFS without any link to cryptocurrencies -- they are doing their own storage. see my answer here:  Filecoin is a _related but separate_ project.


Entirely agreed. This is an alpha, we're well on our way, but most of the road is left to go. Hopefully this will work but we can't know yet!


Would you be willing to take a bet? :D
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:33:02
 author of IPFS here-- Filecoin is not required for IPFS, or viceversa. They are sister projects, but as good engineering demands, separate. So, complementary, but you can use either without the other. Filecoin is our answer to "how do we make storing data on the web trustless and automatic". IPFS is our answer to "how can we make the web distributed"? clearly related, but different technically. Some of IPFS use cases have nothing to do with cryptocurrency at all -- for example server deployments inside data centers. or version control of wikis.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:36:00
Yeah, people Filecoin is meant to be used with IPFS, but they don't have to. they can use any other hosting protocol, like MaidSafe or StorJ -- or even the most common ones, like S3 or storing files yourself.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:13:55
Exactly-- fully distributed web is what we're going after.
On the semantic web point, it turns out that we can add the full power of semantic web to tree-based datastructures. See JSON-LD:  -- we'll be investigating the merits of adding a way to add a similar ` to ipfs objects, but note it will of course be optional (as much in ipfs).
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:22:52
Thanks super3! good answer.
I'd add that IPFS is a protocol for the distributed web. All the storage system protocols (Filecoin, Storj, Maidsafe, etc) can use IPFS as a common layer of addressing and replicating websites and web applications. Think of it like an "IP" layer for files.
