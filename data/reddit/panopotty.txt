actually maxwell lied. that pgp thing was actually in at the time and the statement by maxwell not wright was bs
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:11:52
i did try. it is piss easy. it is in the code and it was listed in the standard in 07...
wayback machine... duh

Satoshi or not, wright has an audited 100,000 or more bitcoin in a signapore co he owns.
he is a bigblocker
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:05:46
it is sock puppets
any one can setup 10,000 implementations 
that is all
no costs to the attack
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:17:31
1 hash = 1 vote
i can setup 10,000 nodes
that is 10,000 votes and it is for less than the cost of joining a pool
sounds like a sock puppet to me
there are no user - one wallet senarois here
no costs to a new node.
that is corrupt
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:38:28
what secret
the provider was run by a co in panama called high secured.
there is an indictment the guys in charge and court docs
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:30:30
oh giving sockpuppets votes...
what bitcoin fixed... you want that back as it is easy to manipulate
not a fan, but this is stupid
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:39:03
Actually, the future you note is the one listed in the standard.
You did not try to hard to check did you...
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:01:42
wright has appointed others so his name is not there now and has trsust hold the shares, but the history is his.
the co. also is a large co, under sg regs
so it is required by law to be audited and the audit had 100k coins as assets.
large co.s are reported. there are accountants and lawyers who can get copies for a fee and this co that wright started (and put into a holding trust) has over 100k coin.
@_date: 2017-03-31 08:05:21
no for all those.
maxwell and others say these are fake, but that is not the case
and the computer was real. The us siezed it last year... there was a case on the people who ran it... 
we have validated 6 masters and 2 doctorates so far. wright did not comment on them when he was attacked and let us all believe is fake but they are real
there is more coming on him. 
we are the ones who leaked the info to the ATO you wanker.
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:23:01
clearly you have not read the code and seen what it does
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:40:57
so PoS
And miners pay themself huge tx fees that they get back...
not well thought through
@_date: 2017-03-31 07:46:53
you think I am wright....haha
i was trying to out wrigth so he pays the tax on the coin he moved you dick
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:43:04
if he dump then there are no miners to do it and it fails
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:51:41
we have managed to confirm that his company that was called Denariuz and is now renamed to Demorgan pte ltd in Signapore has at least 100k coin.
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:41:25
Hashpower = Vote.
Buy a mining rig, that is how you vote
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:57:48
you have no idea that it is a miner or not
you think you can tell and thta is utter bs
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:16:38
there are already usaf code pushes
look on git
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:35:14




i used to work for wright
he has a shite load of systems that wopuld be thrown at this
@_date: 2017-05-03 16:06:16
did you listen to it?
Wright was rite.
that disk from the uni was saying you could break ECC and it was ot about wright signing at all...
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:37:01
satoshi key ws never used publikly either...
@_date: 2017-07-06 07:20:31
Yep Craig is a Junkie; a Knowledge Junkie!!!!
For those of you who have nothing good to say; why say anything?
@_date: 2017-07-06 07:09:55
easy to cee core lies
again more core bs
@_date: 2017-07-06 06:25:16
the real post was 
This post goes to those cowards who sit behind anonymity on the web and cast
doubt and aspersions about people whilst hiding. I note that most defamatory
comments are anonymous. Cowards!
An anonymous poster (not this list, but the person I suspect does subscribe
to this one)  stated that there are doubts with my qualifications. Anonymity
is the shield of cowards, it is the cover used to defend their lies. My life
is open and I have little care for my privacy - so in my case this is an
easy charge to defend."
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:37:15
wright said on slack to a few ppl that if segwit activates
he would not abandon his coin
he would run transactions at fee costs
basically congesting the network to 100% 
then move to sw coin txs and move them back and forth till it all dies
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:26:23




that fails the diff from dec 15 to may 16
if wright could pr in 16 he could have in 15
so you have a story to help make him not for core.
