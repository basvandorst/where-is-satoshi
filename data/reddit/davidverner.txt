Interesting.  I wonder how many down votes this post will get from the bots.  I wonder why someone is also targeting this subreddit with down vote bots.

I meant like this as in dealing with civil rights.  I've been in court on the issue of civil rights and correspond with others who also been in court over civil rights.  Going in all confrontational will get you no where fast and threatening them to get your stuff back will cause them to circle the wagons blocking a lot of your chance to build up a case.
The best thing to do is to go in and see if you can get your stuff back.  You then follow that up with FIOA request for everything involved in that incident.  Then you move in with your complaint and possible civil case.
Do it the other way and you will be having issues to get evidence for a court case and you will trigger a possible cover up before you can get some good evidence to back up your case.

Have you ever been to court over something like this?

Don't issue threats like this.  This will not work well in the courts.  His rights have been violated and he should sue the PD after he recovers his wallet.

Rights were violated in this case and any lawyer worth their salt will take this case pro bono.

Oh that didn't take long.  Ya, I posted three of those.

Incorrect public officials working in official capacity have no expectation of privacy.  Decided in 1st District Courts in the [Glik v. Cunniffe]( case.  This came out of Massachusetts.

Can you cite the Supreme court case?  
I'm only aware of two cases making it to the District Court of Appeals and the one I can recall of the top of my head right off the bat is 
[Glik v. Cunniffe]( that specifically deals with recording police.

Closest your going to get in justice from the system is a check coming from the tax payers.  You can thank the system for this.  If we can pile on enough financial hurt on the system then we can effect change at some point.

She's pretty sarcastic about Citicoin.

Is MintChip even still a thing?  I haven't heard that name in a few years.

When government agencies start accepting other currencies you  can be sure that it will gain acceptance in other places.

Let's see Iran, Iraq, and Libya are all great examples of United States meddling.

I will just say bye to him because there was nothing good that came out of this.

I heard about that today on the radio.  It was only a matter of time.  The question now is who's pulling the strings and who will gain from it.

Reminds me when you get those pathological liars and you call them out.

Well I need to figure out how to move that full node data from one computer to another computer now that I know I need to download 10 gigs of data for a wallet now.  Bandwidth caps suck were I'm at.
@_date: 2013-09-28 13:35:38
Does the bitcoin wallet have to download all of that data to function?  Because I've been trying to establish a wallet this week and its taking for ever to update.  
@_date: 2013-09-28 14:20:21
Thanks I was wondering why it took for ever to update and slow my internet down.
