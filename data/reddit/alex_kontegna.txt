That's what I'm talking about. Sticking to ledgers/consensus topic narrows the expanse of possible backstories to pump. Whatever you do with/around coins, you're nada opposed to by-Lindy-effect-protected Bitcoin. 
If I were to pump a coin, I'd use a straight-forward Omnilayer asset that would use its metadata to prophesy all good against everything bad.

21M will most probably remain forever. Here's why. 
(1) I bet the no-second-emission-ever thing is probably THE most important feature. It is easily understood by every potential user (unlike the property of being distributed). And it is likely to be the most appreciated (unlike publicly viewable transactions). 
(2) This feature mimics the design of the Universe where no energy can be created or destroyed. Somehow it works, despite the fact that properties like "once pushed flies forever" are hard to accept intuitively as natural.

Just trying to estimate how much could that be in USD annually in the best case scenario. The only way that comes to mind is to take the entire ad revenue (which is what... half trillion I don't know); Pareto rule leaves 1/5 to the "insignificant" part (real estate remains with site owners no matter what happens to the RTB infrastructure). So $50B can be redistributed. The industry makes money on (again) 1/5 of the golden billion people. So it's 250 bucks per person per year. Not much. 
But I don't think it's about the money. It's about the stability of the marketplace. Fair rules and absence of restrictions work well. But I support your view that those who are interested in paid actions represent the worst type of audience.

Colu, Omni or Counterparty asset (that is one-time single emission, i.e. technically restricted from any additional issuance) is a trustless coin over the stable Bitcoin blockchain. So this comparison with cheap scams as Onecoin is not correct.
I'm not sure, though, how do you guarantee no one can ever emit more coins. Someone will have a chance to see the private key at the even of initial emission. Can it be exploited and destroyed without anyone having access to it? Not sure.

The sophistication of the two-mover with short selling does not match the complexity of the hack itself.
I would rather suggest that--once the hacker got all the tools ready for the attack--he just sat and waited for the downward movement. That is an excellent way to send the pursuers on a false trace. Now everybody is checking out who shewed himself two days prior making short deals.
This version is also supported by the fact that there were reasons out there for the price decline: the meeting, the fake fork, the expectation of EU regulation.

Bear raids with all the Wall St moneis are BY FAR less dangerous that those kinds of attacks orchestrated by ver/miners/etc. And we did survive a handful of those. No vicious cycle is possible because no real economic damage is possible.
Clearly, speculators can gang up to drive the price down with a rush of short sales, but at some point, other traders — impressed by the Bitcoin idea and overall asset health — would see BTC as a bargain and higher demand would cause the price to stabilize and rise. A bear raid would, therefore, have no lasting effect. 
It is only if the falling price caused by a bear raid does REAL ECONOMIC DAMAGE to the asset (if Bitcoin would a firm and some of its managerial accounting parameters suffered), other (more loyal) investors are likely to dump it as well, causing a vicious cycle of a falling price and even more economic damage that would make the bear raid even more profitable. But Bitcoin is not a firm. No fundamental parameters can be altered by bear raids.

It maybe more than the Stockholm one (it is actually a Channel Island registered fund traded in Stockholm). 
Bitcoin ETI is the exchange traded instrument listed on the Gibraltar stock exchange and traded in Frankfurt stock exchange. The management fee is 1.75% and the overall markup is not clear. Neither is the current status of the asset. The company behind the fund markets itself under the name “Revoltura Ltd.” and the legal entity that signed the prospectus is iSTRUCTURE PCC PLC, both in Gibraltar. Although the thing looks legit, its actual performance is questionable—my quick research raised all sorts of red flags.

Strangely, the more important outcome is discussed and investigated less. There're so many quantitative predictions on what happens if it's approved. Of course, it will go up. As for me, I will be happy with $1.5k, $3k, $10k price. Whatever. Pretty much equally happy.
I would be much more interested looking at some reasonable analysis on what happens if it's NOT approved. How much of the current price already incorporates the expectations of the positive outcome. I think, I saw only one article by some Chinese gentleman, that's all.

Of course, people should be buying themselves but the two systems need to be COMPETING to make life better. That takes some interconnection. ETF may be a good component of that interconnection or maybe not. We need it alive to check it out.
If not this interconnection, we wouldn’t be able to measure how great our dear bitcoin is (its price against the dollar). Pure absolute parameters of bitcoin such as merchant adoption are very very weak. Despite all the investment advantages of bitcoins, it is yet looking deeply contradictory as a payment media, since the built-in deflation doesn't correlate with the principles of consumerism, on which the entire society stands.
We only look strong with a poor «obsolete» industry in the background. Yet. 
The state agency did what it had to, honestly speaking. My personal hopes for the positive decision were based only on the fact that the current administration would want to use this chance and play risky and divert attention. They just probably don’t comprehend the thing so decided not to interfere.
I think Bitcoin is wrongfully thought to represent a fatal threat to nation-states, governments, and fiat monetary systems which actually hold those states afloat. States can very well put both emission-payment systems in a viable mode of coexistence and fair COMPETITION, as it already happened with the brute-police-military-force structures, which states used to rule in a monopolistic manner in the past. Earlier they had the monopoly on the ideology component of the Rule (religion). Governments get more flexible and smarter. I don't think the monopoly on money is really their last fortress.

The problem is that you—being inaccurate and driven by preconceived opinions—use an undefined term in your speech: namely, "survive". It doesn't mean anything before carefully described in a precise auditable legal form. The given fund in Sweden—whose guarantor Global Advisors is—actually addresses the issue on their website and in the prospectus (why would they if this is not an issue, maybe they never read the mentioned white paper?):
"WHAT HAPPENS IF BITCOIN FORKS?
The exact action taken will, of course, be decided on a case by case basis, but if bitcoin would fork, it would most likely mean that an alternative protocol to bitcoin core has attracted more mining power/proof of work, and in that instance, the underlying asset would be the coin with the most proof of work behind it. The other coin would be sold and the value added to the instrument. If there would be a situation where it would not be clear what coin would be the dominant one in terms of proof of work/mining power, the instrument would reflect the total value of both coins until there was a clear winner. We will do all we can to maximize value for investors and make sure to give notice to all investors on any actions in good time."
@_date: 2016-12-20 13:09:13
Right. We all would "feel" the obvious difference between the main coin and a spring-off. 
But once you try to translate that into a quantifiable language of a financial auditor — you will have fundamental difficulties on every step. What parameter will you start with? Will that parameter be easy to precisely measure? 
There is a good reason Winklewoss' ETF is not yet registered being delayed one time after another. The extreme difficulty of potential forking handling is good part of that reason, I believe. 
PS 
Well, I didn't dig into this particular issue of registered [and  audit-open] funds but I'm pretty sure there’s no “intuitive” mind gate there. I tried to make that sort of research in the fiat-over-blockchain issue, though: 
So I expect such funds won't go anywhere broader than Channel Islands or Gibraltar any time soon.

That's very cool. I wonder how did they manage the issue of auditing the fund's assets. It's interesting what is the storage method that their auditors accepted.

(1) That's just an opinion. And it's not even convincing. But, more importantly, everything can happen. Everything. You can prove the existence or possibility of something. You can't ever prove the non-existence or impossibility of something, including that of Bitcoin splitting into several currencies with more than one survivors. 
(2) Actually, a few seconds of coexisting is enough to file a lawsuit. It may be hopeless but still not free for a fund. 
(3) Regulators and asset managers must look into how to deal with this BEFORE they open a fund and invite investors. If they do not prepare and describe their course of action in a prospectus they will face troubles. Thus, this issue is slowing down the process of regulator's approval even if possibility of its practical occurrence is next to zero.

Of distant waves, or, of a summer,

People with somewhat longer experience in crypto, who read this sub, who are good at reading red flags, they may be envisioning some decent stuff like iota or adt when the word "ICO" is pronounced. However, for an average joe, ICO means all ICOs and those are really, really 99% total crap.

{Total supplies:}
Useless nominal figure. Doesn't mean anything. Coins could be divisible. Even knowing about divisibility doesn't add any useful information.
{Dev(s) dedicated premine:}
Many ICOs don't have a pre-mine technically. So it makes sense to indicate how many percent do ICO organizers reserve for non-public distribution.
{Buying with: }
Very useful information
{Running a social campaign:}
Not quite clear why would it matter for an investor and how to determine whether ICO organizers actually run a promo campaign or not. It could run elsewhere, among other audiences you can not see.
{Offer bounties:} 
No comment
{Bonus:} 
That could be either bonus or discount. 10% can be calculated as x1.1 or as N/(1-0.1). There's a difference.
Also, I would add the following information:
What blockchain is used: Bitcoin (what protocol, i.e. Counterparty, Colu, etc.), Ethereum (what type of smart contract), or is it a stand-alone clone of something, or even attempt to create something totally new.
What is actually the offer: what is being sold.
Also, I would make personal judgments whether a project needs the token they try to sell or could it go just without. Some projects should really go to ordinary equity crowdfunding platforms.

"lean towards small block; support decentralization"... Many people use this "small block = more decentralization" axiom. 
Could you please explain to a layman, new to the debate, to a person who just uses bitcoin in daily life and wants its value to grow, to a person whose main piece of knowledge about Bitcoin is that it is supposed to let us all economically interact without any go-betweens, to a person who always used this beautiful purpose to amuse friends at every party:
Small block size is what we currently have and have been having lately, right? Over the years, the level of decentralization seams to be LOWERING. Media, 2nd layer, fiat gateways, everywhere. Maybe it is a wrong feeling and the situation with decentralization is ok but it just doesn't feel that way. Bitcoin was supposed to be a 2p2 thing. Now I sense a dozen of corporate eyes staring at my back each time I send money. 
I understand that things might get a lot worse from where they are now, I just don't feel convinced hearing that axiom. Similarly, I feel strange when someone insist on using the "big blocks = hard fork" formula. Ok, the equation might be correct but it really reminds me of politicians abusing the word "motherland" which is supposed to be good by default. It is just not cool reading someone using bogey-words.

I partly agree. There are two things I wanted to do/draw attention to when posting this.
First, to troll numerous posts about "BTC&gt;once of gold" which are "idiocy", no doubt.
Second. There's one thing that amused me when I saw the chart. The lines are very close. That almost never happens when you try to look at things in GoogleTrends. 
The "topic" mechanism in GT is supposed to be based on a very intelligent algorithm; of course, the result of a "topic" IS correlated to the corresponding search term but it may be—and in most cases is—very far in absolute figures. "Bitcoin" has become a "topic" in GT. For example, "ethereum" hasn't, yet. 
Of course, portflio allocations (or the ecosystem market cap) can't be estimated with GT. But it does gove an idea. Try comparing "ethereum + eth + etc" with other altcoins; in many cases results are quite close. 
As to the fact that gold is of completely different nature I have to disagree. "Gold as an investment" is also a GT "topic" so it doesn't calculate peole who type such search phrase into Google. It reflects those who would like to learn about the process, current price, etc. I don't know why do you think people know how to invest to gold. I have worked in a mutual fund company for five years. People don't know that. Moreover, in many countries, investments into gold implies the need to trick around VAT. Also, gold is not an easy cross-boarder asset. So people do need to google "investment in gold" to do investment in gold.
One more thing is that most of those people who search "bitcoin" have never dealt with it, r/bitcoin &amp; bitcointalk readers and cryptocurrency enthusiast are in minority if we look at the entire GT subset we're talking about here.

even if it was for all visas, there's nothing big in that. This post is very important to illustrate that even here a junk, trivial, click bait content gains the most attention.

nah... that's too radical. It's not the real thing but I loved my Gran Turismo on my PS4. I even suppose it helped me to avoid a couple of collisions on my real WRX.
the derivative pyramid—standing on its vertex—IS a problem but for broader economy not for the underlying asset itself. Take oil producers for example, I think that more of a help than a harm for them.

"stock" can only be considered as an analogue of tokens whose features are limited to voting in a DAO. Such tokes are [almost] legit but are very very rare. "App coins" are completely different beasts. In most cases, such tokes are created and sold for the sole purpose of fundraising and hiding the fact of securities fraud.

Very true.
A cockroach can streak at 80 cm/s while rapidly changing direction to escape a well-aimed shoe. To move, a cockroach uses reflexes in the extremities only, no CNS.

this price chart is so unnatural. What's going on?

This is a controversial analogy. Canada, Australia, and NZ didn't fork so is life there really any worse? They don't hail the great Revolution, don't sign anthems in classrooms, don't have to pay taxes if they actually do not live in the country, they are allowed to more countries with no visas, the list goes on.

Who's talking about "power"? Why are changing the narrative and brining in irrelevant aspects? 10 shares represent the property and rights exactly corresponding to that of 10 shares.

why are you pretending you don't see the difference. Stock is a property, the part of everything a company owns. A coin is a part of "economy". Most coins do not represent any "economy" in any meaningful way. Especially when they are premined. Moreover, they undermine the value of other ("honest") coins that can be considered as economies. Such coins spoil the image of the community for outsiders and potential investors. For example, this current ICO bubble may do more harm to Bitcoin ecosystem development than the good from this market cap growth. Hell with Ethereum and the mob of useless erc20s, but it will backfire to BTC too.
