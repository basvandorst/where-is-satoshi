I'll start from ~0:30 when the conversation starts:
Reporter: Why is China closing the door (for Bitcoin) and how much indicative is that about the security of the transactions Bitcoin offers.
Papageorgiou: Let me tell you. The news about the announcements in China, Bitcoin community has received them very optimistically, because it was the first move of the second biggest economy of the planet..
Reporter: Which is diametrically opposite of the one America has.
Papageorgiou: I wouldn't say that exactly; China is required to take a cautious attitude like they do on their closed economies in which they do their own experiments in a way. So they allowed of Bitcoin to being used from civilians freely but cut off its use on their banks and organizations, which is quite logic since they don't want to undermine the value of their coin.
Now America is more positive to this because they've seen it for more years. China has realized what is going on with Bitcoin the last 6 months and this was the first official announcement from their government.
Reporter: Lets do a small "parenthesis" that is required for the television and the viewers, just to remind that: Bitcoin is a digital currency which aspires to substitute the currencies that exist now- (and Papageorgiou interrupts him)
Papageorgiou: No i wouldn't go that far yet. It is a network that allows quick and cheap transactions worldwide.
Reporter: So it substitutes (the rest currencies) not as whole but more like an addition.
Papageorgiou: Additionally, additionally; it helps a lot for quick online transactions and it is completely decentralized, which might be its most important feature, that it doesn't have someone behind it (authorities, companies, organizations) to control and supervise it. That happens from the users clearly.
Reporter: So, going back to history, substantially, there are three categories that have gotten on the table: One is that it might be a "bubble"-.
Papageorgiou: Shall we talk about that now? So, Bitcoin is a technology, lets start from there, it's not a stock or some other material good which price goes up and down depending on the request, it is something new for the world. As a technology it has come by the last 5 years and it is still seeking its place in the market. That will show from its usefulness, that's where its value comes from, not from the parity it has with each local coin.
We could compare it like gold that can be transported to wherever we want in the world. Like with every technology, at first, what we call "price discovery" happens; it tries to find its place and its price and its role. Until now it looks like it is useful, solid as a system and works for secure transactions.
Reporter: I see, second: It is said and written that there might be dangers around the use of this web currency.
Papageorgiou: It is something new and- 
Reporter: Do you think that the new is fearful? 
Papageorgiou: Always, like in the beginning of Internet we couldn't find what was its use for, at the beginning of the telephone, Western Union itself said it won't succeed because no one needs it. There are dangers but they are dangers that with the proper education and with some right measures can be avoided mostly. This is the purpose of our company here of Neo &amp; Bee. We want to make its use more easy and simple to the everyday person so he can enjoy the advantages without worrying about the threats and him being the master of his money which is very important and that with any central authority you can't be so sure. But when you don't need trust to use a network like this thats when you can be sure.
Reporter: And the third category that was said is: If in the end the future users will get discouraged, if it doesn't find the role you say it seeks, if it doesn't find "fertile ground"
Papageorgiou: At the moment, what Bitcoin can do, is something that scientists are seeking for 30- 40 years now, ever since they realized that we can transfer information quickly without having some central connection, i.e. transferring a property without having someone third in the middle telling us what to do or being able to "put their hand" on what we are transferring. Think that it offers easily banking and money services to people that the only thing they need is Internet. At the moment there are around 5 billion people that don't have access to banking services. Bitcoin is a drop of hope for them that they can get embodied in the global market. One of our objectives is to be able to bring back, though our work and informing people, to bring Cyprus back to the forefront of the global market, from the part of technology not natural gasses and petrol. Because Bitcoin, at the moment, is something that is seeking for Home (a Country), authorities that can understand what are the advantages that can bring to the world and the liquidity it can bring to the economy and the money it can bring to the economy that looks at it more positively.
Reporter: Thank you very much.
