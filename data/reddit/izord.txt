I emailed them an hour ago and they responded shortly with "We are experiencing deposit processing delays. Please bear with us as we resolve the issues. Your deposit will be processed."  
You reminded me to check my email.

Hey yifu,  someone implies you have a functional asic but you don't have it turned on making money.  I just can't understand that.  Could you tell me why?  Thanks

It's just that no part of the scenario makes any sense at all.  There is no way I can look at it that it makes sense.

Do you really think someone has a functional Asic that is not plugged in making money?  Seriously?  
Every single functional Asic is plugged in chugging away full steam!

'Mining' is the work behind the network.  It's what makes bitcoin work.  It's the processing and validation of transaction.  It's what makes bitcoin so secure.  Mining is the 'heart' of bitcoin to the best of my not very deep but broadly correct understanding.

If so, that means there aren't any more functional asics.  Because no one is sitting on one right now.

No, it's been four hours.

Let me kind of rephrase what I'm trying to say:  This:  You're not going to ever buy an ASIC and make money mining bitcoin.  
If you're really smart and have really good connections in manufacturing High-tech silicon, You might make an asic, or a dozen asics and if they're good you might make a boatload of money by using them to mine bitcoin.  And then when the overall processing pool increases to the point that your asic is no longer making you money,  that is when they're not profitable anymore (because of the cost of electricity and storage space rent),  you can unload them on some suckers who preordered them.

Brother, I'm not trying to be too much of a smartass, but it just doesn't compute.  There must be a story behind it.  Do you see my lack of understanding?  Why would someone have a money making machine and not use it?  Tell me why.

Sorry, I just can't wrap my head around a scenario where someone has access to an asic and doesn't have it plugged in making money.  What would be the motivation?  apathy?  
Seriously,  Why would someone keep an asic on the shelf?  Clue me in please.
