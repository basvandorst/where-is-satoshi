Ross was never charged at trial with murder, murder-for-hire or anything violent. Don’t you think the government would have charged him if they had proof? They've already found TWO corrupt agents at the core of the investigation, and proof discovered post trial indicates that a 3rd tampered with evidence.  
Also “DPR” logged into the Silk Road 7 weeks after Ross was in prison. 
Here's what the prosecutor said at trial about attempted murder:

Even Wired and the government don't claim that anyone was murdered. And murder-for-hire was not charged at trial. No proof.

Yeah, that's just like the feds to hesitate to pile on charges. Too much effort? Are you for real? And if they just wanted a precedent for drug trafficking, why throw in money laundering, hacking and fake IDs. It's obvious they didn't have the proof.
