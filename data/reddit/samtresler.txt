So... you agree with me? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:18:05
No. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:47:03
Thank you.  For reason.

Ummm...... This is a little more fundamental than that, but I appreciate the notion. 
I want our S.V.P. of network to do an AMA someday, but basically, this is not about fixing a few routers. The internet is broken. New internet that is being made can be not broken, but it may not be feasible to fix the existing broken internet.

What the hell do you think rules are for? We should all just behave as if there were rules when there aren't? Ahh, the good old world of economic sportsmanship! Just like it used to never be.

Except me!

Yeah,  it's not like anyone actually bought what the insider was selling. .. oh wait,  the buyer did.

This rise makes me think a bubble is being purposefully created for certain. Economics, in general,  doesn't account for this value.

Golly, I wonder:

What? No, they could have called a cryptographic expert and offered them a citation for their expert opinion. You think they pay every single interviewee? Lots of experts would have jumped at the chance to be the "expert" that uncovered this hoax for a major publication. 
This isn't asking someone to redo your office network for free. It's asking someone to have free publicity for their company.

You can't buy a fraction of a stock because it is already a fraction of a whole that is defined. 1000 shares comprise one company. To buy 1/2000th, you'd need to restructure the stock offering, and because it is a shared company that would require approval of other owners.
What happens when you are part owner of a company and some ass is capable of putting you in business with as many other people as he wants without your consent?
It can happen frequently with splits or right before series funding, but requires board approval.
Coins, on the other hand, are very divisible without restructuring the whole.

Very much dependent on class of stock and rights associated with that class I think. 
I have founders level rights with a couple of companies and I would be pissed if more than the original number of founders got that.

These are journalists, not potatoes. Confirming credentials and references and corroborating stories is what they do. Sure, one charlatan will get past, but you can smell technical bullshit when the second or third expert has a different explanation.
 You can also check what else this expert has done. Ask people they've worked with, do journalism.

Uh, no. As a business that accepts Dwolla, I can tell you the fees are MUCH better for the seller and buyer, the bookkeeping is much easier than most merchant gateways, and you don't get the same hassle of credit card fraud everywhere that you do with CC processing. 
Dwolla is a good service in its own right.
