This is all a little too convenient: we can't give back your money (even if we had it), as all identities got stolen by hackers who can now impersonate anyone.

Also been happy with tunnelbear. Good speeds and reliable, plus ios/android apps (watching country restricted videos)

Guys, use [qbittorent](
* GPL v2, source is on [github](
* no spyware/malware/ads/third-party
* written in C++/qt meaning very fast (native)
* linux/windows/osx
* all the features I used to use with utorrent are present (rss, etc)
* active development (last update 22 feb 2015)

Very nice work.
One point, if I dare: I didn't see the mention of transactions being extremely fast and practically free. This is one of the biggest advantages of bitcoin compared with the traditional banking model and it should be highlighted somewhere. Perhaps under the "the bitcoin framework is" in the "digital" part.
I'll have a longer look at this tonight once I have time for a thorough read, but really really liking the infographic.

In the future, couldn't you prove his address by using the signed message and verify feature of the bitcoin protocol (feature also available in blockchain.info). 
I am not sure my understanding of how this would go is completely correct, but I imagine something like this: ask him to email you his btc address and amount to pay signed with his PGP public key. Once you have paid, sign a btc message thus proving you sent the money to his address.

Excellent journalism - explaining in very simple and identifiable terms what is bitcoin without getting bogged down in details and complexities.
