High Maintenance is *really good*.
No Bitcoin option, so I pirated it last week.

I'd like to. It's good work.
I don't use my credit card on the internet; PCI compliance only works when everything goes to plan. Hacks happen, and sharing my "pull-based" account information is foolish. Especially for a $1.99 purchase.
Shaming piracy doesn't work. Human behavior works on a spectrum and you will always have people pirating digital works. We can help people make better decisions by simply [allowing them to](

Dang, guy. This isn't a boycott. I just don't want to be baited and switched (i.e. A business SAYS they accept a currency, then I come in and "oops, you have to have some archaic, paper-based currency." no-go, son.
I don't have to consciously boycott. There are other restaurants in my area that actually accept bitcoin. I eat there, instead out of convenience. :)

Thanks. I've been annoyed with a restaurant that accepted for about 1 month and then stopped... Just gotta create an account and contribute. It's like Wikipedia.
To everyone claiming it's difficult: It wasn't for me. Signed up for an acct. Went to coinmap.org and clicked the asterisk (*) after the name in the listing, which opens up the OSM entry.. Then clicked edit. Easy.

Walked in, "You still accept Bitcoin here right?"  
\*smirk\* "nah, we stopped that long ago"  
Walked out.

Nobody "hacks" a credit card. They "hack" a database with order details. This can lead to credit card theft, but also identity theft.
Ever know someone who has had their identity stolen? It's not exactly "no harm" ... It's a nightmare.
This is all irrelevant, because I don't give a shit what conclusion a stranger on the internet has come to about my spending habits.
But srsly, nice psychoanalysis, kryptoBS
