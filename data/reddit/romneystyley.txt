Right, except Bitcoin doesn't represent the entire economy at this time.  I'm not sure we can draw any conclusions from what has happened on a larger scale in the past to Bitcoin now.

Nice post, just a note that it is not "NYC" (New York City).  It is NY (New York State) that we're talking about.

Down voted because the double negative makes it difficult to understand what you are saying.

Yeah, it is a pain, I ended up customizing my own live Ubuntu distro so I could make paper wallets with Armory.  I thought about sharing the effort, but it would only help fools since only they would trust it.

No idea about blockchain specifically, but I've been blocked by API's before for too many requests and had it expire after some hours.

AOL sucked, but it really helped bringing the internet to the masses.  Their advertising was huge.  Eventually everyone left for the real thing.

Prizes should be in BTC, not FIAT

After being "correct" about price trends several times with nothing on the line except held coins, I put .5 BTC as a test run into Stamp trying to increase my holdings by day trading.  Ended up taking out about .3 of it after some losing trades.  The problem was that I would get the general idea right and miss by a small amount on the actual numbers.  E.G. sell order at 500 and rally reaches 495 and then falls.
It's probably common for people to get the idea that they'll be successful because they know what the market will do fairly well.
I suppose I may be lucky that I didn't get lucky and make a bunch during my trial run which would have encouraged me to put more on the line.

No allignment needed.  Maybe my device/camera works better than others, but I scan qr codes usually before I even have a chance to worry about it.  As soon as camera activates, it reads the code even if it's not close to centered in the guide box.

Just remember this next time you tell someone new to bitcoin that their transaction will be confirmed in about 10 minutes.  Sometimes it's many multiples of 10 minutes.

Come up with a real business plan if you want my money.  Some bullshit banner ad is not going to do it.  Yes, BTC micro-payments or some other income stream is better.

Unsure why lack of anonymity would be a problem.  Unless you are surfing incognito over tor, the BTC payment is the least of your privacy concerns.  If you are able to surf anonymously, you should be able to make anonymous payments without too much more work.

It's pretty common for there to be 30 minutes or more between blocks.  Average confirmation time is not the figure you need to worry about, it's the longer ones.

Hi Gavin,
As a former Amherst resident I miss the food there.  What's your favorite restaurant to eat at in Amherst?  Favorite delivery?

Had a terrible first experience with Circle.  It says in big letters you can buy instantly, which I attempted on an account with 100% valid info.  The transaction failed and I was asked to supply a large amount of documentation.  Seems like a much more poorly run version of coinbase to me, at least they were up front about the documentation.

You're right to be, this is a really sketchy way to release firmware for this device.  It should be easily navigable from the main page on ledger, a signed ssl cert, and md5 sum.  Pretty disappointed in ledger for how this update is rolled out.
