Got it. I delete.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:15:15


Got it.
However, I'm not the first to publish a link to it.
And the news is good.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:55:05
I just-that's read it for the first time.
And this is even better for the stability of bitcoins.
Thank you very much for your help in understanding!

Thank you!
I understood!
Have a nice day!
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:48:34
Of course)
Everything has its time)
But you remember that it was a year ago? :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:17:52


Quite possible!
Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:55:14
`Merry Christmas!!!`

Did I understand the question correctly? Why will all coins be extracted faster?
Because there are new types of processors every 5-15 years.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:53:09










Thank you very much!
I did not know that!
That's cool. Satoshi is good!
So can only accelerate the transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:41:19


They do not need to have their coins. They can easily lower the price with futures. Futures are just an obligation.
But the market reacts to this.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:45:27
Bitcoin has a huge perspective.
I have no doubt that at first they will want to buy it .. and for this they will lower the price ... they will also earn money.
Thanks for the link! =)

Do you have a smart refrigerator?
Wow) That's cool.
Yes. People in all new are divided into two types - those who are ahead and those who follow the "leaders".
The first, of course, receive a risk .. but also a great chance.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:33:08


I think that bitcoin will act as a currency for large purchases.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:49:42










No one!
However, we can trace the trend. And on the basis of this tendency to draw conclusions and make decisions that can help us.

Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking will use exchange transaction records to safeguard customer bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:13:52
ОК! Thank you.
"Go home ur drunk"
And why insults?
Is that all you can do? Try to humiliate? It's a pity...

The same was with the car. Then - from TVs. Then - from the PC.
Then - with the Internet. Then - with the phone. Scalability of technology.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:47:40


Absolutely for sure!
I think the futures on the stock exchanges will help in the adoption.
Moreover, I think bitcoin is being prepared for the role of a "sideline" in the event of a crisis.
And yes. Bitcoin will become more like a way to save money, and not as a method of payment. But this is only after they begin to pay everything, as in Korea and Japan.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:44:06


Yes.) Moore's Law.
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:35:51


























If I understood you correctly, you were talking about the value of technology. And about the little-known technology.
Yes. This is true. As e-mail has grown thanks to the network effect, so will bitcoin grow.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:50:05


Why not?
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:41:17


I was probably a child then)))
Yes. So it will be with Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:11:40
I am sorry. I did not know that it was only English.
Already understood everything. Thank you!
I wish successes and blessings of God!
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:55:50


 You are not truly done!This is not a "price"\)This is a study from Fundstrat Research!
 Thank you! =\)
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:54:30
No, robot... no.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:17:05


Yes, I heard about the calculation of the block .. but did not know that there is a timer.
So, called the bomb complexity?
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:52:23
 You're welcome! 
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:29:31
\)\)\) Yes!
 But we know what he meant \)
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:51:37
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:51:40


 Hah\)\)Yes, it seems. However, he correctly calculated the MINIMUM value of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:57:28


 Not after him. But because there is no constant growth. **Everything is cyclical. Growth\-correction\-growth.**That's all\) 
@_date: 2018-05-11 18:53:49
Good luck!
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:53:25
 Will it be so?No!!!The price will be much higher! =\) 
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:35:23
Yes! Good news!
