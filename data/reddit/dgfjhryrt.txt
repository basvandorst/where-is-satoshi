I think so, he has good intentions and is fairly intelligent, he just doesnt understand bitcoin. btw heres the actual article 
@_date: 2018-08-01 10:32:04
why is the high in 2019, wouldnt it happen after the halving the same as the other times? around 2021?
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:06:12
well, Im not saying its impossible, but you are right, I havent read that story
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:14:46
I dont know why people think speculation is not important. its buying and selling, in this case fiat, just like you might buy and sell a pizza. cryptos happen to have proven to be a very convenient and accessible way to buy and sell fiat. in my opinion thats a sign that eventually the public will catch on that they are a convenient and accessible way to buy and sell anything
@_date: 2018-08-11 08:06:59
what do you mean by semi-log scale? isnt that a log scale?
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:30:09

pretty nasty example of a human being. guess i made some money off him but this really does put me off ever going into bcash again
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:50:05
Im not so sure, people are still going to want to use banks, and banks can use bitcoin to improve their efficiency.
@_date: 2018-05-21 06:29:28

@_date: 2018-05-25 09:17:13
yes, its bullish long term, except for the price just at the moment. a miner detail no doubt
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:14:18
Im as left wing as they come, as far as I can tell and have been told, and Im all in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:16:48
I was referring to the article being about miners

I would like to read more about why moving averages dont produce profit long term, if you have a source.

its pretty difficult to eat your own dick, but Im sure he would happily eat a shit instead
@_date: 2018-05-23 08:35:13
if the 15% is upwards then you've made a good profit, and long term bitcoin goes up. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:28:20
well, unless Im mistaken the writer of this article found he made a mistake and the premise of the article is invalid?
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:37:52
hmmm, I get a feeling your good at photoshop. in any case that $3000 should last him (you?) a while
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:52:11
I dont see how bitcoin can be regulated, only its conversion to and from fiat that can be regulated. the article doesnt really explain what it means by regulation
@_date: 2018-08-04 13:52:13
lived there 15 years, I dont think 10 year old hookers play any bigger role in the economy then in any western country, unless perhaps you are an NGO that collects money under the pretense that it does.

if thats the case them you are welcome to send me a few satoshi
@_date: 2019-03-03 10:01:01
tabs are standard in Thailand, altho not always a good idea as they are a scamming lot and, altho its not common it happens regularly, they will pad your bill and security will beat you senseless if you dispute it.
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:07:18
very true, so a dump down to about $1300 is a possibility
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:36:48
yes, everything is a risk, even fiat. all you can do is follow the trend.
@_date: 2018-10-13 06:58:24
if you are already holding then what else do you have to spend?
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:47:18
while thats good advice its generalizing a little, a quick glance at that chart shows you still have a chance at getting in at around 2200 or so
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:50:38
how long does 20 confirmations take, roughly?
@_date: 2018-10-13 06:10:16
maybe we dont care about the price, just want somewhere to spend our bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:40:40
yes, whatever it is it should bounce back pretty quickly
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:31:02
its also the perfect way to receive political donations
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:09:18
while I agree with whats been said already, I also wonder if some of the value in altcoins is that they can be mined to buy bitcoins? essentially a cheaper way to mine bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:50:48
something like this works for me, Im not a believer in hodl, I would sell when its under that moving average, in this case it wouldnt have resulted in much extra profit but its safer
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:25:49
it is a bit bubbly and could drop, I would doubt past 2000 and if it does it will soon be on the rise again. personally Im holding. I would sell some but dealing with exchanges and bank limits and IDs etc I cant be bothered, thats why bitcoin will succeed in the long run, its so much more convenient then fiat. if it crashes or if this bubble continues (and it could continue to 50000 based on the 2011 and 2013 bubbles altho I think its much less volatile these days so thats unlikely but a 10000 peak would not be surprising) either way Im sure it will have a base value of at least 10000 within 2 years so Im not too worried
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:49:21
Im not an alien but I think they got this
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:53:48
Im not really seeing it. yes it is bubbling, at about the same rate as it did in May, and at about 1/10 the rate of 2011 and 1013, yes there are bound to be corrections but Im not seeing any reason for special pep talks, whats happening now is pretty normal for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:00:40
yes, altho the market was much smaller and less stable then, but you are right, in fact it rallied like this through May and their was no big crash, as mentioned, use  a log scale. in any case, its ath. nobody who bought in at any time in the history of bitcoin  has lost out yet
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:31:11
no exponential growth goes on forever but its not likely to come to a sudden ending either
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:39:55
I first heard about it when it was worth 70c and instantly knew it was the future of money. Unless the world turns into a completely repressed police state I dont see how it can be stopped. Im actually surprised at how little effort governments and banks have put into repressing it and in many cases have even encouraged it..
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:24:15
unfortunately thats the way it will go. if they know you have a wallet you will have the choice of the private keys or prison. so hide your wallets
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:46:09
I agree, also Im not sure the argument that its only used as speculation is particularly sound. sure a lot gets exchanged on the exchanges but where are the figures on how much gets used for currency? the people making that argument are just guessing, as far as I know
@_date: 2018-06-05 17:32:04
a manipulative whale
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:26:18
doesnt the same apply when you bank fiat? I dont see the problem. I personally wouldnt keep btc in a bank but I can see it becoming part of the adoption process
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:53:59
$100 worth of bitcoin is the same price as $100 worth of a cheaper coin, so you dont gain anything by using a cheaper coin
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:41:47
I would say yes, but theres probably no rush, the price could drop a little more over the next few months, but still I dont think now is a bad time to buy
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:13:24
no its ok but thanks for the offer
@_date: 2018-06-18 08:35:03
just pay $1 then
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:15:30
in what way?
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:06:27
if you had invested the same amount in both you would have made 5x as much from your investment in btc
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:27:03
I got a feeling the banks are going to be co-opting it, they dont have a choice, which is fine by me and cant be stopped in any case, but, the service wont be free of course
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:06:16
how? as I said its anonomous. but sure its use is small, but not non existent. the argument its used for speculation and not as a currency is flawed, speculation is buying and selling fiat, its over a billion dollars a day and the reason for it is that its a great currency to buy and sell with, in this case buying and selling fiat. so theres a billion dollars a day worth for you
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:52:04
I see no reason to think it wont, yet, but anything could happen
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:28:39
I agree with your first paragraph but the second, I cant see the start of this conversation but I dont recall mentioning marketcap, and Im not too sure what the point you are trying to make is? 
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:19:34
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:07:35
I think if quantum computing gets to that stage they will go for the banks first. It will make fiat worthless as well as cryptos
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:51:28
could get confusing if you want to change wallets
@_date: 2018-06-10 15:07:02
I agree, lots of talk here that is anti analysis, how can you invest in anything with out analysis? sure its partly gambling but many games are a combination of gambling and skill, and you win by playing a lot of games. you cant predict the price of btc but looking at a long term log chart its a no brainer to me
@_date: 2018-06-28 08:54:17
you have o to lose
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:32:22
yes, I agree, its only value is as a currency, the same as the paper we use now. zero at any time? I sure wouldnt want to risk betting any bitcoins on that, but yes, the same as the paper we use now
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:43:19
I would rather they gave me their marijuana plants, and their bitcoins, but thats just a personal preference
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:37:18
looks fine to me. just look at a long term log chart. the bubble is over but its still a little on the high side. I dont see anything out of the ordinary. probably stay around the 5000-6000 level for a few months yet.
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:42:37
thats true, but you can compare the whole history of bitcoin to gold if you want, I just used the last year as an example
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:49:14
I think you will find that it is used as a store of value in much of asia and there are a lot of people there, but thats not to say they wont prefer btc when they discover it
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:10:58
do you have figures to back up that no one uses it as currency? but yes, not a lot of people compared to fiat, change doesnt happen overnight
@_date: 2018-06-04 19:39:40
I think BTC is very user friendly, thats why I prefer it, but its always difficult to get people to try new things. Unless theres money in it for them. offer to pay them in BTC
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:02:11
of course, but bitcoin cuts out quite a few of those costs
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:02:33
bitcoins practical value is that its an extremely good currency. humans use currencies, a lot
@_date: 2018-06-28 15:33:19
bitcoin actually has, or so far has, a very solid base line that grows at an exponential rate. if you buy in during a bubble you might have to wait a few years to start making a profit, but long term you cant go wrong
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:51:54
wheres your figures? see the thing is no one knows because bitcoin is mostly anonymous. we know a lot is traded on the markets because its public information, but there are just as many off market transactions taking place that we dont have any info on, so we have no idea how much is used to send money between countries, or even in the drug markets, but they account for at least a billion dollars worth a day. also I live in a uneducated third world country, Im sure in western countries I could buy a lot more with bitcoin. but you cant expect people to just start using it overnight. but, having said that, all my fiat is bought with bitcoin, I live off bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:31:43
I dont really know, I guess its tradition, but they seem to buy and sell them for whatever the price of gold is, less the shops commission I guess. probably more commonly pawned, If you ever want to make money in asia open a pawn shop
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:35:16
sure it can always be improved, but I think most of your fears are exaggerated, for example a long address is no inconvenience to anyone that knows how to copy and paste, or better still use a barcode scanner, and lets face it, standard bank accounts have long addresses already

@_date: 2018-06-26 19:26:58
well I do and others posting here do, but its not really possible because most of the places I buy from havent even heard of it yet, let alone considered implementing it
@_date: 2018-06-28 15:28:23
they arent free, you pay somehow, or somebody did. yearly bank fees or maybe its subsidized by people doing larger transfers, whatever, it involved electricity, computers, staff, building rents etc and they were all paid somehow
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:25:39
just answering your questions, Im not sure what the point you are trying to make is
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:41:09
but more importantly and why it will succeed, the perfect currency. at least the best so far
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:12:51
there is some truth in that but thats a long way off, theres no sign of btc slowing down yet
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:54:22
a lot of people Im talking to like gold, its been around a long time and will work if the electricity goes out. well stone age tools were round a long time too and Im sure there will be greater concerns if the power goes out, and golds harder to convert to fiat then cryptos even tho they say cryptos have no real value, but whats funnier is bitcoin is still up 5x on gold in the last year alone. but they feel secure and feel the need to post their views on gold on crypto forums for some reason
@_date: 2018-06-19 02:56:03
yeah, its unreadable, too many kids in their mothers basement that think they are going to be comedians when they grow up

for a new technology bitcoin is actually quite old, 8 years or so
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:56:38
yes I agree with that example, but its very simplistic example and if you look at more complex things, like population growth or, more related to bitcoin, internet growth, they more often then not gradually slow down and then retreat, rather then just stop or crash without warning, altho it is possible.
@_date: 2019-02-23 13:11:24
I would assume that if you just move it to another wallet it cant be proven to be yours. that wont prevent the assumption that it still yours but I dont think it can be legally proven without other evidence
@_date: 2019-02-12 15:17:33
you could get some estimate by using graphs but unless you can program your own I cant find any on the internet that will do it.  all I can say is not within the next 8 years and probably more like 15 years, if at all

I guess its possible but I dont see it going above $100,000 in the next 5 years or so, but as others have said, depends on what the dollar does as much as what bitcoin does
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:51:09
lived there 15 years and dont agree with any of what you said. for a start they are probably the wealthiest monarchy on the planet. but we can only guess because they are not accountable to anybody. and of course the king is a great guy and the monarchy is wonderful because if you live in thailand you will go to jail or disappear if you express a view that differs from that. I wonder why they need laws to make sure nobody ever criticizes them? they run the place like its a dictatorship, no matter how its romanticized. and of course, the people are too stupid to be allowed to have a democracy according to the monarchy. thats a bit of a worry too

my mistake, good chart, its what I use, but I dont think it likely the price leaves that base line till after the halving. but who knows?
@_date: 2019-02-21 10:50:24
as a holder the most likely scenario I see is for the price to rise steadily to about 7000 by the end of the year

I think most people will find they are privacy nuts when it comes to money. Asking someone how much they earn or have in the bank is not really socially acceptable. Im seeing bitcoins transparency as a weakness in the long term but I hope to be convinced otherwise.

bitcoin will be unstable for a long time yet because of its relatively tiny market cap, its like a leaf in the wind, you cant expect it to be stable at this stage of its development
having said that, if you look at its long term base line its actually surprisingly stable and predictable

theres bots for sure, I dont know how they do it but it works very well, I wish I knew cos I would do it myself
@_date: 2018-07-05 22:26:05
thats true, and they are
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:15:45
who wouldnt?
@_date: 2018-07-05 11:21:25
thats true, and none of the 3 bounces have gotten thru around 5800 so far, I wouldnt be surprised if it never does

exactly, otherwise game over, not just for the losers but the winners, which in reality is revolution
the problem is not so much that poor people vote against their own interests, but that wealthy people out of greed and stupidity vote and work against their own long term interests as well

Im no expert but I guess you can copy and paste, or use an on screen keyboard
edit: copy and paste not a good idea. I suggest using electrum on tails. that way you know there is no keylogger installed on your software, and unless someone has had access to your keyboard you should be fine, as far as I know

you cant assume but no sign of the trend ending yet

its just a normal btc bubble, not from the rise in the last 2 years, from the rise since the end of march, and its now dropped to exactly the level it always does. its impossible to predict when a bubble will burst but the level it drops back to is always the same.

I doubt alphabay had a huge effect, I agree the darkmarkets are a very important part of the bitcoin economy but other markets have most likely already picked up the slack

I like the log chart on moonmath.win

be nice if the price started going up again, in the meantime, I havent yet had to come out of the early retirement that the invention of bitcoins provided me

hate to recommend it but facebook. I could probably put you in touch with sellers in phnom penh if you pm me.
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:44:07
by my calculation hodlers are all that is left, the bears have run out of btc to sell now
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:51:14
doesnt look like it dying to me

bitcoin gets less volatile and will continue to do so as the market cap grows
