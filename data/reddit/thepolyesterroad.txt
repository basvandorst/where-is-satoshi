AutoVPS is operated by MagicalTux aka Mark Karpeles aka the same mothergoxer who's in charge of Mt. Gox. I was Goxed by AutoVPS when their site "forgot" my username just after I paid for a server. Naturally, the Goxmeister refused to fix the problem or refund my money.
Fortunately, there are [other VPS companies]( that accept Bitcoin and aren't Mt. Gox.

Tell that to Strike::Sapphire and other casinos. They *have* to hold at least some Bitcoins so that gamblers can withdraw winnings. They reported that all their profits from their first week of operation were *destroyed* by Bitcoin dropping in value. If Bitcoins fall all the way to 10 cents like you want them to, the only casinos that will remain are the ones that are *hobbies*, rather than *businesses*.
Maybe what you mean to say is that we should help the currency evolve by making more *hobbies*.

Why bother? Because it would shut these stupid retards up, that's why.

Only problem is, none of them give a shit about Open Transactions. You'll have to settle for someone like Bruce Wagner.

You could argue that businesses should never *accept* Bitcoin in the first place, and therefore Bitcoin will be in "the bubble" as long as it's more than worthless.

That list is tiny compared with the list of things you can buy with actual money, and most of those merchants also accept good old Dollars, because that's what all but 1 or 2 of their customers pay with. 
There isn't anything on that list that you can't buy with real money, thus no reason for me or anyone else to buy Bitcoins in order to get it.
OTOH, if you actually *want* to work for online Monopoly money, more power to ya (I only work for *real* money, BTW).
My suggestion of giving wetbacks no choice but to work for Bitcoins instead of money makes a lot of sense, and would delay or maybe even prevent the impending death of the Bitcoin economy (at the expense of those poor spics, who would have to buy all their food from BitMunchies), because it would create actual demand for products sold for Bitcoins, which is something that doesn't exist now.
I have a secondary suggestion: BitMunchies should be translated into Spanish, so it can tap into the emerging trapped illegal immigrant market.

Most people *wouldn't* want to get paid in BTC, because it's getting worthless, and you can't buy anything with it. However, if you're a farmer, you can make your illegal immigrants work for BTC. If they don't like it, you can tell them "chinga tu madre" and they can go back to Mexico courtesy of the INS. Then there'd actually be a market for merchants to sell into, and those merchants could extract fabulously inflated prices.

True that. Bitcoin at $0.0 will be perfectly stable.

What you're saying is it would be good for Bitcoin if casinos and other businesses would shut down and wait for the price to bottom out at 10 cents before opening again, since they couldn't actually operate without a positive balance in Bitcoins. If it's a stupid idea to hold Bitcoins (and I agree with you that it is), then the only sensible move is to not do business in them, period.
That implies that the millions of dollars that have been invested so far in setting up Bitcoin businesses have been wasted, because the proprietors of those businesses should have waited for the price to crash.
Bitcoin was an interesting idea, but it's finished now. At least the speculators are losing money. That's what really matters.
