I see you learned a good lesson.

That's what happens when you try to day trade crypto: you get regret on all cases whether you gain or loose.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:31:03
Even if they pay you are loosing time waiting for refund.

He doesn't have to pay fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:26:12
Together with fees. Unless there is a solution for fees and not the one that changes its core idea bitcoin is not fiat replacement.

As history showed it will get back 86%, which is ~3000 USD. Buy when it hits it.

Coinbase is the shovel seller in a gold rush. They don't care about gold, they care about selling shovels.

Andreas always says blockchain currencies are the future. 
Andreas never says bitcoin is the future. 
Bitcoin can be MySpace of currencies so it is advisable to invest in altcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:04:51
He is downward spiral. I worry he may commit suicide.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:01:30
If you could travel back in time you wouldn't need any bitcoin. 
Don't think about past look into the future.

Investment is money ready to be lost. This guy just gambled and went all-in.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:22:04
3000 is the new minimum.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:52:14
It will crush to  ~3000 USD, historical equivalent of 86% drop. Buy it at 3000.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:55:51
Bitcoin can be a Napster of 1992.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:34:05
Going all in if hits 2k.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:57:36
So, you are using gold to pay for groceries?

He is playing with fire. He hopes it will bring in more money as it happened with world of tanks but he still doesn't know the depth of pond he jumped in.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:29:23
Unless it drops below 800 USD  this is not drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:36:50
Wait till ~3000, cause this is 86% dip from 20,000.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:58:27
You can install a wallet on you phone,  back up keys to paper, keep several copies in secure place, maybe bank and uninstall the wallet. You can restore the wallet after HODL :-)
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:01:45
If you can go back in time you don't need any bitcoins. Even no fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:03:00
There will no be any governments by then.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:42:51
You a're just stupid and no bitcoin will help you. You ruined your family, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:54
During a gold rush most money is made by showel seller, not gold digger.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:56:11
Apple issuing its own digital currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:19:41
Just like fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:18:16
Well, no one promised us bitcoin will be the change. It can be litecoin, ether or one of bitcoin forks.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:59:04
They should get their priorities right first. Investing in bitcoin is like gambling, this is the money you are ready to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:13:40
Be ready to loose it. Emotionally prepare yourdefl.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:30:30
Well, you bought at 6,000. Sold at 14,000. 8,000 profit. If you buy now at 15,000 you have 7,000 profit. 
Buy and HODL.

@_date: 2017-12-18 05:54:23
You are not going a long way with that attitude, son. First dip will devastate you. This is related not to bitcoin only.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:31:41
It's a gamble. Chances are higher than casino but still a gamble. This is not investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:17:26
As technological innovation acclelerates bitcoin can be shortest innovation ever used by humanity. How long people have used stone, bronze, radio, VHS, vinyl, diesel engines? 
Many societies have jumped from no electricity straight to smartphones. 
Artificial Intelligence, Quantum computing, general technological innovation can disrupt our societies and make bitcoin obsolete. 
Bitcoin can be a bronze in the Stone age but we don't use bronze anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:41:35
All issues will push speculators out of bitcoin  and we will have a chance to buy it at 800usd again.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:44:48
You are a boy.
