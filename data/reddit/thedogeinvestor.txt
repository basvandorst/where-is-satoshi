It does for many types of accounts. Some banks waive fees if your account reaches a certain amount of money. But are you trying to defend bank fees? $5 for cash advance, $1 for email transfer... $15 a month for a chequing account under $5000... yea the bank imposes fees these types of fees, ESPECIALLY on customers with small accounts... The type of people who cant afford it

Short sighted was the wrong word to use. But I don't see how having a position in a few promising Alt-coins can damage another coin. Unless I were to dump mind coins for another coin but I wouldn't do that, and I don't have enough coin to affect these widely traded coins. And consumers should just try to give good feed back and devs will take care of the rest. already bounties are up to make better software for everyone

Lol didn't mean to come across like that. Let me elaborate, even something as decentralized and community based as bitcoin can be subject to such things. The things that makes it worse is no one now a days becomes a whistle-blower(only the brave). Also no one want to look like a conspiracy nut and threaten the status quo , even in bitcoin this is true.

I said no stupid fees, like for just hold money in an account. And the fees are tiny

I'm going to buy $100 of BTC ever month indefinitely. Its for retirement

Bitcoin will go to the moon in time ;) All we need is a killer app or service that makes more of an incentive to buy. But remember Bitcoin has only started to get mainstream, a lot of thing can happen.

This company is not good don't do bussiness. They screwed me out of 10grand... I don' think I will be getting that back.

I bought into both, also other crypto-coins. There is much value here and this is all just pioneering beta stuff we are seeing now. The real exciting stuff has yet to come

I don't get it, care to elaborate? Because clearly you must have some insight.

Way too fast if you ask me. I honestly feel like this whole Bitcoin thing is a roller-coaster

BTC has a very small piece of the total global transactions. It will only go up because it makes sense to use BTC because you save a lot of money. No stupid fees, complete control over your money. Inflation rate is very small and set in code. You have no idea how much money will be printed tomorrow. But with BTC we know. Bitcoin is faith in machine and dollars is faith in man. I trust the open source community more than ben bernanke

Trolololol u so funny

Whoa because of my self interest I'm hurting bitcoin... When in reality I buy bitcoins and promote it to the people I know. Great logic there, you seem to be concerned a lot about the current price. Just sell and hold fiat then. The BTC ball is rolling and more goods and service are going to be available in the future.

It's very possible, I wouldn't doubt it. Bitcoin world is full of conspiracies and conspirators unfortunately.
@_date: 2014-03-22 04:12:42
Thats a short sighted mindset, I don't have enough funds to affect the market that much. I'm in it for the long run. Bitcoin is ultimately about full control over your money and freedom. With freedom comes some dangers but that's where the fun is.

I don't see how that's the case, for every buyer there's a seller. And for the record I actually mined most my Alt-coins and bought most of my bitcoins. And all when people dump massive amounts of coins it creates arbitrage opportunity

Good, I can't wait

In the log you should have the day the keys were created.  
You need to create a support ticket.  
Considering the API keys never had permission to withdraw  they should refund.
