Rest of the story is bullshit, but what's wrong with paying your fair share of taxes on your income?

You don't benefit from any public services/utilities/infrastructure while you live there?

My government healthcare would beg to differ.

I bought a used XFX 5870 (Reference version) for only $150 cash and am getting 410 MHash/sec overclocked with the Phoenix miner.

I just hopped on with ~650MHash/sec. Let's get a block! Are there any fees on the server?

The bitcoin program will always be using the CPU as far as I know. You want to download [this program]( to use the GPU. You can use the command line as well if you're in to that kind of thing, but I just use the gui version. I'd suggest joining the "slush" bitcoin pool, it seems to be working much better than bitcoinpool for me (I made about 35 cents in the last 24 hours with an old shitty 8800gt, an HD 6850 should technically make ~10x that).

I have a 5870 (Picked it up used for $150, about 400-410 MHash/sec) and a 5830 ($110 after a MIR, about 260-280 MHash/sec) in the same rig. Nothing really too fancy, I bought them about a month ago in hopes to pay themselves off as a rig upgrade, seems to have worked out quite well with bitcoin exhange rates like they are recently!
I actually switched back to my regular pool until some of issues with the pool get figured out but they seem to pretty much have been fixed...

Exactly, and it seems the exchange prices seem to follow difficulty to some extent, so that further extends the life.

Used off Kijiji (think Craigslist for Canada). It was an XFX so it came with warranty too!
