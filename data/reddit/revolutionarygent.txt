It could essentially be the same as selling stock, which boosts the capacity of companies without creating debt. Those coins could be traded for other crypto like Bitcoin to create a liquid market without all the barriers Wall St throws up to cash in being the middle men. Problem so far with ICOs is the dominance of scammer without a successful business or innovation selling coins to suckers wanting to get rich quick.

He's so clear headed when he lays out the case for more inflation. Inflation boosts both but you can tell he has an irrational fear of bitcoin. When he joins in we'll know the bubble is real!

On JRE podcast he lays out the reasons why the Fed can never raise interest rates (debt service alone become major budget item) then turns the logic around to say bitcoin is nothing and we have to go back to a gold standard. Making one dollar worth an ounce of gold is the surest way to guarantee the debt is never reduced.

The point is to make it colloquial. Anything with Greek prefixes or micro- is not easily understandable. 
Is it too intimidating to use bits (1/1,000,000)? I bought this toaster for 2000 bits, honey!

Not to mention his advocacy of a return to the gold standard which would hopelessly bury everyone holding debt, from the government down. Inflation is here to stay and so is bitcoin.

I find the "First 50" to be the most difficult on the commercial side. Customers would follow the merchant's lead if there were incentives. The block is in the knowledge base of the store owner. 
How do you tell the owner the value added by bitcoin when he doesn't consider bitcoin a form of payment in the first place?

No ENE chart 1994-2002??

That is supposed to be true, but with the IRS you are guilty until you prove yourself innocent.

I keep watching and thinking what price would make the 10k-20k spike look like one of those little bumps?

Coinbase fought for average users when the IRS was tryin to get all the trading records since 2013 to justify sticking their nose into legitimate transaction, for that they have my business. The competition is catching up so I hope they continue the sector leadership

Why does everyone pitching DCA sound like a cross between “subscribe to my newsletter” and a guy pleading with you to smell his fingers behind the dumpster?
Stop selling so hard and just HODL

Coming from the kid that doesn’t know what a pun is, I take it you stop for a whiff of any fingers extended? You’re the only one talking about investment strategies ahaha I can tell I’m already wasting my time though ;)

Up vote for interesting rabbit hole but appreciate the irony of a three month old account posting about someone buying old accounts to spam. 
This isn't helping:

Copy/paste spam is not helping your case

Inflation (and deflation) is always and everywhere a *monetary* phenomenon.  
What good reason is there for central banks to continue emergency-level monetary policy?
