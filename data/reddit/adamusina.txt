I think I could do it for $3,000 to $6,000 as a voluntary effort (depending on how long it will take 1 or 6 months to develop). $1,000 per month is more than enough to cover living costs and dedicating myself full time to a Bitcoin project.
I believe making localbitcoins open-source, would be a great deal of increasing decentralization &amp; liquidity for Bitcoins. I am a PHP programmer from Russia.

I am using LocalBitcoins in Russia all the time, because its the most efficient way to buy/sell Bitcoins.
But there's a drawback: LocalBitcoins has custodial access to your Bitcoins because that's the way their software functioning - they need custodial access to provide you their escrow services.
But inspite of that this service is awesome when transferring such small amounts as 2 bitcoins, but never release Bitcoins unless you're not sure your fiat transaction is finalized &amp; don't forget to withdraw your Bitcoins from their custodial storage back to your wallet once youv'e used their exchange serviec.

You can't use Bitcoin on any smartphone in my country.
Today Bitcoin still struggling with App Store. I mean it haven't made it to the App Store yet for my country, here's why:
Breadwallet is a very bad choice, since it has 0 language support, while mycellium is available almost in every langauge. Stop seeing only your country and stop forcing everyone study English (which is **x2 times** harder while you're being forced to study a **cryptocurrency**), when choosing better wallets, consider if they have localization, otherwise it is horrible, **very insecure** wallet.
Most of people here in developing (poor countries are main audience for Bitcoin) countries are iPhone 4/iPhone 4S users. Its almost impossible to afford iPhone 5 or iPhone 5S for anyone else here, so the stats in most developing countries. Still fucking Mycellium is not supported for the most phones iPhone 4 and 4S. So up to the day I don't know any good recommended wallet for iPhone. I'm experiencing this problems just, because there's too much iPhone 4/4S users in my area, and I'm really active at recommending Bitcoin, but very often its just becomes impossible to recommend somebody Bitcoin, when there's even no wallets for iPhone... :(

Okay, correct spelling is: 95% of people won't use any software (especially currency-related software) if it doesn't have **localized** interface into their language.
I do love English myself, but somebody speaks Arabic, someone speaks Mandarin, and there's a whole world of people who *simply don't know English*.
95% of this people won't use Bitcoin under any circumstances if its not on their language.

The problem is not with OS. Most of people who have legacy devices already upgraded to iOS 7, latest operating system from Apple, but MyCellium doesn't even work on such devices, because probably there's screen resolution compatibility, what a lame excuse.

- Blockchain.info is the only wallet that has Russian interface. But takes few hours of my efforts to make it work on iPhone 4/4S (How you expect doing all these actions from the person who don't know how to use Bitcoin). Anyone I tried to promote Bitcoin with it, is bored already on 20th minute of this process. And that is including that I've trained at flawless installation at home. It works perfectly at home. Meets many glitches &amp; problems on the phones of people who wish to try Bitcoin apps on their phone. Everything from buttons not working, app being shutdown on the middle of process (app stability issue on older platforms). Problems with exporting existing private keys. There's not a 1 problem, there's a many problems with this wallet.
- Mycellium. Doesn't works on iPhone 4/4S at all.
- Breadwallet. No localization
- All the other wallets I tried has no localization at all. 95% of people won't use any software (especially currency) if it doesn't have Russian interface, forget it.

This is ridiculous advice. Not everyone should be a programmer. While yes, I agree, increasing overall amount of programmers is generally a good thing.
If you would recommended me to learn translation process into my native language and process of volunteering my translations on GitHub, that would be more reachable goal, but you haven't recommended me that. I know that I can do it. Actually this is already my plan. But not now, because now I'm here to rant.

Okay, you can read it as BITCOIN IS NOT AVAILABLE ON SMARTPHONES


How Bitcoin can work with 0 users? (Okay sorry with 0.1% users)


Thanks for sharing!
These stats are showing that iPhones in 2015 went up in quantities. I don't want to argue with stats, but there's some feeling, that something's wrong with this stats, I believe that this stats are mostly suitable for U.S./Europe. Yeah it says world, but maybe somehow we (in developing countries) bought out all iPhones you have on eBay listings internationally dark market way.
Yes, Android is the king. But why everyone I see on the streets, most friends I know, most people I meet are using iPhone? Its like 90% of cases I meet them. I believe something is rigged here
But don't focus on my last sentences. Even if its only 20%, my main issue is most people I know are using these outdated iPhones and there's really narrow options :( I really getting stuck at recommending them at least 1 viable option. This is really frustrating...
@_date: 2015-07-19 23:59:04
I tried to make my point very argumented. Why you don't think that its a huge problem for Bitcoin?
Seems like the only option you can recommend me is not counting anything bellow iPhone 5. Are you really suggesting closing eyes &amp; ignoring this stuff?

Also I found out that most people here can't even code few lines in any programming languages, and don't have guts to learn even 1 api. But they think that programming is easy. 
And they already know that your project is bad, because it has no multisig. And that we (developers) must try harder.
But truth is that they are not interested in products which is not attractive in marketing perspective. They love new things happening in Bitcoin industry, because they are shiny &amp; well-marketed &amp; millions of dollars pumped. But not some ugly new p2p exchange for Africa that even has no multisig.

Unregulated in a sense that nobody usually blocks your accounts. I'm pretty sure that 4 of mentioned systems freezing account million times less than it happens within networks like Visa/MasterCard.
If you think of account freezing as of some sort of deadly accident (like a car accident). Then financial system of U.S. can be described as cars, because of huge amounts of accidents, fraud cases, cases when someone frozen someone's account.
Nothing like that ever happens to regular Russian accounts. In April 2015 (I know what I'm talking about today), you still can use QIWI **anonymously**!!! You will never believe me, but you should trust me - its anonymous! Nobody force you to reveal your data, and those systems doesn't even have any way to identify you!
So that's why the only thing which comes to mind when I describe KYC practices in our country in that accident comparison - is that your capital is FREE in Russia. And the amount of bans/blocks/freezing of accounts in mentioned above systems are very close to **0** (zero). So that's why in terms of accidents I would compare Russia to airplanes, there more chance that car will hit you on the street, than you're going to crush in the airplane.
So the same thing with WebMoney/Yandex/Sber/QIWI. No one is going to freeze your account.
P.S. For the last 10 years I did thousands of transactions using all of those systems, and I know what I'm talking about. For the whole life of using these systems I am and my friends faced any problems with withdrawals/frozen accounts only 2 times (I know its not compares to Bitcoin, but you can't compare it with U.S. high fraud rates either) - and even in those 2 times our money was "unfrozen" over the phone after few days of calling to tech support. So I never ever seen anyone losing money with those systems.
By fraud I mean not regular fraud cases with citizens/companies robbing other citizens. By fraud I mean companies blocking accounts.

Where is our Russian WatchMyBit?
Where is the innovation on our last mile? (Bitcoin through QIWI/SBERBANK/YM/WM?!)
I'm ready to share all the API for QIWI/SBERBANK/YM/WM &amp; many other Russian coders will be able to help you with that. All of these systems don't regulate your payments, and all of them are instant and have open APIs!

I will help creating any Bitcoin service for you. Absolutely FREE of chrage. Just offer me an idea, I will create a web-service just for you. Also I can teach you technical basics of accepting Bitcoin on your web-site.
@_date: 2015-04-09 18:59:22
Additionally I can add up that there's a fragmentation - very rarely you can conveniently transfer your money from yandex.money to qiwi, or from qiwi to sberbank.online. These kind of features aren't working because these currencies are competing with each other. But I just wanted to emphasize, that you could do microtransactions with all of these systems! Its huge opportunity!
IF users would benefit from these microtransaction abilities, why we as Bitcoin movement shouldn't be happy about this? I don't feel like Qiwi/Sber/YM/WM are any competition to Bitcoin. You're living abroad &amp; maybe that's why you're jealous. But you just have to deal with the fact that most Russians won't understand Bitcoin, only because there's already platfroms for that &amp; for this...
I feel like Qiwi/Sber/YM/WM are very good friends to Bitcoin. These 4 payment systems are our Russian paradigms, which we proudly can oppose versus Visa/MasterCard cartel. I wouldn't want the whole country to lose the ability to send funds directly through these systems in an irreversible manner. And while there is such opportunity, how you still aren't glad that such an enormous business is presented for the any global audience? Before &amp; before I've learned this I had no chance to speak about this &amp; no cause to emphasize the importance of this stuff. So I hope you're listening: microtransactions are allowed &amp; you can offer various types of autonomous services. E.g. scripts like this  - this guys gave me really wonderful idea - many Russian YouTube vloggers, content makers &amp; other ones who's having YouTube channels - they would be happy to receive more ability to monetize their content. Huge Russian channels like *crazymegahell* along with others are still putting some shitty advertising at the end of their videos, and that's the only idea they have come  up with their additional revenue monetization model?! Come on! Now that's ridiculous.

The story of this movie is described here:  (use Google Translator because the page is in Russian) 
In my own words: (I'm not associated with them anyhow, just independently found &amp; translated their trailer - my channel is  the biggest official Russian TV channel allocated huge budget for producing this movie.
But someone from the power structures gave the order to stop the production and confiscate and destroy all the footage which being taken. The management of TV channel has been given order to destroy it, but all the people who were filming were against destroying their job, that's why they had to pay bounty to the management to keep the right for intellectual property and the right to make this movie public. This was a bargain with the devil, which meant that all the team who were producing this movie for many months had to give up their salaries to buy rights to this movie to showcast this independently and without that official channel's watermark in the corner. 
This is one of the most promising events for a Russian community. Highly discussed in a threads on (this subreddit is international and needs your participation and support too)
The official page says that movie producers can include name in to cast if donation is more than 0.25 btc
@_date: 2015-09-27 03:44:32
Just thought that it could be nice to show the idea why privacy is good, also this movie mentioned Bitcoin, but they are mentioned it as some company, lol that's why it wasn't a good idea to crop it either. But the whole movie is awesome because it acknowledges with concept that there's alternative systems are available.
This is not only about TOR's privacy. Its about the whole government censorship, rules.
Currently many of my friends don't understand why you have to care about privacy. Yeah this is all about information and a bit offtopic, but at least it is not altcoins, just philosophy.

So if I follow the logic of the analogy, the people who demand the passenger's weight to be measured before they step on to the train are the miners, correct?
In another word, for the artificial limit to be removed, it must start with miners who are willing to adopt the program.
Okay, but here's my question. What will happen when some miners adopt that program, while other miners have not? Does this mean that there would be a period when some blocks would still have that artificial limit, while not for others? 
If Alice is trying to transfer a unit of BTC smaller than a satoshi to Bob, but the miner has not adopt the new program, how is the miner able to do proof of work for something that his/her program is not made to verify?
From the perspective of non-newbie hobbyist, I do think there is a better way to explain this, but I'll let it wait for your response.

Bitcoin is not Tor, but to defend the purpose of the post I think its all about philosophy, and also it mentions some technical information about Chinese controls, e.g. I knew that China has firewall, but I didn't knew that it so severe that you can't even use such applications as tor. That let's to see big picture about connectivity, including it can make someone think how Chinese wall will affect Bitcoin's connectivity.
Also both tor and Bitcoin are work under the same problem - avoiding censorship and surveillance.
