Oh, what's in a name anyway. But that is cool,  I didn't know that. Thanks for sharing.

I'm a farmer. Always have been, always will be. Nature shouldn't be left unattended.

I don't understand. Crypto seems to have so many weird anomalies. Is this common with other kinds of trading?

It is not invariant. When discovering the identity of the creator of a set of rules then you must learn to see certain things from many different angles. Bitcoin is about a way of governing social behaviors in a way that is opposite to current: patriarchal hierarchy. It is a model of the way we believe in the transfer of value. 
It is important to understand the difference because it helps to know what you might be investing in. After all, a person would be invested if they understood its true meaning because true meaning has true value. That's why a coin that has no country can be worth so much relative to an army backed dollar. Some would call that  an idea with value.

I'm sure lots of people do. It was a brilliantly executed idea.

Thanks! I guess this would mean that it can be manipulated easily? i.e.: the general public doesn't have enough cash to push this thing wildly in any direction.

You betcha.

It's too close NOT to visit. Plus it's sort of always there. It's hard to forget.

Heheh. People who don't understand the relevance of labels end up with strange ideas, like every idea is the same. That's nihilism. Labels are what tell us things are different...so we can understand them differently.
