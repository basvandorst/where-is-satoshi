some banks don't have physical branches. and someone hijacking your identity on the phone is not that difficult. actually, even going into a branch and running into a teller is a little harder, but not impossible.

it's not money if you can't use it to many things

Um yeah, but there are forex fees for bitcoin in/out. so no.

I believe in bitcoin's future and it's value as much as you do. I also hold BTC in a hardware wallet. That being said, I disagree with your perspective of using and sending bitcoin. In the future, it might be more useful; however, it's not the case now. I trust you word in that 2nd layers and sidechains (which to be honest, I have to read up on) may help, but that's not my point. Gold is also irrelevant to this discussion. 
My example is this: if someone needs to pay a medical bill, taxes, rent/mortgage payment, and other things you don't 'buy', most companies and people do not take bitcoin. To my knowledge, if you are sending bitcoin to someone abroad for these purposes (a chunk offshore remittances are for these purposes, FYI), they have to convert it to local fiat. Period. I don't think there's any way around it. The spread between buy/sell is already pretty high with most exchanges, and hassle is magnified AYC/KML, especially if a decentralized exchange like Bisq. does not have a presence in their home country (or there are not enough trading pairs/partners).
If I have friends and family that need to receive the equivalent of 100-1000+ USD in local currency abroad, it's cheaper through conventional non-bank means like Transferwise, Norbert's Gambit, etc. You are just making so many inaccuracies that it's confusing. Traditional wires internationally are made with SWIFT. There are no Chinese characters involved whether you're sending funds to China or a non-Chinese Asian country.

Is it automatic DCA?
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:06:25
yeah that means i have to do things!

you're generally not sending money abroad for people to store; you're sending money for them to use. otherwise, why send it?

I don't understand. If your income is earned in ARS, and there are now capital controls implemented; that means you can't USD except on the grey/black market, right? Wouldn't access to BTC be limited by these capital controls also?

That's exactly my point. I assume Argentinian residents can still get USD (although at a slightly poorer rate) through the grey market if those still exist - but I don't know how the onramp to crypto works in Argentina. With localbitcoins (which I've never used) or P2P, the party receiving ARS and giving BTC is still stuck with capital controlled fiat - so what incentive is there to accept it because presumably the BTC sellers aren't going to want ARS now either?
