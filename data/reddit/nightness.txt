The fact that no one is frightened, is frightening. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:13:25
No, but in a year it will be. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:04:29
Watch the "1929" documentary, they all thought they were riding a wave that would never collapse as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:18:41
Not asking to be in, except for mining. But I want it to be stable, we've already had a 51% scare. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:02:06
Yeah one government could mess with my money, not 15 governments!
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:05:26
Can't trust, too much risk of this. The US could do this in a heart beat if they wanted too. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:55:10
And you even said, at this point. Which was true. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:55:53
Technology limitations is not security. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:08:00
Miners would sign their work. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:56:05
Omg the downvoting, lol. You people are stupid using highly inefficient (power wise) graphics cards, they were never designed for power efficiency. Read up on parallel computing before to talk shit you know nothing about. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:03:59
Oh have done the math. It is obtainable. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:58:38
Yes, the proposed change I'm suggesting is the pool you are in is not optional.  It would be a protocol where peers approve group transfers. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:36:53
Fuck me, I totally forgot about that type of parallel computing. It's still weird that it works. . :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:21:30
Disagree, I could do the attack, but lack the resources. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:00:32
I'm the one that designed the 100 watt, 40 TH/s device, not you. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:36:04
You are all idiots. I can do this attack with less than $50,000. The downvotes are uneducated deniers. Gee we don't have any of those people; hay Donald Trump, how was breakfast?
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:16:04
Did I mention that the 40TH/s was only 100 watts?
It costs too much to do something is not a security measure in computer science. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:17:13
Ok fine, does anyone tech savvy, want to consider investing in and building the hardware system, while work on the software?
If you have and know how to use a 3D printer for enclosure design, that would help. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:54:05
I can make it cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:29:31
Yup, parallel computing with SoC boards. That's as much as I'll say publicly. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:23:08
Socialism is an economic system, not a political system.  This is what I have to deal with, people that "jump on the ride", without having a clue what's about to happen. 
Economics need the same burden of proof science does at this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:49:36
Not going down that way, I'm not seeking glory or money (government toppling maybe). When the design is complete, it will be published and be available to everyone. Only way to stop a 51% attack is to give everyone this. 
I'm already freaking out people that know what I'm about to give away, I can't believe I'm the first to come up with this, it's so simple. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:15:59
Sorry no, that violates the no-need for trust. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:20:31
What's stopping the exploiter from being the double spender?
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:31:26
Oh yes you are. It fucken stupid that people dismiss this issue. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:51:09
Agreed it's an unlikely attack. A fix should still be designed. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:29:22
Yes and Electricity. What I said is more or less true. No idea what the end result is though. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:58:13
Yup, just informing the public 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:20:36
Great question, I'm not suggesting I have a complete solution, only that this is great way (in principle) to prevent the 51% attack. I just thought of this. I'll contribute more details as I ponder this more. 
I just wanted to get everyone here, thinking about this. Especially devs. :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:59:30
Yeah, you 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:45:25
Bad but completely reasonable idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:39:00
Omg, lmfao so loud the neighbors heard. I'm been doing programming and design for 30 years. Your misplaced confidence is wrong, not me. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:14:13
Nice, I can finally pay my student loans off. :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:41:26
Google it. The 51% attack issue is a real thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:45:15
Yeah, but stupidity is Sooooo annoying. I almost killed myself when you fuck-tards elected Trump. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:31:38
Are you ok? Seriously sounded like you had a stroke writing that. I will respond to a more articulated response. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:11:56
I've designed one, in theory. I've done the math 5 times now, it should work. 
Just wanted to know if it was worth implementing. Thanks. :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:33:15
Actually it's not both. Google it, the political system you are looking to describe is communism.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:08:22
It's not evenly.. If I can do 40000 GH/s, and you do 1 GH/s, we don't get paid the same, first dude is making 40k (times) more. It "socializing" I guess, but earn potential is **always** there. Just build more processing power. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:06:53
What did you think he was going to do? You know how many times this guy has declared bankruptcy? Of course he is going to bankrupt the nation.
I'd argue the value of bitcoin is directly proportional to how many fucked up things Donald Trump is doing.
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:43:54
You guys do realize Bitcoin is more volatile than ANY other investment? You are all essentially buying each other's hopes of being a millionaire. Its going to bubble and burst. 
I wish we treated Bitcoin as it was intended, a currency.
