Gemini. Simple as that. The fees and delays at Coinbase aren't worth your business. Gemini solves both issues perfectly.

Gemini is better than Coinbase. Faster and better customer service. Plus you can trade right away vs waiting for funds to clear.

I mean you initiate an ACH from your bank account, then you can buy BTC right after vs waiting 3 days for the transfer to finish.

They limit what you can withdraw from the site (transfer to private wallet) until it clears but it allows you to buy right away vs waiting.

If you're looking for negativity on btc, read r/ethtrader. I love both BTC and Eth and won't participate in the negativity over there buts it's definitely there.

For cryptocurrency as a whole, Epicenter.

Switch to Gemini and do their ACH which they allow you to trade with immediately. I'm newer to the scene too, started on Coinbase and will never go back after finding Gemini. Better customer service and lower fees.

I initiated a withdrawal on January 20th and got an email saying it would be complete that day. On January 23rd I contacted them on their website for more information. I received my funds on January 27th and never heard from them outside of what appears to be an automated email stating the funds were sent on the 27th. All in all it took a week for the whole process.

How long did it take to receive your funds? I'm in the same situation right now.
