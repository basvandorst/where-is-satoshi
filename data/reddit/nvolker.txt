How is that *not* immoral? If you're in a position that could possibly prevent a unjust death, the moral action would be to try and prevent that death.
I could maybe see it if there was some degree of risk to your own safety ("sell my that cyanide or I'll take it over your dead body!"), but the original example didn't elaborate on the details.
My personal take on morality is that actions that increase suffering are immoral, and actions that decrease suffering are moral. Taking an action you know will lead to the death of another is, by that (very simple) definition, immoral.

Google Wallet and Apple Pay are more analogous to Bitcoin Wallet apps. If Bitcoin starts to become more popular, there's no reason Apple and Google couldn't just add the ability to pay with Bitcoin to their apps, provided merchants had a way to accept it (unless they're under contract not to do so by Bitcoin's *real* competitors: Visa/Mastercad and the banks behind the existing plastic card payment networks)
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:29:53
Exactly. A better analogy might be like Bitcoin is to an electric vehicle charging network as Apple Pay is to a sexy new (gas powered) hybrid car.
Bitcoin wallet apps would be like all-electric cars, and the credit card networks would be like gas stations.
Consumers like Apple Pay/Hybrid Gas Cars because they can be conveniently be used with the existing infrastructure of the credit card payment networks/gas stations.

The government prevents people from being greedy by forcing everyone to pay for things that benefits the greater good, whether they want to or not.
Whether you agree with what the government decides "the greater good" is is another matter entirely. I'd much rather just pay taxes than have every road be a toll road, every school be private, be left to die if I can't pay for health insurance, donate to multiple scientific organizations, donate to charities that help low-income and homeless people become productive members of society, pay a subscription fee to law enforcement and fire departments in order to receive their protection (man, I would hate to see how the "laws" that the law enforcement in a government-less society enforces would be determined), let companies pollute the environment as much as they want (or somehow pay them not to?), etc.

Apple's rarely been first into a market, but they're often the first that creates a product that is widely successful when they enter it.

@_date: 2014-09-12 15:28:54


They payment processors (Visa, Mastercard, etc) would have to go through Apple to map the "Device Account Number" and transaction-specific dynamic security code to an actual bank account / credit card. If that's the case, that information would also probably include enough information for Apple to determine how much their cut is. If Apple's just charging a flat-rate "swipe" fee, no information about the transaction other than the fact it occurred is needed.


Yes and no. The app just does some optical character recognition to get the card number so you don't have to type it in yourself. You can use the camera to enter your credit card information into the phone, but the image is never saved to your camera roll, let alone to iCloud.


This would be incredibly difficult to do on a non-jailbroken iOS device. iOS is incredibly locked down specifically to prevent things like this (which is why Android fans talk about how much of a 'closed' platform iOS is). Passbook would need to save the image to the camera roll (which it doesn't), and the malicious app must have been installed, explicitly granted access to your photos, and then be opened or have background app refresh enabled in order to send it to their servers.


Third party keyboards in iOS cannot access the internet.


Each transaction has a transaction-specific dynamic security code.


At this point it's an argument whether Bitcoin is safer than the traditional credit card network, and has nothing to do with ApplePay.
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:04:30
It tells the payment processor to withdraw money. 
It's more secure because there's no card number or magnetic stripe that can be copied, and the phone/watch needs to be authenticated before the transaction is initiated (either via Touch ID on the iPhone 6 or via some sort of pin code on the Apple Watch). This adds the same level of security that "Chip &amp; PIN" systems have.
Also, your actual credit or debit card numbers are never shared with the merchant or transmitted with the payment, instead they send a device-specific account number and a transaction-specific dynamic security code. So if someone hacks Home Depot or Target again and leaks all those credit card numbers, yours will not be included. Apple also does not store your credit/debit card info you use with Apple Pay on their own servers, it's kept locally and securely on your device. Granted, they currently *do* have people's credit/debit card info on their servers to facilitate paying with your Apple ID in iTunes, the App Store, etc.

I agree. The IDs serve the same purpose to PayPal as private keys do to Bitcoin. You need to prove that the money is yours in order to move/spend it.

The current record for computations per second is 95 teraFLOPS per second.
To crack 256 bit AES encryption with the best known method, it takes about 2^99.5 operations (and that's for a related key attack - where the attacker knows multiple keys with some kinds of relationship are being used).
Assuming computers double in speed annually, it will be 35 years before the fastest computer system in the world can crack 256 bit AES encryption in less than a year with a related key attack, and about 45 years until an average consumer PC could do so.
To crack 256 bit AES encryption without knowing anything about the keys, the best known method takes about 2^254 operations. Again assuming that computers double in speed annually, it will be 189 years before the fastest computer in the world can break it in less than a year, and 200 years before an average computer could.
Again, those figures are assuming computers double in speed every year, which would require some major breakthroughs in tech to keep happening.

The software that manages letting you enter your passcode, and the software that decrypts your data if the passcode is correct, *has to* be allowed to run without entering your passcode. Otherwise it would be like putting a combination dial on the inside of a safe.
Since that code cannot be encrypted with the passcode, the best protection Apple can make is to have the hardware check that the software is signed by Apple's key before it runs it. The FBI can easily copy and modify the unencrypted software, but they can't run it without signing it with Apple's key.

@_date: 2016-06-03 02:11:33
Think of deflation as a greater-than-one multiplier. If you have a positive net worth, sure, that translates to an increase in purchasing power. But if you're in debt, that multiplier increases the severity of that debt. The same-sized payment of that debt takes more and more of your "purchasing power" as the value of a bitcoin increases. 
For example, imagine if someone took out a three-year 100BTC (interest free!) loan from someone back in 2013. Those first few payments would have been pretty easy (1BTC was worth around 15USD, so a monthly payment of ~2.7BTC would have been about the equivalent of 40USD). As the purchasing power of bitcoin increased, those same 2.7BTC monthly payments would be harder and harder to make.

I forget that is rampant with pseudo-libertarian/anarchistic people. I could rant about how you should feel morally obligated to chip in your fair share to the public good, but that's quite a bit of a departure from copyright, so I'll keep it short. I can understand being upset with *how much* taxes you pay, and how/where your tax dollars are being spent, but saying that you feel "no moral obligation whatsoever" to pay taxes either implies that you feel that *no* taxpayer funded programs benefit you in any way, or that you feel entitled to the benefits provided by those programs without contributing your fair share to fund them. Okay, back to copyright stuff:


I understand the distinction. I was pointing out the absurdity of your "why should I feel obligated to pay for something just because you think I should" argument. If you want a good or service, it has value to you. Other people may be willing to provide it for you based on what it is worth to *them*. You're not entitled to goods and services based on what *you* think they are worth. Creative works are no different. If the owner of a creative work is asking more for it than you are willing to spend, you are not entitled to it anyway.
Copyright laws are absurd, yes. However, the *basis* for them (that content producers deserve to be compensated for their work) is perfectly fair. Do I think it's ridiculous that I can be sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars for sharing a book published nearly 100 years ago? Yes, of course. Do I think it's unjust that you're often forced to repurchase the same creative work if you want it in a different format? Absolutely. Do I think region-restrictions are bullshit? Yup.
Does that mean I think that when someone publishes a creative work, that it should instantly fall into the public domain (where everyone is allowed to access, copy, distribute it as they see fit with no regards for it's creator)? No, of course not. Authors, Artists, Musicians, and other types of content producers deserve the right to profit from their work. Rewarding creators encourages more creative works to be made. 
Only after a certain amount of time (exactly how long is debatable, but the current "life of the author + 70 years" is ridiculous), when the encouragement that copyrights give creators wanes, does it become more valuable for the ownership of that work to be transferred to the public, where it can inspire others to create things of their own.
If you said something along the lines of "I don't feel morally obligated to pay for movies that came out 50 years ago," I would maybe understand where you were coming from, but pirating something simply because you don't want to pay for it is wrong. It's not the *worst* thing in the world, but it's along the lines of sneaking into a movie/concert/sporting event without paying.

What I got from all this is that the FBI wants Apple to build a custom version of iOS that does not penalize incorrect passcodes (so no time delay or data wipe), and to add the ability to electronically enter passcodes.
Doing that wouldn't be a backdoor into the encryption used, but rather an easy way to reduce the size of the keyspace they need to brute force.
The data on the phone is encrypted with a key built from the user's passcode, as well as a unique device ID that Apple does not keep track of that is built into the hardware (and therefore cannot be read by any software or firmware). 
Brute forcing the full key without that ID is impossible. But if you only need to brute force the PIN (by letting the OS combine the PIN and the device ID like it normally does), you now have a lot fewer possibilities. The problem is that the same code that lets the OS combine the PIN with the device ID is the code that implements an artificial time-delay after a number of failed attempts.
The FBI is probably asking Apple to build them a custom version of the OS that they can put on the device in question that bypasses the time-delay so they can just brute force the PIN instead of the full combined PIN/Device ID.

Apple Pay does not store your credit card number, not even on your phone. They store what they call a "Device Account Number" (which sounds like it's some sort of hash created from your credit card number and a device-specific ID) that can only be used with transaction-specific dynamic security codes created by the same device.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:07:36


People can use stolen credit card info to buy bitcoin too, which would have the same effect as someone using a stolen credit card added to Apple Pay. That's not an issue with Apple Pay or Bitcoin.


Apple doesn't see any part of the transaction, so you're only trusting Apple not to allow merchants to take more than you owe them. Since the transaction-specific dynamic security codes likely take into account how much the transaction is for, Apple and the merchant would have to collaborate to secretly take more than what your phone says you've authorized.


Thieves cannot use device account numbers to make transactions without being able to generate valid dynamic security codes. Although the exact components that Apple uses to generate this code aren't publicly known, the EMV Payment Spec suggests that it is made up of encrypted data sourced from the token, the device itself, and transaction data. 
In other words, you would, at the very least, need not only the token (aka device account number), but also data stored on the device that token is tied to (including the private key it uses to encrypt the dynamic security code), and knowledge of exactly how Apple's algorithm puts these components together.

The bank is expected to spend that money somehow. Say you're a plumber who borrows $10,000 from a bank, and is expected to pay back $11,000 (because of interest). Now, even if the plumber spends none of the $10,000 - he won't be able to pay the bank the amount he owes. But let's say the bank's pipes burst, and they pay the plumber $1,000 to fix it. Now the bank has given the plumber $11,000 in total, so the plumber can pay the full amount. Even if there were only $10,000 in existence, this situation would still work (as long as the pipes burst after the plumber had already paid back $1,000 of his loan)
The problem with banks isn't that they charge interest, it's that they collect more in interest than they contribute back to the economy. Money hoarding is the real problem, it's just that banks make it *really* easy for themselves to hoard money.

Exactly. Just like how Best Buy gets a cut of all the software people buy from their stores. (or should that be *used to* buy? Does anyone still buy software from brick-and-mortar stores anymore?)

Nearly every democrat has been accused of this at some point. You say entitlement programs (like social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, etc) "perpetuate the American oligarchy" and "rip apart the middle class," I say they provide necessary resources to the least fortunate to allow them to escape poverty. This has been debated to death and is one of the defining distinctions between the left and the right, and isn't unique to any politician in particular.


The official (republican-led) report on Benghazi concluded that there was no intelligence failure prior to the attack, no stand-down order to CIA operatives trying to go assist at the besieged consular building, and found conflicting intelligence in the wake of the attack about the motive and cause, which were reflected in early public comments by the administration.

And Obama's worse than Hitler, right?
