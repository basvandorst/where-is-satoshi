If they dont run their own full node and relies on third party API service providers like bitgo/blockcypher, then it is very much possible that they DO NOT hold the private key of their forwarding address.
@_date: 2018-08-20 18:35:21
If someone can run a bitcoin full node on its own, he/she can accept bitcoin as is using JSON/RPC as well. One does not need BTCPayServer to complicate things further for no extra benefit. The extra benefit comes only when BTCPayServer provides a way to convert BTC to FIAT.
@_date: 2018-08-17 18:28:32
I wish so...
@_date: 2018-08-17 17:36:19
BTCPayServer must include FIAT conversion for merchants. That's what the main plus point of BitPay. There are already many APIs that allows to accept Bitcoin as is and integration of those are easier than BTCPayServer.

Why? Its time to buy ETC... not ETH. ETC is going to hit CoinBase by the end of Sept. It is already on CoinBase Pro.

Can u please back up your figures with authentic sources?
@_date: 2018-05-30 10:26:03
Can u please back up your figures with authentic sources? AFAIK, Satoshi had the highest holding of ~1m bitcoins, which is ~5% of total supply. I think, no other individual or organization holds more than 5% of total supply.

It is not a good idea to have Bitcoin info in browser by default.

Bitcoin is not about scratching each other's back. Bitcoin has gone through many acid tests and is ready to go for more. So, expect people to be salty. This is part &amp; parcel of the bear market.

I said **1 Bitcoin, *held* since August 2017**.

I think, u dont consider bitcoin anything beyond a tradeable asset. Unfortunately, bitcoin is much more than that*. Yah, true, $120b has not been pumped into bitcoin. But, $120b does not want to go out of it either. Do u think all hodlers of Gold will find a buyer at current rate on a certain day? No. But, is Gold crashing for that? No. Same for bitcoin. The problem of bitcoin is the people hodling it without understanding the fundamentals. Fortunately, they are minority. So, even if they sell, there wont be a crash, but a correction.

When I got in @ 350, I thought that I was too late as well... :D
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:22:23
What? Gold?
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:01:42
As of yet, I dunno how to claim Gold from Bitcoin blockchain. I read, many of the wallets listed on their official website are scam to steal bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:54:46
What do u think is the average amount of money in each gram of Gold?
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:01:31
At 350 USD, u get ~50 mBTC now.

But, your country still has the highest % of bitcoin mining share as well as some of the biggest exchanges of the world. If your government did really hate bitcoin, I doubt it would have been still be possible. Both Chinese &amp; Russian government do understand that the only way to challenge USD hegemony is accepting bitcoin. So, I believe, your perception is probably mistaken.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:06:54


Nopes. It does NOT mean that. Something is not a 'legal tender' means u can not legally force a merchant to accept it. But, that does not mean, a merchant cant accept it. Just like u can exchange Gold with Silver, u can exchange Bitcoin with Gold. Nothing illegal here.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:15:12


Neither does Gold or Silver.
