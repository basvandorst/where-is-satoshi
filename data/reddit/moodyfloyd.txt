whoa get out of here with these hot takes
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:27:05
cheers my dude. i ended up being able to watch live but i appreciate you following through.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:40:00
there is literally no way TA can apply to our current situation. pay attention to the market attitude today, not the graphs
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:28:48
Nah, would just aid it in continual rise
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:41:48


why imagine when it is happening right in front of our eyes with btc/bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:09:30
can someone please record the prices and candles on GDAX when actually trading goes live at 1pm?
the sell wall building up looks like we could be in for a show, but i may be in a meeting at that time
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:15:00
i dont know how anyone can look at bcash and not realize how scummy the whole crew is
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:16:49
it's the of crypto. they dont care how scummy their fearless leaders are and are blind to how manipulated they are.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:13:24
yea mempool is flooded. if you can, exchange from btc to ltc and send that if you believe it to be a time sensitive exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:49:01
might as well be except about a petty guy who flaunts his wealth instead of a great tennis player

my bank transfer has been pending for 4 days now even though it has been out of my bank account since friday. coinbase is slow.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:44:32
^ this is a fun way to lose your skin. dont listen to this guy, it isnt worth the risk.
dont fuck with the IRS.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:47:31
yea ok friend. they dont care, nor do they need to. their reasons to not accept make complete sense at this time.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:32:52


uh...you could invest in banking institutions i guess
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:10:04
i think its hilarious that fox news needs to dip down to convicts to appear and talk about shit they barely understand, but i guess thats nothing too new with them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:20:56
dude i have seen reports in this sub of people waiting multiple days for confirmations.
i only sent btc with high priority once in the past week with a higher fee and it went through like normal (and none in the past months leading up to it)...been sending ltc otherwise. works like a dream.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:13:24
my man! thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:33:13
yea coinbase is more expensive. i only use it because of ease of entry and im a long term user anyways so the larger cost  in the long run is negligible.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:32:01
yea im gonna let you crazy crypto day traders sort it out and run the risks while i live my life and just set it and forget it for a while
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:05:27
yea, i know. doesnt make it **not** the conspiracy theory thats been floating around
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:53:47
thanks for knowing how to read, i promised nothing, not sure why that person thought i was making guarantees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:59:32
yep, i have learned from my past mistakes. almost halved my stack in the last year trying to play the game.
but that's ok, i learned the error of my ways and know the ways of the hodl now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:36:27


for now....at least. a month from now the'll probably forget this ever happened
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:16:28
ignore the FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) this is not out of the ordinary. this has happened multiple times this year already after hitting milestones.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:48:54
operation dragon slayer
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:20:37
rofl i love the new user influx with these surges.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:11
you get used to it, lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:36:28
i contributed to someone learning the ways of the hodl! quite the first storm you had to weather but you are stronger now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:13
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:27:07
im ok with this on the surface level. if we as a community want cryptos to be respected, we should be expected to allow gains to be taxed like in the normal market.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:04:46
i dont really buy into it being a major effect but the theory is that it will bring the people that watch that terrible show into the fold. it is, somehow, the most watched comedy on TV afterall.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:22:03
you'll learn, young padawan. sell now, regret later.

add in Verge and Monero at &lt;10% portfolio clip and thats my portfolio. 15% ROI since I entered a couple months ago
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:10:06
this is so click baity.
they are talking ICO and threw bitcoin in there because why not
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:34:11
24% interest is no joke...crypto is a crazy market. friday i was seeing 15% ROI, today if i sold, it would be -5% ROI.if i were you i would put like 80% of your invest in the 24% interest account and dabble 20% in crypto and get a feel for it. i still feel crypto is a good long term hold
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:38:40
dude he has value exceeding 1MM USD sitting available to him. he should sell a portion to do what he wants and let the rest grow. i know everyone wants to hold long term but shit, he has already achieved what most of us desire, and shouldnt be pressured to hold for more. isnt that the point here, deep down arent we all just trying to hit it big?
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:43:47
you may want to look into the podcast Unchained. and a recent episode, 202 i think, "how to explain bitcoin to the Average person: 
features 3 women bit in cryptosphere
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:15:08
still a landmark = not boring
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:27:35
so you put in like ten bucks and value ~135 now? not a bad return eh?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:10:32
i dont even have bitcoin and i created a spreadsheet to calculate gains based on all purchases of BTC, XRP, ETH.
