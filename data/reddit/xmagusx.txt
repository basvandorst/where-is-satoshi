I disagree. If you accept payment in more than one currency, you need to be prepared to offer refunds in more than one currency. If they accepted €50 for a miner and then tried to pay you back $55 when they failed to deliver because that was the exchange rate on the day you pre-ordered, what use would that be to you if you're in the EU? The same way they couldn't just claim that they "accept all currencies" and then pick whichever one tanked most in value since the pre-order date and give the refunds based on the pre-order date's exchange rate. If you paid in USD, you don't want pesos. If you paid in BTC, you don't want USD. 
It also doesn't matter how much cash HashFast has if a judge finds that they have to pay people back in BTC, at that point they either have to pay out, liquidate assets, or declare bankrupcy. If they accepted 55BTC as payment and then failed to meet their obligation, they owe the purchaser his 55BTC back.
TL;DR: Yes, failing to give people what they paid for and then refusing to give them their payment back can in fact cause your business to fail and get you sued.

TL;DR: HashFast is screwing over their customers and a lot of lawyers are about to make all the money.

Neither of which addresses the core issue of accepting something as payment and trying to force customers to take something else back when a business fails to live up to their end of the bargain. If HashFast had met their obligations, this would be a non-issue, but they didn't, and that has consequences.
Refund windows are common, roughly 30 days, and have very little to do with a pre-order in most cases. On GP though, don't accept a currency that you're not willing to refund a month later.
If a business takes on the risk of accepting pre-orders in exchange for the benefit of having funds in advance, they have to be willing to deal with the consequences of not fulfilling same. Don't want to refund BTC from cancelled orders when deadlines run out? Only sell products you actually have.

If treating BTC as a currency is capable of destroying it, then it shouldn't be used a currency. I don't believe that's the case. Asking for a refund in BTC if you paid in BTC is an entirely reasonable expectation of a currency and a business transacting regularly in that currency.
More to the point, if your business has so many returns that it can't afford to refund people's money in the same form that they're giving it to you, then your business probably deserves to fail.

The account with 30k BTC in it would be owned by BitPay, not HashFast. Elsewise I agree with your assessment.

That really depends upon why you have BTC. If you trade regularly in them and these are simply your profits, then I'd say so long as the car is not likely to depreciate too quickly and will serve as the daily driver that you need, then there's no reason not to have your transportation be something you enjoy. 
If your BTC is a form of investment for you now and your regular job doesn't provide enough to buy the car under normal circumstances, I would advise against liquidating an investment asset to pay for a toy. I would say that now is a reasonable time to diversify your holdings, if you have enough that you can max out a Roth IRA annual contribution without emptying your BTC wallet, then that's likely a much better call for you than a car. BTC is volatile, and an IRA would shield you from that somewhat. Yes, it means that if BTC jumps to 100k/coin in 2015, you're worse off. It also means that if BTC normalizes to 100/coin in 2014, you're much better off. Best as you can, hedge your investment bets -- keep some BTC for high risk/reward, but use some of that reward to make sure you have some low risk/reward steadily ensuring that you get to enjoy a comfortable retirement.
And the people saying "just borrow because BTC is absolutely certain to increase in value faster than the interest on the loan will accrue" are insane. There are no sure bets. Don't buy it if you can't afford it.

A scam? No, not a first.
