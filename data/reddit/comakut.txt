Not sure, at least I tend to selectively ignore the sticky trends since they are usually useless to me. I ignore them not only here, but in all forums in general.

And how is this supposed to be enforced with overseas sellers? Maybe you are expecting that the U.S. government will send drones to give those non-compliant sellers a well-deserved lesson?

Do you have any plans on offering payroll services? I think you guys have got so far a good reputation even with the large companies, like Dell and so on.
You could use these credentials to reach the payroll processing companies such as ADP or others (maybe ADP is too big/bureaucratic for now) to offer payroll services. You could take a lower fee than the current 1% for buying bitcoins (it would be like having "subscription" recurring customers). This could attract many new buyers (people could put aside even a small amount in bitcoin like they currently do with their 401(k)).
Employee would tell the employer what percentage/dollar amount of the paycheck they want to receive in bitcoin and their Coinbase registered e-mail address. Payroll processing company makes a deduction on the employee paycheck and transfers dollars to Coinbase. Then Coinbase deposits bitcoins into the employee Coinbase wallet (obviously they could send their bitcoins to their own wallet afterwards if they wish so).
Hope you are already considering this!

Just because all those protocols are freely available is why the Internet took off and proprietary networks such as AOL, Compuserve, The Microsoft Network, etc. died.

Bitcoin will go mainstream despite this. What will happen is that customers will check the reputation of a company before making a purchase and will only buy from reputable companies. Companies that want to stay in business will care about keeping a good reputation.

You can use multisig 2-of-3 transactions. This way the escrow never has full control over the funds. If the escrow turns out to be rogue, seller and purchaser can sign the transaction together and release the money.

I agree with everything except with the part where you hope for a stable price. Even though a stable, linear price increase would be the best, that is not going to happen. If people noticed that the bitcoin price increased in a linear way, they would want to buy bitcoin to take advantage of this price increase. This surge of bitcoin buyers would create a hype and a bubble on the price. So I think that bitcoin price will see several more bubbles and busts before mainstream adoption.

Starting October 2015 merchants in the U.S. will be liable for fraud if they haven't upgraded their systems. This will force them to upgrade because of pure economics. And we are not yet at a point where not accepting credit cards is an option for most merchants.

Pictures are obviously fake.
And the price is just 5 BTC?

The site has a decent ranking on Alexa (not that I think that Alexa is very accurate):
The site looks well designed and the explanation about bitcoin is pretty good for mainstream.
I don't think that OP is trying to promote his own site or something like that. Maybe he has exaggerated a bit, but that's it.

The scalability still needs to be solved, and fortunately that is being worked on. Once that is done, then the protocol itself will be pretty much finished, except for minor improvements. The market will do the rest (it's already doing it, in fact).

As always, the government messing up with market freedom. Instead of letting the sellers that ship late get a bad reputation and lose business, they have to create more laws.

Now I understand why I tried to pay once at a bar and it didn't go through. This happened long time ago (almost 1 year) with the old Blockchain iOS app (before it was removed from the App Store) at a merchant that was using Coinbase. Thank you for posting this. I would say that this bug is not new and has always been there.
@_date: 2014-09-03 12:18:28
Update: Received the bitcoin in my Coinbase account. Took 3 business days. In their website they mention 2-5 business days. It works!
I purchased around $8 at this website with an Amex gift card. The charge to the card was made on 8/31 (same day I purchased).
I still have not seen any news on the Bitcoin. Not a single e-mail, anything. Where are my BTC?
Hopefully this is not another scam. Will update as soon as/if I receive the coins.

FYI, Authy supports Google Authenticator. You can use the same app for everything.

None. But if you keep your coins in your own wallet, you have nothing to be afraid of.

The security of the Trust's bitcoin holdings worries me somewhat. The filing documents mention that they use cold storage and a custodian holds the private keys in several vaults throughout the US. However, they don't seem to use multisignature and multiple custodians.
Additionally, I haven't seen in the document whether they will publish the Bitcoin addresses for each Basket so that the holdings can be verified at all times.
Anybody that has read the filing and can comment on this?

You can make as many copies of the blockchain as you please. How is that DRM?

Also upvoted OP. Thanks for your comment. I also purchased train tickets from Destinia a few days ago and received the PDF files with the actual Renfe (train company) tickets. Hopefully everything goes fine.
An explanation from Destinia is definitely in order.

They didn't even learn from this old article:

I agree, pretty good article for a tabloid such as the Mirror.
@_date: 2014-08-11 03:16:25
Actually I see the article pretty well balanced. I have seen funnier articles. For example, this one (The Internet? Bah!, Newsweek):

If you don't like Bitcoin, feel free to create your own fork. If it is good, convince people to use it and people will follow you.
If you don't like bitcoin, feel free to create your own coin. You can even try things like "demurrage", as Freicoin. But there are already several hundreds of other coins out there and it looks like most of the people prefer bitcoin over those.

I agree with that.
Block size decided by the market is also part of a competitive marketplace.
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:35:48
Hey, relax. Miners and pools already compete among them and they are choosing which software they use to mine. Over 30% of the total hashpower already wants a decentralized block size limit.
