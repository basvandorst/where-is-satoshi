ha - the premium is somewhere between $1 and the current price, otherwise I would buy and hold myself right!
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:39:40
you are right - I was thinking of a FORWARD contract not a FUTURES contract:)

Ready to buy 10-20 - what's your price per coin 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:24:07
what would you price the contract at?
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:23:40
from what I remember in college - an option is standardized, a futures contract is customized... I asked a similar question on quora and it seems there are no standardized options trading - so we would have to mutually agree on a futures contract

I'll pay $300
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:57:10
Ok fine, I will make the same deal for ethereum -- $300 right now for the option to buy one eth in a year at $2,000
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:00:05
I did! He paid up! My $300 premium turned into $4000 since I bought it at $2000 (he delivered) and I sold it at $6000 I am now long $4000 us worth of ethereum on whaleclub.io at 5x leverage at 292 - all proceeds made from this trade going to startups (equity free!)

you are truly a human with honor! I hope you were holding more coins and benefitted from the run up... interesting times in which we live. You will be happy knowing I am using all my proceeds to give equity free funding to startups that would otherwise not get funding (mentorship too) 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:01:20
he paid -- $4000 net - absolute stranger 
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:03:15
still trying to buy $250 call options with the proceeds from the btc option and from the profits from being long ETH at 40
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:04:53
care to share why you did it - what you thought of the offer etc :)
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:16:23
Met him in the Bitcoin su Reddit he had a trust worthy profile 
@_date: 2017-05-04 03:11:18
Current offer - $300 for an option to buy one BTC at $2000 one year from the date of the purchase. Up to 5 coins. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:25:36
let's see if a) BTC is over 2300 in a year b) if he delivers the coin... if so, I might be able to afford an option on the bridge - I bet he pays 
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:04:19
yes! good to clarify for me and for the community -- let's see if people believe us now!

@_date: 2017-05-15 01:42:18
now I am willing to give 10 more (different people to diversify the risk) strangers on Reddit $300 each for $250 one year ETHEREUM call options (that's not for one coin, that's $300 per person I will negotiate the number of contracts with each person and share the results in a blog)
@_date: 2017-05-04 03:09:17

@_date: 2017-06-01 20:17:00
