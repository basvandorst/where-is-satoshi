The interest rate has nothing to do with the price, or the real price, in the first place.
The monetary policy of low interest rates has the goal to push people into spending their money instead of just saving it.
if interest rates are high, people are most likely to keep the money they dont necessarily need to spend.
if interest rates are low, people are consuming this money, or are putting it into investments on the capital market.
as bitcoin is one of those possibilities, you are right: you may aswell put your money into bitcoin!

Thanks! How would you count the user base? # of client downloads? # of blockchain wallets? new members of bitcointalk (this factor was actually used in a research paper)

still they were the biggest bitcoin exchange for a long time, i mean if you see the majority of the community trust gox and trade on their platform, the casual bitcoin user would be convinced of their reliability

you cant plan for extraordinary events like that, perhaps not even if you have some kind of insider information...just thought it was a really interesting happening
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:01:22
This is new and risky territory indeed, but only for Europe. There is actually several cases where central banks were going for so called "punishment deposit rates".
The macroeconomic effect is not as huge as you may expect, still the symbolicism is! Just imagine, you have to pay for saving money...

I did get my BTC back after being in contact with their law firm. The process took a while but let alone the unsecurity we all had the weeks after the shutdown of btc24, I recieved all of my coins and the overall communication with the law firm and the btc24 support was really okay, especially thinking of this complicated situation.

noted! political statemenst and one-time events (such as mtgox crash or dell accepts btc) dont have much explanatory power because they are unique and i am searching for solid, long-term correlations. still what i did add to my analysis is the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (you can read more about it here:

I wonder if Warren Buffet is around in 10-20 years...
And I don't mean that offensive at all, I just don't think
anyone who did not grow up into the Internet world can objectively judge Bitcoins potential impact.
Warren Buffet is from another age...

Well in April i tried to withdraw some BTC from my bitcoin-24 account to my wallet. Accedentially i used an invalid address and the btc were deletet from my account but logically never reached a wallet.
I contacted the support and never heared anything from them.
Soon after bitcoin-24 was shut down due to police investigation.
While this was happening there was still the possibility to contact the bitcoin-24 support, and i opened a bunch of tickets, never recieving an answer.
Two months ago a german law firm representing bitcoin-24 contacted me and asked where to send my lost btc. 
I gaven them a valid address but never heard a single word from them again.
And yesterday I finally recieved my coins.
