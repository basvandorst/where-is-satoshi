There is still a lot of back and forth here in the comments but honestly who else has had such an impact on taking BTC to such an easy user level that coinbase has? They take the scary side out of it for people and present BTC in an easy to understand user friendly way that is much needed if there is ever to be widespread BTC adoption. 
People DO want easy and fast money movement
People DON'T care to know anything about the blockchain.
People DO want an easy to use interface that allows them to manage their USD/BTC from a web browser or app.
People DON'T want to remember private keys/seeds 
If we want wide spread adoption, we have to cater to the masses and the masses don't care how anything works, they just want it to work. The rich lady that hits a speed bump in her Lexus at 20 MPH and then looks around because she doesn't know what that strange sound was... The guy in the right turn lane that doesn't understand you can turn right on red... The lady leaving the store and stops right in the door way to check her receipt who has no idea WTF is going on around her... These are the people that need to feel comfortable using BTC if there is ever to be wide spread adoption. Do you think they give a shit about private keys? NO.
That's another beautiful aspect about Coinbase. They can offer the BTC experience to them in a familiar look/security/interface/blah that they are comfortable dealing with.
If you are more technical, you don't need coinbase. But coinbase can still offer you services.
Simple as that.

I use their vault service just for that. To keep it long term and no on a whim transactions. I keep a fair amount of coin in electrum for spending. I know there is the whole key control debate. I am not a complete idiot but at this point I think coinbase can keep my coin safe than I can at the moment and if it were stolen, I think they have a proven track record of good customer service.
I am really looking forward to that USB paper wallet printer coming out.

I don't understand the point behind promoting BTC/DOGE on a damn race car. The few people I do know that are into racing are not people that are going to be interested in crypto at all. However it is "neat" what ever that is worth.

I was pretty disappointed with my last order. The item was drop shipped from the east coast and sat in a Chicago warehouse for a few days. All in all it took about 10 days to receive my item.

Many beers.
You can't spend the remainder but you can still spend from that address. It all comes down to inputs to that address, they are treated as a whole, that is what gives you the remainder. If you had and input of say .25 and had a few inputs from a faucet of .001 . lets say 10 of .001 each. So all your wallet has is 11 transactions. 1 for .25 and 10 for .001 that are all confirmed. You sent .025 to who ever. Where did that .025 come from? .01 came from the the faucets but the rest came from your .25 transaction which would have a remainder..
That remainder coin is now tied up until your transaction of sending .025 is verified.
Someone else... am I explaining this right.
More beer.

It's not that big of a deal. Once I jumped through all the the hoops of fire to get my account set up with them I love it, credit report or not. Coinbase has it purpose in the bitcoin ecosystem and I think for the most part has a great reputation. I would never use them as my only wallet.
Not only that but I do wonder what implications the state of California has had on them since they are located in San Fran. with the recent new law.
Regardless Coinbase is a great service and a good starting point for anyone not tech savvy that wants to give bitcoin a try without much intimidation of trying to learn everything there is know and having all their money stolen or lost because they can't remember or lose their wallet info.
Adoption is about ease of use. How many members of your family have useless toolbars and BS installed on their computers? You want them to use bitcoin without any help?
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:46:05
My thoughts exactly.  No way in hell they are a start up.  Going international  is all.
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:48:32
I know of the light bulb idea and the Antminer router, is this just another step in the same direction? Who is going to create the bitcoin PCI-E expansion card? While it generates little to no income, it is integral piece of the bitcoin network, you just can't choose where to mine. 
No matter, these ideas really didn't start to "click" to me until recently. We are approaching a halving again, and eventually we will have nothing left worth mining other than transaction fees.  What is going to happen to pools then? Will we have a choice? Or will there just be a network of a few parties like there is now, not the same thing, but a central power. Who wants to run a power hungry miner for the sake of transaction fees?

Defiantly do nothing. I have saved at least 1 of each type of obsolete miner I have went through. Not a huge collection but I like looking at them from time to time. Is this from black arrow? I opened up my X1 and am currently running it for fun. The touch screen is neat, wifi works great (cough bitmain) and the built in PSU was ideal for keeping it under my office desk at work.
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:09:04
Services like coinbase will also help with adoption. It's a familiar way of dealing with money for people and not "scary" because they don't understand it.

I found an ATM that is only about 10 miles from where I live and it has been a pleasure to use. The only time I had an issue was waiting for a confirmation which can happen.

This story and trial is going to make one hell of a documentary. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 02:41:46
For such a large operation and staff living on site they don't seem to worry about dust that much. Maybe that would explain the stack of dead miners and PSU's. Why not drop some coin on an air cleaning system?
Was anyone able to identify what kind of miners they were using, they kind of look like S1's with different heat sinks and face plates.
@_date: 2013-08-17 01:29:04
No telling what is going on with some of the recent news headlines. I would much rather stay with a company in the US., I don't know but it would give me a piece of mind. I will be sure to check out Coinbase when the time comes to buy in, for now I am going to focus on getting this puny miner running and learning more. I don't quite get the concept of trading but I assume it is like stock and you can sell your coins to buyers at what ever the market value is. Sounds like a lot of fun, but a bit out of reach at the moment.
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:44:46
This is pretty damn cool. Anyone try it out?
@_date: 2013-08-17 01:48:56
I still haven't read up on paper wallets yet, but I assume that is to help prevent your digital coins from theft. Have no idea what 2FA is. Is there really that much of a threat/theft problem?

@_date: 2013-11-23 03:27:16
Just have her go to the website and create an account. When you link it to your checking account I believe you have the option to select business and as far as I know if you are a merchant the fee is charged to the customer and can be directly converted to USD or what ever currency if desired and put into said checking account.
I didn't go through the whole process but I think that is how it works, anyone else?

Oh, so Minepeon isn't just an version of linux, it is set-up with a set of pools to mine also? I bookmarked the site and see they have a nice wiki so I plan to read up this weekend. My ASIC shipped today so I better get after it. Thanks!

Anytime a bank is involved it feels like dragging feet. It's unfair to blame Coinbase for things out of their control. As far as not getting back to you, that is the odd part. It seems they have great customer support.
@_date: 2013-08-15 17:24:34
As stated below I am going to try to mine since I have already ordered the ASIC. Just for fun. I have never heard of a paper wallet, thanks I will look into that. I am not sure what sites to trust and which not to so I will be doing a lot of reading before any action.  Thanks for the response!
@_date: 2013-08-15 17:28:49
Thanks for the response! I can't wait to get started. I am defiantly thinking long term, I won't buy in much with real money, but what I do buy in and mine I am not going to touch. As far as mt.gox, I just heard of them last night on here and from your post. People seem to be really freaking out that their money is stolen. Do you feel it is just a panic or an actual threat? What are some sites that you trust to prevent me from making a bad mistake. I am joining Slush's Pool because A.) it seems to be the most popular. and B.) I think that in turn means it can be trusted. I am sure there will be little payout but from what I have read going solo is not an option. Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:05:34
I just convinced the owner of my company to start accepting bitcoin. My "selling" points were:
* 1.) it is free to get started. 
* 2.) Sites like Coinbase don't charge merchants transaction fees (unlike credit cards that can add up). 
* 3.) There is a community of people eager  to spend their coins locally and will support their local merchants.
* 4.) Explained a bit, with my very limited knowledge, about how it works and how they get to be a part of the evolution of cryptocurrencie.
* 5.) I talk about it a lot and now we have something to chat about from time to time.
That was about all I had to do. Honestly I wish I had a local pizza place that accepted bitcoin.
