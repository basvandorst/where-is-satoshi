No different to when a Government or Big Business donates $100k to a local charity, and it's low enough to be pocket change to them, but big enough for most people to think of it as a lot of Money.

Let's fix it by decentralising our Government until it becomes so inefficient it stops working.

Is there a daily discussion today?
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:34:46
We will have to create a thread within a thread.

Like any other investment, difersify. Put some in BTC or Ethereum etc, but no more than like 25% max for each category (these both fall under Crypto Currency). ETF's, bonds, high interest savings accounts etc. Some will jump around in price, some will be more steady, but spread it all out so that you don't have to sell at the low points for your more risky investments.

No worries. It's the limit of 21m coins which will give anyone who HODLs today value in the future, value which one day will need to be realised, otherwise there is no use for bitcoin. 
At the end of the day, no matter the intention of why anyone uses or has bitcoin, holding it for infinity does nothing. I expect those people who hold 50+ bitcoins to begin slowly cost average dumping those coins back into the market, over years or decades.

In the meantime use a software wallet like Electrum so that you control your keys during the hard fork B2X.

Still waiting for BTCmarkets to verify my account. FMD

I'm new to Bitcoin, I know this post is 9 days old, but I just want to clarify (first for BTC Gold, then B2X).
I'm still confused about how I would go about accessing a Forked coin? If I keep my BTC in Electrum, I know that stays as just BTC. How would I gain access to BTC Gold/B2X? And if I don't, there can't be a replay attack because I only have one ledger?
I'm learning so much about how BTC works, and these forks are making it hard to keep up. Thanks in advanced if you have any answers/articles which can help me understand further.

Also what was wrong with the online validation? It was approved....

They would still use it and put it into circulation (hence spend or sell). 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:53:34
With limited supply (21m Bitcoin), eventually these people will spend or sell to make money from it, otherwise it has no value.

They said they were sending me a letter last week, still hasn't arrived.
