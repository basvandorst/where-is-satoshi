If you trust the device to report key presses and duration accurately, why not have the device just supply a random number to seed a CSPRNG?
You wouldn't be able to back up the wallet, so you wouldn't use it for large amounts of bitcoin, I hope. That means the only purpose is to use it for regular/daily spending, which would require regularly signing transactions and therefore more entropy.

Hardware is usually cheaper than engineers. Not all software needs to be fast and efficient. Sometimes it just needs to work.
I enjoy writing efficient code, but slow code that's well-documented, works reliably, and understandable to other devs is almost always better.

In addition, if they are self-employed or run a small business in the foreign country, it is likely that they will pay taxes to the US. Many countries have tax treaties with the US to avoid double taxation, but compliance can be very difficult.

For things like this, Java would get you comparable performance to C. If you're compiling it without processor-specific optimizations, Java might be faster than the C implementation.
Java isn't slow. the JVM is slow to start, and Java uses lots of memory, but it's not slow.

I have no proof for you, but I know for a fact that Musk has at least one Bitcoin. I don't know if he's interested in it beyond that.
