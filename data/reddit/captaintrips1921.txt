I mean one channel, with more than two parties
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:31:22
Thanks for your post.
I think I mostly agree with you, but with the LN there as an optional alternative to most existing on chain transactions we'll probably approach some equilibrium, goverened by block capacity. This is all some time away.
Can I ask what it is about the LN and not on chain activity that would attract regulation?
If it's a question of scale, then how do you forsee regulators would view something like BCH, if it were to become widely adopted?
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:33:01
I think I generally agree with you about regulation, in that it'll be an issue across all major crypto, to whatever extent it is an issue. I think it'll be some time before they even understand the difference between on chain and 2nd layers. It's still denominated in the same units after all.
I see the fee support issue as purely a question of scale. So if I think this through:
Say we have two blockchains, at some point in time, doing an equal number of transactions. Let's say that a 2nd layer allows for 100 times as many transactions per unit of block space (low, but let's discount for the kinds of micro/streaming transactions  that LN might induce on its own).
So, let's say Blockchain A (with LN) has a 10MB block size limit which is full a certain proportion of the time, resulting in some median tx fee.
 
We can now say that Blockchain B (without LN) with a 1GB block size limit, will be similarly filled, resulting in similar fees (but of course they are 100x in volume).
In this static scenario, with all else being equal, rational mining hashpower would distribute itself across Blockchain B and Blockchain A at a 100:1 ratio. Obviously this is a security nightmare for A.
However, I don't think it'll get to this point, because Blockchain A users would be paying, on average, 1/100 of the marginal fees that Blockchain B users are. 
There are many other factors at play and I'm not going to try and guess where that ratio might realistically settle, but demand for the cheaper Blockchain will chase up the block size and fee reward, which will be followed by hashpower. Tx for tx, a blockchain with a second layer will always be cheaper to run.
These are my thoughts this morning, anyway...

I mean one channel, with 3 signatories.
So if Alice has a channel with Bob, and Bob has a channel with Carol. Alice can pay Carol by routing the payment through Bob. In this scenario there are two channels open, represented by two on-chain multisig addresses.
I'm saying that instead of two distinct channels, why couldn't Alice, Bob and Carol all have a 3 way channel open together (single multisig address on chain) and update the split of funds between them?
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:51:58
Yep, I could have written this almost word for word. 
One particularly annoying salty coworker told me I just "got lucky" with the whole thing. 
Yeah fuckstick - that must be it. I *accidentally* wired a thousand bucks to sketchy offshore exchange in 2011 and bought Bitcoin by mistake, it wasn't because I spent the entire preceding weekend learning about and being blown away by what a revolutionary idea it was, and thought that it *might* catch on. Nobody was stopping you buying in 2011 dickhead. I'd bet my left nut you would have dismissed the idea as a criminal scam because you read about Silk Road in the paper.
Never mind he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about even now, and won't stfu with his "blockchain not bitcoin" arguments, telling me the reserve bank are gonna use blockchain to make a real currency that will "blow BTC out of the water". How does he know? He read it in the paper! The RBA chairman said so!!
For the record, I've never once brought up bitcoin at work, I've only made the mistake of not feigning ignorance when asked about it. I'm happy to talk to the handful of coworkers who are actually interested and keen to learn how it works, but goddamn I wish I'd hodled on to more instead of selling out too much too early. I could quit this job and send that salty asshole a photo of myself on the beach everyday.
I think my rant was longer than yours OP, but I feel better now.
Good thread.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:17:48
Yeah, the "Bitcoin is a fad, but blockchain is the important development" narrative is strong in the media and therefore in my coworkers. 
In the last month or two I've read so many articles that are just parroted buzzwords because the writer lacks fundamental understanding.
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:22:31
Sorry I don't think I was being clear enough:
I'm talking about having a single channel open between 3+ parties, not routing transactions through a third party.
So Alice, Bob and Carol all commit funds to the same multisig on chain, and as they transact with each other they update the state of their channel to reflect the latest balances between the three of them.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:51:24
The blocksize will be configured to serve a typical demand but an event like this would potentially cause a huge short term spike that would need managing somehow.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:11:05
you're right. It just burns my piss is all.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:14:32
Can you explain why you think that?
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:41:35
okay, even around the 18th though, that's a massive over-estimation by the ledger wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:47:06
I guess you mean nobody *has* solved the routing problem?
I don't have a debunk statement for that. I also don't think there needs to be a single or perfect solution. I'm tired and going to sleep now, but I was planning on watching this talk in the morning, we both might find it informative:
I think he discusses routing toward the end.

What is a "hub"? It's not a new concept, it's just the name we're giving to a well connected node in the network. When forwarding a payment, a node doesn't know its source or destination, in fact, it doesn't even know if its the first, 10th or last hop in the route, which makes it a very poor target for KYC.


The (low) fees. This is a question that's been asked and answered for years, long before 2nd layers were thought of. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:58:26
ohhhh ok so you're talking about increased adoption. 
In that case yeah, at some point the current block size will not be enough and it will have to be increased.
Relatively wide adoption of the LN could easily increase the total tx capacity (on chain + 2nd layer) of a block by a couple of orders of magnitude compared to 100% on chain tx.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:04:04
I like this, I should have done this.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:59:29
Yes, yes and yes. 3/3 correct :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:08:47
I'm not sure how much of it is genuine misunderstanding and how much is deliberate spreading of misinformation. 
They also like to equate LN Hubs (which are really just well connected nodes) to banks, and say they'll be subject to KYC/AML and be able to confiscate your funds.
They generally fail to recognise that segwit is an effective soft block size increase.
Another common one is that "opening and closing LN channels will cost insanely high fees" (I've seen anywhere from $100 to $1000 quoted). This stems from somehow thinking that increased use of LN wouldn't reduce demand for on chain transactions.
They talk about "LN tokens", and don't seem to recognise that LN transactions are valid bitcoin transactions that can be broadcast at any time to close a channel and move the funds you're entitled to on chain.
There's more... but yeah, willful ignorance is probably a pretty good general description.
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:15:53
I've used independent reserve and btc markets, I would recommend either/both.
Not sure exactly how new you are to Bitcoin, but it's good to see you asking about wallets because it means you're not intending to just leave your bitcoin in the exchange like many do. One of the key features of Bitcoin is that it gives you the ability (and responsibility) of storing your own money without having to trust anyone. I learned this the hard way in 2014 (Mt Gox).
Anyway, for $100 it's not worth it for you to buy a hardware wallet yet. On Android I've been using Samourai wallet and I'm happy with it. I was happy with Mycelium for a long time but switched recently because they've been too slow to implement segwit. Electrum is a good desktop wallet (I wouldn't recommend the current Android version of it for beginners though).
If you've got an iPhone, I can't speak from experience but I think a lot of people like breadwallet.
The key feature I look for in a wallet is really the ability to set custom fees. The automatic fee estimators generally suck and you end up overpaying needlessly.
When you first install the wallet it'll give you a string of words which you need to write down and store in a safe place (or two safe places) and keep secret. If something happens to your phone, those words are a backup that will let you restore your wallet on a new device.
Feel free to ask away if you've got any questions.

Good article.
Somebody should post that Satoshi email in r/btc. They'll have a brain aneurysm.

Salient point. That video doesn't get enough play.
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:43:23
have a look at - this is a common misconception over there (a bit less so lately)
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:38:44
As far as I can see, currently KYC/AML sits firmly on the fiat/crypto barrier and nowhere else. I've got a fistful of unverified accounts on exchanges that I can get crypto in and out of no problem. They have no idea who I am, they have no idea if the address I'm depositing from actually belongs to Kim Jong Un or ISIS. Same with the address I withdraw to, and I can use a different address for every single deposit and withdrawal that I make.
For the foreseeable future, I think regulation will remain on the fiat/crypto barrier because that's the only place that it can be effective in its current form. If adoption really does ramp up and people start dealing IRL in crypto, I think there'll be a "wild west" period - a revival of the cash economy of yesteryear that's all but been stamped out in modern society.
They'll figure something out that fits crypto eventually, but I'm tipping that the economy will already be somewhat established by the time they do.
Just my two cents - who knows! That's why being here now at this early stage is so interesting to me I guess.
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:08:01

I've had the same thought as you about what might happen if there's an event like an exchange or otherwise large hub closure/failure. I think the connectedness of your channel partner will guide what the locktime parameter should be. 
Non segwit blocks can do close to 600k (250b) tx/day right now, and Coinbase has like 12M users. So that would be 20+ days of the blockchain being completely rammed with desparate channel closers paying high fees make sure they get closed out. That sort of says to me that you'd want a locktime of a month or so - but there's a couple of things that could help:
1. Some significant proportion of the channels probably wouldn't have enough funds in them for users to bother with them.
2. There could be some kind of service for batching multiple users' closing transactions together, which would mean you could fit way more into a block. Not sure if there's some way to do this trustlessly...
3. This scenario is also assuming that the exchange is maliciously trying to steal everyone's money by broadcasting previous channel states. Could happen!
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:10:25
Not sure if I've got this right, but I'll assume from what you wrote that Bob has a channel with Alice2, and he started with 1BTC on his end of the channel.
When Alice1 broadcasts the old state of the channel, Alice2 sees it before the locktime expires and broadcasts the penalty transaction, so the Alice1-Alice2 channel closes with Alice1 having 0BTC and Alice2 having 2BTC from that channel. 
The Alice2-Bob channel is unaffected by this.
As I write this I think the point that will help your understanding is that funds are quarantined inside channels. If I'm connected to two parties by seperate channels, I can't move BTC between those channels freely. If I'm relaying a 0.5 BTC Transaction, 0.5 BTC will come to my side of one channel, and in another channel I'll send 0.5 BTC from my side of that channel to the recipient's side.
Ended up being long winded, sorry. Feel free to ask for clarity.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:44:21
It'd be funny to watch them squirm and contort themselves in order to deny the meaning. 
I've got no disillusions about them actually changing their minds.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:13:35
BTC is BTC. Single blockchain, different exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:51:55
The size of the transaction is dictated by the nuber of inputs and outputs it has. A typical transaction might have a one or two input addresses and two output addresses, but if you're sending a tiny amount of BTC from 50 different addresses, the transaction needs to be larger because you need to include the signature for each input address.
Users are essentially bidding against each other for limited block space, so yeah, when the network is really busy like it was a couple of days ago, there would me more fees in the block compared to when it's quiet. 
This chart shows the number of unconfirmed transactions over the last two weeks. The coloured layers indicate fee rates attached. As you can see, the attached fees climb as the network gets busy: 
Check out Andreas Antonopolous' youtube channel for good info to get you up to speed in general. Mining has been a specialised game for some time now, you'll almost certainly end up with more BTC for your fiat if you just buy it directly rather than spending on mining equipment and electricity.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:27:50
For a typical transaction, the fee is relatively flat, and not really dependant on the value as we're used to with fiat (i.e. a 100 BTC transaction will need no bigger a fee than a 0.001BTC transaction). 
There is a limited amount of space for transactions in each block, so miners will always prioritise transactions that have the highest per byte fee attached. A typical transaction with one input and two outputs will be around 200 to 250 bytes, but can be bigger depending on how many inputs and outputs there are.
To answer your question, it would be cheaper to make one transaction rather than two.
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:08:53
I have the same reaction as you. I've read countless articles about the uses for blockchain and they never go into any detail about how it works - and I'm really interested to hear how it's supposed to work!
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:42:55
Thanks for the link, but what I'm really wanting to know is how it would actually work in practice. 
I can sort of see how an ASX clearing house or an inter bank transfer system would work if I assume access is permissioned to member-participants who all run full nodes, and there's some kind of monetised token so they can come to concensus among themselves using a proof of stake system. This would see improved efficiency because it removes the need for a lot of trust between multiple entities who trade frequently among themselves, but a blockchain database WITHIN an organisation just seems totally pointless. It's not immutable if you're the only one adding blocks, so why not just use a normal database instead?
