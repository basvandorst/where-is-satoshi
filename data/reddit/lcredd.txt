It certainly isn't flawless, why don't you watch the talk before getting offended? He's been talking about a lot of problems Linux land has had for years under the same title and has some valid points to consider. It is just one man's opinion, but stating "Linux doesn't suck" is pretty ignorant if you haven't listened to the talk.
Above all else, thinking Linux is above criticism for any arbitrary reason is just foolish, fanboyish and ultimately detrimental to it's adoption or progress and in my opinion, highly ironic if you believe in any OSS ideals.
Just watch the damn video.
edit: he ninjad his comment, nvm the troll

Hahaha, for real yo, lay off the bong, you're the only idiot here.

The dude is smoking "fat bowls", confused about who replied to who, asking the same questions repeatedly, seems easily impressionable and he's apologetic to the "assholes" he's offended.
I'd say he's another kind of poster child, but why not both?

You can read and extrapolate anything you please from my commentary, if coming up with lofty ideas that could apply to my life-story help you deal with my criticism of you, it really says more about your being than mine.
I sure don't peg my self-worth in what people think of me on the internet, but I also don't ask stupid questions AND call responders assholes for being stumped by a seemingly obtuse stoner.
You're the one that found it worthwhile to take time reading through my comment history for a cheap quip.

Alright, ill bite.
1. You were given answers, you misinterpreted them, were corrected and still insistend on your confused and wrong theory about where these missing blocks are. Thats called being obtuse.
2. You did, when you didnt like people criticising you posted a comment on  how some people were being "assholes" despite everyone being respectful.
3. Youre delusional.
4. I never commented on how bitcoin works, youve lost track of who youre talking to... again.
5. Fucking hell, the internet is not "real life", don't give me some cock and bull story about cultural importance for respect. You have to behave in a respectable manner to be treated with it, you do not carry yourself in a respectable manner.
6. On top of everything else, you're a hypocrite given your first reply to me.
Protip, if you spent as much time reviewing your own comments as you did mine, maybe you'd see what I mean. Do or don't, I don't care.
Either way, I'm sure i can look forward to you stalking me on reddit for years to come. Cya around creep

Huh, looks more like the Indian symbol of peace to me. Maybe it's a matter of perspective.

I'm here if you need to talk.

If this was r/GBP or r/USD, would you say the same? I'm not really arguing your point, I even agree in a way, but given the context; "this subreddit is about money" isn't inaccurate and the nuances of that statement are worth considering. 
I think the comparison made in the article was made more or less in the financial sense even if it was tactless.
Ultimately, this subreddit IS about money.
I don't think anyone should whip out their pitchforks yet.

I just threw in my 2 cents about it because I think of all places, this is the right sub to be mindful and objective about these matters.
Money has no feelings, people do. 
Having said that, you're right. We all believe bitcoin is important in more ways than churning out profit. 
All the more reason to keep emotions in check, do you agree?
(Despite all that, I think it'd be worthwhile to point out to the writer that it wasn't a good comparison to make.. but we can probably do without his head on a pike.)
