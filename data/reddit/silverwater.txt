If you really want them to learn real-life and applicable Bitcoin skillz, you should teach bitcoin security with different types of wallets. 
Show them how to make a paper wallet. Show them how to wipe a hard-drive and install linux (after verifying the distro's check sum) on a laptop. Show them how to use this for signing transactions offline. Show them how writing down the 12 word seed to a deterministic wallet like Electrum protects them from their own stupidity and hardware failure.

I take it you're looking for a non-cold-storage solution - a secure wallet that you actually use to spend coins from on a regular basis.
Well for starters, if you've got a large amount of coins you should be keeping the bulk of them in cold storage. If you don't plan on spending them any time soon it's just an unnecessary risk. I always liked to use Electrum for cold storage "savings account" by making a new wallet, writing down the seed, erasing the wallet with a program like Eraser (still after encrypting it with a ridiculous password for good measure), then restoring it was a "watch only" wallet in Electrum. This gives me a "live" wallet to send funds to, but impossible to move funds out of without the seed. 
But for a wallet to actively spend with and be really secure,  I'd suggest using Electrum's ability to sign transactions offline. The multi-sig technique is definitely better than nothing, but ultimately not having your private keys exposed to the internet at all is the safest way to be.
Or even simpler, just invest the $80 or whatever it is for a Trezor. 
If you've gotta take some coins with you, Mycelium is my preferred app. Good encryption, makes nice paper backups for you to print so you can restore your keys is you lose your phone, and if it's stolen the thieves have to figure out your 6 digit pin code before you restore your keys.

Hi Ben -
Your proposed legislation is useless.
A: It will not reduce "illicit" or illegal activity. This shows a huge lack of understanding of the technology, and in technology in general. 
B: All I'm reading here is that New Yorkers will be legally obligated to jump through a bunch of bullshit hoops to just to engage in harmless OTC trading. But no worries, as everyone will just ignore this shit anyways. If I want to buy a bitcoin for $600, then sell it to someone else for $640, I'm not going to go get a fucking license to do this. Do I need a license to buy something on Ebay, then sell it for a slightly higher price?
I do however have no problems reporting any gains through trading come tax day. If this is income it should be reported and subject to the tax code.
C: **Forfeit Bitcoins that are inactive for over 5 years to the State of New York - (200.12c)** 
Straight up reply: Fuck you. Got any antiques, classic cars, baseball cards, or jewelry that haven't been "active" for 5 years? Give them to me. Actually, isn't this what the Nazis did in WWII? Robbed people of their assets to help fund the war effort? Seriously, go fuck yourself on this one.
D: **Not obfuscate any transactions - Bitcoin mixing would be illegal. (200.15f)** **Retain all transaction logs for 10 years, including real name &amp; physical addresses of ALL parties of a transaction - yes, including whoever you are sending to. (200.12a1)**
Yet from your post: "These regulations include provisions to help safeguard customer assets, protect against cyber hacking"
Question for you Ben: Do you see anything contradictory in these two things?
If you don't, then maybe you and the other authors have no business writing this legislation. Obfuscation and personal anonymity help users from wearing a giant bull's eye on their forehead for hackers. Still don't get it? Here it is in simple terms: Hacker knows your identity. Hacker knows you have a substantial amount of bitcoins. Hacker steals your bitcoins. 
Does this legislation provide insurance against theft like the FDIC for banks? If not, then again, fuck you.
To summarize: This legislation is just an attempt by the state to gain some measure of control. But it's time to wake up and smell the coffee Ben - Neither the state or any other single entity will be able to control this technology. **Just get over it and move on.**  
If financing terrorism and money laundering on a grand scale are really what concerns the state, then all it takes is assigning enough resources to the case to find the "real" criminals. 
This legislation inevitably will make criminals out of a bunch of harmless cryptography geeks. What is the state going to do, round 'em up for prosecution? Yeah, what a great use of tax dollars.

I started a $300 withdrawal a couple weeks ago. After a week of waiting I asked how long it would take (since there was no indication when you click "withdraw"). They told it took two weeks. 
I canceled the withdraw immediately. "two weeks" sounded too much like "I have no idea". Plus, since it was the first time I used the bank withdrawal method there could have been some error that would have made me start the whole process all over again.

Definitely. Turkey faced this same issue 10 years or so ago, except going the other way. The Turkish Lira was well over 1,000,000 for 1 USD, so the government basically said FU to six zeros and called it the New Turkish Lira. 
Then a couple years later they just started calling the Turkish Lira again. Done and done.
That actually might not be a bad way for Bitcoin to go. Move the decimal a couple spots and call it NBTC (because who doesn't like to get new stuff, right?). Then later on drop the "N" and call them Bitcoins again, at which point people will hardly notice.
At least we'd know it's something that's worked before.

 &gt; Something that depends on technology not improving in the future isn't a good store of value over long time periods.
Great point. A counter could be that since Bitcoin works well enough and infrastructure for a new payment technology isn't something that can be built in a day, it's conceivable that Bitcoin will retain at least some of its value. An analogy could be Usenet -&gt; WWW. The World Wide Web certainly was an improvement, but Usenet is still alive and kicking.
In the end however it's not the long-term success of Bitcoin that makes it an important invention - it's the fact that a decentralized and trustless payment network has been shown to be possible. Game-changer.

And we all know how useful personal checks are these days.


Agreed, but that's besides the point, since these things are not likely on the mind of an average consumer when they use standard currencies. With Bitcoin, people are automatically going to have holes in their knowledge when it comes to security. A question common being: "Why the hell can't someone just copy more of them?". To adequately explain this or any other security concern you've got to start explaining the blockchain and the verification system on a p2p network made up of people setting their computers to do complex math problems so they can mine...it's a lot. Fail to get these points across, and it takes blind faith on their part that everything works. Yes their participation in the current financial system is done equally blind, but acceptance comes pretty easy when it's all you've ever known and you see everyone else around you using it. 
But this is only after they can wrap their heads around the concept of a wallet, or get over having some long-ass string of digits as their address, instead of STEVESMONEY 


What percentage of the planet alive today has ever kept their wealth in gold? Right.


A lot of apps already have point and click backups, but you forget that for someone to even understand how a backup wallet key works (and therefore can put their faith in it) they have a basic level of understanding of how the technology functions. Not to mention the lack of faith that this will result in the same peace of mind they have when their money is in a bank. And let's get real here, it's going to take quite a lot of new ideas to make your bitcoins as safe from theft as money in a bank account. Even if someone robs the bank, you're still going to have your money from the insurance. Credit card and bank transactions can be reversed. Lose your bitcoins and there's nothing you can do except go find the guy, and the lack of reversal is actually quite a significant part of the technology's make up.


I'm pretty sure I'd end up talking out of my ass if went any further with this, since you're much more acquainted with economics than me. It's all a red herring though, since your counter-argument should have been at least been some specific examples or a plausible scenario in which a country would choose to end any kind of financially beneficial relationship with the dollar for political reasons.


Ok I can buy that. If bitcoin gets over these roadblocks we talked about, in 15 or 20 years after the technology has proven to be rock solid, there's no reason why people wouldn't view its reliability as anything less than what people generally feel about FIAT. Especially since it was designed to be more reliable.

I'd say just go with Electrum for your watch-only wallet, since not only is it lightweight but the watch only feature is designed right in it.
I've abandoned pure paper backups in favor of an Electrum watch only wallet (with the 12 word seed written on a piece of paper). Works well enough for my purposes. 
Steps (after downloading Electrum):
1. Create a new wallet
2. Write down the 12 word seed
3. Encrypt with an obnoxious password (you won't have to remember it, the encrypted wallet will be deleted in a few seconds. Encrypting is just good in case you don't fully wipe your hard drive and the wallet.dat file gets necro'ed)h
4. Click Wallet -&gt; Master Public Key. Copy and paste the number to clipboard (doesn't matter if this gets compromised)
5. Create a 2nd wallet. Choose "Restore from Master Public Key" or whatever. Paste it in. You now have a watch only wallet.
6. Go to your Electrum/wallets folder, delete your 1st wallet. Empty trash, wipe your hard drive's free space.
When you want to spend your money, you just have to create a new wallet, select "Restore From Seed", enter the seed you wrote down. Good enough for me.

It's purely psychological, it's a "thing" whether anyone wants it to be or not. 
And since the consensus seems be in favor of pushing Bitcoin as far into the mainstream as possible, it probably wouldn't hurt to have one less "thing" for people to have to come to terms with. The Turkish govt. felt that it was worth making the switch.

From most of what I've read, people are being advised by their financial advisors to invest no more than 1% of their portfolio in Bitcoin. This doesn't seem like bad logic, considering the uncertainties still left out there for the cryptocurrency. 


Yes. Though to be honest, not 100% of the time. However at this point, many of the "true believers" like myself could consider a transaction like this to actually be an investment of sorts - the mindset being that using BTC for purchases like this and encouraging merchants to accept Bitcoin are the the best ways to see their holdings increase, since the more mainstream it becomes, the more valuable one's own holdings become. This, by the way, is why people were pushing the "bitcoin black friday" idea so much - The best way to get your coins to increase is to be spending some of them to push for mainstream usage/acceptance, I think. 
FYI: I'd consider myself a "true believer" in Bitcoin, because it has clear advantages to processing transactions with Credit Cards / PayPal. Eliminating chargeback risks and and CC fees can increase a businesses's margins significantly, especially ones with low margins to begin with. Having a checkout system that immediately converts the BTC to fiat keeps the merchant free of the market's volatility. There really are no downsides for them to take BTC as payment. 
Some (libertarian folks mostly) like the anonymity, no-inflation, decentralized aspects. Their motives are as politically motivated for the most part, as much as it is a technological movement for others. 
I do find the whole thing fascinating, to say the least. With the technology, people don't need to fight government policy/systems head on; the decentralized system basically just allows them to make government irrelevant, bypassing the current banking systems entirely. And who wouldn't want to cut out the middle man if they could? All CCs/PayPal are are middlemen who skim off the top because they are the ones facilitating a transaction between two parties. But the trustless nature of cryptocurrencies make the their services unnecessary and redundant.
As an investment, it would be naive to say that the value couldn't eventually become 0. However, I'd probably say it has a 90% of working out work out pretty well as an investment at this point.
Many thought that government interference would be BTCs one and only challenge to fame, glory, and rides to the moon. But the government response has been rather favorable up to this point (I think they understand that shutting down the system would be as effective as trying to shutdown torrent sites.) Actually I now think that BTC's biggest threat may come from alt currencies, as many of these currencies claim to have improved on BTC to a certain extent. The volatility issue is of course an impediment to mainstream adoption, but I expect the price to find some sort of stability later down the road. The currency's future is just too up in the air right now, but I expect stability will inevitably come when BTC starts to settle in to its new role in the financial landscape.
There are just too many positives for merchants to accept it (many stores in my area won't take anything but cash because of the high credit/debit card fees, it's actualy quite annoying to pop over to their atm and pay a $2.00 fee to take cash out for a $2.50 Gatorade). Plus, a system like Bitcoin will naturally lead to a ton of innovations down the road, that will make what possible what once was considered impossible. 
Ok this post has become a little bit incoherent, I've become a night owl lately and 9:00AM is just about bedtime for me. So excuse my poor sentence structure and babbling - I hope I at least got  my points across well enough.

I believe Bitcoin's biggest hurdle will be that of government regulation
The biggest hurdle? Even more so than people deciding to give their wealth over to a technology that operates in such a radically different way than what they're used to? One that may seem extremely complex to them? One where their money is not an insured bank account but is kept at home like hiding money under their bed, or maybe on their computers or on the web, where evil hackers lurk, or on their smartphones which they've lost half a dozen of at bars over the last few years? 
I'd even say people getting over the fact there's no physical coin or bill they can touch is a bigger hurdle than government regulation.
 I know a lot of of enthusiasts worry about government intervention, but at this point I haven't seen any evidence that we're heading in that direction. though to be fair, it's probably because governments don't see it as a real threat. Frankly, they'd probably find the idea of a decentralized currency overtaking the major world currencies too ridiculous to entertain. The only ones who see it having that potential to be a threat are people like you and I, who have gotten comfortable enough using it that we can now see its advantages. 
I think that if does Bitcoin become the new standard, by the time governments start to realize that it's for real real, it will have become a daily reality for enough people that they politicians won't be able to regulate against it without feeling the pushback from voters.
In addition, I don't see how a government's "resentment for the PetroDollar", or any other kind of political views playing a factor in decisions that benefit them economically. Look at the list of countries pegged to the dollar...Vietnam, Belize, Lebanon, Belize, Cambodia, North Korea, Somalia...
If governments just simply "resented the status" of the dollar, I bet they'd rather have their country's currency with this status as opposed to something they can't control. Honestly it feels like you're just injecting your personal political leanings into your theory.


I agree with this though!

I don't think it matters. His whole arguement centers around "gold's intrinsic value". I don't like wearing jewelry, so what's gold to me? It's just another rock, albeit a shinier one. It's a good conductant of electricity and is soft enough that it can be worked easily for a metal, but if it were being priced for its industrial value it would be wayyy overpriced.
No, the "intrinsic value" comes from its history of being traded as a a currency, which is only because people have always liked to show off their bling bling to the neighbors.

FWIW: I'm not an expert in this era, but while I was researching a paper about the origins of Jazz and Blues music I came across a many articles from the medical/scientific community in the 18th and 19th century whose "research" declared that those of African descent inherently inferior to those of European descent. (Ironic of course, now that modern genetics has concluded every human is actually of African descent).
Anyways, if the widely held belief amongst the scientific community at the time was that black people were something below human, *technically* it would get Jefferson off the hook for being a hypocrite in this case.
He'd have been horribly wrong and misguided in this belief of course, but it wouldn't immediately disqualify any of his philosophies and contributions in the area of political science. Taking a lesson in genetics from Thomas Jefferson would be about as useful as taking figure skating lessons from Dennis Rodman.

See my comment above. One thing I've learned is never underestimate the ingenuity of hackers/scammers.
If I'm missing something here correct me, but I think having a "greenlist" as you put it may only encourage hackers to find out which computers have bitcoin wallets on them, and how much.
The one and ONLY thing that I give the advantage to traditional banking over Bitcoin is the FDIC. With traditional banking, you never have to worry that someone is going to steal your money (unless you count inflation and unnecessary fees as stealing).
Bitcoin on the other hand, is almost like keeping your money in a jar under your bed. Except your bed is connected to the internet.

From a conversation on this thread with someone involved in the site, they  only let you make purchases with BTC. Selling in BTC without some kind of escrow system is still extremely risky for merchants.

Could have been those pesky (or friendly?) Ancient Aliens.
But seriously, who cares?  Many people would find the topic of cryptography interesting enough on its own to try and develop some stuff with it. My grasp of it is fairly rudimentary compared to some, but if thousands of programmers can look at the source code and say "Yeah this is legit", then I'm good with that. Being paranoid about things without any basis for being so is no way to go through life.

Worked perfectly for me.
This is great. I've been saying all along that Bitcoin's biggest shortcoming at this point is the inability purchase coins quickly and easily. This changes that.
The 1% + $0.15 is very reasonable as well, especially considering the fees when exchanging paper currencies and the fees associated with other quick-buy methods like BitInstant. Personally speaking, I hate the idea of "spending money on money", so the 5 day Dwolla ($0.25) into CampBX (.55%) method might still be viable as well.
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:45:25
Because of the situation i just described for you?
If you close the bank account before the funds clear there's nothing Coinbase can do.
So many risks attached to selling an irreversible currency.
I get that it sucks not being able to make instant buys without a credit card. I know I'd definitely gotten used to being able to acquire BTC without any hassle.  Maybe they could have a lower daily limit for people without a verified credit card? Hell I've never even needed to withdraw any more than 4 BTC in a day.

Why do you think this?
@_date: 2013-10-20 15:29:35
Relevant information here would be what method you were going to use to buy.
Short answer: If you're doing a transfer from PayPal or another online method, then the seller has plenty of justification for wanting you to verify your ID. He *could* be legit, but don't do it. Too risky.
My advice: Find someone with over a hundred transactions and a stellar feedback record, who is accepting cash deposits at a bank near you. 
These guys are basically pro sellers, so their prices will be better than most. You'll get your coins fast too.

I believe it's true that Ulbricht wouldn't be allowed to take the 5th if can be proven that he was the owner of the coins (giving up the password wouldn't be incriminating himself at that point since ownership was already proven).

Not sure if it's been mentioned, but (to the best of my knowledge) an attack like that would only allow someone to tamper with the system until the next block is mined.

I hope this helps to get some in this subreddit to start removing their tin-foil hats. 
It only takes a rudimentary knowledge of how bitcoin works to know that the law can't limit its usage any more than copyright laws can limit illegal file sharing through torrents. It also doesn't take a genius to reach the conclusion that a total and outright government ban on the technology would not limit the criminal activity being done with it, it would just make it so criminals are the pretty much only ones who want to use it. 
Governments (at least the US) *will* make sure they're doing everything in their power to limit tax-evasion however. Will be interesting to see what regulations shake out in the future.

Just curious: I get trolling something that you find offensive like Westboro Baptist Church or whatever, or maybe just trolling a group because you generally disagree with their politics. So I'm guessing there's something about bitcoin that irks you? Wondering what that might be. 
I just seems that if bitcoin is as useless as you say, then it'll fade away into oblivion, regardless of who said what on Reddit when outcome of the experiment was yet to be determined. In that case the opportunities for "I told you so!" moments will be much more plentiful and satisfying.

Coinbase is the only company (that I know of anyways) with the balls to offer instant buys/sells for verified users. 
Most other ways of getting bitcoin are a little bit clunky. Local Bitcoins is pretty good, but the vast majority of sellers ther operate by having people deposit cash into to the seller's bank account, then once you produce a receipt for proof of deposit, they'll transfer you the coins. 
Bitcoin's lack of chargeback make it so people could buy coins with PaPal or credit cards, then report the transaction as fraud and get their money back. The bitcoin seller on the other hand, is shit out of luck.
So that's why I give Coinbase props, and I fully recommend going through the necessary steps to get a verified account for instant buys.

So really it should be said that Bitcoin isn't anonymous, unless you're motivated enough to make 2-3 extra mouse clicks or screen taps.

Let's say for one year, a person gained 1 Bitcoin per day, and every day they sent them to the same address in their desktop wallet. Wouldn't they just be tempting a hacker watching the blockchain to find out the identity of the address' owner and relieve them of their wallet of 365 BTC via trojan/keylogger? 
Correct me if I'm wrong.

I That's a rude response to a thoughtful comment. You might want to consider ablengata's words, or at least consider the perspective of whoever's job it is at coinbase to help you. Depending on what kind of managerial oversight this person has regarding customer complaints, profanity laced tirades only increases your chances of getting pushed to the bottom of his/her list, if not ignored completely. If I were a manager and at all concerned about my employees' well-being, I'd tell them to straight-up delete complaints like yours.  
Take it from someone who's had anger management issues - even though you feel like your anger is justified, the way you're going about things isn't going to help you solve your problem. Even this thread is being downvoted as we speak because of your responses to ablengata, decreasing the changes that you'll get an answer to this question. I myself had a similar experience with mtgox - long story short, I became locked out of my account for 2 weeks right after making a large deposit with the intention of selling when the price was dropping rapidly, and their lack of clear communication contributed greatly to this problem. However instead of being an asshole about it, my communications were polite while remaining stern, and I ended up getting access back a week earlier than when their policy dictates. 
To answer your original question: If you're in the US, you could try funding a Dwolla account and transferring those funds to an exchange house that accepts Dwolla. CampBX does, last time I checked. Downside is bank transfers to Dwolla take 5 days to clear, upside is Dwolla only has a $0.25 transaction fee. If you prefer having an "instant" option, there's none out there I've seen that don't have a mess of fees besides Conbase, so you should hope that you didn't burn any bridges with their staff.

Solid points. There many people who have bitcoins who just plan to sit on them indefinitely, that can't be denied.


The applications that people will come up with will probably blow our minds. My mind was pretty blown when I discovered Satoshi Dice - not from the gambling aspect, it was the fact that I could gamble without even *setting up an account*. It's not even necessary to visit the website, you just need the bitcoin address of the % odds you want to play and send the coins. If you win they get bounced back to the sender's address automatically. 


True that. Actually it brings up the point of why people put their money in banks to begin with, which is the FDIC backed guarantee that their money isn't going to disappear. "Being your own bank" with bitcoin comes with no such guarantees. You can be secure from malware with it if you know what you're doing, but not everyone puts in the effort to learn. 
An affordable, user-friendly (idiot-proof), offline, Bitcoin-dedicated device will probably come on the market at the some point.

I know you didn't address me, but I just thought I'd lend another perspective from someone who's a fan of Bitcoin *and* I agree with Krugman on a lot of things (including stimulus):
I like Bitcoin because:
1. It can help with the developing world.
2. It can help with charity (micropayments, no need to fill out credit card forms etc).
3. I like the idea of reduced fees for merchants translating into cheaper goods and services for me.
4. I don't see Bitcoin making fiat become extinct, but I like having another option out there. 
5. I like the independence/control of that bitcoin gives the individual, while also being a beautifully democratic system.
6. I'm a techie and fascinated with nerdy stuff.
Just to be clear, I don't *like* stimulus, I just think that sometimes it can be the lesser of two evils. Agree to disagree on that one.

Good question. The only thing campaigns hate more than being broke is having the conversation turn from their talking points to allegations of something they did wrong. Law enforcement probably doesn't care about a few anonymous hundred dollar bills that get sent to candidates, but conversely candidates probably don't care enough to keep it them either. It's the 1mil in a briefcase that everyone's watching out for, and 50,000 BTC from "John Smith" on 123 Main Street will certainly be investigated. Spreading large amounts out through thousands of small contributions would be even harder to hide.
Campaigns are also forced to be very open about their financial status, and for posterity's sake at least make it *seem* like they're an open book for all the world to see (It's the art of campaigning really).
The irony of this situation here is that despite all Bitcoin's capabilities as anonymizer, regulation that comes to pass here could give law enforcement the clearest most unfoolable way to monitor candidate's accounts to date. I know many of my libertarian brothers and sisters may be opposed to this, but I would love to see the day when all contributions were forced to go though Bitcoin.

The situation the OP described was different though. He described a scene in which a country unilaterally show itself in the foot over some kind of petty feeling of inadequacy.

That's something to consider. I'd also consider if that statistic accounts for PayPal users or even people who use a debit card, since using PayPal or making a debit card transaction isn't really that different paying with bitcoins. 
The more important thing to consider is that less than half the world is able to even open bank account or have a something like a PayPal account. Bitcoin software is always free and open source. 
There's more than one kind of ideology that bitcoin agrees with ;-)

There are a thousands of ways to tie a wallet to a person. 
If it's an online wallet, then you'd be registering with an email address, and there would be an IP address associated with your login. 
If it's a mobile wallet, well the phone would be probably registered in your name.
For all kinds of wallets, any email/text/forum post etc that could be linked back to you in which you display one of your receiving addresses would be a way to prove you were in control of the wallet.
Or, the FBI spies on you for a couple month then seizes all your gear. That would be another way.

Its value comes more from its predictability and utility as a payment system than the resources burned during the mining process. I could use a bunch of electricity and have computer churn out number sequences or calculate probability outcomes for useless scenarios all day, but would that give me something of value? No.
It's the fact that the number of coins produced is set in stone, and unable to be manipulated by the whim of any central or 3rd party (trustless). Add to that the speed, ease, efficiency, and flexibility it offers as a payment processor. No it's not perfect, but Bitcoin is not competing with perfect currencies, far from it actually.
The comparison to gold's "intrinsic value" is getting old as well. Why not compare it to fiat currencies' intrinsic value? We've all been exchanging goods and services for worthless bits of paper for as long as we can remember, but has that slowed anybody down?
No, because nobody gives a shit about intrinsic value. It's all subjective anyways.

I'm not sure how that's lame. For personal use it's more than enough, which is what Coinbase is designed for. If they wanted to be the next Mtgox or Bitstamp, they'd be trading at around .5% like the rest of them, instead of 1%. 
No one should have a reason to convert that much fiat into currency *instantly*, unless they're a price speculator. But they're not a very good one if they're paying %50 more in trading fees than is necessary.

Man some of you guys really need to study up on how this shit works. Bitcoin stops being anonymous when someone (like the feds) is actually interested in investigating you.

Ah ok.
I wouldn't consider myself a libertarian by any stretch of the means, but I do think it's pretty fascinating to see how the technology has allowed those with the "no-regulation" ideology to further that particular ideal without direct confrontation. They're just going around the banks and the government.


Which particular examples come to mind?


Well maybe someday someone will have the ability to keep it all in btc and not convert to fiat, but not at this point, so the exchange fees aren't something to ignore. However they're still much less than credit card fees; the fee to convert to fiat is somewhere between &lt;0%-1% depending on the situation. The transaction fees are actually optional, though if you don't put a transaction fee it could take your transaction an hour or two to be verified by the network. 5-10 cents should be enough for a quick transaction.
A lot of the independent retailers in my area don't take credit/debit cards because the 5% or so in fees isn't worth it for them. Luckily they all have ATMs for me to get cash out so I can pay a $2.00 fee just to get a Gatorade :-)

Coinbase is doing a hell of a lot for bitcoin's growth, in my opinion. 
Waiting five days for cash to clear a Dwolla account to transfer into an exchange house or depositing money into a stranger's bank account you meet on localbitcoins - these are not viable long-term solutions for the growth of Bitcoin.
Honestly I don't understand why so many in this subreddit rip on them. They're the only ones offering the convenience of instant buys, while taking on a lot of risk to do so. They're also incentivizing merchants to accept bitcoin.
But yet instead of giving them any credit all I see are comments like "WTF I want to buy 100 BTC instantly!" and hipster programmers who think they can do a better job.

I agree, Ulbricht's case is not open and shut. It looks more and more to me like his lawyer will have a lot to work with, and now that he's got a good one his chances of walking have increased.

I fear this becoming a discussion of semantics...anyways to get away from that, my point (which I made in a snarky fashion, I admit) was that I felt you were being too dismissive of the OP's point without tsaying why it was you disagreed, highlighted your instructions to "read a book", implying that only in books could factual/insightful information surface.
Also my point is that since economics is more theory/philosophy than proven scientific fact, much of what has been written is exactly that: theory/philosophy. Hence my uneloquent comment about people "making shit up as they go".

1. I can see how they could set up a situation to make someone act how they want. However I really have a hard time seeing myself being pushed into ordering a hit on someone to protect my business interests (especially when I was already a multi-millionaire after 2 years of running a website). If I genuinely felt that my life was threatened, maybe. 
2. I agree, it would mean he's not actually a murderer. But not much better than one.
3. True. There is a chance that the whole thing is a fabrication, and he'll have the ability to defend himself. The fact that it goes against his stated principles is something worthy of consideration, however it's totally possible that all the money and power corrupted him like it's done so many others in the past. He'd have no incentive to back away from them publically though, and he was probably savvy enough to realize that they were helpful to his brand's image.
