In a way he would be respecting his acquaintance's wishes by not outing him as satoshi

TLDR; Jameson Lopp thinks we need to run full nodes on a raspberry pi.

... come on you're smarter than that, 50 btc in 2012 was worth a LOT less then 12.5 btc today.

Boy you sure cracked the case Sherlock,  we need high fees in 2017 just to keep the miners, the block reward isn't enough, it totally isn't the case that the fees are needed to get transactions on to LN.

Read about CW's acquaintance who lives in Florida and passed away. If he was satoshi and Craig knew it then he knows he can claim the title and his friend who was satoshi can't speak up

You are wrong, bitcoin has not and does not today need full blocks people will still use bitcoin and miners will still mine bitcoin even if the blocks are not full. All I said was that people will not use Lightning Network without full blocks but that they will use Bitcoin without full blocks. What you are talking about is a fee market being good for bitcoin in the future and arguably a needed incentive for miners. That however is not today and so you are wrong, unless you are somehow speaking to us from the future, but the rest of us are living in the present.

So not segwit?

On the off-chance that I haven't been shadow banned yet here in North Korea, I'll respond. 
Lightning channels are inconvenient you would only set one up if fees are high, but if blocks are empty or near empty then fees will be low (and often 0 as long as you don't mind possibly waiting a few blocks). Hopefully now you realize that LN only costs "waay less" if the on-chain blocks are full.

The mining rewards are still more than large enough today to incentivize PoW mining. Bitcoin is still young there is still time to develop a fee market later.

I'm not saying full blocks are "Bad". But to say full blocks are needed isn't correct, I was using Bitcoin in 2012 without full blocks and it was working for me just fine. Perhaps you are trying to say full blocks is a natural occurrence of increased transaction demand? Or maybe you are trying to say that a fee market is healthy for Bitcoin? either of which sound correct to me, but that it "needs" full blocks doesn't sound correct.

It depends on how high fees are for on chain use. For the average user there won't be an incentive to create channels unless fees are high. But maybe some large bitcoin payment service providers will be using them.
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:58:23
No, it doesn't need a fork, but it does need full blocks. No one will use it unless blocks are full (look at litecoin).
Edit: so many sensitive pussies in here, can't say anything factual that doesn't fit with the approved narrative; what happened to rational dialog here? I'm not throwing any bombs just discussing the incentives behind opening LN channels.

Please try to keep up, miners have already agreed to increasing the block size (HK and again in NY).

I've been using and working on bitcoin projects since 2012; I understand fee markets perfectly well. Yet you seem unwilling to understand that LN requires full blocks or you do understand it and engage in shutting down that truth from being discussed here. Full blocks are not needed today (or in the near future) for people to use bitcoin. You can't seem to put up an reasonable argument against that huh? Don't feel bad that is because its true so you're not going to be able to argue effectively against it.

It would be useful in the b2b world (business doing regular/frequent tx with each other) and also for centralized institutions (Exchanges, Coinbase, etc.) moving coins around (hot wallet -&gt; cold wallets). 
It would also be useful to the organization that developed it and got the network to start relying on it before 2nd tx layers are necessary, thus beating out any competition from other secondary layers. They can then have their experts hired by various companies and institutions to setup LN nodes for them, raking in nice consulting fees.

*cough Blockstream
Seriously though this is a battle between 2 BTC entities vying to have the most power. The users and economic entities will always be decentralized, and today the developers and mining are centralized. If one managed to decentralize the other they'll have most of the power and will be calling the shots. The devs and miners will have to agree to share power and compromise or the other option is to force a chain split, where blockstream calls the shots on one coin, and the Chinese miners call the shots on the other coin. It looks like the devs (Adam/Luke) are unwilling to share power and compromise (the miners tried to compromise both at HK and NY) and so there will be a chain split. The users and economic actors will sort themselves out across the two new chains.
