how long do you have to wait to receive your btc? i use coinbase i always have to wait 7 days. I use citizens federal credit union for my bank but for some reason it won't accept my debit from my checking account. I can only use my bank account. if i open an account with Bank Of America will i still have to wait a week to receive or deposit anything on coinbase?
