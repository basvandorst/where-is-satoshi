Binance, with coins with higher volume is like Kraken on Dec 17. Gets frozen and lagging much worse. I only got 1 error on kraken for the last 3 months while binance is getting worse imo

I bought software and some friends buy digital goods, too

Someone's been buying 0.006 btc-€ every second or two on kraken for days, now s/he's selling the same way.

Amazing, brother. I'm so sharing this and I hope I could do something for my friends or family in the future if they needed. 
Just made my day!

Thanks. Is that list for the latest segwit implementation or just segwit in general?

If you can get away with not paying the debt for now, debt is cheap. Btc is not getting that much cheaper. I guess your brain will stop when it considers the price is too high to go deeper. Same for the debt. Trust your brain.

I like to go and take a look to the twitter feed and responses of the people I don't know. Little to nothing to see there but insults and childish tweets and comments.
Not the kind of people I'd like to be friends with so I dug some more to find out it's also not the kind of people I'd like to follow on twitter. I see all those haughty, high-horse, self-proclaimed thought leaders as future forkers.
I'll skip the episode and save me some precious afternoon free time. Why should we listen to this guy again? I guess everybody has an opinion on Brexit but what is he, an economist or something?

I've read about it, never gave it a try as I heard there were some security issues but I think it was some phishing stuff not a hack? thanks

TL;TR How to dig your own cryptograve.

Thanks, really helpful comment. I'll think it through.

I know my funds are safe but they're of no use when I can't access them whenever I please.
I love the "be your own bank" unfortunately "my own bank" is locked up and I have to figure out how to get in and be able to even receive money. 
I have another nano s as a back up but in NO WAY i'm buying the latest computer just to deal with some Ledger company decission to not support my software specs just because I don't want to go buy a brand new pc just to find out it doesn't work either a year from now. 
I don't like my btc on exchanges and now I can't even transfer to my wallet. Simple as that.
Mass adoption my a\*s if so.

You can't install Live on W7. It's the Chrome Bitcoin Ledgerwallet  app that crashes when loading up. It worked 6-8 months ago.
Will check Electrum, thanks.

Correct. Even Ethereum discussed the DAO thing and voted if I remember correctly. Not following eth so I may be wrong but this bcash sh¡tshow is just nuts.
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:10:39
Damn, that did it!
Thanks a lot, man!
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:24:11
It's possible and some pools process them but the fees also help securing the network by supporting the miners.
@_date: 2019-05-25 10:07:04
That's how consensus works at bcash? Two parties reorganizing the chain without even discussing it with their community? Much decentralized then.

Magic internet money always ends up escalating magically.

And the bitcoin twitter account, and the btc reddit, and shares in crypto businesses, and so on. They would already be dead and buried by now.
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:11:59
Nice to know, thank you.
Time to get into Linux. Should have been there long ago.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:04:49
Update: Fired up Electrum and when I was in the installation process I got: "Electrum fails to create the wallet" or something. 
Closed Electrum, rebooted, got the message: Failed to execute script\_run\_electrum.
It seems technology won't work whenever you need it.
I'm quite a tech savy man and this is nothing but headache. I've been a hardcore BTC supporter for years but now I'm losing faith in this whole stuff... Mass adoption my a\*s.
(Sorry I'm SO pissedoff)
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:11:31
I'm selling my 2 Nano's. I had enough of this complex upgrading, non-backwards compatible, unreliable stuff. Not trusting my money to this nonsense.
Thanks anyways.
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:09:34
Not Windows 7 compatible.
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:37:26
Thank you for the detailed response.

**Extremely** unlikely but Bitcoin doesn't care either way. You shouldn't either.
Fear is the most powerful emotion. I guess he's doing something wright at exploiting that from the concerns some people have here.
