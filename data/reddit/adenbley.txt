yeah, we can just use the mtgox rate, whatever last trade is.
is there really no fee schedule with amazon?  what about the cc fees that they have to pay?  or is it only ach(bank transfer) funded?  we can pm in like 10 hours, if that is alright.

publicity stunt that cost them all of their miners.  if they give the btc back, i'd say it wasn't foul play.
@_date: 2012-08-13 20:20:42
it is not a bad thing, there is no reason we need an audit of money.  even cash is starting to become traceable, and that is ridiculous.  part of living free is that you can not put limits on other people either.  dollars count in any election, but not near as much as the manipulation of the people by the powerful.  i would bet that you could have a winning candidacy without any ads, fliers or mailers if you could get fox, msnbc, abc, npr, and nyt to cover you as much as they cover the other candidates.  for example i did not see an ad, or anything for cain, but he was sure pushed on the networks for a week or 2.
tl;dr money helps in an election, but the RNC/DNC/media help more.

that would be the way to get a ton of business.  perhaps couple this with the ability to shred records once all parties are satisfied.  this is one of the things that make gun shows so nice.  you can walk in with a pile of cash and anonymously walk out with an almost complete gun.

@_date: 2012-07-07 07:07:37
my wallet is on a different computer, so it would have to wait until tomorrow i'm -6 gmt.  my only fear is chargebacks, but you look like you have a reddit history, and spend time with the ancaps, so i'd be willing to risk it.  i'm looking for 0%.
@_date: 2012-06-14 03:30:00
$5 is a good point to be at and is around the price to mine, which would just make sense.  if the price goes down, people mine less, the difficulty drops, and it is now cheaper to mine, but it doesn't scale going up;  when it was $40/btc it still cost in the single digits to mine since there were no more miners that could be turned on.

good primer, but i would point out that pass phrases do not require random words.if you just picked a sentence from somewhere (or off the top of your head) the chances of it being guessed are very low, even if you use all lower case, no numbers and no punctuation.
to show this just try copying some phrase from anywhere and put it in quotes into google.  most likely it wouldn't have appeared anywhere else on the internet.  picking a random word is worth 3.7 lower case letters, so a sentence of 7 words would be equivalent to a 27 letter password, sure they could do shortcuts, like one verb per sentence, but whatever.  throw in a proper noun if you are worried about it getting cracked.
@_date: 2012-09-17 16:30:39
could you explain why?  a single word would be dictionary attacked, but (all lower case, but with tense taken into account) you are looking at about 300k words.  so for 5 words you are looking at 2.43e27 combinations.  i do not see anyway that this could be attacked.  please advise.  if you knew what the article was drawn from then yes, it could be attacked, for example the bible only has 700000 words in it, so using your favorite phrase from it would be a bad idea, without throwing in something of your own, but then i don't see the method for breaking it, "for god so loved the planet earth that he made ants".

alright it's been 6 hours, where is the picture?
@_date: 2012-09-17 20:15:41
so my example 6 posts up would be unbreakable with this method because i used the words "earth", "planet", and "ants".  it's alright if you don't believe me, i can live with that.  if you can find a source that says a pass phrase using a sentence is worse than a 12 char password then i'll eat my words.

you guys should also change the layout/names so that they don't all run together.
@_date: 2012-08-18 07:04:18
also they add liquidity to the market. speculators are the reason there are so many orders on mtgox, and thus the reason you can buy and sell whenever you want to.
@_date: 2012-08-01 03:36:23
the problem is that the person could people can charge back even if they receive the box of matches, and they do all of the time.  in the case of theft all of the things bought with a cc are charged back.  problem with bitcoin is that stolen cards can buy them, and once they are delivered someone else is out the money since they are pretty much untraceable.

yeah, the whole article was a series of jabs at bitcoin.  it's great that someone wanted to cover bitcoin, and learned about it, but fuck this guy.  maybe (hopefully) he lost his shirt with btcst.
@_date: 2012-08-13 21:16:34
when you look back at this article it will be important to know how much value was associated with the transaction.  it would be like i was talking about 100oz of silver, if it was recently then it would be $3k, if it was 10 years ago it would be $300, if there was a heist or something it is important to know the value.  like the bitcoinica heist was 18,547 BTC, but if the same amount was taken today it would be more than 2x the value that it was.
@_date: 2012-08-09 20:12:11
i do not see anything on their subreddit about sponsoring (i know it is on their site, but still hard to find), and they should really put the bitcoin address on the sidebar, perhaps with a link to weusecoins or some primer on bitcoin (this would gain you much love from the btc community).
perhaps could add you guys to our sidebar as well, but your address has to be visible on your page.

doesn't deflationary mean that it's value would grow, and stuff would cost less over time?  so in that case you would want to save up, even at zero intrest, unlike USD.

i'm kind of surprised that they do not sell the btc off right away.
@_date: 2012-09-06 15:34:50
because the up front cost is so high i do not think that we will see it reach power costs again.  there will also be efficiency gains along with Thash/s gains with every generation.  think of it this way, if you bought a mini-rig for $30k you would want it to be paid off plus around %10/year ROI minimum before it is obsolete.  that is a lot to pay off, and i don't think the electricity (1200W) will ever come close to the cost of the equipment.
@_date: 2012-08-15 16:46:53
they get liquidated and the market gets a [short squeeze](  it happened every once and a while with bitcoinica, if i remember right there was some dick who would really fuck with the market because he was holding so much btc he could force a short squeeze.

@_date: 2012-08-19 17:43:55
this is not really a bubble bursting, at least in the normal sense.  one or a few big players are forcing the bulk of these changes, and some people, like op, are getting out because the risk is unknown.  this guy apparently held 500k+ btc and has sold off 150k (just numbers i have seen thrown around), so people are probably correct for wanting to get out.  i'm going to hang in there though, see what happens with asic mining and the halving.
@_date: 2012-06-27 16:07:24
the tax is redistributed to the rest of the freicoin users.  so if you had 2 accounts you would claim 2x the tax.
say the tax is 0.5 BTC per user, and you had 1M BTC, you would lose 44k BTC and gain 0.5 BTC.  now if you had 1M freicoin accounts with 1 btc in them, you would still lose 44kBTC, but you would gain 500K BTC.

thank you for offering btc services. is there a large difficulty with accepting btc as a payment method, instead of requiring the voucher step? for example, 2 bars + shipping to US is 10.2 pounds, so a 10 pound voucher wouldn't work, and a 20 would be too much.
@_date: 2012-07-13 21:12:26
this is much more likely.  
@_date: 2012-08-19 07:01:03
according to [bitcoin watch]( there are just under ten million bitcoin out there.  a small of that is in the market (to be sold), some of it are in people's wallets (like my btc) and will not be traded too often, and some is probably lost to the world (some nerd dabbled in it back in the day and lost his wallet due to a format or just a delete).  
it you look at mtgoxlive.com you will see on the left side are the buy orders.  and you see that if someone sold off 50k btc right now it would fill buy orders all the way down to $8.50, so there would be no one willing to buy for more than $8.50 and so that would be the new price.
@_date: 2012-08-01 04:00:14
i would like to see an edit to this post saying that the 50 have been used up (probably by someone gaming the system).

@_date: 2012-05-18 15:01:15
the whole point of bitcoin is that it is no longer necessary to know the identity of the people you are dealing with, and you don't even have to trust them unless you are the buyer.  the problem is that with ach, creditcards, paypal, and dwolla, the customer can chargeback and then the USD is lost.  so they need to trust that you are who you say you are, and if you make a fake chargeback they can take you to court.
@_date: 2012-09-17 17:15:10
i agree that it is greatly reduced, but it is still quite high, and if you didn't know a specific publication you would have to get it into the memory.  how many passwords do you think could be checked per second using words and rules? 1M? that is still 7e13 years...  so you would need to be able to check 7e19 per second (never going to happen), to search the whole space in one year.

right now the total hashing rate is 20T, so it would only take 3 million years using all of the bitcoin hashing power, and that is assuming that it can create and check a new password using the same amount of cpu time as it takes to create and check a hash.  you can't count asics either, since it would be prohibitively complex to do this kind of checking.
@_date: 2012-07-14 00:36:44

this is a self post, but let's for a second pretend that it was in an article in the NYT.  then it would be in dollars, if it were in the guardian it might be in gbp or euros.  
the dollar is also the best to tie it to because, like it or not, the volume traded in usd was 15x the next currency (euros) today, which means that liquidity and thus "fair price" are best in usd.
@_date: 2012-05-18 21:42:26
but only 50% of the transactions.  in a situation like ebay sellers are rated, and are trusted.  for example i bought a monitor from korea, sure i had the protection that paypal affords me, but the seller also had like 14k positive reviews, and i would have payed in btc if i could have.  the people who usually abuse a payment system are the people who do crap like claiming that they never received, or that item was broken, or just do a chargeback for whatever reason.
tl;dr, i would use btc for people i trust, and would have no personal issues using it with newegg, amazon, or highly rated ebay users.
@_date: 2012-08-19 18:50:51
all about volume.  look at the walls on the mtgoxlive.com chart, and then ask yourself what a 150k sale would do.  well, that is what happened.  now that those sales have happened people are getting freaked out, and rightfully so, since the people who did this could quite likely do it more.  so now the price will drop because no one wants to buy when the future is unknown (your observation as well).
edit: 7.58, wow, you did well op.
@_date: 2012-08-17 06:27:00
there is no reason (unless you are a merchant) to only deal in cash and use btc as the transfer method.  keep some on hand, like you would a silver piece.

i think the typical way is to make a "live cd" on a usb drive.  you can find a guide to do this for ubuntu pretty easily.  they you install the bitcoin client, generate a wallet, write down a couple of receive addresses and shut it down.  if anything happened to that usb drive you would lose everything.  i just encrypt the wallet and keep it on dropbox.  i also use blockchain for some storage.

my suggestion would be to build your main computer around the 2 cards and use it for gaming or whatever when they aren't mining.  this is a shitty time for BC, hopefully it won't last, but it might.  the upside is that if people start jumping ship they will lower the difficulty which would make it more profitable.
i'll add to that that winter is coming, and that 400W goes right into the air, it is like any other 400W electrical heater.

the most private thing on the internet with the least private.  what a swell idea.
@_date: 2011-08-30 16:49:44
if you already have a computer running all of the time it is only like 200W extra to run a 6950 at 100% (assuming it is running at tdp, which it isn't).  using the calculator this is $1.03/day after power costs.
so it will not be profitable for 250 days or whatever you paid for a card, but if you need a video card anyway, then this becomes close to a no-brainer.  this is also for the low exchange (which might get worse yet, but might get better).

if you run out of money then you are in the market for nothing anyway.  this is not a failure of the free market it is because of shortcomings that mtgox will have to go through many changes to prove to the users that they are worthy.  there are plenty of alternatives to mtgox, and if all of those started sucking then more would pop up.
