What’s a good wallet?

This post was pretty spot in except for the part that fiat currency will have to be very undermined/useless and the current regime has completely fallen apart when BTC reaches 100k-250k. That wont be until like 500k+

Hey retard Obama gifted Dump a beautiful economy.  Obama is known as the deporter in chief. He has deported more illegals than any President ever. Trump isn’t even close at the pace he’s going. Only thing Trump has done is tweet dumbass shit, collude with Russia, have 4 of his associates arrested, and called legitimate new sources Fake News because they disagree with him. Get your head out of your ass and come back to reality. MAGA= more are getting arrested.

@_date: 2017-12-08 22:19:05
Does this mean almost zero fee instant transactions when it comes to transferring BTC into private wallets as well? or just when buying/selling? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:08:26

@_date: 2017-11-10 01:08:51
Divided the community. BTC will stand but I feel like there will be more resistance if BTC doesn’t fix their issues.

I believe an exchange like Coinbase has a limit of 10,000. So if you wanted to withdraw 1 million it would take 100 withdrawals.

Bitcoin is straight up Capitalist. You are essentially your own bank. No middle man and no government overwatch. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:12:08

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:42

So what does this mean? This cannot be good at all? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:31:56
So you’re saying the BTC price will level off? At what price? I think the demand of BTC will always be there and if the price just drops people are going to keep buying it.
