Bcore has a nice ring to it. 
You should just embrace it. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:20:22
You should just get out while you can.

If bcash is so inferior then why are you guys stressing out?  
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:56:45
LOL read the fuckin thing.
This is 100% proof that tether is solvent. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:07:08
You're either lying or a paranoid retard. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:05:25
None of them are safe.
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:19:01
I love this guy.
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:47:30
Yeah, ignore the content of the article and make up some conspiracy theory about its timing - good thinking
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:03:03
what is bitcoin a thing for then 
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:54:20
why would it ever go back up 
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:35:21
perfect sucker 
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:31:38
Yup, you got it all figured out.
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:19:58
smart guy right here fellas.  No way does bitcoin ever fall below 6k
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:38:58
well from here it seems more people are losing interest in bitcoin than gaining.  most people I try to get into it have already heard about it from the bull run and want nothing to do with it.  the price is just as likely to keep going down as it would to go back up, right? 
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:38:38
LOL it's okay he doesn't either
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:48:34
LOL don't be crazy.  
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:07:09
Ultimate bagholder right here
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:02:11
If you'd sent BTC he'd have lost 11% in the past 12 hours too
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:29:29
You only lose if you sell!
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:58:39
Universal adoption here we come 
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:36:38
The market is so obviously manipulated.  All your "research" didn't make that clear to you?  Just look at any trading graph over a 3 day stretch.  
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:36:47
There is hardly any demand for bitcoin outside of this sub lol
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:41:22
"Bitcoin will undoubtedly coexist with current currencies"
Or ya know it could just die.  
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:24:52
The internet had obvious benefits and use cases.
What does bitcoin have that other services don't already provide?
In another way - people buy thing because they either want or need them.  I will skip the want portion because nobody really wants to buy bitcoin the way you want to buy a pepsi.  What NEED does bitcoin satisfy that some other product already available doesn't meet? 
@_date: 2018-07-02 13:50:55
What a disingenuous question. 
You have no idea what the bottom is for bitcoin and there's no guarantee if will ever go back up.  
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:48:59
Yeah bitcoin is sooooo much cheaper until your account gets hacked and you lose 1/4 of your business profits and have no recourse. 
Nobody wants to use bitcoin in the real world.  If they did - they would.  
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:47:04
baby steps baby steps baby steps
It's been 10 freaking years.  If bitcoin was sooooo great you'd think people would start using it.  What do you think makes something a good product?  Product succeed because their benefits are obvious to consumers.  Bitcoin will never succeed because you need an hour lecture to people just to talk them into even considering it and even then you need to throw in some "wow banks are soooo evil" just to convince them because its merits alone aren't worth using. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:44:30
Facebook and Google blew up and were gaining new users exponentially... merchants are dropping bitcoin because it isn't effective...
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:55:10
I really hope you're joking.  Wtf did I just read
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:37:00
Most likely if you're selling right now it's to stop the bleeding and you never want to think about bitcoin again.
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:42:38
Why would the government want to give up control of its own currency? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:41:36
Or, if cryptos are so effing great then why do you have to have a half hour discussion with someone to convince them they're work looking into?  
@_date: 2018-12-10 04:31:08
yeah cause an 85% drop from 1k and 20k are totally relevant comparisons.  JESUS wtf are you guys smoking
@_date: 2018-12-09 03:58:09
Yeah!  Everyone is loving getting rektd with 90% losses.  Fun!!!
