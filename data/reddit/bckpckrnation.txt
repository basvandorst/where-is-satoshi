The point is that the govt can't print more Bitcoin so they have to depend on people actually paying taxes (if we're in a bitcoin economy) which is harder for them to rely on and therefore budgets need to be more carefully planned and transparency will be better on all fronts.

Basically, say Bitcoin (or block chain technology) becomes the predominant currency. Now say the US govt relies on its tax income + debt to pay its bills. Since it cannot print more money, it's clear that it must either raise taxes, reduce spending or go into more debt. We've already established that more debt is almost always their answer. With me?
However, as their debt rises, they have no way of printing more money (Bitcoin) to pay that debt. So you say...take on more debt, right?
Well, with the supply of Bitcoin being limited, they can only borrow so much....because they, nor anybody else, can print more. Plus, as their obligations grow with finite tax income, people will be wary of lending their bitcoin to the government. Would you lend money to the government of their was little chance of getting it back?
Eventually...their debt obligations will be larger than their ability to pay and borrow more, so they will default. This means creditors don't get paid and nobody lends to the government anymore.
Default has never happened by the US Government purely because they can always print more money and take on more debt.
In a Bitcoin world, this would force governments to reduce their spending. Governments hate that, especially the reserve currency.
This is also the reason for a lot of war. As governments are put under financial strain, they're confronted with needing to come up with resources to control/sell to fun their practices. However...war costs money...so they are just simply limited on options.
As blockchain technology improves and people seek alternatives to wall streets corruption of the dollar via heavy lobbying, governments will slowly lose traction, even if they don't see it at first.

Because wallets aren't like bank accounts. If you don't pay your taxes, the govt can't seize Bitcoin transfers or Bitcoin wallets. 
Your quote implies that there would be some form of physical link between a specific wallet and a person. That will not happen because wallets can easily be created in privacy.

Predictions are always funny to me.

Haha good point

Any investment advice that starts with "Dude" should immediately lead to someone getting kicked in the nuts. And I'm not volunteering.
@_date: 2017-04-16 23:34:37
Damn, good point. Thanks for that.
@_date: 2017-04-25 01:13:23
Oh gotcha, didn't notice that sliver until you pointed it out.

When was there a surplus? Probably before my enlightened years.
@_date: 2017-04-25 00:30:25
It's slowly happening. I've visited a couple different countries now and it's surprising how less dependent they are on oil and dollars. A lot of them rely on electric and just use less resources generally.
The interesting thing is...if the dollar crashed, they would barely be phased. Since there's such artificial demand for dollars, a lot of countries can't afford to have a lot of dollars so they use barter or their own local currency. If the dollar crashed, they would hardly feel it.

Yea, you basically summed it up. People resist change even when it's in their best interest. People fear the unknown.
Fortunately, with enough pain and suffering, people look for alternatives. At one point people questioned cash and only wanted gold/silver. Now that we're outgrowing that model, crypto is gaining traction.
Those older ladies are exactly why things change slowly. They're stuck their ways even if their way isn't working.

Any idea what leads to shut down? Where's the line?
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:05:48
Agreed. Colder climates certainly offer more challenges in that regard.
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:05:13
My point is that most people that live in other less developed countries/cities don't depend on currency. The way we live is not the way they live. They depend on their livestock, farming and the electricity from solar panels. Their assets are their farm equipment, family owned land, tools, local relationships with other farmers and perhaps a few months rations. The only currency they may have is from any remaining trade surplus that's a luxury but not a necessity. If the US economy collapsed, they would hardly feel it. 
The USA doesn't affect others lives like we think it does. It's very smart of these farmers too. If I was a farmer in South America, I would rather rely on the success of my efforts on the farm, rather than some investment bank and/or government pricks in the USA.

It'll be rigged like everything else in the world other than Bitcoin.

The price goes up and down. Someone is tooting Marks horn that he had any influence on anything.

Any luck? This is interesting to me.

Better yet, give your lawyer access to real keys to a legit safe that nobody knows about. In that, have a USB or paper with the keys. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:04:10
Damn. That's a powerful statement that I haven't thought about before. I like it!
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:54:47
Yes, definitely true that financial privacy should be a right. Today tech companies, governments, courts and financial companies essentially feel they they can decide on our level of privacy. Bitcoin changes that game and forces them to accept our true privacy. It's beautiful.

See my other comment below. Your web history is tracked in your Gmail account. If you used Gmail, you can refer back in time to what you searched at that time. That will be telling!
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:14:02
Do you know the email address that the account was listed under for the website that the bitcoins were stored at? If yes, was it a Gmail account? Please note, I am not asking for the actual email address.

Sell when it hits $250k.

If you use gmail, all of your search history is tracked and connected to your email address. If you were logged into GMail when you were browsing the web for bitcoin stuff, you can see which web-pages you looked at. Was it a Gmail email address?

Not sure if "smash" is the right word (yet), but ok.
