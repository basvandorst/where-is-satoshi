You can have all your coins super secure, but every time there is a major theft the course crashes. You might say that you don't care much about the BTC vs. USD conversion rate but those crashes scare a lot of people away from it.

That’s an ICO management and promotion company. Just a heads up cause you guys usually dismiss that type of thing :)

Don't hate on other coins and be a maximalist, let them do their thing and everyone can learn from their mistakes.

Works with stock and makes for much more interesting bios. I say that as a hotelier and chocolate factory co owner.

He doesn't hate reddit, he has an account and posts from time to time. He knows the type of "questions" would be coming and that they are not helpful for any discussion.

Came to say that, not sure why this gets downvotes. Exposing something like windows into to world via network seems like a bad idea. Also can you even remote admin Windows 10 via ssh?

The nerdy ponce is gonna get called when the box got hacked and all the money is gone and nobody knows why.

A bitcoin cost one bitcoin, why even bother with the local currency at this rate of inflation?

When the world ends, how do you use bitcoin? Does it work without a functioning internet? They are probably just talking shit but maybe there is something interesting about it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:44:14
I have no idea what happens but as an outsider posts like this make me stay way from it.

Not when the other guy has zero.

Did he? Cause he also wrote a book on Ethereum.

Genuine question: why don't they do it? Or if they don't why doesn't someone build that hash power and do it?
@_date: 2019-06-20 11:35:31
Sounds like an excuse. Why would he be able to say that now but not back then?

i had tears in my eyes like last time with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:04:50
Fair enough, in that case, don't say "more than you".
@_date: 2019-02-07 03:40:00
That's not how markets work. You need people at 900k thinking that it goes to 1M. It's all psychology. Not saying this can't happen but it's more than simple multiplication.

Minings a race toward the bottom reward wise for each generation of hardware. A one time fee to be setup to keep mining just doesn't reflect realities, cloud or hardware mining, doesn't matter.

That's not true, i think everyone knows that a busting bubble means that most of the companies from that time aren't around anymore. Why else would you call it a bubble?
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:03:48
The best thing about crypto is that you don't automatically become a public figure with growing wealth. Other ways to gain wealth will often raise your public profile at the same time.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:21:45
Yeah, it's amusing to see those "ima bitcoin millionaire, ama" type of posts
@_date: 2019-02-10 09:22:57
should just stick your rigs into a container and ship them to wherever the price is lowest.

All that matters is what people think it’s worth. Dollar wins I’d say.

We learned nothing from the last crash.
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:41:35
Would it be so bad to act as an agency, not an actual manufacturer? I mean it’s in the name already.
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:05:31
Or even gravity

Does it show how great Bitcoin is or just how bad transfers work in the US between banks? I've just transferred 10k for 0.09 and it took what felt like an hour from UK to Germany thanks to SEPA. In Thailand I can send between banks for a similar low fee and it's even faster. Don't wanna knock Bitcoin, I'm using it regularly for transfers where those offers aren't available. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:48:19
Bit ironic they didn't do an ICO.
@_date: 2018-12-24 12:11:33
Okay but it's that like saying "this is the best iPhone we ever made"?

"I bought them all" 
Fails to name a single one besides Bitcoin. Right.

Also looks bad for the organizers, they just boasted how many talks they reject for every one they accept. There is this general “blockchain sucks and needs to go away” vibe you get from certain people around the cc congress.
