Waiting 4 days for confirmations, was like this about a month ago too. I think i understand the technical reason why this is happening (I think); network load vs fee i paid.
BUT. 
1) This is not really that much of an improvement from the FIAT banking system;- pay to transfer money and it takes ages anyway.
2) Doesn't it mean that its going to be harder to deal with bitcoins? If it takes so long to confirm them. Is this situation with long confirmations going to get better?
I'm not an entire noob, but there is probably more going on than i know/understand.

Well, the transaction costs were quite low and it was historically very quick. That is my point, as things progress we seem to be losing some of the benefits, no?
Its not a political question, more of a "are the alt coins going to take over slow old bitcoin" sooner rather than later. ... or are we likely to see things like Segwit.

Coinbase are pretty shit as an exchange. They are terrible at customer service when their systems fail. Tried using them with several people (all legit) they fail then suck at anything more. Really avoid them if you care about your money!!!!

Not parroting, recounting actual experience. Who brought up corporate america? I had no idea about coinbase until i used them. I only used them because they partnered with my wallet provider. Then on first, second and every subsequent use they failed, both with me and other people who have the same wallet provider: my brother, in the same house at the time. I think you are a bit paranoid and I'm not sure why you dont like people offering an opinion on things they have actually done in real life.. maybe you need to get off the internet and go outside.

I only have a small amount.. put $500 in about a month ago. When it got to $850 I took $350.
I now own less btc but they went back to the original $500. Today they're worth $630.
If I take another $200 in the next few days then my entire investment is free, I'm extracting the original but the value remains.
I am not qualified to give financial advice but I think the price will level off or dip soon so plan to buy back in then.

On the plus side, Lloyd's just signed a 10 year outsourcing deal with IBM so all IT is going to India .... You dodged a bullet there!
