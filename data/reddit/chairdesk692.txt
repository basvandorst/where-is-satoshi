Yes, I can use the first layer, as long as I'm fine with paying 25$ plus for my coffee. So that's not an option.
As for not having a clue, have you even looked at the LN white paper? It asks for 133MB blocks to work.

What proven lies? I provided sources, here is one for the fee I cited.

Or large nodes? Run by corporations and banks?

Bitcoin Cash will scale in accordance with Moores law, which means little to no centralization

Median fee is just over 5$. Down from a few weeks ago, but still super expensive. Other currencies like Ethereum have proved its possible to have 3x the volume but with lower fees. It's because Core is purposely crippling Bitcoin to force people to use sidechains, which Blockstream is patenting and making money off of.
Most sane community members aren't. Core is, because it would destroy their revenue stream. LukeJr is even contemplating 300kb blocks! 
As for SegWit, it is barely being used and has serious risks and issues of its own.

So... Obvious centralized hubs?

How am I a troll? What are you talking about lol. looks like centralized hubs to me. I'd be happy to change my position if you can explain to me why what I am seeing is not centralization.
