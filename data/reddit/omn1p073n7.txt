Because you think 'fox news' is the source for anti-fed sentiment? Republicams thi k t9 be a fed critic is to beg for negative interest rates to make their debt spirals feel lighter. Lmao look at their 08 coverage they became socialists overnight. Privatized profits, socialized losses is the fascist american economic system of today. (I use the term literally, the marriage of state and corporate power).

Ive been there done that. Had a shift card. Bought all kinds of shit with BTC and LTC.  Sure wish i had held it a while longer as i could have paid off all my debt and mortgage mostly. Spent 4 bitcoin on my honeymoon when btc was around 1k. What's worse is it turned me into a HODLer which also caused me to be too shy ti sell. Had 30k worth or NEO when it mooned. I do conservative trades now though, definitely learned how not to do both extremes.

Ross Ulrich did nothing wrong. A marketplace of consenting adults is not something I would be proud of taking down. Ransomware and terrorism sure, but the drug war? Really hard to take the moral high ground on that one.

Once the IRS lets me line item what I pay for that argument might stand. I don't use the missiles used to slaughter civilians in Yemen. I don't use the trillion dollars spent on 20 years of nation building in Afghanistan. In fact, I don't use the vast majority of what my government squanders my money on.  I would prefer if I werent financing the highly immoral drug war/mass incarceration of non violent offenders. Social security will be defunct before I can use it. I could go on. Stop pretending paying taxes makes you altruistic. Its a lazy way of washing your hands of responsibility for looking out for your fellow man and it leads to tremendous destruction around the world.
 Let me pay for the actual public services I use and let the government earn its keep. Coercive taxation without accountability is just robbery with extra steps. 
I want an open source, decentralized,automated, and performance based governance that blockchain is uniquely situated to  provide. So did Satoshi Nakamoto.
