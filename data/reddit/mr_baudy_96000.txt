Yes, but so can his competitors. And the competitors won't have any $5B costs sunk into previous-gen manufacturing facility.

It's been suggested before, and from what I understand, it is basically impossible to implement in the software according to devs.

How do you browse streams? I can only see the home page with no links like that.

Got me. Hehe.

Of course he's not. People who actually work in the cryptocurrency space program computers. And are intelligent.

I don't think it's centralized if there are still thousands of full nodes that are verifying. And any one of them can be added to the IP server list of the smartphone app. I believe this was actually the intent of the creators of bitcoin, for most users to run a lite-client and to query full nodes for the transactions that most interest them.

This is an important lesson for anyone who missed it: 
Don't sell to anyone that tells you they will use the bitcoins/cash for crime. That implicates you. Walk away if the buyer says anything about shady stuff. More than likely they are Law Enforcement and will arrest you on the spot, like these two men in the article.
If you think about it, really it can be only two possibilities.
They are either law enforcement or they are not. If they are, obviously they are baiting you. If they are not, do you really want to be connected to a criminal stupid enough to talk about his crimes to a stranger? No.

Yes I agree that web wallets are not so good when it comes to control of the funds. Except the multi-sig ones that literally can't spend your money. However, the private keys are stored on-device on a lot of bitcoin smartphone wallets.
Could it potentially offer you a quick way to send money to someone without needing ATMs? Since it's your money and you hold it personally. The bank that releases you your funds at the ATM uses similar encryption technology that would guard your money using bitcoin. For example, the PIN at the ATM is also available on the most popular bitcoin wallet in the Play store.

That is definitely terrifying.
 
In that case, I guess the safest thing to do would be to carry a hidden microphone that is uploading live to your private server if your state law permits. If it's going to be a He-said, she-said game then you can provide evidence that the officers are lying, in court of course.

Thanks for the comment. 
You're right, the blockchain is getting bigger and smartphones only have so much on-board storage. But they don't have to store it locally thanks to wallets like Mycelium/Bitcoin Wallet and SPV. The user experience is pretty smooth IMO.

If lots of people buy and sell on OB, bitcoin (the only payment method on OB) becomes much more valuable. They are already holding tons of coins for sure. OB is an example of building an infrastructure for bitcoin to flourish so that they can become rich.
