on another similiar note i just tryed making a twitter twice and was rejected both times asking for my real life identity and many other things. just wasted $20 and an hour trying to set up a twitter. guess they aren't really with that bitcoin wave.

i will look into revisiting the payment page. all it said was to stay there and refresh or something like that. it said should be updated within an hour and it never updated.
as far as ross's story goes. yeah he should be free. the us goverment fucked him like they do everybody else. and i also agree that he should focus on all the wrong doings instead of admitting to being the original owner. it isnt such a great plan to win this fight. but also he knows/knew who took over the website after him. so i wouldn't say his story is entirely wrong since if did come from the man himself.

localbitcoins. cash in person.
@_date: 2019-03-19 05:06:48
yeah and i paid it and didn't get the account. that is why i came here and said scam after i read rosses story.
i dont know you and sorry for talking shit because maybe all hearsay i dont know. but what is the deal with the account? i paid and it did not unlock my account. once again sorry. could you help about that? it was you guys banned the user here today. would that have something to do with it?
@_date: 2019-03-19 06:42:08
im not sure what that reads to me. so many scammers out there and competitive marketers its hard to tell whats real anymore.
@_date: 2019-03-22 23:44:56

@_date: 2019-03-19 02:21:41

@_date: 2019-03-19 06:43:24

@_date: 2019-03-19 02:45:49

this is the guy that snitched on ross. it is all here in ross's story

@_date: 2019-03-19 02:12:53
It was .org
@_date: 2019-03-19 02:13:08
bitcointalk.org is a phishing site?

@_date: 2019-02-03 07:15:38
that looks like a pumpkin though, not an onion.
@_date: 2019-04-14 02:19:57
that was a faked death suicide. not a murder. we dont know if he does lawsuits on those yet.
@_date: 2019-04-15 04:55:16
