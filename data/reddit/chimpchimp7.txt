you should sell all your btc today, and go invest in penny stocks, or gamble.

 Sorry I wasted my time.
Whatever kind of autism you have, I hope it gets better. You can do it, I believe in you

why don't you go sell drugs in the ghetto since all you care about is making money in risky ways

Thanks for the link. I'm still interested in real people's experience, not a website.

No. You don't understand
- atms
- credit cards
- and what it means to be a client and have an account.
You must be 14 and only recently discovered what it means to have and spend money. I guess in your world money, credit, banks, accounts, and trust did not exist before 2008.
Go back to upvoting cat memes.

Weimar Republic wasn't a world power. Zimbabwe wasn't even a regional power. Soviet Union's currency was not a world reserve currency. Oil was not traded in rubles. The soviet economy was a closed eco-system.
What the U.S. has done well over the last 250 years is accept and trade with absolutely anyone and everyone, but be the dominant party in the trading relationship, and the dominance is asserted though the military.
Without a military, nobody would give a flying fuck about U.S. trade sanctions on Iran, venezuela, north korea, cuba etc. Without the military the U.S. would just be an annoying yapping dog. But see the USN is the strongest military power in the history of mankind, and they park their nuclear armed boats and subs just a hair outside another country's sovereign waters staring them down, ensuring compliance with world trade order that primarily serves U.S. interests.
If you are an American, this is great, you should be proud. If you aren't, well that's how the world works. your opinion to the contrary is quite irrelevant. The difference between China/E.U. and the USA is nuclear powered submarines, carriers and a blue water navy capable of deploying anywhere on earth in 12 hours. Without the USN, America is just a wealthier version of Brazil. And Brazil is quite irrelevant on the world stage.

Baseless assertion.

No. Prove that "Trump's mismanagement" caused the "economic slowdown".
First define slowdown. Then define mismanagement.
Provide examples of a government that has existed anywhere in the world that "managed" their economy perfectly resulting in perpetual growth.
Also explain what it means to "manage" an economy. I thought you were a free trader ? You decry "trade restrictions" and then assume that the economy can be "managed" better. 
You contradict yourself. How do you manage something without managing it, in your mind ?

No I don't. Fuck Trump

It's a little misleading because bitcoin as an asset has experienced INFLATION. If you think about how much btc you could buy with $1 in each of those years, you'll see that btc is more expensive than ever, as an asset class. 
BTC is not something you can create yourself, you have to buy it from others. And when buying it from others, you hope to be able to sell it back for a better rate. This expectation of future gains is what causes inflation in the first place. Inflation is as natural as sex and reproduction, it is the natural state of things.
