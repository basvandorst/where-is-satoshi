Dying platform? They're the fucking leader of digital game delivery and they're growing, not a dying platform...

Well, the iota network went under attack itself with a big spam of zero value transactions that pretty much fucked up the system.
It'a recovering now, but bitfinex is having problem now. 
We'll have to wait for the fix

That is because Binance gave thr fork. And it's fine, i also got them.
But the majority of my BTC is in my wallet, i would like to know how to get those

Download a wallet like Electrum.
Create a new wallet and select the "recover" options. Insert your key there and ta-da, you'll have your wallet back

yeah, no hurry. Thanks, you cleared things a bit :D

So i have to find a wallrt that support BOTH BTC and those new coins, move them there and then move BTC back right?

Nah. IOTA is not a shitcoin, it's just under attack right now. And both the major exchange in which it is traded are having problems. Let the situatiob get fixed and it will regain value
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:55:59
That's like one of the biggest exchange out here. Yeah, you can use it. Take a look into how gdax.com work, same company and same account ,but you can save a bit on fees

I would love this. Let people panic sell and buy a lot of btc. Get back in 3 years and cash out a high profit

Really useful. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:30:12
And this will keep my BTC safe in my electrum wallet, right?

Hell damn.I'll have to declare 3bilions on Black Desert Online. Imagine the taxes on that!
