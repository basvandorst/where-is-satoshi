Carnegie Mellon currently has a Bitcoin "Stu-Co", Which is basically just a student led class about cryptocurrencies, and specifically Bitcoin. The class capacity is 25, and the waitlist to get in is typically about the size of the class as well. We also have guest speakers come in to talk about the economics of Bitcoin as well and it's ability/inability to act as a new global currency.

Okay thanks! I also submitted one to Bitstamp, and so far i understand that coinbase is fraught with problems also. Do you have any other exchange suggestions?

Thanks Bitcoins!

Coinbase is a mess, and I really wish I didn't have to put up with their errors, because I get them too. Unfortunately, I am unable to verify my identity with mt Gox and BitStamp's process for transfer is tedious.
Bitcoin to USD is still an annoying process, and people are having problems like you and me all the time. As I see it, it's just one of the risks unfortunately.

Hi, these look great! But I have a quick question. What is the difference between a public and a private key? Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:45:00
What is coinbase to be used as then?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:31:39
Because it seems to be a major topic of discussion
