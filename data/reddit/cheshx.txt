üks suuremaid probleeme on praegu ikkagi tavainimesel bitcoinid kiiresti ja lihtsalt kätte saada (pean silmas minuteid/tunde mitte päevi). meedias läbi käinud btc.ee on oma tegeuvse praegu seiskanud "Due to threats issued by the Estonian police, I have STOPPED trading for an unknown period of time. " Kas bitcoinide vahetuse/kauplemise teemadel on keegi kursis, on eesti oma seisukohta muutnud ja kas ettevõtted on ikka legaalselt kaitstud kui nad bitcoini maksed vastu võtavad?
