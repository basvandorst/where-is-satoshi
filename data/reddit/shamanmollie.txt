Divide your $ invested into the current BTC value. The decimal shows the percentage of BTC you will own.
As for how much you should invest that is entirely your call. Don’t risk what you’re not willing to lose.

Search for a wallet.dat file
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:17:28
Found the trans person

The wallet.dat contains the information of any previous wallet with the respective private keys. If you find that file, Just download a wallet and put the old wallet.dat file into the folder. 
Since you can’t find that I’m really not sure if there is a means to recovering the wallet.

On mobile so it will be short and to the point.
Miners main purpose is to verify transactions and place them in the block which will then be added to the public ledger with a majority consensus. Trial and error lands a miner the correct solution, effectively winning the race and getting the block reward. The next race starts with the following block. The reward is an incentive to keep bitcoin decentralized.
As for your question regarding difficulty: each block takes 10 minutes on average to find and the difficulty increases/decreases depending on the global hash rate. When miners don’t profit enough, they leave, lessening the difficulty and increasing profits for the other miners. Constant flow to and from the pool.
