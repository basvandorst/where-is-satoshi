It also causes economic slowdown.
Why would I buy a product if it actually becomes cheaper relative to my current wealth in a few months or days.
On an individual scale that’s great, but on a large scale it would cause the economy to slow down.

Bitcoin isn’t fast.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:58:26
The scarcity argument doesn’t hold much water IMO.
It has to have value and scarcity. Value due to scarcity doesn’t really make sense.
I could create a one of a kind idol of wood, but that doesn’t mean it has value
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:53:20
What percent of the markets are they?
I’m also not sold on deflationary currencies 
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:36:15
Why do you believe Bitcoin would survive a coup or a devaluation of fiat?
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:39:17
Damn theft, giving me these roads, public safety and schools.
Look, are taxes always uses properly? Nope. 
Would I rather live in a society that had taxes? Yes

Bitcoin went up 2k
Today 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:57:11
But why Bitcoin over .... Litecoin? Vertcoin? BCash?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:17:55
How so?
The only coins I see with value that make sense are platform based coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:46
Should be. 
Doesn't mean it will be.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:51:08
May make it worthless.
I know you guys like this, but you do realize how scary and bad it is to have a generating who get fucked right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:41:27
Ethereum is processing so many more transactions already 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:18:31
If it works as a currency there is a fair chance the price would go down.
Velocity and all
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:30:35
Ethereum isn’t drowning in kittens anymore. It’s tanks. Duh.
I think Casper will improve ethereum, that said, I don’t see Ethereum breaking 5k and more like getting to 2k MAYBE. I think the Bitcoin value is a fluke for now
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:48:14
But it seems steam is pulling away from crypto completely.
At this point, I’m starting to think XRPs the only one that will make it
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:40:14
It’s not. Mixture of FOMO and brand recognition
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:23:52
I’ll give you most of that except convenience.
USD in a bank is far easier to use than crypto for like 95% of uses
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:42:03
So, since Eth actually is being used and exchanged it’s price is going down or holding.
It’s being held down by cats now
It was being held down by ICOs
Basically, there is a mass sell off of coins 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:21:00
2.5 thousand dollars in 1 day.
Nothing else you can say will stop that from being absurd
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:15:47
How many of y’all are actually using Bitcoin as a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:03:33
I get that. But at this point it seems all Bitcoin has is the hype
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:38:59
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:43:13
Eh, my fees are still 30-40 cents and I get through within 30 minutes.
It’s only if you stick to 10-20 in gas you take forever to get through. (Your CoinBase users)
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:40:57
Eth is the one coin I think will survive in the long term.
It’s changing constantly 
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:42:16
Buffet is all about low risk assets 
To him, crypto is rat poison.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:15:34
XRP is setting up independent modes (that said, I’m not in XRP)
LTC is also faster, and has cheaper rates 
Eth is available almost anywhere BTC is, is faster and cheaper to transfer
Dash... yeah, you got me. Monero maybe?
Just saying, there are alternatives that don’t have the same value, so it’s not just the utility 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:23:22
There are other coins...
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:30:24
Isn’t bitcoin based on people abandoning fiat?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:28:14
So... with this whole argument... wouldn’t someone with expandable cash be the ones most willing and able to invest in these types of ventures?
I.E. this changes nothing?
Just correct me where I’m wrong 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:34:21
No that’s awful advice
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:19:49
Sure. But in 2005, Facebook was evaluated at 580 million because of how predominate it was, and how many people used it.
2009, it was worth 39 million since interest had moved to the next thing.
With most of how we are evaluating wealth, the underlying is the same : USD.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:11:48
XRP.... Litecoin.... Ethereum... Dash.... 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:43:01
But there was a time when that argument was true of MySpace, or Yahoo. 
I’m not saying that will happen... just advising caution. 
I’m a wimp though.
This place scares me... so many people shitting on lower risk options
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:44:18
Yes, meant it did correct 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:43:40
And no one knew about Facebook for awhile while MySpace was Big.
Fun thing about speculation is... it’s speculation 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:18:41
Do we know that about transaction fees?
Doesn’t the whole economics of mining get altered as soon as all the coins are mined?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:07:15
Pretty sure if it’s over a year your income doesn’t matter
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:26:35
So, I think the block chain and decentralization has value. My question stems from Bitcoin itself over the alternatives.
That was a great explanation btw.
I personally take issue with PoW and Bitcoins current energy consumption, and the fact that it will likely only increase. 
It seems minor, but it’s important to me
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:30:14
It all seriousness, do you actually think it will be worth 500k?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:37:21
Most people would never suspect this to happen 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:13:06
But WHY is it a good investment?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:37:46
It dropped 2.5 k USD after it hit 8.
So. 
It didn’t correct, just recovered quickly 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:31:02
Personally, I think Eth is the best coin on the market. I don't think it will reach bitcoin prices, but the tech is superior. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:09:20
Yeah. I own some crypto, but it’s a tiny piece of my portfolio.
Am I going to get rich of my low cost index funds? No.
Am I setting myself up for a secure future? Yes.
This subreddit in particular has a lot of scary stuff. The pure hatred of personal finance... is odd. The whole crypto space is essentially like a couple million people jumping into investing, but they only have access to penny stocks. Sure, there is money to be made, but fuck is it risky, and there are certain things (taxes) you need to be ready for.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:09:38
Why so?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:16:18
You do realize inflation isn’t ALWAYS bad right?
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:08:44
You made the right call.
This is all just survivor bias
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:45:12
It all depends.
The other bubbles affected a smaller subset of people. Depending on the next one, it could burn a lot of people on the idea of not only Bitcoin but all cryptos. The whole "growing value" of cryptos is based on late investors trying to get in. If all of a sudden there are no more people interested in getting in, the value does not rise.
Now, yes, the value of crypto is not just in its ever increasing value, but reading through these forums, and talking to people, thats where most people see the value of Bitcoin. (which is dangerous)
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:05:35
Ok WPA vs WEP than
I’m just saying, king today != king tomorrow
It can, it’s just not a guarantee. 
I do get what you’re saying, and I appreciate your civility. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:51:52
Only so long as new investors are willing to put their money in.
The value of Bitcoin is its an asset with absurd growth, which is based on people jumping in now to get in on that growth. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:09:03
I understand the tech.
I don’t understand the value
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:18:36
That’s A LOT of the people 
Jesus, the fact that you care about about it’s value in fiat tells me exactly how speculative it is.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:07:57
Isn’t that steady growth reliant on new streams of investors?
That’s my issue. The increasing value of bitcoin is based on convincing people that bitcoin will continue to increase in value.
It’s not a stable store of value, it’s not a currency. It’s an asset with incredible growth that is growing because people are buying and holding and telling other people to buy and hold at higher prices.
I think crypto is the future, but I think Bitcoin is fishy right now
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:35:53
This space is odd...
People have a lot of biases because they want their “team” to win.
So coming here, you won’t get people who will tell you weaknesses compared to other coins.
But going to say ... you will get a lot of weaknesses... half of which aren’t even a concern.
Basically, don’t come here for unbiased due diligence 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:11:38
Uh, that’s not true at all. There are coins that are faster and use the same proof of works.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:10:42
Ethereum has the highest number of transactions currently 
Look, I’m not shutting on Bitcoin. Just trying to even the scales against the “all in” message this place gives 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:28:31
Look, I can understand why some people want to look at this and say “Hey, it will continue to 100k, there is no bubble”
But that’s just not realistic. You have an influx of people who want these gains, which is on turn causing the gains to increase, which is catching the eyes of more people. It’s a cycle. But it has all the classic tells of a bubble.
That doesn’t mean Bitcoin is bad. It means the way it’s currently perceived is.
The sooner the bubble pops, the healthier long term crypto will be. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:10:54
Ethereum kicks Bitcoins ass in terms of tech.
The creation of decentralized apps will be a huge deal in the coming years. Not to mention the possible applications of smart contracts.
Bitcoin is a ledger.
Ethereum (and other coins) are faster, and a ledger +.
Bitcoins only strength is its name recognition(which is a big deal)
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:05:18
And it has gone through multiple bubble phases. 
It just so happens they get bigger each time. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:49:05
If you’re near retirement and the majority of your money isn’t in bonds and other safe investments that’s on you
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:48:14
It’s relative.
Stocks are on the whole safer than crypto. But not the “safe” option.
