I've got mine and love the thing although shipping was delayed by nearly 2 months due to a case supply issue.

software does need some polishing though to make it a great product (Close admin lockout remotely when fund's added, api or instant purchase notification).

it has everything to do with being in IL. IL has some of the most strict regulations with regard to MTSB's which they then prosecute at the State and Federal level.

I was carrying around a crying child, figured I wouldn't subject anyone to that. Plus I shake like a mofo when trying to take a video....

theres some info on PACER but it looks like he didn't register with FinCEN or with Illinois regarding 205 ILCS 657 (Money Transmitters Act). Illinois requires you to be bonded and certified in addition to being registered with FinCEN. Basically its nearly impossible to get registered properly in Illinois without some serious overhead.

it's terrible, I tried to do everything by the books for my BTM but it's nearly impossible here :'(   
unrelated of course, anyone want to buy a skyhook? I'll drop in a free wall bracket...

minerd is not a virus and is used for cryptomining in general. It wont give you any info from virustotal. As of late its been making its way around a few large institutions via gained admin credentials. 
We found it in our labs on campus and then realized it was getting pushed out though out AD servers via a hidden scheduled task that was installed on a service account. Basically it would randomly dump the AD tree then push minerd to any computers which didnt report the process as running. We found the config embedded in the .net when we debugged it and that led us to a mining pool which was happy to help find the culprit. 
Basically the minerd is just the byproduct, you've more than likely got an issue higher up the tree... Start by looking for network mining traffic with wireshark or something. You cna also try wiresharking the webserver to see what pool and credentials its using to mine. These will be cleartext in the data packet around the stratum call.
Highly recommend looking at any other machines which have any shared accounts across the environment. I'll try to dig up my notes on how we dealt with it to give you some insight.

Got mine recently, it's pretty sweet and easy to setup minus a few polishing touches that they'll hopefully address in the next release.  - unboxing
Make sure you check out state laws regarding MTSB and register appropriately if you're in the US.... Uncle Sam wants his cut damnit.

Out of curiosity what type of ATM was it? Some ATM's give the operators the ability to choose the fee amount. If you have an operator that opted for no/low fee it may take a while for the transaction to confirm. 
Typically this is a bad call though since customers might go elsewhere if you consistently take a while to confirm and most operators realize this (I hope).

Glad someone can make some use of it! I made it to advertise mine then could afford to meet the financial regulations Illinois forces on MTSB's. Figured I should give back to the community in some fashion :)

Or you've already lost your ass buying the equipment and are just trying to slightly offset your losses before the drop.

ah sorry about that, not sure where to post this stuff anymore as the btcforums are crap, ebay is a joke and everyone tries to kill you on craigslist.
