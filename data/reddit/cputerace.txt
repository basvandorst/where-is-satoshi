The simple answer should be that a hard fork is analogous to a stock split. You are not "given" Bitcoin cash, your existing asset becomes two assets. Since a stock split is not a taxable event, you don't have to worry about it until/unless you sell the forked coins.

Any idea who owns it? Would love to see the ATHDA as I outlined it displayed on that site.

It is not "insecure" if it is combatting a demonstrable negative attitude towards Bitcoin due to misunderstanding.

The threat of competition is sufficient to keep prices in check.


So then why the Government granted monopoly?
Your argument that "we shouldn't repeal it because it isn't causing a problem" is the reason why we have so many horrible laws on the books that are causing more problems than they are supposed to fix.

Just because more than one exchange used a flawed mechanism to track Bitcoin transactions does not mean that MtGox is any less at fault for the disaster they unleashed on the Bitcoin community over the past few days.

Which is only true because the Government grants the ISP's monopolies.
So when the Government rules screw up the free market, what's the answer? More Government rules to further screw up the market.

In all of those cases (keyboard, library, shopping, world), what you are dealing with is NOT that actual item, but something that is pretending to be that item. Bitcon IS currency, it is not something pretending to be currency.

Virtual money has always meant video game money such as WOW gold or Zynga coins.
Specifying that Bitcoin is digital currency differentiates it from that genre of "toy" money.

Bitcoin Exchange developers used an incorrect method to track transactions (transaction-id). The method has been known to be a bad method for 3 years, yet the exchanges did not change their code to not depend on that method.
People recently figured out how to exploit those exchanges that use the incorrect method, so those exchanges that didn't change their code to not use the incorrect method are getting exploited. The exchanges are halting transactions until they implement the code change that they should have implemented 3 years ago.
edit: 1-&gt;3 years

But even in your example, there was a monopoly in place, so no one else was allowed to try to provide it.
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:59:50


Why? Why should those that live in urban areas subsidize those that live in the middle of nowhere?


They would still have options such as dial up or satellite. If you choose to live in the middle of nowhere, there will be costs.
@_date: 2014-01-15 19:53:56


I specifically stated "governments grant ISP monopolies", and from your response, I know that you understand that local governments grant these monopolies, so the only conclusion I can make is that your response stating "Sorry but no.. Governments do not grant monopolies for the ISP's" was simply to try to be confrontational and obtuse.


Exactly my point. Now that we have circled back to where you took a hard left turn off the conversation...
There is no competition in Broadband because of Government interference. Adding additional government interference on top of the situation in the form of forcing net neutrality is a bad idea. Instead, remove the initial government interference, which kills competition in the ISP market.
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:37:45
Exactly. Whenever the "x confirmations at 10 minutes a piece to confirm the transaction is final" quote gets thrown around, the first response should be "still less than 60 days for a credit card confirmation", since "confirmation" in this sense is basically "can't be reversed".

Could Bitcoin be coded in such a way that a miner could not mine two blocks in a row? i.e. a block that is mined by the same miner as the previous block will be treated as invalid?

MtGox had an automatic transaction complaint resolution system, so no one was actually looking at these complaints, so they were able to get away with it.
Now that it is out there, the reason others are having issues is that the sites are being ddos'd with these malicious transactions.
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:59:12


1) I am not 2) it has nothing to do with the conversation.


I am of the mindset that if the government didn't interfere, things would be in better shape than they are right now with the existing government granted monopolies and regulations.


If someone pollutes another persons property (or public property), they should be punished for that crime. The difference between punishment and regulating is what you need to understand. Regulations affect law-abiding citizens and corporations. Punishments only affect those that actually infringe on peoples property or rights.
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:05:39
Yes, when you have tunnel vision and only concentrate on one sentence, and ignore the entire rest of the definition, along with the definition of digital, and the differences between the two, then it seems clear.
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:38:52


No, it is digitally recorded. Virtual means "attempting to reproduce, but is not actually", as in virtual reality. Digital means it is stored on a computer. Bitcoin is not "attempting to reproduce" currency, it is actually currency.
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:20:18


This is an outrageously iditotic claim, and completely false. If it were true, then investors would never invest in anything except completely new business concepts where there is zero competition currently.
You clearly have zero understanding of economics or business, so we may as well end the conversation.

The title insinuates that this is the NYTimes post, when infact it is a blog post which reiterates and comments on the NYTimes post. The actual NYTimes post is hidden in a slew of links (no less than 4 of which link back to the blogs other posts).

One question thats been bugging me about that chart in the past is the drop in lower s/b tx count when there are still plenty more s/b transactions above it. For example, looking at the 4 day version of that top chart, how is it that the count of 0-5 s/b transactions dropped on Saturday?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:13:33
Makes sense, thanks.

Check the price once a week.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:17:00
At the current 4250, the [ATHDA]( is still only 26 days.

What's the official price of Bitcoin? It's a nonsensical question. Each exchange has its own price and ATH, and therefore it's own ATHDA.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:51:34
Not sure what you are getting at. All of your questions pertain to the *price* of bitcoin, not to the ATHDA value. Yes, the ATHDA will vary slightly based on exchanges, but so does the price, and bitcoin users have figured out how to communicate prices with multiple exchanges.

If there was already a notification that hasn't been swiped away, it would update the existing notification. There is no load on any server with this beyond the load that any other alerting app generates, it's all client side so work.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:55:13
Yup. Right now the [ATHDA]( is only 28 days.

It doesn't even need to be a small startup. In Massachusetts, where Comcast ruled, Verizon Fios started rolling out. In the towns that got it, prices for comcast tanked. I get 25mbps for $30, my friend in the town over that doesn't have FiOS access pays $40 for 3mbps.
The reason FiOS gave up and stopped adding more towns to their list? Local government regulations made it not worth their while to fight every single local municipality for the right to provide service.

As long as the fees are above zero there will be transactions that are priced out. If there fee is zero, however, Bitcoin dies because miners have no income. Therefore priced out transactions are required for Bitcoin to survive.
