Would you happen to have a link or more information about said cycle. That sounds fascinating.

They are in a wallet on the computer you were using at the time... Unless you started doing something on exchanges then traded the for other crypto and then ... Who knows. Or, you know, you used it to buy crazy stuff on Silk Road in which case maybe the FBI has sized the BTC and is actively trying to track you down... :)

I agree that the article is onesided and dismissive. I like your rebuttal. So kudos for that.
But energy consumption is a big concern for me even as a Bitcoin supporter. This thread seemed to ne filled with support for bitcoin that was equally one sided and dismissive of what is a serious concern for some.
You are right in the scheme of things 30k households is not that much for a global money supply. But this is part of why I support the alt coin ecosystem (specifically PPCoin for this concern) , so that if that number baloons to 30mil there is a robust alternative in place. Other coins address other possible problems. Since we don't know what exactly will happen better to embrace them all as part of the same umbrella.

DUDE, you rock!
There is a ton of Informal Economy in Fiji I bet I could develop some elevator pitches once I understand the business situations better:


I would never have thought car rental places but that makes perfect sense.
One thing... Fiji is not USD... if not the local Fiji Dollar they are Australian Dollars (or New Zealand Dollars).
Can Any of the Aussie BitCoin Redditers recommend what services to get setup with?

Btw... wtf? I guarantee that banks make money. 
If you mean the point of a *branch* is not to make money that is miss informed. Banks (traditionally) had customers who deposited money. Then they used some of that money to make loans and invest in things with a higher return than the (usually minimal) interest they pay to the depositors. Even now the strategy seems to be to charge customers of the bank fees and sign them up for credit cards.
But in both cases the branch serves as a convenient location for customers to come and transact. Thus more branches means more customers for the bank = make more money.

Fair enough. But what I guess what I am saying is that if the fundimental power usage profile turns out to be massive and unsustainable (even once they make chips that are as efficient as possible) then you cannot turn down the power usage arbitrarily (analogy close bank branches I guess) without compromising network security.
Thus why it is a good idea to have robust alternatives in place such as Ppcoin. But just my two mBTC.

But the 10th bank delivering the same function does not cost exponentially more. And the ongoing costs do not also rise substantially. Plus you can install power saving lightbulbs in the bank, if you try to do that in bitcoin what happen? As I see it there is no way to make bitcoin more sustainable. 
So pure propaganda, I think not. Now I'll just leave you this info link for [PPCoin](

The calendar that says payments due the first business day of the month. Also... see "fiscal year" and "quarter"

This... yes all systems require some effort, but which is optimal given the environmental situation we face?

Thank you, I had ran the numbers on my single rather beefy but somewhat old Desktop with a GPU.... very humbling.
I was hoping there might be some advantage to size (number of machines) that would be a tipping point and make it... worth it.
Also, if a bunch of people were running at the same time but in the background THEY would be paying the electricity, not me.
You are right about research... But I don't know much about CompSci theory, so I thought I would ask and see if it was worth EVEN researching :)

When I say power I mean electric power, thus environmental degradation (until the world is run on fusion).  And while I understand people's wish that bitcoin singlehandedly replace the existing banking structure, the fact is that banks are unlikely to be complety eradicated, maybe changed, but they will still be there. So it is not electeicity goes to existing infrastructure OR it goes to bitcoin... it is going to both regardless.
So i'd prefer we do not build an alt-currency that will have exponential power usage growth. Or even linear growth, when there is a alt currency (PPC) That will reduce its electric power consumption over time.
If made any other argument about bitcoin and defended it by saying "ya it is equally as bad as the bankimg system we currently have" it would not fly. What makes environmemtal concerns different? We should build something BETTER than the status quo.
I'm not saying get rid of bitcoin. If it has featues that other alt coins cannot capture, use it, and leverage other alt coins for their advantages so we have an optimal alt currency ecosystem. Perhaps BTC is for large transactions and PPC is for the consumer transactions... or whatever.
The point is it is a valid concern worthy of discussion.

Ok but as I understand it if your cell phone is creating all the bitcoins in existance then my TWO phones can attack the network and double spend.
As Bitcoin market cap reaches multiple billions and Trillions it is specious to say that the network could be run off a single phone. It "could" but the NYSE could also be run off of quills and parchment. But it wont ever again.
It seems like a valid argument that you are avoiding with fanboyism.

Thanks for the concern. I plan to be cautious on that front. That said I am also trying to make friends in high places where I can.
I have dealt with the Fijian police before and my Fiancee has relatives in various parts of the police... not to be that crude but as long as you have some paper currency in your wallet and a European/American passport... you can get away with a lot (not that I would press my luck)
