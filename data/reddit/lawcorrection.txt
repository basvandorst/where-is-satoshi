Prices are determined by the smart money big time players. Newcomers buying a coin or two have a nil to nominal effect on the market or prices.

That particular instance is easy because your broker files paperwork with the IRS reporting the gain.

Just so I am reading this correctly, if you buy a bit coin for 100 dollars, and it is worth 600 dollars, and you tip someone one bitcoin, you would have no taxable income? 
That does not jibe with my understanding of tax, but I am not a tax attorney. The reason that this seems odd to me is that if you had bought the bit coin, sold it, and then gifted someone 600 dollars you would still have to pay taxes on the 500 dollar gain.
That or you were just saying the gift itself is not taxable, in which case that makes more sense. Can you please clarify which you meant?

How in the world is someone supposed to learn the basis of a bitcoin from an anonymous donor?

Except for the part where bit coin uses the internet...

He could easily take a huge position in bitcoin though if he thought it had potential. He could literally just liquidate 5% of his worth and own half of all the market that exists. That would allow him to still be heavily invested traditional markets while being hedged into bit coin. The idea that he is being dishonest about his thoughts on bit coin doesn't make sense here. It isn't like the record label because there is no barrier stopping him from entering the bitcoin market.

Is that at BU?

It is not illegal. It used to be against the credit card agreements that they had with the card companies. A few years ago most of the policies changed and now it is fine to have this requirement.

You guys are beyond stupid.

So you don't want any government services?

Makes perfect sense.

His upside is reduced by a factor of 1:8 if he pays off the loan, but he gives himself a 0% chance of getting hammered on the loan. I would be willing to lose 1/9th of my upside to have a 0% chance of debt collection if the bottom falls out.

Isn't that 30 M usd?

Buying puts is mostly the same as selling off 1/9th of his position. At that point it just becomes a question of how volatile the stock is, how much the options cost, and how much further you think it will move. 
Also, is there even a reliable exchange for BTC puts? I would be seriously concerned about counter party risk.
