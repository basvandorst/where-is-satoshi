I bought into BTC a month ago when it was at $7,000. I just wanted a round number for the amount of BTC I own but couldn’t invest until January and it’s now getting to a point where the small I amount I needed to round my BTC up isn’t even half of the original amount I invested. It’s crazy how fast it’s growing.

Depends on how you feel about the future of bitcoin. I'd sell a fraction and pay any rent, debt, or just living expenses in general. If Bitcoin were to ever crash at least you've made use of the money.

I've just set up a blockchain.info wallet. Do you mean he doesn't need to use blockchain.info to do a paper wallet or do you mean to avoid blockchain.info entirely cos it's bad?

Oh so they don’t accept bank transfers in GBP? I didn’t even know that.

Coinbase does accept GBP. I’ve never had to buy in EURO and I use a debit card.

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and today. Seriously though buy now and then keep buying whenever there’s a dip. You’ll soon pick up when it’s a good time to buy and don’t worry in the slightest if the value drops further just moments after you do buy. It happens to everyone and there’s always that ‘if only I waited 5 minutes or 1 hour longer I would have gotten a better price’. In the long run those 0.0005 differences between prices won’t matter. Good luck!
