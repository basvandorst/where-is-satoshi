Buy a hooker for a half hour with bitcoin,. Now that would be impressive ��

That could be years away tho right??  I don't see many we accept bitcoin signs in shop windows around here,. And the only bitcoin cash machine I know about is now gone, seems like we have a long wait to seeing crypto as what we use to go shopping for groceries

Okay. Thanks. I see.   The fuckers don't want me to take the money out of their site,  the house always wins with gambling aye!
So the amount has added to my overall amount but on the individual transaction there is a small warning button,.  Does this mean I can't spend it?  What happens in this situation then ?

Cheers.  I didn't set my fee low enough I guess,.I've changed it now to a lower setting.  I'm not in a hurry
  The money's in my wallet but it says I can't spend it or something.   But it's all in on my bitcoin total. I don't understand it

I just had a reply from the nitrogen betting site, I set up a ticket and asked them,.  They said that they send my money to the wallet and gave me a link to it on the block chain.   They don't take fees in that way.  So it's copay for sure
So if someone buys a coffee with bitcoin does it mean that they cannot do the transaction because the fees are worth more than the coffee because the bitcoin price is so high??   I don't get it

It's not so easy to change the cash into bitcoin m,walk across the war zone and then change it back to cash on the other side,. I mean would it be easy enough to get some bitcoin in let's say the country side in Syria??

What tells you this is gonna happen tho??    Is it as more people jump on more is gonna be used,therefore the price goes up?
I'm thinking why not have my little bit of savings sitting in a bitcoin wallet growing rather than sitting under my floorboards In a lock box!  It would be safer and it's nice to know my extra cash is doing something other than getting eaten by money moth's

What are you talking about??

What kind of thing can make more people use bitcoin?  I know that in my country not many people know much about bitcoin at all,.  It seems to be a niche thing here,. Just drugs on the dark net and the odd coffee shop!!
