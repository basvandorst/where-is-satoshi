I am one of those who have substantial funds (5-digit EUR amount) locked up at bitcoin-24.com. I understand that there are some major problems both with trades gone wrong as well as bank accounts. Nevertheless, I am convinced that Simon is honest and doing the best he can to sort this out. In order to support him, I offered to reduce my claim by 7.5%, so he can pay for lawyer, losses, etc.. 
I know this will help, because some of the assets (EUR, USD, BTC) will have left btc-24.com before it was shut down. Thus, the pot will already be to small to pay everyone in full, even if the issues are resolved. 
I urge others to follow my example, so we can get this over with quickly and with as little pain as possible. Here is my mail, that I sent to help

I like your idea of putting pressure on the banks. I just sent the following mail to the press office of the Polish bank. I will post their answer if I get one.
