What? This isn't even close to true.. I'm a huge BTC supporter but don't be throwing out baseless claims like this to sound cool

damn man what degree did you get? Everyone I graduated with started in the 60k range and most have almost doubled that 7 years later

Great thanks for all the info

Yes but you have no way to know that. 50 could be worth 20 tomorrow. Could also be worth 70. If you knew the answer you’d be a millionaire taking on zero systematic risk. 
Therefore most recommend DCA. Say you put in 50 and it goes up next month. Then down the month after. You average $50 as of this day for 3 months. This is all in theory of course but DCA is your best bet

Because the debt is not structured like you taking out a loan to pay for something you want. Most is gonna be treasury bonds... there is excellence confidence in the US government that’s why the debt goes up. Think about it, if you had million in debt and made 50k a year would a bank loan you more? Absolutely not. 
You can’t think of it as the US begging other countries to loan us money as you would an individual and a bank. It’s COMPLETELY different on a macroeconomic scale. 50% of the debt is owned by the US and it’s all within reasonable limits 
TL/DR: as long as our GDP grows with debt, and there is consumer confidence in the US government it’s not a major issue. And you absolutely can’t compare it to an individual taking out a bank loan

Dollar cost average. Buy continuously over time. Example, $50 a month every month. Trying to time it almost always gets you destroyed unless you’re a serious investor. And even they still get burned a lot

Thanks for this. So at the end of the day, what point does something like Monero serve? You’re saying BTC is more private with the right configurations?

I think he’s just trolling. These reposts about toppling the banking system are making us laughable outside of this sub

What about when your boss sees you posting on reddit in the middle of the day? Are you fired?

Okay so I’m an SAP guy. So I can think of lightning as an SAP bolt on? A third party application that adds a new functionality? And bitcoin can support this?

Everyone has a boss my man

I mean in your example that’s pretty easy. But if a large company was making transactions it wouldn’t be hard to trace a date/time/amount etc back in the right circumstances

I don’t know I assume having the option would be nice. I don’t NEED a VPN but I do like the option and use it occasionally. Also for corporate adoption wouldn’t companies want privacy?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:46:37
How is that private though? Can’t you see all associated info (amount sent) with an address?
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:18:34
Yes r/btc is fake. It is not the real bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:50:12
I agree with your title but stopped reading when your first point was referencing the national debt. I don’t think you fully grasp macro economics and the difference between the US holding debt vs an individual. You can’t compare the 2
Also “upvote if you agree” is violation on internet law
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:34:34
Looks informative thanks. Will watch when I get a chance
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:35:55
DCA. Always

Think he meant the overall picture 
@_date: 2019-01-02 18:13:54
can anyone ELI5 what this means? 
@_date: 2019-01-02 18:30:16
Thanks!

What's the point of this post? That doesn't mean anything in relation to bitcoin. I want BTC and the US Treasury department to co exist if anything 
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:25:25
At first I hated you for this post (bitter because I only own a bit less than 1 BTC), but then when I really started looking at your numbers I’m inspired. I’m trying my hardest to max out my IRA and employee match my 401k while getting to 1 BTC. My income sucks right now but with these low prices I should get there by summer ��
Any advice? 
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:10:14
Thanks appreciate the response. I've been trying to figure out how to do side income but haven't found anything yet.
