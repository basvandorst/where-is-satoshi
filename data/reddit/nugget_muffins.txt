Why would someone pick a job they hated? Rarely happens unless you're a fuck up. As long as they don't get terrible grades and go to a no-name Devry/ITT Tech University they have a plethora of options depending on their field.
Bankers and Engineers make bank, and more than any "retail sales" dude with a high school degree does. Most love their job. Probably 2-5x as much in some cases.
I'm sensing you're the retail sales guy trying to rationalize why you didn't go to college...

$480 a week is around $23k a year pre taxes. Four years, that is around $92k, again pre taxes. Also you're working an exhausting shit job for 4 years that may or may not drive you insane. 
Going to school for 4 years and working 15-20 hours per week, you may become around $0-$100k in debt depending on financial aid/scholarships, and may make $50k-$130k a year depending on your major. 
This translates into progressive raises and a much higher quality of work life given that you're a degree holding educated individual.
Which one should someone pick? I'd pick the latter any day

Why so narrow minded about sales, of all things? It takes a certain type of person to be really good at sales too. Few people have those skills and it's not a viable option. 
Also as a salesperson who is making the real money? Hint hint not you. The CEO/Owner/VP who makes the profit on the accounting books, recording $500k in cost expenses and $8M in revenue.

As someone in investment banking and finance.. that's a fucking -10.4% move in a day. Huge. Fund managers would get heavily scrutinized by investors if that was a stock. 
Play your numbers fallacy, the shift is substantial in any big player's book. This isn't a game

You spent 20 years aiding people who have already fucked up in some way go to sales and get the motivation. That's how I'm taking it

I would agree with you that the growing college machine is sometimes of a business nature and not of a student success nature. 
On the other hand not everyone wants to retire at an early age relative to others because some genuinely enjoy their jobs and they can also be a passion. For example, an accountant in an office cubicle at big company might hate his job but an investment banker going to work M-F, doing cocaine off hookers and clubbing every weekend in VIP will love his job.
I think you have a generally narrow outlook on the types of jobs graduates get, it's a HUGE range and certain majors will end up in your ultimately bad scenario and certain majors will end up living very happy

The real question is who actually sells a house for bitcoin? That is a liability, legal, and tax mess

I can't buy Christmas presents or milk with bitcoin dude, but thanks for the helpful information. Are these BTC debit cards really tracked by U.S. financial institutions? Any verification or proof?
