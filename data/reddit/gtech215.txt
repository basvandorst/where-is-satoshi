Not the first nor the last scam like this we will see. You really have to be a dumb motherfucker to fall for anything like this.

Got a cool laser from them a few years ago. Still have it sitting right here. Dino direct made me feel good about ordering things from Asia. A bit spammy on the email though. Now Bitcoin friendly, this is awesome.

Exactly. I read articles that verge on hysteria, declaring cryptocurrencies as Ponzi schemes, complete fallacy, a joke, silly nerdery that is vulnerable to hacking etc etc. At first I got very annoyed, now I realize that it doesn't matter. People who read that kind of tripe cannot and will not understand alt-currencies. The best part is where the authors of these articles make the argument that fiat currency, the Federal Reserve, fractional reserve banking, is better, safer, more sensible, as if the dollar is backed by anything at all. Let them keep saying that, these are the types we don't need involved in this new economy.

Do you guys have a timeline for, you know, getting your shit together? 
I love Bitcoin and Litecoin, and want to see all exchanges do well. But Gox is the largest, and its behavior influences the market prices of all cryptocurrencies. Many feel as though Gox has a responsibility to set the standard for how an exchange should be run. Right now you are demonstrating the opposite. Trading lag, bad gateways, DDoS all day, every day.
The cryptocurrency movement NEEDS Gox (and other exchanges) to be operating at AAA+ status, with reliability, security and speed. I have family and friends that want to invest in cryptos, - and they do understand risk - but, when the exchange is down, lagged, and under hack attack EVERY DAY... Spend some of that money you are raking in and raise your game! You should be able to afford the best in hardware, web services, and personnel.
