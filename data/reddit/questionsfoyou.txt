Yeah, like I mentioned, Mt. Gox seems responsive to me.  However, bitcoinity shows only 20 trades over the last 36 minutes.  This seems extremely unlikely, especially given how many people are waiting to be verified and the general volatility in the price.

Thank you for this.  Although I'm sure you'll mostly get hate, you seem to be spot on.  There's no doubt this is a bubble, at least short term.  You alluded to the fact that it has no underlying value.  Everyone here has dollar signs in their eyes and dreams of a $1,000,000USD/BTC future, and are therefore emotionally invested in seeing this as the only outcome.  
But Bitcoin has real problems that they ignore.  Aside from having to wait an hour to get confirmation, the market is far too volatile to make Bitcoins useful for actual trade.  If I'm a merchant, I can sell something because I know that $100USD is still going to be almost exactly the same $100USD tomorrow.  With bitcoin, I could accept $100 worth as payment, and by the time I cash it out, it could be worth $75.  What business would ever take that risk?  Perhaps with easily-available options this will change, but right now it's only valuable as something to (hopefully) sell to someone else who will pay more.
Unfortunately, this will all be ignored.  Your years of real-world experience in this field will be viewed as inapplicable to bitcoin, because it is so magical and different from everything else.  It *is* different -- no doubt -- but the underlying assumptions are flawed.  
Anyway, thanks for bringing some much-needed rationality.  Most won't appreciate it, but some of us do.

Interesting.  Any idea/speculation as to the cause?  ClarkMoody is back and updating trades in real time as of 12:30AM EST.  I wonder if this is another DDOS like a few days ago when the price dropped rapidly to $75 for a short period.

Ouch.  Sorry, man.  That is a pretty misleading situation.  I could pick the Mt. Gox code out of the details because, well, it looks like a software registration serial number.  But, it doesn't really make much sense why they note that a coupon code is not needed.  I hate to say it, but there's probably zero chance they're going to refund you.  However, I hope I'm completely mistaken and that it was actually deposited into your Mt. Gox account directly instead of stolen when you asked for help.

Although I had forgotten it was a holiday weekend, I still figured with all the sudden media exposure people would try to participate.  After all, the markets (in general) are active 24/7.

That makes perfect sense, but the implications are very surprising to me.  I assumed that the majority of trading was from people buying and selling from existing accounts, and not from first-time buyers.  Otherwise, if it's all new individuals, I would expect the price to have jumped radically by now.  Instead, it's been somewhat stable (for bitcoin, anyhow).
