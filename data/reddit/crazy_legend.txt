As for Xapo i used Wirex as replacement.

Those charities will eat those money, only like 10ish % will go into the real needs, instead you can hire someone that will help some people by doing research and to some really in need, i mean many of the people in my country are poor and wanting to own a house, including me as a student who struggles with rent and stuff, you can start something yourself like a fund that'll help students, they're the most vulnerable, it's just a suggestion, however going into funds like this one above, i don't trust them.

It's not sending anything to anywhere, it uses CoinMarket cap API, soon I'll release version 2 before December, before they take the API down and make it private with limitations

Use the same link to the Google play store that's here, otherwise i haven't implemented to view the app from a desktop if there's such a thing i haven't learnt about it yet, learning goes slowly when University has other stuff that you need to pass.
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:45:28
But personally i use 
It's more pleasing for the eye

You either die poor or HODL long enough to see yourself become rich.

That's one interesting idea, if you would want to make something like that available on Android message me, here's my current project

And i invested just at 2.8k with $500
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:45:30
Their rates in every country are shit as fuck, if BTC is 3700 euros at their side it's 3500.
No wonder how they steal from their customers lol
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:25:20
same here brother, i bought at $2800 with my last $500
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:07:14
He could've bought two now
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:35:23
You'd trust their saying ?
When in background there are hidden fees and loading fees different from the ones they list on their sites

If it reaches $100.00 at any point in 2018, i'll invite myself to a dinner by myself alone.

That's why i built an Android crypto tracker app, it's the least i could do
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:34:51


Doesn't mean anything to me, i tried googling too.
It looks like vanity address too i noticed.

I live in an apartment with my mother, never bragged about money nor talked about Bitcoin.
I shared this here because in my country no one knows shit about Bitcoin, all i needed was a little help and I got this snarky comments, I may deserve what I got for being stupid but surely acting out smart on the internet makes you famous.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:32:24
I contacted and activated of course.
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:53:55
I wish it is this, but it would have stayed into my account's balance :(
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:54:14
You have family and such things behind you, I have no one.
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:52:20
How can someone open the confirmation link Wirex sends without even reading (opening) the email ?
I guess you can call that Wirex's fault
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:59:20
Apparently I wasn't the only one who suffered a hack, there were many guys, I'm glad my life is restored back to normal, thanks for those who supported me in this difficult time, may good things happen to your life.
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:27:14
They replied saying they are investigating the issue.
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:06:13
Only if you lived in my country to feel the hammer of this 
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:25:48
I didn't pay that amount to anyone else, unless Wirex changed some stuff but as I got the emails that the funds were sent.
My life is over man, I have bills to pay, buy food to eat, no work, full time student, this was my future, now it's over.
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:29:55
I pray for that too, but i'm hopeless my friend, it's like this is worse than nightmare.
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:15:20
thanks dear friend for all your support, it means a lot 
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:19:44
I'm using Linux, everything checked, inspected, I'm into IT and stuff and this happens, I am a shame to myself.
I still have no idea how they resetted the password without even access to my email.
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:29:15
I already submitted the ticket
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:40:37
They haven't replied yet, nor they are answering their phone.
@_date: 2017-09-20 09:43:19
I got my money back anyways.

Women go down sometimes too, if they don't go down for you then you get rid of them, when Bitcoin goes down you get em
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:36:17
i guess they paid out of their pockets, no info, i just got my money back but as i can see the money are in the hackers's address 
@_date: 2018-07-18 07:51:16
We don't need cards 
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:58:21
Thanks for that site, I'm implementing it in my app.
@_date: 2019-05-18 07:12:24
It was 10%, because BTC's value you see the drop in fiat, shame.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:07:26
or just use Blockchain
