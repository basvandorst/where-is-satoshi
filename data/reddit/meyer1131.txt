Hello Olaf, I am new to reddit and new to bitcoin.  I am a college student and bought 2.7 bitcoins on Coinbase last week at around $270.  Unfortunately, Coinbase sent me a "high risk" email at the last minute before my bitcoins should have been issued.  I inquired about this rejection to your customer support team; in addition, I sent a picture of my drivers license and school identification card.  On Coinbase I also verified my credit card.  Can you please respect my transaction and issue the bitcoins to me as I am a college student trying to capitalize on the opportunity.  I respect your security, but believe I have provided extensive credentials to validate myself.

Update! 
Olaf responded to my support email and fixed the problem!  Very happy with the customer support!

I checked the next day and saw two minuscule charges in the $1.xx range. These are what you enter to verify.

They are great! Excellent customer service.

I got pegged as high risk and went ahead and verified some more information on my Coinbase account and sent them a lot of my credentials (passport,  birth cert, drivers license) so there was no way they could think I was fraudulent. A day or so after my "high risk" cancellation and a few emails later, Olaf responded and re issued my original transaction. If you are patient and work with then they will definitely take care of you. They just need to make sure you are you who say you are.

I am a new reddit user, and new to the bitcoin community.  I am a college student and bought bitcoins last week on coinbase around $270.  Unfortunately, last minute I was given a "high risk" and my purchase was denied.  I contacted them via email and provided a picture of my license and school id.  I also went ahead and verified my credit card.  I am hopeful they will respect my order and send me my bitcoins at that price.

It won't matter because as long as you are who you say you are they will "most likely" push your transaction through manually. They have excellent customer service if you are polite and give them some time to respond.

This is a cool browser!  Also confirming I received my .001 BTC.

I would send a follow up email or reach out to some of the coin base guys on reddit. They were able to help me and were really nice. Best of luck

That looks awesome!

I also have experienced this problem though Olaf has whitelisted me.  I hope I will be okay for my next purchase.

I was PM'ing some of the coinbase members of the reddit forums.  They told me theyve experienced over 2000 support requests recently.  He told me that they will get to each and every request.  Fortunately, they got to my false "high risk" flagging and reissued my transaction at the original price!  Super happy with the customer support!
