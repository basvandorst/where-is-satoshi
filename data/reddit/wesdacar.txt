nice positive video, will be really interesting to see what happens when ETF is launched to "middle America" as they say...
@_date: 2016-08-06 05:48:54

dam, so close but yet so far. What a pity.

scam. delete.
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:32:36
so true, I was getting dirty looks from everyone when I was buying BTC at 3.5k and now they climbing over themselves to buy and asking me if it will come back down again to buy. LMAO, rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:33:05
I have been using [Purse.io]( since 2016 - good service

Lol how did you know? ��
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:30:37
well, technically speaking there can still be human error....
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:34:31
you will find the distribution will not allow for 300k sats per person. As with everything else Pareto principles will likely apply.

Thanks, what is the URL?

If you are not running a full node there isn't much to worry about.
@_date: 2019-11-28 14:43:44
yep, likely the same for many regions and countries though. The reality Is the man on the street has been firmly rammed up the arse for a long time without knowing how or why.... once the penny drops (more widespread) there will likely be a backlash. Just look around at the rioting around the world that is so poorly reported by MSM.... riot gear equipment for government policing and army forces are going through the roof...... what are they preparing for?

To be fair, no central bank policies are working. Globally we are in uncharted waters. This experiment with fiat is likely nearing an end.

There is nothing on Bloomberg bout this as the ZH author suggests. Not very compelling at all.
@_date: 2016-11-23 03:30:06
house of cards
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:04:13
I would argue that what happened was due to the miners delaying the activation of SegWit leading to congestion and higher fees ... now that we have SegWit and L2 transaction systems we shouldn’t see that happen again for a while or hopefully ever... 
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:59:59

thanks, is there a link ? (I can't find anything?)
@_date: 2016-11-23 03:49:06
thanks for that, certainly very interesting. Fungibility, being one of the main traits that we always profess bitcoin to have as a feature seems to be "under attack" - improving its fungibility properties, would seem to me, as a top priority. Perhaps, dare I say it, one ahead of block size?
@_date: 2016-11-18 03:00:12
what is the speed they promise?
@_date: 2019-08-04 05:17:03
Good story - decency goes a long way and doesn’t cost much :)

try CryptoFish [Bitcoin101]( section to answer a lot of your Bitcoin questions. You can also [buy bitcoin with credit card or debit card]( globally or try ACH if in the US
@_date: 2019-10-13 12:48:47
Agreed... get your Opsec sorted :-)
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:06:21
Always knew Tone was right on this, but where the real bottom will end up is anyone’s guess. I think a 1.3k bottom would mean a 2-3 year bear market as people would lose all confidence.... the tech will continue and the improvements will keep coming no matter... hard to do, but long term thinking is the way to go :-) 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:42:04
no I am just happy to see bitcoin over 60% dominance again... 
@_date: 2019-06-16 11:40:18
if you want to buy on credit or debit card [  
if you want in person try [

[CryptoFish]( for debit and credit card in most places, ACH in the US

Hi there, I am getting a little freaked out at hearing these theft stories. So I have just put my coins into Ledger (small smard-card/usb key thing), how do you guys rate the safety on that, can I sleep easy?
@_date: 2017-04-13 17:04:32
I second that
@_date: 2017-04-13 07:41:56
suppose its one way to test what the market wants... "no segwit"... price goes down, "support segwit" price goes up... just a thought.
edit: seems more and more likely that UASF is the only option for Segwit.
edit 2: USAF -&gt; UASF

All optics IMHO they actually don’t know what to do. It’s going to go ahead whether they like it or not and their citizens will demand it. Once a few countries start using it, those who don’t will be prejudiced.

Yes exactly. The backbone.
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:51:16
who knows, with the shutdown of miners in China's South-West maybe the playing field will change? where are Bitmain's mines located? 
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:07:30
agreed, it puts things into perspective.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:05:36
Totally agree, let them have their headlines.... Segwit is what counts.
Edit: grammar 
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:47:24
What an absolutely pointless article. Amateur....
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:30:31

@_date: 2017-06-20 09:54:05
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:20:11
Yes this.
@_date: 2017-06-04 16:01:33
Please elaborate a little for me, is it correct to say that if user/business/miner support Segwit (readiness etc) as per the comment you ended off on then will they automatically be on the UASF chain? Do they not have to change their node to UASF/BIP148? It's a bit vague to me, sorry if this has been explained already. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 08:19:01
Love it 
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:21:27
Agreed. It's easy to fall victim to the I want everything and I want it now mentality. Preserving Bitcoin as a robust immutable, scarce, censorship resistant layer of trust should be the number 1 priority otherwise building other fancy layers/features upon it will be pointless.
