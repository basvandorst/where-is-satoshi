It literally wasn't at all... We know what the Tor malware was. Once they got a hold of the servers, they just uploaded malware to infect everyone's computer with a certain Onion Tor Browser. 
That has nothing to do with the attack on SR

I hope Ross gets off simply because of this. Anyone that followed that story knows it doesn't add up even slightly. To add, once he went to trial, he was basically rail roaded through, and was not given a fair trial by any means.
I suspect his lawyer knows this which is why he's playing it slow to get everything in order.

I used to arbitrage between Gox and BTCE.  It was a fucking nightmare getting money through BTCE. I can only imagine how hard Korea would be. I was losing 10% just moving money around with slim margins. So unless Korea has significantly high price differences I highly doubt it would be worth it.

I never knew why we had it to begin with. It is useless, and always has been. Honestly, it felt more like a group of enthusiasts who just wanted into BTC and hoped to become the spokesperson for the decentralized currency in hopes of profiting off it in the future.

There is a project in the works called BitCloud or something similar. Basically it creates a tor like network, where the cryptocurrency is given to nodes and hosts. And users can use the cryptocurrency to buy services or privileged network access. 
It's a pretty novel idea. For instance, if you have a really popular streaming service, you get rewarded with a lot of the curency. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:26:22
Lol, you simply don't buy a 3 letter domain like that. It's VERY expensive. Also to mention that the owner of Gox.com has said on the record that MtGox was very interested in buying the domain and were negotiating a price.

They still wont have to return the BTC as it's been proven to be used in illegal actions. For instance, whenever the police raid an illegal grow house and seize pounds of pot and cash, and then the case is thrown out, the cops don't have to give the person back their pot and cash.

Yeah, thank you for some reason. So many ridiculous claims around here. I just had another guy tell me basically, "...Or... He found some billionare and just unloaded the keys and wallets to him." Like, really? People actually think this is possible? Mark, making 40m a year, with 100k in BTC, just decided to up and leave. Then think he can just someone how magically hide the transaction and while authorities are all over him for losing half a billion of other people's money, he's going to magically hide and spend it w/o them ever catching on? W/o a PI catching on? W/o fear of assassination? You don't just walk away with half a billion dollars of other people's money.
He was never a great businessman. He just got lucky by being the first exchange out. he was incompitent, refused to be transparent, never communicated with the community, and was way too mysterious. But he didn't do this on purpose. The guy must be a wreck right now. I don't feel sorry for him, but he's definitely fucked up big time and is well aware of his mistakes.

If the NSA has had Tor compromised for years, how come the leaked Snowden files has the NSA talking about theoretical ways to crack Tor with a program that would take months of DDoSing using tons of NSA server resources, for a small percent chance to uncover it. Also, the files also talk about how agents should use Tor for security. It's not like the NSA to use something they have already found to be vulnerable, because their logic is, "If we already have cracked it, it's safe to assume another government has cracked it."

SR routinely had errors that would reveal it's location. That was nothing new. And soon as it would reveal it's IP, DPR would get notified and immediately nuke and relocate the server. It's really nothing new. That's what makes it fishy. Why are they trying to say they got the IP through ridiculous means that are feasibly impossible, when many people already say the PHP dump itself a number of times. Why aren't they just using that one? People suspect it's because they already F'ed up with their excuse and are now forced to continue running with it. It's too late to go back and change their mind.
The second question? Is that a question? That IP is the IP of a local network. Basically your internet IP goes into your router and then gets split up into other local IPs that can only be used by people on that network. That's how the router knows which device is requesting the data. 
I think what the commentator is saying is that it seems like the the PHP dump just revealed the clients network IP. I THINK what he's saying is it didn't go FBI Client &gt; SR front end &gt; SR backend... Rather, FBI client &gt; SR front end &gt; back to FBI. So the dump was just revealing what the FBI's network IP was.
It's really late and hard to explain, but I'll look for a pretty straight forward write up on it that explains the technicals in an easier fashion. But from what I remember is just about EVERY netsec expert out there is saying that the FBI's claimed attack is impossible. Like, on a technical level, it's just not how computers work. The netsec community thinks the FBI is trying to pull this route to confuse the judge since it's really hard to explain complex networking to a 50 year old.
EDIT: Not the paper I was thinking of, but this write up is much more clear on the current issue :

OMFG, that's ridiculous.... "Okay guys, don't worry if we ever lose your coins and are forced into bankruptcy, don't worry, your coins are insured... By us... Who is now bankrupt and unable to cover the insured coins." 
That's so cheeky, I'm actually more upset over that stunt than them trying to make a profit by charging a few cents on transactions. One is just manipulative and misleading, the other is just a shitty part of their business model.

If these are stolen, you can bet your ass people will track all of the transactions down and create a list for every exchange to follow. People lost millions, and are very connected within the community. You simply can't unload a significant amount of coins like this on an exchange w/o pissed off hands trying to track it down.

And this is finance. There is a reason banks are insured by the government and not themselves, because it's simply impossible to hold a reserve of cash that large to just sit around. 
Most of these startups that self insure aren't in finance and are simply putting 1million aside and jus in case something ever happens to you they guarantee a pot of cash to cover it. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 03:43:03
The point is, all those OTHER people that are working on it that don't win the purse. Then they'll happily sell them to the US government or at the least offer them up for free. The thing is, usually an exploit like what Russia is looking for requires multiple different exploits that chain out and form a big vulnerability.
So even if I, a researcher, aren't able to find enough bugs to get to the point where Russia is trying to get, surely some of those bugs I did find will be enough to stop the big exploit. Because once you patch the smaller ones, they can no longer execute the larger one.

Yes it is... This is the discovery phase where both sides try to see what type of evidence they are allowed and prevented to bring to trial. This is one of the MOST IMPORTANT parts of any case. This is where a case is either made or broken. If they aren't able to convince a judge that the servers were legally discovered, then the most they are going to be able to bust him on is getting those fake passports.

I personally talked to MagicTux a year or so ago, and let me tell you, the guy is not the person who knows how to run a business. There is so many basic things that he just completely overlooks, and the only reason he was the largest exchange was just sheer luck. He acts like a small business owner, and not the owner of a multinational currency exchange platform. 
I remember when it was getting DDoS'ed I wanted to strangle him. I had to explain that a multimillion dollar operation needs to act like a multimillion dollar operation. He then tried to tell me that this company isn't that large, so I grabbed the data that's publicly available and forced him to concede that, "Okay, we are pretty big."  He reminds me a lot like the non-business savvy first generation immigrant small business owners. You know, those guys that open up small shops in the city? Usually everything is overpriced and their service is abysmal while they nickle and dime you on everything. But they do okay business because they are the only people in town. Then a real business owner opens up shop down the street where everything looks nice, offers great customer support, and is really friendly with everyone. These guys start taking all their business, and the immigrant owners can't understand why they are losing all their business. They can't comprehend that they need to maintain their reputation and brand within the community. 
This is MagicalTux. I'm telling you, just talk to the guy and you'll quickly realize he doesn't give a flying shit about anything. He's already making decent money and sort of doesn't really care about being efficient. His method is sort of, "Don't worry about it. I'll get it working when I get it working. I already have more than enough users. They'll be fine." It's literally mind blowing how shitty of a business owner he is.

So? You know the NSA still uses it for their spies. The NSA isn't the type of organization to take ANY risks. If they put a backdoor in it, they wouldn't be using it. They are the type that if they even THINK something is remotely possible, they counter it. Take for instance wiping the HDD with random 1's and 0's 8 times. No one has yet been able to recover data from a single HDD that was wiped randomly over just once. However, they are afraid it may be possible, and the enemy may know something they don't, so they still do it 8 times just in case.

See all these theories are terrible. You assume there isn't going to be a MASSIVE investigation following the loss of many millions of dollars. Mark wont simply be able to hide all that newfound money. He's going to have every little aspect of his life checked, from end to end. This isn't the wild west. You can't simply walk away with over 500 million bucks - I know, I know, "HAHA But that banksters!" - of other people's money and not have the government look heavily into it. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:25:58
I think it's definitely safe to assume that malleability is out the window. MK has a history of not really discussing anything, being quiet, and often misleading on what he's really doing. 
So with this sort of knowledge, all we can really do is speculate with what limited information we've been given. One thing that is for sure though, the official story is unbelievably unlikely. I'd even go as far as the speculated stories are unlikely. If and when the dust settles, I would bet that this all would have been something not a single person would have speculated. 
Nothing is even remotely clear. If it was a theft, where is the blockchain hints at this? So far, all we can see is that there was recent actions with one of the cold storages, which could indicate a number of things: from, actual theft, to a cover up, to even a glitch in a new system that caused them to lose it all. I can't find any speculative evidence that points to any of these answers being likely.
I'd even say theft is less likely, because I just don't think the risks outweigh the rewards. I just don't think it's possible to get away with a theft in the long term. I also don't think Fed involvement is highly likely because I don't think they'd need to seize the actual wallet to track down SR dealers. I think his talks of "US legal issues" is simply the 5mm that Coinlab is fighting them for, and the 5mm seized from their US bank account. 
IMO, if I had to speculate on what is most likely, is they fucked up during some infrastructure work, lost the coins due to incompitence, and **THE THING THAT EVERYONE IS FORGETTING** embezzled the USD, knowing that he's likely lost all the BTC. Seriously, where the fuck is the discussions on the 60mm USD being stolen? That's a FAR harder thing to steal and get away with. 
Knowing the company was likely fucked, he just took the cash, and hopefully can find a way to recover the BTC and just walk away from it.

Not yet... But the "official" story from his perspective is sketchy as hell, and he's CERTAINLY lying about some aspects. It's just a matter of time before the law understands BTC enough to catch him in his lies. 
Also, AFTER he lost the coins and was insolvent, he continued accepting BTC and cash deposits, which is illegal.

Did you read it? The case is currently trying to see what evidence is going to be used in court, and right now the focus is on how they got the private IP of the SR backend server, which lead them to seizing it, which lead them to busting DPR.
If they can't show how they legally got that IP, then everything from this case falls apart and DPR will literally walk free. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 23:18:08
Generally, those agencies aren't doing the illegal stuff to bust people, rather to spy on people for intelligence gathering. They also have been known to use parallel construction and get away with it. However, in this instance, they aren't able to get away with parallel construction, and it's starting to look like they may not be able to close the deal. I suspect, they already know this, which is why they are leaving the murder for hire charges quiet, as a backup to bust him with.
@_date: 2014-10-08 05:22:31
While they are at it, they should make it so you only need the last 500 blocks of the blockchain to be connected to the network. There is no need to have the ENTIRE blockchain from day one to have a client. If we make it required just to have the last 500, then we can keep that file size reasonable, while still having a record of all the previous chains as well... But that's only optional.

The ID thing was a very real issue with Gox. Tons of people where using Gox to steal money via identity theft. It was a huge problem, because finding a safe and anonymous was to dump someone's bank account is near impossible. Gox offered a solution from heaven.
 Ie, gain access to someone's bank. Wire money to Gox. Buy coins. Withdraw. Resell for cash. 
The bank he was using tried to drop him many times because all of the identity theft issues were becoming too much of a problem and pain for the bank. 
Though that doesn't free him from being the sloppiest and most incompetent player Bitcoin has ever seen.

I study law closely, went to school for it, and still follow many court cases. I'm not some guy that just read a Gizmodo article and started jumping to conclusions.
I mention the documentary, because it does a great job near the end at giving a brief perspective on how terrible this case was handled. I'm not going to bother explaining it a hwole lot, because based off your attitude, it seems like you're more concerned with arguing semantics and tiny irrelivant details, than the actual subject.
But I'm not going to bother. Anyone that's followed this case, especially people familiar with law, will say either "This was extremely unfair" or "Drug dealers are routinely treated unfairly". 
We have instances of relevant information being excused from the court, defense prevented from bringing in relevant expert witnesses, being gagged about certain relevant aspects to the case, and so on... It really does go on.
The problem is, all this suppression, prevents the whole story from coming out. The prossecution was afraid that the case could get thrown out on a technicality if all the information was presented, thus letting a guilty man go free (let's get real, he's guilty, but we just will never know to what extent), so they suppressed as much as they could to ensure he doesn't get off.

And no, I'm not going to bother. I'm done with you. Just by the way you talk, you are clearly here with an agenda. I'd gladly have this conversation with a descender, who actually wants to have a discussion.  
You're the type where you go, "Give me details?" Then I provide it, and you go, "Where does it say that? I want a legal source," Then I do, then you go, "Well, I want to see your degree, because the judges disagree." In fact, you argue almost identically like a SJW.

There is a good documentary coming out next month that covers this case. It really is a kangaroo court in this case. The defense was washed over, muscled around, and really never given much of an opportunity. He was already guilty walking in, the court was just trying to nail the excuses to finish him off.
I love law, and this case is really dramatic from a legal perspective. There was a lot of unfairness on the prosecution's side, and I'd argue that dirty is a fair word. 
Like I said, the doc is already out and it may be online, but it officially comes out next month. It's a shame his side of the story is never really given a full chance, so it'll just be a case that remains a huge mystery on what actually happened. We know the prosecutions side is filled with holes, but it's hard to determine which is BS and which is real for many of the points.

Most, however, charge like 5-10%. It's insane. Only useful for small purchases.

I think people failed to realize the last run was mostly fueled by money laundering via people trying to get trapped capital out of places like Russia and Iran. They’ve been steadily washing it and converting it back to cash. 
I don’t think we will see that again anytime soon. 
@_date: 2019-10-06 09:46:45
They all still have strict identity proof processes. You can’t just put cash in and transfer coin to a wallet. You still need to get verified.

Lol I was involved with bitcoin since launch. Sold everything for 10k at around a dollar. 
I didn’t listen to those evangelists who insisted I hold. Figured it was only good for buying drugs from the Silk Road, and being a novel thought experiment about the value of currency.
Don’t do the math. It hurts me.

SR is what made bitcoin what it is today. Before SR there was no real use for BTC. SR then came and put it on the map. Plus I’m still sure most people using BTC today are actually spending it on dark nets rather than buying haircuts and shit.

I have no problem with this. Since they are a new type of financial institution, they are having severe problems with fraud and don't have the same legal protections that normal banks have...
It's unfortunate, but I think this is a good way for them to protect themselves until they can get recognition down the line. Having access to people's FB will probably help prevent some cases of theft.

Ummm... Isn't that why people prefer SR over street vendors because they are confident on the quality of product. SR vendors rely on their reputation, and would never try to pass something off as something it's not -- assuming they still want business on the site. Whereas, street vendors don't care, they'll cut it with whatever they can find, and don't care what you think, since you will most likely never see them again.

No you guys definitely have value. I've done it before. But I mainly use you guys in more remote areas with less developed infrastructures. The hassle is the premium (Many sellers are just acting as middle men) as well as taking the time out to meet someone in person.
You guys best for less developed places like here in Berlin where it's hard to get.

I was just arguing with some people in the TOR sub. They are convinced that BTC can be tracked, and probably will... I tried explaining how difficult a process this is to both follow the chains, and identify who owned that coin down the chain (international transactions) and the tumble effect once it hits SR and MtGox... They argue that all they need to do is subpoena MtGox, and they will have all the information they need (which I think can't even get them to issue a warrant. Proving that my coins came from SR doesn't prove enough to get a warrant).
So, coming from people that know more about this than I and probably [how right am I? How much truth is there to their comments?
In case anyone [wants to read the discourse.](
@_date: 2016-09-23 09:12:29
I've sent my coins to my cloud storage wallet, then from there just buy random shit with it whenever I can. Yeah, mostly via direct pay. 
And again, you're the second person to bring up gambling -- and, never ever gambled. How the hell do they even know you are sending it to a gambling site? The wallets are anonymous. Are the sites publicly tagging the wallet as associated with them??

I actually went with circle and actually found them great. Super easy with no resistance. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:40:04
I am very confident it's going to hit around 2000... As it was creeping up to 1,000 I noticed a lot of chatter going on about using BTC to get around Russia's sanctions preventing wealthy people moving money around. We know Russian's already have been doing this for a while. Then congress was getting more aggressive on Russian sanctions after the election, which caused this laundering business to boom.
I knew right away the bubble was from insane amounts of money being laundered through BTC to get around the sanctions and into EU/US. So once the dust settles after all the laundering has finished and the leverage has unwound, it'll probably normalize back around 1.7k
@_date: 2016-09-23 11:23:04
No, of course not. Of course they need money. I'm just saying from a buyer side, there are usually better alternatives. LocalBitcoins has a specific niche use that isn't necessary for most casual users of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 13:20:47
Last time I bought bitcoins was 4 months ago... Then I just buy some again. And 10 minutes after buying them for the first time in months last week, they close my account. I didn't even have time to send them any where else because my ACH hadn't even gone through. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 10:08:49
Well localbitcoins is fucking expensive and a hassle. Honestly i like ease of use, which is why i liked Coinbase. They made it really easy to just buy coins whenever I wanted them without the hassle. But I like Circle. They'll give me 300 dollars worth a week which is good enough for me. And super easy to use. Wish I knew about them before Coinbase took 600 bucks from me. 
I want to figure out  how to fight this. But I can't call, and they never respond to emails. What a shitty company. I wish I knew better. I always figured, "Eh that's those other people's problems doing shady shit. I will never have to worry about it." Low and behold, here I am.

Everyone keeps saying Circle, and I agree. It's great. Basically you just store it there as bitcoin, and you can send whoever you want cash or bitcoin. If it's cash, they just automatically convert it for you and send it. Also, no shady Coinbase shit. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 08:03:14

You are expecting everyone to use a complicated crypto currency. I'm not being ignorant when I believe it's going to be tough to get people that don't even know how to use a computer to use this currency. I know I sure as hell couldn't get my parents, in the West, to figure out how to use BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:52:19
Yeah to be honest, I never thought it would go beyond DNM utility... And honestly, I still think it really hasn't. It's like gold... The real use of the stuff is limited, the rest of the value comes exclusively from speculation. 
Crypto is mainly for criminals. All this "mainstream" stuff is just wishful thinking. I've been part of the BTC community from day one, and nothing has changed. Just people trying to figure out ways to hype the tech thus raise the value in coins, and get more money out of it.
But ACTUAL utility and use, is for drugs... Buying a hamburger with it is a cool novel idea, but it's not what it's actually being used for.
@_date: 2016-09-23 16:36:20
Damn. Now I feel bad. Never should have donated :(
@_date: 2016-09-23 09:09:59
I'm just curious on the technicals of this. The wallet you send it to is unique... So does Satoshi, for instance, then send the coins from your wallet, to a known central wallet? That's how it can be tracked to them? You just look at the block chain and follow the path?
Or are these sites marking the customer wallet so it's known that you are sending it to satoshi?
Like I said, I've never gambled once, but I'm just curious on how it's done. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 10:21:03

Speaking of the devil. Just got an email:  
Thank you for your interest in Coinbase. Our primary goal is to make our platform safe and secure for our customers. Coinbase is a regulated Money Services Business under FinCEN (FinCEN.gov), and as part of our responsibility, we are legally obligated to implement regulatory compliance mechanisms.
Unfortunately, it does appear that you have violated our user agreement. We regret to inform you that we are no longer able to support your Coinbase account as well as any other accounts you may have created. Please note, we have not blocked access to the balance currently in your Coinbase account; while we can no longer process brokerage orders via our banking relationship, you may still send your balance offsite to an external address.
@_date: 2016-09-23 15:33:29
They still shouldn't be shutting down my account without warning. I'm just passing through. And I've bought multiple times here before, without a problem. They could,, you know, just stop the transaction until I get him... Maybe warn me. Something. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 13:47:55
It's not. And it's especially no reason to completely shut me out and take my money. A simple, "Hey Duff, mind confirming your identity for us real quick?" would suffice over theft. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:25:35
No, dude, it's really like that... 5 bucks, no miminum. It gets even crazier in bulk. DNM's have caused prices to plummet across the board as everyone competes with transparent pricing.

I'm an American citizen, with American bank accounts, American address, and American everything else. I've used Coinbase out all over Europe before, and they've never complained when I bought my coins through my American self. They aren't serving Germany, they are serving the identity registered to the account. It's never been a problem.
Regardless, it's still not grounds for termination, as seen in their user agreement. Sure, block the transaction and notify me to wait until my return to the states. Or at least let me know. But don't STEAL 550 dollars from me just because I placed the order. 
Yes, I blame THEM for stealing my money. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 22:44:42
Let's get real though... The darknetmarkets probably are resposible for the overwhelming bulk of BTC goods/service transactions. Sure, this guy got 20 BTC today, but a single decent darknet market does that in an hour -- and there are tons of them.
@_date: 2016-09-23 10:10:14
Yeah, it's coincidental that it came about 10 minutes after purchasing my coins. They probably have an algorithm, for sure... But why? What fucking flagged me? Could it be that I'm in Berlin wanting to use BTC to buy from local vendors to avoid my banks ridiculous conversion fees? I've bought from Coinbase while in Europe TONS of times before. Why is it now suddenly a problem?
@_date: 2016-09-23 07:11:41
They wont say. I looked over the agreement and I can't think of a single one I broke. 
Like I to the other asshole who's "Glad they took my money" (Who says that?), my account was fully verified and tied to my CC and bank for several years. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:16:44
Russia triggered the bubble... Their vast amounts of cash are what caused it to start that initial burst. Their money alone wasn't responsible for it all going up, but they built the bubble.. Eventually tons of people started jumping in again not wanting to miss out on THIS bubble. So a bunch of new non-Russian money started coming in... And now since it was so high, it was now more valuable, so tons of startups and VC money started flooding in. 
This is why I don't think it'll go back down to 1k. All that new money is going to lift the bottom up quite a bit. Even if most of the people pulled out, there is still much more money into it as a whole than it was before. But the Russian money which kicked it off and brought it up, is probably mostly long gone by now... Now it's floating on other's money who followed them and still hanging around.
@_date: 2016-09-23 13:48:55
I definitely don't gamble at all. I'm visit Vegas all the time. I don't need to gamble in secret online. 
So even if I gave my coins to someone else, and THEY gambled, that would trigger it? That's dumb.
It further makes no sense though... Why wait until I buy more coins to then ban me? They should have done it when they got a flag. Not wait until I sent them 550 bucks. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 20:33:18

@_date: 2011-06-06 12:06:37
No one is going to use Bitcoin as a serious currency until it settles the fuck down. Those two coins I bought something with yesterday could be worth double that today, which is why most people are reluctant to buy with them.
What we need to do is increase volume to help stabilize it. Until then, no one, much less Google, is touching BTC.
@_date: 2011-09-03 18:27:14
Yup, and when I click the link the email it goes straight to that page. No letters switched around, nothing. Just the legit domain.
So most people are saying it's a phishing thing, while it seems legit. So I assume that I honestly am getting an email from them that is saying my account is banned. (Probably the same email that the scammers use --logically-- so it's easy to think it's a scam even if it's not.)
The PW I use on that site is very unique and the only way to get it would be via a trojan. But even then, I haven't actually logged in in months.

Ha! Funny you say that. I only use tradehill for trades. Primarily because I, as a customer, hate having to make a password that requires a cap and lower case, a number, and a non numeric or alphabetical character. Oh, and every 5 minutes I have to log back in with that ridiculous password requirement. Yeah, it's those little things that scare away me, and I am sure many others.
I don't use BTC in the currency market any longer but do direct BTC trades for goods now and simply don't want to be bothered when I just need 10 BTC for a quick transaction. Tradehill works great for that: Simple login, quick trade, and then I do my business. I feel like MtGox is for the large amounts of people that look at BTC as a financial oppurtunity rather than a currency. Granted, so is Tradehill, but they make my personal use for BTC as a currency so much easier.

It would take several days for the Dwolla acct to send you the verify, and then another several days to actually transfer the funds.
Then yeah, technically after you some how lucked out to do that, all you need to do is create a new BTC wallet and buy the coins off mtgox and send them directly to your savings wallet. You don't even need a mixer, just a wallet you don't have posted online. From there you can transfer the coins to yourself or whereever

This is why BTC can't take off. Because the infrastructure is completely unprofessional and doesn't care at all about the base.

This must be your first time? Here is what I have learned: Sec experts are always going on about how my password fuckfuck is weak and needs to be more complicated like D8xj to be safe. But every fucking time I got a compremise, it wasn't because there was a team of leet hackers brute forcing my shit and compiling a GUI in visual basic, but a site poorly salting their shit -- if at all -- and it getting released with the rest of the users. 
Instead, I have adopted a tiered system: A master PW for my primary e-mail incase I ever need to recover another PW. Only the Google knows this PW, and that's it. Well, I guess Chrome knows it too because I save it, but I digress. Then I have 2 PW's I use for more serious sites, like my Universities login and bank. Then I have another for less than serious sites, like Reddit and the others. Then there is my dump PW which I use for every site that just demands I create an acct with them so I can see a picture or DL a car.

I know right? That's what blows me away. That 1.3 is a whole lot and really adds up. They don't only collect off each trade either, they collect cash off each withdraw. These Magic the Gathering owners are making tons of money, yet their site is still stuck seemingly 4 years in the past with a broken UI and glitchy market tools.
Seriously. Just a few days ago they made 200k USD in BTC. Wtf are they doing with that money? I know the server doesn't require even a fraction of that to run. How about they use, maybe 20k, get a college student, and upgrade the site a bit.

5 million USD was seized by the US government, not the whole 500million in BTC. However, there is a possibility that these rogue agents may have something to do with the money dissapearing. There are too many holes in the story to know for sure.

Jesus Christ dude, you sound so fucking toxic and angry. There are MULTIPLE avenues to go about. Raising awareness, for starters helps, because that builds public support for change, which gets more people involved with the effort. Secondly, there are things like taking it to the courts, lobbying local legislative changes to support higher changes, direct vote amendments, and so on...
@_date: 2011-06-14 07:37:09
Well bitcoin is so anonymous a blacklist would be moot. Essentially this is what you would do:  
Create a new wallet for mtgox. Make your transactions there. Then, just to be safe, from there you send those coins to another throwaway wallet. Then that wallet sends it to your savings or personal wallet. It can never ever ever ever be tracked back to you that way. As long as that second throwaway isnt tied to a website that logged your ip and connected it with that wallet, it's impossible for them to trace it. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 00:12:02
This case just gets juicier. Turns out, the person claiming to dox a bunch of vendors (and end up getting a hit set out for himself) was actually the Fed... but it was also a rogue fed who actually was trying to use that information for personal monetary gain.

How do you guys ensure that no one will chargeback their card?
@_date: 2016-05-08 09:37:51
It's not as easy as just "voting them out". There are many avenues people use to leverage change within our government, and simply voting people out is an incredibly difficult task, especially for a single issue. 
It requires TREMENDOUS amounts of work, just for a slight shot at succeeding. Then what happens when you fail? Just accept it? What happens when you do replace them, but the other candidate doesn't care? What happens if you are lucky to get a candidate who cares, but can't convince enough politicians?
You so casually think institutional changes are just as simple as voting, when it's so much more complex than that. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 19:42:07
Then they probably shouldn't include it. Adding the money turns the transaction from philanthropic transaction to an economic transaction. The money shifts the context of the incentives -- which happen to be low incentives.   
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:21:02
Quicky:  
Remember the SR episode? Remember the part where someone was trying to blackmail DPR by threatening to release information on a ton of vendors unless DPR paid him? Turns out, that the extortion was done by an FBI agent using information they got off the arrest of a vendor. However, it wasn't FBI sanctioned. He just used the info to get some money on the side to line his pockets. Even DPR tried to get a hit on him.
Turns out, they stole a BUNCH of money off SR during the investigation and used this to invest into multiple things. Then the agent would forge documents from the FBI to help launder money around. Then went as far as to even order shutdowns and stuff on other BTC companies he didn't like.
Now it's looking like he had something to do with MtGox going down, because Gox wouldn't partner up with him and help him hide his money, so it is looking like he was behind the pressure to get their money seized. This seizure lead to MtGox start it's downward spiral. 
So it's starting to look like these guys were ALL OVER the BTC scene, using their inside information and leverage to make all sorts of money by ripping people off and using their legal privileges to do so. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 22:44:40
They were part of a movement. I was just telling OP that it's not fair to chastise people for making it sound as simple as just voting people out.

@_date: 2015-10-23 22:35:54
Oh now you're playing semantics. There is a big difference. Research has shown the difference between these types of transactions. For instance say you're friend asks you for a favor to help him with a big move.  You do and in return he gets a bunch of beer and you chill and drink. And all is good. 
But what happens when instead he says thanks and gives you 30 bucks for the help. The cash has now changed the nature of the transaction and the 30 bucks is a tiny amount for all the work done that it's almost insulting. 
These experiments have been done before and it's pretty clear. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:46:24
No one is denying it's a good idea... He's just saying it's a waist of effort. It takes a lot of work to prep something like this, and you'll need at MINIMUM 10% of the ENTIRE Coinbase user pool to take part in the high effort activity.
If anything, it's MORE risky to do this, because all it's going to do is get people to move their coins around and expose themselves by withdrawing their coins into potentially risky environments. If anything, I'd think that this is an effort pushed by hackers who have a bunch of people compromised waiting for them to withdraw. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 09:34:02
Of course... However, there are multiple issues at hand here, all of which vary in significance, but are significant none-the-less... Also, until we correct a dejure corrupt system, we should still be worried about laws that come in which just further enable their corruption. 
Yes, we should focus on the corruption, but yes, we should also still worry about these laws until the institutional corruption is remedied (LOL).

It's my job to sell solar so I didn't tell him he could get it cheaper than the 13.5c retail rate... He could switch to time of use and for 20 hours of the day, get electricity at half that, or switch to a commercial plan, and negotiate something else. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 11:06:14
I completely get that. I'm just trying to say, that "vote people out!" is not as simple as it seems. In fact, it's probably one of the least effective as there are far more useful channels and strategies... At least that's my experience with working in politics. Sure, voting people in that are good, are great, but often good candidates aren't available to be voted for, or have an extremely unlikely shot at beating the incumbent. 
Education is definitely the most basic foundation before anything else can get done. Once people are educated, then they can rally around actually organizing and pushing for change. So don't get pissed at those who don't want to invest all their waking life into making political change (because that's literally what it takes in politics), but doesn't mind helping spread awareness, which will hopefully pick up more people who are passionate with free time to jump in. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:41:39

It's not 100% conclusive, obviously, but to be proven guilty, you just need to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. There is little room for reason here. Everything is pointing directly in his direction. It doesn't seem likely that all these things happened just by chance, and he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. If he's not DPR himself, he's personally working close with the real DPR. But nothing is suggesting there was another high level guy working closely with him.

Yeah, I've looked into them before. However, no accelerator is going to fund a single person. I need to find a smart tech partner. My programming is not at a high enough level to secure a financial backend.

@_date: 2013-06-12 19:21:54

Oh I have developed a pitch, I just didn't know I was pitching it. Could you give me more advice on how I'd raise funding for a project like this? In theory, I could personally probably develop a skeletal, yet functioning platform. However, to product itself wouldn't be able to launch without funding. To actually get BTC to work with Visa, you need to give Visa financial security before they will allow me to become a partnered service provider. 
I understand investors want to see an MVP that can be scaled out, however, it's simply not possible without at least some seed funding to get any traction at all. 
However, I am confident there is A LOT of demand for this service. It's been talked about for ages, but for whatever reason, never actually launched. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:36:15
We're unlikely going to see this with BTC ever again. Raising from 5 dollars to 50, is much easier, than 50 to 500. Now, these 10x gains may happen with BTC in the future, but it's going to take much much longer. The amount of money being spent into BTC is going to be HUGE if you just as so much want to see a double gain.

No, his personal email address rossulbricht -- The email address he used early on when trying to recruit people, and the email address that was still regularly being used by him. The gmail access logs show him accessing his account through the same private VPN IP used for autologging into SR server as an administrator. Also the only record left on the VPN was the last login. This login was from an internet cafe near his house. The same IP that accessed that VPN is also the same IP that accessed his gmail accounts.

If I had to put on my tin foil hat, I'd say the Winklevoss twins just unloaded their stash. I can't think of many other people that have that kind of volume. Maybe they got bad news from today's senate meeting?

This is exactly why I don't think BTC will ever become mainstream. No one wants to deposit their paycheck into a currency that can either go up 20% in a month, or down 20%... It's just not reliable. This is why BTC is mainly used as an investment, due to its inherent volatility. 
As much as I love the idea of decentralized fiat currencies, there doesn't seem to be a way to prevent these wild price fluctuations. 
BTC does certainly have its place in society, and I'm actually strongly considering starting up something that I think will help bring it closer to mainstream society. But I don't think it will EVER be able to replace a regulated currency.

Obviously not since it's still up. However, if they had a 0-day to find the real IP of the Freedom Host servers, they can probably do the same with SR, which I don't doubt they are trying to do. 
My guess, however, is SR is hosted in Russia, so they wont make much progress there.

Perfectly understandable. The blockchain was being linked around during the day/following day of the bust on various sub threads. A quick google search brought up nill. So I dunno. Maybe someone else can chime in. I'm off to eat so I don't have the time to sift through all the posts looking for it.

Whenever, without fail, whenever the volume of coins on the market for sell, is half of that of people willing to buy (in regards to the mtgoxlive chart), it goes up. This is simple supply and demand. There just aren't people willing to sell cheap coins. 
Right now there is an artificial paywall at 17.39, so subtract that. It's just for looks. Keep looking at it. If it stays like this for another 3 days. I'll be betting 2k it will go up. I saw the same thing 5 months ago when it was at 5, and put in 1k, which turned into 2k for me. Now I'm going to bet on it again.

He down votes are because he can't take them to court. They paid him back with interest. Plus he's not in the charity business to give up his time to sue a company for a small amount of money just to make a point.

I wish I did. I'm getting down voted for even bringing it up without a link. I'm on mobile right now, but I saw it floating around the days after in the silkroad sub.

Yeah, I'm one of those that lost about 5k BTC when they were worth pennies :\

Still may be a good time to sell. This WILL induce panic selling and drop the price significantly lower. While MtGox may no longer be the trade platform leader, it still is the gold standard that people use to watch the market.

Where the hell are all these BTC investors, and how can I find them?

Exactly. It would be reasonable to have some doubt whether or not he's DPR. However, once you start coordinating the IP logs, the email address, the fact that it was a private VPN that wasn't shared, and so on... It's less reasonable to doubt that he's just unlucky. It's more reasonable to think they are the same people.

nearly double value jump in just a few days. Yup, this is a bubble. The Silk Road news gave a ton of exposure to BTC, so all these new hordes of people are coming in.

BTC Will never become a dominant currency, however, it does have it's place as an alt currency. If you can open it up to being usable in places that don't accept alts, then you're in a good place.

Before they officially started shipping, a mysteriously HUGE spike in the hashrate came online... I'm sure they were part of that. I mean, wouldn't you, for at least a few days before shipping them out? It's a figurative money tree.

There is ASICminer which is sort of what your saying. Not really, but kinda.

Oh totally, and I'm sure the Fed Gov knows this, but they are required to do their job. 
A billion dollar industry doesn't just sit there. People will try to get a share of that, no matter what. Just like what happened when they shut down Napster, except this time there is money to be made.

It'll be interesting, that's for sure. A lot of people that sold out at 80 after the crash are looking at this, and have learned not to panic sell. 
I'm sure we are on our way to a mini bubble at the moment, and it will likely crash a bit. However, how low? People are going to be less willing to part ways. Keep in mind, just 2 weeks ago it hit 112 USD, and now it's back up to 180. It's certainly too volatile and we are likely going to start having another crazy ride.
I've cashed out, personally, because I don't want to get involved with all this risky business, and am speculating on buying back in after the correction.

Well I'm sure he hasn't kept it entirely secret. I'm sure he's told people close to him. You know, like friends and such. But those people respect him enough not to reveal his identity.

Have you not seen the 600k address? After he got busted an address started amassing coins from all over the place to over 600k. Then, they all left. 
I'm sure if you google it you can find it.

That was poorly worded. I'm referring to DPR. He's the leader of his industry. So when he talks about his industry, what he has to say means much more than what Joe-Shmoe from the internet has to say about that industry.
