First time I've heard of side chains... sounds like a great idea. Does it mean the miners have to be aware of all compatible blockchains? 
I.e. if you send some meowcoin to the bitcoin blockchain, in order for this transaction to be entered on the blockchain presumably the bitcoin miners will have to be monitoring the meowchain to verify the meowcoin funds have been properly "reserved" on the meowchain, and that a sufficient number of confirmations have elapsed?
If I invented a new side-chain tomorrow called penicoin would the sidechain mechanism let me start transacting between the two blockchains immediately or would the bitcoin miners all have to agree to support the new chain and update their software?
Would malicious actors be able to make a bazillion side-chains to overload the miners, as each miner will have to be simultaneously syncing all those alt-coin blockchains?
If I maliciously designed my alt-coin with vulnerabilities in it, or engineered a situation where I could fork my chain at will, could this cause problems or introduce weak points into the bitcoin blockchain? Or would I just be committing side-chain seppuku?
Presumably, all side-chain currencies have to be pegged to the value of BTC, so any alt-coins subscribing to this scheme would have to revalue themselves when they side-link? Meaning wholesale updates to mining &amp; wallet software at the moment of the merge?
I think I'm starting to understand just from asking questions, but I'll post this anyway ��

If they ban encryption, they will have to ban random numbers, as there's no way to differentiate the two. Formatting a hard drive by writing random data over it would be illegal. Recording apparently random radio telescope signals (like SETI) would be illegal. Twitching due to a nervous tick would be illegal. This is just another way for the British police to arbitrarily detain suspects.

When I checked a few months ago, the ad banners / promoted content at the top of pages couldn't be bought with bitcoin, but the square ads in the sidebars could, as they were organised through a third party. Has that changed now?
