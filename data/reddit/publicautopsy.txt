It makes him a supporter of the group that the person represents, because this is party politics supporting that person supports control of the government by that group.

If you support Rand Paul, one of the more insane Republicans, then you support the republican party.
@_date: 2015-05-21 01:25:10
I'm honestly embarrassed to be associated with a community as right-wing insane as bitcoins. I feel the same way about guns, having grown up around them and safe use of them I see no problem with responsible gun ownership, but fuck if I'll tell anyone that cause that community is so tightly associated with a toxic side effect / sub group of american culture.
Its been a fun ride but yeah I'm out of the bitcoin scene officially.

The blind love for republicans in this thread has convinced me I dont belong on this subreddit or in the bitcoin community any more. As a member of the community and developer for years now its really disheartening how most of you people are still blindly going to vote against your interests cause its wrapped in "libertarianism" which is a joke of a political philosophy. 
@_date: 2011-12-01 07:30:22
How acurate is the assertion that people are getting hacked for their bitcoins? I've not heard of any specific incidents, only the same sort of claim. 
Also, I dont believe hacking would be the source of bitcoins coming to an end, that just seems asinine 
@_date: 2011-12-01 07:24:55
It never let me see the yubikey before, always was prompted with a login box but it never worked, so I thought it was new 
@_date: 2011-12-01 03:21:40
Yeah, I clicked on the little graph icon on the left and was like "Oh damn!" haha 
@_date: 2011-12-01 03:49:24
People change, maaaan. 
@_date: 2011-12-02 22:13:32
Everything's updated, made sure of that, even uninstalled VC++ re-downloaded and reinstalled it. 
@_date: 2011-12-01 07:23:56
My main contention was that the background is so... amateur.
@_date: 2013-04-29 04:07:38
Currently, yes, it only lets you send to people who are using the same 'client.' We are on a plane right now hacking away solutions for this.
Also what bitcoin cant do normally is send over SMS, which the entire platform runs on. You send send and request bitcoins entirely over SMS. This is to accomodate for people who do not have smart phones or consistent access to computers, like in developing nations. 
EDIT: I'm one of the developers
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:02:53
Thanks, hope you enjoy it!
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:32:33
I reccomend 10 minutes ago...
@_date: 2013-04-29 06:46:04
It is a hackathon project for TCDisrupt NY 2013, we built it in 24 hours total, and we should have this feature up by tomorrow afternoon
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:50:48
Everybody interested in bitcoins and Disrupt 2013 should check out the application my team made at the hackathon there, Bits at [paywithbits.com](
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:32:10


Yes. Yes it is. And you're delusional if you think otherwise.
If you think that 150% growth in a week is sustainable, you must have never had looked at a long term price chart. 
EDIT: 
@_date: 2013-03-01 05:32:02
You don't buy on the top of a bubble... That's just common sense.
@_date: 2013-04-29 07:10:55
We did test, we spent all day testing it with random folks we met and testing internally through a TDD system. We are still building the feature to send bit coins from phone number to wallet is all, the service is still completely usable.
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:03:37
You can use it entirely right now, the only part of the service still beign developed is sending bitcoins back out of the system, which hsould be up in a couple days
@_date: 2013-03-01 15:12:37
Go for it.
@_date: 2013-04-29 08:17:18
Ooohhhh! I'll take note of that! Thank you
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:45:47
We built the service from the ground up to be an SMS to SMS payment system for bitcoin, this differes from coinapult where you can (from a web interface) send somebody bitcoins to their mobile phone number and thats about it. 
With Bits you are given a wallet that is associated with your phone number, which allows you to send, receive, and request bitcoins from other people, with confirmations tied to all of those services. 
Also, I feel like this is worth mentioning that it is fully international and was designed to work from the simplest of phones with SMS capabilities as to provide access to bitcoins on a day to day level to people in developing nations, wherein a smartphone running dedicated bitcoin software would probably never exist.
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:47:42
It was modeled slightly off of bitcointip, mostly the command interface/syntax, but coinapult, we dont think so, see my response below about how our service differs.
@_date: 2013-04-29 07:55:26
None so far! We may incorporate a small fee at a later date to cover api costs, but probably nothing noticeable
Also, thank you for enjoying it, we think it's pretty cool
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:08:08
Also keep in mind the time the transactions take to be confirmed by the block chain, this may also have to do with the lag time of what you see in your balance
@_date: 2013-03-01 06:01:28
Feelings? Followed bit coin for about 3 years now, seen some similar activity and anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together would tell you that its a sellers market (understatement) right now. This bubble will probably pop down to ~10$ and this gentleman is going to be out a sum of money. 
Wrong time to buy for sure.
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:31:14
Hey, im one of the developers and original conceptor for paywithbits, Cody Byrnes, AMA! (I might not respond right away cause I'm on a plane home from NY right now)
@_date: 2013-05-11 03:52:03
You can pay by SMS with my app Bits! Check it out at PayWithBits.com
@_date: 2013-04-29 03:58:38
Once you signup you can then send "address" which will send you a bitcoin address to which you can send coins to. Please please please do not put a large amount into the system though for your own sake. We made this in under 24 hours at disrupt and not everything is perfect. For example we are still working on the ability to remove bitcoins from your account. 
This feature should be in, within the next couple of days and then you can feel free to use it at your leisure. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 00:00:54
Currently yeah, have your friend text 'signup' to 1-415-675-1348 and then feel free to use it. 
We are working on an invite system and the ability to send to numbers that arent currently in the system currently
@_date: 2013-03-01 06:03:41
Even if your buying long term its a horrible time to buy.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:41:06
I still wouldnt bank on it lol 
@_date: 2013-04-29 08:45:37
You can send pictures through MMS which is a different protocol, again, another solution we will be looking into, possibly a short code system and other solutions as well
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:07:03
The emerging markets in developing worlds that dont necessarily have a trust worthy fiat system was my main inspiration for this platform! ANd yeah, your idea sounds awesome! have you looked into localbitcoins.com? It provides a similar service.
I have only just heard of Mpesa, and im not quite clear on  what it does, please inform me of what exactly its for. 
And yeah, resistance against bitcoin is universal! So we are fine to meet that level of resistance
@_date: 2013-04-29 04:14:37
Yes, very much so! Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:34:44
Yeah... Totally
@_date: 2013-04-29 06:11:30
It seems simple, but consider the use case of a Nokia feature phone, a.k.a. the most popular phones on earth, that would have no ability to deal with qr and typing in a full address without error would be high impossible.
Just a note, we do fully intend this feature but we are still trying to get a better solution as well
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:36:06
Why on earth would you buy at the all time high of 900? 
@_date: 2013-05-06 04:19:57
I'll be there! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:34:42
Not looking likely
