check my math please 
according to 
current hash rate is 101E 
which I was like wtf is E? so i went to google it and its exa, 10^18
so 101 x 10^18 x 600=
6.06e+22; into the sextillions if im correct

does this mean there are that many possible hashes as well or is the total possible more than the average hashes it takes?

i thought it wasn't divisible infinitely though, like a btc can only be divided to 8 decimal places (0.00000001).

how do we know electrum doesn't store a copy of the private key since isn't the private key generated with electrum?

i think some are running asics as well, idk specifically but lets say some hobbyist that really knew what he was doing blew 10k on a home sized operation with the most efficient operation possible, would it still be possible to go for a whole block? or would you have better luck blowing 10k on lottery tickets?

ok so as time goes on, the time it takes to mine one block will always be constant, but the reward will keep on shrinking until it is 0, and by then miners will basically be working for the tx fee of each block instead of the reward right?

yea just cuz someone knows about btc and the darknet means they have an adequate technical understanding of the intricacies of how crypto currency works. "I bought some weed off silkroad so now I know everything about crypto" gtfo bro

why do larger ops tend to be more profitable?
