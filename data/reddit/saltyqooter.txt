Alright profit takers take your sell orders off and let the price climb, take your profit around like 12k so we can have the FOMO kick in to counter the sells and stabilize there for a little bit

Same! When you take all the averages of my buys ranging from the lowest at like 4.5k to the highest being 16.4k and everything in between. So yes people, PUSH!

That’s why I always do limit orders for buying and selling unless the market is dropping or going up extremely quick and I can’t get an order In where I’m comfortable

I watch it basically all day except when things come up and I can’t, but so far I’ve been pretty fortunate either way no matter what the strategy of any trader we all get bent over from time to time unless you’re a true HODLer 
Just gotta have more positive trades than negative at the end of the day, tbh I’m really just in it for the rush anyways any money gained is a plus and any money lost can be made again. I’m not rich and don’t ever intend to be

It’s the same company, but if you sell it on GDAX you will have to pay about a quarter of the fees for the actual sale if you do limit sales instead of just being able to sell for market on Coinbase

On here I see just about everyone looks at the charts and the index’s and stuff like that more than anything it sounds like. I look at the book more than anything when trading and I day trade, usually like 2-4 buys and sells a day and I usually always take a profit even if only a couple of dollars or I sell/buy neutral to be on the safe side if I don’t feel comfortable with predicting which way the market is gonna go. Just curious if people watch the book more, less, or about the same as the charts and RSI and trend lines and stuff?

Set your parameters, don’t get greedy. Actual profit is always better than the unknown in my opinion.

Anyone else sell around 9400 and buy back in around 9700 yesterday? Fml, I shoulda waited like I usually do for the dip but the FOMO got to me when 10k was so close but so far away
