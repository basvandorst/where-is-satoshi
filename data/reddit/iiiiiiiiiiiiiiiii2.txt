I suspect bitfinex has some influence here. The ability to go short can make markets more stable. The value of BTC was ore stable while bitcoinica was operating.

I agree. Japan has lax money laundering laws. The egold guy got put out of business by the Feds.

The guy who ran btcdeals.com in 2011 had a very similar business model. He discovered that it is a customer service hassle when some orders take eight weeks and some orders don't arrive. Also chancers who will claim their order didnt arrive in the hope of free stuff.

In my opinion the period of stability around $5 was a good thing. I think that bitcoinica had a lot to do with it.
It's time to think about going short. Is there a way of betting on the value of BTC going down that isn't ludicrously likely to result in all the money getting stolen?

There is no evidence to support that, just another wild theory. That would have been a really high risk strategy for bitcoinica.

Isn't *The great simoleon caper* by the same author, written in 1995,  a story entirely about some super techie person creating a financial system that governments can't track or control?
If i remember correctly it's much closer to reality than the fantasy 3d virtual reality internet in snowcrash.

Stuff posted direct from Cineese suppliers, dealextreme and others.
As I recall, they had a single offer on the site which changed every day or two.
I only remember a few, they offered a small box which you connected to a USB harddrive and plugged into your network. It make the harddrive appear as a network drive. A cheap low power alternative to leaving a server computer on. 
Sometimes it was cheap stuff like USB flash drives or HDMI cables.
Before Halloween they had offered a screaming skull LED door ornament thing. I remember that because it was awful, tacky, fairly expensive and I wondered who in their right mind would waste money on it.
You can look at the discussions from the time in the bitcointalk forums.
