Come back to $3500 next week lol.  
You underestimating hundreds of scammers who figured out that it’s virtually impossible to lose money when you manipulate shorts on bitmex combined with fake futures contracts.
There won’t be massive bull run until bitmex get raided by feds and futures start closing for actual physical bitcoin. This is another bull trap

He’ll be fine. every grandma knows that shorting on bitmex is literally free money. Bears on parade and they have nothing to lose because regulations not there and they safely short knowing they can manipulate price on bitmex in their favor since they’re not buying physical btc from longs when they win.
Bitmex is literally cancer killing crypto right now and only lazy fatass doesn’t make money shorting when everyone knows bitmex shorting is basically free money loophole. Once SEC steps in with regulations and bitmex ceo get raided for fraud by Interpol we might see bull run again but you’ll know when that happens by sudden spike or inside traders week before

Your friend is shorting margin on BitMEX. This is literally free money right now.
BTC settled futures IS killing the BTC price and it will continue until the volume drys up on BTC settled futures.
The BitMEX platform's derivatives are especially harmful to unregulated markets as these futures are settled in asset (BTC) instead of fiat.
When a contract settles or is sold on a BTC settled futures platform, the winner gets BTC (both short and long winners get BTC). The spot (fiat) market controls the settlement price and cannot be bought up with BTC. It can ONLY be sold down with BTC
In a normal market there would be competing long traders offsetting the short traders. These long traders would be attempting to manipulate the spot up and therefore profit from their futures contract longs. This cannot happen in a BTC settled futures market without massive outside cash reserves. There is no way for a long trader to make fiat in order to buy the spot market up, they can only make BTC. The manipulation process ONLY works to the downside on BitMEX BTC settled futures. Since BitMEX is far and away the most volume, there is no competition for the short manipulators.
The manipulation cycle works like this:
They shorted futures, then dumped their BTC on the spot market causing their short futures positions to be profitableThey then close some futures and are paid in BTC from the people who took the 'long' side of the contract.They open more short futures contracts and then dump the BTC they just earned on the spot market Finex, Stamp, Coinbase causing the new short futures contracts to be profitable.If the volume was dominated on spot exchanges or on fiat settled futures exchanges then long/short competition would be offset as there would be the long side trying to manipulate the price up on the spot exchanges by the same process described here. BitMEX owning the most volume and settling futures in BTC, results in a structural advantage to shorts. This results further in manipulation of the BTC price to the downside.
 When a short seller profits- they have more Bitcoin and cheaper Bitcoin to sell against. It's not the same for someone who goes long, as Bitcoin is more expensive after profit is realized.  
Not to mention, someone who is long can only make so much BTC profit. If Bitcoin goes to infinity, profits on a long are 1/entry price \* number of contracts. If Bitcoin goes to zero, shorters would theoretically earn infinite BTC.
