Are you still interested ?  Send me a mail with your website.. and I'll set up your account and mock an integration for you.

Your site seems to be more like an aggregator, isn't it ?
If you had your own content, I'd suggest running a porous paywall (or payfence), giving up 3 or 4 articles, then showing up the payfence, and waiting for the payment to arrive before automatically refreshing the page.
If you'd like to try it with my service, I'd be more than happy to sort out the kinks with you. I understand though that you are quite technical and you'd implement that on your own, right ?  Anyway.. if you want to help me out, and test the model for yourself, we could partner up in some way.  Check out the site.. bitcredits.io

It's like shuffling a big deck of cards with friends, with everyone searching for one card. The first to put the card on the table wins ~3000 $. Then we start again. The more players, the bigger the card deck.
Wouldn't you play ? ;-)

BitCredits.io has already done an integration for Shopify. See yetisolar.com to see an example of how it works... its a very slick integration and allows you to start earning bitcoins today.
Also, you don't need to sacrifice credit card payment for it to work.

Yeah.. be there !  I will.

lol :) sorry! I'm bad at it
@_date: 2013-07-16 03:53:08
I know it's a shameless plug.  I have no clue where to start to get the thing known and improved.  Any ideas ?

hey folks.. I just launched a platform to do just that.
It's a paywall / payfence as a service.. back by bitcoin only.. and allows people to access online content in a never-before-seen frictionless manner.
If you use a phone as your wallet.. you'll see that the experience is quite revolutionary.   It's similar to bitfetch, but served as an API for any website to integrate.
Since I'm such a little startup trying to start something new, I'd really appreciate any feedback you guys can provide.
oh, btw, it's named bitcredits.io !  there's a demo up.. if you pay to try it out.. welll... hmm.. consider it a donation ? :)
