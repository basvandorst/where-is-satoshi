I don't think so. I think they knew they were in deep shit, but by accepting deposits, they tried to shift funds around internal to keep the boat floating a little longer in the hopes that some miracle would happen that could save gox. Sure, that is fraudulent and they were ponzi-scheming their customers, but I doubt it was with malicous intent.

There's no one to blame but one's self if you stockpile your coins in a wallet that you don't have the private key to.
I'm using BTC-e for day-trading yes, but I'd never ever store a majority of my coins there...
BTC-e may be shady, but far less so than Mt.Gox and I'm not the one who's coins vanished from under my fingers.
Sorry if you lost coins on Gox, that is unfortunately what happens if you trust your wealth to untrustworthy people.

I don't know how much BTC you have left, if you have none: If you can make a bot that works good and reliably for btc-e maybe we can work something out

Thanks to fractional reserve banking, even private banks can create money from nothing without a problem..

Rewrite it for btc-e or mcxnow or other exchanges. Maybe you can recover your losses. .21 btc isn't the world.

Seems like my previous post wasn't saved so I'll resubmit:
Next time you send some BTC off to the wrong address, make sure it's mine: 1D3rriAL4Zx4y4ziAxNUzV9YDD8dpkMupW
Also thank you for your 800 btc donation to the Bitcoin network. You will be remembered.

Sorry for all your losses, but signs of Gox' insolvency and internal unrest were already visible as much as a year ago. Thats when I pulled out and started using BTC-e.
Good luck to everyone who lost all their money, you'll survive the AGoxalypse.

Remember when Gox was DDoS'd and the price went down from 266 to whatever it was (70 or something I believe) and people reported having trouble to withdraw their money from Gox? That kinda signs.

yeah right, continue believing that mate ;)

To a group of criminals who will most likely slowly trickle the BTC back into the remaining exchanges and slowly sell it to avoid devaluing the Bitcoin.

Because the real Satoshi is anonymous for a reason. And what does this have to do with them? It's not like this will have any effect on bitcoin, other than possibly creating some insecurity in the market. In fact it would not be bad for the real satoshi to have a believable scapegoat.

Am I the only one who thinks that this guy might start talking about winning and tigerblood at any moment?
