Very interesting. A large company dealing with huge volumes can’t have few of their own people contributing to the development.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:32:35
Done!!! hooray!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:31:58
How many more posts do you need to educate about the LN development and test status? Don’t be so ignorant, why don’t you simply lookup on the internet or do a simple search here?

@_date: 2017-08-15 01:25:35
Thank you. I have read 80% of the "Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies" book and I am so fascinated! 
Every time bitcoin rises, I see it as an encouragement to the whole science of cryptography. 
Also, I would suggest people to hold on to an algorithm that would generate the keys based on the mnemonic phrases, so they don't have to spend $$$$ to others when the original wallet app goes down or something.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:05:25
That was it! Thanks for pointing that out. I successfully transferred btc with 0 fee to an external address.
