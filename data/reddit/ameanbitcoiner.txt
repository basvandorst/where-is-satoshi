What was that company...neo something? That jacked up the trust factor for btc over there.  Always something working against it.

Not sure what you mean by double spend. I received not spent.  Forgive my lack of understanding

This is where MAIDSAFE steps in.

I actually like this feature.

How do I go about creating my own coin with special features such as an automated tax deduction at the end of a fiscal year that would go to any organization that I decide?

Expect much my friend.  If gov't are taking it serious and influential people are on it, it means there is something to this. The blockchain is badass. It is always good to do your research. I spent over 6 monthes just analyzing its strengths and weaknesses.  There are many podcasts explaining almost everything and websites such as khan academy that will get into the nitty gritty of cryptography.  All this helped boost my confidence as I hope it will yours.

Circle is already in talks with facebook and the IMF so they are going to be everything you dont like in an exchange.

I do Have a blockchain.info 2FA but i made sure i was on the right one. I will be in touch with coinbase tomorrow afternoon if it persists. Its just with everything going on that got on my nerves.

I lost a password on blockchain.info and was out half a bitcoin at that time $450! I dont use their wallet anymore. I simply dont trust my self not to lose a password.

The space is being volunteered  by a bitcoin enthusiast.

My kids are 3, 7, 8 and receive weekly allowance in fiat and monthly allowance int BTC.

I cant even stand the word wallet. That very word needs to be revamped. Did people used to keep there money behind walls and the some genius handed them a leather pouch and called it a wall-et.

Awesome. We are witnessing a "code battle"! Spittin lines of code. In your face counterparty. Let the games begin.

You are the man!
@_date: 2014-10-03 19:07:59
Wish that would translate into the price...
@_date: 2014-09-05 23:31:42
Well said!
@_date: 2014-06-16 12:13:22
Agreed.  I cannot see the future being a QR code world. Scanning an account like you would produce doesn't seem to fit with what we are trying to accomplish.

Hello.Bitcoiner here.  Started a consulting agency in detroit. I used to be a cash consultant now a bitcoin consultant.  It has rekindled my passion for currency. My number one issue is that I have a million passwords I have to keep track of. When im introducing bitcoin I am also teaching them about where to go and what to do and im constantly flipping through my password notepad logging into coinbase, bitpay, circle, bitstamp, ripple, etc...When clients see me do this it looks awfully intimidating. Then also setting them their 2 factor authentication.  Cryptocurrency is difficult to understand as it is to the noob. Is there a better way? Thanks.

Seriously WHAT year is it? Faucets?  Invest in small increments every week and the returns will make you happy:)
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:22:09
A great  ending. Bravo! Hopefully a great start  to a wonderful year.

Andreas has been the voices of reason through all the shit we have gone threw. Calling him  an idiot is harsh. A little to optimistic  maybe. But  He Was And Is THERE For The Community

This was supposed to be the year of innovation 2015 is supposed to be the year we get to use the DAC's. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 05:43:22
Thanks for the heads up. Now I just have to find where I put them all.
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:07:24
Don't forget that there will be more transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:13:56
We have litecoin that uses it isn't that enough of a test?  
@_date: 2018-07-21 13:20:28
August 16th is the real date I've heard.  Plus they might kick it down the road
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:41:04
I all heard was: when bitcoin gets to $10,000.  :)
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:24:40
Decentralize-everything or regulate I'm tired of this shit.
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:23:29
Funcking exchanges.  WTF
