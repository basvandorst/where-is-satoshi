Take a look at the 1Y chart.  Has there really been enough news to justify a 1000% increase?

I'm not entirely worried until BTC drops below $10k for an extended period of time.  In the last week it's been under that mark for 3-4 hours total.

Realistically think of what a bank is offering.
* A place to store your cash that is, for the vast majority, safe and free of loss
* Provides you with a card or checks to allow you to use that money even thought it is not physically on your person
* Allows you to go to one of thousands of places anywhere in the country (and the world) and convert it to cash
All of those things take a considerable amount of capital to provide.
Now, I'd love to be able to choose those features a la carte... because I don't need most.  But the idea that the bank is going to hold your cash and allow you access for free with all those benefits?

Wow, BTC broke $10k...

All you're saying is there's a lot of volatility in BTC right now.  We should wait to see overarching trends emerge before allowing one side to declare victory.

It sounds great but no crypto can handle the sheer quantity of transactions unfortunately. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 04:18:11
There are millions of transactions per day. Block chain technology, as it stands, cannot fill that void.

You mean except for the capital you have to invest in the mining equipment?  Then you also can't forget the actual operational costs in the form of increased electrical usage...

You'd think a writer for cnbc.com would understand what a "dead cat bounce" is...

As a gamer, I would *never* buy a GPU that was used for mining.  It'd have been run so hard for 24/7 (or long periods) that I'd worry how long it'd last.  Sure, not everyone is as educated but I wouldn't expect to get a lot out of resale.

That's why its a guess.  But take a look at the past week or month and you can see some macro trends.
And so long as you remember at what point you sold (say, $7500) and buy below that, you'll end up a bit ahead (just remember transaction fees!).

Or I could sell, wait for it to bottom out and buy then.  I'd actually end up with *more* BTC than if I just held.
At some point you should be looking for arbitrage opportunities.

I fully understand how mining works.  The point I was making is that if he doesn't want to take an investor's approach because he doesn't like tying up his assets, mining isn't much better because you tie up assets in the rig itself, plus additional expense from usage.
Mining might be close to free money, but its not *that* much.  The one advantage is that (in theory) you should rarely lose money unless you're not monitoring your costs.
