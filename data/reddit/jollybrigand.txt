Hey look! Those guys that really like bitcoin still like bitcoin!

As someone who ran a GPU mining rig that pulled in multiple whole BTC per day and sold them at ~$7, FOR FUCKS SAKE HODL.
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:01:27
In 2011/2012 a friend and I co-operated a GPU miner which sat in my closet. I "cashed out" by buying a Newegg gift card with my share.
Yesterday I was joking with some friends about this awful decision (as I do when Bitcoin reaches a new record value), and I decided to go back and look at it.
To my horror I found that the gift card I purchased for 26.03 BTC was **not even empty**. The remainder cost what would have been ~$15k USD at today's exchange rate.
I just bought myself a T-shirt.

Calling the word police right now. Hopefully they can apprehend these crooks and get my bitcoins back.
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:42:25
Tell your friend that another newegg card regretter sends his condolences.

I remember people saying it would never reach $100, then $1000. At this point I'm not going to try and guess what the upper limit will be.
(side note: can I buy your username for 26.03 BTC)
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:22:06
Yup. I got one of the super delayed Butterfly Labs ASICs (with cash, not BTC) and it absolutely didn't pay for itself.
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:36:10
huh ��
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:02:51
They didn't yet at the time.
@_date: 2017-06-07 23:30:57
The $1.93 was shipping on the order that I **used** the gift card on.
For anyone who is curious, I got a gaming headset and an HDMI cable. The headset is dead and gone now. I'm working on identifying which of my HDMI cables came from this order so I can focus my hatred on it.

Alas, isn't posting your address against the rules?

@_date: 2017-06-08 17:38:14
Right? I saw them this last October when they opened for Opeth in Seattle. Blew me away.

Hey, now you're part of an elite club made up mostly of rock stars!
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:37:09
 Yeah! This made my morning.
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:26:29
Oh god... I'm so sorry.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:34:23
Newegg never saw them. I got the gift card through a third party that was selling them for BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:19:13
At the time I sold all of it :_(
I got back into mining again a couple years later, but my returns were an order of magnitude lower and I didn't hold them.
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:56:38
I did???

�� best comment right here
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:23:47
Most likely any retailer will pin the value of your order to a fiat currency. They need to do this for their own accounting.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:48:26
You're welcome~! ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:44:02
Absolutely the right mindset for me right now. For now I'll spend a while strutting around in my $15,000 [shirt]( and laughing my ass off.
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:37:58
I've always wondered how tipping works... does the bot PM you a private key or something?
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:28:52
hahaHAHAHahahahaaaaa ��
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:43:31
Fuck yeah they do!
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:12:34
~5 years ago, yeah. Exchange rate was around $5 at the time.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:44:37
Yeah, nowhere near that much though.
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:20:51
That's what I tell myself so that I can sleep at night.
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:38:01
What have I done... D:
