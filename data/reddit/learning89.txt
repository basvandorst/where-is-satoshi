You must be insane, btc will NEVER be used as an everyday transaction money, too slow, too expensive, too centralized and controlled by China anyway, which can shut it down at any given time.
It will only remain a store of value (like gold) best case scenario, and DGB most likely will take over bitcoin as the real everyday (digital) currency.

Bullrun has historically been the year AFTER the halving, so next bull in 2021 if history repeats.

Exactly. BTC is old tech anyway. Slow and expensive.
Saying btc is king is like saying Myspace will always be king even after Facebook came up.
Also China owns at least 80% of the mining. When they decide to shut down BTC all these btc suckers will lose everything.
Decentralized is the future.

Next bullrun in 2021, because it’s always a year after the halving.

You BTC fan boys will bite the dust and cry like bitches when it gets shut down by China and DGB takes over it. Your btc will become useless when China says so.
Decentralized coins like DGB are the future of crypto.

And what does that mean? Good or not so good news??

Who said i was hodling it? BTC is old tech. I don’t own any. 0. None, nada.
China controls at least 80% of the mining. It’s pretty damn centralized as far as mining goes. China could pretty much shut it down at any moment. Which is why all my bags are elsewhere, mostly in DGB.

It’s actually the complete opposite, bitcoin’s use keeps falling since last year :

Halving is in summer 2020. What do you mean 3 to 8 months from now ?

But I thought ETF was rejected already the other day?? And the price did drop a little.
So what’s the hope for now?

But I thought the only reason BTC was king of crypto NOW was because most exchanges only accept btc to buy and trade altcoins.
Once fiat pairs are introduced for most altcoins then people won’t need to buy btc to get their alts, and only then we will see the TRUE crypto kings with better tech rise on top and maybe overthrow btc.
The mass introduction of fiat pairs will change the game. Also other alts surely have better technology than btc (in scalability, speed, cost etc).

By marketcap mainly. Like an alt with more institutional investment money than btc.
