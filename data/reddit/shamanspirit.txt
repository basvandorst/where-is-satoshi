Well I don't live there but I frequently visit Arnhem, the Netherlands, which has a remarkable number of businesses accepting Bitcoin.
And no, I'm not pretending by using Bitcoin-funded debit cards. Whenever I pay there, the shop owner shows me a QR code and I send an actual Bitcoin transaction from my iPhone, using [breadwallet](
Did I already mention it works flawlessly every single time? :)

If 80 GB traffic is a problem, you should not run a full node. Get real, it's 2016, a few GB per day is **nothing**.

I just paid dinner with Bitcoin. Earlier today I did some groceries with Bitcoin. And I got a new USB drive from my local computer shop with Bitcoin.

Let's not cripple Bitcoin because some people have too crappy internet connections. 
I fully agree Bitcoin should be available to the mass audience, but come on, the amount of data we're talking here is a piece of cake for any average random home internet connection.
And for the poor souls whose internet access can't even do a few GB per day, then in all honesty, they shouldn't run full nodes. They can still fully use Bitcoin, of course. 
Bitcoin is for everybody, but running a node is more than just using it, and there's nothing wrong with requiring at least something of a decent internet connection (and the bar is already extremely low there). Realize that these people also won't be able to use YouTube, for example. Way more data involved than Bitcoin.

Double what speed? Why do you care if your transaction confirms in 10 or 20 minutes. It's entirely the recipient's business, not yours. 
If you pay with Bitcoin, the transaction takes 1 second and that's it, you're done.
Do you consider credit card unusable because their settlement time is 6 months? No, you don't. You just pay with your credit card, and leave any worries about reversibility or chargeback risks to the merchant. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 21:47:04
OK, if you have to be like that.. Considering the fact that IQ is always expressed as an **integer**, "100" in fact represents a class covering the interval from 99.5 to 100.5 in the underlying N(μ=100,σ=15) distribution. The probability of a IQ class *below* 100 would then be ± 48.67%, i.e. *less* than half.
Anyway, you get my point. There's got to be only *one* person really smart or stupid in order to skew the average up or down, thus causing more than half of them to be stupider or smarter than average.

No reason whatsoever to run a full node. Try the mobile wallets I mentioned above, they work absolutely fine without storing a copy of the entire blockchain.

Seriously, have you tried any of the mobile wallets nowadays? 
Apps like [Mycelium]( or [breadwallet]( or [Copay]( are really a big step forward in userfriendlyness. 
Your parents are a good example. I sure as hell wouldn't trust my parents to keep money on an exchange, requiring them to remember passwords and all (especially not on their infected computers). They *do* use Mycelium, however. It's absolutely friction-free for them, and they're complete computer illiterates. 
Crap like remembering encryption passwords is something from the user-unfriendly geek-oriented high tech wallets. I (being a geek and all) use that in my linux offline cold storage containing 100+ bitcoins. Nothing like that in the mobile wallets I mentioned above. 
And they got a very simply, fool proof backup procedure too. 
Seriously, it works.

This is true for established currencies and commodities, like fiat and gold. Gold actually *was* used to buy things with it, in fact I think it was the de facto means of buying stuff for many centuries.
Bitcoin is not in that position, yet. Compared to other currencies and commodities, Bitcoin is still tiny. If everybody keeps it, and nodoby uses it, it will stay tiny.

First of all, full RBF would be the end of Bitcoin in Point of Sale. And you may like using Bitcoin for point of sale (e.g. a the cash register or shop counter) or not, but it's a very practical, real life application of Bitcoin. And it has been working perfectly and extremely secure so far. More importantly, real life 'face to face' payments in shops and business is a tremendous help in getting the general audience more aware of Bitcoin, thus stimulating mass adoption.
Second, how exactly would full RBF help? If there's too many transactions, there's too many transactions. Everybody replacing their txs with new ones won't reduce the overal number of transactions. Larger (or faster) blocks is what helps decreasing the backlog. Not the ability to replace pending transactions with new ones. 
You seem to think that bumping the fee on a tx will get it confirmed faster. If that were the case, everybody would do that. And we just end up with the same situation (more txs than can be processed) except now we're all paying more fees. 
Besides, if you're so concerned with getting a tx confirmed as soon as possible, then why not pay enough fee in the first place? This is just a simple calculation. There are tools that (taking the current mempool into account) can accurately calculate how much fee is necessary for your tx to get confirmed within X blocks with high probability. No need to tamper with existing txs in the mempool.
@_date: 2016-02-09 16:58:00


No, *every* node does the checks I mentioned. What miners do in addition, is puttin all these transactions together in one block of data, and brute forcing a hash for it. 
Try and propagate a transaction that spends outputs what were already spent in a previous tx (i.e. a double spend). You can create and sign such a transaction just fine. Now try to push it to the network. You'll find that *every* single node you try will reject your tx immediately.

blockchain.info is just a random website, which happens to show some Bitcoin related data.
Other than showing (not storing, let alone creating) data, it has nothing to do with the actual blockchain, the distributed ledger that is the core element of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not down, it has no outage, nothing is lost or broken. This website blockchain.info may be down (like any website) but it has nothing to do with the status of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-02-14 19:17:16
Maybe I should not have put this in parenthesis:


I suggest spend BTC whenever you can, but also to keep buying the same amount of BTC back on the market. Effectively it's the same: you gain some product or service, you lose some dollars, you keep your bitcoins. So I'm asking them to put less value on USD.
Except now, when spending + rebuying BTC instead of just paying with USD, you're also stimulating the BTC acceptance. The more BTC is actually being put to use in practice, the more it becomes known, gains attention, recognition, acknowledgement, and in the end mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2016-02-10 10:42:23
Sure, you're right, it's all to be seen in perspective and the exposure this got was probably mostly within the Bitcoin community.
Still, it received way more exposure and attention than it would ever had if Paypal hadn't done anything.
But I agree, it would be even better if more people *outside* the Bitcoin community would get to see this.
@_date: 2016-02-08 14:06:11


Actually, yes you can. Maybe in Coinbase you can't (when receiving coins from a non-Coinbase user) but the Bitcoin protocol itself certainly does not have this restriction. If you use a self-owned wallet like Mycelium or Breadwallet, you can receive bitcoins and spend them *immediately* (i.e. even when the incoming tx is still unconfirmed).
On a side note: (getting off topic but people may find this interesting to realize)


Bitcoin transactions are not national or international. Remember, you're not sending a transaction to anyone in particular. The essence of a Bitcoin transaction is broadcasting it to *everyone*. And it gets distributed throughout the world wide P2P network in a matter of seconds.
There is no specific receiver, therefore there is no receiver's location either. Whoever happens to have the private key of the address you're sending to, effectively has the bitcoins and can spend them. This may be multiple people, each having multiple copies of this private key, stored in multiple countries. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 19:21:38
If that were the case, miners could already exclude transactions with fees that are too low for their liking. If they have a monopoly in deciding what is the minimum fee for a transaction to get included, then bigger blocks would still be beneficial for them. More expensive transactions to process per 10 minutes. 
And mining is not expensive, nor cheap. Mining, by definition, will run approximately break even. If it were expensive, miners would quit and it would become less expensive. If it were cheap (i.e. profitable) more people would start mining and it would become more expensive. So **regardless of the actual cost** mining isn't expensive.
@_date: 2016-02-07 21:20:58
I agree we're certainly not there yet. But with mobile apps like the ones mentioned before ([Mycelium]( or [breadwallet]( or [Copay]( it's NOT limited to experts. 
These particular wallets require zero technical skill, and I'd argue they are **easier and safer** than keeping an account with some external service like Coinbase and storing money there. Also due to the fool proof backup function. Especially Mycelium (on Android) really nailed it. *Everybody* capable of using a smartphone gets that.
@_date: 2016-02-11 21:20:01
*Your* blockchain? There is just *one* blockchain, that's the whole idea of the consensus thing. And it's decentralized, so the blockchain is continuously accessed by IPs from all over the world.
Anyway there is no service or company behind the blockchain, it's just a P2P network, so if you receive an email from someone it's probably phishing.
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:40:12


Nodes *only* distribute unconfirmed transactions. Once a transaction is confirmed, the *block* (containing the tx) is distributed, not the tx itself. And the only way for an unconfirmed tx to end up in a block is, well, if it gets distributed first and ends up with the miner who happens to include it in the next block.
But it's true that not all unconfirmed txs get distributed:


How do you mean? Note that nodes don't just relay *any* tx, they do check whether all the inputs that are spent by the tx are actually still unspent (and whether the tx is valid at all). 
Most nodes also have certain criteria to filter out dust. By default, nodes won't relay txs if the fee is below a certain priority threshold. A tx's priority depends on its fees, output amounts, and age of the inputs it spends. These filters result in making it impossible (or extremely expensive) to send unlimited spam.

Can't repeat this enough. I'm saying this countless times to anyone involved with Bitcoin: BACK THE F*CK UP. 
The cool thing with Bitcoin: with most modern wallets,
* you need to make a backup only once (HD wallets can be fully restored from a one-time backup seed)
* you ~~can~~ should make a backup even **before** receiving your first coins, so there is exactly 0% risk involved
By the way, **BACKUP NOW**

Nonsense. If we want Bitcoin to flourish, it needs to be able to process more txs, and txs need to remain cheap, period.


Wrong, if everybody is sitting on their coins and nobody is using it, the value will go *nowhere*. What will increase the BTC price is **using** it, i.e. spending (and rebuying to maintain your stack of coins and keep the demand on the market at the same time). 
Security does not take a hit if some miners quit. If mining becomes too expensive, some will stop. If mining becomes profitable, new ones will start. This is a dynamic equilibrium that will regulate itself automatically. By definition, there will always be *enough* miners.
Still, if you're worried about miners not earning enough: smaller or larger blocks will not make a difference. Whether they can process a small number of expensive txs, or a large number of cheap txs, all the same. Except the latter is better for Bitcoin in general. Keeping blocksize fixed at 1MB is shortsighted, not future proof in any way, and will take Bitcoin nowhere.


As a euro user, I don't have dollars, so it doesn't suffice for me to pay for a coffee. There is no worldwide accepted form of fiat, and Bitcoin would be a perfect alternative. 
Besides, the main issue is not being able to buy a cup of coffee. The point is having an alternative independent bank-free money system that **actually works**. And nothing demonstrates this better (and thus helps mainstream adoption) than buying actual things with it.
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:49:37
It exposes way to many technicalities to the enduser. This is great and highly desirable for more advanced users (I personally love Electrum for it) but unsuitable for newcomers. 
Terms like "generation seed" (instead of just calling it "backup"), or having to choose a Wallet Type with options like Multisignature, Two-Factor, Hardware... Lots of people are already lost there. Any usage of terms or concepts they're not familiar with, will make them less comfortable using it, especially when money is involved.
Again keep in mind, this is a huge distinction between advanced, technical, experienced users versus regular non-tech-savy newcomers.
@_date: 2016-02-07 13:56:26

What's the problem? Difficulty is never too low or too high.
If difficulty keeps going higher, it will be less profitable and x percent of miners will stop eventually. Thus difficulty will go down. Thus it will become more profitable. Thus y percent of new miners will come. Thus difficulty will go up -- ad infinitum.
So again, exactly what's the problem?
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:57:16
What you describe was already possible with Paypal. It's the independency, the decentralized nature, the lack of a central party or facilitating company that is the true innovative novelty and advancement of Bitcoin.
The thing is, with Bitcoin, there is no "service" required anymore to do send money around. It combines the advantages of cash with digital money.
Exactly what is the added value of Coinbase, giving them control of your funds, over having your own wallet? Sure, Coinbase works well (as long as they don't ban you for spending *your* money on things *they* don't approve). But if you try Mycelium for Android, or breadwallet for iOS, you'll see it works at least as good. It's easy, user friendly, fast, zero maintenance, **independent**, and 100% safe.
Nothing against Coinbase but I just don't see why anyone would ever prefer their wallet over your own.

I don't know, I'm not into mining, but I guess it would be the same stuff that all these thousands of individuals that are united in mining pools are using.

@_date: 2016-02-14 16:46:13


If the blocksize would be increased, they wouldn't have to choose and they can include *all* transactions. Thus earning even more, which is better for miners. And transactions get confirmed faster, which is better for Bitcoin. Everybody wins!

It's a zero sum game, mining is supposed (or actually, statistically speaking, *expected*) to be neutral for the average user. Since not everybody pays the same for electricity, this means it's profitable for some, and unprofitable for others, evening out to break even for an average random person.

It's like holding me accountable for paying cash to buy vegetables on a market, when the market salesman spends it on coffee, and then the barrista spend it on alpaca socks, and the socks salesman buys drugs with what once was my cash.

Often people mix up transaction time with confirmation time.
Transaction time = the time it takes for the money to arrive at the other party, so they can spend it. 
Confirmation time = the time it takes to become 100% sure the transaction won't be annulled. 
Bitcoin transaction time is 1 second, confirmation time is ten (or sometimes several tens of) minutes.
Paypal transaction time is 5-10 seconds, confirmation time is 3-6 months.
I say it's fast enough.
Coinbase to Coinbase payments being instant (also for confirmation time) has little to do with Bitcoin and more with using a 3rd party intermediary. 
In fact I believe when you do a Coinbase to Coinbase payment, there isn't even a real Bitcoin transaction involved. You could check this by transferring a unique amount of bitcoins (like 0.19283704 BTC or whatever) and see if a transaction for that amount actually shows up in the blockchain. You're doing a virtual transaction within some company's self-managed closed source proprietary database, not in Bitcoin's blockchain.
