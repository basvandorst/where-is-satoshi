Sorry - Fucked that up, use the updated script above, added the flag to not resubmit again

For those that don't want to sit there and hit the submit button right at the dot on viaBTC, I wrote a simple script to submit the form on the hour.  Just enter this into the console after you have entered your transaction ID and captcha code and it will automatically submit close to the new hour:
        var sentFlag = 0;
        
        setInterval(function() {
            var currentTime = new Date().getMinutes();
        
            if(currentTime &gt; 0){
                console.log("don't submit");
            } else {
                if(sentFlag === 1){
                	console.log("already submitted");
                	return;
                }else{
                	$('.mod_transactionInfo form').submit();
                	sentFlag = 1;
                	console.log("submitted");
                }
            }
        }, 100);       
100 means it runs every tenth of a second (1000 is every second).  You can have it run more frequently if you want.

You still need to enter the the transaction and captcha first without hitting submit, run that script in the console, then it will automatically submit the page for you when it gets to the next hour.  It's not groundbreaking or anything, but now you don't need to sit and wait till the new hour to hit submit

Same here, I'm about to test out switching 100 to 1, submissions are coming in really fast

I agree, they only accept 100 free submissions in total per hour.  So the chances of hitting it are pretty slim
