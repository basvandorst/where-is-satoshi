If you think your people just woke up one day and decided to "revolt" in a Communist-Imperalist nation WITHOUT foreign meddling, you are gravely mistaken my friend.
Have fun supporting CIA funded protests lol

What is happening in the media is true we can both agree on that.

Tfw you realize that this is ALL JUST NOISE people! These civil unrest in HK is all orchestrated by Western powers (USA particularly); they have done this before!
This world has and always will be a struggle between EAST and WEST dominance. The HK protests are just that -- it is a distinct fight between competing ideas: Democracy (west) vs. Communism (east). These protests are bigger than any of us; it is part of a war that has been going on since history began -- a mere continuation of a war that hasn't really ended.. the Cold War (Communism vs. Democracy).
This is especially prevalent in the Middle East, which has basically become a "war playground" for Nations such as USA, UK, China, Russia, etc.. Who hedge their assets against each other in the form of Rebel movements, terrorist organizations, government destabilization (taking down communist gov'ts in Syria, Iraq, etc.) Why do they do this instead of direct intervention? Well I believe it is because they know if they directly went to war with each other, they will surely destroy each other given how powerful nations have become today with technological advances. So they resort to third party intervention because these countries' have become so powerful
that if they do not fuel their war machine, they will implode. This is because in order to be a super power, your main industry must be War -- take that away and you take away much of their economy. 
Thank you for listening to my TED talk.
