Yeah. After contacting Mycelium support about it the transaction eventually went through. Thought I deleted $10k for a little while thanks to the FUDers in here.

No, I sent a bch transaction that was to be converted to a BTC amount and deposited back into my main account.

I think I know what I did wrong, maybe you did the same. After you selected which currency to exchange, did you select which account to send BTC back to or did you notice that your account was right there and assume it was good to go since that was your only account?
I made that assumption but I noticed after that if I tap on my account it aligns to the middle with the currency as if it wasn't selected initially but now it is...
I think if I had selected my account like that it would have gone through no problem but IDK for sure. It seems to me that Mycelium should have already is that no receiving account had been selected and not allowed the transaction to proceed...
In any case, submit a trouble ticket with Mycelium with the transaction ID or hash and let them know what's going on. After I did that the transaction came through. Whether it was slow or they did something to make it go through idk for sure either. After about 6 hours of worrying, I finally got my BTC.

Dang, I missed it. These giveaways are part of what made our community so great in the beginning. Keep it up guy/gals!

So I pulled the data from 7/18/2010 to yesterday and did some [excel magic]( A log scale is not appropriate for this comparison because it only spans a few years. You do not HAVE to use a log scale.
So if you look at my graph, we are just starting to dip below the historical projected value. Which means, if the Jean-Paul Rodrigue's idealized graph holds true, we should be nearing the ultimate despair low. However, I do not believe the ultimate low will drop below the arithmetic mean of 152.4979, or on a 99% confidence interval 135.9467-169.0490. We should see some evening out before that, but of course it may drop this low.
The point is this: buy more bitcoin right now. If you bought at the high and are mad that you are losing money, now is the time to recoup your initial investment. Dollar cost average this trough by buying small amounts daily or weekly. Even if you buy as it continues to drop you will be okay because as it steadies out and begins to rise your losses will average out with your gains. As it continues to rise your losses will be drowned out by profits and you may be kicking yourself that you didn't buy more.

Ha! I know right? I just have some old computers sitting around that I would like to bring new life to.

Thanks, I figured it would be low. Is your earning estimate in a pool or stand alone? I mostly just want to figure out some of the nuances so I can build a rig in the near future.

I live in one of the largest zero net energy housing complexes in America, but I don't own it. So I get free electricity and the owners sell the excess back to the grid. However, I do get a requisite amount of electricity each month and so long as i don't surpass it, I have no electricity bill.
I was mostly posting this thread to familiarize myself with setting up a rig ie learning the proper flags for the various systems out there and what works for what.
I did get it working though! Its only like 30MH/s but it's something. I'm currently looking into grabbing up old PC parts from CL to see what I can put together.

Full solar. No electric bill.

For that ancient reference, you sir got my upvote!

Que means what in Spanish. Queue is what the Brits do.

Calc's correct, but it will take 3.9M years to try all possible permutations and not necessarily to solve it.

good luck remembering that shit...
