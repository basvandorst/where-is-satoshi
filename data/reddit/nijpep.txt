So they open a bitcoin pizza joint but aren’t selling 2 pizza’s for 10.000 bitcoin? 
Missed opportunity.

I’m so happy many friends joined the ride with me early on! They all applaud the highs, and we collectively grieve the dips. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:31:52
Clever. They need to create a Coinbase account first before you actually give them the money. Might end up to be a cheap Christmas for you :)
Edit: I just read they all created the account. That’s even better, I guess

What an insanely selfless thing to do! Beautiful!
At this moment I’m in Bangladesh volunteering at the Rohingya refugee crisis. I’m working with a small NGO called [Planting Peace](plantingpeace.org). They have orphanages in Haiti, India and Africa, they erected the Equality House, right across from the Westboro Baptist Church to stand up for LGBT rights, they’re setting up an elephant sanctuary in Laos and right now we’ve set up a free medical clinic where we’re giving medical treatment to hundreds of patients and starving babies here in Bangladesh. Especially for the last cause, Planting Peace can really use (your) money and treat people that truly need it right now! 
I also see a lot of other great projects and causes in the comments. I’m glad to know the money will find a good destination whatsoever.

Absolutely love it, Both the concept behind it and the execution. The grid of dots may seem unrecognisable for some, but there are many  visual identities that work perfectly, even though they don’t seem clear at first.

Aaaaaaand it's gone. But I'm riding this damn coaster for 3 years now, dips like this don't effect my stomach anymore.
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:58:02
Who knows. In 6 months he might very well think that it was an excellent time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 08:31:45
Don't worry. I've got only about 10% in. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:42:59
I concur. Drinking has a causal effect on bitcoin trading. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:05:37
Always wait for the dip. Doesn't matter how long it'll take, the dip will come.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:08:21
And he'll go up again. Just hold (HODL) &amp; don't panic sell. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:18:35
I see the similarities. No one knows what will happen next after they either took LSD or sunk all of their savings into BTC. But you're hoping on getting high. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:54:13
Some sort of YouTube live, but most of it is pre-recorded, and if you missed the live broadcast, you can never see it again unless they 'live' stream it again. Also super super awesome when you were a kid in the 90's. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:55:29
I know, too. Didn't work at RTL. 
Also, which RTL are you referring to? The German one? Dutch one? Are there more?

Once in a while after it plunges I buy one BTC and promise myself to sell that one when it reaches x, just to up my overall ROI. (Bought my first batch at ~200)

Hey fellow Dutchies, i have a Blendle* notification on the word ‘bitcoin’ and every morning I get an email with all the articles containing bitcoin and it’s my morning bitcoin thermometer. The funny thing is: traditional media are always 2 days behind on the fact. Whenever an ATH or dip happens, 2 days later there are 10+ articles, where there are usually 0-3. 
*Blendle is a newspaper service where you can pay for newspaper articles by the article. Usually 10-25 cents per article. It contains every single Dutch newspaper, and a shitton of magazines, and expanded to Germany and the US this year, adding NYT &amp; Washington Post among others.

Cut it in half, keep one offsite (with a relative maybe) and remember the locations.

Slightly unrelated, but this post reminded me of something that happened tonight, in a small theatre in Amsterdam. 
After the show, I walked down the stairs from my balcony seats when a girl (twenty something), walking in front of me, pulled out her phone. She went straight to her finance folder, opening the Coindesk app to check what the Bitcoin did in the past 2 hours. 
Her ~0.4 BTC showed, it was worth ~€320, she closed the app and put her phone away. 
It was the first time I saw someone doing what I do every couple of hours (except that I don't use Coinbase): checking Bitcoin value. And the first time to see a stranger owning Bitcoin and I suddenly had so much more hope for the already bright future.

Awesome socks! Mad expensive though (I'm a H&amp;M sock kinda person), but quite affordable with the 50% off! Don't you have packages with 4 or 5 pairs? Couldn't find 'em.

I can’t believe this got approved with the mountains of bureaucracy in both The Netherlands and Schiphol. This probably had to go through many layers of managers, security, safety, it-guys, safety again and facility. They have protocols for everything there!
@_date: 2016-12-22 10:00:21
If the price drops $100, I buy more!

Bitcoin may very well thrive, but most of us **will** be dead in 2090
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:08:59
That’s a good deal!
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:13:27
As it already happened 50 times in the last 4 years. And while we’re at it: how many times has bitcoin been declared dead by now?
