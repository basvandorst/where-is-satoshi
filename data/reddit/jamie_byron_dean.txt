I'm familiar with the meme; the idea of saying bitcoin "doesn't give a shit about anything" is what I don't like, it just isn't a substantive characterization; it's meaningless. 
The idea of being "agile and resilient," however, is fine I guess.

People, that's who... I know how the blockchain works. I don't know how decentralization correlates to "honey badger." It's just an unproductive simile, that's all I'm saying. And extending the metaphor to Prometheus... Well, if it helps *you* understand the technology better, I guess that's good enough. For me, it just obfuscates what doesn't need to be obfuscatory.

WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU REPOSTING IT HERE???
Edit: I mean it just doesn't make any sense. If you're offended and think it's wrong that the posted it, well good, they removed it, so you're okay. They did the best they can do, short of going backwards in time.
So, in a sign of your anger that they would show this picture in the first place, you make DAMN FUCKING SURE all of us can access the picture?
Your whole "this is the internet" thing doesn't mean anything here. The "bad guys" on the internet are the ones who make this picture visible against others' wishes. So while pointing out that it's still accessible is one thing, PROVIDING ACCESS TO IT is just completely fucking unnecessary. 
I don't understand the process that took you from "hmm, look, they tried to remove it, but it's still there, no one should see it," to "Hey look guise, everyone look, you can still see the pictures you shouldn't be seeing!"

This is the stuff I just don't get about the bitcoin community. Why would you be so gung-ho to force one currency on a merchant over another? It's not like you're wiring money to Germany to get cell phone service. Just write a check or something.

Tulips are fucking tulips, and bitcoins are fucking *strings of code.* One of those has inherent value, and the other is a complicated line of information. 
We're all on the same side here, but come on. Tulips being "fucking tulips" is no argument against tulips or for bitcoins. Bitcoins are *nothing* - they are numbers! Pulled out of thin air! They have utility because we give them utility, value because we value them - which is exactly what tulips had (and still have, to a much more reasonable degree). 
The fact that you think bitcoin are somehow inherently "useful" and tulips "not useful" boggles *my* mind. "They're fucking chains of code" is much more of an argument against bitcoin than "they're fucking tulips" is against tulips.

@_date: 2013-04-07 18:59:22
Will people stop saying that...?
Tulips are physical things which were traded for their value. Take away the speculative value, you still have a flower, which is intrinsically worth something.
Bitcoins are non-physical things which are traded for their value. Take away the speculative value, and you have nothing. You have absolutely nothing, intrinsically worth nothing.
At least when tulips popped you had a garden. 
I'm not saying they're analogous, or one is better than the other, but saying "tulips have no uses, bitcoins have uses" is so absurd its painful. Bitcoins have as much use as tulips ever did - an agreed-upon use. Take away that agreement, and there's nothing - at least with tulips, there are flowers left over, and not lines of code.

As for me, I don't have a good opinion either, except that there was a suspiciously high occurrence of the term "paradigm" as BTC broke $1,000. If this chart *does* prove to be fairly accurate going forward, it will be pretty interesting. But charts don't predict the future, so whose to say.

@_date: 2013-12-06 18:16:09
I can't believe the backflips y'all are going through to justify this stuff.
For years, the argument was that bitcoin was a *currency,* not a *commodity,* which justified basically everything about it. Now, suddenly, we're all about how it's a *commodity,* and not a *currency,* and that's all great and awesome?
Which is it? It's obvious that no one understand bitcoin if we can't even agree on what it is. Is it a currency? A commodity? A bizarre commodo-currency? Neither?
More and more I see people arguing that it's a commodity, like that fixes everything - but doesn't that undermine most of the argument in the first place?
Edit: the answers here vary from "it's all opinion" to "it's everything," but the general sentiment seems to be that bitcoin is "all of the above." Currency, commodity, payment system, ledger.
My lizard brain is having trouble with this idea. Does it really make sense to be all of the above? Payment system and ledger I can understand - but the dual nature of commodity/currency seems to violate something about the nature of identity. This may entirely be my own failing - but as it stands, I am not convinced that it is truly coherent to simply characterize bitcoin as "everything."
Especially since clearly it isn't "everything" - according to the governments, at least, who have taken the strictest efforts so far to characterize bitcoin in clear, legal terms. And these efforts differ in kind and scope. China, for example, seems to have declared it a commodity of sorts, decidedly *not* a currency. But didn't Germany take an opposite stance? (Unclear there - don't hold me to it)
Edit: It's my cakeday! Yay! Two years of wasted time!

@_date: 2013-12-10 02:38:08
You make some good points in my opinion, and the exchange that follows is good. Generally I think I side with you but all the points raised are pretty valid across both parties.


This is the amazing thing to me. What if I were to say, "I have these things called dollars, but everytime you use one, you have to donate a penny or two, you know, to make sure the "decentralized authority" authenticates it."
I mean, that's a nasty simplification, but the idea is that an in-built transaction fee on every single transaction is, while not inconceivable, certainly *not* a good and reasonable thing. 
Another side of this issue is that bitcoin sustainability philosophy seems to suggest that transaction fees are integral to the long-term survivability of the network, and those fees will have to increase to make miners' lives worthwhile. I may be wrong here - I don't really understand the idea completely, to be honest. But if I have the gist right, then transaction fees are only become more necessary, and more expensive, over time.
Here's why this stuff is bothering me so much. Bitcoin has been sold - both popularly and personally, and all over this subreddit since the dawn of time - as a few things: instant, free, and anonymous. 
Smart people don't say those things anymore - they say near-instant, low-cost, and pseudononymous. But... come on. Compared to a cash transaction, bitcoin is not near-instant - it takes eons. Compared to an international wire, bitcoin is considerably quicker, but still not "instant" - unless you're willing to pay a large fee, of course! And so on and so on with pseudononymity, etc... 
And on top of all that, this "be your own bank thing." It's just a lot of phrases and idioms that are misleading, meme-ish marketing that don't represent reality, and in many ways don't represent clear advantages.
In that respect, while I'm on the topic, perhaps the central confusion is in what aspect of the protocol we are talking about. The part that people identify as a currency, the part of that that people identify as international wires, the part that is supposed to replace local cash transactions, the part that identifies as a commodity, the part that identifies as an "open-source start-up" ("like getting in on email," wtf?), etc... all these parts are being spoken of in unison, and perhaps that's the root of some of these miscommunications.

Well... you and literally every single person with access to the blockchain who might have any interest. So, banks, governments, friends, enemies, and yes, you.


Absolutely true. Global money transfer is the most "bank-like" aspect of bitcoin. I accept that.
Beyond that, though, that simply isn't what a "bank" is. According to some of the simpler definitions I could find, it fills three roles; safe storage, money transport, and loans.
I would say that the third one - loans - is the most important, followed by safe storage. Of course, there are ways to store bitcoins safely, but you can do the same thing with gold and cash - that doesn't make you a banker. Similarly, you could loan someone bitcoin, like you could hand someone cash, but again, not banking.
So if you decide to re-define "bank" into the idea of "send money easily anywhere in the world," you are being deliberately misleading on the nature of "banking." That's my problem with it, and what I'm trying to address.
Those are my feelings about it. I completely agree about the amazing utility of fluid international money transfers.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:37:58
Also - what's the real problem here?
Someone stole from him, the anti-theft process went into effect, she'll have a new debit card in two days (and like, a checkbook in the meantime, maybe?), her money *will be returned to her.*
These are all the point of trusting our money with a bank. So if someone steals it, we can get it back through a fair process of due diligence for both parties. 
If the bank *was* in the process of flagging every single purchase at $60 for fraud, I bet there would be a lot more "My bank sucks, big brother, it's not your business" posts. But when it doesn't flag soon enough, it's still their fault? 
It's super cool that the OP was able to send his wife the money she needed quickly. That's the best part of bitcoin, in my opinion.
But even then.. what's she going to do with it now? Sign up for an exchange and wait two months to cash out by sending money to her checking account? Shop on bitpay/gyft for a few days? 
E: Oh right, she went to a "dealer" and sold the coins for cash. At that point, just send her to a Western Union, you know? Whatever... As long as OP's family got what was needed, that's the important thing, I guess.

But I drew a dissimilar conclusion from the same facts. Given that gold and silver are the only elements that satisfy the requirements/expectations for a valuable - but not too valuable - storage and transference of wealth, why do you suddenly reject it?
If you were going to pick a substance to replace gold, what would it be? What element would be better? And if not an element, what? 
I'm not too good at economics etc, so I'm not trying to assert anything here or call you wrong. It was refreshing to see actual thought put into a comment here for once, but I was just a little surprised because I drew an opposite conclusion from the same facts.
Based on the unique properties gold/silver have that separate them from all other elements and contribute to usage as money, doesn't that constitute "intrinsic value?" At least, just as much "intrinsic value" as something like a hash has?
Edit: It's like poetic meter. There is an argument (perhaps outdated, flawed) that iambic pentameter is the "standard" not arbitrarily, but because it is simply the natural rhythm we (roughly) speak in. So shorter meters like trimeter are a deviation that intrinsically (with relation to pentamenter) comes off as fast or energetic, while longer meters are a mouthful. Typing all this out, this analogy didn't go as far as I hoped, but I'm going to leave it in the off chance it sheds any sort of light whatsoever on what I'm trying to talk about.

I feel like everyone here gifting bitcoins for Christmas is doing it for themselves, not for the gift recipients. It's just not a good gift. It's an imposition. At the very best it's just money; and money is just an uninspired gift (although some people may want money, so whatever).

@_date: 2013-12-06 23:10:24


Is this true? I honestly don't have the economic background to know if that's accurate or not.
Using a dictionary definition is almost always a terrible simplification and usually irrelevant, but in this case a commodity is defined as "a raw material or agricultural product that can be bought and sold." Meanwhile a currency is "a system of money in general use in a particular country." I'm not sure where you got your definition from?
Neither a dollar nor an algorithm are "raw materials" or "agricultural products." They are representations of a value that can be used to *trade* raw materials and agricultural products. 
Do you have an argument for why a dollar is just a "commodity"? 
I guess if I'm going to rely on a common dictionary definition, I should include the second one for currency: "the fact or quality of being generally accepted or in use."
I guess that would qualify both gold and, in theory, bitcoin as a "currency." 
But I also am extremely suspicious that these basic definitions truly represent the economic meaning of the terms "commodity" and "currency." If a trained economist could weigh in on that, I'd be very interested. Perhaps the simple definition is a correct one.

Yes it makes sense, and I disagree. It isn't the word that's important but what it represents, and right now that seems to be an entirely intangible object.
No one in the world should own and use bitcoins unless they understand them (in my opinion), but how many of us really understand them - if we don't even know what they call them, or what properties they have/should have, etc?
E: So I completely understand your point but I don't find it personally satisfactory. You can make up a new word if you want, or language box, or whatever, but I'm interested in the facts and premises it would correspond to, which words like "currency" and "commodity" already have known connections to.

Also, I mean, fees are simply part of it. If I understand correctly, the whole idea is that the network is supported long-term by the incentivisation of transaction fees. I know we can get away with minimal transaction fees now, but it's a little like cash - but worse. With cash, I hand you some and there will be no transaction fee. With bitcoin, that would be some nominal fee, no matter what, and I'd have to wait an hour to make sure it went through.
With both cash and bitcoin, you can send "money" through a service - like an exchange or escrow or whatever - and pay fees that way. Like the fees you pay to buy/sell bitcoins (the same kind of fees you deal with with wire transfers).
It's a tricky issue, but as I understand it, transaction fees are integral to the success of the network. So it's actually fundamentally "cost," not "almost no cost."

I agree, I think that's the bulk of zeusa1mighty's comment. The problems he posed are less problems for a commodity like gold than they are for a currency.
And I wonder if, strictly speaking, gold *is* harder to store? The steps for cold storage are no small feat, especially with large amounts. A single gold coin represents over $1,200 and can be hidden virtually anywhere, even on your persons. Vaults are required for larger quantities, yes, but when you consider all the offline computers and paper wallets in safes and buried and all that... it doesn't start to look much easier. 
I could be way off base here though.

I mean, yes, but a relatively minute quantity in total. There's a reason the gold market has such a large capitalization.
For many people, the very idea of preferring a set of data to a piece of beautiful metal is, honestly, pretty absurd. Even cash can at least be burned for warmth in the wintertime. From this perspective - Old World, perhaps - it is honestly *very* difficult to even conceive of choosing a bitcoin over an ounce of a precious metal.

Lol holy shit you have no idea how markets work. And anyway the rest of your claims are just as baseless as anything you're arguing against.


These aren't "weasel words," these are a serious concern. If someone hacks into my Schwab account and steals my money, it's protected and insured. If someone hacks into my Russian-based currency exchanger, or my Polish-based Euro/BTC exchange, or my Japanese-based wallet, that money is gone. Even if I don't get hacked, the operators could simply shut down and walk away with everything. There is a HUGE element of trust at play here - gentlemen's agreements across the board - and that is simply unacceptable to a lot of people. 


Holy titty-fucking Christ, this is wrong. It doesn't take 10% of the market moving to drop the price 10%. You could sell ONE bitcoin today at $10 and the price would drop to $10 - whether or not it stayed there is up to the other sellers and buyers in the market, and it probably wouldn't. But selling 1 million coins at once would *destroy* the market. It wouldn't inherently limit the losses to 10% just because it's 10% of the market - the fact that you think that's the case because of "source: grade school math" is painfully ignorant. 


I'm not sure either, but I assume it has to do with the huge potential for market manipulation with such a thinly-traded asset as bitcoin. Someone with the right resources and a certain mindset could wreak wild havoc given the scale of the bitcoin economy. 


And the opinion of yourself is patently obvious as well, and even moreso. I have no problem with you being mega-pro-bitcoin, most of the people on this forum are, and I believe the pros outweigh the cons as well. But BTC is a market, and the market is what makes it worth $140 instead of $0, and simply saying "Even if there was, the act of selling them would only drop the price by 10%, not a spiral to zero. source: grade school math" shows how *completely* ignorant of basic market dynamics you are.
And that sort of mentality is worrying.

This sort of hand-wavey abstraction doesn't really help the matter, either. At best you're putting together a messy monetary theory, at worst you're obfuscating the topic. 
For example: a commodity designed to act as money? What exactly does that mean? Is that a coherent characterization, technically speaking, or is that literally nonsense? Like saying, "It's a knife designed to act as a fork." What exactly is that saying about the utensil you are trying to characterize? Furthermore, how is something like gold any different? Other than the fact that it wasn't "designed" in any certain way - does the fact that you *can* exchange gold like a currency mean it's a "commodity designed to act as money?"

Yeah but that's total apples to oranges. 
A deposit fee is a deposit fee. Every time an Indian buys a loaf of bread they aren't paying a deposit fee. Every time an Indian gives their kid some money they aren't paying fees. 
With transaction fees, it's completely different. You're not just paying to "deposit" - you're paying to do literally anything. Everytime you pay with bitcoin you have to pay a fee. 
It doesn't matter of that fee represents one rupee or fifty - when the average salary is as low as it is, that's a *significant* portion of wealth that no one can afford to waste. 
How you would ever compare deposit fees in a bank to transaction fees on a purchase is beyond me.

Sure, just dismiss the threat. That's a good way to deal with reality.

Sure, maybe there are different agendas occurring the different mainstream news outlets. But this subreddit is like the spin doctor of how the evil media is attacking bitcoins - it's like zerohedge or infowars sometimes. 
Maybe I'm dead wrong and this is all active and sinister attacks, I don't know. But it gets tiring to see people blame the media week after week literally no matter what they do, whether they promote bitcoin or attack it or ignore it.

If you tip me 1 bitcoin, I promise I will give $1,000 to a homeless guy tomorrow. I'm still trying to figure out how this works, and I think that would be very helpful.

Although it didn't seem to verify... Thanks anyway though! I don't have any bitcoin but I'm thinking about buying some soon, hopefully the price doesn't keep skyrocketing.

That doesn't really help the situation. It isn't an opinion whether a dollar is a unit it currency or not. Or whether gold is a currency. 
The actual nature of bitcoin is up to opinion, then?

True - I shouldn't have characterized it so much as one or the other. It has been a debate for a while. 
For some reason I had thought the "currency" side had gained dominance.

I agree with your sentiment and the big-picture view, for sure.

Are you trying to spin this positively or what?
@_date: 2013-12-21 07:55:54
So they don't accept bitcoins. 
This gyft thing is so obnoxious. 
Look, if you give me bitcoins, I'll go shopping at the grocery store for you and mail you the groceries. That doesn't mean the grocery accepts bitcoins. That means some middleman accepts bitcoins. 
It's just flat out misinformation to spin gyft as "acceptance." Bitpay as well, but maybe that's a little more legitimate a characterization. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:33:24
Just on one point, how has the fundamental market not changed? When China was "on board," it was supposed to revolutionize it. Now that they've pumped the brakes, they don't matter anymore?
The scope is arguable, but I have a hard time accepting the idea that the market hasn't changed.

In some regards, you're absolutely right - "It lets me transfer my wealth directly to another person, without relying a bank or payment processor to do it for me." That's true, and I recognize that superior utility - as long as we are talking globally.
But your opening statement, "What does a bank do? It allows you to transmit money from one bank account to another." Is simply misleading. That's not what banks do - at least, not everything.
From the FDIC, an interesting bit:


So that essentially offers three points: safe storage, movement of money, and loans.
You've got "movement of money" pretty well, I agree.
But safe storage and loans? Those have nothing to do with bitcoin. I can bury a treasure chest in my backyard, I can bury an offline wallet somewhere. No difference - one doesn't make me a bank over the other. And as far as loans go - which is arguably the most important function of the banking institution - there really isn't anything there, either.
I appreciate the sentiment. Again, instant movement of money is hands down an advantage that, globally speaking, replaces both cash and banks. But even that is indistinguishable from cash on a local level - you don't need a bank to give a cashier a dollar for a pack of gum, you know?
And for savings and loans, I don't think you have a case.
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:07:17
Sorry, I didn't mean to make you sound "sinister." You're not as bad as some other businesses - one company literally just started complaining and blaming this sub one day. I'd link to it if I weren't on my phone in a hospital bed. So I'm reacting to that as much as this. 
The idea of a reliable review system is good but what's to keep anyone from gaming it?

This is just my two cents, but I think the best way to gift bitcoin is not do it. It's the theoretical equivalent of handing some cash, isn't it? Except it's cash that carries a burden of adoption and learning and speculative swings in value, etc. 
I mean any gift is a good gift, but this is just giving someone cash or a gift card, with added layers of inconvenience and an aura of pushiness - pushing what amounts to a penny stock on someone who otherwise is not informed nor interested. 
Try buying something unique with bitcoins instead! Or making them something - everyone loves that kind of thoughtfulness.

Literally that entire comment applied to bitcoin - except for the 95% mined I guess.

I don't understand your first point - how would a price decrease not affect the value of your coins? But more importantly, regarding your second point - it isn't just large speculators, it's a lot of people - like my parent's generation. 
I mean consider the Cypriots. Large depositors woke up one morning and realized that their uninsured deposits were about to disappear, and even the insured ones weren't safe for a moment. That sort of thing can lead to mass panics and bank runs - the underlying insurance of the institution is compromised. Now with Bitcoin, there's no insurance at any level, period - so it isn't just large depositors, it's small depositors at every level who have to live knowing that, in a lot of ways, their currency could vanish at any second, especially if they deal with external companies - which you basically have to at this point, whether its an exchange, a wallet, or whatever else. All these little exchanges and wallets could basically disappear with everyone's money and take off, and no one would be there - ie, the Fed - to reimburse us.
You or I may be willing to take that risk, and even some large speculators (contrary to general risk-averseness) might be willing to take that risk, but many normal people who would potentially use bitcoin as a store of value, investment, or currency (which is the real idea), are turned away by that inherent risk. Lack of guarantees is not something that appeals to someone who has worked hard their entire life and simply wants to retire and sleep well at night. 
I understand not wanting Wall Street in your bitcoin (which is probably not true anyway at this point), but what about the rest of the world? The people who this currency would rely on if it is to become mainstream and stable? I mean who would you rather deposit your dollars/euro/fiat currency with - the bank that is federally insured up to $100,000, or the bank that has zero insurance but promises a high interest rate? Some people might go with the latter - and that's what a lot of Cypriots did - but many more people would go with the former, and those are the type of people that a currency needs to have long-term viability.

What in blue blazes is the virtual securities floor about? That doesn't make any sense whatsoever to me. AAPL might as well issue shares on gold nuggets. That doesn't mean AAPL shares would be protected by anything. 
It would just add a premium to the share cost, like a deposit. It's totally arbitrary. If the company collapsed, you'd still lose your entire investment.

Right, but, what does that have to do with bitcoin? How can I "be my own bank?"


That's more to the point. Even then, however, I think it's a little complicated. In pure theory, the same can be said of dollars as bitcoins in this respect. If you don't want to deal with a bank, just don't. Mail a hundred dollar bill to the wikileaks headquarters or whatever.
But the utility of paying cash on an international level is definitely far below the utility of sending a bitcoin, so in that sense I understand. But then that doesn't have anything to do with banks, does it? 
On a local level, there's no difference. If you can go to the grocery store and buy something with bitcoins - bank-free - then you can do the same thing with cash. Just don't put your cash in a bank. 
But not using a bank is not the same thing as being a bank.
