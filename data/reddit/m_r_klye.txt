Grow up. Killing yourself when you have kids is selfish as fuck.
You lost everything? Been there. Man the fuck up and look to fix it instead of taking the easy way out. Come on. It's just money.

Hey Dean. Can you tip to my account on your site? UID 355
@_date: 2014-05-27 07:54:16
The dice can be cruel.. sorry about your loss
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:27:51
As I clearly stated. I am not the one who posted this.
It was a user from Doge-Dice that had heard what my situation was.
@_date: 2014-05-13 15:39:15
What denomination are you guys refering to for a "bit:?
mBTC? Satoshits?
@_date: 2014-01-28 06:32:37
This is FUD.
I was literally just talking to dooglus.. Fucking noob
Also look at this users posts.. It's all speedbet bullshit.
Either the owner of speedbet or some retarded ass FUDster.
Also the FBI has no power in Canada. 
GTFO FAGG

Ahh, Thanks for the clarification guys. So 1 bit = 100 sat.
Gotcha! Also thakns for the tips gents!
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:42:05
Hmm. Where would you like these items sent sir..?
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:18:40
Guy should have gambled on Just-dice.com
The max bet is far superior to PD and he would have walked away a greater winner. As dooglus said.

Hello Mr. Yunzhu Lin.
Permission to contact you through SKYPE?
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:03:27
For the record, I did not post this. Nor is pthnmj an alt of mine.
He is a user from Doge-dice.com (sister site of Just-dice.com) that had heard of my predicament and wanted to help me.
So please before you go off and rip the messengers head off, don't. This man is merely trying to help an addict (me) not freeze to death at the end of the month once rent is due..
Stay safe guys,

Site is down for a bit while I try and figure out why cloudflare broke it.

Although gladiator fight aren't against our terms of service, Killing people on cam is frowned upon on KLYEMAX and would result in the account being terminated and the authorities contacted.
The ideas you've listed there are great! We hope that users get creative given the ability to do so.
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:44:54
We are back to 100% operation after replacing our streaming engine. Go start a stream. :)
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:26:02
The site is back online but we're currently working on the video server, you will be unable to stream until we can complete the maintenance. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 18:17:03
Despite the initial tragedy caused by my previous terrible decision making moving on with the project was the only way to rectify the situation. I'm glad I was able to develop the skills needed to develop this site, and have great plans for the future of KLYEMAX.
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:52:07
You don't lose money in BTC until you spend or sell them.
Killing yourself over money is foolish, Regardless of the amount.
@_date: 2015-08-04 22:41:49
Is this a legit question..?
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:47:26
Last time I checked being a hooker was illegal..
But while we are here.... Suck your dick for a dollar!? :D
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:57:42
I wasn't aware at the time I was even required to register with an SEC or anything like that, In hindsight should have done more research, Oh well. Atleast I'm attempting to correct the matter rather than pulling a Karpeles and running like a little bitch.
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:35:44
Probably not.
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:54:15
Yeah?! Aright I'll start making more products. :)
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:00:09
Hey guys, Just thought I'd let Reddit know I'm doing a fundraiser in order to help pay back the Klyemax Studios investors!
Shirts are priced at $27 USD.
$15 is cost of shirt and shipping.
$10 goes to the Klyemax investors.
$2 goes in my pocket for ramen.
I currently owe about 22 BTC to my investors.
The goal is to sell about 600 shirts or so, and have Klyemax Studios investors put at ease!
Escrow accepted!
New designs in the works!
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:43:06
This basically goes without saying.
Thank you captain obvious! Where would we be without you!?
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:21:21
Dick Tree T-shirts and KLYE ART prints on shirts and coffee mugs are coming shortly uvwvj! Thanks for inquiring!
@_date: 2015-08-05 04:55:55
If coming back here to try and right my wrongs is abusing the community I'd hate to know how'd you feel if I came with ill intent.
I'm not here to fight with anyone, regardless of what it looks like.
I just want to repay my investors and gain some peace of mind.
@_date: 2015-08-04 15:51:04
You're quite opinionated for a non-shareholder.
Hell, I've got a guy I owe a bit less than 18 BTC to that complains less than you do. Infact he doesn't bitch at all.. He simply applauds my attempts in repaying. So basically go fuck your hat NotHyplon. ;)
I pissed away 95% of the money gambling for the record as well.
@_date: 2015-08-05 05:51:22
You are entitled to your beliefs, that's fine. Not here to start a flame war nor have a big cock competition.
I'm here to sell shirts. Not piss your order BTC away or have a Klyemax repeat. 
The bad waves I caused through the Bitcoin ecosystem affected lots of people, not just my investors and myself and I understand the hostility towards me.
All I ask is you find it in you to at least attempt to redeem myself rather than instantly jump on the attack. -_-
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:21:51
I'm from Canada.. Gonna join the page anyways and if I'm ever down your way use the site to find fellow Bitcoiners!
@_date: 2015-03-25 06:30:39
 - Helps the needy and homeless. I myself am homeless at the moment and p[laces like this help tons others!
@_date: 2013-08-22 11:40:21
Thanks Jo! was that you who sent .00425858 BTC my way?!
@_date: 2013-08-22 12:13:54
I heard about bitcoin like 3 years ago to be honest.. A friend had bought some at around $3 a piece and I thought it was stupid back then.. Kinda wish I had followed his lead and did the same!
@_date: 2013-08-22 11:21:16
Thank you sir! I'll have to check these sites out.
This bitcoin thing is really neat!
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:42:57
Likashing is very generous.
 &lt;-- Come play BTC
@_date: 2013-08-22 11:53:49
Thanks man! Greatly appreciated!
@_date: 2013-08-22 11:43:00
Any shares a man should look into? I hear labcoin might be going to the moon!
@_date: 2013-08-22 11:49:31
Oh crap. Sorry to disturb.. :/
@_date: 2013-08-23 17:29:23
Strange Boel.. I have had this happen before though.. Blockchain needs a recode imho.
@_date: 2013-08-22 11:50:26
You'd suggest buying up some if I could afford it then?
@_date: 2013-08-22 11:53:22
Ahh. I will have to thank him. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!
@_date: 2013-08-27 10:21:49
I am honoured to be part of this!
