people are leaving because bitcoin has a technological transaction capacity that scales as computers and internet improves, but instead miners are choosing to retain a temporary blocksize limit that was put in place to prevent laptop hard drives being filled up overnight.

Why would a contractual hash be considered spam?

What do the locals actually use?  No one else was walking around with a barrel full of money.

The blockchain is a record of titles, currency is one application.

Yes bitcoin can be used by anyone for many innovative new services, but bitcoin was born from the cryptoanarchy movement.  A free individual is worth much more than saving 1% on an amazon purchase.
Even if someone does not care about personal freedoms, just by using bitcoin's titling and smart property system that person is voting for a new, automated legal system that makes one aspect of the state irrelevant.  
Ready or not here it comes.

I think you meant to say always take yelp reviews with a grain of salt.

The shirts are backordered though, I recommend the hammocks.
@_date: 2011-08-04 04:20:57
I'll sell you something.
1) Mayan hammock, optional rastafarian colors
2) T-Shirt compatible with IVs

Why doesn't Google drop the US government for, I don't know, starting these murder rampages?
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:11:38
It was mostly jargon.  bitcoin, market manipulation, leveraged, volume.  all jargon.

Thank you!

Some dice are cheaply made.
@_date: 2015-02-15 07:16:15
I did it!  Enjoy.

Thank you!  I am thinking how to do 3 satoshi worth of pushups right now.

Go to brainwallet.org.  Paste the formatted answer into the passphrase field.  That will return a private key.  Copy the private key.  Go to blockchain.info and make a wallet.  There is an import/export feature.  Click on that.  Paste the private key into the field and press 'sweep'
Did that make sense?  Let me know where you get stuck and I'll help you out.

Interesting, yes, there is a good chance for international media coverage if multiple stores of a franchise accepted bitcoin in one town.

It's an honor system. Cash in the box, bitcoin wallet on the mac. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:21:49
Yeah, there might be an arms race.  I'm going to develop puzzles that are not easily solved by computers, that's why the sudokus have only mBTC on them.

The merchant would not pay any fees to receive, and they are optional for faster transactions to send.

I am an advisor of sanitation and ecology for the seasteading institute and also a volunteer ambassador for them. I would be happy to answer any questions. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:29:31
I am not a naval engineer trained in large metal structures so I won't comment on details of damage and repair at sea.  I will say that safety issues such as that are comparable to those of a cruise ship.  Issue an SOS, shoot flares, call nearby vessels, and of course being in the high seas the crew is prepared with life boats.
Maybe [the seasteading institute's engineering reports]( would be interesting for you to read through.  They do great research.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:55:15
Ah ok.  I was guessing with no real background on that.  Cool page.

That is what the space elevator is for.

There are quite a few decent rigs out there at a steep discount.

Bitcoin is what paypal aspired to be. Coincidence?
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:56:39


How long would it take to do that?

The seasteading institute produces high quality research reports for legal and oceanic conditions. The research that they already have out is extremely valuable for entrepreneurs navigating the very ambiguous landscape (seascape) of international law and the very hazardous ocean environment.  The prime directive is to support entrepreneurship, not to lead the construction. That said, they recently ran an indiegogo campaign that funded the design of a modular seastead called deltasync. The full engineering report is out now.

That is optional. I did mention a 1% fee to convert instantly to another currency paid to the POS company. I negligently left that out of my OP. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:49:20
I will include that somehow. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:59:39
Thank you!  This will go into a puzzle.

Installing safe structures on the high seas is expensive. The idea is to get started in protected waters and incrementally build out a seastead, adding modules and then a full breakwater. At that point the seastead could be towed out to sea, best of both worlds. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:34:43
I might add an option to buy into competitions with larger prizes, and of course more puzzles are on their way!
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:37:31
'cruise ship' is a more accurate image of life on a seastead than 'barge'.
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:48:13
Not at all. I've never heard anyone at the seasteadingg institute who wants to issue currency on board. It's all about competing currencies and bitcoin has a lot of utility for remote locations with relatively small populations.

I actually think a rather secure paperwallet would be a few unsolved sudokus in a drawer plus some personal information.  Keep [one of these sudoku books]( at home, and how would anyone know which ones to solve.  Who would even think to look for money in a brand new puzzle book??
