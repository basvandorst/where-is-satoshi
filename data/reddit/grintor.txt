Where do you get the idea that holding something makes it less valuable? The harder something is to obtain, the more it costs. "By weight, the single most valuable thing that's been bought and sold on an open market is probably the Treskilling Yellow postage stamp. There's only one known copy of it, and in 2010 it sold for $2,300,000." The owner still has it and has no plans to sell it. Are you telling me it's worthless now? What of the mona Lisa? I hear she doesn't get sold often these days. Is she worthless too?

It's not only that; for each additional bit in word size, the required number of transistors for the same configuration increases exponentially. That's not sustainable. If a 32 bit processor requires x^32 transistors, an otherwise identical 64 bit version would require x^64 transistors. Which is waaaaay more. See [the paper folding problem](

I know what you are trying to do. I attempted to find a way to do this a while back.  Unfortunately, I think with the current state of things it's impossible to create proof two people signed a contact using the blockchain. The reason being, even if you each sign a contract, the only person who can prove you signed it is yourself.
Imagine we each signed a message with the hash of the document using a wallet we each control. Now imagine I decide to back out of the contact. All I have to do is say I never signed it... You can't prove I did; all you can prove is that it was signed by two private keys. YOU can prove that YOU signed it. And I can prove that I signed it. But YOU cannot prove that I signed it.
The only way to create an enforceable contract is to have a real world identity tied to the signatures. For that identity to be proven requires a 3rd party. In the physical rhelm that's a notary public. In the digital rhelm that's a certificate authority. There is not yet a full proof decentralized alternative. (Though you might want to research "web of trust")

Since the QR code doesn't have a private key, just a kiosk code that the website interprets, you could disallow withdraws for 24 hours on not-well-established accounts. (Perhaps at the kiosk operators discretion?). Alternatively, if two established accounts with balances both try to cash out the code, you could contact both account owners and freeze their assets until the matter is resolved. Just a thought.

In general, the national debt isn't really something that needs to be paid off necessarily. It feels good personally to be debt free, of course. But if you could make twice as much by carrying a reasonable interest loan for a while and profit much in the end then wouldn't you do that?
Here is something very important:
The US doesn't go out and take loans from people or companies or other nations. The US sells debt, bonds and treasuries, at an auction. Entities invest in the US, and the US pays debt holders dividends procured from revenues or the issuance of additional treasuries. The more demand there is for US treasuries, the more people have to pay to buy them, and the lower the interest rate the US government has to pay back on them.
Imagine how crazy it is to be able to get people to give you trillions of dollars and you only have to pay back a few percent interest, but they are willing to do this because your economy and society are the strongest and most stable and you are the safest bet in the world.
*Oh and, if everyone thought that the US was a big risk and no one bought any treasuries then the US would have mostly no debt aside from short term accounts. *
Here is something else very important:
Many investors don't want to be paid in full ahead of schedule. They buy treasuries and bonds, low-risk financial instruments that have regular payments, because those investors need those regular payments to turn around and make regular payments themselves. They get the coupon payments from the bond and use it to cover payroll or property taxes.
So suppose US just dumps a bunch of cash on all the bond holders and says "Debt is finally paid off enjoy." What does this guy do with the money? Well he tries to buy more bonds, because he hasn't lost his need for a safe investment that pays a regular sum to cover his payrolls and property expenses.
So does America sell him more bonds and we go right back into debt? Or does Russia sell him bonds and now our cash is being invested in Russia?

Yea, I see your mistake now. That would only be true if the light intensity of the peak time of day stayed the same all day for 16 hours, which will never happen. ["sunhours"]( is a term we use in solar calculations that tell you the equivalent amount of that "peak sun" you get when you add up all the off-peak throughout the day. So if you say the average for an area is 4.2 sunhours per day, that means you get the equivalent of 4.2 hours of high-noon sun throughout the day. In reality, you only get a few minutes of that high-noon sun, but they are adding together all the morning and evening less-intense sun to give you an easy number to use. It's easy because you can just multiply it by the panel PTC rating to get a real-world kwh output. The Panasonic M330 has a PTC rating of [311.3W](ftp://ftp.panasonic.com/solar/specsheet/n325330-spec-sheet.pdf) So if you get 4.3 sunhours per day and muliply that by 311.3 watts you end up with 1338.59 or 1.34Kwh per panel per day.
now look at a map an check what longitude you are at. If you are in the northern hemisphere you should point your panels south and angle them at that same angle that your longitude is, same for the southern hemisphere, but facing north. That will give you the most total energy output in one year. So for MI, that's facing true south with a 44 degree pitch.
The sun is lower in the sky in the winter and higher in the sky in the summer. At the solstice, it's at it's most extreme: summer solstice is the point at which the sun is highest in the sky, and winter solstice is the point at which it's at it's lowest. Most of the time, the sun is not hitting your panels head-on, and since it's hitting them at an angle, the energy is being spread over a larger area. That's the same reason it's colder in the winder; the sun's energy it less intense because it's not directly overhead. But if you have your angle set at 44 degrees, then the equinox is when the rays hit the panels head-on. The equinox is when the sun is [right in the middle]( of it's lowest and highest point in the sky. (I misspoke earlier when I said the peak production is at the solstice and equinoxes. I meant so say just equinoxes.)
I have the same size system as you, slightly over 10kw peak. I am in central Georgia If you would like to take a look at the output, [here is a link](

You have 26 panels. You said you are in Michigan which means you get less than 5 sunhours per day even on really good days. 180k / 5 / 26 would imply that you have 1,300 watt pannels. That doesn't exist.
In reality, those are polycrystalline panels, the highest wattage of which you can buy is 309 (ptc) watts. At an average of 4 sunhours per day, you are able to get 4* 309 * 26/1000*30=964 kwh per month.
That's not even including the energy loss to the inverters. In reality, you are looking at 50 kwh on "long summer days" maybe. Not sure where you got your 180 figure from.
although the equinox and the solstice is when you should be getting your maximum output, not in the summer. unless the panels are not angled for maximum annual output

@_date: 2015-02-05 02:11:52
I just checked, and as I suspected they a actually copyrighted the name for themselves:
Not only that, they trademarked it for use as pertaining to "managing digital currency payment and exchange transactions"
Looks like it doesn't belong to Bitcoin anymore.
:( 
What does the Bitcoin foundation do again?
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:27:27
It is trademarked to them as pertaining to: "managing digital currency payment and exchange transactions" 
@_date: 2016-07-16 23:19:55
Ah yes, this makes perfect sense since bitcoin is the only currency.
@_date: 2015-02-20 14:43:48
Why not BTC?
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:53:23
Yeah, but the fed can just make more of those. The bitcoins on the other hand are legitimately lost

That's interesting. I don't know how that is... I'm going to try contacting the author.

Look closer, it asks them for a bitcoin address where they can receive before they can sell, that's where it sends refunds.

Sorry if I made mistakes, I didn't look over it very well. Tired. Going to bed. If anyone has questions, I can answer them in about 8 hours. But if anyone feels this really benefited them, or enlightened them, please feel free to tip me, :-D 1KSyoewPS2QZfFDF6A5s6Hn1URj9rUtWze I spent a considerable amount of money on transaction fees and blockchain.info fees to research this topic because I thought it was important for the bitcoin community. If people send a little here and there, it will help me offset what I spent to come up this. Thanks

The deposit code is base-32 encoded string containing the following:
the kiosk ID: tells the website which machine it is.
the deposited amount: tells the website how much money was put in.
transaction ID: increments by one each time, prevent double-spend.
8 alert bits: tells the website if something is wrong (paper jam, out of money, etc...).
digital signature: a sha256hmac signature to prove valid
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:04:47
The note recycler supports over 200 currencies. All that's inside other than the cash recycler is an atmega328p microcontroller, a resistor, and a 5v voltage regulator.
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:38:06
I was thinking instant online verification, like the kind bitinstant uses.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:23:30
That's a good idea, does this mixer exist?
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:13:54
haha, I'll leave that out. But there is an interesting advantage to per-transaction authentication like my machine uses -- user identification just became a whole lot easier (if you want it). If the kiosk operator wants (well, if the law in that area requires) that the operator tracks the identity of the user, then all that has to be done is to establish a user identity via the website before the website lets the user complete a transaction. For example, the website could link to one of those databases of public information (like how bitinstant verification works) -- ask some questions like "we see you owned a car in 2009, what were the payments, we see you bought a house in 2000, what was the mortgage company, blah blah etc..." and wala, user identity establishment and regulatory compliance without all that intrusive retina scanning
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:20:58
Hey, thanks.
The code that's generated uses a sha256-HMAC signature with a shared key. That's the same algorithm used by bitcoin itself. There should be no way short of a brute-force attack to create a working code. Using a captcha on the website should be enough to deter a brute force attack on the website itself, and an attack on the key should be impossible (without a quantum computer?).
Each kiosk has a different shared key. That way, it will only work for the kiosk it was intended. While not implemented yet, a step not included in the video would be "find a kiosk near you" in which they would pick which kiosk they intended to use before a code was generated.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:00:18
I have a bitcoin kiosk that is superior in many ways. (mainly cost) bitcoinkiosk.com
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:34:26
I think maybe too many... I remember when I thought of the idea about five months ago thinking "I bet I could build that in two weekends". But then there was Hofstadter's law.
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:37:09
You don't have to write them down, you could take a pic. They are no longer than a credit card number. (16 digits) Though a QR code would make things easier. I spoke about that above.
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:28:01
Not a bad idea, I'll certainly consider this. On the other hand, a privacy LCD screen protector might be all that's necessary. That, or maybe sinking the LCD into the machine a bit to narrow it's viewing angle then positioning it so that the person would be standing in front of it. Still, you can never be too safe, especially with untraceable money. :)

The machine verifies receipt of transaction using a signed message. If you watch the youtube video it should be more clear. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:24:18
I had never heard of Bitcoin Fog, but it's  interesting to see that we came up with the same solution. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:52:23
Yes, the transaction is signed with a sha254hmac. The website uses the mtgox api and buys then transfers the moment the user enters the code, this has an advantage over the current market devices in that the user can price-watch without standing at the kiosk. The kiosk operator has no risk of volatility because of this as well. Selling works the same way, but in reverse.
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:02:28
Collision would not be any more an issue than a brute force of random kiosk codes since the only way to verify you were correct in the guess would be to submit to the website, the transaction code is always unique, so even with a collision you wouldn't get far, and after so many invalid attempts on the code I could just block your IP address. There would be little financial incentive to brute force attack the website anyway, unlike the shared key, the kiosk code would only get you one transaction. As for hacking the firmware, if you got into the machine... you could steal the money inside it which would be much easier. For an additional $2 I could make the firmware unhackable too:  Also, keep in mind, each kiosk has its own shared key.

It peaks at more than 42 watts. Here is the datasheet for the recycler:

Said they would be back up in a week or two. And that they would support dwolla transfers with 1% commission on trades.

What you say about "any decent mixer" is true. This isn't what blockchain.info mixer does, that's my point. It's not a decent mixer. Also, sending is small chunks does nothing to eliminate the problem if the chunks all add up to an expected unique value within a short timeframe. It makes it more obfuscated, but not more secure from a thorough analysis. (Which can happen at any future date)
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:46:35
I just finished building it. The website needs some work still. I demoed the prototype at Crypto-Currency Conference in Atlanta, October 5. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:25:00
I'm more the technical type, no artistic skills. My apologies.

I don't know if anyone has mentioned this, but you are looking at this the wrong way. It's actually really important to the bitcoin network that the blocks run out of space to store the transactions. If all the transactions fit into every block, there would be very little incentive for people to pay the transaction fees, and even less for people to pay more for transactions which need more priority. Since, eventually, the transaction fees will be the only thing paying the miners, there needs to be a reason to pay them. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:00:37
I will build another model which will have a touchscreen and a graphic-lcd. It will be able to display a URL-encoded QR code, which, I agree would make things easier on the user. (a bit pricier to construct, though) I have plans for it, but no timeline yet.
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:23:28
Thanks! I was thinking, exactly that myself. The prototype I lugged around Crypto-Currency Conference was battery powered and lasted about 100 transactions / one month on a single charge, It shouldn't be much more involved to add solar.
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:03:45
Yes, that and because printers jam and run out of paper. In that case, it would mean losing all your money.
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:11:19
I put the website together quickly, it's not entirely up and running. I'll probably use reCaptcha in the end. I'm not worried because there's no money in the website's mtGox acct at the moment. Thanks for pointing it out though, I agree it's weak.
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:01:25
I like this idea better.

It's because you can trade on mtgox without verifying your identity. That's not an option on bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:44:45
The operator of the kiosk will need to have a mtgox acct (more options on the way) in that mtgox acct they will keep money in their preferred currency (USD for example). Lets say they have $100 in the mtgox acct, when someone puts $20 into the kiosk, and enters that code online, the website uses the mtgox API to place a market order for ($20 - commission) worth of BTC. Then immediately transfers those BTC to the user. It works the same in the other direction -- user sends bitcoins, website converts to USD in mtgox acct, takes commission, sends kiosk withdraw code. Bitcoins never sit in the kiosk operators possession for more than an instant.

They showed it off at the crypto currency conference in atl I attended yesterday.
