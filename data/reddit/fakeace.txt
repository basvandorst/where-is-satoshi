Except the cryptos are technically never on there, just need your seed!

I do agree that Bitcoin can scale to handle orders of magnitude more capacity than it does today.    
But it is indeed my opinion that it won't be solely accomplished by a change in the block size limit.
@_date: 2017-02-20 22:47:21
But the network has not crashed &amp; that is the whole reason why Core is conservative with raising the block size limit and instead moving to other scaling solutions.    
It's not that they don't want bitcoin to scale, they just don't want to scale only using the block size limit with which it is impossible to scale to a sufficient level for global &amp; widespread use anyway.    
Instead they want to keep the core level as small, stable &amp; secure as possible and build scaling solutions on top of this.

Frankly, if you handle substantial amounts of money and are thinking about investing in bitcoin, I would expect you have other &amp; better channels of information than Reddit.

As i understand it now from reading about Factom is that this is actually a layer-2 solution using the bitcoin network for security. [Factom Blog - the-bitcoin-fee-event-cometh](

A central tenet of free markets is that they change through technological innovation that forces market players to adapt. This leads to a better outcome for all by forcing prices down &amp; making products better. Distribution of the profit is always the problem and that's exactly what this discussion is also about.

Exactly, a few days ago i put an offer with a little premium and it got picked up within an hour. Admittedly, this was on the Euro exchange, but i'm sure this works on the other exchanges too.
@_date: 2017-01-16 08:08:52
You can put your own buy offer up. This way you let the 'market' know at which price point you are willing to trade. It's also possible to follow the index price of bitcoinaverage.com plus  a premium in a percentage of the price (a negative percent means you're paying a premium, found that a bit unintuitive, but it works)

I think nobody says increased adoption would harm decentralisation and censorship resistance. Bigger blocks however do impact those characteristics because of rising latency in the network.
Just to make sure you don't conflate those two separate things.

I used Bitsquare a week ago for the first time and everything went just fine. Still early, but a very nice piece of software! It does need more users, so go for it and put up an offer :)

I have one of these as a reminder of what can go wrong with fiat money. Nice to see other people value this lesson too or they just want to be able to say they have 100 trillion dollars, with an evil pinky to go with it. Both are legit reasons to me
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:46:02
I think that is incorrect. The fee you pay to open or close the channel is the amount you should pay according to how full blocks are at that time and how fast you want your transaction of opening or closing the channel to be includes.
Opening or closing a payment channel is the same as making a normal transaction on the blockchain.
Pls someone correct me if i misunderstood this.

This was publicized in July 2016 and is quite positive about it. &amp;nbsp;
Surprisingly Mr Tapscott makes a very clear connection between bitcoin &amp; blockchain and says the way the system of incentives is set up in bitcoin is the reason you get this vast network of mass collaboration on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Do you think there is no difference between how the bitcoin core github project operates in its decision making and how the NY agreement was decided?

I use Kraken. It was the cheapest of all the options I looked at. It's maybe not as easy as other options. There are also no direct debit options, only sepa transfer of funds possible (EU resident).

Probably not a very good comparison, but the gist of the text reminds me of the way the church operates. They don't think in months, years or decades, but in centuries.

I think the selling pressure just moves up one step, because the miners will pay the utilities who will have to convert into fiat to pay for their expenses. 
There is no doubt that it would be a very good step in the right direction of course.

The recovery check is good addition. Haven't tested it yet, but in the past i would just i would transfer my whole balance to a new seed i generated at that time. Just to be sure for in the case i did make a mistake when recording the former seed. it was probably unnecessary, but can't be too sure i guess.

Is it not impossible to make a piece of software inviolable? 
Ok, you can decide for yourself that you will never run another piece of code with changes &amp; updates, but you &amp; anybody else will never have control over everybody else in the network.
Aren't these unavoidable consequences of the network being decentralized with open source software? Or is there some coding voodoo magic to make this a possibility?
If not, I think you will always have to deal with the surrounding politics. That's maybe an inseparable part of this system created &amp; being used by humans.
It gets a bit dirty &amp; chaotic, but until now the system has held up, which is already an incredible accomplishment.
