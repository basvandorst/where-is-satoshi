I'm young, having an active life and actually far away from even thinking about my tombstone, let alone what will be written on it. I actually don't even care about what will be written on my tombstone, so "he's a bitter shit" is absolutely OK with me, even if you thought it would be an insult.

@_date: 2019-07-30 16:55:27
I would do exactly what I've been doing the whole bear market: DCA in ( Dollar Cost Average ). Whenever I get extra fiat, I buy some more BTC. As long as you don't invest more than you can afford to lose, so you don't become emotional and start making bad decisions, it's been proven during the last 10 years, it is a great way to make profit without being a day trader or knowing any TA.
If you start day trading anytime except the euphoria phase (into a bull market, obviously), there are big chances the professional traders and the whales will outplay you and you end up losing money (BTC) more often than gaining more, thus why DCAing remain a very good option for most of the people.

I don't hate myself, nor did I really hate Tyler Jenks. It's just he was full of shit, a dinosaur that was part of the old and corrupt system. And now that he died, it seems almost everybody suddenly forgot how shit he was. I'm glad there are some people who actually claim he was a scammer, even if I don't fully agree with that. In my opinion he was just full of shit ( a hypocrite or a shill, if you want a less offensive term ) and I'm simply glad that he died.

That's why they are called "lagging indicators", so yeah they describe the past rather than the future, but they're a better tool to predict the future, compared to the situation where you didn't had any information whatsoever. Both the 1 day and 3 days golden crosses ( and actually death crosses as well ) were very good to predict the bull markets ( golden crosses ) and the despair phase in the bear markets ( death cross ). You can clearly see the death cross is such a lagging indicator that when it appears usually only the LAST phase of the bear market occur, as the bear market actually started MONTHS before that. Same with the golden cross: the prices don't have to increase the same day or week, but it shows that the trajectory and momentum are towards the bullish side, mid and long term.

What custodial wallets create is NOT Bitcoin! They create an I.O.U. which they may or may not pay, when you chose to withdraw the real BTC. If all the people try to cash out at the same time, they won't be able to deliver more than 21mil Bitcoins, thus they CAN'T create more than 21mil Bitcoins. There will only be 21mil Bitcoins, ever, no matter what. The amount of BTC you see on an exchange, on Coinbase or anywhere else than your own private wallet (where you control the SEED), those are not necessarily Bitcoins. They may or may not be backed by real Bitcoin, but you can't check that. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin

It's clear by now you're simply retarded. Just downvoted you and moving along, no point wasting my time explaining you again. For anyone else reading the thread: SEC can delay an ETF past what people call "final deadline". The whole procedure is legal and explained into their documents. it also happened before so it's not just theoretical. If you are as retarded as the previous guy is, you won't reserach further what I've just wrote. Otherwise, just google for it and also the very few posts on reddit where other users raised questions about how how such a thing was possible ( delaying it past the "final deadline" - which is not final at all )

@_date: 2018-09-15 13:51:22
You're either retarded or simply don't want to learn.
They DID it in the past with some previous BTC ETFs, there was also a post about the procedure some weeks ago with a link to SEC's "ToS" where it clearly states which are the delays ( the 30, 60 180 days delay that people talk about ) and the same document is clearly stating it can be delayed indefinitely until the commission is able to take a decision.
Once again, this is NOT an opinion, it's what their own rules say.

It was obvious from the beginning for all of us who weren't brain-washed that terrorists use fiat money to fund their operations, as they did that way before crypto even existed!
@_date: 2018-09-21 09:31:59
Based on the same logic, we don't need Bakkt either. There's no reason why we would need Bakkt, but not need ETFs or vice-versa.
The truth is we didn't need either of them from the very beginning. If they come, good for them, but it's not like anyone should beg or even ask them. Bitcoin is working fine for 10 years and will continue to do so with or without Bakkt or ETFs approval or any other "regulation" invented by "experts".

Which "we" ? I didn't as this is totally against what Bitcoin stands for. You just want to make $$$ to spend them on Lambos thus why you don't care about the principles.
They can fuck off with their Bakkt and ETFs anytime from my point of view. All I care is the LN development, the introduction of privacy features to BTC and so on.
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:16:12
If the BTC price doesn't go -10% in the next 24 hours, then we know we're not in a bear market anymore, regardless of what "TA Experts" say.
Back in the old days when it struggled around $6k, this type of FUD would have instantly dropped BTC 5% then slowly bleed another 5% during the first 24 hours.
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:16:13
TL;DR: Some top banksters (supposedly) laundered a shit ton of dirty fiat money and instead of sending them into prison, " the government would &lt;tighten anti-money laundering even more.&gt;"
So even even less privacy for the honest citizens and no harm at all for the perpetrators.

Crypto 101: Never put more FIAT money into your bank account or Crypto money into an exchange that you can afford to lose. Not your key, not your money. Since FIAT money don't have a private key that you can hold, it means those were never your money in the first place. Basically, the government allowed you to use those money and now they don't allow you anymore. Simple as that!
Also, there is no such thing as liberal country. All of them are totalitarian regimes which want full control over everything, it's just some states APPEAR to give you more freedom than the others. You will eventually end up broke, in jail or dead whenever your regime wants, regardless of your illusion of freedom. This applies for any person, in any country.

Don't do what any of these guys are telling you, like downloading a software wallet and importing your keys there!
The only real and SAFE way to do it is by ordering another Trezor from the official website and importing your seed into the new device. They have a text tutorial about that and if you don't understand it, you can use youtube, as there are video tutorials about the subject as well.

What's crazy is the fact that this guy seem to be serious about it. So you should be "very transparent and polite" ( aka kiss their asses ) and then, MAYBE then "and you should be able to access the funds within a week.

This is the only post worth replying. I was talking about the future market, as that's what the initial theory ( not my theory, I've read it couple weeks ago ) was all about. Shorting the bitcoin, on the future market, continuously until it reaches very low values and almost everyone loses the trust in it ( and possibly replaced by another coin invented by banksters or a state, which will be shamelessly promoted as the future of crypto to the unaware crowd ). 
People only seem to downvote such posts thinking I'm trolling, but all I'm doing is describing a theory that involves a hybrid attack ( economical, backed by state/corporate propaganda ) against bitcoin. 
Since you seem to be a reasonable person, would you care to explain why such an attack wouldn't be possible ?

No, I just downvote you and anyone posting news about SEC, instead of focusing on the real development like LN, Schnorr Signatures, Taproot and so on, as I automatically mark you as a speculator instead of someone being genuinely interested about Bitcoin.

And one of those options is to downvote you, in addition to calling you out for the FUD and useless bankster "news" ( in reality, masked FUD ).

There were some statistics  posted by another redditor and it claimed that even if you bought at 20k, you'd still be in a profit today as long as you kept DCA-ing (dollar cost averaging) the same amount every month. So even if you bought at the very top, as long as you kept buying the same amount every month, you're in a profit as we speak.
I don't see any reason why it would be a nightmare for anyone. The only way you can be down by investing in Bitcoin is to invest in the worst possible time and not buy more. If you bought more, constantly, it's  mathematically impossible to be at a loss today.

This type of persons is what I called "completely brainwashed or very new to the crypto scene". Despite the evidence, he keeps trying to find counter arguments simply to argue, not because it has any relevance.
Obviously, even if he was right ( he's not, BTC is $6700+ at this very moment) a $200 price difference would be nothing and it would actually support what I wrote in the initial post. The fact that the BTC is still $6700+ confirms, once again, against all the skeptics' opinions, that the BTC price is NOT correlated with the events. The events are used as "alibi", but there's not a direct correlation between them for quite a while...

Make sure to keep them somewhere safe if you don't have experience with it. You will probably start with a custodial service like Coinbase where you don't control the private keys, but over time you'll have to consider purchasing a hardware wallet and be your own bank, which means you don't depend on anyone to hold your BTC.

Yes, purchase at Kraken, THEN START LEARNING ABOUT CRYPTO, then buy a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger ( they're the most known in the industry ). It's very important to learn about crypto before you move the coins out of Kraken because any mistake most of the time will have consequences and some actions might be irreversible. For example, if you send your coins to a wrong address, you'll lose them. Of course, once you understand how to make a transfer, what a private key is and so on, you'll never actually make such mistakes, thus why I recommend you start learning about crypto by watching tutorials, reading articles and so on. For now, you can make a purchase and keep the coins on Kraken. Once you feel comfortable and get some more knowledge, get yourself a hardware wallet and move the funds there. Hardware wallets don't need you to sign up anywhere, they are literally physical wallets. Here's a video that compares Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets and shows you how they actually look like and how to use them:

People sometimes recommend Kraken over Coinbase. It is reasonably safe to believe they won't run away with your BTC considering they have quite a decent history of being legit. However, they are still a CUSTODIAL solution, which means if the site gets hacked or if anything happens to their hot or cold wallets or if the admins go rogue and so on, you MIGHT lose your BTC. This is relatively unlikely to happen, but it has happen in the past with websites like Mt GOX ( which was the biggest in the world at that time ), so it can definitely happen at some point.
That's why the recommendation is, after you make the purchase and once you get more familiar with crypto and how it works, to get a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger and not depend on anyone else to hold your BTC, but rather hold it by yourself. which means to be in control of the private keys.
As written earlier, it's OK to start with Kraken or Coinbase or any other big and well known company, but eventually you'll want to be in full control of your coins and hold them in a hardware wallet.

Asianconnect88 will require KYC even if you use BTC, I've tested it personally. Only bet once, won, they asked for KYC and told them to go fuck themselves, so WOULDN'T recommend them at all.
Nitrogen is also shit and might ban your whole region without any announcement. Not sure if they require KYC, as I've never put a bet after they ninja banned quite a few countries for days/weeks without any prior announcement.
Both websites do pay you, so they're not scams, but the overall experience with them was bad and KYC was still required. I won't shill any sportsbook, just pointing out these two are not as reliable as they're presented in ads or shill campaigns.

1.People believe Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme because they're retards and don't understand how it works.
2.People believe Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme because it has one of the elements: the network effect. They wrongfully think everything that include people gathering or referring each other to increase the network size ends up into a Ponzi scheme. That is obviously wrong, but even if it was true, then it means nations and fiat would be the biggest Ponzi schemes since they're bigger in size than the Bitcoin network ( population wise )
3.People don't truly believe Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, but claim so simply because they're being paid or coerced by the elites in order to deter people going into crypto and keep using the fiat they print almost for free and in unlimited amounts.

Well, not even the LTC devs know for sure which option to chose, so the discussion of implementing any of these in Bitcoin is probably non existent at this point. For BTC, the discussion revolves more around Schnorr signatures, Taproot and Graftroot when it comes to this.
What I know for sure is the fact that there are voices like Andreas Antonopoulos claiming that privacy is even more important than scalability at this point and that it has to be implemented into the first layer (which is the current blockchain ), instead of being just an optional solution for the 2nd layer ( the LN ). I completely agree with that, but you should google for his opinion regarding this simply because he's explaining it much better and has much more patience talking about this subject that I will ever have.

Of course it would, but it won't be nowhere as secure as it is now. It would work with POS, it would work with DPOS and so on. The point is POW is the best option you have if you want a secure blockchain. Nobody solved the trilema so far ( security, scalability, decentralization ) on L1. If you give up POW and use DPOS for example, you give up security and and decentralization, but greatly improve scalability
However, no sane mind would even consider switching from POW to POS or DPOS in Bitcoin. The way to solve the trilemma was to create an L2 solution like the Lightning Network in order to fix the scalability problem ( which is the only problem Bitcoin has ). Also, if anyone choses to fork off Bitcoin and use POS instead of POW, it just won't be Bitcoin anymore, but rather an altcoin which forked off Bitcoin.

Nobody can exit scam you as long as you keep the coins in your wallet, so 100% guaranteed security. With fiat, in many counties it's illegal to even keep the money by yourself (if it exceeds a specific threshold, depending on each country ). The bank actually can run with your money and on top of that, the government itself can be corrupt and it simply evaporates your fiat value by hyperinflation, just like it happened in Venezuela.
The bolivar is down 99%+ of it's value, while Bitcoin is up a couple thousands % compared to 10 years ago!

You're not right about the situation. The Templars HAD custody of pilgrim's wealth and could refuse to deliver it. What the pilgrims had was an encrypted I.O.U certificate. The Templars, most probably, delivered most of the times, but as we know, when something goes bad, I.O.U. certificate become useless and you can't redeem your wealth. If the Templars were slaughtered or were imprisoned en-masse - which actually happened on a 13th, thus the "Friday the 13th unlucky" expression, the pilgrim's encrypted letter would become useless.

The best way to do it is to DCA ( dollar cost average ) in small amounts ( 5k, in your case ) rather than spending everything at a specific price. It has been proven time after time and it doesn't require any TA so you don't have to ask yourself every day if the bottom is already in. Even if BTC looks very good and about to explode, you can never really know if it will explode tomorrow and reach ATH in 2020 or if it will dip to 3k first and then reach ATH. If you DCAed in for the past 10 years, you didn't have to worry about these scenarios at all and still make a profit.

I don't rule the possibility that you are correct and I am the diiot, but I've read the article and from this exact quote, I actually understood they've already sold around 77,000 BTC from  total of around 180,000, so they've only got around 100k BTC left, not 180k as you claim. Even If they plan to sell everything (they may stop selling at some point ), it means they've already sold ALMOST HALF of what they had. The exact quote from the article is:
" ErgoBTC:	From there I evaluated the, the history of that transaction and was able to sort of verify at least how much through that address had been sold. I think around by now, I think it’s around 77,000 that I was able to cluster through that address. "

The reason for implementing them in any coin is the same one as Charlie Lee stated: to increase the fungibility of the coin.
Since we live in a totalitarian world, they have invented the terms "money laundering" and "terrorist financing", which can be applied to anything, regardless of the facts. Thus, one day you might get SWATed, after receiving your 1147th payment in Bitcoin simply because the 1147th payment contained a fraction of BTC that your government considered to be "tainted" ( it comes from a darknet transaction, someone paid a hitmain with it, then was caught by the Feds and so on ). By receiving a "tainted" fraction of a coin, they can (and WILL) mark you as tainted as well since in their view you may have connections with the initial wallet ( they can determine that by analyzing the blockchain and there are already specialized companies doing that ). This just one of the MANY reasons why both LTC and BTC are considering such options and it doesn't have anything to do with the price increase. It's part of the fundamentals!

You will be long gone by the time you check your bitcoin wallet, as the thieves and burglars will take the opportunity to storm your house, rape and kill your wife and daughter, torture you till you tell them where you keep absolutely everything of value, then kill you as well and get away with everything. Accessing or maintaining the Bitcoin network will be the least of your concern if a severe geomagnetic storm occurs anytime soon. You're just trying to spread FUD by pointing out BTC ain't as good as "paper money", even if you don't directly say it.

@_date: 2018-07-30 17:32:47
Absolutely. Venezuela had problems for quite a while as well. Argentina is having problem too, but not as severe as Zimbabwe and Venezuela.
What I meant was that Venezuela is getting attention in 2018, just as Zimbabwe did in 2017 on the crypto forums. Who know who'll be the topic in 2019, but what we can see is that more and more countries have problems with their economies and it starts to become more and more obvious, even for the new comers, that the fiat system is doomed.

This is actually a good article and it has a proper title. Not sure why it gets downvoted, as the fuckers in this case are the SEC members (minus the lady who's pro crypto ), not the guy who wrote/posted the article.
The guy is just presenting the whole situation mainly from the perspective of SEC, along with their old fashioned and corrupt system. It's not an article against crypto or BTC, but rather an article that shows how the SEC fuckers think about crypto and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-26 01:22:01
This kind of situation makes me realize how much potential Bitcoin has. Since everything is relatively hard to set up for a newcomer / non-geek and a lot of banks are still closing accounts or doing their best to stop people dealing with crypto, yet the price is still around 6-8-10k, it's kinda hard to even imagine the price when buying crypto with fiat will be as easy as buying something from Amazon.
Coinbase always had problems, all kind of problems. They're also very slow to respond whenever you have a problem, but once again - it has always been like that. There are alternatives, but if you wanna avoid paying the 5-10% premium for P2P trades or using an ATM, then you'll have yo stick to the big companies.
The reason why it's harder to buy crypto when dealing with a big company like Coinbase is the fact that your bank will definitely know what you're up to and if they have a negative stance on cryptos, they won't allow the transaction. As weird as it sounds, using a smaller/lesser known company, despite having higher chances to get scammed, usually ends up well simply because your bank won't know that you're sending FIAT money for crypto.

I think they are legit. For example, I can double your money as well. Let's say you have $50 and I have $50 as well. You send me your $50, so I'll have $100 in total, so I just doubled your money. The tricky part is that I'll never send you the money back, but still the claim is to "double your money", not to give you the money back.
@_date: 2018-07-09 11:24:16
I can't verify the OP's statements, but I agree with him from my personal experience. Even during the dec-january hype, the people I knew only ASKED about Bitcoin, but most of them never bought any, nor invested in any other crypto. 
The very few that put some money in only "invested" ridiculously low amounts like $150-200. (they are spending more than on computer games alone on a monthly basis) And I'm talking about persons who had a well paid job, $30-40k cars, their own house and so on. Even so, the Bitcoin reached $20k and the whole market was close to $1 Trillion, so we can hardly imagine what it will happen when people will actually start to invest in in, rather than just reading news or talking with the cab drivers about it.  And that's without any institutional money being involved!
If you add institutional money, it's really hard to imagine the market cap of the whole crypto industry.

They will approve it whenever they want. More specifically, only after their protégés loaded their bags with enough crypto in order to make a huge profit during the next bull run triggered by the EFT approval news.
So whenever they and the corrupt banksters around them consider they have enough crypto, they will hit the "ETF Approval" button. It has absolutely nothing to do with the fundamentals or protecting the future investors and so on.

You're obviously a fucking bankster shill, so I have to call you out.
Not only you tried to spin it around when someone asked about international payments ( which OBVIOUSLY AREN'T free ), but you don't present any proof or bank's name either.
Don't believe this retard, just scroll down where he admits the international transfers aren't actually free for him, he doesn't give details regarding his bank, nor presents any proof.
In my country I pay for everything, from internet banking access, having a bank account, national and international transfers so I knew right away he was bullshitting. I am aware there are better conditions in other countries, but it becomes SO OBVIOUS when someone is exaggerating and trying to mislead people, which is exactly what he does.

Poor article, sorry to tell you this. I was expecting an article that explains how the banksters are trying to inflate Bitcoin by the use of derivatives or, at least, how exchanges supposedly operate on fractional reserve Bitcoin ( thus the "Proof of Keys" event in January ). Obviously, the chance of inflating Bitcoin by using just software or consensus is very low, but that was always obvious.

Giving them money is worse than giving the bank your money and hope for a return. If it was viable, you can imagine banks would give a higher rate then Blockfi for the money that you "lend".
The point is, there's no guarantee you'll even get your BTC back. Sure, in the first months I'm pretty sure everything's gonna be OK, people will earn interest and so on, but just don't be surprised if one day they will refuse to pay both your interest and the initial amount you invested. Afterall, even Bitconnect worked very well in the first months...

Yes, he just admitted he's too retarded to take care of himself. I would say he should stay with fiat, as Bitcoin wasn't created for such people anyway.

Oh, the irony :)
There were news about 1 year ago that these fuckers ILLEGALLY froze someone's BTC (about 15-20 BTC ) as they suspected that person was involved in money laundering. During a couple days or weeks, that person submited all the documents, proof of funds and so on and finally had the BTC unfrozen and able to withdraw. It's worth mentioning they froze the funds AT THEIR OWN WILL, BASED ON NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER, and not because they were requested by any authority to do so! ( this is the reason why the whole scandal started and the community was outraged)
And now, after not even 1 year, THEY, the very same company owners, got charged and arrested for Money Laundering. It can't get any better :)))))))))))))))))))

There is also a possibility that theymos ( *which initially posted this, instead of Aussiehash* ) or any other mod/admin here have a SHORT position on Bitmex and don't want Bitcoin to moon anytime soon, thus the "advice" not to invest recklessly.
It is a bit of a conspiracy theory, but it's weird the advice came NOW, when everybody expected the price to pull back once it hit the 6400 resistance and when most people took SHORT positions thinking BTC will rather retrace to $4500 levels (or lower ).
The advice itself ISN'T WRONG, I even agree with the post, it's just i find the TIMING TO BE VERY SUSPICIOUS. This advice is correct all the time, yet some mod/admin decided to post it now, when BTC did an unexpected move, instead of having it stickied the entire year or month for example.
Just saying that if "someone" had an open SHORT position on Bitmex and also had the advantage of being able to make sticky reddit posts on a community with more than 1 million people, HE MIGHT BE TEMPTED to influence the crowd based on his own interest, by posting some "advice" that at first sight seems completely legit, but if you dig deeper, you might find out it's not as legit and sincere as it initially appeared.
It's pretty much what Mcafee did with his "coin of the week / coin of the day" when pumped and dumped coins by influencing a lot of people to buy when he tweeted.
Also, isn't it weird that we, the normal users, are getting censored and our posts removed when posting about price, yet this thread, if you actually read the content, TALKS about the price and actually gives financial advice ?
NOT to invest in COIN X actually IS financial advice, just as "invest in coin X" is another type of financial advice, even if the initial one doesn't seem like.
Just pointing out a lot of red flags regarding this so called "wise advice", as well as the timing when it was posted...
Later edit: Also, why was "theymos" replaced by "Aussiehash" as the creator of this thread, all of a sudden ? Which of the subreddit mods/admins silently edited it and why ?
