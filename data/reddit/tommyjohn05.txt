Mass adoption of bitcoin, and the infrastructure to legally do what you’re saying, is still far away. We could stand this up in 1-2 months and allow you access to buy or put money towards any home nationwide.

Diversity of payment options, also betting on  substantial organic growth.

One could say you made the *switch* from Crypto.

If you’re on any centralized exchange how do you avoid the paper trail?

Yea it’s legal for sure. But isn’t the pool of people very small?

To the partner it would always be fiat. Their side of the process never changes.

Yea I agree with this. However, even as crypto gains momentum, it’s going to be a while before everyone understands decentralization vs how we think and use currency today.
I.e why coinbase is currently so popular. It’s understandable to the masses.

How about hundreds of dollars towards the down payment?
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:13:30
What about just facilitating the down payment 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:53:31
Realistically though, like an affordable sedan or something lol.

Sorry I’ll update the post. United States.

Personal experience?

The number of sellers that would accept bitcoin for their home seems incredibly small. We could allow you to buy whatever home you wanted, or better yet facilitate the down payment on any home you want.

Unfortunately you’re not getting passed capital gains, especially if you’re using a centralized exchange.
Don’t mess with the IRS!

Vehicles aren’t really an item people save for. Homes yes. People really should save for unexpected purchases.
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:16:03
We have the infrastructure to allow you do so. Our company already operates today using just USD to facilitate the down payment / purchase. We’d like to open the product up to crypto users if there’s a want for it.

I currently have a 100k withdraw limit. Should be ok. I just wanna do it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:04:47
Would you want to buy a car or home? Are you currently in the market? If so, would you mind giving me a little detail on what kind of car or home? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:57:55
Awesome! Hodl my friend!
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:59:20
Hell might as well get a cool 100.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:03:12
You’d still be buying with fiat. We just offer incentives (free money :D) and the convenience of getting the funds to your destination.

Good to know that China can potentially flip the blockchain on its head if they want. Considering they most likely have more Mining power than the rest of the world combined. 
 please confirm.

You get coins at the price you purchased. Regardless of funds clearing right?
