Open up a trouble ticket with Synapsepay with the details of the ticket number and the details of your wire transfer.  Synapsepay responded in 2 business days saying the wire was received by Kraken same day sent, didn't know what Kraken did with it and copied them on the ticket.  Literally 5 minutes after that, Kraken credited the deposit to our account.

I've received this same email from Kraken for my USD wire transfer that they have not credited for 14 days now.  We're tier 4 verified and have done previous wires without issue.  If they are having technical issues with USD funding, why doesn't their website say that and why are they still allowing their customers to initiate USD wire transfers??

Can't see liking a support team that can't give an answer as to what the problem is or when it will be solved for a wire transfer that was done 2 weeks ago (9/15)?  They have the money, my account does not.  That's not support.

Haha...you obviously have never had a transfer held up.  Wire transfer should go thru same day, next business day as a worst case.  Nor have Kraken support team say wait 5 days before they even look, then don't answer the ticket for days, then give you some bullshit answer like kraken-daniel has posted on here and the bullshit email from Kraken saying they don't know when it would be fixed that started this whole thread.

I got the same message from them for a $5300 USD wire transfer initiated on 9/15...still no answer from Kraken.  Yet they are still allowing USD wire transfers.  BEWARE OF KRAKEN, no support, no answers on their tickets or from their supposed google form to escalate the ticket.

I escalated via this form yesterday morning and still no response from Kraken.  2 weeks and no explanation.  If Kraken is having issues with USD transfers, why don't you say that on your website and why are you still allowing your customers to initiate them??

Yep...waiting on a transfer from 9/15...no useful response from Kraken support.  Opened a ticket with Synapsepay (their bank doing the wire transfers), no response from them either.  And of course, neither Kraken or Synapsepay have any phone numbers or email addresses you can reach directly.
