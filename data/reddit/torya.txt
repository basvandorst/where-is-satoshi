That would be a great idea!
@_date: 2015-06-17 08:37:48
I'll use this only if it built on bitcoin side chain.
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:57:51
Does exist any similar project built on the bitcoin blockchain? I would prefer using it because Augur is built on ethereum and not on the bitcoin blockchain.
 
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:48:55
I would do it for you if you would buy one for me :)
@_date: 2014-12-18 17:00:19
nothing new... just the same shit we already heard
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:15:38
How long do you plan to hold it?
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:49:50
This KYC stuff is getting ridiculous!
We need decentralized exchanges!!!
@_date: 2014-08-14 13:02:23
For example because people don't know the exact reason behind the sudden price drop.
@_date: 2014-06-18 10:49:23
You are speaking my mind!

Have you tried igot.com?
@_date: 2014-12-04 13:34:59
This isn't really surprising but thanks to share it anyway.
@_date: 2014-11-01 13:31:04
Yes, I see it's MTGoxUSD!
But who cares, this year is indeed a terrible year for bitcoin price!
@_date: 2014-10-08 09:38:52
Sure, we need bitcoin ATMs in every airports!
@_date: 2014-10-06 21:47:03
Great, psychopath ManBearWhale :)
@_date: 2014-05-30 07:01:48
Nice! I like this software! Please ask the developers to put a bitcoin donation address on the site!!!
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:34:30
I've voted! It would be awsome if they would accept BTC!

bitcoin + mesh net
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:27:31
They should use bitcoin instead of a new currency.
@_date: 2014-05-18 09:07:26
Great idea!!!
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:54:26
One reason more to use BTC instead of VISA
@_date: 2014-08-09 20:38:46
You can disable this by running it with "--skip-annuonce-check"

good idea!
@_date: 2014-08-05 20:06:44
It would be great if they would accept btc!
Everyone who has interest should write them!
I'll write them too!

My donation on the way!

@_date: 2014-10-28 14:48:41
@_date: 2014-11-14 16:20:06
yes, I totally agree with you

It doesn't matter ripple will be soon a bitcoin sidechain ;)
@_date: 2014-10-26 21:53:40
Few days ago I had to wait more than 24 hours for my bitcoin withdrawal request...

Thanks for your hint, next time I'll try out your strategy. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:27:10
@_date: 2014-10-28 09:29:45
We need to switch to bits...
That also would have psychological effect to the price!
@_date: 2014-10-08 11:24:08
Seems to be interesting!
Maybe I would buy one.
@_date: 2014-11-29 08:15:12
It would be nice if more websites would use .bit domains and not / or not just) .io
@_date: 2014-05-15 08:02:50

@_date: 2014-07-12 11:57:36
Who cares about it! This is r/bitcoin and not r/ripple!
@_date: 2014-05-29 07:27:30
I've found these on github:
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:10:52
Ethereum does not working! Ethereum does not have any blockchain!
Counterparty has a secure blockchain and it's already in production mode.
And this is a big difference!
@_date: 2014-09-03 11:43:39

Where can I download the latest normally working version (7.1a) ?
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:08:50
the banks pay them :)
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:46:39
I can't see any proof of this theory in the article.
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:43:41
Ohh! The price of XRP will fall buy fast bitcoins :D 
@_date: 2014-11-20 12:55:37
Vitalik seems to worry about the success of his altchain / altcoin.
After the announcement of the Sidechains project and Counterparty Etehereum implementation I would also worry if I would be him :D
Counterparty and Sidechains will kill the Ethereum project.
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:25:56
This report is a bullshit!
@_date: 2014-07-29 09:56:11
There are only few alternatives, and the exchange rates are worse at de-centralized exchanges.
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:09:32
I won't donate them until I can't see bitcoin as payment option on their main donation page: 
@_date: 2014-11-14 09:30:28
Great article!

I wish I would be able to close my bank account, but sadly I need it too often for the present. I hope in the near future I’ll be able to live without a bank account.
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:47:07
I don't need to take any drog to have the same conclusion:)
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:04:17
Hey!! 
You left out from your theory the most important momentum:
we'll have half moon on Nov 14th!
@_date: 2014-10-01 09:44:13
Please Reddit don't create an other altcoin!!!
Build on Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-11-23 12:53:49
ha-ha funny
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:26:51
Ahh! Quickcoin again.
Ok it's cool but this isn't a native facebook feature.
Hopefully facebook also will do something with bitcoin in the future!
@_date: 2014-11-14 16:41:21
They don't need to tell anyone that they are using it :)
@_date: 2014-11-28 14:30:10
Maybe because you have to buy SWARM coin to use it.
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:02:45
Why can't I use their service without facebook/linkedin/google account ?!? I hate those services which force to use these spy sites!
@_date: 2014-10-01 14:12:46

@_date: 2014-10-21 10:16:49
I don't get it, what is this movie about?
@_date: 2014-05-17 05:45:22
Cool! I've sent them few bits.
@_date: 2014-11-12 10:09:39
You would need few sexy girls to spread the love :D
Thanks for your effort!
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:25:42
This is just waste of time nobody will use this!
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:26:06
The most interesting quote is this:
*"The idea here is that nodes would charge money for a data connection"*
Will Foxtrot  be a mesh network and the nodes will earn bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:21:41
All the exchanges should use bits instead of BTC!
This would cause network effect and everyone would switch from BTC to bits.
@_date: 2014-11-01 13:08:40
It's  hard to believe that a so amazing and  disruptive technology like bitcoin has still so small market cap!
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:35:59

@_date: 2014-11-14 13:23:45

I can't see the connections.
Misleading title!

What is the URL of the live stream?
I've found it:
@_date: 2014-10-30 10:42:32
Bitcoin + mesh networks !!!
The nodes of the mesh network will get paid in bitcoin according their traffic. And this will happen in the background on the level of the network protocol!

@_date: 2014-09-04 12:47:35

@_date: 2014-11-02 09:45:42
Does it exist an open source software with I could setup a site like localbitcoins.com?

you're right! Namecoin is a brilliant idea but should be easier to use.
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:02:31
sounds good
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:13:05
I've found the answer to my question on their website:
**How do I find projects? Why is there no search function?**
*You find them via the web, social networks, etc. Lighthouse does not include a global list of all projects or a search function, because a global list would rapidly become cluttered without centralised and ongoing curation and search is a hard problem better solved by companies like Google, Bing, Facebook etc.*
*We hope that project gallery sites will be created and compete with each other to collect curated lists of projects for specific communities. The Vinumeris Crypto Projects Gallery is a simple example of what a project gallery can be like.*
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:23:01
@_date: 2015-01-16 10:59:53
you are dreaming :)
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:36:48
What does here 'Open Source' exactly mean?
@_date: 2015-04-10 00:03:47
I understand this but my point is that you can't update the dynamic web pages too frequently because the process of the update is too slow.
@_date: 2015-04-09 23:48:22
Scaling is just one thing.
Hosting dynamic websites on zeronet is a pain.
You need to have outbound connections otherwise you can't update the site frequently.
And if I need connections outside the zeronet why would I use zeronet?!
I could just distribute my javascript app in a torrent file without the overhead of zeronet stuff.
@_date: 2015-04-09 23:16:42
The concept of ZeroNet probably won't work.
There are basic design problems with it.
@_date: 2015-04-09 23:21:09
ZeroNet = javascript apps in a torrent file
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:40:29
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:46:18
Superb plan! I would like to invest in it! :D
@_date: 2015-02-09 16:30:23
So bitcoin's 6,000 year bubble just begun :)
Good news!
