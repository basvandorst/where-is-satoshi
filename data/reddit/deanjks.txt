I would say the price tag of 1 million per bitcoin factors in parabolic adoption + devaluation of Fiat, as people start transacting in bitcoin more and more (or using it as a hedge for when the financial crash comes round)
The problem I see is that the bitcoin protocol is not yet ready for that kind of adoption, the technology is not yet scalable. So imo, we wont see that kind of price tag for a few years. 
Edit: Heres my [source]( for the parablic adoption phase of cryptocurrencies

@_date: 2017-12-08 01:10:55
For Clarity, the reason I believe their will be significant pullbacks because the price is getting ahead of where the tech is. The blockchain is yet to be able to scale, and security is still an issue. Transaction are slow and expensive. 
**However**, the long term value proposition of bitcoin is huge. Predicting the short term price is a fools errand. So generally I agree with what you're saying. 
And you what, as a store of value, slow and expensive doesn't mean jack shit. So maybe this will have little affect. [heres my post on bitcoin as a store of value]( . The fact that is the first viable escape from the USD might be its largest bull flag ever.

Excellent analysis, thanks for sharing. As you mentioned, the current inflationary system rewards consumers and not savers. While this system encourages advancements in society, it also encourages modern day consumerism. In Laymans terms, we spend money on bullshit, constantly live in debt or on the edge of debt, and as a result are slaves to the wage, in which we live an unhappy 9-5 lifestyle just to keep us going.

Sure he stepped down, but do you not think that the financial elite are clawing their way into bitcoin through governance and regulation. Central bankers and governments have a monopoly over their Fiat monetary system and they aren't about to let a digital currency intervene with their current systems of control.

So let me get this straight, Bitcoin core developers are funded by blockstream who are funded by AXA ventures? Is the development of the bitcoin code really that centralised, because that seems to be a huge threat to the protocol that not many people know about. We need truly decentralised governance if we're going to take back control of the world. 
Maybe this was their plan all along. To lead the revolution. Controlling both sides of the fight.

Im weary of privacy and security of Iphones. [Stories like this]( where the a FBI was able to bypass encryption. iPhones are ultimately spy devices, they are indeed tracking you, google is selling your search history and you will see targeted ads on facebook, which is only the beginning. I reccomend a hardwallet like Ledger or Trezor, where your private keys never leave the device and you have physical buttons to confirm transactions. Untill you have a hardware wallet, just use a temporary computer wallet (or IOS if you really want), use the links on the sidebar. Also look into Tails OS - cryptographically secure your PC, its free and open source

It could be likely that governments and the financial elite now have their hands in bitcoin. Controlled opposition is the potential tatic they use where they have influence over both major parites.

I agree. Security is a huge issue. The fact that you have to be your own bank is not something mainstream society is accustomed to. However the technology is still young, but Im sure there will be solutions developed to help protect a persons wallet. 
Another Issue is the deflationary model of currency. A deflationary model encourages savers which results in less spending which results in less jobs. However I would argue that such a system would actually improve the quality of live for citizens. An Inflationary system rewards consumers, and not savers. Which encourages modern day consumerism. This then leads to the 1st world problems we have today, were many people live on the edge of debt and are a slave to the 9-5 minimum wage with no quality of life.

This is the outcome of a decentralised system. You have to be your own bank. I suppose the question is would you rather have this system or a currency that is controlled, manipulated and lured with gatekeepers and middlemen.

Yes ripple has its governance centralised. 99% of alt coins do as well. Even bitcoin core's governance is becoming centralised. Bitcoin core devs come from private companies, blockstream and chaincode labs, both of which have outside investors. Huge conflict of Interest there. Blockstream devs also outted Gavin Andersen, who satoshi left as the lead developer when he left the project. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:35:04
Satoshi left Gavin Andersen in charge of the project. Gavin proposed a small blocksize increase to reduce scalability problems. A blocksize increase to 8mb does virtually nothing to mining centeralisation. Not to mention mining already is centralised in china anyway. This proposal was constantly denied by blockstream devs. Conviently for them, keeping the blocksize limit at 1mb ensures that off-chain solutions be not only developed, but *mandatory* for the network. 
Blockstream have a vested Interest in ensuring not even a small blocksize increase came to bitcoin. Their Lightning Network will have to have centralised middlemen who can pay these transaction fees once the transaction is broadcasted to the the network. You can see why keeping on chain fees at the highest possible level benefits blockstream, who take a cut on their LN implementation.
AXA obviously benefits because they are the investors of blockstream who profit off blockstreams profits. Not to mention off chain scaling creates centralising middlemen which benefit the financial elite who will not easily give up their system of control to a digital currency.

However Blockstream *do* have an agenda. Unfortunately the part I can't get over is the fact that the LN creates centralising middlemen, which is why they opposed even the smallest of blocksize increases. The financial elite, the members of the [Bidleberg group]( are in positions of authority and are unlikely to give up their status, power and control to a digital currency without some sort of stake and control in it.

Great response. Both an Inflationary and deflationary currency system have their problems. 
Right now we're seeing the full effects of an Inflationary currency system. Profits and rampant consumerism are leaving people overworked, unhappy and living on the edge of debt. 
A deflationary currency system would promote saving money and/or spending it on goods and services that are worthy. Economists would argue GDP would plummet but does it really matter? People would lead happier lives. Currently, the system Isn't designed for a deflationary currency system because energy, water and food are all monopolised. However if we were self-sufficient with solar energy, rain water and vertical farms, I would argue that such a currency system would actually work.

Great question. Bitcoin has crashed 7 times in the past. And each time, its value soared to new heights. There is no protection or regulation against crashes. The market has boom and bust cycles just like every other. 
People have lost faith in the current Fiat system, because ultimately, if you have the power to control a currency, at some point, you will be corrupted by that power. In recent years, the regulators have also been captured and no longer act as safeguards. Just look at the 2008 financial collapse in the US. Regulators failed big time.
However, the aspect of no regulation or central control is exactly why the bitcoin protocol has gained popularity. It is 100% decentralised, from governance, to usage. It is the first currency for the people, by the people. Bitcoin has many other attributes; peer to peer, borderless, permissionless, open source and hence censorship resistant.

The recent surge is mostly due to public awareness (People see the exponential rise and want in). The return on Investment has been higher than any market we have ever seen, so naturally this attracts alot of attention. 
You can think of this market similar to the dot-com markets of the late 90s. During that era, we witnessed the birth of the Internet and the bubble that came with it. Right now we're witnessing the birth of blockchain technology, and hence the bubble that comes with it.
You can research what the blockchain is but I'll try to quickly explain. In essence, it allows for the creation of decentralised services. Bitcoin is the worlds first decentralised currency. It has no owners, no central servers, anyone can chose to participate and join the network. Its peer to peer (no middlemen), permissionless (no gatekeepers), open source (anyone can view the code/ monetary policy). This system is the exact opposite of what we currently have with the central banking system, where the fed had exclusive power over the currency.

Tulips were a 'fad'. They had no utility other than appearance. Style and social norms change over time, and that was no exception. 
Edit: But yes, speculation has propelled us into bubbly territory. However I wouldn't except a crash to 0.

Is there a video I can watch of this moment? Or news website that has the dialogue

What would be another threat to central banks besides cryptocurrency?

Before you do that, I suggest understanding exactly why bitcoin is so revolutionary. Heres my favourite video on the issue, [Money as a system of control]( by Andreas Antonopoulos

Nice to see some genuine analysis here. I personally don't see cryptocurrencies replacing fiat just yet for a number of reasons. 1, Is the deflationary currency system issue that you pointed out. 2, Is the security/safety issues that comes with being your own bank. If your private keys get stolen, lost, or you make a typo/get a computer virus that changes your send address to another wallet, your bitcoin is gone forever. 3, As you pointed out, scalability. 
As a currency, It has problems. However I would argue that Bitcoin has turned into a legitimate store of value (like digital gold) for people to park their money. People who are looking for an exit to the current monetary system. The main advantages over gold being its decentralised and uncontrollable by nature, censorship resistant, publicly verifiable (as apposed to buying gold- which you just get a certificate of ownership). Stress tested and brand recognition makes it the most trusted crypto. Other cryptos will scale before bitcoin so It'll be interesting to see what happens over the next few years.

Fucken hell.

If you ask this question in this sub, of course all the answers will be yes. I suggest learning about about the currency first. Search up Andreas Antonopoulos on youtube, he has some of the best videos explaining why this tech is so revolutionary.

If you're feeling sad the price is going down, try not to check it so frequently. In the meantime, educate yourself on why this technology is so important. [Here]( is one of my favourite speeches about bitcoin.

I agree its a pretty bad depiction. Whoever made this had one attempt at creating a meaningful meme about the federal reserve and fucked it up big time. 
Nevertheless, the upvote % of this post is an interesting statistic about how people feel about the fed, even to the extent that they would upvote this lousy attempt at a fed reserve meme.

I second this. I get so frustrated when people are passive about their freedoms. I hope this post makes it to the top.

The upvotes aren't because this photo is an accurate depiction of banks. Its a reflection of people being fed up by privately owned banks who conceal their identity under a government label. The biggest monopoly of all time. A single entity that  controls the fate of the monetary supply acting upon decisions made behind closed doors. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Now **that** is the reason this post has 92% upvotes. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:12:17
I realise almost everyone will criticise something they don't understand. So many 'friends' call it a scam and yet they can't answer any questions on how or why it works (the tech, and the vision behind it).

"The paper also expressed fear that increased adoption of cryptocurrencies in Australia would dampen the efficacy of the RBA’s monetary policy operations." 
We dont give a fuck about your Reserve banks policies.

Precisely. This is exactly the reason we are in bitcoin. We, the people, want an exit to this corrupt system. A system where a single entity has primary oversight and control of the economic system. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Exactly. The moment they say their are big buyers coming in. You can bet your arse that they've already bought into the market. When they say investors aren't buying in, they're more than likely buying in now. 
Bitcoin has risen to a point where Institutional investors can no longer ignore it. They like money. Bitcoin has returned a % larger than any of their shit stocks and manipulated gold market and they want in.
