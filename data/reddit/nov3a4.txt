There will be options to make paper wallets. And other similar security options as any other wallets have currently. As well new added security with using of multi signature transactions. The way that to be able to send money you will need to sign transition from multiple devices. Hope it clarifies it.

EDIT2 (January 6 2014): I think seriously about starting development of MultiCoin wallet. Solving funding issue now. I think seriously about creation of funding project on bitcoinstarter.com or similar site to help with funding of this project.
Thinking whether it would not be good to create some introductory video to help with funding on bitcoinstarter.com or similar site to attract people and explain the features. Would somebody here who could help?
MultiCoin wallet is going to be open source project as was already written.

Yes, new on reddit. But I do not feel from alt coins like to be threat. They are on the same level. Some of them are even better/improved in some way. Providing different quality of crypto currency. That is good. Since monopoly always is not good. Innovations are always better than monopoly. The way if something is not optimal with one coin, improved coin can handle certain issues which are not optimal. One coin is good for this and other for another thing. Also current money system has various versions of currencies. I do not feel from alt coins as a threat but innovation, improvement and different view to Bitcoin. It would not be ok if other coins would not exist with improvements. Crypto currencies should help each other and free market should select freely which coin is the most preferred for certain things.
