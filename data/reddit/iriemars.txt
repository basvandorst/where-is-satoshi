Still can't understand why no bank offers crypto wallets for saving and storing. They can use it like they would a savings and the individual can trust their cryptos like they do their cash.

Sears? Kmart? I don't know what that is but what kind of coin are they offering?

Believe it or not that is the intent of most governments. Everyone working in the public sectors are public servants, this extends up to the highest office and down to the person delivering your mail. Somewhere along they way it was forgotten and in its place was the notion that somehow "they" know better and should and would decide for everyone else. Even worse now as... well one can go on.

Everyone is exhausted. Safer in fiat probably. Who fucking knows...

Can we change it to shit market? Cause we've been dropping like a turd for a while now.

They are really nice and cool about it. After your miss payment they should swing by your cardboard box behind the closed Radio Shack and hall it off for you at night while you sleep. Great team, customer service is  solid backing, and a website.

Seriously, why does it matter if a transaction is not truly pier to pier? As an end user as long as both parties get what they requested, goods/services for X coin, what does it matter to them if it hops from node to node? 
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:26:31
But look at the charts from ATH to now. You can't deny the resemblance.
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:26:46
The level of bearishness now is almost at the same level of bullishness during the run up to the ATH.... Thoughts?
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:38:41
If true, we are between anger and depression.

Selling at 2k is a better strategy than selling at 1K. But thats just me.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:00:59
Hope to be buying more.

Never seen this one. Rollercoaster meme 2.0 gets my approval. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:01:56
He ded.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:53:37
Looks like we are past Anger and past the previous low which would put us on the red. The question is now that we have gone the lowest since the ATH how low will it go before the suckers rally? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:07:29
Yup. I'll go ahead and PM you my addy now.

I thought Goku was BTC and Vegeta LTC? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:07:59
You've been saying this in other post too. Why are you still bumming around this sub if Bitcoin is dead? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:34:48
Looks like its going to bleed out now. No fork=no free coins?

It's really not that hard or expensive to get good coffee. He is right, they typically get their shit from central or south america cause its cheapest to import, whatever is readily available and at the cheapest prices. Then they will typically blend all the regions in and burn it to a fucking lump of coal. Grind it and serve it up to you. 
However, coffee places often times pride themselves on their offerings. One of the best ways to truly show off your collections of coffee is by displaying the country of origins and roasting the beans to the potential that brings out its most distinct flavors.  Typically, the lighter the roast, the more of its regional flavors are left intact, however, that doesnt mean a light roast is ideal for all beans. Maybe a Kona is best served at medium, or an Ethiopian yirgacheffe at a light. Central and south American beans are typically acidic and I personally don't like those. Kona is my go to, cheap and typically easy to find, blends of the kona aren't so bad. Good coffee overall. Blue mountain from Jamaica is expensive and overrated. But, this is the coffee that all other coffees are judge by. So when we say this coffee is smooth, rich, bold, acidic, it is compared to the blue mountain. Blue mountain is a standard I guess. 
There are also other unique coffees like the one where bats eat the coffee barrys and shit out the bean. There are tribs that follow these bats, collect the bean from the shit, roast, and serve. Last time I had this a single mug would run you $100. But I remember loving it and to this day I wish i would have savored it more.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:44:31
Stupid question. But where exactly is this free cash coming from? I don't get that split. Like if we start with $100 and split is it now $200? $100 per coin? Where exactly is the cash from the second coin coming from? I don't get that. It sounds like money is being printed or I'm just a dumb noob.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:50:48
I guess what I am asking is where is the fiat coming from? If BTC holds at $5k for example and the new coin is worth lets say $300 in fiat, Where Did that $300 come from? If the new coin drops to zero the second it goes live, who loses their investment? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:54:44
Noob here. Moved my small amount of BTC to a hardwallet. What is this node business and is it something I should do?
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:33:09
Noob here. How do you claim your "new" coin and sell it off?
@_date: 2019-09-11 02:29:06
Sucks ass. I don't have a atm card for a joint account so every time I need to pull money out the bank (not often) I have to get the manager to stick their finger in my ass to prove who I am despite having two forms of government ID.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:28:19
I miss the " wish BTC would drop so I can buy more" comments just a tad bit more.
@_date: 2018-07-21 17:05:21
I bought at $17k... Also at $15k, $9k, $6k, $4k, $300, you picking up what I'm putting down? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:16:27
Also a noob. I have a ledger and a small about of coins still on CB. What is the risk of leaving the coins there during the fork? I understand I need to move them onto my NanoS anyways. I also keep hearing about free BTC gold if you are holding BTC, hoe exactly does that work? How does one redeem those?
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:32:38
I think i had to do this bullshit for Kraken or Gemini. Kraken didn't work for shit at the time and Gemini denied my account without explanation despite several request to elaborate, so I basically bent over and gave them all my info and I got nothing in return. Big fuck you to both. 
I gave then my privacy and info for shit service or no service... This is why I'm upset... Just an FYI to clarify.
