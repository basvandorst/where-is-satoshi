...and all the free publicity he wants. not bad.

I doubt that ;-) that's a good prediction though

this is ponzi scheme talk guys. no one knows. there are issues with it that must be solved (low cost transfers), there are a number of competing coins which are quite usable regardless of what we think of the tech, governments could legislate against it, etc etc.
my opinion is that unless it can be used like fiat, it will ultimately fail. using it as a store of value is an interesting idea, but unless we all agree to it, it could all of a sudden be worth 0. static money dies. 
I'm also a bit concerned about the the 21 million total number of coins that can ever exist. 
so I'm optimistically sceptic about what the future holds for Bitcoin. right now there are a lot of infrastructural issues.

fees are pretty high  for small sums, but you can give less and it will still clear. maybe lightning �� will help, but I have yet to see an implementation.

just for kicks, what were the Greeks correct about?

mmm... I suggest you think about it some more. you seem to be blaming bad information (assuming you understood it well) and bad decisions on your part for the state you are in. then, from all that pile of garbage, you come up with a garbage conclusion.
having said that, harsh as it sounds, keep going and never stop learning.
trading �� is basically gambling. only Wall Street has a sure bet. it does it by stealing from the real economy since it controls politics and regulations.
btc may go up, but there are so many factors that can screw it up that it is also a gamble. best advice I've heard is to use BTC for real transactions for real goods. only then it may become what it promises to be.
so yeah, save some as an investment because it will probably go up in value, but also buy some just for spend and support it as a currency.

humans are social beings. a baby doesn't survive if not interacted with. stop drinking this bs coolaid about the selfish egotistical human unit it doesn't exist. and, you don't live in a game of thrones episode. 
that does not mean that we are not selfish or egotistical, but it's a complex dynamic process. it does not exist in a vacuum. by our very nature we need to be both selfish and altruistic at the same time, otherwise we couldn't exist.
the fact that we are writing on this board proves my point. if we didn't need each other we would not be sharing our thoughts.

�� �� �� there's certainly a lot of speculators and I wouldn't put a pumping move past them.

you make a very important point about spending Bitcoin. that's what will cement its place in human affairs as a medium of exchange. buy it, transfer it, do anything you would want to do with dollars (or whatever your local currency is). get paid directly in Bitcoin if your employer can do it.
