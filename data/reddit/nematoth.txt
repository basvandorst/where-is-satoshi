I'll hazard a wild guess and suggest maybe market forces? Bitcoin isn't making "progress", it's going backwards mate...

Yes.. Majority of Chinese use Korean exchanges.. Which one is the largest..? Bithumb..

Wellllll.... MtGox handled about 70% of all Bitcoin transactions at its peak.. (ie circa 2013)..

Sticking to their word? They've always had the option for both mate.

The quote from Craig Wright goes like this: "I was the main part of it, other people helped me". It's pretty clear from all the evidence that Satoshi Nakamoto is not a single person.

Yeah, but it'll still give the new app HUGE exposure on the crypto crazy Korean market..

I am in exactly the same position as you mate.. I made a withdrawal of 0.35 BTC almost two months ago now.. and have been ding donging with their support via facebook and web for the whole time. They keep saying it's been passed on to their compliance department, and then nothing. .zilch.. I write again.. "Akhil"  says I will personally attend to your matter.. blah blah blah.. again, nothing happens for days, weeks.. Really, really terrible customer support.

I don't see what the issue is here. If he believes that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin that's up to him. It's something that is based on opinion, and he's quite rightly entitled to his opinion. It's his website so he can do what he likes. He's put the ticker there, BCH. I own Bitcoin and I know what Bitcoin is , and the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. I am sorry, but if you are dumb enough to not know and/or research what you are buying then you shouldn't be spending your money on buying into Bitcoin in the first place.
