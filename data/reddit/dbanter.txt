If you do your accounting based on whether the inputs were spent, you have no problems.  But if you rely on transaction IDs to determine whether you made a payment, you're in for a rude awakening.
Wallets can get confused, but generally work correctly, sometimes in spite of themselves.  However, many wallets (including the Satoshi "reference" wallet, bitcoind) will allow you to spend "change" outputs before the original transaction gets confirmed, which can be a broken behavior if someone else resends the tx with a different hash (and that tx makes it into the blockchain instead of the original.)  This behavior can be considered "broken", but it is only broken in the presence of malicious actors.

You could check to see if one of the input transactions had been spent.  Since a given transaction output can only be spent exactly once ever, you can see if a transaction succeeded by seeing if any of the inputs are still available to spend.

If you compare Bitcoin to writing a check, there's a source account number [transaction], a destination name [address], and an amount.  There's a signature on the check to actually authorize the withdrawal.  There's also a check number [transaction ID] you can use to reconcile your account.
There's a ~flaw in the Bitcoin protocol where you can photocopy the check for deposit, but have a different check number.  If someone gets their photocopy to the bank first, then that check is honored instead of the original, but only one check will ever clear [make it into the blockchain.]  If you do all your reconciliation based on check number, you might think funds haven't cleared even though they did.
People are abusing that fact to make multiple withdrawals if the funding party doesn't check to see if the original funds are spent before sending new funds.
ELI15: In Bitcoin, you don't spend actual coins, you spend earlier transactions that gave you coins.  You should always check to see if the source transactions were spent, instead of relying on the transaction id.

Part of the problem with tracking balances in Bitcoin is that there are just so *many* of them.  Pretty much every time you spend bitcoins you create a new transaction output to a new address that must have its balance checked.  Also; there's a mind shift.  It's easy to think of addresses as having balances, but really it's the (unspent) transaction outputs to that address that actually have balances.
FYI A Bitcoin transaction completely consumes the balance of one or more input transactions, and sends **all** of those funds to one or more output addresses.  Usually there are two output addresses: one for the payee, and another address created just so you can send your change back to yourself.  Any funds in the transaction that are left unspent go to miners.
When you see people saying that Gox should have cancelled the initial transactions by respending the inputs, it's because the Bitcoin network will only ever allow a given transaction output to be spent once.  And once you've broadcast a transaction, even if it never gets mined into the blockchain, there's still the potential for that transaction to somehow get validated/repaired and spent.  So (to borrow my earlier metaphor) the only way to cancel a check is to respend one or more of the inputs from the to-be-cancelled check using another check.  Once the new check clears (into the blockchain), there's no longer any possibility for the old check to do the same.

Spent in this case is "made it into a block."  If you're going to issue a refund send the bitcoin in a new transaction, you first must craft a transaction that sends some part of the original transaction to yourself and wait for that to get into a block.
Any given transaction output can only be spent once; if your "respend" transaction makes it into a block, then the other (original) transaction is no longer viable.

@_date: 2014-02-10 16:14:32
TL;DR The Bitcoin protocol is actually quite complex in order to handle a lot of potential edge/abuse cases, and Gox didn't necessarily implement the protocol entirely correctly.   Delays (and other shenanigans) ensued!
Suggestions of payment problems being caused by insolvency may be better explained by payment problems caused by bugs in their Bitcoin protocol implementation.
[Personal note: Not sure which way Occum's Razor would go on this one.] 
Edit / alternate TL;DR: Looks like Gox was broadcasting malformed transactions, and sometimes people would fix the bad transaction and rebroadcast it with a new transaction id; Gox's software didn't recognize that the coins were spent since the initial tx failed; now they have a mess to clean up because their ledger doesn't match the blockchain's.
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:11:40
What people are calling a "transaction ID" is actually a transaction hash.  If you change something minor about the encoding of the transaction (even without actually changing the underlying transaction details) then you (by definition) wind up with a different cryptographic hash.
The thing is, that hash is what's used later to spend the resulting bitcoins.  If you spend some coins (sending the "change" back to an address you've created and control), and before the transaction is confirmed, try to spend some of that change, that transaction may fail if someone re-wraps your transaction in a way that generates a new txid, and that transaction gets confirmed before your original one.  Your follow-up tx can't be valid because the txid you've spent from didn't make it into the blockchain.

You don't have to use the localbitcoins escrow service to do transactions on localbitcoins.  (Last time I sold BTC I found a buyer via localbitcoins, but did the BTC transfer directly.  The buyer asked me to sit around and chat for a bit until a couple of confirmations came in, which is reasonable.  Guess what we chatted about?)

Money is just a way to reduce the friction inherent in barter.  "Money" is always a social construct.  Trying to figure out the objective "reason" for "why money has value" is time wasted on a false premise.  Instead, seek understanding around "why people ascribe value to money."
I feel like a lot of talking head economists fail at two fundamental understandings.  What I outlined above, and the idea that Bitcoin is both a unit of currency and a transaction network, and neither side of the coin (pun!) has any particular value to society without the other.

I think that one fundamental epiphany to understanding the value of Bitcoin is to recognize that "Bitcoin" means two things: Bitcoin the unit of account, and Bitcoin the network.  Without the network backing the unit of account, there's not much to talk about.  But once you consider the network's ~instantaneous, international, non-repudiable, ~free commercial and personal payments (remittances!), with no counterparty risk, and eyebrows start climbing off of foreheads.

Personal Bitcoin security will become a Huge issue for people, esp. the non-tech-savvy.  And if you store substantial amounts of BTC with a third party (eg wallet service,) that only means you haven't been paying attention.
I've had a poor run of luck with third party services in the BTC space.  ...Well, I used to think it was bad luck, but in hindsight I think it might have been more like poor judgement in trusting anyone else with my BTC.

When I've done in-person Bitcoin transfers, both parties have had smartphones.  LocalBitcoins can send transfer confirmations via SMS (if their SMS gateway works in your country), so you don't need an Android phone if you use their service.
It works like this: 
The seller transfers their BTC to localbitcoins before the in-person cash transaction takes place.
Once you meet in-person, the seller notifies localbitcoins via sms (or phone browser) that they've received the cash
localbitcoins transfers the btc to your localbitcoins account and SMS'es you the (secret) code that tells you that the transfer is complete
you should then withdraw your BTC from localbitcoins to a device or paper wallet you control.

Short answer: the price would go up before that happened.
Longer: The exchanges own none of the Bitcoin traded on them; it's just a forum for people who own Bitcoin and people who own (eg) USD to trade one for the other.  If there's a shortage of Bitcoin the the price goes up; if more people who hold Bitcoin instead want USD, the price goes down.  The current price defines the equilibrium point between those opposing forces.

There are a number of cryptographically strong hashing functions peer to SHA-256.

You're not risking more just because BTC went to $1000.  The risk has always been that it might go to zero.  $100 in newly acquired BTC going to zero then is the same as $100 in newly acquired BTC going to zero now.

Enough people have covered the upside-- the main downsides are the direct and opportunity costs involved in paying your developer to do the Coinbase integration work, instead of working on other projects.  (These costs are non-zero, therefore integration has a downside.)  Looking at the Coinbase API dev guide (as a dev m'self), it looks like it uses a button and callback system that's VERY similar to how PayPal works, so if you're already accepting PayPal, your dev should be able to repurpose that existing code with a few edits.

While this is nominally true, and there will likely be a fork in this scenario where solo miners continue an alternate blockchain with a small percentage of the network hashing power, the pool operators control which chain is actually resistant to a 51% attack.

For all practical purposes, if all of the pool operators agree, everyone else will come along.

I'm afraid you're only spreading ignorance.

As an actual customer of Butterfly Labs, I can say that they seriously need to work on improving their delivery/promises ratio, but in my experience they do (eventually) actually ship what's been ordered.

My point is that the current byzantine regulatory framework doesn't just have the *potential* for shipping American ideas and jobs overseas, but that it is *already happening.*
If there were federal-level clarity about what rules and regs must be followed, and an explicit wall preventing one state from extending its legal dominion onto businesses in other states, that would be a huge step forward.

"Bitcoin is a global person-to-person digital currency that works on the Internet.  It allows transfers of any amount from anyone, to anyone, at any time, near-instantly, with negligible fees, and no third-party (government or bank or corporation) control.  Bitcoin is like digital cash: transactions can not be reversed, as there is no central authority to adjudicate disputes.  The Bitcoin network has been working since 2009 and is just starting to get mainstream attention."
