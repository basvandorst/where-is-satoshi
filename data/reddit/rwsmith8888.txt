They are also requiring addresses of payees before you can get a cashier's check.

why is bitcoin use making him tired?
@_date: 2014-05-01 14:36:05
true, i guess my real complaint is re entering all the drafts based upon the old card number.

I know, I am conflicted regarding buying more bitcoin now as the price has run up so quickly BUT if speculation that the other sealed indictments include current and former politicians of high stature is true (even if they aren't for the crimes you described), it will rock everyone's confidence in the entire artifice.

thanks, i did the port forwarding but still can't get past the 8 connections so it must be filtered at the firewall too. I will keep digging.

search 8333 in this sub

Hi: Can someone help me please as I have port forwarded but still only have 8 connections ( I had one or two before port forwarding). Xfinity support keeps telling me to port forward. I think it is more complicated with Xfinity but don't see help online.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:43:32
that is actually the minimum to run your own wallet but it appears that it doesn't allow seeding or supporting the network in general...

I was proud of my node after I was able to forward port 8333 which allowed the 8 connections  but damn now I find out I am hurting the network. I can't seem to navigate opening the port. Is that the DMZ setting? edit: i have xfinity
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:34:32
Thanks, i didn't realize that was allowed. Maybe that would allow me to control the port opening more easily as well.

Instead of MERS or a DERS as gatekeeper deeds/mortgages of public record where the entity is the nominee maybe the gatekeeper deed/mortgage could just be conveyances to 'bitcoin user address X' then you could simply refer to the block chain to determine ownership going forward?
Each property could have two colored coins, one for the deed and one for a mortgage and if you didn't owe money, you would simply also own the colored coin representing the mortgage?
Thank you but please stop playing along when you are bored as I could go on forever as this is very interesting to me. haha

Interesting but isn't mers a nominee for the lenders? How would an off record owner get a prior on record owner to convey to him to say, evict a tenant?

Hi: Wouldn't the laws of the jurisdiction in which the property is located have to change to recognize the validity of the transfer on the block chain as opposed to the transfer in the current public record? Is there any model legislation yet?
