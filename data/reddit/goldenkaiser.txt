The difference is- fuck it look up how many institutions buy/sell gold compared to bitcoin. I'm tired of pointing out simple shit to people on this subreddit. 
And precious metals are not at all manipulated, look up basic laws of supply and demand and then do some research as to how much gold is known to exist. Then you can probably deduce it's not all that manipulated.

Sorry, does this come as a surprise? Bitcoin discussion in this subreddit is more closely linked with economics/business then it is with technology- as someone who is genuinely interested in technology, I'm interested in actual hardware or quality advancements, not the fucking price of bitcoin for the 3rd time today. I mean, you don't see people posting the price of the USD/Gold in there either? Zynga accepting bitcoin has nothing to do with technology, but with business, so take it to an appropriate subreddit. If someone posts something about the specs of a new bitcoin mining system with some technological facts behind it, that make it remotely related to the subreddit, it's a different story however. Additionally, it should motivate everyone to stop this incest pool of a subreddit and take a more serious direction for it.

I'm not saying the anarchistic way is the closed minded one, however the way you are approaching this argument is entirely wrong. Anarchism in itself is a political view point, however by default, they are then concerning themselves with politics; it is up to you to be ignorant or radical in your ideas. Simply put, taxation is never an easy question, however I do believe you do need a fundamental understanding in economics before you can just say to devil with taxation. You're taking a shitload for granted when you say taxation is theft- I did mention infrastructure and education in a previous post, which without tax money would be nowhere close to the levels the United States has now. Now you can call me a liar, or that I'm making this up, however where would the money come from otherwise? Who would have an incentive to build a road? A highway? To open a school? Unless your suggesting that we leave this to the free market (which is capitalism), you simply don't understand the barter system on which every economy nowadays is based. No one would have built roads, opened public schools, etc. just in the name of being a good person; people work off incentives. 
I can see where your belief ties in with bitcoin, however if your viewpoint on taxation is so harsh, how on earth do you still support bitcoin? Everywhere bitcoin is accepted, tax is slapped on. Whether or not it is Dell (I'm assuming your username has to do with the recent news that Dell accepts bitcoin) or some small franchise accepting bitcoin, they in the end charge you the (convertible) amount in USD, inclusive of taxes.

They would sell if bitcoin tanks. Undeniably, they haven't done anything to come together to get the word out in a professional manner (as they don't care about bitcoin, they see it as a commodity). I think your problem is that you don't see the disassociation that bitcoin has- there is you, the activist and grass root movements guy, which makes up a fraction of the actual btc held, and then there is the guy looking to make money off the commodity bitcoin- which makes up a large percentile. That is the guy you are driving away from bitcoin through guerilla marketing, and also the guy who doesn't give to shits about the leftist agenda of about 99% of the bitcoiners on here.
@_date: 2014-03-14 12:49:20
I bet a lot of are looking at that retail column thinking bitcoin is unbeatable. Don't forget that bitcoin is a virtual currency and most likely won't find as much foothold as a (tangible)real currency. In other words, those unrealized savings on the left side, are close to unreachable. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:56:01
You can define it how you want, but that's a very biased description ;) I still find it funny arguing against someone who says taxes are the devil; you sure take a lot for granted. The time old question I ask you, what is the better alternative? How else do we pay for public schools, roads and police? 
@_date: 2014-07-27 14:00:12
Considering no one definitively knows who Satoshi is, how can you say no one has insider knowledge? Did Gox not have insider infos they chose not to release? I think you'd be naive to simply ignore such happenings, and write it off that btc is not a company. Companies work off of btc (the ones you interface with at exchanges etc.) and they might have insider knowledge.

@_date: 2014-07-27 11:03:34
With a total market cap of 7.7 billion, moving several 'statistically insignificant' amounts of millions has a profound effect (especially when its done sustained, as you pointed out this has been happening for 9 months). If the founder of a big company slowly starts selling off millions and millions of his own shares in his own company, doesn't that make investors a little weary? Or is that good for investing, because it frees up more shares?
@_date: 2014-07-27 10:42:35

You seem to really hold on to that belief that bitcoin will one day reach 10k. I'll just leave you with that thought and let you live your dream, but if you come up with a creditable point as to why bitcoin is expected to reach that, (beyond the typical oh well look at the numbers this article says) please do tell me why this was a great low risk investment. (with reference to the 50% you have lost on it so far) 
@_date: 2014-07-29 10:27:37
Besides you constantly questioning my ability to understand, I don't see the point your making. The morality of the taxman knocking on your door, is because the money is then used to provide public goods and services, which help build the country. You are free to go to a country where the taxman doesn't knock on your door, and you aren't forced to pay taxes, but your top prospects are probably western africa, somalia or sierra leone.

And don't think that because they have mobile phones that they spend all day on reddit dreaming of the freedom that bitcoin brings; they don't, they have no fucking clue how it works.
You realise that to utilize bitcoin efficiently they would have to be able to provide proper infrastructure to interact with it. And little/no computers means little utilization of bitcoin.

Taking into consideration that was joepie91's first comment on this thread, he didn't take a side of the argument, only pointed out a fallacy. In terms of yousmokecrackrocks initial reply, he is simply referring to the fact that most bitcoiners tend to take a very very liberal, if not communist stance to most things corporations, something not only he notices. While he does make a generalisation, it doesn't draw away from the point at hand- if you fundamentally disagree with governments, capitalism, or corporations for that matter; you have bigger problems then trying to get people to adopt bitcoin. The initial point that guerilla marketing draws people away from bitcoin is serious. Consider that for mass adoption to start happening, you rely on the professionals and corporations- why would any one be convinced of bitcoin with a shitty little post-it defacement over a perfectly legitimate and paid ad? If bitcoin is so great, why can't it pay for this legitimate ad?

I was simply point out that by that logic initially presented, we would be no where. If we all worked, because something *might* be handy in the future (when more people use bitcoin/its worth more/etc) we would do a lot of work based on speculation (I might need a blog later / there might be a gold vein under my house). That doesn't draw away from having a greater vision, but serious market research needs to be done prior; not wishful thinking that the population will adopt bitcoin, because we are shoving it down their throats. The point that I'm making was more tying into the initial post, that there is no point for to start bombarding poor sarah that they want bitcoin donations, when in the end maybe 10 people will donate a total of 10$. 


If that person goes on to donate equal to the amount put in by imgur to accept bitcoin (time is money), then yes, it would be worth the effort for imgur.


I sincerely hope people just come to reason; yes maybe the future is a crypto currency, however not with bitcoins initial flaws and to the moon attitude (It's going to be worth 10k soon etc etc) presented by a large portion of the community on A large portion uses it to purport a leftist agenda (avoiding taxes/we hate taxes/yadada) which is also stopping people *like me* from thinking this is the future. Additionally, I'm still at awe how people can actually think that this currency is the future when a large portion of btc is held by a person unknown (Satoshi and other very early adopters). Not only does it artificially inflate the price, it also gives him a quick exit option where he can sell his bitcoin off quickly, eventually sending btc prices into a downward spiral crashing (making people lose a lot of money)- I'm not making this up, the first block chains were all mined before the majority of the btc population ever even heard of bitcoin. As long as there is so much unknown information surrounding it, it could just be an elaborate scheme to get money. Just because a lot of people are thinking this is the future, and a lot of people are becoming blind with the thought of having money, doesn't mean bitcoin WILL become successful/stable/the future.
Just my two cents; I realise a lot of the people on here have a high stake in bitcoin (why people do this I don't know), which is why criticism isn't well handled in this community. However, I don't care voicing my opinion in exchange for having a couple of negative karma points ;)

The money for advertising is there, only the people that hold it aren't concern for bitcoins well being, they are concerned for their investment. Hence, why no unified entity works towards creating ad campaigns. Considering bitcoin is supposed to be the fore front of technology, and the new era of digital commerce, I'm forced to asked why it has to resort to guerilla marketing. Imagine you are a guy whos heard just a bit about bitcoin, and the first thing other than some articles you read about it, is a shitty post it note- is that how the new era of currency looks?
It's about image, and defacing a paid advertisement to support your cause, isn't given bitcoin a positive image, simple as.

So instead of diversifying your investments like a sane person (which you did to some extent) you chose to invest your wealth in a pilot project? Either you made it on the black market and have no where else to go, or you need to invest a couple of those shiny euros in risk management and portfolio diversification. You even said in your post that btc is addicting like drugs; obviously the junkie will think its good to spend all his money on drugs, however only as a bystander can you say that's absolutely retarded.

The point to that is, that at this point, any reasonable person will already know of bitcoin unless they are living under a rock. I gather the post-it is in some NYC subway, and you'd be hardpressed to find people who haven't at least heard of it. So I feel like pretty much anything guerilla related portrays a negative image.

No argument you just gave, gives me reason to believe that bitcoin is a better alternative. Before you start talking about stolen credit card usage- what about paying with stolen bitcoin? There is pretty much no way to see who stole it, and if they spend it the owner of the shop doesn't even know that the bitcoin was stolen in the first place. A very fair and safe system. 
10 mins average (over 15) isn't that big of a difference, it's still much longer than ccs take.

I know the struggle; however you have to account that most people don't know the strict rules of debate, nor are they too concerned with fallacies. Try to convince using other forms of argument, as pointing out flaws in their meta-debating tends only to infuriate people even further, or start going off on a tangent about something else. 
If you are able to point and spot fallacies (which I completely agree you did earlier), you must also have the intellectual ability to convince him, or at least provide a counter argument which portrays your view point.

So you'd happily invest in a bond with fundamental problems such as the 51%? 
A lot of this subreddit is defined by the phrase "lets pretend 1btc will be worth $xxxk in x amount of years," you're basing a lot of your investment strategy on a very very big assumption; no investment/bond goes from 600$ a share to 100k$ a share. So here is your problem- is btc an investment or a currency? You're playing two distinctive games here and choosing to play by the rules that best suit your argument, judging by your responses in this thread.

Again 51%. How can you be sure that your value is actually there? It involves trusting the government just as it involves trusting gox to actually have your btc when you want to send / withdraw them. It could be gox or any other exchange. And if history of btc taught us anything, how can you be skeptical of the government but not your investing peers? They are just as likely to lie to you for their own good as the government is for theirs.

Was going to say this as a rebuttal, kind of. If the power went out today, I'd be poor until those darn greedy power organisations would turn my power back on; but I can't pay my power bill because I have to pay with bitcoin. And without power I can't pay with bitcoin.
Alternatively, if the power went off while I was trying to use facebook, I'd go outside, meet a female and buy her a coffee with my fiat money.

Your subtracting the fact that bitcoin has a market cap of 7.7 billion. If someone were to screw with enough BTC's he could send the entire market crashing; the same is not true with the USD as no one person could send my entire net worth crumbling.

No, a gift card is a loan you give (temporarily) to a business, on the assumption they have the product you want some where down the line in exchange. With gift cards, they treat that money you gave them on purchasing as capital, just like you give the bank your money as capital.
At that point (until you withdraw funds, or purchase a product) you are loaning to companies to the same extent you are loaning to banks when you deposit. (with the assumption your product is there when you want/need it)
You are not prebuying anything, as the money from giftcards doesn't go into a seperate 'gift card' fund, instead its treated just like any other sale.  They are treated like credit cards, and protected as such.
[This]( article goes to explain that point.
So no, by the 'going' definition, gift cards are fraud.

A pile of cash under my mattress is probably the most sound strategy of keeping money possible, simply because the USD eco system is big enough for me not to have to care whether or not a big player screws up. Bitcoin on the other hand, and from what I got from inferring your prior posts; just because one guy (who owns this much btc) loses or messes up his keys, and some unknown user gains access- he could essentially run and cash out, causing the btc to lose value (selling this many bitcoins would have a huge repercussion on price). 
You should take a look at risk management before telling other people they 'pollute' the discussion. You pretty much argued your own point.

I'm totally down for investing in something (I haven't heard of until that point) with real money, when the only way I've heard about it was through post-its! 
Thats totally sarcastic, I have to disagree with you. If your goal is to bring users to the eco system, you need serious and professional persuasion, called advertisement. Me already knowing about bitcoin, makes it look even more humbug- why would I be enticed to give money to something, or believe in something, when all they can do is post shitty little post-its all over the subway, making it look like shit? Firstly, most people don't bat their eye twice at defacement. Secondly, if you need to attract users through post it notes on subways, you need to rethink your advertisement strategy. 
And lastly, take into consideration if every entity/company felt it necessary to guerilla market by sticking post its onto the subway. All of a sudden, it becomes destructive advertisement, as people will be annoyed by the defacement.

Karpeles represented just how easily bitcoin is to fool. I was using him as an anecdote for the negative potential of bitcoin, and how easy it can be abused.
Just a question, with things like the 51% problem how do you so easily write off the gold standard as milky and non-verifiable? (51% provides the opportunity for just that)
I don't see how it makes me full of misconceptions because I am questioning your motives of taking bitcoin with all its flaws and money grabbing community as a better alternative to pegging a currency to an actual value? Exactly how is a dollar which is backed by the equivalent worth in gold a worse principle than trusting a bitcoin which is worth nothing in return?
I realise why the gold standard was dropped, but its not the reasons you are claiming.

This differs from how banks are supposed to work now how?
Assuming banks don't misuse the funds they are given, they perpetually work (as with lots of banks). If they however did make such grave errors, how am I not losing more money more frequently from my bank?
Of course it boils down to who you trust, however most serious banks will have stringent rules for loans (so that you will be able to repay them), and also have enough capital to cover my withdraws. 
Also, the money in my bank isn't dependent on someone else repaying my loan, its the responsibility of my bank to have the money when I want it; if one day the atm didn't want to give me money, would I go after the guy who didn't repay his loan or the bank which is legally obliged to protect my money? Same answer as with the giftcard, its all on them.

So I'm debating against an anarchist here? You seem to be taking a lot for granted. Your government (probably) gave you education so you can read and write, they built your roads, built the infrastructure for the very platform your debating on here. Politics is and will be filled with what you consider idiots, simply because that's how the government works. You don't agree with every Americans opinion so how could you possibly be in agreeance with the entire government? That's how democracy works. You turning a blind eye is a typical example of ignorance and the kind of attitude in which bad things breed; case and point, during the initial rise to power the nsdap won the vote but only 36% of the population voted. So was every German a nazi? No, they were just ignorant towards politics, and bad things happened. 
Just remember it's always easy to say politics is a bunch of shit when they reach a decision not in line with your belief, but you never really think about all the decisions they do reach that are in line with your views.

Arguing definitions has nothing to do with it. Ideologies and politic in this context are very similar. 
Let me get one point to you- something you should look up- Social Contract. Whether you accept it or not, to be a living part of society, as you are born you sign an invisible 'social contract.' This contract varies greatly from country to country, but what it boils down to is the question between liberty and security. That's the only question governments ever face- how do we give our people enough freedom to/from and how do we provide security to/from? The social contract is then the formulation through thousands of hours of debates and policies, what it is exactly you are free to do; equally and oppositely, in exchange to having all these freedoms/infrastructures/laws (and a police force, which is *meant* to protect you) you have to abide by the laws set forth by the government. Now, you can go off crying that its unfair, but I can provide a plentiful list of countries where the government doesn't 'oppress', and topping that would probably a country like Somalia.
Pacifism has nothing to do with it; only know that if you want to be an active part of society, you also have to play by the rules that govern it. Anything other than that, would be double standards. Which I don't question you have.

C) If Qualcomm tries to take any sort of fee/royalty for the transactions, many cartel agencies would not allow this, as they can't force a technology onto a consumer and then also take a cut every time they have to use it.

Seriously I'm wondering. Your hawking on how this guy supports a scam for no good reason when you can't explain where 1 million of your scam currently is nor who even started it. Can you give one rational argument or just outright deny and classify?

a) OP mentioned frequently that he is also a user of bitcoin, which entitles him to post in this subreddit.
b) Whether you like it or not, Dogecoin has just as much validity in the CC space as bitcoin does; being the original gives it no claim to be the only. 
c) OP was posting suggestions of how dogecoin and btc could start working together, without trying to start an argument of whether or not you support his CC or not.
d) You have not contributed *at all* to any form of discussion, and only have peddled your (very narrow) opinions, without backing or supporting your reasoning to **anything** you said.
With that in mind, I believe you are the one trolling and spamming.
Think again what is really the cancer of this community.

Let me line out exactly what went down, you seem to have trouble remembering:
OP came into this subreddit to promote co-operation between the Dogecoin and Bitcoin community and to remove some of the friction between the two communities- why there is friction in the first place, is 99% because of pride and 1% of the baseless opinions of people like you post and somehow find traction in peoples minds.
By the criteria that you evaluate dogecoin as a scam, one could also draw the premise that btc is a scam; the same underlying technology, some but not much product differentiation; maybe it has the biggest community- however if history has taught us anything, the majority isn't always right. I'm not claiming dogecoin is, but you have no right to dismiss his CC as scam when yours relies on the same fundamental principle.
*Then* OP asks you why his is considered a scam, when your CC has 1 million units hidden away belonging to someone no one knows the identity of. 
I really am not trying to denounce bitcoin, but if you want a healthy discussion you can at least argue properly and not just blindly come up with bullshit and baseless assumptions; no where have you been able to provide any proof/evidence/logic of how you arrived at any of the claims you made. Thereby, all you are really doing is pointlessly spamming the comment section with baseless hate towards another CC.

The average consumer however doesn't evaluate business models. They want return on their investments or a secure and easy way to handle their money/coins. You cant expect everyone to be an insider like the assumption is here, for this to have any chance of mass adoption.

The statistic you make is totally irrelevant also- Paypal is a closed source payment processing platform, whereas Bitcoin is a kind of open network/currency -- 2 totally different things categorically, so this whole repo growth thing doesn't at all provide a valid reason to invest/buy into bitcoins.

How about an overview of total repos created for each?
