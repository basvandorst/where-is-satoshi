Again, I don't think it wasn't an issue with the blockchain. In fact, it likely was not. I can pm you a screen shot of the account as it sits if my multibit will load it again. What I think it was had to do with the cheer number of bets+double spends+unconfirmed txs. Again, I'm not very familiar with it all. All I know is that it had my "Balance" at one number, and my spendable at another. The spendable would update as the blockchain confirmed the txs. The Balance was astronomically high howver so I assumed that it would, in the end, all become spendable once I let it sit after not making any transactions for a while. I was wrong.
As for a troll, no sir, however I'm wary of anything someone on the internet says so I can't fault you for that.
And if it were a psychological issue, it would be pathological gambling, though in my case "major" might be a little heavy. The DSMIV states that you must have three or more of the these symptoms for at least a year:
1. Tolerance ( needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money)
2. Withdrawal (is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or
stop gambling; gambles as a way of escaping from problems or a
dysphoric mood)
3. Larger amounts ( After losing money gambling, often returns
another day to get even-”chasing”)
4. Impaired control- ( has repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut
back or stop gambling)
5. Time spent- ( Is preoccupied with gambling) 
6. Neglect of activities-(has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job or career
opportunity because of gambling)
7. Continued use despite problems- ( Lies to family members or others
to conceal the extent of gambling. Has committed illegal acts to
finance gambling; Relies on others to provide money to relieve a
desperate financial situation caused by gambling) 
The dsm 5 may have changed some of these but this was my first and only issue with problem gambling if you could call it that.

I added a few more and posted the screenshot. If you can figure out why my multibit is STILL showing a different balance, more power to you. I simply don't have enough experience with this stuff to make a definitive conclusion. All I can do is guess. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:59:16
I wrote this because after spending almost 24 hours sleepless and in the dark I started googling gambling issues and help. I came across a lot of articles that encouraged accepting responsibility and the like. My university offers counseling (from psychologists) on campus and I just made an appointment online to talk someone about just that. Thank you for the advice.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:53:24
Yes, this exactly. In fact, my client still shows completely incorrect balances (even after "resetting"/synchronizing with the blockchain). I posted a screenshot yesterday of what my some of my balances look like even though they are quite empty. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:55:01
I don't really have enough knowledge on the subject to give a decent assumption so I'll just ask: Do you mean that the attacker targeted gambling sites in general? Or targeted me? I think I'm a serious small fry to be going after if that's the case...
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:53:12


Shit, sorry about that. I ended up posting the addresses a couple times and forgot to add to the message.


I wouldn't even know where to begin with that. What subreddit do you recommend? At this point it just crashes while "resetting" the blockchain unless I move the .wallet files out. When I try to grab "open" them it just freezes up again.  
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:44:09
YOU. You've commented on a lot here. I keep meaning to reply. Sorry it took me this long. You're awesome. Thank you for being positive and giving me a bit to think about. Whether or not people here or IRL commend you for it, you're doing a good thing and it has impacted at least me. I hope you're not secretly a scumbag. But even if you are, your words helped. Thank you 
@_date: 2014-02-16 09:10:14
Thank you. I don't believe I have a gambling addiction, however, I will be seeing a counselor on monday to talk about how this have affected me and how it all made me feel.
I can pretty certainly say I'm not interested in any kind of gambling. A really bad experience will do that to me. Again, I'll be cautious with my state of mind and consider what you've said. Thank you!!!
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:45:11
I think it was a combination of the Multibit client, the failed transactions, the double spends, and the malleability. 
If I look at my multibit wallet right now it still says I have 2btc when, in fact, I have nothing.
However you're right that in most cases it showed many exact doubles of ins and outs. But, along the way, instead of doubles of boths the ins and outs, it was more of just the received btc. 
As it is Multibit still crashes on me when I try to synchronize the wallet. It gets to about 45% then bogs down my resources and becomes unresponsive.
(Again, I want to stress that I don't believe it was multibit's fault for this. I should have known better.)
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:18:35
I'm doing my best to keep my head up. It is hard not to become consumed by the negativity of the situation. I keep going back and forth being optimistic to realize the situation is only going to get harder for now. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:57:03
I think you're mistaking what I'm trying to say.
My available spendable balance was correct, however the overall balance was not. I didn't say that it was allowing me to spend the unconfirmed outputs. It was not showing me the correct overall balance so, through that, I believed I had more than was actually available to me.
As for denial or major psychological issues, the TM affected the way Bitcoin-QT, Electrum, and Multibit were displaying my balance. Even my blockchain.info account was out of step for a little while. I wasn't hallucinating the transactions. There were doubles of most but some of them must have only been showing doubles of INCOMING and not just doubles of both bet out and winnings in. 
I'll PM you a screen shot of the wallet info and you can make your own judgement. Or I'll ask a mod if they care enough.
Edit: PMed. That's one of the accounts that I was using at the time.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:12:10
Thank you I really appreciate that. I'll try to bank on better decisions or hope for better situations in the future.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:58:49
I specifically said I don't want anyone to give me anything. I posted the transactions and addresses because people were asking for proof of the situation. So I added the the transaction ids, addresses, and screen shots of the information. I don't think anyone will give me anything nor do I want them to. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:15:13
Winners and losers. That's really what life delves out. You ended with a bang there, so to speak (sorry), but you're clearly aware of what people are capable of. You're clearly aware you can make millions by chance or a stroke of decent risk taking and lose it all by impulsion, greed, or silly minuscule mistakes. My story pales in comparison to yours. My story is a drop in the bucket when sat side by side. My story is just a shit way to feel better about my own bad decision. And honestly, my story can't even reach out to touch the pain you must have felt over the last year nor can it even convey the hatred you must feel.
All that being said you must have a great amount of strength to even *drag* yourself this far. To be looking over reddit and see a post so similar to your own situation, even if it is just dust in comparison, and offer some seriously meaningful amount of perspective to someone like me. Someone like me who, for a relatively small amount, thought he wouldn't make it anywhere because of his greed and blunder. 
Well, shit, man... I see your story and I feel like I'm no where near the amount of anguish I could be in. That my fuck up, even though it will cause me to struggle like I've never before, is nothing compared to others in similar situations.  
In that, you've given me a WHOLE new perspective. A lot of the people here have said things to make me think hard about my decisions both past and for the future. You, however, have given me a gift of "it could be so, so much worse."
I don't know what the fuck to tell you in the long run, honestly. Whether you'll listen or take me seriously or are a troll, I don't know. But I don't really care. I'll say a few things anyways:
Don't shoot yourself. Seriously, it's messy, people have to clean it up and whether or not you believe it it will affect people that you haven't even considered. Even if you've pushed away everyone you love and everyone who loves you, it's fucked up thing to do. I had realize that myself, though again the situation pales in comparison. 
On top of all of that, you've already proven useful in some aspect. Here and now you have me a positive outlook on my situation. Your situation isn't worthless, at the very least. 
Just point something out.... you're on reddit, too. Look at all the shit people accomplish. Daily. Hourly. Do that. Don't waste the life you have. Look at it differently. Also, everyone loves when people start their stories from " I was a drug addiction who lost millions and here I am now..." You're one of those success stories waiting to happen if you get your shit together and find another passion. 
Let's be cliche together. You can do it. 
Edit: I made a bad joke. I'll leave it but I really was only trying to liven up the seriously morbid situation. Bad taste.
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:22:16
I was in the shower and came up with just that synopsis of the situation a little bit ago. I've paid 7 grand and some future struggle to learn a daunting lesson of bad choices. I don't think I'll ever run head long into an investment like this again. Thanks for the words man, I appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:06:41
Can it affect me negatively to start posting my addresses? I can send you a screenshot of Multibit and the balance it is showing. I didn't think to take screenshots at the time it was happening however. I didn't know there was an issue other than the transactions taking a while to show. Then I realized the overall balance was widely incorrect in comparison to the SPENDABLE (read: actual) balance. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:28:58
Thank you. You're right, I have plenty of time ahead of me. I should start with working on my foresight for just that; obviously it isn't the end of the world. That was just the rumination on the shitty situation talking through me. 
Reading what everyone here has been saying has seriously cleared my head. I can do it even if I struggle for a little while. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:52:24
Dude, I hate to say it, but this is just not the way to go about it. You're just begging. Begging never gets anyone anywhere. Look at my post history, I made bad decisions coupled with shitty timing. Lost everything I had. Still coping with it. Will still be coping with it for many months to come. 
Do something other than begging and you might get somewhere.
@_date: 2014-02-16 09:16:59
Well, I wasn't paying much attention to it all. But what I do know is that the "wins" began to trickle in as opposed to the normal 5-15 minute turn around. I posted a few other explanations as well as an imgur link to how my Multibit account is *still* showing incorrect balances for all of my wallets despite being "Online" and up to date.
Basically, what appears to have happened is that my overall balance was showing incorrectly leading me to believe I had upwards of 30 BTC. So, I gambled on the knowledge that I had 30btc. It turned out that this was not the case and my overall balance was astronomically wrong. 
I'm not sure if I missed anything with that explanation but, the short version is, durning the TM *thing* my balance on Mulitbit led me to believe I had much more than I must have actually had. In fact, it still shows I have 3 or 4 BTC when in reality I have NONE!
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:34:44
I think one of the biggest factors of pissing it all away was because in the past I had chips in my hand or quarters to sift through and watch them dwindle. Or at the very least I had to walk over and stick cash in a machine that would spit out a card. Essentially I was fully aware of how much I was spending and when. 
However, with the dice game I had immediate access to my full balance and the odds looksed good. I have an 88% chance to make 30% on my money and only a 12% chance of losing everything? I'm game!
I wish I had the foresight to understand the ramifications of seriously losing everything. It just didn't seem real. It's very, very easy to gamble it all away with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:14:40
I've calmed down quite a bit from before. A lot had to do with the comments here and just taking a moment to catch my breath. I am not 100% yet but I'm getting there. 
You're absolutely right though about not thinking about it anymore. I need to clear my head of it or I'll keep beating myself up and down about it. That's probably the worst part of it all; the mental anguish. But at this point I'm looking towards a more positive situation and will do my best to stay that way.
Thank you richboytrader, I hope you're having better luck than me!
@_date: 2014-02-16 09:20:52
I have tried using electrum yes. I haven't used it since however. I'll do that. 
The issue I suppose is that it is still showing a bad balance (and I acted on that thinking it was just "catching up" or something. I know I saw the creator posting somewhere about the client. Maybe I'll try to contact him. Or maybe someone who know his details can direct me/lead him here. 
Either way, thanks 
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:45:50
No, I do not believe I was scammed. I believe that the duplicate or ghost transactions that generated from the Transaction Malleability caused my client(s) to show I had an inflated balance of btc. For example, for a time while I was betting, my Balance showed I had over 30 btc when I started with around 10. The "Spendable" balance would catch up and then deplete and take it's time to recover. However for about 12-18 hours my balance remained at 30 btc and my spendable remained around 0. I assumed I was just waiting for the transactions to move through (they were just being sluggish for whatever reason?) but then my overall balance began dipping, and dipping, until finally it showed spendable near zero and over all balance at around 1 btc. In fact, I had multiple wallets open on Multibit and they were *and still are* showing incorrect, inflated balances with transaction ids that don't exist (I'll take a screen shot right now to show this and add the transaction id). 
I never, ever would have kept gambling my money away if I was aware I was just losing it. I made a mistake by not understanding something with the clients and the transactions. I also made a poor decision in the first place to gamble with what I had anyways.
[Another screenshot of my a balance and a transaction that doesn't exist?]( The tx id, so you don't have to manually punch it in, is 8fdc2b020abb9077cca3374e422f6a7532594fab55958b172553f3fa322fd480.

Okay, I hadn't thought of it quite like that. My Multibit and Bitcoin-qt wallets were both showing completely incorrect overall balances (unconfirmed, so it saw something on the network/blockchain that was intended for me, right?) so maybe that is what happened. I'm going to start a new thread about my issue with Multibit and maybe I'll be able to find some answers there. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 09:44:14


 
Am I missing a reference here? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:18:51
Haha. Well, I don't think anyone will send me btc. Nor do I deserve it. 
That being said, some of the addresses I used were:
They are all clearly empty in comparison to what my multibit account says for each AVAILABLE balance (you can see it on the top above spendable.) 
What's really interesting is that when I opened it earlier today, it sent more transactions that must have been stuck? I don't get it. I wish I understood more of this.

Well, for what it's worth, I *never* intended to gamble away my entire worth. I was under the impression that I had upwards of 30 btc (with a profit of 20 btc) however I discovered later that my balances were showing incorrect. I explained this and posted pictures of that fact as well.
I do agree that i made poor decisions, however. That part is absolutely true.

Wow, what a coincidence. My major is in fact Economics (due to a lack of a business or finance degree at my UC school) and my goal is to work in the stock market. Broker or something along that line.
I know 7k is just a relative figure in my life and you're right it does feel monumental to me right now. Here's to hopefully making it where you did. I'm not religious whatsoever so in lieu of praying I'm just going to try and be positive I'll make it out of this shit. Thank you for the kind words.

@_date: 2014-02-16 22:20:28
Okay, so dooglus kind of hit the nail on the head here. 
To address what you said: I am definitely admitting to making poor decisions overall. The issue that sincerely escalated my poor decision to gamble was the fact I was under the impression I was winning quite a bit more than I had. In reality, I ended up slowly losing everything because my Balance was showing a grossly incorrect and inflated amount. 
I do not believe satoshi bones stole my money whatsoever. I believe that the transaction malleability during the ddos or whatever it did fucked up my balances to the point that it appeared I had loads more than what I had in reality (like showing double received for each "win" maybe, I'm not sure.) For some reason my client (Multibit) told me I had around 30 btc, but never updated to reflect the lack of funds (and I am NOT an expert on this, this is just the general consensus I've gotten from others who have weighed in so far and my elementary understanding of the issue.)
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:27:42
I posted some of the addresses and an imgur link to what my balances show on mulitbit.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:53:20
So, you received yen from Gox within the last couple days? I feel like that would be a pretty big deal considering the recent trend of nothing in nothing out. Is there something I'm missing here?
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:53:09
I'm glad my misfortune could put someone at ease haha. In all reality, however, I wouldn't look at losing $20 as "just" $20. Then, you might start thinking it's "just" $100. 
Also I'd probably enter a bare-knuckle boxing fight right now for $20 at this point. Just think of the entertainment THAT could have been?!
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:40:26
That thought crossed my mind as well (about the guy who gave me the btc.)
However, I stated before to others, that I don't think it was the blockchain so much as the confusion of bets and the response time of my overall Balance updating. (Multibit gives two numbers, Spendable and [overal] Balance), I was sending my Spendable balance thinking I had 30 btc or so to play with. Then the spendable stopped updating. So I waited. However when the dust settled I woke up to nothing. In fact, my multibit acct still shows I have 3 or 4 or 5 btc still floating around across a couple addresses... which is NOT the case. I checked. 20 times.  In the hopes that I had SOMETHING with which to salvage.
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:31:49
Definitely. Without a doubt. I'll take more risks in the future but the difference will be I have this experience to lean on. I won't take that level of risk with my livelihood in the future again, either.

@_date: 2014-02-16 10:52:39
Yeah, I did that after I took the screenshot. But either way, none of those balances are real whether they are in gox dollars or bitstamp. Multibit isn't displaying my balances correctly for some reason (which led me to over bet what I actually had causing me to seriously lose everything I have.)
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:30:59
Although I don't believe I'll be doing any gambling until I'm very, very financial stable (or at all for that matter) I did  look up what you mentioned. I didn't realize there were formulas or strategies quite like that associated with gambling. Definitely interesting information.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:20:04
What I would have given to be in THAT guy's place. I guess it's just as much of a gamble to HAVE coins as it is to dice them.
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:50:53
Sorry, I see how you could see that as shirking my responsibility on the whole situation. And I understand what you're saying completely. I mentioned the TM issues simply because I assumed I had more than I did, so I didn't think I was losing anything. Therefore I was justifying my gambling because I was, in my mind, a "winner".
However, the fact that I didn't stop when I assumed I had made double my initial investment is a testament to the fact I let it consume me. I just kept going and didn't stop to make sure everything was right. Even so, I shouldn't have gambled with money I needed to survive. 
You're right. The reason I lost everything is because I sincerely lost control of myself and the situation. If I want to avoid something like that in the future I need to consider these things. Thank you.

You know I was holding out for that as well for a while... But at this point I'm 99% sure it's all gone. A combination of bad choices and bad timing made this situation go from bad to worse.
At the suggestion of a handful of people here I'll be trying to get in touch with the creator of Multibit and maybe even the bitzillions satoshi dice gambling site... But I doubt it will pan out into anything. These people won't give me any money (back) and honestly I'll need to find a source of income quickly before it all comes crashing down around me.
Nice thought though, for sure. Maybe I'll get lucky!

Look at them and decide for yourself. I can send you pictures from today as well with my balances still showing wildly incorrect. Or whatever else you think would be ideal in providing more clarity to the situation. In the meantime, consider putting your pitchfork away.
