What are you disagreeing with? Are we not paranoid in nature that we take preventive actions for probable errors. I said paranoid in a good sense. Only the paranoids survive! :)

Fair. Thinking of it, We are all a bunch of paranoids. :)

Go to bitcointalk and read the posts from the first 2-3 months. All your confusions are discussed there in detail.

When I said infinity, it means Fiat to zero thus bitcoin’s price will not be denominated in another currency. Rather in terms of goods and services depending on demand and supply

You seem not to understand what money is and how money evolves in society.

If you like to read. Get a copy of the bitcoin standard by saifedean ammous. It’s available for free.

Bitcoin will have a binary outcome zero or infinity. And zero will happen only from a technical failure.  It’s possible. But unlikely.

Guess risk averse people’s involvement in bitcoin further strengthens its value proposition and legitimacy.

Your blog is the most common argument against bitcoin. As you have admitted you don’t understand ‘this thing’. Here is a good blog post by [saifedean]( . 
In this bear market, if you feel like taking a second look at bitcoin to understand the problem statement and the solution bitcoin provides the society, you could read ‘the bitcoin standard ‘.

Your statement about bitcoin’s value proposition is naive and has been discussed a ton times and is easily available on the internet to find. Good luck. 
Believer of what? Mathematics?

‘Safety that words provide’  could you elaborate please. 
Index of the words from this list. Assuming this list remains in the same order. Isn’t this same as holding on to the words!?
