They don't know much about this topic, they are just regurgitating what their "experts" are reporting to them. Not only are those "experts" uneducated on the subject as well, but they are also more than likely inside the pockets of firmly established financial institutions. Institutions that still use the television to sell their wares to John Q. Public.

Just change your Coinbase address info to match your ID. They are confirming your identity, not trying to send you weekly newsletters.

That's between you and your bank. Coinbase isn't tapping the bank and asking, "Hey, does this guy reallllllyy live there?" 
Again, it's identity confirmation. They believe you to be the only person to know the addresses you are entering. If someone else knows those addresses and is trying to open a Coinbase account, well then that's probably identity theft and just further proves why the authentication process is imperative.

It's funny when people say "don't listen to reddit" or "do your own research." I mean, I'm here because it's the most comprehensive resource for research and it has an open forum for discussion. But because everything is so speculative right now, nobody is really going to have an answer for you. Best advice is just to invest as much as you are willing to lose. Wait for a dip, don't wait for a dip... Hell, part of me wants to put 20k in today, the other more responsible part wants to put in 100 a month. In the end it's your call.

It's common practice for the internet to make jokes out of keystroke errors. It represents typing "hold" too quickly and misspelling it "hodl." Now it's just bitcoin legend.

@_date: 2017-12-07 21:43:54
Whatever price you bought it at is locked in. After the first purchase is done pending after 10 days I’ve heard subsequent purchases take ~10 minutes. I recommend moving money to your USD wallet to trade directly from there though. Directly using gdax.com will avoid transfer fees though, so I recommend that over Coinbase. (Coinbase owns Gdax, btw. So you can just sign in with your Coinbase info)
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:47:44
December 10th. And yes, that is generally how you would make/save money. But people who are buying now and holding don’t expect a dip, rather a continuous climb much like what we’re seeing now.  It could crash, it could stay, it could climb higher. Nobody has an answer to that.

Let me explain what this faggot is doing. He films himself crying and trying to lick the toothpaste off the side of his lip for 10 minutes, crying about how he lost his money in bitcoin. Then at 10:04 he says "just kidding!!!" 
If your video is over 10 minutes long on youtube, you get kicked into a higher tier of ad revenue or something along those lines. So he's just scamming the system and scamming his pathetic subscribers on YT. What a shit platform, what a shit video, and what a shit post to just boost this guy's ad revenue by giving it views. This should be marked for removal by a mod.

Best advice I could have given would have been to flip your first and second steps around. Verify all of your identity information BEFORE you make a transfer. It's very finicky (rightfully so) when it comes to identity authorization. 
Also, ID card information like your address needs to match your information entered on Coinbase. It doesn't care if you have a mailing address different than your billing address, if it doesn't match it will kick it back.
As to whether the transfer has gone through or not, I don't know what to tell you, it's a very very busy time for Coinbase and any customer support right now is going to be especially scarce.

This is still the ground floor tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:52:12
So you make a shitpost with a title firmly STATING that a large "correction" or "crash" is coming when you actually don't know that. You then continue to give some backstory about how you used to mine but got out, but now you're back in... wtf? Here, have a downvote. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:49:09
Up to you, I personally made a big purchase for my first time. Even though it was pending for over a week, it still locked me in for the price at which I bought it.
