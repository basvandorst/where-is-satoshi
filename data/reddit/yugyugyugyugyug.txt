That's it right there.  Consider also that your family is the reason that you are alive and in the relatively stable life situation that you're in, having (I assume) grown up well-fed, housed, and with a computer and the time to get interested in BTC early.  At the opportunity, your family A. received a return on THEIR investment in making you smart enough to see a good investment and able to act on it, and B. taught you to keep your good fortune selectively private.  Sucks.  But a good lesson.

Yeah that’s a pretty far stretch

Nice.  Great idea, awesome execution.

You could also opt for very small, grainy porn.  I don’t know if you knew that.

Funny, I do recall that! I think you’re pretty much right on. That said, for my money it’s a space worth entering.  Not for a quick Lambo, but as something to put some resources and attention to before it becomes ubiquitous in fifteen years.

Not overly!  I mean, it is plagiarized from the Onion.  But dying at your job is not necessarily a worse alternative to say, living as a widow.

That’s a pretty fair assessment.  Couldn’t you say the same thing about the Internet in the early 90s when everybody had a land line, though?  Obviously the tech has a lot of development to do.  But let’s look at say, Ethereum.  Sure, you can use it as a currency, but the real value is using the tokens to power extremely secure distributed ledgers.  You don’t think that’s going to start pushing back on other forms of currency?  It IS getting better, all the time.

You and have pretty great points here.  You’re right, easily accessible deflationary currency could really break the bank, and not in a positive way.  Right now we’re seeing huge growth in deflationary coin value because they’re being compared to inflationary currency, of course their number value will go up super high.  Doesn’t make them the best way to handle money. Could be the great innovation in the next ten years is how to make them play well together
