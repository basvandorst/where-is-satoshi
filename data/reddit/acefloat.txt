It looks like they are going to join the community in regards to financial institutions and obviously they come with regulations. With takedowns of dnm's and aml/kyc laws they are trying to legitimize it so they can enter. To what extent can they regulate is to be seen, it's difficult because it's global so governments would have to work together to go after people. There will be places that are beyond their reach I imagine so who knows. Everything I see in the news and read etc just looks like they are trying to lay a foundation to get in. 
By no means is it a bad thing for bitcoin or its purpose. It's a decentralized currency available to anyone with internet, that doesn't meant it has the right to ignore conventional laws, only the ability. If users all want to break away from regulations well they have every right to but that is a very contentious issue

Buy a little over 1 so when you move it you still have a full coin because of fees :) like 1.005

It wouldn't take much for gov to develop a super computer to track and associate all transactions on the block chain with known users (people who buy from KYC/AML exchanges) for irs purposes.
With that said you can easily wash your coins and send them to new addresses and take steps for privacy.
You have to expect gov to try and regulate because that's what they do. When they are faced with the problem they can't regulate what can they do? We'll see what approach they take. 
Right now it looks like "if you can't beat em join em"

Nobody can tell you for sure. 
Here is my story: knew about btc in 2010 but had no interest, heard about it again when it hit 1300, then again at 200 and then again at 2k+. Now I don't have much money saved and I haven't started investing my savings so I fomo'd Into btc at the ATH at 2700 fearing I wouldn't be able to afford it if it kept rising.. and it tanked 500$ within the hour of my purchase. I felt shitty and talked to parents for advice, they said hey I'm proud you took a risk and invested for your future, don't sell it at a loss and if it stresses you out forget about it and check next year. 
I started researching obsessively because I just put a bunch of money into something and I became more certain that I invested wisely even if it was losing value at the moment. I hodled and now I'm pretty damn green. 
My advice is don't spend what you aren't willing to lose, and you only lose if you sell. Good luck 
Tldr; I fomo'd in, lost value but instead of selling I researched, became convinced it was well worth my investment.

On coinbase if your bank account is linked you can buy immediately, but won't have access to btc until 5-9 days. They have a fee of 1.49%
Gdax has lower fees but if I'm not mistaken you have to load your money on the exchange 5-9 days before you can use it. 
I could be wrong but this all means if you want to buy now, use coinbase and pay fee. If you want to buy without the 1.49% fee you need to fund your account 5-9days before you can buy.
Correct me if I'm wrong ?

Ok so price goes up and down, what about the purchases that he "gets $500 free" those are also possible. My assumption is that as long as it gains value on average over time - it works out for everyone - until btc is liquid enough to retain stable value
