Finally your grandma is working with bitcoins? 
@_date: 2014-03-28 09:39:30
no, your first BTC purchase was dugs and guns. Don't cheat me
@_date: 2014-03-24 10:15:12
The payment is n't in MAD escrow, and was paid to the seller... How is that possible?
@_date: 2014-07-11 08:57:44
Pls speak English bro
@_date: 2014-07-11 08:58:54
Your wife can become a cheater and your life can be ruined. But your ancestors and relatives will never cheat with you
@_date: 2014-07-11 09:28:39

@_date: 2014-07-11 09:03:31

There are still a lot of idealists here.  I'm one of them 
@_date: 2014-08-03 23:54:23


That's how people make money. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 23:59:14

@_date: 2014-07-11 09:03:02
I can't understand your reference to China
@_date: 2014-07-11 09:03:54
I'm pretty sure that there is no law in Vietnam which prohibits bitcoins
@_date: 2014-07-11 09:26:44
Your grandma think like a young man
@_date: 2014-07-11 09:26:02
Now my grandma will be addicted to this digital currency too
@_date: 2014-07-11 08:55:21
You should google for that. Maybe you are lucky and will find an online shop which accept bitcoins
@_date: 2014-07-11 09:21:16
It's a Bitcoin magic
@_date: 2014-08-03 23:56:05

Your power and their techs will bring us to the Moon
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:37:48
Agreed. 
Banks backing Bitcoin is really impressive since Bitcoin is their competitor. I wonder why did they do that?

The choice should be as easy and as understandable as a fiat money. No one wants to waste their time on some "mysterious" money technology.

Good guys Stripe and Facebook. 
With their budget in mind it's almost free PR among geeks.
