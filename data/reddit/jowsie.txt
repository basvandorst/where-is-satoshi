This answers none of my questions about the google doc you linked.

Whilst I completely agree with what you are saying, it's a bit late to not 'use a web wallet', as that's where my bitcoins currently are. I am attempting to move them out of the web wallet, but am having trouble getting confirmations, due to what I detailed above.
Do you have any info on using RBF/CPFP to speed up the process, like I asked?

It should give you an idea of the average IQ of the HODLers over here :)

Even if you wanted to transfer it to another exchange to sell, the fee's alone to transfer would eat 90% of your bitcoin.
If you're so hard up that $26 is crucial to your survival why the fuck did you spend it on bitcoin?!
So many idiot kids ruining their lives over this shit.

OK, how do I take the keys from the blockchain.info wallet? I don't see any obvious option allowing me to do that.

I paid what was an above average fee at the time I sent my transaction (nearly 48 hours ago) but the fee is roughly half of what people are paying now.
The fee calculator sites are saying my fee should confirm in roughly 21 hours ... I'm way past that.
I was hoping to cash out the bit I sent yesterday. Looks like I'm going to end up having to wait for it to drop out of the mempool completely and re-send it.

You're gonna be pretty upset when it tanks with these high unconfirmed transactions, haha.
It's a rollercoaster.

I've used localbitcoins in the UK, was painless.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:34:41
A long time. I sent one with 170/byte around 10 hours ago and still 0 confirmations.

It's like when your mum bought you a playstation for christmas so you had to go and tell all your friends that playstation is THE BEST and xbox and nintendo SUCK DICK.
Except it's 10x worse because it's easier to be an idiot when talking about crypto, and the people screaming have invested their own money into it.

Where did it come from? Who runs it? What pools does it submit too?
Gonna need some more information ...
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:50:57
Why would you decide to start doing your research AFTER buying in?! Doesn't seem very smart.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:34:02
There is no 1 set value for how much your bitcoins are worth. They are simply worth whatever someone else is willing to pay for them. Your options of who you can sell them too will depend on which exchange you decide to use.

It's like hearing someone say 'wow xxx stock sure has gone up a lot in the last week' then immediately dumping your life savings in based on that information alone.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:39:33
Yup

95% of available hashrate was being used on bitcoin when we were at 170k ... there's no more miners to come help
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:37:07
i've used localbitcoins before and got paid by bank transfer. you'll have to verify some information though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:35:34
you're not the only one. it's not on coinbase's end.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:19:15
i paid 170/byte 12 hours ago and no confirmations :(

How is it childish to understand and accept where the food comes from, and still enjoy the taste?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:41:35
shows plenty for me 
that's just the first few that show up without searching any further.

You must be fun at parties.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:38:24
Did you comment here purely to talk down to me based on the wallet I chose to use 5 years ago? I'm not sure why you've decided to reply to this thread when you can't answer the question this post was made to address ...

Desperate times call for desperate measures, sometimes lying to yourself is the only way to get to sleep that night.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:26:15
Glad to see you're more sensible than most people jumping in on this lately ;)
Best of luck!

If it was easy enough to make money from bitcoin that it could be put into a simple reddit post, everyone would be doing it ...
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:20:47
you made a bot that buys low and sells high?! jesus christ don't let day traders know this is a thing that can be done!

I paid 170 sat/B on a transaction roughly 8 hours ago and no confirmations yet. unconfirmed transactions has been steadily increasing from around 160k transactions between then and now and other than the few threads in /new I'm surprised this isn't on the front page at all ...
