In accounting terminology, it's referred to as an unrealized gain. When you sell, the profit, or gain, is "realized."

He's talking out of his fucking ass. Serious, mainstream investors, for better or worse, are NOT looking to diversify into bitcoin.

really is a perfect case study for emotional bias and cognitive error. Pick a comment thread and finding them is like shooting fish in a barrel. Perversely, the more upvotes a comment has, the worse it is. When the market corrects (and it will eventually - you're naive if you think otherwise) these biases will only shine brighter. I wish I could find a rational discussion on bitcoin because the idea very much interests me. I'm just not interested in a 24/7 circle-jerk, which is all this sub is. 
Someone start please.

It's refreshing that at least one comment in here isn't totally drunk on bitcoin kool-aid.

Transitioning to circle-jerk? The entire subreddit has been an uncritical circle jerk for a LONG time.

This is exactly the sentiment OP is talking about.

I must have missed the "major financial catastrophe over the last nine months." Was that tongue in cheek? I certainly hope so.

Because everything is bullish news.

I'm so confused. You go on and on about technological innovations that came and went quickly. Then conclude with, OF COURSE BITCOIN IS HERE TO STAY FOREVER.
