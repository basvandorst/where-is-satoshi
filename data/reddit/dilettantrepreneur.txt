This is only true for purely offline software. If the software communicates with any server anywhere at any time then you also have to trust the identity and security of that server.


While true, I think these risks can be mitigated through software and business practices. What if the javascript and HTML were signed, and one could easily verify if and when it had changed, and choose whether to download the new code. This could be accomplished by a third party if the first party wasn't trusted, or it could be built into a browser plugin, or a dedicated secure browsing app.

I don't think this is a correct intepretation.
Banks may not invest in, transact in, or insure bitcoin. Businesses may not price products in Bitcoin or treat it as currency for active commerce. Third party payment providers who are not banks may not be used as deposit avenues for Bitcoin exchanges.
However, Bitcoin exchanges are still legal, and it is still legal for citizens to obtain and exchange bitcoin as an investment. The only things China really cares about is that Bitcoin does not replace or destabilize the Yuan, and does not become a useful currency for commerce transactions, and if it is used to move money around or out of China, they want 100% of the fiat in those transactions to be trackable through their government-controlled banking system so they know exactly how much Yuan is moving into Bitcoin and who has it.

It's not a stupid idea in and of itself, but it does suffer from the same problem that any bitcoin-related software suffers from. You have to trust the code and you have to trust the coder and their security practices. Very hard to audit everything, but doesn't mean that every good idea needs to get shit on. Having an HTML5-only wallet that stores no sensitive data on any device is a good idea.

It's also well known that the entire MtGox user database, names, account balances, and lots of personally identifying documents were leaked by hackers. It should be trivial to provide a username or account number to let anyone with access to Gox's data confirm that you did have the balance you claimed. I'm positive the US government has copies of that data. They'd be stupid not to.

I understand a judge or a prosecutor could try to nail you on that, but technically isn't it only money laundering when you KNOW that the money you accepted originated as profits from a criminal enterprise?
If I hand you $10, you have no idea that money came from selling crack unless I say to you, "Here is $10 of my crack money. Spend it on crack."
Same as if I sell you a Bitcoin in person. You have no idea where it came from, and as long as I never tell you where I got it, you have plausible deniability.

I should only have to trust my bank.
They are the ones I tell the amount to, and they are the ones who send it.
They do not give permission for the other bank to take it from my account, nor do they give permission for more funds than I have authorized to be withdrawn.
You should trust the person you're wiring money to the same way you should trust the person you're sending bitcoins to for that purchase. But it has nothing to do with the ability for them to withdraw extra unauthorized funds from your account.
Nothing on the internet backs up your story:
Don't send money to Nigerian princes, and don't give out your bank account numbers. But, there is nothing risky or unsafe about sending money to someone via a wire as opposed to other methods.

So removing fees means people can make money from selling at lower highs and buying at higher lows (reducing the spread). Adding negative fees reduces the spread further. This also adds liquidity to the market by making deeper order books. Deeper order books and tighter spreads both mean less volatility.

The only time I have ever had a problem with BTC deposits or withdrawls on BTC-e was while the Bitcoin network was being spammed with transactional malleability attempts, but before anyone halted withdrawls.
I sent a message to BTC-e support that my BTC deposit wasn't showing up, even though it was on the blockchain, and they replied within a day with the problem solved.
Not everybody has had bad experiences with BTC-e. And to play devil's advocate, it does make sense that they may have issues with cash withdrawls or deposits if they are operating anonymously. Banks and governments don't like giving accounts to anonymous people running anonymous exchanges.

Only after BitcoinBuilder went online did I ever make the conscious decision to put funds in MtGox, and only as an informed gamble.
Anyone considering putting their money in any exchange should research that exchange first. If they don't, they don't have any right to say "I didn't know!". They can say "You didn't tell me so" but they can't say "You didn't tell anyone so" if the warnings are out there to be found.

If Gox creditors get anything back for their GoxBTC, then Josh Jones would be one of those creditors.
He has promised to distribute to BitcoinBuilder account holders their fair share of whatever he is able to recoup from Gox.
He also promised to keep BitcoinBuilder open so we could keep trading GoxBTC forever, and he broke that promise abruptly and without warning.
So, we have some history of reputable dealings followed by a big fuck you. How much faith do you have in Josh Jones' conviction to follow through with passing on a Gox reimbursement to his customers?

Okay. How would it work then? What data are you actually transmitting from the card to the reader with Coinkite?
I presume in a traditional CC transaction, the card number itself is transmitted, and intercepting that transmission (or making an unauthorized read) would allow the attacker to spend the victim's funds.
With Coinkite, presumably you have a balance in your cloud wallet, and a merchant has set up a pending transaction with an amount, and you swipe your card to authorize that amount. I really don't know much about Coinkite so please correct me if I'm wrong.
In the Coinkite scenario, some data must be passed from the card to the merchant's POS machine. What is that data? How does it identify the spender, amount, or authorization? And what would prevent an attacker from making fake purchases and walking past people with NFC-enabled cards to steal their funds?

1. 'bit' is already a well defined word in computer science. So well-defined that many people who barely even know how to use a computer still know what a 'bit' is, or at the very least know 'bits and bytes' mean computer data.
2. 'bit' is also already a slang word for specific amounts of fiat currency. While it would be cool to say 'shave and a haircut; 2 bits' and mean bitcoin, it only adds confusion.
3. I do not think we should be adding confusion by using words with multiple extant meanings unless there is no ambiguity possible. Having a word which overlaps with both finance and computer science may seem like a good idea, but I would say it introduces maximum confusion and ambiguity. If we are going to adopt a word already in use, it should be from an unrelated field like Ice Skating. How about we call μBTC a Lutz or a Salchow?

Still, any software which communicates to a server and has access to your local device can transmit all sorts of sensitive data.

Great point about utility vs intrinsic value. I had an argument about this in a bar with a friend recently, who was trying to tell me that gold had intrinsic value while paper money and Bitcoin had none. I tried to argue that 'intrinsic value' is a judgment that a society places on something once it has sufficient utility for it, or knows how to work with it. He then responded by tearing up 5 dollar bills on the floor to prove they had no intrinsic value. To me it just proved he had destroyed the utility value of his fiat money to buy him another beer.

I like Millibit, like Milimeter. maybe mBT or (em-bit) as an abbreviation.

Awesome. I had just finished hooking up my own Bitcoin-enabled e-commerce site for my band's new album when I saw your post :)
I'll have to check out some Monstercat music as I work on upgrading my own site.

In case anyone wanted to see these videos, here are links to the three I've posted so far. I've included a bibliography, so you can check out the source footage.

This is a great idea, but I have a few serious questions.
1. What facilities do you have in place to deal with unresponsive arbitrators who would suspend transactions in limbo? Do you have the ability to approve the transactions for Bob and Alice if their Arbitrator won't respond in X number of days?
2. I see arbitrators in your directory who want Bob and Alice to disclose their real identities. How is this information, and other communications between the parties, transmitted and stored on your website?

I think the high intellectual sentiment here is that the news is good because "OMG CHEAP COINS 4 MEEEE!"

Having a visual representation of something is useful to human psychology. Many people are visual thinkers, and for them, having the image of a tangible thing in their mind is as important as knowing the name of something in order to refer to it and think about it.

Not a bad analysis, but without putting actual numbers on the drug and gambling industries' use of Bitcoin, they are ignoring extant value in the currency. Just saying "since it's public police might track you" is not an excuse to eliminate the data. I've seen numbers suggesting illicit goods and gambling account for ~30% of Bitcoin transactions.

Yeah I made a tentative 1 BTC buy last week on Coinbase. It still hasn't cleared. The very next day I wanted to buy 3 more and was bummed it wouldn't let me.
Since it was the only place I had a verified account, I didn't think I could get more coins anywhere else same-day, but I probably should have tried localbitcoins.com.

I think that's too much of a loophole to do publicly. 
Yes, people can and will barter privately using Bitcoin, the same you may barter using Gold if you found someone to accept it at an attractive rate who had something you wanted to trade for.
But, to codify that publicly in a website, sign, or payment procedure as part of your business and advertising is a different thing. I suspect saying "We barter for Bitcoin" on your storefront would draw the ire of the government.
What I bet will happen is that the more tech-savvy merchants in marketplaces, as well as all the people selling pirated or already illicit goods, will have no problem accepting Bitcoin and telling their customers so.
