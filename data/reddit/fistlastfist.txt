Debt as a percent of GDP is nice to look at and easy trick to calm people down. 
Those numbers are form 2011 but you get the idea. (Feel free to update those to 2014/15 figures. 
Some stats about the US government:
* U.S. Tax revenue: $2,170,000,000,000
* Fed budget: $3,820,000,000,000
* New debt: $ 1,650,000,000,000
* National debt: $14,271,000,000,000 (2015 it's at $18,532,854,382,821) 
* Recent budget cuts: $ 38,500,000,000
Now, remove 8 zeroes and pretend it’s a household budget:
* Annual family income: $21,700
* Money the family spent: $38,200
* New debt on the credit card: $16,500
* Outstanding balance on the credit card: $142,710
* Total budget cuts: $385

What ever you do, stay clear form Bitstamp.
(edit) After you convert your coins to fiat and you like to transfer you money out, they start demanding all sorts of information and will not release your funds.  
This is what is waiting you in Bitstamp, **after** they have your money and you like to transfer it out. (Some of those questions are just silly) 
* How did you learn about Bitcoin?
* The purpose of trading on Bitstamp? Please describe in as much detail as possible how you intend to use your trading account.
*  What is the **origin of the deposited Bitcoins?** If mining, please specify your hardware specifications and submit a **receipt or an invoice for your mining equipment**
* What are your future plans and activities planned on our exchange?
* Do you plan more withdrawals in the future?
* Estimated amount that you would be depositing/withdrawing to/from your Bitstamp account per month (in USD and BTC)?
