That's still 3.25-6.5% of the transaction.  I can see why they wouldn't go to Bitcoin just yet.

I disagree.  If I sell a gun to someone with the knowledge that they are going to go shoot up a school with it, that should make me a criminal.  Granted, the Bitcoin thing is less severe than that example.
Just my opinion and I respect where you are coming from on your opinion as well.  I don't like the whole entrapment angle from the government either.

Maybe if the transaction fees for BTC weren't so high.  Correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't a 2 dollar (~0.003 BTC) transaction still have a fee that works out to over 60 cents?  That's not workable for what laundry typically costs to do.

Rude, but correct.  We need to give these stories the publicity they deserve so people are aware of what's happening.

Yes, but only after the sellers still went through with the transaction when the undercover agent who bought the Bitcoin told the sellers they were going to use the Bitcoin to buy stolen credit cards.

If you believe people were lining up to pay with Apple Pay, I have an ebola-infected bridge to sell you.

I got the same thing today.  It's got to be false positive, but I'm not sure if I need to do anything since a bunch of SST files were deleted.

If you sell something to someone (in this case BTC) with the knowledge that it will be used during the commission of a felony, I believe that's illegal.  I am not a lawyer but it does seem like that's a fair rule.  The undercover cop told the bitcoin trader that they will be using the bitcoin to purchase stolen credit cards.  The bitcoin trader decided to sell them bitcoin anyway with that knowledge.

  Maybe that will answer the question.  Chrome on Win 8.1.
