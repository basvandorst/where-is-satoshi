TL DR: dont regulate yet, wait for the bitcoin eco-system to grow before making regulations but do make clarifications regarding centralized business.

@_date: 2014-09-30 18:03:29
maybe the crowd should be everyday working man, not hooded mob but business man, families etc.

I think many commercials are like that: describing/showing the problem, making the viewer to sympathize with the "actor" because they have gone through it before. and then utilities on the emotion reaction to intrduce the ultimate soultion.
@_date: 2014-10-16 19:56:38
sorry english is not my native language.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:39:43
I guess you look for liquidity as a remittence business, and bitcoin is the best one.
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:10:13
I viewed your service and noticed that the process of sending money is owning bitcoin first.
Do you plan on implementing a process which is FIAT to FIAT to the costumer and behind the scence is FIAT to BITCOIN to FIAT?
I hope you understood, english bad. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:29:29

Anyone has information about IBM`s "adept" that was said to be revealed in CES?
@_date: 2016-01-05 23:46:39
There are no sites, you need to find those bettors or individuals that have those skins to liquidate.
@_date: 2016-01-05 11:01:11
You might want to take a look at uphold.com where you can store your btc as $ and when you need to trade and buy skins you can send btc without paying conversation fees all while keeping your funds safe from volatility.     
I trade skins as well and that is how i deal with my btc.
@_date: 2016-01-05 10:46:34
In short : yes, buy low sell high.     
The long story is that a huge betting/gambling market has been developed around skins with betting on pro games, jackpot sites and other gambling games.    
Usually the winners of those activities will seek to liquidate their skins for real money, that is where you can buy those skins at deep discounts, sometimes as low as 50%.
@_date: 2016-01-05 07:44:59
I can buy in 1.8, so?
@_date: 2016-01-05 06:22:40
the in-game currency is keys the holds a constant value of 2.5$.    
funny enough you can hold your funds in keys to avoid skins or currency volatility.    
But I see what you saying as valve had previously caused a crash in the DOTA 2 market.
