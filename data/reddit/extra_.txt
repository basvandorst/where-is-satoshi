Smells like FUD.  Why post without any actual proof.

Just got through.  ~~Seems to be only Japanese speaking staff at the phones though, so I couldn't get any useful information.~~  Got through again to an English speaker. See edit.
**Edit**: Seems like they don't have anything useful to tell us.  Just "check the website" and "an update will be there soon".  I asked her if it would be updated today and she said "very very soon".  They also took down my name, possibly for a list of creditors or something?  Also sounded like she was reading off a script somewhat.  Call here: 
**TL;DR They can't tell us anything, check the website for updates.**

Edit: Also after logging out, I cannot log back in.
Edit Edit: There are also a number of other problems.  Try looking at the login cookie set by the site.

I think if you input any arbitrary amount it defaults to $1, although I could  be wrong.

Is your CC a Visa card?  Right now that's the only provider they will accept for instant purchases.

Bitstamp &amp; CampBX do international wire / ACH transfers.  Not sure about the fees though.  Also, nothing will be close to Gox simply because no one can get any money out of there.

I'll give you a quote posted frequently around here: "Never invest more than you are willing to lose."
If you are willing to risk losing the entirety of your savings then go for it (I could use the price increase), but be aware of the consequences.
