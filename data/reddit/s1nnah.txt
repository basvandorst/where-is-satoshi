have a look at the site whattomine and put you GPU specs in. It should give you your most profitable coin to mine. be warned tho with one GPU it'll not be more than $2-3 per day

mine for bitcoin or mine 4 bitcoins?

i know m8. I've only got about $500 in there but I'd like to get it out cheaply. I'll probably just sit it out until the tx fees go down.

cheers fella, I'll check that out when i get home
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:37:18
oh I'll give this a go. I mine on a couple of 1060's just for fun but the $$$ all add up
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:01:17
i'm no expert but just wait till the wallet has sync'd. it should be good then. its a monster pain, last time I did it, it took nearly 4 days. not long to wait for $20,000 in the grand scheme of things.

yeah because banks and drug  dealers different how?

1. mining BTC with GPU isnt worth it, you'll never get ROI  
2. GTX 1060s offer good hashrate vs. cost. 3 cards will give you around 60Mhs I mostly mine ETC which currently returns 0.1 ETC a day with 2 cards 24/7. I then split those into LTC and ETH
3. I store my coins locally and keep 10% on an exchange  
4. Dont know never tried  
5. not sure  
7. dont know  
8. Look wjhat happened in Greece when their finanical system collapsed  
9. Dont know  
not the best answers I know but hope it helps a bit

I get paid for a couple of affiliate links. Its a slow and steady income that I've been putting into crypto for a while now. Up until very recently they have been happy to pay in £20-50 chunks. I've tried to cash out a couple recently and they dont wanna know. TBH its really screwed my plan.
My only entry point atm is a couple of 1060's mining ETC and thats going downhill fast

Haunted me too. I had a mere 1.5 back in 2013. had mined litecoin on the way up and traded them for btc shortly before it crashed back to $300. lost faith and then frittered the coin away.
I'm here now hustling my way back to 0.1btc. No big deal. still 'missed the boat' this time round. Got my hands on a pair of GTX1060's in may. It crossed my mind to get them mining something but I wanted to play cities skylines over the summer so I took a raincheck. I'd be quids in now. oh well leasson double learned... Don't lose faith, always hustle.

i run 2x1060's  I mostly just mine ETC and then maybe do a few days on a coin thats doing well and pays in whole coins. in the vague hope they'll do something some day
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:18:12
Valid point. They also have better weed which I'd hazard a guess amounted to a good 80% of the online market

Exactly. UK has a whole underground cannabis scene with packaged products labeled and dosed. Powered by reputation and Bitcoin. I ain't buying a quarter for 60quid + 20 fees it's madness. My guys want ltc or eth.

tbh both cards are in one box in my server room at work.... sssshhh dont tell them but it does mean no electric bill. I dunno maybe $3-4 a day. it all adds up tho. the ETC goes into ETH and LTC once a month. I make much more from affiliates (relatively speaking) that I put into BTC.

tbh I dont think I would. you'd struggle to get ROI on it. I just had the cards knocking about in work. ETC has been paying me quite well but times running out on it as the difficulty is going up quite steeply. I check 'whattomine' and if something takes my fancy and pays whole coins I'll hit it up for a few days purely as speculation then get back on the ETC.
my two cards mining ETC will net 0.1 coin a day and pay daily (a few weeks ago it was 0.15 coins). Mining on the pool I'm on, ETH min payment is 0.05 and that took a week last time I did it.
