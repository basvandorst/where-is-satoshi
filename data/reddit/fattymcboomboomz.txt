Meanwhile the FCA is looking to regulate businesses that publish open source software...

Yes, LocalMonero has released a LocalBitcoins alternative called AgoraDesk where KYC is not mandatory.
If you scroll to the bottom of the site there is a tor hidden service version.
Just so you are aware this is a peer-to-peer platform, so you are buying directly from other people, not the site itself.

I understand your point regarding trust/validation but on the other hand Bitcoin can be subject to a similar situation:
1. Denial of Service: The cashier rejects the payment method entirely just like with cash. Technically this can be applied to any payment type.
2. Fungibility problem: Your transaction is within n steps of a flagged transaction and subsequently rejected.

Do you know how the case handles cooling?

My response was most definitely relevant. I was addressing the original comment in which OP wrote : "but as long as you don’t cash out into your local currency and keep it  as bitcoins, **you will have no tax to pay until it’s in USD or whatever in your own bank account.".**
This is incorrect. Based on the information given, OP would trade for other cryptocurrencies, back to bitcoin, and think that no taxable event was triggered because it was never converted to USD.

Incorrect. You trigger a taxable event whenever you trade crypto for any other asset. That means selling Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency \*IS\* a taxable event. Trading one crypto for another on an exchange \*IS\* a taxable event. Any realized gains are taxed at the appropriate capital gains rate for your jurisdiction.

I didn't state whether Bitpay held your keys or not, in fact I don't know. It was a short piece of advice to help the user decide whether what they're using is safe or not. Hopefully my phrasing didn't give a false impression of how BitPay's app works.

Yes, I really hope they don't. According to Bloomberg, around 80% of point-of-sale transactions in Germany are done with cash.

That's alright :) Glad to see you find his content useful too.

Then you get lifestyle checked and they ask you to justify it with your "zero" income. If they don't buy it prepare to get audited.

Not your keys, not your crypto.
Edi: You need to check whether you have complete control of your keys with BitPay.

Depends how we are defining hyper-inflation. In terms of loss of value relative to goods and services, it could just as easily happen to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:19:04
Ah ok, didn't know that about BitPay, thanks for letting me know and apologies if my previous response was a little brash. I rarely use mobile wallets but if it was desktop I'd recommend bitcoin core or possibly electrum.

Perhaps 'The Internet of Money' by Andreas Antonopoulos.
Blurb excerpt: "Andreas goes beyond exploring the technical functioning of the bitcoin  network by illuminating bitcoin's philosophical, social, and historical  implications. As the internet has essentially transformed how people  around the world interact and has permanently impacted our lives in ways  we never could have imagined, bitcoin--the internet of money--is  fundamentally changing our approach to solving social, political, and  economic problems through decentralized technology."
Disclaimer: I haven't read this particular book from him. It's less technical than Mastering Bitcoin.

As others have suggested, move your funds to a hardware wallet. Not your keys, not your crypto.
