What? No. I'm saying "don't try to catch a falling knife". I'm not saying that bitcoin is not a good idea, just not right now. Have you looked at charts? Fundamentals? Everything is looking bad right now. The knife is falling. I think it will come back up later (thus holding), but for now... why risk it?

No one can get money or bitcoins out of gox. The numbers for gox should actually be "undefined" right now.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:39:18
Honestly, I don't know why you would. Shit is really hitting the fan right now. It's better to lose out on opportunity than to lose money. This is from someone who right now holds a lot of bitcoin and regrets it :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:36:26
Well, ok. But then you're not "newly rich", you've just got some on-paper (ironic phrasing, I know) money.
Any amount you cash out (i.e. to spend on things, which is the only way you're "rich") must have taxes paid, so make sure to do so.

Sorry, HeIsMyPossum is right. It is unsustainable. Period. Maybe it's sustainable for the next week, or even (crazy) 2 weeks, but it is unsustainable long term. With the current growth, bitcoin market cap will outgrow the world GDP in a month.
You're crazy to think that's sustainable.

I'm not american, so this actually does not apply to me (directly), but my wife is, so I know the regulations. As long as you hold a US citizenship, you'll be stuck to US financial laws.
There's likely in import tax you'll have to pay. Beyond that, I have no idea, since it doesn't affect me and will not happen to me.

You live in a republic. Suck it up, or put proper effort into changing things. You're welcome to move somewhere else. In fact, I was wrong in my original statement. You can avoid paying the IRS. Move yourself somewhere that you don't have to pay them. Antarctica is essentially free from taxes. So are many parts of Africa. Go live there.

No one really lost, did they?
Just some people won more than others. I'm definitely not doing amazing, but it's nice to be ahead on one investment. Let's see if Bitcoin can take over my "best investment" title.
@_date: 2013-10-26 14:20:16
Eh, you're right on the A" point. I'm being an idiot (there).
But what is sixteen in hexadecimal (base sixteen)? it's 10. So the original point still stands.
Example: if A is 10 in bases above ten, then saying it's "A" in base *whatever*, means it's ten.

The great depression was kicked off by a 20% drop in two days, and without a doubt, that was a "crash".
In the bitcoin circles lately, we have a different name for 20% changes. "Monday".
If it can easily go up 20%, it can easily go down 20%. There is little, if any doubt that there will be a crash. It may not be the 50+% we've seen the past few times, but it will definitely be more than 20%.
OP was urging people to be cautious and not invest more than they can afford. Always great advice.

Cavirtex is what you're looking for. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:49:39
Good. And no surprises either. this will make it much easier for me at tax time.

Dude, pay a pilot to fly you to an island that has no government. Problem solved, no passport required. The only reason you need a passport is so you can get back in. You don't want to be in. So there's no problem. 
You guys are all just being cheapskates. You made the money because of the taxes other people paid, now it's your turn. Yes, you even have to thank the NSA . I'm not saying you have to take it all sitting down, but you do have to pay your taxes, because they got you where you are. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:13:34
Hindsight is 20/20. Don't believe everything you hear on the internet. Reality is, you may have missed out on money, but you made the right choice. Invest in what you believe in. Think about how you would feel if you're invested $4000 and the value went to &lt;$1. Pretty bad, eh? So seriously, stop kicking yourself.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:10:12
Credit card? Yikes. Why would you buy on credit? Who's going to let you buy on credit? Have you looked at what your credit card company is going to charge you for buying currency? I bet it's more than you think.
Calm down, wait for cavirtex (that is who you're going through, right?) to verify, and then buy. Or go through localbitcoins if you're that desperate.

It will take a while if we keep having these crazy swings.
As long as the average daily variability is above 8%, I'm not using my coins.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:18:48
Yes, the most important one: PAY YOUR TAX!
edit: more importantly, put aside money so that you will be able to pay the tax come that time.
@_date: 2013-10-26 14:03:26
No, you have the wrong idea about how bases work. A is eleven in some bases (because we do not have a normal, non-base-ten character for that) (edit: was wrong. it's ten, but the rest stands). He did not say "10 in base ten", he said 10 in base 10. That is correct. two is "10" in base two, and four hundred is "10" in base four hundred. In other words, 10 is "10" in base 10, and 10 is "10" in base 10.

Honestly, if it dropped $2 I would actually use it for spending. Right now, it keeps going up, which means I shouldn't spend it, because it will be worth more tomorrow. Now, if it's $2 and growing, there's the same problem, but that seems unlikely in the next while, doesn't it?
Not wanting to spend coins is the problem with the current boom.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:20:55
Yeah, it's called everyone, and we're all welcome to leave. There's plenty of islands in the middle of the ocean that you can go inhabit. I'll donate even $150 to help someone do it, as long as they're done being a parasite on society and therefore me forever.

Fellow Canadian. You go through Vogogo. On the Cavirtex site, you enter how much you want to deposit. It adds a $5 fee, and Vogogo sends you an email with an invoice for the full amount. They also provide a online bill payment account number. You go to your online banking, add Vogogo as a bill to pay, and put in the account number from the email. You then pay the bill like you would your credit card or electricity bill. 2.5 days later, the money is in your Cavirtex account.

If someone moves a few coins lots of times, it can look like a lot of volume. Bitcoin days gets rid of this noise.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:11:15
Sell them for cash. Just make sure that while doing so, you do not take roads, breathe clean air, take public transit, cross any bridges, use any utility lines, or believe that you will not be shot by those crazy canadian invaders. Oh, and make sure that everything you do does not involve the internet. Or the SHA-256 algorithm. Wait a second...
Or, you could just be an adult and pay the taxes that you owe, which have contributed to the money you made.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:08:38
Would you have been? Probably not. You would have sold earlier and cashed in your gains. I would have. I did. I can't believe how many times I'm saying this today, but hindsight is 20/20. If someone were to drop $50k into bitcoin today and it crashed to $0.20 tomorrow, they'd be crying at their desk too.
You cannot change the past.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:29:16
Yup. You (and I) didn't make as much money as we could have, but we also didn't lose everything. Better safe than sorry.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:16:46
cavirtex is a great exchange, and it's nice to keep your money in Canada to avoid tax complications (made that mistake before, fortunately with a small amount. Let me post to you what I just posted elsewhere:
"Hindsight is 20/20. Don't believe everything you hear on the internet. Reality is, you may have missed out on money, but you made the right choice. Invest in what you believe in.

Smarter than the people missing the joke. Personally, I liked it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:38:19
I thought I was a dumbass for the way I entered my trade earlier (below 715, sell for 675), but turns out it was a good idea... for now.
cavirtex has been having trouble all day, which is why I did that. Big risk, when the platform won't work when you need it.
