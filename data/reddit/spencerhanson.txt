This is so awesome! A huge thanks to all those involved.
I'm setting up my store now. For some reason I can't set my currency to USD, just BTC. When I try to set another currency, all of my searches come up empty. Anybody else running into this? What might I have done wrong?

I guess you could call the goal wealth, but I don't think that quite captures it. I like to think of the goal of Bitcoin to be cooperation. An efficient, ubiquitous, p2p transactions network enables cooperation. We can exchange, specialize, trade, delegate, contract, barter, fund, borrow, loan, transact, and gift in new and exciting ways. The result, probably, is wealth, but the goal is cooperation, I'd say.

I am familiar with cold storage basics. But spending from cold storage via Electrum confuses me. Doesn't the change get sent to a separate address? So if I have 10,000 bits in cold storage address 123 and spend 1000, don't the 9,000 remaining bits get moved to a different address? 
Yeah, I guess I just need to read up on this more.

Nice idea to focus tipping around charities on Twitter. I think a clear purpose for the tipping makes the impact more recognizable.

I agree, but don't you think it is ignorant theft, as opposed to malicious theft? Sure, ignorance isn't the loveliest of qualities, but I think enlightenment comes one line at a time. These quotes are relevant:  
"We're standing on the shoulders of giants."  
"Hate the rules of the game, not the players. "  
It's probably not helpful to vilify an age group. Open discussion toward further enlightenment sounds good to me.

I don't follow politics because I think it's a waste of time, but Ron Paul would be an example of what I'm referring to.  He took a clearly anti-status quo position against the FED and gained a lot of support for it.  Other politicians are now following suit.  
Bitcoin is just now stepping into the spotlight, but I expect it will be something the anti-FED, political crowd would be attracted to.

For anybody curious, I use WooCommerce for [my site]( I highly recommend it.
* WooThemes = Canvas
* WooCommerce plugin
* Bitcoin plugin for WooCommerce
Customers can click on the Bitcoin payment option at checkout. The Bitcoin plugin automatically converts to BTC at the current exchange ratio, creates a new address, and waits for payment. When payment is made the BTC are automatically relayed to my personal wallet through the Blockchain API. 
Really intuitive and easy. I have no programming ability at all. Lots of good tutorials out there which got me going.

If BTC goes to $1000, everybody's life will change.

Sure. I used a Wordpress plugin called [Bitcoin Payments for WooCommerce](

I think the government attempts to regulate Bitcoin will result very much like their attempts to regulate the internet so far.  
The government would also love to regulate the internet, but too many people like the internet and screamed "get your damn hands off our internet, you suck!" (PIPA and SOPA)
People like their money too, and I expect the general sentiment will be an overwhelming "get your damn hands off our money, you suck!"  (e.g. Cyprus, etc.)  For this to happen though, people will have to understand Bitcoin.  The faster we spread the word, the better.

The number 1 news item world wide is the struggling economy.  Very different people, from very different backgrounds are all looking for answers to the same financial problems that now plague the globe.  The problem is corrupt banking.  The answer is Bitcoin.  
Whether you're a far right Tea Party member, a far left Occupy Wall Street participant, a self-employed business man, a poor laborer, a European saver, or a Chinese manufacturer, once you understand Bitcoin, you know it's the answer you've been looking for.
Bitcoin's value is directly related to the number of people who see it's value.  It's easier to see Bitcoin's value as more people see Bitcoin's value.  This is the network effect.

I've never really caught the vision of Ripple.  The idea seems to be that it could operate as a p2p exchange, and you'd only move your money through people you trust (or people your people trust).

@_date: 2013-04-10 04:21:37
[This guy]( is probably doing alright for himself!
@_date: 2013-07-12 22:15:18
Yeah, I'll see if i can explain better. 
My rewards will be printed books. I need to raise $7,700 worth to make rewards happen. If the combined pledges, USD + Bitcoin, come to at least $7,700, I'm golden and can get all the backers their rewards. 
The problem is if I set a BitcoinStarter funding goal for, say, $100, I run the risk of funding on BitcoinStarter, but falling short of my total funding goal of $7,700. This situation would put me accountable for rewards to BitcoinStarter backers but without any books to give.  That's why I asked about 2 conditions for Bitcoin pledges, to also make sure the total funding goal is reached.
The ability to bolt a BitcoinStarter onto a Kickstarter by setting this "total-funding conditional", would be perfect. What I would do is create a BitcoinStarter parallel project and set a Bitcoin funding goal of say 1 BTC and then check a box that this BitcoinStarter was complimentary to a parallel Kickstarter project. I would then paste a link for my running Kickstarter project into the BitcoinStarter project so that BitcoinStarter could see my Kickstarter funding progress. If the Kickstarter and BitcoinStarter funding projects both reach their funding goals, then the BitcoinStarter project funds.
Make sense?

It seems to me this is still a conservative estimate.  It's like estimating the internet's 2013 daily bandwidth requirements based on stagnant 1985 bandwidth requirements.  Such a guess would certainly look laughably low today because the internet has spurred the creation of huge amounts of new kinds of information that didn't exist in 1985.
Similarly, a currency that enables global cooperation as never before witnessed in human history has the potential to spur the creation of huge amounts of new kinds of wealth, markets, and capital that do not exist today.  
Saying today that Bitcoin is chasing a $60 trillion global market is probably like saying in 1985 that the Internet was chasing a 200 TB daily information bandwidth.  
Disruptive technologies disrupt.  My guess is that this $60 trillion global GDP will seem like chump change once Bitcoin really enables global cooperation and unleashes the world's suppressed potential.

BTC loans don't need to be a terrible idea.  Yes, deflation makes repayment far more difficult, but there are still plenty of circumstances where a loan could benefit both parties.  I admit it's a tad melodramatic, but money in the right place at the right time can save lives.  
I strongly believe that Bitcoin's awesome capacity to move capital around the world will be a key driver for dramatic increases in quality of living for people who have never before had an opportunity to catch a break for building a better life.  A small loan can make a huge difference.

Governments are just people.  Remember, most people in governments have a lot to gain by using Bitcoin, just as you and I do.  There are few powerful special interests that stand threatened by Bitcoin, and the best chance Bitcoin has against these powerful special interests is to integrate Bitcoin into as many people's lives as possible, as soon as possible.  That includes people in government, it would seem.  I think the best way to convince people of the benefits of voluntary solutions, like Bitcoin, are to let them taste it for themselves, even if they currently work for the state.

Human productive capacity is severely limited right now by ineffective and corrupt banking practices.  Just as the Internet unleashed human potential by enabling information to freely move, Bitcoin will also unleash vast reserves of yet untapped human potential by enabling global exchange and cooperation.  Nothing creates wealth as quickly and dramatically as specialization and trade.  Bitcoin enables the world to work together as never before.
As more people internalize the astounding benefits of Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin necessarily goes up because of limited supply (if 10% of the world had $100 in Bitcoins, the price of Bitcoin would be ~$3,333 USD).

For now I just enabled bitcoin pledges manually on my website, [here](
What I would have loved is the option to create a parallel BitcoinStarter project to compliment my Kickstarter project that handles all the backers, comments, pledges, updates, etc for me, like Kickstarter.   
Imagine if it were as simple as pasting in the link of my Kickstart project and verifying that the Kickstarter project really is mine. BitcoinStarter could then scrape all the information it needs to autofill the project with all the details already provided to Kickstarter - project description, images, rewards, video links, etc. Then I'd look through it and polish it up a bit and submit it. Bitcoin pledges could come rolling in conditional on the Kickstarter successfully funding. 
It would be up to the project owner to decide how they wanted to manage funding goals in this scenario. I'd probably lower my Kickstarter funding goal a bit in anticipation of getting some backing in Bitcoin. Or maybe I'd keep the same funding goal and consider the Bitcoin backing the frosting on top.
@_date: 2013-03-01 03:02:07
Back in 1995 you could have argued that the internet wasn't going to change the world as the crazy visionaries claimed, because if it could, it already would have.  You would have been wrong.
Remember those email skeptics that didn't see the value of email because, after all, who would send you email if you were one of 5 people using email?  
Bitcoin's success, like email's, is tied to the community adopting it.  People must shifting their previous assumptions about money.  This shift takes time.  Soon Bitcoin will be as much a part of life as email.  
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:12:38
The 2-3% credit card charges are devastating on slim retail margins.  Accepting Bitcoin could nearly double Amazon's profits.  I'd say that's a persuasive incentive.  I imagine legal uncertainty is probably a big hurdle at the moment, but with services like BitPay, the legal risks are largely  mitigated.  
Amazon coins will still be purchased through credit cards, right?  So no advantage there.
EDIT:  In other words, Bitcoin has a huge value proposition for lots of people.  I think we can count on greed to drive Bitcoin mainstream.  Sure, there will be plenty of big interests intent on killing Bitcoin (PayPal, Banks, government, etc), but there will be even more interests intent on embracing it and making it thrive.  There will be plenty of special interests lobbying government to "stop the evil Bitcoin," but there will be even more screaming "get your damn hands off my money!"

I think a cell phone payment platform, like an M-Pesa for Bitcoin, is the key to making this happen.  
* Donators want to be sure their donations are going directly into the hands of people and projects they care about.
* The recipients need to easily receive the money in remote areas with limited infrastructure.
* The recipients need to easily spend the money within their community, so it should be easy for anybody with a cell phone to use.
You could have a website, like Kickstarter, where people and teams introduce themselves and their projects.  Here the funding and donation progress for people and projects could be monitored in an accountable, entertaining, inspiring way as the world looks on at the creative energy of real things happening through this virtual currency.  
You could have teams of volunteers traveling to exotic places meeting eager people hungry for opportunity and they could make videos to share the stories of these people with the world.  It could easily be it's own reality tv series on YouTube with several or dozens of teams following different stories around the world simultaneously.
Donators could become involved in the lives of these people via video, text, skype, chat, beyond just blindly throwing money over a fence.  Friendships could be made.  Stronger communities could be built, locally and globally.  
Can you picture it?

The world didn't need tulip bulbs.  The world does need a sound, global currency.  
Bitcoin's value comes through enabling global cooperation and exchange.  Bitcoin will enable the human race across the globe to cooperate like never before, dissolving many of the artificially imposed barriers that exist today.  Great wealth is waiting to be unlocked through the power of global specialization and cooperation.
Money is the blood of an economy.  Right now the economy is anemic.  Bitcoin is the cure. 
EDIT:  Also, currency is a 100% confidence game.  It's true that most of the volume involves currency trading, but that's the only way it can be in the beginning of a new currency.
Bitcoin's rise to general use is expected to be volatile because nobody knows for sure if they can confide in Bitcoin.  The fundamentals are there for making it a strong currency, but everybody else has to agree.  Nobody is commanded to use Bitcoin like we are commanded to use the dollar.  We can only hope that others will see Bitcoin's value as well.  It takes time for a paradigm shift to mature, especially one as emotionally involved as money.

I see the point you're driving at.  It's important to understand that environmentalism is a luxury.  It's hard to care about burning Brazilian cherry when you're freezing to death.  An overabundance of wealth that lets us turn our attention from survival to efficiency to sustainability is the only path to saving the planet.  
I agree that sustainability is not the always the first place people turn when they stumble into an overabundance of wealth, but that is the increasing trend.

Yeah, I've seen you on there :).
It's a bummer because Bitcoin's amazing capacity for capital mobility could really benefit a lot of people. Just as micro-loans have benefitted thousands (maybe millions) in India and other poverty-stricken places, small loans enabled by Bitcoin could make big improvements in many lives all around the world.  Platforms like BTCJam could enable this.

Good point well taken.  As a matter of fact, I'm living in Costa Rica now :)

Good reminder.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-05 02:41:50
Right.  That makes sense.  Thanks.  
So then, the concern is not that the price rises "too quickly" by some textbook definition/calculation (i.e. RSI), but that the price rises faster than the market is willing to bear (i.e. too many speculative investors poised to sell, insufficient infrastructure and support, etc).

Yeah, this is the classic criticism again Bitcoin, that it is deflationary and encourages hoarding. This is an easy problem for the market to solve by discounting prices to encourage spending. Maybe it's 5%. Maybe it's 50%. Markets are good at this sort of problems solving.

Do you see the value of Bitcoin besides that the price is going up?  Do you understand why there would be a demand for Bitcoin?  I think for anybody that understands Bitcoin, the answer to your question is simple.

Yes I do.  Should I not have an 'authority figure problem?'  Is it your argument that I should welcome the dictates of a master on how I shall or shall not peacefully cooperate with other free men?  What virtue is there in pretending like he is above myself or my neighbor?

Have you considered an ipo to raise funds?  Selling some shares on BitFunder or something would get you the capital you need quick.  There is certainly a market for this kind of service.  If you do it now, and do it well, you'll be sitting very pretty, and so will Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-09 03:39:26

And the street scum doesn't have the nerve to pretend like he's doing you a favor.
Bitcoin makes boostrapping easier, as you pointed out, and raising capital easier.  Fast and easy access to capital through platforms such as BitFunder and BTCJam have ridiculously exciting implications for building new wealth.  
The faster we can close the loop on Bitcoin acceptance, the better since government regulation relies on the USD&lt;-&gt;BTC choke point.

What do you think the best approach would be for setting up a parallel funding project?  I don't want to set the bitcoin funding goal too low and be on the hook to send rewards to bitcoin backers if my main Kickstarter goal doesn't fund. At the same time, I don't want to set the goal too high, completely disconnected from the complimentary funding coming in from Kickstarter.
[edit] is there a way to add 2 conditionals to the bitcoin pledges? 1- the bitcoin funding goal is reached. 2- the total funding goal is reached.

I feel you have missed an important point of why $100 worth of BTC is worth more than $100 worth of a traditional currency. 
Bitcoin has the added value of being able to effortlessly move anywhere in the world. This unprecedented level of capital mobility is worth a lot, especially if you're a guy trying to get $10,000 worth of cash on a plane, or bank wired out of China or Cyprus.

You assume greed is a bad thing.  It is greed that drives people to serve others with cool goods and services.  Greed for happiness, or recognition, or money.  Greed is good.  Only when pursued violently is greed bad.  In the free market greed is good.  
I wish more people would be passionately greedy and offer me awesome goods and services in hopes that I might want to pay them.

Sure, Bitcoin may go down, and I may lose out, but I don't think so. I believe in Bitcoin as a payment platform.
* Open-source and decentralized.
* Voluntarily accepted on a global scale. No arbitrary dividing lines, just cooperation for whoever wants it, no matter where they live.
* Founded on principles of sound money.
Everyday we make bets and take risks. Bitcoin is a bet I can believe in because it's founded on first principles.
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:44:13
The price would skyrocket before a tycoon could get their hands on too many Bitcoins.  As they started to buy, the price would start to climb, and more people would hold onto their bitcoins in anticipation of the continued climb.  The timid speculators would sell off, but those who understand Bitcoin and who are in it for the long term would and will continue to hold.
(I don't mean to say that Bitcoin believers would or should never spend their coins.  Spending coins is good.  I think the best practice is to spend coins on whatever you need to buy and immediately replenish your coin supply.)

It seems you contradict yourself.  You shouldn't be shaky about selling right now if you believe the price has risen too fast to be sustainable.

No, saving Bitcoins helps the Bitcoin economy.  The first stage for a nascent currency must necessarily be a saving/hoarding stage. 
A currency in only valuable if other people think it's valuable.  The market determines how valuable Bitcoin is by seeing how many people are willing to hold onto it.
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:55:15
Good to hear.  Thanks!

Looking closely at the two opposing sides of this Bubble Battle, I would agree there is a bubble about to pop, but which side is the bubble?  
Where is the trust artificially high?  Is it with the emerging mathematically controlled, open-source currency now being voluntarily adopted for it's merits as well-designed system of exchange?  Or is it with the politically controlled fiat currencies whose systems are crumbling around in avalanches of debt and unsustainability?
I agree Bitcoin's skyrocketing price is unnerving, but taking a rational look at the fundamentals involved it would seem the bubble is in fiat currencies which are proving to not deserve the levels of confidence they have enjoyed so far.  
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:06:02
Bitcoin should be looking might appealing to Cypriots right about now!
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:29:29
I generally agree with you.  However, I'm guessing there will be politicians happy to embrace Bitcoin as the "people's currency" and make it part of their platform to take advantage of the growing anti-banking/anti-debt sentiment and earn some votes.
So yes, I agree that most people in governments will likely strive to maintain the status quo, but it would also seem there will be politicians willing to challenge it and rise up the hero. As Bitcoin gains market penetration, politicians will have increasing pressure to champion Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-18 15:46:03
It may be too late for Cypriots to move their money before "contributing" to their first "bailout," but it's not too late to move it into Bitcoin before the next.
The first Cypriots to get MtGox verified to buy lots of coins and resell those coins on the street for a markup could be doing pretty well for themselves, I'd imagine.

He gets so many things wrong.
* He calls Bitcoin 'fiat.'  Obviously he has not looked up 'fiat' in a dictionary or he has had scary dreams of aliens forcing him to transact in Bitcoin.
* He asserts there is absolutely nothing valuabe about Bitcoin.  Obviously he's never tried to send money out of China.
* He's positive the crash will come since he's incapable of understanding Bitcoin.  Obviously he hasn't noticed the countries of the world racing to out-inflate each other.
