I looked into it. I actually really liked monero but wish it had a true hard cap like bitcoin, and a fixed blocksize. I know its used for lost coins and paying miners but if they had a fixed blocksize, fees can pay the miners. But without a fixed cap then its better to store in Bitcoin but convert to monero to transact.

But the entertainment industry cant stop the file from propagating. All the new movies are still available.  No one can destroy that file unless it's destroyed on every single computer that has it. And Users can torrent through vpn that encrypts the data. They cant even hand over information even if forced.
 Bitcoin nodes dont try to hide their data now but it can be run through tor if need be. 
With bitcoin, new miners in other countries will take the reward until marginal cost = marginal revenue. It's just a protocol to stay on one shared history for a file, with the network just sending information done in 1s and 0s. A government would have to cut the cables for the worlds internet to stop users from sending information. And even then Bitcoin is just a protocol. We can use radio, smoke signals, and even emojis to relay information.
And if the worst to bitcoin happens, we can fork the project. Bitcoin is anti fragile and they know its futile to try. Every other money substitute has been taken down quickly because the government wants to keep its monopoly on the business of money making. Also if your government is doing such acts against humanity you need to consider that it's your government that is corrupt.
The only way to take out bitcoin is to make a better one. Bitcoin has these advantages that fiat now doesnt have. It's a more democratic. No central rulers.  All participants can validate the ledger and does not need to trust anyone. Might be hard for politicians to justify their spending when its all transparent to the public. Adoption is not forced on anyone and is done through voluntary belief. Bitcoin has a hard limit. Fiat needs to be created to pay off debts from creating more fiat units. Never will have a hard cap. Also with settlements bitcoin is faster. Chargeback can occur months later so that money isnt really yours. If the blockchain has the record of you owning the funds (and enough confirmations to be safe from regular reorganizations that can happen) then its yours and no one can take your funds without your permission. Also Bitcoin doesn't close after 5 pm nor for holidays. The workers get paid in bitcoin for securing the network. Difficulty in finding a valid block can decrease to cpu and even pen and paper if really dire.

Honestly, I like their vision of Bitcoin. Even though I use the USD feature it makes sense. However, I only use the feature to compare to something im used to never really to send, for example, $50 since there are different conversion rates. When I think about it, I always send what the merchant asks in the bitcoin field and never in the fiat field. Bitcoin will eventually stop being compared to fiat like how Americans don't think about the dollar in terms of bolivars. Slow adoption of Samourai may happen because of this but leaving it in will definitely slow adoption.

A public storage facility (compared to q public ledger) seems like it will cost everyone a shit ton in fees.

Miners must sell.
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:22:21
Wouldn't it be greater because to they need to buy Asics for the 51% (which already is stupidly expensive because it just does one thing and that is worthless if Bitcoin bitcoin exist) + electricity as you said, + land. But they make no money mining blocks unless they mine 100 with that electricity because they can't spend the coinbase reward untill after 100 blocks.
 So they start off vastly already negative because they can't even buy the machines to pull this off, and bleed money for 100 blocks just to double spend one transaction. Literally they would've made money using their 51% to mine blocks.
They can't just sit still on 51% because of difficulty adjustment. They must reinvest profits to expand to maintain 51% hashrate. 
All this wasted money to redo one block of  transactions. And when Bitcoin is "dead" they can't recoup their cost of Asics because it can't do anything else and the electricity had already been lost. Meanwhile people would rather have a hardfork than to lose everything and a new chain is started. Will take years to rebuild but at least the attacker has to earn new money to attack the new network.

It's trustless peer to peer to peer transactions in my opinion. Like a network of digital abicuses (abici?). 
Wait those protocol are compatible with the internet  though and not intranet for example. Intranet can adopt the technology but they are still two different networks. It's like you can't send litecoin to Bitcoin wallet so you must atomic swap it to use bitcoin. Only Bitcoin works with the Bitcoin network. Right now altcoins are fighting each other for 2nd seat to fight Bitcoin to be the base layer. They aren't working on Bitcoin compatible protocols.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:52:12
But eventually it goes back to 10 minutes on average, with other miners profiting and they will lose money (opportunity cost and the machines they have cost money). Doesn't matter where the miners are, they don't control the network. They can work by ordering transactions and for doing so will be rewarded in Bitcoin. So is it centralized if you kill the miners and Bitcoin keeps on working?

@_date: 2019-11-21 13:17:54
Wait what. If a bad actor changes the rules and mines on a chain to produce a more accumulated hashrate chain, he would be paying the price to mine Bitcoin but generating a different token that's worth less than Bitcoin. The incentive structure that has always existed with Bitcoin prevents this. Technically not longest chain but the chain with the most accumulated proof of work had always been Bitcoin. Remember segwit2x with 95% hash rate? If they mine a different chain than the one the majority, they would be spending more money than the token they would generate. 


Refer to my example in cases of forks. Bitcoin cant have 1,000 forks without their being 1,000 x the hashrate of one chain. 999 of those forks would bankrupt themselves if they tried to keep up with the main chain.
In pos, there's no sacrifice of something finite. 1000 forks where people uses ownership of coins, still poses the problem of not knowing which chain is the true chain without a central party. 
 
Go to point 1. He explains it better than I can. Pow works because something finite is used to 'create' something finite but digitally. This helps with Bitcoin being digitally scarce. There is only one chain with the most accumulated pow. POS doesn't have an anchor to the real world like this to ensure digital scarcity. It has to rely on humans.

Copy paste here because they send you to Twitter first.
1. Improved Access to BankingThe first factor that helped cryptocurrencies garner a huge success is the simplicity and ease of access they provide general population to the banking.The World Bank estimation tells that more than two billion people around the world don’t have access to banking services. There are many reasons, most of which have come from poverty. But, the most significant is that these people have improper access to the Global Commerce. That’s where cryptocurrency and its development services come into play.There are now many applications that enable users to access a cryptocurrency wallet and use it for banking and investing, even from their mobile devices. Mobile devices have increased in developing countries more rapidly than banking services. That’s the reason cryptocurrency development services are flourishing in those countries as they provide crypto mobile app development services as well.2.  Increased TransparencyOut of all the obstacles that hinder the development of developing countries the most persistent are the lack of transparency in the financial system and corruption in governance. Improper bureaucracy and corruption expand the ever-growing gap between the rich and the poor.Above that, the money issued for the public interest doesn’t reach to the masses on a regular basis.The blockchain technology that bolsters the cryptocurrency development comes with technology that makes corruption nearly impossible. The blockchain refers to as an immutable ledger where every transaction history on the network get stored and recorded using cryptography, which is one of the safest ways for securing anything on the internet. It means every transaction is public on a distributed or shared ledger and nobody can alter that.Thus, the increased level of transparency makes suspicious activities hard to go unnoticed, while also allowing users to conduct safe transactions.3. Increased Greater Social MobilityIn spite of being called stereotype; another game for the riches only, cryptocurrency offers a new way to global income equality.One of the setbacks to social mobility in developing countries is corruption. However, as we mentioned, the issue is being tackled ferociously by cryptocurrency development services and the blockchain technology services.It’s because unlike conventional banking, in crypto banking, there’s no requirement for any physical presence at any specific location. In layman’s words, you require an internet connection and a cryptocurrency wallet.Looking to develop a cryptocurrency wallet, we might trigger a business query.Cryptocurrencies are a great way to provide people with accessibility, clarity, and transparency, the most important three things that often fall short in supply in developing countries.Conclusion:Cryptocurrency Development in developing countries is offering an alternative solution to the problems that come with traditional banking services.These alternatives have spanned to countries of all levels that seek economic development. With above-mentioned points, it’s clear that developing countries should strive more to make use of cryptocurrency to improve their finance system, if not everything.

The line of thinking is more: once 1:1 Bitcoin:USD price parity was broken, USD inflates more than Bitcoin and must continually print more to pay off the interests from printing money etc , so by supply and demand Bitcoin will become more valuable as the dollar loses value. Similar to how 1 dollar is like 11 million bolivars. You wouldn't trade the dollar for the bolivars because it's shit money that is hyperinflated. 1 Bitcoin is 6000 dollars. And when recessions come from over inflated dollars, you wouldn't want to hold onto the money that is less scarce.

All coins have to have fees though if it is to  remain decentralized. The block chain is a public ledger that anyone can write to. If free everyone can spam to the point it's not possible to have a copy of the ledger without being a data center. At the end of the day the block chain is a public resource and must be responsibly (fees paid for) used.
 Nano lets everyone have free transactions but that let's users send back and forth to themselves ad infinitum. It can't stop spam with zero fees. You can't have an increase in adoption without an increase in fees if you ultimately cannot sacrifice decentralization.
And fees are low on any coin that isn't used. If any coin had bitcoins volume, whole being as decentralized, it must also increase it's fees.

From my understanding, there's no absolute certainty of trustlessness. You always need an authority to tell you the true chain. Pow does away with people, you can trust the true history is the one with the most pow. 
 Without sacrificing something finite in real life, how can software tell you which chain is the true chain? It can't. You must rely on people to not lie to you. 
An extreme thought experiment: there's a coin that uses pos/dpos/orv/ or any derivative. Everyone forks and changes one consensus rule to make it incompatible with each other but decides to keep the name. In 200 years how can a kid know which is the true chain amongst 1,000,000 chains with the same name? Activity can be gamed and you can't tell if one person is sending money around pretending to have adoption. "No, trust me this is the true chain don't listen to others," as said by everyone... Medium articles and people will lie to you in this environment. Without sacrificing something in real life, you must trust a person. At that point it's no better than trusting a banker and asking him what's your current balance. 
Also there's the issue of initial issuance. Without mining, all the coins are created out of thin air (for free) by one central figure. They literally typed a number into a keyboard. You must trust this creator to be fair and to give to everyone on Earth equally. They never do and will give some to themselves (also in secret accounts because no one can tell they didn't do it). 
Pow mimics gold. If you want to spend energy/money looking for it, go for it. The more energy/money you spend the more you'll find. Even Satoshi had to waste energy looking for it. And with the difficulty adjustment, he can't even mine Bitcoin that is reserved for the year 2140. Heck, he couldn't have even mined 17 million bitcoins without the difficulty of bitcoin's hashrate today and he is still limited to 10 minute blocks with a difficulty adjustment that ensures 17 million Bitcoin will exist in this year and not sooner. 
I'm probably missing other stuff.

You said crashing to zero. Gold changes in value.
And I think gold sucks at everything else. Heavy, expensive, no adoption compared to Bitcoin because no one has the equipment needed to verify authenticity with no trust in others, can't buy things on the internet nor can one do microtransactions. If you thought Bitcoin fees were bad, imagine how much gold you lose to send it globally. Also less (real, not paper) liquidity because it is just so slow to move, so when you do sell at one of those gold stores (which are sparse), they tax you even more with a greater exchange rate. So if you were to store gold and sell it back for fiat, that is like a day long process. That's just depending on what you have. And the money you lose makes it so unbearable that I would hate to deal with storing value in gold.
Don't get me wrong, gold is cool... to buy Bitcoin with. It helped with the logic of what money is, but I don't want to use the same money as those in the Roman empire. They got debased with other metals because no one can verify the gold. It has been how long? Gold being mainstream won't happen. It has its chance and time and time again people would rather deal with receipts than the actual rock (atom, I know).

The more apt comparison would be an animal dying from natural old age. It was going to die anyways. It's a waste if we just watch it die and decompose. Might as well eat it.

Not everybody is a bch supporter. That sub is just a couple people as sockpuppets. Bch has sub 200 kb blocksizes. It has no adoption. And technologically superior by increasing blocksize limit? What's stopping someone from forking and increasing blocksize to 1 gb and making it better? Then someone forks to 2gb? There goes digital scarcity. If one coin supplants Bitcoin then another can supplant that. The whole experiment fails.

Decentralization comes from who can validate (nodes) and if a government were to attack a central location to bring it down. Go ahead and kill the whales and big miners. Bitcoin lives on because it is more decentralized. Which coins do you think is more decentralized in that it would be harder to bring down?
Security comes from how much it costs to roll back X blocks. Which coin cost more to roll back?

How can they verify its real good? Listen gold's cool, for buying Bitcoin. But in reality gold is not coming back like we're in some serfdom era. It had its chance, and time has proven gold is too cumbersome to transact and people will accept paper receipts than to deal with the headaches of gold.

Seems like bch right now has a planned forced upgrade built in. Bitcoin abc wants to add something that's not fully tested that helps big blocks propagate but still is a consensus change. BitcoinSV is faketoshi's claim of being the real Bitcoin with 128mb change and some different op codes. But he'll most likely won't deliver anything (funny because Satoshi coded the first client) and just fork bitcoinabc and change the name and read.me. some people think faketoshi is Satoshi so they say bitcoinSV(satoahi's vision) more aligns with Bitcoin and would be the true Bitcoin. Bitcoinabc says it doesn't matter since **theirs**is more like satoshi's vision and should be Bitcoin. Really just helps the image that visions is a stupid, subjective way to determine the chain name and hashrate is an objective measurement. So props to faketoshi for once.
most likely bitcoinabc chain will win since bitmain backs that one and he has 1
 million bch he can dump.
Tldr: an altcoin that has 60kb average blocksizes dilutes itself even more. This is good for Bitcoin (Bitcoin).

Yeah. Other coins fade away if their marketing dies down. And every alt coin has a central point of attack. Is community support big enough that they will work for free? 
Just wondering, do you think Bitcoin can be taken over? Personally, I don't think it can. But I would love to hear a point of view I may be missing.
And node count helps with decentralization. But security comes in the form of costs. The attacker must be willing to forgo 12.5 Bitcoin plus fees for altering one block and he must mine 100 blocks to be able to spend that one block. Then the attacker must also be willing to burn his investment  since Asics  can  only be  used for sha-256. It costs more to attack Bitcoin because Bitcoin is worth a lot more.  The attacket realizes with his hashrate that he would rather earn money than burn it.

How? The profit for miners is hash/electricity cost. They can't hash anymore without upgrading hardware so they find cheaper electricity. And at power plants, dams, etc they can't convert all energy into stored energy for later. It's just a physical limit that exists. It is literally being wasted already. Bitcoin miners would seek these places and consume the energy that wouldnt have made it anywhere in the first place.

Pos uses software to tell if software is correct or not. That makes it difficult to know the real chain just by using software in a decentralized network.
Pow helps stay in consensus because an external finite source needs to be wasted to see which chain is the correct one. That's the reason why POS isn't implemented in any serious coin today. I don't see a computer science solving sentience any time soon.

What can miners do besides order transactions? Could miners increase the block reward from 12.5 to 100 bitcoins? Could they take funds that aren't theirs? Sure, but it won't be Bitcoin and won't be worth what Bitcoin is worth. 
They can't change rules. If miners control Bitcoin how come segwit2x and bcash aren't Bitcoin? Consensus comes from full nodes, both mining and non mining. How are miners in control again?

I'm not familiar but these are ip address protocols? So are you saying that on chain transactions will one day be infeasible and that most transactions will happen off chain because everyone will move offchain? Will we move off IPv4 completely or will there always be a need for IPv4?

Blocks have to get full if one day miners only mine for the transaction fees. There's no point in paying transaction fees if blocks are never full since everyone can make it in.

Well is it? How many results do you have?
@_date: 2018-10-18 01:18:48
Yeah but that's why you save in hard money and when you need to, buy soft money to pay for stuff. In the Bitcoin standard, the author accounts how gold was used to buy up all resources when the people used glass beads as money. It's really no different. It's easy to buy a softer money because it is printed in excess when you have harder money.

Eli5? I thought futures help bring a more accurate price discovery.
@_date: 2018-10-25 21:36:05
But when it hits physical limits the only thing that can change for profitability is lowering energy costs. And I don't get why manufacturers would part with a money making machine if they can make money off of it. I don't think centralization of mining is bad. It's a cut throat business that must reinvest profits to an ever growing hashrate difficulty. I mean it's centralized now and the system still works out for the users of the system.
@_date: 2018-10-18 13:04:04
Yeah it's cut throat. They must keep reinvesting or cutting electricity costs. And when they so those things it increases difficulty. Rinse repeat.
@_date: 2018-10-18 12:18:50
Doesn't the attacking chain also have to be check for difficulty adjustments? Like if he makes too many blocks too quickly it should also get harder for him to make blocks right?
@_date: 2018-10-17 09:48:55
Ledger has a secure element that is closed sourced. Trezor 1 is open sourced software AND hardware.

This seems like an attack vector. What if people didn't upgrade because they are busy and want to fully audit before they upgrade? A malicious actor could do this to force people to a bad version.
@_date: 2018-10-21 14:32:30
$30 is not in terms of Bitcoin which at the time was worth a lot more ~ $19,000. Fees are in terms of sat/byte. Every coin isn't used as much as Bitcoin and fees will increase on those chains too if used with the same volume.
@_date: 2018-10-23 20:04:08
Any attack is good for Bitcoin. Bitcoin needs to be attack socially as well.
@_date: 2018-10-21 14:34:32
Okay but I wouldn't upgrade. Others won't as well since bcash tried and no one followed. You'll just be making another bcash altcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-02 03:28:35
What about now? More places accept bitcoin than gold lol. Gold has hundreds of years to be mainstream adopted. It ends up in banks with paper receipts because people hate dealing with it. It's heavy, you'd have to test it, cumbersome to pay for microtransactions, and the fees to send it with armed guards across the world means it can't adapt to the current global marketplace. Also I buy more things online than in stores. Gold sucks.

The 12/24 words + password (which acts as the 13th/25th word). You have me worried. But as long as you have the seed secured you should be fine. If you lose your phone you can restore to any Bitcoin wallet. Keep it secured and have multiple copies. Maybe don't write down the password (but you need it to see your funds if you import to another wallet).  The send/receive tab should be intuitive.

I can answer that girl's question  in. Those people don't represent Bitcoin. No one does, that's the point. Stop looking for authority figures when non exists. Don't "invest" in Bitcoin to make more Fiat. You don't need to be convinced to put money in. Buy it if you need it. For things only sold in Bitcoin or your country's money loses value harder than Bitcoin. 
Criticisms on the video: he literally asked why is a housekeeper doing on the ship. This video just shows why the cruise was pointless. 
Criticisms on the cruise: seems like a money grab with ads. Bitcoin doesn't need marketing. It's a protocol that can be used in dire situations. Marketing is needed for pump n dumps. Real development/discussions happen in front of a computer. It seems weird that they have pretty girls to beauty up the boat when the answer of why you are here is to be beautiful. Some girls changed their answers to "to enjoy" seems like the event planners knew it was weird for their existence to be organic wallpapers. 
I'd rather the next event be a hackathon where Bitcoin is given as rewards to tackle certain challenges. They have until the cruise is over. All this education is mixed with ads that I feel an aantonopolous video offers more value than the cruise.

Can't we report anyone's addresses? Who's to decide the legit from the honest? Say someone fed up with bitmex puts their address on there. I'd say, if it was sent then the private key was used to sign and the transaction was honest.

Cash takes awhile to send globally. And it can get stolen by postal workers. Transferwise takes $12 to send $1000.... And check this out, [Converting your money can take a maximum of two working days, but it's very rare that it takes this long. And how quick your transfer arrives depends on how quickly your recipient’s bank can process your money. 
What time you pay for your transfer —  we can only handle your money during normal banking hours. And things may take a little longer if the country you’re sending to has a national holiday.](
My family abroad doesn't even have a bank account! They are entirely cash based but they can always find someone to sell Bitcoin to, at a premium mind you. Find a remittance where the recipient gets more money than you sent! You simply cannot. And it depends on if the banks are open or not?? Bitcoin doesn't sleep, it's 10 minute average global settlements non stop. No holidays shutdown for the Bitcoin network.
 
He sends 12,000 Bitcoin for a .000166 Bitcoin fee... At current prices that's $77 million sent globally for a $1 fee. Remittances is where Bitcoin shines.

And to add on to his personal experience, 1 mb blocks took me weeks to initially sync the blockchain. (I didn't leave my computer on constantly but turned it on and synced it when I could). I sympathize with people in the future who wants to sync terabyte blocks as I don't think they will ever catch up. Also I don't leave my node on at all times. Whenever I need to use it, I'll turn it on and let it sync. I would have to wait much longer downloading and verifying bigger blocks as I have to wait some time for even 1 mb blocks. Disk space isn't an issue, it's the time to sync/verify for me.

Hard part was Bitcoin being worth anything at all. From 0 to 8-14 cents(?). The more Fiat printed, which can't be stopped, the greater the Bitcoin:Fiat ratio will be.

And that there's no flaw with consensus in this social experiment.

There's a difficulty adjustment if people drop out it gets easier to find a block so people try again.

@_date: 2019-02-28 11:21:23
So I'm thinking, add a contact as in email address book. But in this context, sending to a paynym incurs double the fee because the devs have to pay the miners or is it for profit?

Bitcoin can be $0.00000001 and still be alive and useful. Blocks can also be 30 mins late sometimes. I would just make the flow chart simple and just have it say Bitcoin is alive because it is anti-fragile.

Distribution was done through Captcha... That doesn't exists on the block lattice. That was a site. And dpos has no mining so no work to make nano. Collin had to make it all right away. Like typing digits and poof, money out of thin air. Collin made it all then you had to trust him to send it to others who completed a captcha... 
I'm good. Nano isn't anything revolutionary like Bitcoin. No work( similar to how gold needs work to extract) was done to mint nano and I don't want to pay for something that can be made for free. Nano is so small I'd rather fork and did what Collin did than buy it with Bitcoin.

Nano is the same old create digital units for free/ out of thin air. It takes work to make Bitcoin. Colin created all the nank at the push of a button then you had to trust him to give it all away. He didn't because he left some for himself. With Bitcoin, satoshi said hey dig if you want.

I forgot but it was the only Bitcoin ATM near me. I thought it was normal for the convince. I don't buy full bitcoins so I thought it was okay. I'm sure when there's competition like the 4% atm, that the shit ones will to out of business.

I won't assume deflation is good. I'd rather hold a deflationary asset where issuance is determined by code than an inflationary one where issuance is determined by a group of secret people.

But there's no use case besides money. What use cases were viable that needs a block chain?

There is no purpose of altcoins honestly except take money from noobs.
If an altcoin over takes Bitcoin then something else can overtake it and there goes digital scarcity.

You can't give me a fake Bitcoin. My node won't accept it and I will wait for payment in Bitcoin before giving you your product.

@_date: 2018-12-10 21:06:53
No you're thinking about it wrong. It's like in Venezuela. They store value in the best. Would you trade your Fiat for bolivars? Hodlers won't trade their Bitcoin for any Fiat because Bitcoin is the best (Imo) store of value.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:51:50
More like if you mess with Bitcoin then you can't sustain economically.

Every node has a different mempool and different configurations before they drop a transaction. I set a fee too low once and it was about a week. Your mileage will vary.

So I told my mom that you don't need to trust anyone, as long as you have the skills to do so... What are the skills one should start at and how will I go about doing so? I want to learn as a hobby so I understand that it can take years but at least it's possible to learn right?
Is there a YouTube channel that breaks down line by line and also teaches noobs about this stuff?
Also thanks for posting/taking the time to write about this.

iOS is closed sourced. Doesn't matter if apps are Foss if the os can't be audited. If you want sovereignty over your os you can use rattlesnake os for a hardened Android experience. Even remove Google play dependencies and route all network traffic through tor, using orbot, if you are paranoid. 
If you want a smart phone and you are technologically impaired/elderly, get an iPhone. If you want a small computer, get an Android.
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:02:31
Nope. It's too heavy and people would start storing it in vaults and using Fiat lol. We could start using gold now but it's too burdensome. Also it must be a coordinated emp. One Bitcoin ledger in a Faraday's cage can still carry on the ledger history.

Ok. You adopt whatever money you want.

Well it's a real address. If it's not yours (check with another wallet) then malware changed your address while it was in your clipboard to the hackers address.

You can't guess a 12 word seed that actually leads to a spendable Bitcoin balance. Actually I kind of lied; I once tried the seed bacon x 24 and had access to 10k sats, but someone withdrew it before me.

That's not Bitcoin though. In the eyes of Bitcoin nodes they are lying peers trying to deceive you of your product.

Doesn't that just mean Fiat has gone to being worthless?

To break consensus rules (blocksize is one of them) you need everyone to upgrade. It's hard to upgrade in a centralized fashion (think delaying Windows updates). It might be near impossible the have everyone update in a decentralized one.

The best I've seen. What do you think is better?
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:49:19
Yup if it's open source and backwards compatible it can be incorporated into Bitcoin.

2 million a minute. Bitcoin is 1.25 per minute. The bitcoin:dollar will only grow at that rate
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:22:46
This will age like fine Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:57:58
Better than bcash. Bcash has crashed harder than Bitcoin. 
Better than Fiat since 1 Bitcoin is still &gt; 1 dollar. Doubly so, if the fed prints more than $12.5 every 10 minutes. 
Better than gold since gold is heavy and cumbersome to transact in.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:13:22
Yeah but they can never stop printing money. If the rate of printing is greater than Bitcoin, then the value of bitcoin:dollars will always be greater
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:22:10
What most people in rbtc fail to see is that you are only a peer if you run and use a full node. Take away your ability to run a full node is akin to taking you away from being a peer who must then rely on big institutions and their version of the ledger.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:04:50
It's hot potato money. Get rid of it and buy things now before more enter the system.
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:38:18
I heard they don't hold it directly but leave it on their local Bitcoin wallets to not have to pay (an extra) miner fee

1. It's better that mining is done on Asics. To attack the network you must buy special equipment that is worthless once you destroy the network. So there's more incentives to be honest. And no matter what large infrastructures will be built to mine Bitcoin. The rich can just as well buy CPU and gpus, but when the network is attacked they can use those cpus/gpus for other things.
@_date: 2019-05-02 10:56:47
If you never mined a block with a cpu are you even a miner? A kid who digs for gold but never finds gold is a gold miner?
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:52:33
Let's do it with Fiat in the bank as well! See which one is the real scam
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:11:15
On mobile it looks like shit
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:34:50
So sounds like Bitcoin since it is both a store of value and currency of exchange. And in an environment of two store of value coins, the better store of value coin wins. 
Anything can be a medium of exchange: litecoin, bcash, Fiat, etc. It's hard to become the best store of value.
@_date: 2018-12-22 17:26:21
But I thought the trezor itself is an offline computer. You sign and confirm on the device. Anyways do you think coldcard has fixed this as you can plug into a battery and use micro SD to transfer
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:20:32
They can ban it like they can ban torrenting. It's enforcing the ban that matters.
