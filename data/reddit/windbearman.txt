For each private key a public key and BTC address must be generated and it must be checked that there is a non-zero value of BTC linked to the BTC address. This is much more resource consuming than the above calculations assume. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 09:43:47
Great, thanks for your thoughts guys!
@_date: 2016-01-08 14:29:54
Meh... So I guess I was busting my head in vain, trying to find a visual matching pattern. You should have made it clear that this contest is only open for cryptography (one that has little to do with btc) fans
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:53:50
Coinbase and bitpay would disagree. I am afraid you are pushing early btc promoters out of business. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:11:44
In fairness I am happy with any scaling solution just to make this madness stop. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:57:54
Nonsense. I am following both /btc and /bitcoin and both are equally interesting to me. If I was to make the choice between the two, I prefer the uncensored platform. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:03:55
Contracts are in place to avoid ambiguity. They gave me us the payout day and for some this was one of the factors leading to go for a long position.
@_date: 2017-03-06 00:09:12
Well, have made some screenshots and have loaded hashes of these to blockchain so that I have some proof what happened ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:32:33
Do you think they can update it for contracts that have already been agreed?
I am asking because I too noticed their mistake and consequently bet on ETF approval :) 
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:55:22
Is it returning to the same address? Perhaps your desired return address is in the same wallet... You can post the incoming/outgoing transactions
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:41:01
"... increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions." 
Satoshi Nakamoto, The Whitepaper
I bet he would agree paying $1 transaction fee for a beer - a casual transaction - is limiting possibility for these transactions. 
Face it Luke, the transaction costs are way too high for casual transactions and are approaching credit card fees, which Satoshi himself considered way too high. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:07:39
OK, so practically what you are saying is useless as it is not really being done that way.
@_date: 2017-02-06 07:13:19
10 BTC = 10k USD left for the pension in NY is more about poor planning than gambling - if that is all you have. If it goes up 50x you're still not sorted.
@_date: 2017-03-06 06:58:36
I am afraid this is a change of the rules while the game is still on rather than a simple inconvenience. The least that can be done is to allow those who considered the actual content of the contract to withdraw their long position.
@_date: 2017-03-06 00:12:07
Ouch :) I believed the contracts were sacred
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:36:24
Not my favourite. So flashy. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:54:36
would you please elaborate on this one?
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:04:21
Many could have dumped if they wanted already...
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:07:14
From environmental point of view it would be great if people were not buying junk they do not really need. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:19:27
BS proposals like this one only fuel support for r/btc side. Well done, Luke "attention-seeker"  Jr.
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:41:51
You were quite lucky you did not have your funds at exchange to dump straight away at 0.08 ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:29:15
Would love another legitimate business like Coinbase, it attract corporate investment and does a great deal for appreciation of btc price. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 09:54:48
I had a legitimate question so do not understand the need for a vulgar / wannabefunny reaction.
I agree with the answer; the question is whether this is indeed enough to justify the investment. The knowledge could be as well gained from open sources and code so the only benefit would be brand awareness. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 19:09:55
I am over 30 and yesterday was the first time I was accused of trolling. Thanks for making it personal. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 09:10:23
The fact that my view on this particular issue coincides with the way RBTC see it does not mean anything. I am still pro-segwit and want it to go ahead. But it can not be seen as a trade off because it is something what is primarily wanted by one side of this dispute. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 11:31:41
Nothing about segwit is a compromise. This is 100% core proposal so please do not try to sell it as a trade off. 
We all know what segwit does, no need to repeat it. It is not mutually exclusive with with an increase to 2Mb so we can combine it and process 3-4x transactions this will make most people in BTC ecosystem happy. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 08:55:11
Quite a few people including Erik Voorhees suggested Segwit+2Mb block: This would satisfy both miners, most of BU and most of Core community and solve the problem for a long time. 
Seriously guys, don't you think this type of trade off would not be beneficial for bitcoin, its price and adoption? 
Do not compare it with some castles in the sky you have in mind, compare it with something we have right now. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 21:16:52
Thanks for your view. Indeed, if the question was which one to choose I would also pick segwit. However, in the interest of finally reaching some agreement I also would not mind segwit + 2Mb. I used to run a node and I did not stop due to technical requirements. The impact on CPU/network/HDD of full nodes would not be significant with up to 2 Mb blocks. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 19:20:49
I would never think so, but I agree there are extreme views on both Core and BU sides (Core wants small blocks &amp; BU wants centralisation 
 nonsense etc.)
@_date: 2017-04-29 09:03:50
So what does AXA get back in exchange for its investment?
@_date: 2017-04-14 12:01:47
Probably users using old wallets. 
Re: "spam": There are simply more people interested in sending a transaction than there is a space in the block. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 11:55:40
Not everything that is simple is automatically flawed. The Trump argument is silly, just waiting for someone bringing up Hitler...
@_date: 2017-04-14 19:03:26
It feels quite sad to be labeled as troll.. I am a long-time bitcoin supporter and hate to see the fight in the community we have nowadays. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 11:45:42
This has been repeated so many times everyone is aware of it it. I seriously do not know why does anyone feel they have to retype the statement for the 1000+1 time. 
Just accept the reality that many people simply prefer 2Mb + segwit so that we get a sensible compromise across the majority of the community and get another 2 years to come up with LN or some other scaling solution. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 19:05:04
Not sure what gave you that idea but I have read a lot about segwit and I am supporter of pruning the signatures off the blocks. Why are you spending time accusing people, is there nothing better to do? 
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:27:52
Not everything Roger says is plain stupid but this tweet certainly is. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:03:26
Funny linking so many great individuals with the likes of Craig Wright. Seems to my pretty childish and reminds me of Sheldon Cooper's constantly changing list of mortal enemies.
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:35:02
There will be a HF sooner or later anyway. Many new features are waiting for it not just block increase. 
On the other hand, there would be no one who would profit from 21m hard cap.. with a possible exception of those betting huge amount on price decrease. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:16:09
Clickbait. Not new at all and even waiting for 1 transaction solves the issue. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:55:15
idiot for investing into bitcoin rather than one of the 800 altcoins? Of course coin XXX is much more likely to appreciate significantly; it is also much more likely to lose value. Also, you would need significant trading volumes in the future not to ruin the market when selling (not guaranteed with alts).
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:37:13
congrats for selling it to yourself as there is no one stupid enough to buy some Lordkek
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:34:27
for me the happiness is $10,000/BTC and Segwit+2Mb
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:48:52
Show us the transaction ;-)
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:53:13
Any headline that groups together Craig Wright and Erik Voorhees is a clickbait. 
Segwit+2mb please, the sooner, the better.
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:30:39
Sure, agreed. Let's have one with segwit + 2mb; this is a good trade off for reasonable bigger blockers and let's not talk about Unlimited again.
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:15:27
Sorry, I forgot the most important word:
I meant to say there would be no one who would profit from BREAKING 21m hard cap. My bad.
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:48:59
Stupid games. A bit embarrassing from Roger. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 09:37:55
Agreed. Of course people will have different ideals about ideal solution but Segwit + 2mb in 6 moths is much better than the current situation. 
Satoshi himself said that the temporary antispam limit of 1mb should be taken away once blocks start getting filled. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:57:44
I also think the more the better but vast majority of user should not run it as it does not benefits them directly. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:51:51
Point taken, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:49:47
I understand some boys like to play soldiers but can we please just move on? 2.5 years on this topic has been enough.
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:16:16
Your forgot to add "i think" before your sentence. Do not present your opinions as facts. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:24:31
That does not mean much. I signed up as well (using my alternate nickname) even though I certainly do not support UASF.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:03:56
I am visiting both bitcoin and btc. About the same number of worthy contributors and nutcases across both communities. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 07:40:51
Most of discussion going on on r/btc have about the same quality/lame ratio as r/bitcoin. 
Dr. CW is a laughing stock for most on both sides anyway but his favourable opinion of big blocks does not disqualify them. Same as Hitler's favourable opinion of national parks and dogs did not discredit these. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:13:46
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:24:40
Yep, that makes sense. Good to have majority of both camps agreeing on that one. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:23:15
Let's not kick around and be happy he decided the way he decided.
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:27:09
It makes one wander what differentiates a wild guessing game from the prediction.
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:25:49
I care about many TPS, that is why segwit2x ;-)
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:37:50
no, thank you. Do not intend to sell my 100+ btc anytime soon. I will stick to bigger blocks with segwit. I certainly did not see how 95% nodes are killed by top 5 alts even though they create blocks much faster than btc.
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:28:23
Go ahead but I do not think you will beat most exchangers. I am with exchangers, payment processors and most wallet providers on this one. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:06:25
Miners loudly supported segwit + 2MB (effectively 4MB blocks). They did not support segwit alone. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:02:16
you should not store your btcs on the exchanges anyway so I do not see how a withdrawal day could affect anything.
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:45:51
No. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:13:24
It is sad that both nonsense extremist comments from both sides of the stalemate are getting so much attention. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 12:59:41
If the miners and many exchangers approve segwit2x, which they will, what is the point of UASF? I am happy with the compromise. Segwit now, 2mb later. 
Kudos to UASF though, it was the rallying cry needed to speed things up. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:15:06
If someone does not understand the difference between "forked" and "may possibly fork in the future" they should not write... at all. 
The article is an incoherent overly ambitious mess trying to cover too many topics - that has to absolutely confuse the readers. Garbage.
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:11:33
Before you pay try checking 
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:28:01
Yep. Lets do it, increase the capacity and finally focus on other projects. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 06:35:12
What a load of horseshit. 
What exactly is the link between china testing the first crypto and getting one of the 800 alts? 
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:00:27
by your logic it is chinacoin already so feel free to sell them all ;-) 
I want segwit to happen but UASF is not the way to do it. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:38:59
We would talk about speed if the transaction time took seconds. When talking about 8 hours we are talking about unreasonable delay. 
By the way the wallet suggested I pay more than 2$ for the transaction so the fee did not look suspiciously low to me. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:59:52
That is stupid. I will not abandon my exchange I am happy with as a customer.
