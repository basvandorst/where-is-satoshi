Hahah idk why you think that I think they hoard cash in a big ole' vault somewhere. Its stored in computers and there is never any physical cash creating or doing anything.

You realize that these "idiots chasing freebies" and the welfare state in the US is a direct result of capitalism? Capitalism is so efficient that when left to its own devices will create unemployment and poverty because people are not needed to do the jobs they used to do. These people have become irrelevant to the economy. Those jobs are gone and if too many people are broke and aren't spending money that economy collapses. Government and the welfare state step in to stop that from happening. You can't have your quality of life and not care about what the masses are doing. 
I'm so sick of seeing this ignorant uneducated ideology thrown around. Grow up and go learn something.

Woah woah. I'm not saying everything should be free. I'm saying that the free market takes care of things and one thing it never took care of was insuring peoples deposits. When shit hit the fan in the great depression it had to be addressed and the government dealt with it. If it made economic sense to provide this insurance then I don't see why they didn't. Of you think people would be willing to pay for depositors insurance so charge for it and the market fixes itself. This hasn't been the case and if you think there is a better solution I urge you to change the system. I don't think everything needs to be free but I know that everything got the way it is now for a reason. Change happens and maybe we will move further away from government intervention in the future, but the trend for the last century has been the merging of government and the economy more and more.
I'm sure everyone saying they don't like the government would have a hard time giving up their mortgage deductions. Even though if everyone gave up mortgage deductions, the US debt could be made up over night.

These things are a function of capitalism. Technological advances are a product of it in action. Regardless, if you educate people on personal finance, a culture of saving and individual responsibility then we may have a shot at achieving the goal of making a government or central authority irrelevant. Unfortunately, that educating is done mostly through public education and that doesn't seem like it will change anytime soon. Do you also not believe in public schooling because it is a part of the welfare state?

Protectionism is about a government implementing trade restrictions to protect the price of its domestic goods from cheap imports. Sure this is a way of protecting workers from the international market which will put them out of work but I do not argue for this. I do not see a problem with globalization and with unskilled jobs going over sees. I'll take my affordable Chinese goods and be happy that capitalism is efficient enough to being me these goods. I won't even think about child labor or poor working conditions when buying them. 
All I am saying is that the welfare state; food stamps, welfare, section 8, unemployment, Medicare, all of it, is a result of deficiencies in the market. The economy needs these people spending money and buying things. Just look at any of the articles that show how much the investment banks are making off of SNAP and EBT cards. And that's is just in fees. Then you have all that money being spent in the economy (a good thing) which probably helps some businesses just stay in business. A grocery store like Price Rite is probably in business literally just because of food stamps. Its such a big market that almost every convenience store takes them now too.
I rather like the quality of life I live and if these domestic policies need to be in place to make that happen than okay.

I didn't say that. I said it hasnt happened yet in regards to depositors insurance. You sound like a pro free market, fuck government regulation type. Why hasn't the free market fixed this problem yet? Why did the government have to step in and create an agency to solve this problem. I think the market likes letting the government deal with something like depositors insurance. After all, why the fuck should the banks care about their customers at all. Well the government cares about the customers because if all our money disappears and we are broke then it threatens the states sovereignty and that is something every single state is trying to avoid.
There is no voluntary depositors insurance market. Go create one. You may be hard pressed since everyone gets it for free though. I urge you to then run for office and change this legislation if you really find it so terrible and intrusive.

You need to educate the masses bro. They really don't teach you what these ideologies are unless you take more in depth government and political courses or unless you are interested enough to educate yourself. It doesn't surprise me most people mix up liberals, classic liberals, socialists, realists, libertarians, idealists, and all the neo variations. Especially if they get their interpretations of these from the TV. I don't see why your average joe would care about the academic definitions of those thoughts and beliefs either, unless of course they would like to intelligently debate theories. Which they shouldnt do if they don't have an understanding of such topics.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:08:05
I'm not arguing for protectionism. I question whether you are able to follow this debate. I'm telling you how it has played out over history. Any economist worth his salt recognizes the inefficiencies of using economic analysis in relation to everything. You're fighting with me about how there could be voluntary depositors insurance; you bring up economics, yet you fail to look at that situation under an economics perspective. If you had then you would realise economics says that the insurance would exist if it was profitable and economical to provide it. Since it doesn't exist, economics would tell us this is because the free market doesn't find it necessary.
Where are you going to put all the auto factory workers who don't have jobs because their unskilled labor has been taken over by machines or shipped abroad?

It is better than hoarding. There is no arguing that. But taking a hard look at the economy often doesn't translate into all these new jobs, and invested money doesn't increase money velocity because they aren't buying goods or services. They are able to get all their money back so long so long as the stock price does okay. Stocks are largely bought with already earned money and putting it into accounts in your name that increases in value and only you realize that gain isn't really helping the economy per say. Nothing new or useful is being generated besides the changing numbers in their accounts. I know that increased profits/valuation of a company is supposed to spur spending and growth in the economy but that hasn't been the case in recent years. Here's an article that talks about that profit/investment parallel if you're interested.

The credit card company pays them. There are not enough people using a 5% cash back on gas to cause the gas price to be higher for everyone else. That is just not the case. These rewards will run at 1% a year average for most cards and cards like discover will run a 5% cash back in certain categories for a two month span that revolves.

You can dispute discrepancies on your credit card statement and the companies are very good at taking care of it whereas your bank will say too bad. The rewards are real. You do have to spend money to get them and of course some people will spend more than they normally would have but if its something like gas and you get 5% back then it is quite worth it, especially if you're paying it off every month. Just a few of the reasons I would say credit cards aren't all evil if you know what you're doing.

I'm in it for the long haul whatever that may be. It seems to have passed 1000 now without much trouble. With the recent publicity it has been getting this could be new money coming into it now because they hope for huge gains. If thats the case we may rise higher. If it starts to fall hard I wouldn't mind selling and buying back at a lower price but right now I'm not watching it every minute so that trade would be hard to make. It'd be nice to lock in gains here especially is it falls to 900 or lower again. Hard to say. I just don't want to miss judge and lose any of the coin I already have so I have been trying to stay away from say trading it.

I don't think enough people use this cash back that it causes gas to be higher for everyone. Id love to see some proof of that. The 5% cash back is the high rate that revolves between other categories every other month and Id bet a large amount of people with these cards do not even take the 10 seconds every month to activate the rewards. Most cards only operate at 1% if that is their main reward. I doubt gas is 3 cents higher because of these reward programs implemented on some credit cards. Gas fluctuates that much almost daily.

First of all, don't initiate a transfer if your not going to have the appropriate funds. Secondly, unless this was an account used only for making purchases with coinbase, why are you always without any backup funds. Thirdly, please get your finances in check because you cannot outwit a bank transfer by hoping that a second transfer you made posts to the account before the first one. This is silly and your description confused me. I still gave you upvotes to get recognition because hopefully at least coinbase will understand your dilemma.

I'm just hoping other countries who are less vested in controlling their population than China will not interfere with it.

Anyone who put more money into this than they could afford to lose is an idiot.

It may not be

Would you say its relatively secure as well?
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:25:06
Which could mean a world of difference for how this plays out. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:24:28
And those look awesome. I like em a lot.

Everyone hear complains about how BTC is too expensive for them and they missed out.Then you got litecoin that went from $4 last week to almost $40 now. I dont follow it but it seems like I should. Its going up right along with BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:02:56
Hahah, No. The beginning happens far before any of the milestones you listed. That's where you make the real money.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:48:12
Read the article maybe
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:48:02
FYI every down vote you get is not a shill.

Ive had good success with coinbase in the past.

All of my friends are aware that I'm an asshole so its not all that bad.

The owner didnt actually get bitcoin. Some guy traded it to another person who called in a credit card order.

I saw this BIP38 encrypt on the paper wallet on bitaddress.org but was not sure what it was. I will have to look into some more and read the link you provided. Thanks for this.

Youre stupid. You need not say anymore.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:18:36
Three times today I have sat down at my computer after doing other things and watched the price drop over a hundred bucks. It sucks and I'm trying to stop myself from watching so I do not start day trading it.

Dont be sorry. I do my redditing on mobile and can't see any sidebar nonsense. Regardless they are the two most popular crytocurrencies and should be talked about alongside each other. That sidebar ban is just nonsense.

Im quite sure no one does this for a living
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:47:45
Proving it makes sure your the one who gets the payout.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:43:04
Its just you who isn't responding to the plethora of refutations to your points.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:09:36
Why do you say this? The article clearly goes over the way one would collect the payout granted they helped the person perish and showed that by guessing the timing correctly beforehand.

Bernanke is not a good main target. This man is misguided.
