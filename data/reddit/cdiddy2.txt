im pretty sure that debit fees are a lot cheaper than credit ones, even on the same card. you also dont get rewards for using debit like you would have with credit

I can't really help you on the reliability questions, someone else may be able to.
1. Its a great use case for LN!
2. I would recommend looking into a BTCPay server and getting that setup. They have lots of documentation. 
3. I would guess the success rate is decently high for anything under $10, but there isn't much way to know for sure.
Last thing, remember that this is software in the works, it may not work 100% at this time, so just be aware of that.

sure, but the gap between price and hashrate means nothing. since they arent on the same scale you could put the hashrate anywhere on there and change the gap. also the hashrate can increase from efficiency in ASIC gains which doesnt necessarily mean the overall miner money spent is going up even if the hashrate increases

Love it. Same idea as mine

Patent has since expired.
"It was covered by U.S. Patent 4,995,082 which expired in February 2008."

I believe you can't receive LN payments at all. I'd double check that though
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:33:54
To be clear, if you want to receive LN payments you DO need a node at this time. Until watchtowers come out that will be the case. You can still receive bitcoin network payments to load BTC onto the wallet, but you wont be able to receive any LN based payments

fees should be under a dollar for everyone 
cheaper if you use segwit
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:41:30
thats where you are just flat out wrong

I understand the healing can only happen after, I think we should have let things fall after 2008 and we wouldnt have gotten ourselves back into the same mess. But I dont cheer for pain and suffering even if it is necessary

I'm all for Bitcoin gaining adoption and things like that. But saying you can't wait for the dumpening is pretty gross, it won't be fun, it won't be happy, it will painful for the entire world and the people that will hurt the most aren't the people that caused it to be like this. So don't be happy for the dumpening, it's disgusting and ignorant to want that to happen without serious consideration for the consequences

analysts are idiots. no listens to them in traditional markets, no one should listen to them here

if we could have the ease of use of blue wallet in a non custodial app, that is when lightning is ready

you can tell the market is getting good when the quality of the memes goes up. good meme
@_date: 2019-05-06 09:10:07
Ya but then the ease of use is gone
