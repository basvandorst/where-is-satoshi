Put better than I had; still seeking the answer.

Your argument is based on adoption alone? Yep, Bitcoin has it licked there, but on everything else, Nano might be better!

Don't shoot me, general observations, new investors would rather have xxxx of a coin than less than 1, it is a mindset. Bitcoin is mined which is inefficient; if the mainstream world started using it, controls would need to be put in place, which leads me on to China's 'control' over mining blocks, a cause for concern. First mover advantage maybe, but if you want privacy you pick XMR, if you want an every day currency, you use NANO etc. Fwiw, BTC is my 2nd largest holding, the above just highlights potential issues newbies have to overcome!

Worth researching then, it has almost instant transfers, feeless, not controlled by the Chinese, eco friendly. Bitcoin isn't more suited day to day, only as a store of value holding on to first mover advantage!

Tether imploding, USDT is being converted to BTC. I did this last night when I spotted it dipping (albeit in to ETH for speed of transfer to exchange to FIAT). So I've lost 25% potential gains this morning, but saved 10% in tether losses...every cloud....

He hasn't promised riches (of sort) but has designed a system of zero value in exchange for ETH of value. Anyone putting money into this is a fool. It doesn't matter if you receive 25,000 HEX or 1,000,000 HEX, the value will be so low that you'll never recover what you spent; hell, those that just claimed via the BTC snapshot might never recover the pennies of ETH spent to sign the request! Ask yourself what use the token has!

Probably Richard Heart converting all that ETH /s

Wouldn't be a hodler if he/she had a lambo no?

Stay off the net, problem solved ;) /s

That is coinbase

Great but a waste of time when you've paid way too much on fees. Why didn't you just use Coinbase Pro instead if that is your platform of choice?
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:48:45
I'm afraid you are wrong, not the waiter. The OP made a request to Coinbase to transfer the BTC, it can take a while to actually get sent as Coinbase do them in batches. Sending from an exchange will work just the same as from a wallet, but usually with a delay. The restaurant now have both the BTC and the fiat, win win for them!

Interested to know what your average price is as I assume you've been buying at the bottom and top?
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:56:09
I get Monero, but why do you still hold LTC when BTC now offers similar speeds and transaction costs? Just bags or a belief in the future of Litcoin (or Charlie!). Genuine question, no hidden agenda.

If he had bought BTC, you can be sure that the value would be significantly more than what it is today!

Unless you have access to free electricity and free computing power, then your 25 cents has probably cost you double that and will continue to do so. It is a nice thrill to think of 'earning' currency through mining, but in reality, you are paying for it!
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:07:04
BTC, EOS, XLM, ADA, ETH in that order imo
@_date: 2018-12-31 22:30:31
You bought 0.01BTC with $400?

And if Tether ceases to be? You'll lose the lot! If you are adamant about keeping the fiat away from your bank for risk of spending, use a fiat gateway exchange and hold there, like Coinbase. Not that either option is ideal.
