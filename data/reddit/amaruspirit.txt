Are you using Bitgo? If not, why not?
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:16:30
hours before the hack is just as likely to be bitfinex employes... funds were drained ~10 hours before announcement.
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:06:31
those are two different services.

it helps them. That way the battle shifts from everyone vs bitfinex to affected vs unaffected account
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:03:30
because they turn this into 'bitcoin holders' vs 'usd/alts holders' and let us battle it out to take some heat off them. 
Also, it's the only move that prevents them from declaring bankruptcy.

not the a hacker, just a self promoting douchbag

thanks this is good info
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:37:21
this is really interesting

I had a bitgo wallet. All you can see is the address, can't move or freeze the funds.
I deposited some funds about a month ago and since I bought some ltc, etc and had margin positions. Funds on the blockchain remain untouched.

they're not socializing losses unless we force them to.

We did not have segregated wallets. Do you know what's a bitcoin wallet? It's a private key. We did not have any private key.
You had segregated bitcoin wallets for your customers funds.

what's the problem?
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:09:24
apparently they lost the insurance a few months ago
can still be sued for misleading advertising. probably why they removed the post.

the easiest way to rob a bank is to own one

would you say it's a fair assessment to say that coinbase is betting the future of the company more on ethereum than on bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:35:06
this is still bitgo's fault. If they put their name behind Bitfinex's security and don't hold them up to any reasonable standard they are just as liable.

What happens if somebody hacked your account, used the use to be Btc and then withdraw?
Having any sort of capital on the exchange is a risk.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:27:02
the whole idea of using a 3rd party service like Bitgo is that even incase the system is 100% in control of the hacker they can't change those settings.
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:58:04
I'm in.
