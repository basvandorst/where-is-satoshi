I hate how people put these plates on nice cars. It's like they want to be recognized for investing early. I bet I knew about Bitcoin before he did, he was just lucky to have money to buy it and keep himself preoccupied while it was going up. I'm not impressed.

No, I don't agree at all.

The same can be said about any cryptocurrency. Bitcoin isn't exceptional.

who cares
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:02:41
This is why we need further evolution in crypto. Can't be this easy for someone to steal.

Fake news

I hope this makes it to the top of the front page of Reddit.

@_date: 2018-03-09 23:03:34
Perfect. That's what we need.
