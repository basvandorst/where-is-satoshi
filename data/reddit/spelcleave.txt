*whose* cocks though. We need to be accurate.

I get the message. But $2800 would very much help me right no so maybe they needed it bad.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:14:05
$77! :D (may not have been January)
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:34:55
That's fair. NYK NYC makes enough sense on its own. Hadn't thought of it that way. 
I've been told on this thread crypto.com is a better choice?
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:34:49
They get off with no charges? Sweet.

I have only ever used cash app to pay one specific friend. Had no idea I could buy BTC with it. 
Probably will now that I'm aware. Only like $50 worth though lol

Explain it then. In full. And explain precisely why he is in the wrong in an objective manner.
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:53:13
Even I, an ignorant pawn devoid of all understanding of BTC, knows Eth is trash. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:39:58
Yes? 
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:13:51
I don't know what MtGox is or what happened to it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:40:21
Alright legit question: I bought $25 worth in January through CashApp. That service is legit, right?
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:39:36
My adorable little .006 has grown from $25 to $77. I am so proud.
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:28:53
True. I do wonder how Bitcoin breaks down when buying anything. 
If I had 1 Bitcoin (let's just say I invested and bought one for $3k) and I wanted to buy a pair of shoes that are worth $50, I'm assuming that translates to spending 
.01468882 Bitcoin for the shoes.

Or if you talk about not being able to afford $1200 extra dollars on top of a move in.
Then apparently you aren't fun or don't want to decorate. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 21:44:21
I would so very much love to have Bitcoin. Alas it is $3k for one �� 
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:15:15
That's why I invested $25 in BTC. Sure it's small but *insert "I'm doing my part" meme*
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:16:49
Didn't sell the useless fake currency? K.
@_date: 2018-11-19 05:58:14
So if I'm willing to to buy 300 Bitcoin for $3. That's all they're worth?
Hmmmmm 
I smell a scam to be had *cackles*
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:03:11
I mean it's not even a real currency, so who cares? 
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:35:12
Yea I shouldn't lol
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:05:34
Oh boy! That'll make my .00607th of one Bitcoin be worth a LOT more than $25. ($48.50 now. It DOUBLED :D)
If 1 BTC could just hit 10 mil that'd be cool.

Ah Christ, I was 13 when I was in the car with my mother and asked why doesn't the government just print money to use. 
She explained exactly the issues with that and I understood it right away. 
I hate this moron.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:38:03
I should've bought when it was $3500 and sold half now that it's at 8k ��
