Can the mod remove this or place misleading title, or just make fun of OP?

There were miners trading at $1. That's how it got to $2.
@_date: 2014-12-23 14:49:46

You want Coinbase to stay in business or go out of business? 
@_date: 2014-12-26 01:40:25
You just claimed to donate and we're not sure you did.
@_date: 2014-12-09 02:15:52
Punctuation could be your friend here.

trademark right appropriation of name of open source code of which the foundation is namesake is not part of core development?
i don't think it will be granted , even without opposition, but not all core development has to do with code. Bitcoin lives in the human world too with human made laws and constraints.
@_date: 2014-12-10 17:13:17
right. of course. obviously nothing to say of the fact that the company chose the namesake to be showered with all the credits when newbies read about the wonderful world and the marvel that is the blockchain.
this sub is pretty strange.
@_date: 2014-12-23 18:45:37
Dave, do you want to take another stab at what you said there ?

@_date: 2015-01-13 15:42:14
Your buddy, right.
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:33:12
Vous discutez dans votre article que les acteurs comme les banquiers sont avantagées en achetant des parties d'entreprises Bitcoin ou bitcoin pour pouvoir ensuite continuer d'avoir une influence. Je suppose c'est pourquoi vous faites comparaison a votre réponse plus haut a cette phrase "Even someone who stands to lose from Bitcoin by not reacting to it, such as a banker or government agent, stands to gain a great deal by buying now." Vous donnez accord alors au commentateur primaire lorsqu'il demande "Defection?"
Donc alors, ma question est la suivante. Est-ce que nous connaissons des parties ou entreprises qui sont prêtes a investir des sommes que nous voyons chez Coinbase, mais qui ont été refusées? Vous serez d'accord que Coinbase en a vachement besoin, des sous. 
Ou peut-etre ne serait-ce qu'une situation ou il y'a des gens qui parlent pour parler et d'autres qui parlent avec l'argent? Et nous demeurons frustrés parce que nous sommes des gens sans sous qui ne parlons que pour parler.
edit: save you a step on that pyramid before you mock the punctuation or grammar, i'm using an english keyboard.
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:46:12
You stepped up and gave them money they desperately needed ? And they turned you down ?
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:44:55
Have we seen or known of non institutional investors (non corporate magnates) provide funding to Coinbase which it desperately needs.

Nooooo, please don't say that.

He didn't respond back to you ?
@_date: 2015-01-10 14:59:27
it's actually kinda terrible.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:02:54
lets see here.... if you didn't get downvoted then i wouldn't not disagree with you right now until if you did get downvoted then i would agree with not. if you get upvoted my brain explodes.
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:37:01
What's the total cost ?
@_date: 2015-01-10 14:50:54
You speak for me too do you ? Ok ok you're right. But don't speak for me though in the future, just say the entire community except for 28z.
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:37:18
Oh I agree with your sentiment. Indian programmers are cheap knockoffs and really can't compare to the grandeur and majesty that is the American programmer. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:00:00
Bitcoin doesn't. But companies like Coinbase do.
@_date: 2015-01-20 20:50:21

Francis you're one of the good guys that the Foundation needs but because you're not vile, provocative or extreme enough, your chances are slim. I will be voting for you. Good luck. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:30:11
What's wrong with Indian programmers ?
@_date: 2015-01-10 14:51:54
I disagree with you, but really only because you're getting downvoted.

That's an unhealthy diet. He should take better care of his nutritional intake. I suggest protein and vegetables , with as little as complex carbohydrates as possible.

I could show you links on legitimate pharmacy listings that are on legitimate sources but I'm lazy. So I'll go with saying Visa and MC wouldn't cancel from legitimate pharmacies. Easy.
