That's the top amount mined under a single address, correct? It's likely that big miners don't want to draw attention to themselves by doing it all under one address. Also likely they are not using pools. I suspect there are much larger single set ups out there. Look at what vladimir (I think is his handle) has been posting on the bitcoin forums. People have built much more powerful clusters than this "supercomputer" just in the last few weeks specifically for bitcoin mining.

I can understand putting a pause on trading until most people have regained access to their account, that's only fair. And the queuing makes sense, it will give the order book time to stabilize on a real price point.
The big thing right now is withdrawals. That's all anyone is going to be interested in doing, anyway. They really should have said something about that.

This is a single order book, not the fucking forex. Sorry, you are the retarded one here. Posting info from the SEC and thinking it is accurate for an exchange built for trading playing cards just proves that.
Edit: You are hilarious, bro. I sincerely hope you aren't trading on forex with any significant amount of money because any savvy trader would take about 8 seconds to realize that mtgox doesn't work like the forex. You are either an exellent troll or an excellent example of the dunning kruger effect, since every single one of your posts are getting downvoted to hell and you still think you are right and everybody else here is wrong.

When you first install the bitcoin client, it has to query the network and basically download the entire history of transactions since bitcoin's birth. Once it gets up to date it will see yours and claim your coins. Current block count is &gt;133k. You can see where your client is currently at in the status bar.

He can't help you learn because, as you said, he doesn't know what he's talking about. He obviously bought some forex trading system off an infomercial and maybe read a few wikipedia articles about it, and is assuming mtgox works like forex because its a "currency exchange". Mtgox uses a single bid/ask order book, exactly like he thinks it doesn't. He probably discovered bitcoin 2 hours ago on cnbc.

There's a big difference between brute forcing by an algorithm and guessing by a human. "Book" backwards isn't any easier to brute force, and it's still pretty damn hard to guess. And don't say "well an algorithm could try dictionary words backwards" or something like that. We're talking about John the Ripper here, not IBM's Watson.

That depends on if the people currently speculating in bitcoins by mining are willing to switch to speculating by outright purchasing them.This also applies (even more importantly) to newbie would-have-been miners who got to the party too late to mine but still want to cash in.
My gut says this will happen short to medium term. After that it depends on whether the currency starts seeing serious legitimate and/or black market trade use. (And I only put legitimate in there to appease the nerds. Bitcoin's long term future rests on black market adoption, I think.)

I suspect this too. Somebody did the math lower in this thread and figured his "supercomputer" is equivalent to roughly 50 GPUs. *Yawn*
But yeah, even without doing the math (which, really, I haven't), more importantly: If this is a top 300 supercomputer then it's somebody's full-time job (not OP) to know at all times what is running on it, why, and who is paying for it.

From the little background I've read on the design philosophy, a lot of thinking went into making the system not only robust from a techno standpoint but from an economic one, ie: making it more profitable under most imaginable scenarios for the parties involved to "play along". If you look on [the wiki]( at what a single party could do if they were to amass &gt;50% of network capacity, few if any of the options are appealing to that party if they could otherwise be profiting from fair use of the system. The attack points are really only attractive to somebody trying to fuck the game up for everyone.

Ok, I currently use a random 8-char alphanumeric string for every account that I came up with 10 years ago when that was basically impossible to crack. I decided I should change my ways, since it's now the phuture and all, so I came up with a scheme where I padded the string with some exclamation points and added a domain-specific salt as per this article. I had about 20 important accounts I wanted to protect, so I started going through the list...
* I get about 3 sites down my list, and my bank says I can't use punctuation. Fuck. Had to go back and change the padding to something else.
* Got about 5 sites in and my credit card company won't let me have two exact characters repeating. Fuck. Have to change the padding again.
* Got about 9 sites in and my insurance company has a SEVEN CHARACTER MAXIMUM.
Fuck this. Seriously. Just take my shit. I don't care anymore.

Uh, yeah, there are laws on paper, sure. But there's also this thing called precedence and case law. Sure you can pay a ton of money to hot shot lawyers to have them tell you how they THINK the courts would interpret those laws, but that's all you can do. I mean you obviously know that, and I agree good lawyers could reduce the uncertainty by some amount, but come on man, you cannot deny there would be a pretty big guinea pig factor for anybody who tries to be the first one to do this.
