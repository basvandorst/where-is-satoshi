Great idea, dude! Count me in!

It's similar, no doubt. But it still depends on the person you're sending money to being a traditional merchant. An average person isn't going to have a website to send the money to. They will have an email, though, or at least understand the concept of sending things to and from email addresses.
As for 72, yeah. That's not bad. I dig the idea. Thanks for pointing it out.

This is a really interesting idea. That does bring up another, "would people do it" question, though. Would you install my custom bind version on a server you run?
This really is an interesting idea, though... I will have to give this some real thought. Thanks!

That phrases it really well. Thank you!

Well, simple for the end-user. It would just be an email address as far as they are concerned. The person running the service would need some know-how, of course.

I didn't know about MtGox's shortening service. I'll have to check that out.
As for namecoin domains, I thought about that, and it's not a bad idea. I just keep coming back to that answers the question, "How do I make this simpler?" is "with this other complicated thing." On a related thought, though, maybe there's a service idea for namecoin domain purchasing made easier for average joes.
Thanks for the info!

I think there's an interesting idea here, though. I had a thought for a p2p dns service years ago that never went anywhere, and namecoin is trying something similar. There are secure ways of groups of people agreeing on where a message should go... Hrm..
I'm really going to have to give this line of though some more consideration. Part of my dilemma is that if I do put something together, I would love it to be something that other people can use and improve on, not just some convenience thing for just my users.

It's an interesting concept, but I don't think quite what I was thinking. This is more to do with the communication between merchant and customer; I'm more concerned with simplicity of addressing. So instead of sending btc to "1KrVNJTdU4x1r3Pg38QGs9QWuHW6QCcFKw", I could just send it to "myfriend
EDIT: Or at least, I don't see how that suggestion specifically addresses this. I could be missing something, though.
