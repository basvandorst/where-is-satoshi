Good luck :/
I have been trying to change my country in Coinbase since the beginning of November.

No, but they can be slow, and like every exchange they are known for making mistakes. Sorry I cant be more help. Good luck.

No problem! I have seen 5+ posts in the last couple days talking about, or speculating about, what coins will take off next year. I suggest tracking down some of those posts, reading them, researching what you think sounds interesting, and then making your own decision. Good luck!

Are you getting any kind of error message? Are you sure your account is verified? I don't think I am knowledgeable enough to be able to help you, but I think of you want someone else to try to help they'd need a bit more info. Good luck, I hope you are successful!

Only the 10th time I have seen this posted this morning.

Follow up question, what are tonight's winning lottery numbers?

You can buy $100 worth sure, but what is your goal? If it is to make money, then you need BTC to reach around 30k to make $100.
If I were you  and my goal was making money, I would find a cheaper coin that shows promise and buy a ton of it as opposed to a tiny tiny fraction of BTC.
If you want to buy BTC for another reason, then perhaps it is a good idea.

If you can afford it, I think it is a good long term decision.

BTC goes a lot slower. LTC and ETH are much faster.

I would say it is very unlikely to be lost. It could take hours to arrive though. I recommend sending ETH or LTC to Binance  much faster and the fees, compared to BTC, basically don't exist.

It is awful. I have been trying to follow their instructions to change my country for about two weeks now. They started to help me (after a week) and now they are just ignoring me. I have all the documents, I have followed their every request, and still, my country remains the same.
