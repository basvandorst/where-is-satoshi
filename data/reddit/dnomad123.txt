the only reason why it is so volatile is because it's new. price discovery is going on right now and it's trying to find its place in the world. once we become more mainstream, the value should remain more stable. that could be 3-5 years down the line depending how fast we hit critical mass.

I stopped visiting bitcoin subreddits during this time. Too depressing.

i agree with you that no one can predict the future but i hold more weight for price predictions from people like this guy than a random redditor.
these people are at the top of the food chain for the crypto industry. they are interacting with institutional investors and other top people in the industry daily. they are seeing what is going on from a top level to see where the crypto market is going. that direction is up.

this is true. i run an ecommerce store. just google "stripe fees" or "shopify fees."

well if you're here, you probably think bitcoin's price is going up long term. there's volatility for sure but there will be a time when you are left in the dust while dollar cost averaging and you'll have to buy higher. that study just shows that historically lump sum is better than DCA. doesn't mean it's always the case, but historically and on a long time scale, lump sum is better.

Historically lump sum investing has outperformed DCA on a long enough time scale

I live in Seoul, S Korea and I hear people talking about bitcoin quite often. I'll hear the word bitcoin and look around and people of all ages are talking about. Young people, old grandpas, women. It's pretty surreal. Very bullish.

This sounds very interesting. When you say transfer a significant percentage of the btc, you mean after he sells and gets the cash, right? Or can you transfer btc?

You cant have it both ways where u want mainstream adoption and also the shoe shine boy not knowing about it. If u are invested into bitcoin, u know that mainstream acceptance/adoption will be coming some day. This is part of it.

Lol wouldn't you

we need all the advocates we can get
@_date: 2018-03-07 10:31:46
we're so lucky draper was the one who won the silent auction for the silk road bitcoins back in the day. what a great advocate he has been for bitcoin/cryptocurrencies now and in the future. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:00:11
good on you, man. congrats on the profit for real. some of us think that there is a long long way to go though. crypto is just beginning. i would put back in a little more exposure even if you think this is the top. who knows what can happen in the next 5 years. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:27:09
hes not scared. just ignorant and set in his old ways/thinking
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:32:19
what is your background? are you part of the wealthy upper class with a higher education background? would you say that most of the crypto community is upper class? if yes, do you see bitcoin education and awareness spanning all classes in Venezuela or still just upperclass?

@_date: 2017-10-16 18:20:12
