Isn't bitcoin basically the most fiat currency imaginable?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:47:08
You poor soul.
@_date: 2015-06-04 18:11:43
I believe in the concept of a block chain, just not bitcoin. Why is specifically bitcoin "the currency of the future"? Because it was the first one? Because people on this sub already have invested in it massively? Probably both.

ITT: People trying to explain why bitcoin losing 50% of its value overnight is a good thing.
This whole thread is fucking hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:44:30
I will learn that if you learn that if you disagree with someone's point, but have no arguement of your own, pointing out their grammar mistakes is childish.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:41:39
The bottom line is if you couldn't get the $1k in hand for your bitcoins than you cannot fairly say they are worth $1k.

Because people in North Korea and third world nationals totally have reliable internet access...
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:18:27
I am not doubting that bitcoin speculation has made people a lot of money, it certainly has. I just laugh at when people see bitcoin as a real world currency rather than a fad and a bubble.

Someone call an ambulance! I cut myself on the razor sharp edge of this post!
@_date: 2014-08-31 11:20:34
*strokes neckbeard*
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:03:02
Because BTC prices fluctuate wildly from day to day? Is this a real question?
@_date: 2014-04-01 04:51:39
Are you for real?
@_date: 2015-01-31 06:26:23
What I am saying is a major hurdle crypto-currency will have to overcome is that in every one we have seen so far, the early adopters instantly become the 0.001%. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 05:01:01
The title of the article is absurd. What about the people who got in on the ground floor and have thousands upon thousands of coins? This article is complete bullshit, bitcoin has WORSE financial distribution than any other currency. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 05:14:44
Is that really how you perceive criticism of BTC? People are skeptical of bitcoin, not the concept of crypto-currency. If you are too blind to see that you are just drinking the kool-aide. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 06:03:03
But based on the current model, whatever crypto-currency becomes "it" will have the EXACT SAME wealth distribution problems. Imagine if Doge-coin became "it". The people who adopted first would still be the holding the vast majority of the wealth. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:04:20
Well for one. Fiat currency is far more stable. 
Plus I don't remember any horror stories of people losing their life savings when their computer dies. 
Fiat currency can be used instantly. Anywhere. No need for an internet connection. I can give my friend $5 that he can use anywhere in the US and not need a computer/phone and wait for processing times.
Fiat currency is more anonymous. If you can connect a BTC address to a person, you can see everything they own and spend.
Does BTC have a place? Sure. But it will never replace it. Anyone who believes otherwise is drinking the kool aide. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:34:45
Is there no midpoint between investing your life savings in Internet Money (TM) and shoving cash in your mattress? Really? Is that what you are saying?
When was the last time the government tried to steal all of your money? Because it seems to happen all the time in bitcoin land. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:01:05
Keep telling yourself that buddy. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:09:19
Are you really saying the instability of BTC is preferable to the minor inflation of most fiat currencies? I don't even know what a bitcoin will be worth a month from now. Why would I spend them on the few things I can use them on? Unless I knew they would be worth less tomorrow. Which is.. inflation! Too much in either direction can ruin a currency. 
And if you are equating taxes to stealing, that is a whole different argument. Did you pay to have the internet piped into your house? Did you pay for the roads that take you to the grocery store? Did you pay for the police and fire departments that keep you safe? If you paid taxes on your fiat currency. Would you rather live in a bitcoin wonderland where every transaction is made online, and there are no taxes? Feel free to move into the middle of the desert. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 20:43:28
... I don't get it. You still aren't debating any of my claims just personally attacking.
@_date: 2015-04-15 06:12:37
Statist? Really? That is the best you can do to counter my arguments? I am as liberal as they come.  
By completely ignoring my arguments and resorting to ad hominem attacks you are basically saying "I disagree, but I don't know how to argue your points. So you are a dummy!"
Just because I don't believe BTC is the savior of mankind, that makes me an authoritarian stooge? Really?
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:23:22
What I was saying was NOT a direct criticism of BTC, but this subreddit as a whole being an echo chamber. So please don't call me "fussy" for stating the truth. The fact you are so defensive is alarming to me. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 16:44:09
Why is this being downvoted? Because it doesn't fit into your narrative of BTC being the savior for all mankind? This is the kind of shit that happens literally every day with bitcoin. This will never change. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:05:00
Keep making excuses. You know your argument is a straw man. Keep drinking that kool-aide buddy! 
@_date: 2015-02-03 04:23:32
This subreddit is really good at creating an echo chamber of what BTC holders want to hear. Everything remotely critical of BTC is downvoted to oblivion. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:47:33
If we don't acknowledge btc's problems, then they don't exist! /s
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:25:05
Credit card fraud is massive, yes. But with credit card fraud at least you have SOME chance of getting your funds back, as compared to btc where once the payment is sent, your coins are gone forever.
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:31:43
Not necessarily. I don't know many people who keep their social security numbers and credit card numbers on their computer. If they do then yes their identity can be stolen.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:42:05
The thing is thats what everyone is thinking. By the time you realize the bubble is about to pop its most likely too late.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:44:35
Bitcoin capture 1% of the transactions world wide? That seems like wishful thinking to be honest. Right now the average person has no interest, or use for bitcoins. 
Its your money, but I wouldn't risk that much in something so volatile as btc.
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:47:57
I wouldn't put too much stock i this. Bitcoin is in a huge deflationary bubble right now that can burst at any moment. Plus bitcoin is not accepted at nearly as many locations as most other currencies.
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:23:15
Good point. But no encryption is perfect, if your computer is compromised it is quite possible your gpg key and passphrase may be compromised as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:31:08
Thats not a fair comparison and you know it. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:20:56
Because of course anyone who disagrees with btc's viability must be a shill of the banks...
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:16:33
It may not be the best idea to store your coins in online wallets, but the fact remains if your computer where your wallet is stored is compromised the same risks remain. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:58:29
Wait what? Small business prefer bitcoins to credit card payments? Are they just making stuff up now?
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:26:23
Good point. But the buyer protection for bitcoin is essentially non-existant was my point.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:39:23
...seriously? how so? If anything it proved how impractical it is as a currency.
