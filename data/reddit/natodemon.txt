Would you happen to have a link to the London underground video? I've heard about most of the other ideas you mentioned but never paying for the tube with bitcoin.
I think the ability to lock funds for a time period as you mentioned could have some very useful purposes and is pretty much exclusive to bitcoin (and other Cryptos)

Wow well done to the British government for deciding against a Bitcoin ban. 


That is the kind of thing we want to hear from governments; it shows they aren't easily swayed by big corporations and their money.

I've just been trying to set this up on a linux box but I'm not sure how to configure ssh to use BitID for authorisation, your github readme file only explains how to login to telnet.
Thank you again for making this as I've been looking for an alternative to RSA keys for ssh login.

So the issue is with Cashila? If it isn't too hard to setup an account I'll give it a go and let you know if mycelium works or not.
Edit: I just setup an account and paired my mycelium wallet with it, first try, no issues.

I actually found your project in a comment you made on an older BitID post, it looks really interesting and such a great idea. Thank you for developing it and I will most definitely be testing it out on system soon.
@_date: 2015-12-21 12:27:24
Here's a video from one of the Mycelium developers:
The interface has changed a bit since then but the process is essentially identical. What you doing is taking the bitcoin in the cold storage wallet and sending it to your phone wallet, which could be referred to as a *hot wallet*.
This is known a *sweeping* and is the preferred method of using paper wallets as you don't reuse the cold storage address.

Perfect, thank you so much. I had to work out a few networking issues running it on a virtual system but now it's all up and running.

My argument was more for home internet connections, server farms are pretty much exempt from that. I've run a low spec VPS for a proxy project recently and damn are there connections quick!
I wouldn't say what you're doing is centralisation. Even if there were multiple nodes running under the same VPS provider I still wouldn't call it centralisation as the provider has essentially no control over that node. My interpretation of centralisation is if only a handful of nodes are functional and those are owned by large Bitcoin (or other) companies or if a large number of nodes are run by a large company. Said companies have a big influence over the Bitcoin network and could start abusing their power; not what we want.

APG or Openkeychain for Android. You can either copy/paste encrypted text into the apps or use the K9 email client as OP said for more integrated use. Personally I like the new gmail Inbox app so just copy and paste the small amount of PGP emails I receive. I've found that in some cases the apps are easier to use than desktop PGP programs so definitely not losing out on the mobile side.
Never been an iPhone user so not sure if PGP apps exist for them, you'd have to search.
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:36:28
The reason Gmail won't have end to end (PGP) encryption implemented for a long time is there would be no way for them to analyse your emails and display appropriate ads. This is what I've read from other comments on the topic but it makes sense to me. 
IIRC WhatsApp enabled end to end encryption between select android devices, I've not seen much proof of this but they have the ability to do this as their revenue doesn't come from ads.

I just noticed this while browsing Blockr.io. How in a time when we are debating an increase in block size can we process blocks that contain no transactions other than the reward? Any explanation would be welcome.
@_date: 2015-06-13 17:41:08
Haha no problem, the docs managed to get me up and running with telnet and I'm far from an expert Linux user. An SSH config file would be perfect though.

What's you're aversion to offline wallets? I understand that you lost BTC in the past but I imagine this was before hardware wallets became a big thing. The likes of a trezor or ledger wallet would make securely storing your BTC easy. 
While a mobile wallet would make it a bit quicker to access your bitcoin it would mean carrying the equivalent of ~€4000 (at current prices) in your pocket.
@_date: 2015-06-09 22:04:20
Just setup a full node on an RPi 2. Took a while to sync the blockchain but been working perfectly since then.
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:31:36
I believe that a blocksize increase is inevitable for the Bitcoin network to grow and I think the core devs know this fact, they simply don't want a rushed decision that could cause serious problems for Bitcoin as a whole. If more testing and analysis is performed I currently believe that a consensus of a 5 MB block could be reached because although there will almost definitely be an increase in the number of transactions, it will be a long time before they could fill 20 MB blocks.
Also one issue with your specific argument, as far as I'm aware Moore's law does not apply to home broadband. As a somewhat limited example I recently upgraded from an 8Mb down 1 Mb up connection to a 20Mb down 2 Mb up one. In the case of a full node the bottleneck would be the upload speed not the download and seeing as I was only bumped up by 1 Mb larger blocks could prove a real issue.
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:19:21
That is very true, most upload rates are much lower than download rates when it comes to home internet connections, I hadn't thought of that.
However I highly doubt that the network would jump from 1 MB blocks to 100 MB ones, and I'd imagine the transfer rates for a 20 MB block would be much more manageable for home broadband connections. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:55:31
What we are lacking here is information. Although we all have an interest in bitcoin, most of us have our own, a lot of us simply don't have the time to keep up to date with all the progressions and development constantly occurring in the network and ecosystem surrounding it. While it may be true that ~80% of the community is seemingly for the immediate implementation of larger blocks - I admit I would have voted the same way before reading this thread - how many of those votes are educated ones? It is so easy to convince someone that does not have a complete understanding of the bitcoin network works that bigger blocks = better, end of story; I was one of said people. A clear cut list of the pros and cons of larger blocks along with an explanation of alternative solutions would eradicate this knowledge deficit.
Although the current blocks can be quickly filled with an influx of transactions - as proven by the recent stress test - with current, normal usage the network is yet to suffer from severe backlogs. If what Greg stated is true, that in an emergency situation the block size could be quickly increased, the immediate concern shouldn't be with increasing the blocksize but addressing the highly worrying fact that the network was backlogged for around 5-6 hours by a very small number of users running scripts. I'm not going to pretend I know a way to solve this issue but it is one that most definitely needs to be looked into.
Are sidechains the solution to accommodating more transactions? I don't know, I need to find out more information but what worries me is how they would be implemented. I make most of my bitcoin transactions through a mobile wallet, how would a sidechain be merged into that? Making the use of the bitcoin any more complicated than it already is would only serve to reduce adoption if not relegate it to a small amount of enthusiasts that understand it.
Thank you Greg Maxwell for answering all these questions, this has honestly been the most informative thing I've read about this debate. There are always two sides to a story.
@_date: 2015-05-30 18:12:36
Block size increase is a definite yes. Just to avoid a bit of confusion the value for 100 MB blocks would be 1.33 megabits per second, I.e. the same as what your internet bandwidth is measured in (1.33 Mbps) 0.17 would be Megabytes per second. Its still a small fraction of what most homes receive now a days and an insignificant amount at server farms. I can see very few reasons not to increase the block size as soon as possible.
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:58:22
I wasn't trying to say that your argument is incorrect, you are right, bandwidth most definitely does progress (by Nielson's law as pointed out) I was mainly trying to clarify that it does not progress at the same speed as the rest of the computer industry. 
I think if we were to have a static increase to 20 MB blocks most nodes wouldn't have a issue catching up bandwidth wise, the issue would be if the block size is increased yearly at a rate faster than the progression of most upstream bandwidth connections. If it comes to that, another method of transferring blocks would have to be devised, possibly some sort of compressed block if that is possible.
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:12:12
The next major version of Bitcoin core is meant to implement pruning which, if I understand correctly, should reduce the current blockchain down from ~30GB to ~1.5GB rendering storage space a non issue. It won't however solve the issue of bandwidth, but even then, as many here have said, it will be a decent amount of time before we start seeing full 20 MB blocks.
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:50:07
I think many of the core devs will admit that a block size increase is necessary for Bitcoin transactions to continue working in a timely manner, their issue is rushing the block size increase.
Right now a large number of people are pushing for the limit to be upped to 20 MB without seeing the full picture or the possible problems it could cause (I was one of said people a few days ago) and while the limit does need to be increased, that doesn't have to take effect immediately. The stress test a few days ago proved that current blocks can be filled if the network is flooded with transactions, but that does not reflect the normal rate of transactions. 
The main problem I see that the core devs have is the sudden, irreversible nature of a hard fork and the kind of repercussions that a division in the Bitcoin community could have. Suggested solutions such as the lightning network - which I urge you all to look at - are not permanent if they prove unsuitable solutions and we still have the time to test them out.
TL;DR Fixed Blocksize increase is inevitable, but most definitely does not need to be immediate; there are other solutions that should be pursued first.
Edit: Word choice

It would be great if you could write up your notes on your experiences as I and I'm sure a lot of other people didn't think this would be possible, even now.

I tried syncing the blockchain myself on an RPi 2 but even with the --dbcache limited it doesn't seem to manage and I just ended up copying it over from my PC. It's a bit of a shame that the RPi can't do it alone but chances are that an RPi isn't your only computer.
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:15:51
Paper wallets are a pretty easy way to store Bitcoin securely as once you have the piece of paper it's like storing any other physical object of value: you put it in a safe. Many mobile wallets can now sweep paper wallets just by scanning the private key's QR-code.
The only issue with paper wallets is that they should be created on a secure machine, preferably some live linux distro that is disconnected from the internet; not an easy task for the average person. 
At some point I'm going to have to show my Dad how to withdraw and use his bitcoin and unless there is a major revelation in the hardware wallet scene I'll be sticking with paper wallets.

A Raspberry Pi 2 can run a full Bitcoin core node validation et all. During the recent stress test the 1GB of RAM proved a bit tight but it had only crashed once due to low memory and it has been running for over a month now.

Damn that's pretty sneaky. I'll go back sometime soon and tell him that if he used a mobile app it would be quicker and safer because although I doubt anyone here would do as you said with the QR code, using a single address meant I could see all his previous transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:13:46
I hadn't even thought of *watch only* address setups, that's a great idea if OP's friend wants to allow other employees to accept the Bitcoin payments as well.
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:56:23
NFC would definitely be a better alternative and mycelium does allow address transmission by it, but I've yet to use it once as even some android devices still don't come NFC enabled. 
I'm not too sure about Bluetooth though, the pairing process takes too long for a quick address transmission, many peripherals that use Bluetooth begin the pairing process with an NFC tag to speed up the process.
Essentially I think QR codes will have been a compromise as almost anything with a screen can display one.
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:05:22
I'd imagine quite a few of their features require modifies nodes, something they could more easily deploy on a server but would be much harder to develop for a mobile device. 
Also in a previous post one of the mycelium developers mentioned that the ability to connect to a random node or one of your choice was on their list of things to do at some point. They seem to be doing the best they can considering its not a paid app and don't have large funds available.
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:50:46
Ah that could be my issue, I've limited mine to 75MB. Did you happen to see the Max transactions yours held in the mempool during this stress test? I think mine topped out at about 40k txs; I was honestly amazed it held that many without crashing.
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:32:49
There hasn't seemed to be a need until now. At least we'll finally see some physical well, digital, improvements from one one of these stress tests.

BitID seems to be gaining a bit of traction and will hopefully continue progressing seeing as mycelium has just recently implemented it. It works seemingly in the same way as CLEF but uses BTC addresses instead of RSA keys. A system along these lines really does seem perfect as server side only the public key is stored avoiding the whole issue of passwords being leaked from hacking attacks.
@_date: 2015-07-10 08:53:43
It doesn't even need to be a *specialised* device, just a tablet or phone running the Bitpay or other payment processor's app would work fine and streamline the payment process greatly.

Ah pardon the gibberish, GCSEs are the exams taken at the end of year 11 in the British schooling system, one I believe is often highly regarded, but the same cannot be said about it's computing/IT department. Very few schools offer *computing* a subject that is meant to teach about the basics of programming, however as far as I'm aware learning a programming language and actually being able to code is not a requirement. 
I'm sure you and most others here have at least heard about the Raspberry Pi; it was created in order to try and rekindle the interest in programming and computing in the English and many other educational systems, but I have yet to see the effects of it.
Even a mention of the word *cryptography* would leave most students here dumbfounded, which is probably why Bitcoin is seen as something so strange and foreign.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:52:07
It could be shown as a suggested fee along with the default to give the user the option. I'm not too familiar with how other wallets work but in mycelium you can cycle between economy, normal and priority fees; a *suggested* option could be added that is an estimate of what it would take to be included in the next block.
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:55:05
Where the heck did you go to school?!? The most complex task the GCSE ICT course requires is a *nested if* function in Microsoft excel... Trust me when I say the name makes it sound much complicated than it is.
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:43:21
The issue is that this time the majority of the transactions are using the default fee, so unless you use a decently larger fee any transactions you make will get stuck with the rest.
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:21:35
I can attest that a Raspberry Pi 2 (1 GB RAM) will run a full node perfectly fine, my own one is currently up with around 35k transactions in it's mempool. I have limited the dbcache to 75MB but have made no changes to the default swap file which I believe is set 100MB. Yes that is in headless, CLI mode but to be honest a large amount of Raspberry Pi projects are intended to be run in headless mode.
That said even a small, outdated netbook would run a node much better and more reliably if it has been upgraded to 2GB of memory. The ultimate solution is of course a VPS but some of us can't turn down the ridiculously low price of a Raspberry Pi and its running costs :)
Ninja edit: I did have to download the blockchain on my main computer and transfer it to the RPi; it just cannot seem to hack that on its own.

@_date: 2015-07-12 11:44:02
I have not yet setup a Bitcoin payment system in a restaurant, but I've got a few friends who I'm thinking of recommending it to. I'd say the easiest and cheapest way of implementing Bitcoin is with a mobile device, either tablet or phone which you enter the bill amount into and it generates an on-screen QR code that can be scanned. 
Bitpay seems like a good option for the slightly less technically inclined as Bitpay stores your Bitcoin and can easily convert it into fiat. Alternatively you could also just setup a regular Bitcoin wallet (e.g
 Mycelium) on the mobile device, that way your friend has complete control over their Bitcoin. However they must know how to securely store the Bitcoin received; this arguable applies to the first option but it depends how much you trust bitpay.
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:09:44
That's what I'd surmised, I'm just surprised as it means BTCGreece's euro funds are essentially trapped in Greek banks along with everyone else's. Just looking now the price is only ~ €2 above Kraken's so actually a very good price and viable alternative to local traders who usually add a decently sized commission.
@_date: 2015-07-07 20:27:23
Are you at all familiar with working in Linux? Setting up a Raspberry Pi 2 to run Bitcoin core made for a great project and didn't take all that long. If not bitnodes look like a great product if you want to support this network without too much messing about setting it up.
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:16:27
I made my first purchase with Bitcoin in a physical shop just last week and it went a lot as I expected; one guy - who I assume was the shop manager - was called down to do the transaction. I *was* surprised however by the large *Bitcoin accepted* sign outside, along with the fact that the rest of the staff knew what Bitcoin was, they simply didn't know how to use it.
The way it was setup was quite basic, but it worked: a QR code was taped to the checkout desk which I scanned and entered in the amount that the manager had worked out on a calculator with the latest exchange rate. He then promptly ran upstairs to what I assume must have been a computer running Bitcoin-Qt to check that the transaction had gone through.
I was in a rush so didn't get much of a chance to talk to the guy but I believe we are still at the stage where the only stores that accept Bitcoin are ones where Bitcoin enthusiasts work, I'd imagine a lot of other staff just see it as a nuisance.

My own (European) node is still accumulating transactions, as is the block explorer Smartbit. I'll have to send a tx and see how long it takes.
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:20:07
I came across your block explorer from another post and had a look at it during the test. Yours was showing ~ 20k txs while tradeblock was still around 12k. At first I thought it was an error but as the transactions kept going up I'd say smartbit was more true to the actual state of the network.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:44:46
Pretty good article and as someone currently living in Spain, an interesting proposal. However I think one change might be worth making:


This is a bit misleading as with the current volume of transactions, txs sent without a fee would take many hours to confirm if they are included in a block at all. Amending this to state that a fee currently worth about €0.02 would avoid the confusion.
@_date: 2015-07-29 13:43:31

That is hopefully what stress tests like these will push wallet developers to include: an estimated fee for the transaction to be included in the next block. I've read that Bitcoin core already does this but I haven't tested it myself so I'm not sure if it works in situations like these.
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:49:16
I just opened up tradeblock.com and saw that the mempool is at ~12500 txs (14 MB). Is this another sort of transaction spam (stress test) or is there just an unusually large number of transactions today?
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:16:10
That's what I'd guessed as even though the price has gone up, it's not a major price jump. However, just from staring at Tradeblock's latest transaction feed it seems that most txs are paying the default fee with a good few including a larger one; if I'm not mistaken most stress test have used a below normal tx fee.
Edit: Actually scratch that, it seems there are in fact a large number of fee-less small transactions filling up the pool
