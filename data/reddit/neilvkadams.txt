This is Neil V. K. Adams, I can be reached at 1-888-886-6463.
You people can talk all the "trash" you want about me. 
Before you do just know that Canada, is not part of the Madrid System. (If all you fine people or lawyers "from" the "USA" do not understand this I could care less.) as seen:
That said... Canada is a member of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, a member of Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks.
Bottom line is it's not my fault that Mr. Mitchell Demeter a.k.a. "Bitcoiniac" does not know how to do business, good thing I didn't where my TOM FORD suit and looked like a bum with my Corey Hart's on that night. 
As well as Mr. Stuart Joseph Hoegner:
It's funny because on January 9, 2014 I had a very nice time speaking to:
Geneviève Côté
Director General, Trade-marks Branch
INDUSTRY CANADA
Trade-marks Branch CIPO
 
She said that Mr. Stuart Joseph Hoegner "open letter" seen above will now be returned to the senders address. Since CIPO does not accept any correspondence from someone who is NOT the APPLICANT or the owner of APPLICATION NUMBER: 1650461 as seen:
 
 
while the STATUS IS ONLY STILL BEING FORMALIZED!
 
Also when STATUS of the BITCOIN trade-mark application changes to ADVERTISED, pursuant to section 38. (4) of the Trade-marks Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. T-13) that 
 
If the Registrar considers that the opposition does not raise a substantial issue for decision, he shall reject it and shall give notice of his decision to the opponent.
 
Pursuant to section 38. (1) of the Trade-marks Act any person may "ONLY" then, on payment of the prescribed fee, file a statement of opposition with the Registrar
All B.S. aside I am not the guy you should care about case and point Winklevoss IP, LLC:
Thank you for your time and RESPECT and KEEP IT REAL!
Mr. Adams
