Well in that case it would be more then a $5 wrench attack

Get a secure wallet that you own keys to and it should be fine
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:00:49
Lol maybe in the states, not here
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:28:29
Dude it's way to early to put "vegas" and "knocking out" in the same sentence 
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:47:47
Spend it move the coin and keep $2500 aside incase it catches up to you, "oh I didn't realise it was charged back"

It's more of a donation for doing something creative, goes to show you can bake a mofo cake and scan it to pay.. this could lead to other bigger things in the future

The bitcoin itself won't change there will just be a duplicate of bitcoin that's claims it's the real bitcoin sound familiar? (Bcash) exchanges and hardwallets are already working on ways to split the coin safely, in short term bitcoin may drop. Either way if you hold both coins what do you have to lose? Whoever wins you will have the "real" bitcoin

From another angle each satoshi now represents another vast parallel universe of a different dimension we cannot see into but is full of space and solar systems similar to ours and even life forms.. from a cosmos perspective 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:56:59
It's a number between 0 and 2 billion

Just switch to legacy for that one transaction then you can send it to segwit address internally same problem with bittrex 
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:09:49
I don't think that's the right target of audience IMO
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:32:36
Boooooo you suck

May god have mercy, god works in mysterious ways. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:06:03
Maybe that's a good thing. Makes you have to do your research and if you can't obtain it then you don't deserve it there is 100s of ways not just coinbase

All transactions are held in "blocks" and when the blocks are mined (by the miners) they are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins i think it's 12.5 bitcoin released per block? And the reward is halved every 4 years to so it works out the last satoshi will be released in 2140... something like that
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:50:18
Like I said it doesn't matter because you have both coins, just make sure you keep them separated so they don't fight each other
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:53:49
Yes I wouldn't put my bitcoins in an Indian wallet instead I would put in a global wallet as bitcoin is decentralised and made to send globally but if it's stored in an Indian wallet it's centralised and become "Indian bitcoin"

Bread prepared for that split pretty  effectively too I was able to withdrawal bcash in a matter of weeks so I guess their the same, maybe I should just invest in a hardware wallet...
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:11:21
So you don't think they can just atomic swap all your btc for s2x btc?
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:56:09
Breadwallet is good, after 2 weeks of the hard fork (bcash) came out an update was released to withdraw all the bcash you had straight to an exchange of you're choice. Free money just for hodling btc
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:39:07

@_date: 2017-10-01 06:32:54
Could you please elaborate why Electrum?
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:47:25

@_date: 2017-07-23 04:36:26
Hope it moons in 6 months time that's when I'm withdrawing 
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:36:24
What would you recommend for a safe choice? Paper wallet? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:10:15
I looked at that site, looks pretty hard to navigate and there are some crazy prices I seen e.g bid $10000 for 0.01 btc, are they just bots you avoid?
