If you could make 50k just by sitting and taking a photo for 60 seconds, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:42:30


Yes they do... Your broker keeps records of all your transactions (of far less then 20k) and can be called upon by the IRS to verify that you paid your taxes. That's exactly what's happening here

Basically. R/bitcoin is full of delusional fanboys who never want to accept that there are negatives to bitcoin. R/bitcoinmarket offers a better more balanced perspective imo

You're missing the point. Its easy to say 'stay calm' when you're still in a profit. Try staying calm after you've lost 70 grand

less hype train and more actual news and analysis

And I never said anything about panicking.


This is such a dumb fucking phrase being repeated by teenagers in the subreddit.
If you are one of the few extremely lucky people who can lose all their investments and continue on with no problems then congratulations, you are a tiny minority
For most people, investments represent a big chunk of their financial worth, not to mention future financial goals.  Investments are there for a new car, a new house, retirement, a kids college fund, it represents a very real goal which people are working for.  If that gets wiped out, its not 'no big deal', its a major loss.  Sure they could still keep living as they were, buts the financial situation has changed.

Yeah... Linking the foundation the obviously has a vested interest in quark coin succeeding isn't 'proof'

Just because you can afford to lose 70k doesn't mean you should not care when you do
@_date: 2014-04-15 19:25:16


You should. Investments skyrocketing up should get just as much financial thought as when they're plummeting, both cases are signs of market instability and should be analyzed depending on the circumstances

If you think thats how the price is set then you know waaaaay less about bitcoin then you think.
I never said you had to freak out or panic, but at this point if you have any serious investments in bitcoins you need to be reassessing your financial position, doing anything else would be stupid.  You dont need to panic sell, or sell at all, you could keep all of your bitcoins, but if one of your investments drops to 1/3 or 1/4 its value over the span of several months then you would be an idiot not to reassess the situation.
Just because you can afford to lose the money doesnt mean you should never think about the situation or change it.

It's possible to do using workarounds but there's nothing built into Bitcoin that guarantees anonymity
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:21:24
Because nobody uses it as currency. Sure a couple people actually spend their Bitcoin, but the vast majority just buy it and hold.

Well to be honest, Joe Blow with his 10 grand isn't really a customer to a bank as large as BoA, they probably make tens of dollars off his money a year.  Their real customers are business bank accounts and people who have their house mortgage + whole life savings with BoA.
Not that I'm excusing BoA, i think they are a terrible bank.  OP if you read this, go to a credit union, best thing you can possibly do.

He had the balls to hold on after the 'first' big crash half a year ago. I probably would of panic sold then and still been happy with a couple million dollars. Of course in 5 years he could be looking in the mirror and saying '10 million dollars isn't cool, you know what's cool? 100 million'
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:32:35
Sorry but I disagree.  The whole point of having a bank account is you know exactly how much money you have at any point in time, that is, if you put $10 into a bank account you know that in a year you have $10 to pull out, the dollar devalued slightly, inflation, interest, etc but its about the same value.
If you put $10 into bitcoin you have no idea what it might be worth it a year, it might be worth nothing.  That volatility will keep it from being a 'savings vessel' until it is far more stable.  Any dispensary that chooses to put their bankroll in bitcoin is basically buying a bunch of lottery tickets.

I concur with this, if you agreed on .5btc then he maybe did the job with the expectation to have some btc to play around with and save.  If you agreed on $100 but just transferring it to him through btc then I'd say its fair to just give him $100 worth of btc.

You could always just put your coins into Coinbase and sell it to them, they will just deposit the USD into your provided bank account.  You have to remember to pay taxes on it though, if you turned $100 into $10,000 you owe 15% (I think?) on almost all 10 grand.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:59:14
Not really because coinbase and other companies have no incentive to offer you credit. credit card companies do it because they make interest on the debt you owe them. What if coinbase loans a user 1 btc and they don't pay it back?

Unless you are pretty well off, 16k would hurt any young person. With proper investment (i.e. not all in one commodity) that could be 300k when you're ready to retire
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:54:47
Seems legit to me. I can't afford it but good luck in your sale. Kinda crazy to think about that a year ago you could buy $20,000 worth of bitcoins and today its worth enough for a million dollar home

Id be interested in financing a bitcoin ATM in my city, although I have no experience in that sector.  Have you secured any sure-fire way to set these ATMs up? 3-15k is a pretty big margin, it seems like it should be a more defined price.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:53:29
Thats not a fantasy, thats exactly your right.  I wouldn't say it was because of their policy regarding bitcoin, I would say "Because you refused to transfer my money into another account of mine, for no legal reason".
What if you had family in Yemen or Somolia, would they have the right to refuse transferring money to an account there unless they personally vet its recipients? Ridiculous.
If you are transferring money I would recommend looking into local credit unions.  My personal credit union has been fantastic, and better then any bank I've ever dealt with or seen friends deal with.

Sorry if I'm going against the bitcoin circlejerk on reddit, but this is a terrible idea.  If one of your staff **explicitly** wants to be paid in bitcoin, then that is their choice.
For most people though, its pretty unnerving knowing that your 'paycheck' could be worth 75% of its value in the amount of time between getting handed it and getting home to put it in your bank account.  Bitcoin can swing up and down by several hundred dollars in less then an hour, if anyone actually wants to gamble with their income like that then more power to them, I still think its terrible financial advice.
What might be better would be paying a small portion of their check in bitcoin, like 10% or 5%.  But then again, if your staff wants 100% bitcoin, then they have no one to blame but themselves when they cant afford rent one month because the market crashed while they were driving home from work.

I have no idea what it would take to start an exchange but I would say if you didn't have an idea how to yourself then you've probably missed the boat.  There have been people playing with bitcoins for years so those are the guys who have already started the big exchanges.
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:22:19
extremely cheap bitcoins from a brand new reddit account. Yep, thats a scam
