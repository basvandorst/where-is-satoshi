Wow, since when has it been possible to create images with clickable links? That is so cool.

I donated 1.2 BTC to the Diaspora Project. That was around $16 at the time. 
I mined that BTC on a GTX 295.

What happens if this bcash altcoin/fork is a complete bust/failure?
Will the people behind it come back to core and try again?

Pirate Party here. 
Beyond that I think I'm a libertarian socialist. Voluntary socialism. I don't think we need to force it though, we don't need to fight for it or introduce it or anything like that. I think it will come all by itself, *as long as we have democracy, decentralisation and transparency*. 
We need more civil liberties, liquid democracy, bitcoin, bittorrent, free software, crowdfunding, social networking and free communication, open access to- and free use of information, faster internet connections, and so on. 
I believe the best way to fight for a brighter future right now is to fight for what the Pirate Parties are fighting for. Basically freedom of information and freedom of knowledge. The anti corruption, pro transparency, pro privacy and all that is great too though.

People would still pay for shit to get made, even if it was always legal to download any shit without paying. 
Just take a look at Patreon.com. People are voluntarily paying a subscription for shit that either way will be legally available for free. People are willing to pay for good shit to be made.

It would be great if Bitcoin became widespread while Apple still didn't allow it, so everyone switched to something with more freedom.

What we achieve with taxes can be achieved with voluntary payments instead. The internet allows this.

Getting rid of the former would eliminate copyright and patents.
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:18:09
Yeah I know. But I wasn't being completely serious. 
I actually think it will happen the other way around. Reforming copyright and patents and the introduction of Bitcoin and other technologies are going to make governments and capitalism obsolete. By capitalism I mean the private ownership of the means of production, so instead of a few rich people owning and controlling companies, being the boss of other people, the people who work at the company will own it, and control it through an efficient democracy achieved with modern technology. And we will govern the world ourselves with these same tools, instead of handing all the power over to a small group of people for four years. [Liquid Democracy]( would be a good start. 
We are just a couple of IP reforms and a few open source projects away from fixing all the world's problems (the rest of the world's problems will be fixed as a side effect of the gained democracy, technological development, free access to knowledge for everybody, loss of corruption and so on.)
@_date: 2013-04-06 10:58:36
If the Nation State ends, so does Capitalism. 
*Everything* will become decentralized. That means ownership of the means of production becomes decentralized too. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:29:06
I imagine people looking back, wondering how anyone could ever think state granted monopolies would be a good idea. 
And even if not quite that, we will surely change our view of "owning" something "intellectual", whatever that means.

Something that does the same as [Flattr]( but with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:20:32
Bitcoin ownership means you are the one in control of it.  
It's not "intellectual" but mathematical. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:20:05
It makes the company unnecessary, but not its function. 
Bitcoin allows a fee-less, decentralized, flattr-like system, but you will still need *something* to facilitate the micro-donations and buttons and so on.  
Maybe it could be build into the web. A webstandard for Bitcoin-flattr-like-easy-flatrate-micro-donations. Or a Bitcoin client that recieves an address when you click a button on the internet. 
Edit:  
There is of course still the Bitcoin transaction fee.  
And the point of this Bitcoin system being flattr-like, is that you only pay a flat rate each month/week/whatever, and that it is *very easy* to decide to support someone. Like just a single click on a button and nothing more.

@_date: 2013-05-27 07:19:29
Imagine everyone using the same decentralized, anonymous, easily searchable, seeding incentivizing, comment/tag-able bittorrent network. 
Like what Tribler is trying to do. 
@_date: 2013-01-29 13:41:14
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:40:49
Yea, maybe. But even if that was true, even if a few upstarts actually manage to benefit from the patent system, it doesn't outweigh the bad it causes.
We can directly see the damage the patent system causes, but we can't really know if it has any positive effect at all, like in the big picture, because that would require looking into an alternate universe where they weren't introduced, or something like that. We could abolish patents and see if things improve, or look at the time before patents, but that wouldn't prove anything, would it?
We should get rid of patents, since that would mean we get rid of their side effects, and then if we need to create more incentive to invent, we should do it in a way that doesn't have any negative side effects. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:28:20
Why is that Bitcoin's true potential?

Copyright is ensuring old works where the author is gone or unreachable will not be digitized and shared, and thus lost to time when the physical storage erodes. Orphan works. 
The same would apply to hobbyists in possession of an obscure file. Copyright would keep them from digitizing and sharing it with the world. 
*Edit:* So an important point of the future bittorrent network is that everyone uploads everything. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 18:14:17
If file sharing was legal, no file would be hard to come by.
