When the chain splits and you are on both chains because you're a HODLer. :)

I don't think any of the (serious) proposed solutions would centralise Bitcoin too much. At least not in the long term.

The sad thing is that they call Core developers the same in the other sub. It doesn't convince anyone. Quite the contrary.

If so, then they are in a good position IMHO. Status quo is easy to maintain because there is a large number of players who wouldn't support any changes. If SW supporters do something (e.g. UASF) they risk ending up on the shorter chain. If say, 30% of the nodes, 20% of the exchanges/wallets and 10% of the hash power start rejecting non-SW signalling blocks that's not gonna end well for them. Hope I'm wrong though.

the chart shows the impact of the future fork. In the rightmost part bitcoin has two prices: Bitcoin Core is falling while Bitcoin Unlimited is already at zero.

For average users who are not involved in the technical this is not so obvious.
They have Gavin for example, and they also have some arguments that can't be refuted without going into the technical details.

It's not centralised if they have to cooperate so extensively but at the same time they have very different views and interests.
Or if it is, then it was centralised at the time of the HK agreement too.
