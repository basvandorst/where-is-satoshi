I'm not into day-trading either but there it would be a very big problem if the price went to zero overnight just because some big player like MtGox makes a bad move. That doesn't worry you at all?
Are you mining, accepting them as payment for goods or straight up buying them? I think that if I received them for some sort of job or product that I wouldn't be as worried but a lot of people are buying them from exchanges and such and if they get burned I'm pretty sure their support for any other virtual currency would disappear, which would suck :-(

That's one of my worries too. I'm not the most computer literate but when compared to my peers I'm way ahead of the gang and even I fumbled a few coin early on due to a computer crash and another time falling victim to a scam. With more fraudsters popping up in the news and now sites that promise a % return just to house your coins with them I just know others will fall victim and get a very bad taste for bitcoin/alt-coins altogether. Are you in favor of pseudo-regulation or do you want it to remain decentralized?

What you fail to realize is that most 'revolutions' in history were funded by banking families. Just read some books instead of reddit and you can figure out who those families were. I won't spoil it for you.
You also fail to realize that TPTB have more 'money' and wealth than you could ever imagine. Collectively, they own the majority of this planet's real assets and infrastructures. They also fund the very businesses in places like silicon alley that invent the technology necessary for you to mine these virtual currencies. You could unite every single bitcoin fan/supporter in the world and as a whole, still wouldn't hold a flame to these people. At any given moment they can move in (assuming they already haven't) and control the market just like they control the stock market, housing market and others. They will manipulate the prices up or down and unlike you and most, will make money on either direction. Take a look at the Silver market alone and the blatant suppression of its price. That should be evidence enough that the power is not in our hands when it comes to technology. How about that latest Comcast news buying Time Warner for 45+ BILLION USD. My advice to you is to stop living in denial. bitcoin is not a good investment. It's a good tool as a means for trading and that's it. As long as people remain emotional and think it's a 'revolution' it will never stabalize because quite frankly, most people are idiots and will allow these people rape them of their wealth like they have done time after time again.

Yeah you're right, how dare I point out that bitcoins have no intrinsic value. HOW RIDICULOUS! Get a brain and learn how to read between the lines.

"This issue first became known in 2011"
MY QUESTION: If this has been known about since 2011 then why the hell has the issue not been fixed?? What hope do we have if a team of 'core developers' still can't get this resolved??
JFC! This news just keeps getting worse IMO!
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:48:11
But can this problem be solved without a central authority?
I was caught off-guard by MtGox's statement when they started mentioning the 'Bitcoin core development team'. Who the hell are these people? Could they be considered the central authority? What if they are the ones participating in the transaction malleability.. Screams red flag to me.
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:37:17
Oh snap, thanks for the BOA link, I've gotta spend time reading that tonight. I don't disagree with your assumption entirely. The part I'm concerned about is trade volume. Surely the price/value would tank if no one is actually trading or spending it, right? Those winklevoss twins already have over 1% of mined coins and I'm sure they won't stop there. They claim to have never spent a single mB and I'm sure there's other early adopters out there that are in a similar position (we just don't know because it's spread across addresses). When these players eventually sell for whatever reason would that signal the end of the currency? Would we be dependent on their moves? I think the only reason why BTC is where it is today is because people were actually using/spending it and moving it around. If that action stops or slows down because of people hoarding based on speculation don't you think it would have a negative effect on the price?
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:22:14
I totally agree when it comes to technology adapting to provide for better security. It blows my mind to see so many people hoarding their coins online. When I read these articles about massive amounts of coins being hijacked I am floored. I get worried when I have 1 BTC stored on an exchange or on my PC and find myself reading more and more about cold storage techniques. Why on earth would big time investors not do the same? Regardless, let's say someone on Coinbase loses a chunk of coin (like was recently reported) should we say shame on that user for not taking the necessary steps to protect themselves or should Coinbase be responsible? If the company isn't held responsible what's to stop the company from stealing from their customers and saying hey, tough luck!?

Are you holding because you're speculating the price will go higher or because you're treating it like a bank account for regular transactions that you will continue to make?

@_date: 2014-02-11 04:17:02
Awesome, I really appreciate your response. I also like your term of 'Panic Holding'. Can I use that one day? ;-p
I have also read similar articles about US agencies having a sort of blind-eye stance right now. It will be interesting to see what happens by the end of the year once the people who have been arrested in the US make it through the legal process. I really hope that these people prevail. That senate hearing that recently occurred sounded pretty promising but it seems like Wall Street is concerned and I wish I could remember the quote but in short they sounded like it would be next to impossible to run an alt-coin exchange or start-up in NYC. What happens in NYC doesn't bother me per-say but I'm worried that even if alt-coins take off it may end up being like the whole POT debate where it's legal to use in some states but deemed illegal by the federal gov. This would be a travesty because it would drive alt-coin start-ups out of the US, weaken security/protection and straight up stifle innovation while the rest of the world marches along into the future.

Dude, Overstock has publicly mentioned they are immediately exchanging at Coinbase... Therefore your BTC WILL go to an exchange...

Do you think these crashes are engineered so that the big money can shop at a discount? 
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:59:51
What else has made 500%+ gain in the span of a couple months? These people who regulate markets make money on the way up AND down so now that i'm seeing not one, not two, but multiple swings in price I'm a little concerned that they may already have infiltrated the market and are at the wheel. Early adopters and people that truly believe in the technology would not be so quick to jump the shark based on news stories and busts... right? Who is driving the market down so much if it's organic?
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:10:50
Yes, I think it isn't a good idea. If you're into losing your hard earned money then have at it by all means. If you enjoy not physically owning what you invest in then go for it. If you value websites over land, gold &amp; food then you deserve to starve both frozen and penniless. 
Perhaps you haven't been paying attention to the news where it's being reported that thousands if not millions have been without electricity for not just days now but weeks. Do you think these folks give a damn about bitcoin or twitter? I shouldn't have to explain to you the difference between a hard asset and a digital holding. You can do your own research and make your own decisions and mistakes. Enjoy your bits, I'll enjoy my grits!

Can you tell me why you think it will go above 10K? People said the same thing about Gold a while back and it ended up tanking about 700$. Silver followed a similar fate from 50 down to 19. I remember all these 'financial advisors' and such on YouTube pumping the hell out of metals saying the same type of stuff that others are now saying about Bitcoin. Yes I believe in the technology but let's be realistic... what on earth would propel it to 10K/coin? Who would be buying in at that point considering it could flash crash like it has in the past? Just curious... thanks
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:39:41
But what's the point of holding it till you die? I don't get it...
If you could eventually buy a farm with your BTC why on earth would you pass? Doesn't everyone have their price? What happens if your local currency becomes worthless and you need it to live? Surely the money masters could engineer such a collapse to force you to transfer your wealth (or perceived wealth) into their hands...
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:11:06
People have already purchased large(r) assets with bitcoins. It's use of a currency is not debatable. I'm contesting your idea that it's a a safe place to 'save' your money. Savings accounts historically provide customers with a return (not a loss). If a bank were to lose people's savings based on speculation like bitcoin then they would be out of business.
That being said I'm not insinuating that banks are innocent and don't play with people's money in other ways. Fractional reserve banking is designed for this purpose alone. I'm focusing on things like 'savings accounts' and 'cds'. The only loss most people incur is due to the hidden tax of inflation but that's usually due to wreckless governments that its citizens allow to print endless amounts of money. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:11:58
People like this posting such nonsense are the reason why bitcoin will ultimately fail
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:54:26
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2014-02-11 06:16:39
Yes, but if what MtGox's claims end up being true then all of the other exchanges (and most other alt-coins) will reach a similar fate. This doesn't concern you at all? What if next Monday Coinbase halts all withdrawals and claims the same? There's so much animosity towards MtGox for other reasons and because this happened I think people jumped the gun and started talking even more shit just for the opportunity to take business from them. How do we know what they say is false? Just because people at Coindesk say so?
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:27:17
Yea but it's not just that one exchange is falling apart. It was THE exchange. Aside from miners, I'd bet that a lot of early adopters have done business with them at one point in time. They're what the MSM uses to index the price. I'd say it's akin to a Merrill-Lynch insolvency... hard to take lightly IMO
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:59:45
The actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value including all aspects of the business, in terms of both TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE factors. This value may or may not be the same as the current market value. Value investors use a variety of analytical techniques in order to estimate the intrinsic value of securities in hopes of finding investments where the true value of the investment exceeds its current market value.
BITCOINS ARE NOT TANGIBLE.

I agree with your Gold and Fiat remarks. However, aren't there harder to mine alt-coins out there? 42Coin type stuff? If virtual currency is the future for wealth storage don't you think the connoisseurs would be interested in something like that? Gold and Silver are pretty rare when you take the time to assess it. Even little trinkets and jewelry that I used to see in abundance as a kid have been disappearing. All I see now is crap being made in zinc, stainless steel, pewter... Even Quark coin looks appealing with all the extra layers of security. With all this fraud going on i'm suprised it hasn't taken off like litecoin or even Dogecoin.

@_date: 2014-02-11 03:48:07
I'm concerned about the dollar as well. However, that's controlled by the money masters (bankers) and their scam was pulled off so well that 100 years have gone by without it being picked apart by the world at large and it's still treading along. Don't you think they could easily jump into the BTC/alt-coin market and either take it down or straight up control it? (example: winklevoss twins ETF)
I'm pretty sure that even if we all combined efforts that we would not be able to compete with the type of ascii liquid-cooled server farms they could build (and quite possibly may be what's needed in order to mine the last chunk of coins).

bitcoin is not a viable store of value. It's volatile and speculative at best.
