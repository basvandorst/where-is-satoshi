This is exactly why I am glad I am at the point in my life and career that I am completely financially stable. I have no debts, I like my job and I make a decent salary to live comfortably, travel, and do the things I want. All the money I have in crypto is money I don't need regardless of how much it goes up. So life won't cause me to sell off anything, and I will let what I have in it ride until I am ready to retire. 
I knew about bitcoin when it first came out in 2009 and I thought it was really interesting. Life got in the way and I never had time to sit down and figure out mining. I could have millions now if I would have taken the time, but that doesn't bother me now. The fact is, I did go through hard financial times and was younger and dumber, so even if I would have gotten myself bitcoins when it was basically worthless I most likely wouldn't have any left today. 
Don't kick yourself for the past. Nobody had any idea that bitcoin would be worth this much today even just a year ago. Keep looking forward and watching for new opportunities.

Wow, looks like weed prices have been pretty stable for the last 20 years. I was paying $50 for an eighth of good "kind bud" back in the 90's as well. Good to know that some things never change :)

That's what I was thinking too. My college days would have been much better if 20 bucks got you all that in 98.
20 bucks was the price of an 8th of shitty brick weed at that time. I have no idea what college kids pay for a shit bag of weed today. Does brick weed even exist anymore, or is it all nice fluffy nugs all around?

Pay that loan off ASAP. Then you are free and clear of debt. It could all crash and go away tomorrow, and you'd still have to pay back that loan. Once you get the banks off your back, then your gains are truly 100% yours, and if then it all crashes at least you won't have banks breathing down your neck.

Best of luck to you man. And here's hoping that the upcoming fork doesn't crash btc and cause you major financial troubles.

If you believe that it still has room to grow, then it's never too late to buy. I bought at an ATH just 5 days ago, and now I am already up on that purchase by 17%.
