I'm running mine on a Rock64 but was unable to install LN....

Well, I was following a tutorial and although my node works ( at least it appears at bitnodes) I encountered some errors while installing LN...

Don't know how that stuff works.... Sure this place is cheaper to rent than Larios Centro, Málaga Plaza or Plaza Mayor.
So, it's a good starting point!

Is it possible to switch from one wallet to another by using the passphrase? Ledger to Trezor for instance?

The issue is you don't see neither the balance nor the new address. If you check the hash, everything looks fine but you don't see the balance anywhere in Ledger Live mobile.

That BTC ATM is located at the Centro Comercial Málaga Nostrum. Not a quite popular or crowded place to be honest but still it's ok. There are a lot of people who go there for shopping and cinema. I mean, it's not old town but it's ok.

Trought mobile, try to send some sats to a different wallet ( I did to Mycellium) and then check the amount sent and your balance left.
In my case, as I had to create a new account, the whole balance was kept in one single address. THEN I sent 50€ worth of btc and at the end, history shows I send 450€ worth of BTC. However, desktop version shows the right amount ( 50€ worth of Btc). 
It happened at least to me, twice!

According to Andreas Antopoulos, those are the ones with the port 8333 opened but there are thousands that have this port closed. What I don't know is the porpuse of nodes that are not listening to the network. Any guess?

Thanks for your answer. It actually has SATA and just bought a 500gb ssd for it. I hope it works! Why would you use hhd instead ssd?

Why should I be worried about that issue?

I had the same issue. Everything went fine until I saw my ticket showed zero everywhere. I called to the phone number that appeared at the ATM and It was a matter of minutes that I receivesld my btc.

I see... So do you think it would be smart to move from Ledger Live to Mycellium?
@_date: 2019-09-08 20:30:45
Why not Mycellium??
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:03:42
So, what should I do now? In case it doesn't arrive in a few days, how can I boost it?

Hi guys which ln wallet would you recommend me?
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:04:24
That's cool. In running a couple of Iota nodes and would like to run LN one. Is there a tutorial for that?
