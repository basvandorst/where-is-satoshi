The site worked for me as well. Bought $25 worth.

I know everyone is weary of this, but FWIW, the site worked for me. I think they have a couple of design flaws, which caused my order to be delayed for a few hours. Support resolved it immediately upon contact, and my .05 btc was in my wallet within 5 minutes.

I think that's still up for debate. At least, I hope it is.

These are good points. I'll edit my FB status accordingly.

Update - I gave away ~40 USD worth of BTC today, and generated some new interest. 
Mission accomplished!

My friends list is full of libertarians who have heard of BTC, but hadn't used it. 
I got a lot of responses and requests, but only from other libertarians, unfortunately.

It's still going. People are asking some questions about wallets &amp; trading. I've sent BTC to 5 people so far.

Yes, I will continue to buy. Dollar cost averaging is your friend in this market.
