We need only one version of bitcoin and it's this one.

Like I pointed out, there is much more to bitcoin apart from its scarcity. 
Bitcoin is a much superior vehicle of transferring value for the following reasons
1) It is not restricted and limited by borders and geographical barriers, it's a global network.
(Fiat money is limited to the respective governments territory that issues it and gold cannot be used as currency either)
2)With Bitcoin you don't have to trust you anybody, it is the only peer to peer network that facilitates transfer of value. With Fiat money and digital gold you heavily rely on third parties, pay commissions and get restricted by their rules and regulations.
3)With bitcoin you are your own bank, you and only you can access your funds and decide to move them. Most of the Fiat money owned by people is stored in banks, once you deposit that money into a bank that money is no longer yours (search about cash reserve ratio's, fractional reserve banking and printing money out of thin air)
4)The bitcoin network cannot be censored and transactions are irreversible unlike the case with Fiat money where your bank can reverse transactions and even freeze your account.
5)bitcoin cannot be counterfeited because its ledger is transparent and immutable. Fiat money is counterfeited all over the world, gold has an artificial supply too. Digital gold and paper gold are not backed up with 100% reserves. Paper receipts for  gold have always been printed out of thin air through out human history.
   After all these qualities comes scarcity which makes bitcoin the best store of value.

Yes, that's right. The original idea of bitcoin is an investment asset, not a payment instrument

Too bad for those who didn't have a patience and sold them all!

I would like to add to this, why we stopped using gold was because it was much easier to carry (IOU's) pieces of paper which were receipts of physical gold ownership. These pieces of paper could redeemed for gold anytime from respective banks and thus they were considered to be equivalent to gold. This is how the concept of paper money was born. But history kept repeating itself till date, it was almost as if fractional reserve practice was inherent in the genes of humanity. Banks always printed more money (more gold IOU's/more gold recipients) than there was gold to back up,assuming only a few people will redeem their gold at a given time. After a point it would become too obvious that banks are printing money out of thin air and the whole system would collapse and get back to square one. Latest example of this was when president Nixon of USA (back in 1971)  took the world off the gold standard and gave birth to petro dollar, the Fed printed way more currency than they had gold to back up. They sort of cheated the world.
 Even today, every ounce of gold will have more than 1 owner. This can never happen with bitcoin, thanks to the transparency it brings in and credits to its immutable Decentralized ledger. Bitcoin is scarce, and will always be scarce and have the same supply. Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited. 
Bitcoin is censorship resistant and with bitcoin you are your own bank!
