Lols. It was a joke. Suck a dick, Judy.

i just don't feel comfortable plopping down $341 for one BTC, especially after the $200 bubble popped.  
i'm not a BTC total noob.  i've been following since $12.  i just never really trusted it i guess...

tha fuck is a bitcoin day?
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:26:29
oh, yeah, i get it.  but that doesn't change the fact that you're buying at the highest ever traded...

this is my favorite part:
i'm a heavy contributor and curate a few bands on archive.org.

I'm very interested in Bitcoin. But like you said. This stuff is just keeping me too confused, so I'd rather stay away. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:17:51
but it kinda is... remember the $200 bubble pop?  why should i buy at $340?
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:06:38
good explanation.  thanks!

what about all the theft that's been going on?  
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:31:11
right.  i get that.  but remember the freak out when everyone's BTC dropped in USD in half almost overnight?  
what's pumping this rally?  eventually it's going to pop again.  might be tomorrow, might be at $1k... who knows.  but the higher it gets in USD, the less comfortable i feel about buying.  i think that's natural.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:18:31
i'm not saying it's over...  it's just not worth jumping in right now "for me".
i wish i did back in the $12 days.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:18:43
well, i do just keep contributing to my 401k regardless.  2008/2009 sucked balls but this year is rockin.
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:32:23


so...  what does "losing bitcoin days" mean exactly?  the bitcoins are still in circulation.  i would think that's a good thing, rather than LOSING bitcoins like a losing a wallet to a crashed drive or something.

truer words might never have been spoken.
