Quickly everybody google bitcoin and keep hitting refresh

I tried to buy something off their website the other day. The checkout page list btc as a form of payment but you can't actually click the field. I contacted support and they said they are not accepting bitcoin currently. My guess is fees are too high currently.

I live in Toronto, the 4th most populous city in North America! Its been in the news constantly with new merchants accepting them and ATM's popping up country wide. Its trending among the younger generations although these are the people that don't hold the purchasing power and can't afford it. In the developed world I expect the numbers to be significantly higher, if we are comparing on a global scale, then yes I'm sure most people in Zimbabwe or 3rd world countries have yet to hear of Bitty.

Couldn't agree more. You're making the rest of us look bad.

Seems fabricated to me. I'm basing this on personal interactions with people in my city, I would say that more than 75% of people have heard of Bitcoin, its just that probably less than 10% of these people actually understand its fundamental underlying principles and how to acquire it.
