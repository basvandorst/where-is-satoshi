Thank you for this. It is very insightful. I'm still addicted to checking prices though :/

Ahhh the good ol reverse psychology. If we say its bad for BTC, then the regulators will rush to approve it.

How can something decentralized be "systematically oppressing" a group? Grow a brain.

The problem is that before, there were not any Senate hearings on Bitcoin. We now have old men who know nothing about the technology trying to create regulation for it. Don't you see the danger in this?
Now it has grown so large that it has become a target, instead of something that could be swept under the rug. That is the problem.

I don't see why he is getting downvoted. No one knows for sure what BTC will do. It may well be a dead cat bounce.

Becuase I buy low and sell high.
Becuase I like making money. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:21:27
I think you are part of the problem the guy is completely right. This Lambo moon and blind hodling going on is what makes the rest of crypto take bitcoin seriously. That's why it takes so long for it to go to the moon, HODLers seeing no-coiners not investing is stupid.

Kind of tin foil hat-ish... But also may be possible.

Financially, you should buy back in now.
But I don't think you should, as you would likely repeat this dumb mistake sometime in the future and have even greater losses. Just get out of the crypto game, and spend your fiat.

Ah, now the positive news to prep the masses for FOMO.

Things are actually pretty balanced so far. Feeling slightly bullish. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:24:17
Let them think what they want. 
It is not your business to convince someone else's family what to think about bitcoin.

This is like saying the internet is bad because you can use it to buy fentanyl and other drugs. 
Or Microsoft is bad because it is the preferred OS of terrorists, terrorists who KILL PEOPLE.

Ah, shut out the competition to build their own.

No GVT mentioned... really?
The whole point of GVT is to have passive income invested by a money manager with profits distributed via smart contracts. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:44:47
It does now.

You seem to place a lot of blame on your friends for having "better connections" as for why you feel they are ahead of you...
Maybe you are bad building connections with important people? "i even went to a private school to get better qualification and a diploma but i still can't get better jobs"
Did it ever occur to you that being smart doesn't matter if people don't like you?

China will either adopt Bitcoin and cryptos, or lose out to Korea and Japan.
China does not want to lose out to Korea and Japan.

Why is it a good idea to give every person over eighteen $1,000 ever month? Where is that money going to come from? 
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:41:29
A lot of precursor chemicals and reagents for drugs actually do come from China though...

If they pursue this option, it may last for quite some time. But inevitably they will fail so long as they have an export-dependent economy.

Kim Kardashian has 58M Twitter followers. There are [24]( BTC wallets.
Her following in Twitter is almost 2x the entire BTC wallet population, not to mention her other social medial outlets.

How much lower can it go???
More room to long and take profit from pumping than shorting IMO.
