They are and I can see how it might be not so easy to make Bitcoin work with their business model since there isn't such a thing as 'withdrawal' or *debit* with current Bitcoin wallets.
Maybe there's a web wallet service that enables companies to plug in and then transfers the bitcoins whenever the condition in question (in this case, the release of a new blog post/YouTube video/whatever) is fulfilled?

No it's not! The "computer" (which really is a global open-source network for resource tracking and allocation - **precisely** what the Blockchain invention enables for the first time in history) only makes sure the outermost barrier for sustainability doesn't get breached, i.e. that humanity overall doesn't use up the planet's resources at an unsustainable rate and quicker than they replenish or get recycled. Everything within the bounds of sustainability is open and free. Technology is just used to make political decisions about resource use in a scientific and efficient manner, for example *Let's calculate what would be the best and most efficient infrastructure layout for this new district we need to build given all the requirement factors we have.* This methodology is already a school of design that **[gets more and more traction]( and a Resource-based Economy would only strive to push this further and have big political decisions be made more on the basis of scientific reasoning (that includes resource use, efficiency, population happiness and hundreds if not thousands of other factors) and less on arbitrary whims of a small group of politicians.
There has been a lot of FUD and misrepresentation in the last years about The Zeitgeist Movement and a Resource-based economy (and frankly there has also been some miscommunication given that TZM is not a company but an open movement and because the concepts and details of a Resource-based economy are still being conceptualised, discussed and developed) but I encourage anyone to read up on the most recent materials about this. I consider myself a left libertarian and I'm in full support of a resource-based economy! In fact if we don't learn to align our resource use with the planet's capacities we're utterly fucked very soon!

Bitcoin.de trading currently works peer-to-peer on the fiat side and thus is non-realtime. When I buy Bitcoins from someone there, I wire them the Euros and as soon as they receive the money (which can take 1-3 days) they'll release their Bitcoins (which Bitcoin.de keeps in escrow) to me.
Currently Bitcoin.de are working on a system that lets every user have a proper bank account with Fidor Bank that is then used for all Bitcoin trading - which in effect enables realtime trading since all fiat transfers can happen immediately within Fidor Bank.

I think you're mistaken about what a resource-based economy would look like in practice - and I can't blame you because it has been communicated in a horrible way many times. It its core is **not** a giant computer that tells everyone on Earth what to do, it's rather a **train of thought**, a principle of applying the [scientific method]( to societal problem solving. Peter Joseph and other TZM activists have (especially in recent years) talked about how the practical implementation of the information infrastructure etc. would have to be a decentralised network built on a cooperative protocol like the internet (even better - Bitcoin).
Science by its very nature is competitive - concepts and ideas get tested, recreated, falsified, verified and improved upon or refused altogether based on their scientific validity.

After three months I switched back to Android and now I wouldn't want to use any other mobile OS than stock (**!!**) Android.

I did refute it but it doesn't seem like you were too intent on finding the nuances.


Those boundaries of sustainability will be upheld either way - either through us fucking up our environment and ecosystem to the point where it's uninhabitable to us or through some massive change in culture where we understand and respect the planet's resource limits.
"Science" is not just another person like a communist dictator is, it's just the methodology by which we discover and understand the physical laws of nature. If you want to be dramatic we all live under the dictatorship of physical reality. You can deny it but it doesn't change anything - you can't use more of anything than is available and when what is available starts to become less than you actually need to survive, you'll die.

I'm a big fan of several artists and content creators that use Patreon to monetize their work, for example the high quality video game critique channel **[Errant Signal]( just to name one.
The idea behind Patreon is to support artists on a regular basis that's in line with the schedule and frequency of their particular content releases, something Kickstarter and other established crowdfunding platforms which focus on single large amounts for single projects aren't really suited for.
YouTubers, bloggers etc. are a great example.
So I asked Patreon if they plan on accepting Bitcoin and they replied with this email. Does anybody know how they could implement Bitcoin to work with their business model of recurring payments?

Trading happens from private bank account to private bank account. If you buy bitcoins there, you wire the € to the bank account of the seller. Once they receive the money, they release the bitcoins and you have them in your Bitcoin.de wallet.

@_date: 2015-07-14 12:17:43
That's the thing - you **do not add production value simply by adding in epic music**! That's not how filmmaking works. It's a beginner's mistake I see commonly in film students; they think adding a Hans Zimmer soundtrack under a mediocre video edit with questionable colour filters and cheesy graphics will elevate their film to Hollywood level. That's not the case.
A more low-key production that keeps production quality solid and **consistent** instead of masking its low budget by adding flashy gimmicks that they can't afford to do right will always have way more credibility.
As a filmmaker I meant this as constructive criticism and didn't mean to aimlessly shit on the film, as you seem to suggest with your "you can do better than that". I genuinely felt like the trailer was at least a third too long and that it could have been edited much tighter and more concise.

Capital 'B' Bitcoin means the Bitcoin blockchain. Lowercase 'b' bitcoin is a unit of the currency running on the Bitcoin blockchain.
A cryptocurrency using a different blockchain is not 'Bitcoin'.
That's my understanding.

@_date: 2015-03-01 11:52:34
I'm not sure what this changes. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how *polycentric law* works?
To me it seems that this doesn't really change the underlying basis of the rule of the majority, it just means smaller jurisdictions. Instead of having laws for an entire country you'd have laws for a city or a district or a guild house inside a city but inside those respective jurisdictions you're still subject to the rule of the respective majority.
@_date: 2015-03-01 14:41:08
That would mean that every single piece of land, every stretch of river, every litre of ocean water every molecule of the atmosphere would have to be someone's private property? Otherwise who would protect the environment?
@_date: 2015-03-01 11:13:14
You disagree with the idea of the majority rule even if it were true **[direct democracy]( without corruption, election rigging and other perversions of the principle?
I'm not sure I understand how that could make any sense when taken to its logical conclusion. So you'd want a single individual in your community to be allowed to act in any way they see fit even if that hurts the vast majority of that community?

What's a consensus? In a democracy consensus is generally understood as the majority of the electorate agreeing on a certain decision. What are you talking about then?
A society where every single decision is agreed upon by 100% of the people? Correct me if I'm wrong but to me this appears entirely unrealistic.

No. I believe in decentralised syndicates i.e. small jurisdictions so anybody can move from one to the other as they please.
Within a given jurisdiction/syndicate/community however I believe the only sensible and realistic way to provide order is a direct democracy where the majority vote would decide the law. 


I'm not sure I understand the question as I'm not familiar enough with the methodists and baptists.


Yes, constantly. If we decide to go out for food, we vote where we want to go. Unless I agree with the majority vote I'm out of the group for at least the duration of their lunch at the place they decided on. Now I'm vegan and usually in the minority, so I'm happy that my friends are often considerate enough to include my minority case into their considerations and agree to go to a place that provides a vegan option. That still makes it a voluntary majority vote though.
@_date: 2015-03-11 12:55:50

I don't think you understand what *democracy* really means. The word stems from the Greek δημοκρατία (dēmokratía) which means "rule of the people". In that sense, Bitcoin is **precisely** about better democracy for it allows us to create systems where the people truly governs itself.

You don't see the contradiction in your statement, do you?
Direct democracy **is** people deciding for themselves what societies (etc.) they want.




By acting the way you want to see people act in the world you **ARE** 'engineering' society into what you want it to be.
@_date: 2015-03-01 12:33:09
I don't see how family, church, baseball team concert, shriners, the amish or any communes I know have a more equitable and fair system of decision-making and government than a majority vote would be - for most of them it's in fact **a lot** more tyrannical, dogmatic and dictatorial.
Moreover, there's no *perfecting society*, there's only *optimising* it.
As for the rest of your comment I see nothing but fluffy speculation and wishful thinking. Without systems to facilitate **compromise** where necessary, any group of people, be it on the scale of a family or a continent, will devolve into conflict that then in turn leads to a rule of the strongest over the weak.

I'm not sure what you're trying to say here (in the first part) but I agree - while I see huge potential in a system like this there's also great danger in votes being public instead of anonymous. It doesn't look like they solved that problem of how to tie a vote to a single real individual to avoid election rigging and make sure every person can only vote once but at the same time keep the votes anonymous.

@_date: 2015-03-01 15:38:53
I don't see how this approach adequately scales beyond someone's backyard to something the size of the pacific ocean or the Amazon rainforest. Who's going to own that?
And considering people aren't exactly known to be very forward thinking and generally choose short term profit over long term sustainability I don't see John Smith the private guy as a trustworthy shepard of the Amazon rainforest.
Yes, bigger institutions increase (and centralise) the risk of corruption and I'm deeply pissed off at the negligence of most governments with regards to environmental protection but I don't see **at all** that full privatisation would a) even be practically/logistically feasible and even less so b) solve the problem of resource exploitation for short-term profit.

So in Bitcoin-Qt, I'd have to do a second backup after creating the 101st address, right?
And if so, does the creation of address  trigger the creation of 100 more addresses (that are then included in a wallet backup) or would a new backup after every new address    etc. be necessary?
I would assume it's the former but want to make sure I understand this correctly.

I use Armory. My paper wallet is a code that I've been told works as a seed from which address pairs are generated. That's why writing down this paper wallet code once will let me retrieve every address I ever generate with that wallet. Correct so far?
Now how many address pairs can be generated from a single Armory seed(=paper wallet)? I've seen demonstrations of the insane number of available Bitcoin addresses but surely if the number of addresses that can come from a single Armory seed would be so huge it would take **ages** for Armory to retrieve all connected addresses upon loading the paper wallet into a new Armory client - instead it goes instantly.
So basically... how many addresses can a single Armory wallet contain?

I'm sorry, what do you mean about me confusing satire and *the actual point of the Colbert report*?
I know about Jon Stewart's SOPA coverage and that's all very cool—but I doubt he'd see the benefits of a system like Bitcoin. To him technology appears like a black box for most of the time and whenever one of his guests goes into technology he's pretty much completely clueless and tries to steer the conversation back to politics and the *people and personalities* aspect of it.
Watching his show on a pretty much daily basis for a few years now I'm pretty sure he trusts people a lot more than he trusts technology so I'd be very surprised if he'd express anything but wariness and scepticism towards Bitcoin.
Then again his views (especially on things he can't fully grasp) probably often rely on his team of writers so it depends on how they perceive Bitcoin and what aspects of it they deem most noteworthy.
But of course you're right, having him talk about it wouldn't be a bad thing.

Our current economy isn't pricing in environmental costs and has no regard for sustainability. If at all, environmental destruction is only priced in with giant delays after the damage has already been done.
An RBE has the concept of sustainability at its center. So the order of operations is *"What resources and how many of each do we have on the planet? At what rate do they regenerate?"* and takes that as the basis for how many resources can be used up in a given period of time so that consumption stays **sustainable**.
How much fish can we take out of the ocean every year without **[overfishing]( etc.?
Of course this requires a global understanding of what resources exist - which is a *big data* task. Basically we need to do a huge global inventory. Open source. But with the advent of the internet and global, decentralised asset tracking systems like Bitcoin we're not at a point where this is a technological possibility.


Try **[this one]( maybe that helps clear some of the confusion. It's quite new. An RBE shares some of the philosophical goals of socialism (ensuring a good living standard for everybody) but it's a very different concept—first and foremost it's not based on central planning but instead decentralised and bases economic decisions on the **[scientific method](

Can you expand on this? Which court is going to decide on this and when?
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:31:27
Yes, people decide but ideally on the basis of scientific findings. Science is not only there to support a preconceived decision, its also there to come to new conclusions. And yes, people program algorithms but ideally they don't do it based on their whims but on rational logic and science—Bitcoin and many more open source projects are good examples of this.
I assume this system would have to be controlled by some form of a direct democracy, just like with open source software. Of course for this to be viable we need to transition into a culture (and forms of education) that bases arguments on critical thinking, logic and reason from which unfortunately we're currently still far away. Reddit is a good example of how this could work—especially subreddits like Now of course I don't have a full model on this but my guess regarding your Picasso painting would be that everyone gets access to the resources they **need** without damaging the environment or endangering our sustainability and what they do with it is pretty much their decision. So if you paint something you can do with it what you want and share or exchange it for anything you want with others (who in turn of course also can only give you things they control based on the resources they have at their personal disposal).
About your *"What will you do with those who disagree with you?"* question I thought that would only be a relevant question if you 're talking about a central gouvernment with which one could disagree. But okay, if somebody disagrees with some aspect of the system they could try to change it by making a good scientific argument and having it discussed and argued by the direct democracy. Something like **[Liquid Democracy]( is maybe similar to what could be established here.
Of course all this presupposes a culture of rational thought and argument and thus education is vital to its establishment. As long as people chop each others' heads of for their God or another this will be difficult.

I'm saying you can't just say "Yeah, well this is an isolated incident that goes against macroeconomic theory so it doesn't show anything - nobody else would act this way in a deflationary system because macroeconomics says it would be in their best rational interest to not spend any currency which is rising in value."
Macroeconomics have failed to capture the complexity of human and societal behaviour and as a result couldn't predict any of the past and current economic crises and are unsuited for accurate projections into the future.
Of course this single case here doesn't do that either but I can (only half-jokingly) say that this single incident contains a lot more empirical data than a lot of economic theory that's out there. ;)
I just ask we view current macroeconomic theory as less dogmatic, after all they're highly reductionist models.

Yeah, I too love pulling numbers out of my ass that make me sound competent.


I assume these numbers are the result of a comprehensive and representative study you've conducted? 
Come on, let's remain serious here. I agree with you that it's very likely that our monetary system will see some significant changes and disruptions in the coming decade. And I have strong belief in Bitcoin. If your systems understanding is as good as you claim you will know that in our world communication, politics and 'marketing' is oftentimes more defining for the course history is taking than rational factors like the objective superiority of one system or method over another. And Max Keiser is doing Bitcoin a huge disservice by ignoring this and not considering the implications of his irrationally exuberant appearance.
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:07:58

I agree that the ฿ doesn't look very appealing or fitting and that Ƀ is better. I also like your logo concept expect for the italicized font. Maybe I'm influenced by the **[Microsoft rebranding]( but I feel like italics in sans-serif logos have a bit of a cheesy/outdated vibe. For a futuristic and serious logo I'd try going without italics.
But talking about the Ƀ I definitely like your version better than anything I've seen so far!

There's too little detail in the coins, they look too smooth. A subtle grunge bump/displacement map or maybe even just a fitting grunge map in the reflection channel of the material would help. But I also think the coin design itself could benefit from a more detailed design.
I know minimalism is king right now but there's a difference between flat design in 2D web/print media and physical product design. Texture is a huge part in the latter, the way things *feel* and look like they feel. And in this aspect your coins are a bit plain and boring I must say.
And in general my criticism of this image revolves mainly in its use for BTCfor as a background image. Some shiny gold coins on a black desk next to a black keyboard isn't really an ideally sexy, uplifting and attractive motive.
Finally, to be honest, I'm not sure a photorealistic 3D rendering is the optimal look for something like this in the first place. I'm a 3D and VFX artist myself so this isn't easy to admit but photoreal/skeuomorphic renderings nowadays have a bit of an uncool/cheap/outdated feel to them in many cases.
Go stylized, go flat (2D design) or use at least studio lighting.
But to be honest I don't think a 'physical' coin is the best symbol for Bitcoin at all. Of course it's fun to design a coin and I imagine that's what intrigued you to do this rendering but I think it's not the best way to adequately communicate what Bitcoin is by representing it as a physical coin when that's clearly not at all what it is at its core, let alone what it can do (which is what the imagery really should convey).

Apart from coming over as... let's call it '*overly enthusiastic*' to non-libertarians I think the biggest problem is his lack of technical understanding.

But if there's no limit, then how does it not take infinitely long to retrieve those addresses I created?
Hmm... so does it only look for the addresses that are part of the already existing Blockchain and check which ones are generated by my seed?
Where does Armory (or another wallet) know what addresses to show me in my addresses list? Does it also show me addresses that I once created but have never received any Bitcoins, so wouldn't be part of the Blockchain? And if so, where does it get the information that this address has been *created* in Armory before from?

I feel they may be the most professional and reliable exchange so far. Yes, they're not as suited for quick daytrading since they currently only work with fiat transactions from user to user (that take one day to process) instead of having you put money into their account but unless you're absolutely set on doing that you should check them out. Personally I much prefer their model.

Short-term the most important challenge is to get away from our insane culture of unsustainable consumerism and debt-based lifestyles. Don't buy shit you don't need! Happiness isn't in *stuff*. And regarding the things you truly **need**, buy products **[that are built to last](

I disagree. In my opinion the double lined B looks really unappealing—like it's somehow begging traditional fiat currencies to be allowed to play with them. For people who already embrace Bitcoin it may be too close and similar to fiat currencies and the system behind them and for the establishment it may be too aggressively trying to look like "money" or "currency", both terms with substantial legal implications that may cause severe judicial problems.


Not sure if you're serious but to me this looks like a horribly cheap clipart from the 90's and definitely not like the payment system of the future.

I live in Berlin. My last ex-girlfriend is French, she lives in Paris. We used to visit each other back and forth - going from  Berlin to Paris isn't that big of a deal. If we'd wanted to move together, that wouldn't have been a problem. Most of my friends here are actually expats from other European countries.
My girlfriend now is from Russia - she lives close to the Finnish border. She's a professional **[artist/illustrator]( loves the creative and art scene in Berlin and wants to move here. *Hold on, you're from Russia? No way!*
Now simply because she's been born in a different country she's not allowed to move here. Unlike my French ex-girlfriend, she'd have to either marry a German, be employed by a German company who's willing to vouch for her (not going to happen as a freelance artist/illustrator) or earn more than 3773€/month to be allowed to move and work here.
Obviously she doesn't earn that much.
She has to struggle with horribly discriminating visa bureaucracy whenever she wants to visit Berlin and may only stay for a very limited time.
It breaks my heart. We need to do away with this crap as soon and as intelligently as possible and I so hope that we will manage to do it this century.

That's a bullshit straw man argument - I never claimed to be on the side of Ben Bernanke (and frankly don't even know who Jamie Dimon is. I'm not American, maybe that excuses me...).
You see, whatever the *'New World Order'* means to you, Max Keiser is doing a really, really poor job of exposing anything to anybody who's not already aware how fucked up our financial system is. The vast majority of people needs to be educated with extreme patience and calm. Anything that is conveyed even remotely as emotionally and crackpot-like as Max Keiser spreads his 'wisdom' is instantly rejected as ramblings of a madman.
And giving the mainstream media footage of an *'insane Bitcoin junkie who yells about how great it is to be a Bitcoin millionaire and how the entire system will crumble under his wrath'* is the biggest favour he can do them in their fight against Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:40:46
I think OP's point is that this concentration is problematic during the process of Bitcoins adoption. Maybe problematic for Bitcoin as a system but mainly for the world and society. The rising value of bitcoins give one person huge purchasing power from something (bitcoins) he acquired very easily at one point without actually contributing appropriately to society.
Your A=B scenario is only correct if those 2 million bitcoins are never spent. If however the person owning the 2 million bitcoins decides at some point to use them and buy 20% of the world's resources with them, then we should have quite a problem.

The question is, why does anybody believe resources can be (or actually are) managed intelligently by our current pricing system. The fact of the matter is that in our existing system the way price is formed is largely independent of actual resources being used or destroyed because environmental pollution and the destruction it causes isn't really factored into pricing for example.
You can read an introduction into the principles of a resource-based economy **[here]( Regarding your question, resources will be managed by applying the [scientific method]( to development and production of goods and scientifically evaluating resources based on their physical attributes, availability, regeneration rate and other factors.
An important thing to note is that the premise for all this is a shift in culture from our current model of artificial scarcity (which causes greed) to one that is to a considerable degree based on *access* rather than *ownership*, thus enabling abundance. My actual desire is not to own a car, it is to get from point A to point B quickly. My actual desire is not to own a CD, it is to be able to listen to the music on it whenever I want. Hell, my actual desire isn't even to own a drilling machine—I just want to make a hole in my wall. Until now ownership has been a prerequisite for access for pretty much everything.

Armory features a **[Secure Print]( option which prints out an encrypted paper wallet but requires you to write down the encryption code it gives you **by hand** onto a specific field on the paper wallet.

Seriously!

That premise is severely flawed though as many psychological and sociological studies will show you.

Bitcoin.de holds BTC in escrow. You wire the money to the seller and when he has it, he verifies it on bitcoin.de and you get the BTC. If he doesn't verify it he can't use the BTC either - they'll stay with bitcoin.de until it is resolved.
Currently bitcoin.de is working with Fidor Bank to implement a system which allows real time trading with this system - that means every bitcoin.de user has a full bank account with Fidor Bank that is fully integrated with the bitcoin.de trading platform.
So far I've done all my trading via bitcoin.de (with a single trade on bitstamp) and can only recommend it. When this new system is fully implemented some time early next year I fully expect bitcoin.de will be one of the best and most popular exchanges out there. EUR only though.

I live in Berlin on around 720€/month and am perfectly happy with the resources I have at my disposal, in fact I'd say I live a quite luxurious life.

It was just an example. Don't worry, a fully-fledged resource-based economy model isn't something that can be achieved in the next five to ten years, it's the project of a century if not more. ;) I'm convinced that not technology is the real challenge but culture. Technology will (and already does) make amazing things possible long before global culture will have caught up. So what we really need to focus on is working towards shifting our global culture away from war, conflict, irrational fanaticism (religion), greed and consumerism.
The Zeitgeist Movement is explicitly non-violent and everything has to be voluntarily. The point is not to force a system or some kind of tyrannical regime on the world but to try and make people realize that it's in all our own best interest to strive towards this unity, efficiency and sustainability. This is a gigantic task as it's basically a departure from most of the core beliefs and principles that guide most people's way of thinking and acting right now. We need a shift in values so that people don't define their own and each others' worth by material possessions. So that your ego isn't based on how big your house is or what rare paintings you managed to aquire for yourself somehow.
If we reach this change in the way people think about themselves and the world, I think many of the conflicts you now fear will resolve themselves. Now of course I don't have a masterplan here but for example an original Picasso would and should then be in a public museum so that anybody can access it. All the world's culture and art should be accessible freely to anybody. And a new painter wouldn't have any need to try and *sell* their work for the highest profit but instead can choose to either give it to museums or similar public spaces or give it to the person they personally think values it most. Not for material profit but because they want to. Maybe they'll exchange favours, maybe not?
I don't know but I think there's endless possibilities to be explored here. Of course that will only work once we start treating each other and our planet well and we don't need to be afraid to *miss out* because of scarcity.

About your *ease of use* argument, I have to disagree strongly. It happened to me on multiple occasions that I showed Reddit to someone and they'd feel very confused and put off by the standard design. They'd call it *chaotic*, *cheap* and *ugly* and to be honest I can't disagree with them.
Only with **[RES]( CSS sorcery like **[Aerial]( and custom subreddit stylesheets does Reddit look vaguely resemble a proper website in the year 2013.

@_date: 2013-04-03 19:38:31


Yes and yes. Absolutely. The problem is that you seem to fall into the *free choice* fallacy that is so common nowadays. Do you think you're really free right now? Do you think your completely free in your choice? No, you live in an illusion of free choice right now—being allowed to pick between 72 versions of toothpaste that companies produce with minimal cost for maximum profit. It's a knee-jerk reaction I hear especially frequently from Americans (I assume you're from the US?) to assume you'll suffer tyranny in any other system than the current one or a more extremely *free-market* one. There will be **vastly more net freedoms and choice for every individual** than we have now because managing our resources intelligently and efficiently and giving everybody free access will allow us to live in abundance. The problem is that in our system of inefficiency, global '*un*economy' and artificial scarcity we're made to believe there's not enough to go around and we'll have to live like monks if everyone gets their fair share but that is **not true**. If we harnessed the full potential of technology, both in how we allocate our resources intelligently and in how we can automate much if not most of production we could already now live amazing lives where nobody would want for anything (unless they're being really unreasonable)—all 7 billion of us.


No! I don't. Unless their enterprise endangers sustainability of resources or ecosystems, they can of course do that. The challenge is not to prevent them from doing it but to create a system where they wouldn't feel the *need* to create a wasteful automobile that's unsustainable or against the global good and instead *want* to use their genius and expertise to work towards improving the existing public transport technology. It's not about *forcing* them to, it's about convincing people that it's in their own interest if we all work together. Now when it comes the definition of *'using their own labor'* I guess we'd have to put the restraint of sustainability again. So they'd of course be allowed to work towards whatever goal they want to pursue but are not allowed to claim an inadequate amount of material resources for their enterprise. The planet's resources after all aren't really the fruit of their work but need to be managed and allocated in an intelligent system of public domain.

You're right, I guess it's just a question of whether to focus on creating an aesthetically pleasing and independent look for or whether to try and somewhat resemble established and (mostly) trusted systems to gain more appeal.
Personally I prefer a more radical approach but I can see how there are good arguments for the other side as well.
I much prefer the revised version but the merging of the t and i is a huge legibility-problem if you ask me. Also there's room for improvement in the **[overall layout]( It doesn't seem quite right and balanced to me yet.

@_date: 2013-04-15 10:40:36
Yes, it means that. Currently only Bitcoins are stored with Bitcoin.de but fiat transactions are only done directly from buyer to seller via SEPA transfer or other direct transfers. Thus at the moment every trade takes one day (more over weekends/bank holidays) to complete.
Like **[m-m-m-m]( pointed out this upcoming new approach with a partner bank will be hugely superior to both Bitcoin.de's present model and the ones used by Bitstamp, MtGox etc. where fiat funds are kept on a company account. Safety, speed and easy of access and reliability of the way fiat money is handled will be vastly better.

I use Bitcoin.de for all my Bitcoin trades using SEPA and German national transfers and it just works beautifully.

Science does. The idea is to look at all the Earth's resources (which are plentiful when used and preserved strategically and efficiently) and equally distribute them in a way that meets all human needs based on scientific results and calculations. How much do we have of anything and at what rate can we use it so we don't run out of it? What nutrients does the human body need? In what environment are people the happiest? How do people learn best? How many and which material possessions are required for a healthy, fulfilled and happy life and at which point does more property not increase those (or even decrease them)? All these things can be rationally studied.

They utterly sucked. I'm glad they're out of government (they were in a coalition with Merkel's CDU (Christian Democratic Union)) but would've preferred to keep them in parliament as opposition.
Now we're again getting what's commonly referred to as a **[Grand Coalition]( a coalition between the two big parties CDU and SPD (Social Democratic Party), which much like Democrats and Republicans in the USA basically are one fairly homogenous pile of shit. And with the completely fucked up election results this September this means we'll have 80% of parliament seats held by the government and an opposition that's only **20%**!

Maybe so but from what I've learned most Zeitgeist Movement-supporters are quite aware of the fact that the abolishment of money is not a short-term goal and that an intelligent transition is necessary. They don't reject money simply because they reject money but because of the huge problems it causes in our current system.
Bitcoin addresses some of the biggest problems with our current financial system so I do think it could be accepted as a viable option for that transition by the Zeitgeist supporters.

I know what you mean but the Bitcoins only **serve** them if they spend them, thus bringing them back into circulation. From my understanding a deflationary system like Bitcoin can only be dangerous if we establish another debt-oriented system with compound interest and all that crap with it.

I consider myself both left and *'liberal'* or libertarian (note that in Germany the political meaning of 'liberal' is closer to the US political 'libertarian' and that Die Liberalen refers to the FDP (free democratic party) which is the most pro free market party in the entire established political spectrum of Germany).

Germans are highly skeptical of the financial market - **[they even barely own any stocks]( Speculation and greed is seen as highly immoral. And I agree and respect those values. The only problem is that most are *scared* to even look at new technology in a rational manner. Things are very quickly rejected as evil witchcraft.
If this were a fantasy realm Germans would be the dwarves. Highly conservative and quite stern, wary of the fancy *magic* the foolish elven and human kingdoms like to meddle with. Skilled engineers of impressive machinery and very hard-working. They feel more comfortable in their traditional ways than to jump at every new fad that comes up among the elves and men... so easily impressionable by witchery and parlour tricks they are. But not the dwarves in their halls of stone! They will not be corrupted by easy promises. If something looks too good to be true it probably is. I fact, if something looks good at all it likely is some treachery. Oh, but the dwarves won't fall for that.
Yeah... that's how I see it anyway. ;) I'm German myself by the way. I'm a bit torn here. While personally I definitely count myself more to the *elves* who love to study and use magic and who prosper from the incredible new possibilities it provides, it is hard to argue against the fact that its conservative stance is one of the core reasons Germany nowadays in the face of the global economic crisis is still doing better than the vast majority of all countries - including the US and other wealthy western nations.

I understand your enthusiasm and it would be great to have him on board. But personally I'm not entirely comfortable with the "Let's tip everybody we want on our side!" mentality I'm seeing a lot here since this very quickly enters the realm of corruption.

I'm German and the terms *conservative*, *liberal* etc. mean quite different things here than in the US.
For example to my knowledge *liberal* refers to many Democrats in the US who aren't necessarily fiscally conservative - whereas *liberal* in Germany is most associated with the FDP (Freie Demokratische Partei = Free Democratic Party) which is currently in gouvernment in a coalition with Merkel's party. The *liberal* FDP is the most pro free market and fiscally conservative party in German parliament.
So these terms could lead to some confusion as they mean different things in different places.
Personally in US terms I'd probably identify as a *'left liberal'* or *'social liberal'* or *'left libertarian'* if such a description makes sense in US terminology?

I'm German and I find it extremely superficial. This is the kind of article I'd have expected early this year but at this point a lot more has been written that journalists could feed off of.

I wholeheartedly agree with your *No thanks.* and this **COMPUTERS WILL REIGN IN TYRANNY** crap is just some baseless FUD. I was hoping in where we have to deal with uninformed and ignorant media bullshit all the time FUD tactics were shunned.

Not stone age economies.
Resource based economy is where it's at!
IBM Executive Architect Richard Brown's thoughts on **[Bitcoin as a global asset tracking/management system]( even allude to how the Bitcoin protocol could lay the groundwork for an RBE.

I used to think just like you. I found a wallet with 200 € once and kept it and justified it with *"Well if someone is stupid/careless enough to lose a wallet with that much money in it, they don't deserve to get it back. They'll learn their lesson."* That was about ten years ago.
Since then I've changed my view on life and the world a lot and realised that acting like that makes you simply become only part of the problem. You can't complain about the world and how cruel it is and then act in a way that's no better. That doesn't make you strong and tough, it just means you've given up.




As Gandhi said so succinctly:

Don't get me wrong, the guy is a hero and I greatly appreciate what he does for Bitcoin as well as his sense of humour (the GIFs and eastereggs...). I assume he's very passionate about Bitcoin and wants it to succeed—therefore it would also be in his own and the entire Bitcoin community's interest to make trading more robust by giving everybody the best data available.
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:36:51
Sorry if this is misplaced here. I thought it would be good to let the community know so someone more savvy than me can maybe fix this. Or tell me how to fix it myself should it somehow be a problem on my end.

So how does that work in practice? Where do you keep your bitcoin client then and how does your live CD OS access your bitcoin client and offline wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-24 10:49:23


I don't like speculating—including *'bets'* like that.
I strongly doubt this feature that aired only yesterday will have had any effects on the exchange rate (yet). To those who already are invested in Bitcoin and/or have verified and funded exchange accounts it didn't really reveal anything new. And those that learned about Bitcoin for the first time haven't anywhere close to enough time to create, verify, fund and use an exchange.
@_date: 2013-03-07 17:23:45
Thanks a lot for this!
Another question: If a paper wallet basically just consists of a Bitcoin address and a private key, what exactly *is* a wallet then and what does the wallet.dat file contain?
I was under the impression that for a transaction to be completed properly it has to *arrive* and be confirmed at/by the Bitcoin client that holds the wallet.dat in question but with this paper wallet concept the transaction never really *"arrives"* at my client and wallet.dat until at some point I decide to import the private key there (most probably in order to send bitcoins elsewhere from there). Could you explain to me how this really works?

I only hope they'll get their shit together for the upcoming Bundestagswahl this September. They're already in four state parliaments and could enter the Bundestag this year but I haven't heard or seen anything resembling an election campaign from them so far this year...

Well, not so sound arrogant or condescending here but you'll have to agree that, looking at the majority of Bitcoin-related websites right now, design is not at the forefront of the Bitcoin community's priorities and qualifications right now. As of now Bitcoin is largely used by tech savvy people. Like with Linux, most of them have a stronger eye for functionality and an intelligent system than for ease of use and a mass marget-friendly aesthetic. So even if your *I think many other people also don't* point might be correct in regards to the current Bitcoin community (or the more vocal part of it), I would be skeptical about how compatible or attractive their aesthetic understanding is with the mainstream public.
You could give them texture without having them look *imperfect*.  I'm not talking about making them look dirty, just more realistic. Right now you're in the **[uncanny valley]( If you're going for photorealism (and thisbrendering obviously is going for photorealism rather than the look of a stylized illustration) you need to make it feel real.
Again I'm not saying depicting Bitcoin with a coin logo is bad per se - but all the sites and logos you talk about use a very abstract 2D illustration (or even just a circle with the B in it) to hint that. That's vastly different than emphasizing an actual, physical coin. But I understand that's not a view you'd like to agree with when your skills lie in exactly that. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:09:50
I'm German and I feel like crying whenever I see native English speakers make mistakes like that. *They're/their/there*is another popular one, or *its/it's*. *Would of* is particularly cruel though.
@_date: 2013-03-15 14:00:52
Well, you guys have to deal with some pretty harsh austerity measures because we rich northerners are doing so well and thus the Euro is so strong. If you didn't have the Euro but instead an own currency that you could deflate versus the Euro you'd probably be in a better position.
Don't get me wrong, I love the EU and absolute promote a united Europe but from a fiscal point of view the currency union currently is a huge problem as long as there are these vastly different economies and no true political union.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:37:59
Well, it's a good representation for the bitcoins traded on bitfloor (like bitcoin-24.com is for those there) but since they all trade much tinier volumes than MtGox it's not really representative of the entire market...
After all most Bitcoiners don't have a bitfloor account and/or don't trade there - so the value there is defined by the trading decisions of only a small fraction of all people trading bitcoins.
That's precisely why I propose we change our graphs into a weighted average of all exchanges.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:56:41
It absolutely is but I think they could have made sooo much more of that metaphor! Instead they basically drop it for some simple chase story that could be told without the scifi setting altogether.

True. There's a difference between doing away with national barriers and the way the EUR is implemented and working right now. I'm the biggest supporter in a united Europe and in fact a united world - but even I admit there are massive difficulties caused by the Euro in some countries.

The uncanny valley argument holds for objects as well. Of course it's the most problematic with humans (or animals) but the basic idea still stands. If you have something that's kind of photorealistic but something is *off* that will be slightly uncomfortable to people. Maybe even just subconsciously so, especially if they're not familiar eith what CGI is or how it works.
And as I stated in your original post of the rendering, I do like it as well - don't get me wrong! :) There's just different styles for different applications and not every image lends itself well to a landing page background for a Bitcoin business. In fact only very few images do.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:58:47
I understand your concern and it's a common one—a RBEM is not socialism though. It's not about uniformity. Equality yes, but it also champions individuality and creativity! I don't know why you'd want a *shittier* lightbulb but yes, you could have a unique lightbulb that Feng Shuis with your dining room set. With new production technologies like 3D printing you'll be able to have the greatest fucking Feng Shui lightbulb for your dining room. ;) The only premise and restriction would be that it doesn't take an unreasonable amount of resources that would be unsustainable and/or endanger the ecosystem. So no lightbulb made entirely out of the inner ear bones of a hundred whales I'm afraid but frankly, I don't think that's unreasonable.
@_date: 2013-03-26 06:15:05
I like them but like with all Bitcoin coin designs I've seen so far I miss the idea of a **global** currency. I'd like to see Earth on it or some similar symbol for the unification of humanity and the crumbling of these silly artificial borders. It would be a hopeful, inspiring symbol and one that is more relevant to the everyday user than overly technical aspects like the blockchain.

I just upgraded to 0.8.2 and my fee was set to 0.0005
When I hit *reset* to set everything to the default settings the transaction fee changed to 0.00000000
Why is that? Is 0.0001 really the new default or will my transactions take forever if I set it to 0.0001 now?

Are you serious? Bitcoin will only rise if normal people begin to trust in it and adopt it.
I'm not talking about *political correctness* here, I'm talking about delivering criticism of the current messed up financial system in a manner that is perceived as accurate, competent and rational - not like an apocalypse prophet screaming *the end is nigh!*
When it comes to sensitive things like this, the *way* something is communicated is at least as important as the information itself.
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:20:48


I'm sorry but that's a false dichotomy and utter bullshit - and you know it. *"You think we're crazy, that means you must be in support of the corrupt gouvernment and media."*
