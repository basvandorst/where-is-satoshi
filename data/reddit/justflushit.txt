1 hour 6 minutes to clear

This was much better. Last time I cancelled the transaction because the fee was almost 11%. The only downside right now seems to be transaction clearing.

Buys/sells not going through. High fees for transfers and transactions. Transactions taking forever to clear. Not the best 1st impression for a “digital currency” for people just waking up to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:37:17
If they can’t fix the transaction high fees and delays then this could be prolonged.

I have a CBD store a couple of blocks from my house but Bluebird beats them in price and quality by a lot. So glad they take cryptos because their CBD oil is the best. My wife’s nutritionist told us about them. 
The only criticism I would have is they don’t sell the CBD lollipops. I keep a couple of those in my briefcase for when my back pain flairs up at the office. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:11:09
I was just reordering from Bluebird and saw this in checkout. Glad someone already posted this to the group.

Gold has a buy and sell price, and also a shady as fuck guy behind the counter. Coin dealers are the worst. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:39:28
But he will sell you some gold all day long! Try taking that gold into a coffee shop.

According to my finance professor a couple of decades ago, once something has ended up on the front page of the paper it's too late. That was before the corporate scandals, internet and housing bubbles, Great Recession, quantitative easing and the upcoming great unwinding of the Feds balance sheet, and way before crypto currencies.

I think it’s actually been the sub-plot the whole time. Alchemy is the basis of the Lynx: solve a riddle and create gold (solve an algorithm, get bitcoin). The first time we see Blaise with a customer at his pot shop he’s asked, “do you take bitcoin?” when he’s in fact cash only.  The guys who paid off Captain paid him in bitcoin.  The two strangers who are obsessed with the true lodge and think the Scrolls are the basis of the bitcoin algorithm. I’m sure there’s much more to come. And the show has a major disallusion-with-capitalism feel all the way through.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:42:26
I know why they took bitcoin and offer a discount: because they want to retire early. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:49:02
Buying. Going to buy more.

I had a finance professor who said once it’s on the front page of the newspaper it’s too late. He also said 95% of people buy in at the top. 
He said this 16 years before the first bitcoin was mined, so who knows what are the new rules. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:30:43
Ending net neutrality. Imagine a company or government that wants to attack bitcoin so they throttle back internet speed for nodes. If transactions cannot clear fast and cheap then adoption as a currency will fade.

It wasn’t you, it was me. I put a SSD in my cart over at Newegg and said I wouldn’t buy with bitcoin until it went up a bit after the cancellation for the fork....

Whenever he tells me about a stock trade I always tell him how much bitcoin is up. I like how this time he cut me off at the pass. I’ve been telling him to buy some since the low $2,000s.

That’s my father in law betting NVIDA Stock goes up 39% vs Bitcoin going up 92%.

Yep. I’ll be out as soon as all these fools drive the price up to $1,000,000.

I bought a new tv on overstock near the all time high. Going to replace this week. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:03:13
I’ve been wondering if overstock converts their coin to cash or if they are long time holders. I’ve been buying a lot from them lately since they take BTC.

S02E06 should remove no doubt since there is code for a crypto currency on a whiteboard at Orbis and the character even mentions the mechanics of the blockchain.  In the early 1960s.

I bought some stuff from overstock and paid with bitcoin, and then it dropped sharply. Good for me, bad for o.co
