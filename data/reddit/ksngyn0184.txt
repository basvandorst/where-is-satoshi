A Japanese guy who earned his PhD from MIT back in the 90’s in computer science theory and economics
Programmed and coded all his life and one day came up with the idea of bitcoin and invented blockchain through mathematics after seeing the effects of the ‘08 recession. 
He worked with other Americans folks to develop blockchain and wrote his white paper. 
Now he’s probably master bating somewhere to anime porn

But fiat won’t die anytime soon desu 
You think the most powerful government on this planet is just gonna let some punk cryptocurrency render their blood money worthless?
If fiat does become trash expect to see the US gov create their own crypto that will mostly be legitimized as the national coin.
