Yes, a lot of newcomers thinking BCH price is 9K. But dont worry, bad things come to bad people. Manipulating market in this way and abusing of new comers is just hurtful for BCH on the long run. Very bad choice.

"development" control, do you know how git works?
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:51:18
Yes, indeed a one-time increase seems like a light step. However it gives control of the main chain development to b2x devs. Practically firing bitcoin core contributors and allowing miners to be the deciding factor. Decisions about bitcoin can not be made in a private meetings. Please consider my arguments.
