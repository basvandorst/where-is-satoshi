I know I can. What I have is a problem with statement saying that all rich people got rich due to luck. This is not encouraging anybody to try and make their lifes better. It simply says: don't try, you need to be lucky to win. 
People are extremely sensitive to discouragement like this. At least bloody pretend, you don't want to be the one that plants a seed of pessimism in someone, do you?

Do you know how many times they would have to be lucky in order to get rich and not go broke if all they had was a small initial investment? Odds of this are so small that you're more likely to hit lottery than be that lucky. Nice excuse though.

I'm not a rich person but I'm on my way to be. I was homeless, then got shitty factory night job, 5 years later I said enough, started pursuing my interests in IT. Now I have a good job by simply learning from YouTube. It can be done. But you miss 100% of shots you don't take.

You can say that about every single living person. They're alive cause they got lucky and weren't flushed down the toilet. You got lucky you weren't born with a dick on your head (please tell me you don't have a dick on your head) or that you didn't get killed by giant hail falling from the sky. Stop blaming things on luck or no luck, because there is always someone who would swap their lives with yours if they could. Kids are drinking water from malaria infested sources. Be grateful and do something with your life.

Tommi can save up little money for a management course or something and eventually move higher up after two years. Tommi needs to be willing to do it. Not just dream about it.
