I have to wonder if a Russian propaganda newspaper article is the most reliable source for insightful and impartial analysis on domestic American policies. I mean, I'm certainly not defending the Fed, but doesn't this seem like reading a paper published by the Heritage Foundation about how the ACA is going to bankrupt America and see its citizens dying in the streets?
In other words, is this not just confirmation bias? 
The most important aspect of creating a well-informed opinion is being heavily aware of, and heavily critical of, your sources and the biases that opens you up to. "Good information is good information no matter where it comes from" is an easy way to fall into the confirmation bias trap, because it usually just means "but I agree with what they're saying!"
That's how propaganda works. And for people who consider themselves free-thinkers and independent citizens, you (not just this subreddit, but many others) seem really willing to lap up Russian propaganda, simply because it's not an American newssource. BBC and Al-Jazeera are great alternative, international news sources. RT is not. You're critical of American newssources for essentially being 'propaganda machines', and yet... 
I don't know. Maybe no one appreciates irony anymore.

Seriously? Why don't you go read the "history" and "foundation" sections of the wiki article you linked me.

Literally the first two sentences say it is owned and funded by the Russian government. I don't know what point you were trying to make, but I don't think you were trying to agree with me. I do not think state-funded journalistic outlets have much in the way of reliability, especially when publishing news about diplomatic and political opponents. Would you trust a report on Syria produced by a news station funded by the White House?
I just don't understand how someone can dismiss US news sources simply for being from the US, and then turn around and defend Russian propaganda unironically. I'm beginning to think this isn't about information and just some weird form of political hipsterdom about avoiding the "mainstream".

Who lie about their own things. Don't pretend that 'not America = more reliable'.

I'll repeat my earlier question. *Is this not just confirmation bias*? I mean, you called out BBC for supposedly being a government mouthpiece, but you're sitting here defending RT when it literally, officially, is a government mouthpiece?

That doesn't make RT not propaganda. It seems to me you're just arguing why one type of biased bullshit has a nuttier flavor than another.
