Please stop replying to your own comments asking about downvotes. If you absolutely must complain that people don't like what you're saying, please at least just edit your comment instead of making new ones.


Depends what you mean. Just using Tor on your existing OpenBSD system is probably less secure than using a live image. That being said, I agree that OpenBSD is a better base for something like Tails. The problem is hardware support. The OpenBSD 5.6 ISO doesn't even support my laptop's Ethernet controller. I doubt there is an x86(_64) computer on earth which isn't reasonably supported by Debian.

I'm not saying there's a reddit rule against it, it's just kind of obnoxious.
As far as I can tell, using Tails doesn't look much more suspicious than Tor itself. If the dragnet knows you're using Tor, you might as well use it as securely as possible.

And electoral ballots could be rolled up and used to snort cocaine. Stop whining about everything you don't like and do your fucking job.

Which part of the world? It means "10 thousand years", to imply "live long", right? What could possibly be wrong with that?
