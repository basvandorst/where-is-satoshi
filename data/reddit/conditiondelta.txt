It's not an Alt. Bitcoin is the agreed upon code amongst the bitcoin community. Satoshi's code has been changed so are we all on an Alt?
Satoshi coded 32mb blocks. Devs fighting to go against an increase even if it is agreed upon by more than 75% of the haserate.. they'd be the ones running an alt. We can even have a X amount of coins signing a transaction in support if absolutely necessary.
Large bitcoin holders should have more say then people working to write code for us.
If the person that Satoshi handed over bitcoin development to isn't listened to then maybe all in favor should vote via their holdings.
Coinbase, with their possibly millions of coins agreed and I don't believe they've witnessed a mass exodus from their wallet.

I don't put much faith in TA when it comes to these tiny markets but I believe a clear blocksize plan would definitely help build the confidence that people need when they first enter the market. 
A lot more people are now educated on btc and will be compelled to buy when the price continues upwards.  The blocksize debate is the main road block that can curtail this. The debate continuing plus bottlenecks in confirmation will cause new people to lose faith imo.

Although I find this price to be ridiculously cheap I sold some yesterday as well. I also put up an XT Node.
I'm not a trader so it wasn't an easy decision.
If they can't see the harm they're causing by fighting over 1mb blocks and putting us at risk of not being able to handle a influx  of users than the price will probably continue to plummet and annoy a lot of VCs as well.
I hope Gavin, Hearn, Coinbase, and any other big companies out there in support of 20+MB blocks will make the switch to XT so we can drop off some Devs as we steer the ship back on the right course.

Increase the cap 20x and give the breathing room necessary for this experiment of ours to work and shine as it was conceived to. Give bitcoin a chance and watch it devour the transaction industry In all sorts of different ways. 
Holding back for new tech to reduce the load or creating a market where end-users of the tech are forced to pay up to use it at this stage doesn't make sense. Friction reduction for the end-users is absolutely paramount at this stage.

The proposal to switch to XT gave me an incentive to run a full node. And, unfortunately, an incentive to hedge my bets.
So they either understand or they get left by people like me who see a dire future if users are REQUIRED to transact offchain.

Google Inc. won’t earn any transaction fees from credit-card issuers for its coming mobile-phone payments service, unlike Apple Inc., because of evolving ground rules for the services.
Credit-card issuers hope the changes pressure Apple to trim or eliminate its fees, say industry executives, highlighting the speed at which the economics are changing in the evolving mobile-payments business.
Google disclosed its payments service, Android Pay, in late May, with wireless providers, payment networks, retailers and banks, stepping up competition with Apple Pay, which launched late last year.
Hundreds of financial institutions scrambled to work with Apple Pay, afraid of being left at a competitive disadvantage. As a result, big banks and other card issuers agreed to give Apple 0.15% of the value of each credit-card transaction. For bank debit cards, Apple collects a half-cent per purchase, according to people familiar with the service.
Google isn’t getting transaction fees from bank issuers, said people familiar with the situation. That is because Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., which operate the dominant payment networks, recently standardized their “tokenization” card-security service and made it free, preventing payments services from charging fees to issuers.
Tokenization swaps cardholder data such as account numbers with a unique set of numbers that validates a customer’s identity. Merchants never get the actual card data, eliminating one avenue for online data theft.
“There is one agreement with Visa and the banks can have confidence that there are no pass-through fees,” said Visa President Ryan McInerney in an interview. Banks and payment services can make other deals including fees, such as marketing arrangements, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Visa unveiled its new tokenization service on May 28 the same day that Google announced Android Pay and said it had signed on to Visa’s service. Others will likely follow, because of the combined influence of Visa and MasterCard.
The rules may prompt changes in Apple’s agreements with banks. Some bank executives said they are unhappy with sharing fees and may use Google’s no-fee arrangement to try to persuade Apple to alter its deals. One possible leverage point: As Apple Pay expands outside the U.S., Apple may need to negotiate terms again. The bank executives didn’t want to be identified.
“This is a bold move on behalf of the banks,” said Rick Oglesby, head of research at Double Diamond Payments Research. After agreeing to Apple’s terms for Apple Pay, “they’re now taking a stand against similar deals. It could easily turn into a standoff.”
Many of Apple’s contracts are for three years, and have roughly two years to go, according to people familiar with the situation.
Thomas Noyes, a payment industry consultant, wrote in a recent blog that he expected Apple’s deals with issuers to “sunset quickly” in the U.S. and not expand outside the country.
Apple declined to say if the new rules would affect its deals with issuers in the future.
‘This is a bold move on behalf of the banks.’
—Rick Oglesby, Double Diamond Payments Research
The new rules are a blow to Google, which had been negotiating with large banks to get the same deal as Apple, people familiar with the situation said.
Mr. Noyes wrote on Thursday that Google may be trying to convert its deals with issuers into marketing agreements where banks pay Google for the right to use its logos or agree to promote the service.
Google wants Android Pay to grow in the U.S. and globally much faster than competing mobile payments services, according to a person familiar with the service.
Longer-term, the changes may hurt Google less than it first appears. Without fees, more card issuers may join Android Pay. Standardizing the rules will help mobile-payments grow, said Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard.
Moreover, Google plans to offer coupons, rewards and loyalty programs to consumers through Android Pay in partnership with issuers and retailers. If those initiatives succeed, they could generate more revenue than a cut of transaction fees, said Richard Crone, a payments-industry consultant. He estimated that an enrolled mobile-payments user is worth more than $300 a year to companies such as Google, mostly from advertising and other marketing programs.
The rules also will affect a planned payments service from Samsung Electronics Co., which will use Visa and MasterCard’s tokenization standard, according to an executive at a leading card issuer who didn’t want to be identified.
Samsung executive Injong Rhee told analysts recently that Samsung Pay is being developed to drive sales of the company’s high-end smartphones, and not as a major revenue-making opportunity.
A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment.

I don't see how that example changes the fungibility of the underlying coins.
That would mean that that merchant chooses to accept coins from certain addresses with the "coinbase blessing" The fungibility has not changed. The coins from an external address can be sent to coinbase and be "fungible" or sent outside of coinbase for a transaction to someone who accepts btc from any address not associated with coinbase.
That's like saying gold has low fungibility because someone only accepts bars coming straight COMEX.
I agree that btc is less fungible than gold but your example doesn't make the case. It is less fungible because it has a traceable history making each satoshi unique. Gold's history can be wiped out completely when brought to a melting point.

**Bitcoin** is king and will continue to lead the way. Tech leaders, backed by large sums of money, will continue to build out it's infrastructure. The value proposition will be too strong for the public and wall street to ignore and it will rise into the $100's of Billions in "Market Cap"
**Litecoin** becomes pointless when the rapidly approaching ASICs hit the wild. It will suffer as people search for an alternative.
**Vertcoin** is going to be the biggest beneficiary to Litecoins future centralized mining problem. It will rise substantially as money and GPU mining power makes the shift.
**Dogecoin** will continue to crash as it offers no real benefit.
That's my take on the future of crypto.

Banks aren't efficient. Money is also way too important to be controlled by countries. In a global environment it doesn't make sense to have added friction when sending currency across borders as well.

"The king of New York venture edges up a bit in the Midas rankings thanks to his selectivity in the mid-2000s in early stage media companies. He turned a 2007 investment of a few million dollars in Twitter into a holding worth $1.5 billion at current prices. His firm Union Square Ventures earned 27 times its investment in Tumblr after the blogging platform was sold to Yahoo for $1.1 billion in early 2013. And its investment in online gaming company Zynga netted a valuation of 65 times invested cost at the time of the company's IPO in late 2011 (Wilson wisely sold a chunk of Zynga shares before they crashed). Wilson made no investments for close to two years until he led a $5 million round in 2013 in Coinbase, a San Francisco startup that lets people buy and sell the virtual currency Bitcoin. Other prominent portfolio companies include Foursquare, Etsy, MongoDB, Lending Club. It is currently raising two new $150 million funds, one for early stage and one for later stage deals. Wilson started in the venture business in 1985 when he was 25 years old, and rode the first dot-com boom with the sale of Geocities to Yahoo for more than $3 billion but his firm Flatiron Partners crashed with duds such as Kozmo.com. Now he's back atop the heap again."

* Your personal details cannot be abused when you were simply trying to make a small purchase at a store

* value is not seized via inflation on the whim of governments - inflation rate is known
* It's cheaper than credit cards and the funds settle much faster
* Countries and individuals are not excluded from the network due to corporate or government policies

"Bitcoin’s value as money needs to be understood like gold, which comes not from legal force, but from its specific attributes. Bitcoin’s attributes make it an amazing form of money and it was engineered for just that purpose.
It is easy to divide and recombine 
It cannot be counterfeited
It is highly durable, so long as certain precautions are taken
It can be sent anywhere, instantly, at near-zero cost
If you were going to make a super hero currency, this is one of the traits you would give it
Can’t do that with gold due to physical constraints, or dollars due to legal constraints
It is scarce, with a known supply and a known inflation schedule
And it cannot be manipulated, restricted, or seized by any central party (shares this property with gold). Nobody has special privileges. In this way, it is very democratic, and very egalitarian. 
Just as mankind has engineered houses to be used as shelter and cars to be used as transportation, so too can we engineer something to be used as an ideal medium of exchange.  But while the dollar is a poorly engineered money (so poor in fact that it relies on coercion for its value), Bitcoin is a brilliantly engineered money. 
It might not be perfect, but it’s pretty damn good, and this is why people are using it as money, despite the fact that nobody is forced to. 
And given that it is so useful as money, due to its attributes, it should not be a surprise to anyone that it commands a market price. Any good that is useful and scarce will have a price on the market. 
Economists and journalists get very caught up around the question, why does Bitcoin have value? The answer is easy: **because it’s useful and scarce**." - Erik Voorhees

Yes. Living expenses vary greatly depending on how / where you want to live. 
To give you an idea though..if you want to live in the Sukhumvit area of Bangkok you can find decent condos for anywhere between 10-17k baht. You can get food at stalls on the street for 30-50 baht.
It really depends on how you want to live. I know people who get by on less than $1k a month but I don't.
Eating out and partying get expensive but if you're looking to live / eat for cheap it's definitely possible.

@_date: 2014-02-28 15:08:49
Yes, but they should become cheaper over time if they aren't cheaper than standard wires already. Companies like bitpay will exchange bitcoin to currency for 1% or less...much less if done at scale. They offer a set rate service where you can exchange an unlimited amount of bitcoin for a set monthly subscription fee.

emerged as a computerised replication of earlier paper-based
records, is for specialised entities (usually banks) to maintain
master ledgers that act as the definitive record of each
individual’s money holdings. In turn, they hold accounts
recorded in the ledger of one central body (typically the
central bank). Those holding the ledgers have the ability to
prevent any transaction they deem to be invalid. In order
to use the system, people must trust that these centralised
ledgers will be maintained in a reliable, timely and honest
An alternative approach is to implement a fully decentralised
payment system, in which copies of the ledger are shared
between all participants, and a process is established by which users agree on changes to the ledger (that is, on which
transactions are valid). Since anybody can check any
proposed transaction against the ledger, this approach
removes the need for a central authority and thus for
participants to have confidence in the integrity of any single

With bitcoin you have options. 
* You can't print more bitcoins
* Inflation is set at a known rate
* You can control your own money(cash) yet send it instantly around the globe
* Wire transfers don't cost and arm and a leg
* You don't need to request permission to make a transfer

That's not how it works. When you set up an account with Amazon to sell stuff you do not also have to set up a means to process credit cards. Amazon processes transactions and then sends the sellers money. Money flows through Amazon.
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:20:32

@_date: 2014-07-03 14:43:08
Here's what I got from it:
what do we want from money?
-medium of exchange, store of value
Trust is needed
Money has value only because someone else believes it has value
Whatever replaces cash needs trust
Fiat gives extra trust because it's backed by the state
State has the power to tax.
This won't necessarily change when fiat no longer exists
Can we trust that bitcoin has value tomorrow?
We can't trust every currency out there(referring to alts). Multiple currencies won't work
Is disruption a micro story or a macro story?
Rise of plastic is a micro story. Effects transmission from a central bank point of view but didn't disrupt the levers
Kenyans using their phones don't effect the macro story - still can be controlled by Central Banks
If they're not changing the transmission mechanism it's not a macro story
Scotland a good place to experiment with new currencies..bitcoin

An increase in value allows for real user adoption. Chicken and egg. An increase in price, increases bitcoin's utility. If the price is higher more value can flow through it seamlessly. It can then function as a conduit to transmit funds and a SoV to well..store funds.
When the number of speculators increases it brings the spread in exchanges down. This allows bitcoin to function as a tool for remittance and global transfers. Price matters, speculators bring utility to bitcoin that otherwise could not exist.

As with everything that is assigned a value. The con is that we've been held hostage by governments issuing money. Money whos supply can change at any given time.
If money is simply a way to measure value then its supply should be as strict as a gram is to measure weight or a ruler is to measure distance. The market will be able to better calculate their decisions when buying, selling, or saving. It needs to be standardized and accessible.
Better choices will be made and humanity will benefit from those choices.
Edit: for shitty 3am intoxicated grammar and a centimeter would probably be better than saying ruler.

Exactly. The USD Hegemony system is on it's last legs and is rapidly heading towards it's breaking point.
The U.S has 2 options. Allow the new system to be gold centric which drives it's value through the roof and gives a big boost to China, Russia, and the EU or steer it towards a digital ledger system where global settlements happen over bitcoin instead of via physical gold.
The USD settlement mechanism is damn near dead. The world needs to utilize gold settlement or bitcoin for cross border trade. Bitcoin doesn't provide a big boost to other nations like their gold holdings skyrocketing will.

BS. Talk to the victims in Cyprus or the Millions of others who have had their funds confiscated


Open to argument. Merchants generally charge 3% on top here for CC purchases. Other locations the cost is baked into the price. Merchants are beginning to offer discounts for using bitcoin as it is cheaper / faster / safer for them to accept it.

Start working that out after we're at 20mb. 20mb isn't a ridiculously high amount. 1mb simply won't cut it when we scale.
20mb also gives room to grow. Large companies and big investors see that and should begin to take part in building out the infrastructure.
1mb is a hurdle that must be overcome, soon. 
If a sudden event happens or a "aha moment" occurs that spikes usage, btc won't operate as it should with the current blocksize. 20mb gives space, an auto-scaling version would be better but I'm all for putting the best written solution in place as soon as possible.

"The Abra smartphone App combines on phone storage of digital cash with person to person cash transfers. Abra uses **Bitcoin** as the reserve currency.  The consumer never has to see **Bitcoin** nor understand what **Bitcoin** is, they just see USD, MXP, EUR, etc. Consumers and digital currency exchangers, called Abra Tellers, all use the same Abra app. Senders and recipients of funds can use the Abra App to find Abra Tellers from whom they can exchange paper USD for digital USD - in person.
Think of Abra as Uber for money: We will turn every smartphone in the world into an ATM machine to process digital currency buys and sales for paper cash.
Our app facilitates the discovery of Abra Teller on the ground, provides buyer/seller ratings on Abra Tellers and helps Abra Tellers manage liquidity so that they don't have to hold onto digital currency if they don't want to."
Bill Barhydt **FOUNDER** Jul 16, 2014
I like this article. Our model addresses these two issues (compliance and liquidity) in a very elegant way:
1. compliance - private key is stored on the phone. All transaction settle on the block chain **(buy bitcoin, send bitcoin and sell bitcoin.)** That means that traditional MT regulation (which is effectively man in the middle regulation) doesn't apply in this instance. We're simply brokering the introduction between transaction parties.
2. liquidity - we don't use banks to provide liquidity and settlement ala traditional remittance companies. Consumers and FX agents physically store **bitcoin** on their phones and FX agents decide on their own what type of cash in/out service they're willing to provide directly with the consumer.

I believe the term will help people understand money thus realizing bitcoins importance.
Here's a blast from the past (Before BTC)
"Very nice! As the only "value" which is to be found in our currency exists entirely within an elaborate accounting system of "who owes how many numbers to whom", the physical dollar we may carry in our wallets is truly nothing more than a portable and transferable piece of the official ledgers; one that has been duly certified to stand alone as one of those ledger numbers with the proper pedigree to pass as currency. Numbers that remain in ledger form may only be added or removed through official banking channels, such as we see in the example of the check clearing house of the Federal Reserve. This has been Aristotle's attempt recently to explore with others why his simple act of typing "$17" does not create 17 spendable dollars; because it does not have the proper pedigree of origination within the banking system. Specifically, it was not borrowed into existence by the Treasury from the Federal Reserve, or even perhaps borrowed by you or me from our own Main Street bank.
Fancy designs with presidents on paper is an assurance that these "ledgers to go" so to speak do bear the proper pedigree as numbers acceptable for legal tender. When they exist in ledger form, they demonstrate this proper pedigree by the integrity of the database that tracks their movement. Nothing more, nothing less."

So money is pretty much a bidding tool that the market uses to assign value to things. It changes from hand to hand and doesn't insert itself into assets. It's a supply of money that moves around telling the market what something is worth. Take real estate for example in 2016 U.S house real estate was valued at $29.6 Trillion. You do not need to have $29.6 Trillion dollars printed for real estate to be worth that. Every house isn't going to swap ownership at the same exact time.

That is what it was created for..
"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone"

"The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) used to have a different name: Al Qaeda in Iraq. After 2010 the group rebranded and refocused its efforts on Syria.
There are essentially three wars being waged in Syria: one between the government and the rebels, another between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and yet another between America and Russia. It is this third, neo-Cold War battle that made U.S. foreign policy makers decide to take the risk of arming Islamist rebels in Syria, because Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, is a key Russian ally. Rather embarrassingly, many of these Syrian rebels have now turned out to be ISIS thugs, who are openly brandishing American-made M16 Assault rifles."

China is currently playing the paper game until it blows up worldwide. 
They are the world's manufacturing base, the largest producer of gold..and umm..bitcoin.
China will be fine. They've planned and allowed for this by helping the U.S kick the can down the road by purchasing debt and producing their goods in return for explosive growth and real production.
Don't mind the paper matrix that sits on top of the worlds goods and trade. See past it and look where the actual production is taking place.

   Demand will be high...so let's let them all use our scarce resources for free 
We're paying for growth with inflation. Miners provide these resources and receive block rewards. Nodes provide these resources because it is in their best interest to do so. If it is not in your best interest then don't run a node!
I am by no means as technically genius as Nick but bitcoin is built for people to use. No need to add road blocks when it is difficult enough showing people the benefits of bitcoin. If it doesn't settle or it's too expensive, it's not better. It's a cool nerd project with no use-cases.

The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

Why make people fight over space in a 1mb block? We're trying to get this thing off the ground here. Making new users and use-cases fight over 1mb is insane.
Bitcoin won't become an international means of settlement if it doesn't gain traction..and at 1mb the only use could be international settlement because other use-cases are destroyed. 
We got this cool little thing that the world is talking about and now taking seriously. The space is being artificially limited so the world will create a better thing to replace it if the size doesn't grow to allow for more activity of various kinds.

A hardfork becomes progressively more difficult as the network grows. It's difficult now, think about pulling off a hardfork during a period of rapid adoption.
Another huge problem with waiting is that mass adoption simply cannot happen if people cannot get their transactions into blocks. Bitcoin loses it's appeal if you have to bid up the transactions cost for settlement to take place.
Yet another problem is that the 1mb cap does not allow for the segregation of funds in the backend of exchanges. A large pool of compiled funds will ensure that exchanges are always a risk. If funds are separated when trades occur another "gox" event can't take place.
Security is severely limited as small transactions are not feasible. Compiling funds to ensure that transactions are cost efficient decreases security.

Rare earths are a big deal but something has to be used for international settlement. The $ is (was?) the primary means of settlement. That's all falling apart.

"Trend 7: Impact of Accelerating Speeds on Traffic Growth
Fixed Speeds
Broadband speed is a crucial enabler of IP traffic. Broadband speed improvements result in increased consumption and use of high-bandwidth content and applications. The global average broadband speed continues to grow and will more than double from 2014 to 2019, from 20.3 Mbps to 42.5 Mbps. Table 4 shows the projected broadband speeds from 2014 to 2019. Several factors influence the fixed broadband speed forecast, including the deployment and adoption of fiber to the home (FTTH), high-speed DSL, and cable broadband adoption, as well as overall broadband penetration. Among the countries covered by this study, Japan, South Korea, and Sweden lead in terms of broadband speed largely due to their wide deployment of FTTH."

Increases 20x or even 8x gives us some room to get out of the gates and proceed to build solutions that compete with the big boys. There is simply no hope with 1mb and to kneecap bitcoin at this level in the name of decentralization is ridiculous. 
It pains me inside everytime I sell bitcoin as it should be devouring the transaction market but when I need to free up cash and weigh the odds between btc and gold I have to sell bitcoin. It's a shame as I expected digital property to be able to scale with simple changes to the code.

A big price increase will lead to (eventual) lower volatility. Bigger traders can step in and play both sides with a deeper order book. $500,000 - $1,000,000 trades shouldn't have a significant impact on the price but for now they do.

I'll still hold onto *enough* but I now think unstoppable bitcoin will be replaced by something that comes along that is coded and treated as Satoshi's whitepaper meant bitcoin to be.
Let's have a lightning network that doesn't even have the blockspace to settle any transactions..tell me how that is better than what we have already? Bitcoin is an international means of SETTLEMENT a word that has been lost upon the world of credit / debt based trades. Lightning doesn't settle shit until it is sent over the blockchain..so it needs to scale and it needs to scale now.
BUt people don't understand the difference between a transaction and settlement. That is why the global economy is fucked..no settlement. Bitcoin can potentially solve that problem but not with the current set of devs knee-capping the fuck out of it.

"Since it would take an entire book to detail all the ways Warren Buffett is involved in America’s economy, both on the private side, but also the government side, one can sum up his direct connection over the past five years by saying; He owned the banks that created and sold worthless assets to the world’s investors. He owned the ratings agency that charged huge fees to lie about the value of those worthless assets. He owned the banks that bet against huge odds on those same worthless assets. He owned the media company that made sure the American people never found out the truth. He owned…invested in, rather, the man who would decide the fate of each of his investments, US Senator Barack Obama. He created the government bailout plan that would save his soon-to-be worthless investments. He profited by the billions on the implementation of his global banking bailout idea. With the US economy collapsed, he advised the President to pump trillions of dollars into the US economy through massive stimulus programs, profiting companies he owned. From destruction to rebuilding, Warren Buffett has helped guide the events like no other man alive, and profited like no other as well."

Exactly. Bitcoin is beginning to provide a use-case that will be impossible to ignore. Especially when competition picks up and profit margins are driven down.
Let's just say for simplicity sake that 100 million people work overseas and send a percentage home to their families. They may be able to take 40% of their earnings in BTC from their employer or buy bitcoin locally..the former can come later.
Either way..on payday they can send their bitcoin to someone like BTCPoint and then send their family a pin # and withdraw local cash quickly.
This destroys Western Unions business model and should save anywhere between 1 and 10% or so which is a huge, huge deal.
Great work, BTCPoint. Let's replicate this everywhere and not only provide an un-ignorable use-case but allow these people who travel abroad to help their families save money. Knock on effect helps "developing countries" prosper to a greater extent.

If bitcoin is slower than me going to a store to convert gold into fiat to make a payment then it's not much better than gold.
If bitcoin is slower and more expensive than a bank wire then it's not much better than fiat.
If transaction space is severely restricted; people are better off using a combination of gold and fiat to store wealth and make payments. Bitcoin's strong selling points are crippled.

Then I understood bitcoin and it blew my mind. All of the properties of gold that I loved but with the additional benefit that people, anywhere in the fucking world, could not only prove their holdimgs, but send it nearly instantly, anywhere.
The store of wealth aspect is a complete game changer as is the currency ( at least online) aspect..but it also offer so much more that cuts out the parasites in so many industries.

Not to turn this post into a price prediction thread but I expect Q2 and Q3 to become a massive maybe we should buy a little just in case half a year.

At this point I don't care who accepts it and who doesn't. Microsoft, Rakuten, Dell, etc. Who cares..it's awesome but any other "I'll accept that too" company doesn't really matter.
We need progress on killing Western Union.
We need large funds to say "Hey, this may be a big deal, I'll invest X"
We need it to be cheaper for the average Westerner (It's probably already cheaper for Africans / Some Asians to send money overseas) to be able to travel / live abroad and send money from home to where they are for less than wires / ATM withdrawals. (It's getting close but I don't think it's there yet at least for me)
It will be accepted by Amazon and Apple once it has an undeniable use-case. Accepting won't boost their profits much at the moment but once it spreads it will save them money.
If a stamp of approval from these two companies drives the price up I think I'll be more sad then happy. We will help them make more money, not the other way around. Fuck credit card fees..even the biggest boys in the room understand that.

1. Businesses care and will begin offering discounts when competition for bitcoin customers increases in their industry
2. in 2013 the global remittance market was $542 Billion. People do send money to "3rd world" countries
3. BS. Own a business and then talk. It's another incentive for businesses to offer discounts over CC's.
4.  Not really. Do people like being restricted within their borders. May not matter to those holding a NOrth American or European passport but the majority of the world is severely restricted because of where they are born. Technology is tearing apart the reason for governments to exist.
6. A current rate of inflation which is known and transparent. Not Based on what some people feel it should be or are forced to implement.
7. You can trust that it will work as it is made to work. Making a legal purchase won't be blocked because a company feels that your IP is based in a place where people commit fraud or a purchase MAY be risky. Can't even tell you how many times I've had to call my bank while booking the same exact flight, from the same location, to the same location..because they felt it was risky. A "risky purchase attempted and blocked over 10 times. Yup, payment organizations are brilliant.
8. Depends. "Illegal" is defined within borders, not global.

Transactions don't get blocked, the blockchain doesn't operate on bankers hours, your identity can't be stolen while making a purchase, You don't have to pay 5-10% to send money home if you're working abroad, un-banked can travel with large sums without worrying about being robbed of their cash.

1.) 
Real estate on the blockchain is limited
2.) It increases the amount of stakeholders thus giving incentives for people operating on the blockchain to see that it is secure / valuable.
3.) If the tech is going to be useful it needs to be large and robust enough (i.e extremely costly) to attack it. This means value must increase for usability to increase. A lot of things simply can't happen in a proper way if the value doesn't increase.
So there may be a million great ideas out there but they won't come to fruition until bitcoin grows. Once it grows and functionality is increased people will see that it is here to stay and find the use-case of wealth storage / transfer much more appealing.
Small chicken and egg problem but at the rate VC's are tossing their money into the ring I don't see the infrastructure growth / use-case growth / usability aspect decreasing therefore we can expect a secure and extremely useful network to evolve into an appealing place for people to park / transfer wealth.

This is coming from SWIFT Business Forum - New York 2015 that took place on March 3rd.


The practice of correspondent banking still at the heart of most cross border payments. However, every day we read announcements in the press about new entrants, start-ups and crypto-protocols challenging correspondent banking. The payments industry is closely watching these developments, as many commentators believe that "the wire" is no longer fit for purpose to meet today requirements for real-time, low-cost, transparent transactions - in particular for low value person-to-person but also to some extent for corporate payments. With the continued de-risking, closing of nostro relationships and more examples of global direct-to-ACH payments, some even declared that "correspondent banking is dead". Hear from this panel of experts who will help you understand the latest forces that could be disruptive to the global corresponding banking business - and, if that model is considered no longer future-proof, what the new model could look like.

It looks like it was also discussed on the 5th in Copenhagen


Bitcoin was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, as a distributed mechanism for value exchange. During the past 2 years, this technology has been hitting the headlines, for good and bad reasons, and has become an accepted unit of monetary transfer for many goods and services. Whether you believe in Bitcoin as a store of value or not, there is a huge potential for disruption within the Financial Services industry enabled by the underlying technology the Block Chain.
Join us for an interactive debate, to learn what Bitcoin is all about, where we are on the bitcoin journey, and to take a look at what the underlying technology could enable in the very near future.

"Bitcoin is challenging traditional thinking and the underlying blockchain technology could be set to be more disruptive still. Overall, the change brought by technology disruption promises to be significant, so do today’s established financial services firms still have time to fight back? Do they have the right culture, the right talent, the right mind-set? What can they learn from the challengers? This session will explore if and how ‘traditional’ wholesale financial services can be transformed by harnessing disruptive technology and who will be the likely winners and losers."

I said that a couple of years ago.. Currently kicking myself. 
Now I own BTC and the above mentioned.
Although I think there are motives behind your post I'll bite. I look at gold as my long term wealth storage. Currency and stocks(potentially) are pretty shitty for that. I don't want counterparty risk when I'm thinking about my "wealth". 
BTC's are kind of a mid-term savings / spending vehicle. The potential is absolutely enormous so it may allow me to accumulate more "wealth" if it plays out like I expect it to. The potential is about as disruptive as it gets as it has the ability to completely bend over the current financial industry as we see it today. It also crosses borders with ease, and very quickly. Much easier than bringing PM's with you.
Nothing is a safe asset, and you must store your earnings somewhere. Study up and make the decision. Nobody can do it for you.
I think currency works for local spending, BTC for international transfers / internet, Gold for storage.

Negative. We're in "Beta mode". Early adopters are testing the currency at this point. Right now it is transitioning from miners / testers to people who see potential. Slightly bigger money is starting to enter the area which causes volatility. Hopefully, with this, very early adopters / miners will shed some of their coins expanding the currency bloc. 
We don't want slow growth..slow growth means peanuts are entering the arena. We want rapid adoption which will allow bigger pools of money to enter and bigger purchases to be made.

From Mike Hearn
"I'm excited by this work for a couple of reasons.
One is that I strongly believe that Bitcoin's short to medium term future lies in finding an advanced "killer app" rather than trying to compete head on with VISA or MasterCard. Whilst Bitcoin has many advantages over credit card payments, for most people the barriers to entry are high enough to keep them on their existing payment solutions. If we create a new market or application that is highly compelling and requires Bitcoin, then we give people a stronger incentive to acquire some. And once they've made the decision to get some coins for that killer app, why not get a little bit more than needed and also use it to buy other things later? To make a killer app we need things Bitcoin can do that other systems can't. Micropayments is an obvious example.
The second reason this work is important is that our community hasn't been making good use of the contracts features Satoshi left for us. Despite that many designs were documented years ago (by me on the Contracts page), there haven't really been any apps that use them. "Where are the contract apps?" is a question that came up a lot when I was in California for the conference. The cause seems to be that it's hard to understand how to turn the high level descriptions on the wiki into working code. The micropayment channels code in bitcoinj now gives us a worked example from beginning to end - you can read the theory, read the protocol description and then see it how to translate it into a real, working system that manages all the fiddly details. Now we have an complete demonstration of how to turn a contract design into reality, I hope we've cut a road through the jungle that others can follow.
If you're interested in building a contract app, please do consider building on bitcoinj and feel free to ask us any questions on the mailing list. We're happy to help."

Bitcoin can be used for many things. it may become ideal to store some wealth in it. I believe transferring wealth is where it can shine though.

* This shows bitcoin is more secure as an "offshore" asset than anything else
* People are also becoming aware that even if some gov entity steals your coins that as long as you have the private key you can take them back by sending them away from their "control"

But as said - bitcoin is divisible so it is able to rise in value as high as necessary to accommodate the flow of good / services / value transfer required of it. It can do this with whatever amount of coins are in existence.

Said it before and I'll say it again..the price must increase dramatically if it is going to function as a currency. If you want the bitcoin economy to be more than pizza and VPN service it must rise to a price that will accommodate it's use as such.  at this price the amount of people that can hold coins is severely limited.

* They cannot handle a rapid influx of volume
* They fail miserably under DDoS attacks
* It's a site based on trading cards
I'm glad their around but bitcoin needs to move past MtGox or MtGox needs a huge upgrade / re-branding effort if it's going to lead the market. They got us to where we are but more is required if we're going to reach the heights that I think we can.

People seem to be spooked at the low dividends lately and the low hashrate.
Friedcat has been withholding funds to pay for Gen2. He's also talked about franchising out his hardware. I'm under the impression he's selling it off for more than he'd get mining with it once Gen2 rolls out so I'm still holding. Been a rough ride lately but the market is either irrational or Gen2 won't be rolling out anytime soon.
I wouldn't tell someone holding BTC to buy (it may turn out great) but I would definitely sell ActiveMining for AM imo

Is it a worthy investment? Who knows. Does it have the potential to be one..yes, hell yes. I'd say the potential for an enormous return is greater in bitcoin than anything else at this current time. I'm super bullish on gold, but as far as potential goes I have to give it to bitcoin.
The technology is as disruptive as it gets. It's disrupting the ***financial industry***. This means that it's rate of adoption directly adds to your investments bottom line. 
If a web company has a million users it doesn't really mean shit unless it can be monetized, with bitcoin, the instrument itself increases in value with it's use and adoption. There's a little over 11 Million bitcoins..a miniscule amount.
I send money at least once a month from the U.S to another country. I get absolutely killed with fees and have to wait days for the transfer to take place. Bitcoin cuts way down on the fees and time spent waititng. This is a huge market in and of itself. 
The bitcoin network can also be used for a variety of other things. Notary, contracts, escrow, the uses will keep coming.
Billions of people don't have bank accounts, can't use paypal, but they do have a cell phone. Bitcoin can be used as their means of sending money to one another.
Plenty of other reasons but I'll leave it at that.

Worst case is the company disappears along with your coins. Best case is probably a 4x increase in the pps and a increasing dividend. I guess there's a chance that it could go higher if people are willing to buy in with a much lower yield but we would probably need more transparency from the company along with an additional sustainable income stream added

My sentence implies that currencies carry risk. They may get wiped out due to hyper-inflation, confiscated directly from your bank account via theft, or steadily de-valued by it;s issuer.

"Enter Coinsetter, a high-performance, U.S.-based leveraged trading platform for Bitcoin that raised $500K this past April from Tribeca Venture Partners and SecondMarket founder and CEO Barry Silbert. Based in New York City’s Fueled Collective, this startup is working to become Wall Street’s professional connection to Bitcoin; its objective is nothing short of legitimizing the Bitcoin industry in the process.
“Right now people can buy and sell Bitcoins but there isn’t a platform out there that gives people the comfort to actively trade millions of dollars on it,” said company CEO and founder Jaron Lukasiewicz. “Coinsetter is entering the market as a platform that brings the reliability needed to sustain high-volume, high-performance trading.”

My thoughts exactly. I despise a lot of paper products as they dampen the demand for physical but I believe this will have the reverse effect. The more publicity, the better.

I believe your angle is flawed. If you purchase a security, wait a week for a dividend, and sell it at your purchase price then you did better than break even in 1 week, not 48 weeks.
Various other scenarios work as well. Yours is only true if the security drops to 0 after purchase and you slowly re-coup your investment via dividends.

BTC is a "physical" market. Gold is a paper market. Gold will have it's day as the go to wealth reserve for large sums when the paper market breaks. BTC will have it's day as a borderless means of transacting / moving moving money cheaply and efficiently. Both go much higher.

Companies that they invest in turn into Billion dollar companies. Do you think they're going to sit on their hands, throw some money in,  and just wait and see what becomes of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:09:17
No..not at all like the .com bubble in the 90's.
You can objectively value stocks. Bitcoin doesn't have earnings, a P/E, a level of growth it needs to meet per quarter, you do not collect rent from a bitcoin.
Supply cannot  be ramped up to meet demand. The supply level time/rate is known. People cannot IPO more bitcoins, there are no hotels to turn into condos, you cannot grow bitcoins in your garden.
The price is going up because more people want a limited quantity of bitcoins. Stability is laughable at this stage. Stability means it is not spreading.

The monetary base is the "hard currency" in the system. It is the "MONEY". The banking credits that people use day to day are merely a layer that sits on top of the base that is meant to be fungible with base currency. If I own $1 and the base is $1Trillion my physical dollar is 1 / 1 trillionth of the money supply. If the base triples, my holding is cut by 2/3rds. Because a mass-exodus from bank credit to physical currency (base money) hasn't occurred does not mean the FED increasing the monetary base is a meaningless statistic..it is the reference point to all credit in the banking system.

The market cap is too small for it to operate as a stable currency on a large scale. "Speculators" must drive up the price to a level that will allow it to function on a wider scale.
it would be awfully hard to find the bitcoins available to make purchases if use expands and price stabilizes anywhere near this level. $700mil doesn't stretch very far on a global level.

With stocks money is already waiting for news, a rally, or an event to jump in. Funds, money managers, ETF's, etc already have access to the security as well.
Bitcoin is different. There is a delay in getting into the exchanges, getting approved on coinbase. etc. People are also just becoming aware of bitcoin and those who knew about it are becoming more comfortable with it.

I get that. He said xx amount of months to break even..it was a false statement. if you purchase a $10 stock with a $1 yearly yield it does not take you 10 years to break even.

No idea. Waiting to see if the infrastructure can handle the inflow of capital. I'm super bullish but the infrastructure is still weak. If a company like coinbase would allow people to purchase thousands of bitcoin at a time then I'd be inclined to say "this is it!" but we still rely on Gox and to a lesser extent Bitstamp. You can never really know what's going to happen.
I do think we're going higher, much higher, and these numbers could possibly be a distant memory in the near future but...Gox gives me slight reservations. I'd wager we're not under $200 for very much longer though.

You either cause a panic or you run the price up over $1000 fighting with mainstreet for coins.  I'm not saying it did happen but this is a hypothetical scenario and would be a good way to accumulate a large position without sending the price into the thousands

if I change banks it could probably be cheaper. There's a U.S branch bank out here where I believe the fees would be lower. It's something I'll be looking into. Bitcoin possible but not as easy as it should be just yet. 
Gold complicates things..better for storing wealth in a specific location than it is at transporting it around the world unless the quantity makes it worth while. i.e big players..not me. You have to deal with customs as well. 
I'd eventually like to see services that offer gold -&gt; bitcoin -&gt; gold international transfers. Great way for large money to move wealth imo but that's a bit off topic.

Syrian attack could quite possibly drive the price of gold down (momentarily). The "war" is all about the $USD supremacy which needs oil / nat gas to flow down a pipeline thought Syria and onwards to Europe. It's an effort to block non $USD gas flowing through the country.
If that happens the USD as the world's reserve currency takes a hit and gold may end up as the means of international settlement between countries.
The global financial construct is at risk in Syria. "Interesting" times ahead..and I don't say that in a good way. It's about to get ugly

There are very few bitcoins in existence. People want bitcoins now more than ever. The price goes up as a result.
The amount of money in bitcoins right now is absolutely miniscule. If it was easier to purchase bitcoins the price movement would be much more dramatic imo. Sure, things may calm down, but I wouldn't be surprised if the pace picks up from here either. The flow of money towards bitcoins is in it's infancy.

Paypal's market cap is derived from it's earnings. Bitcoin's will be from it's usefulness at storing and transacting.    The potential is much higher. I'm not saying this to pump, it may never reach that level, but the potential is definitely there
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:28:26
Exactly..no. Not at all. Fiat is constantly inflated causing money to always be chasing a yield. 
Bitcoins give you more control. The BTC Network doesn't tell you who you can send money to, you don't need to wait for a transfer that has been delayed over the weekend, it doesn't report to the IRS if you send over $10k(which is fuck all these days).
it's going to act more as a hybrid between a savings vehicle (fiat is not..even though some people mistakenly think it is) and a transactional currency. It really shines when it's used to cross borders.

A bubble is when an asset or "asset"'s value far surpases it's value. with bitcoin it's true value cannot be gauged at this time. If bitcoin can function as a conduit to move billions globally at near 0% fees a $1000 per coin is nothing. If it can bank the unbanked and allow them to transfer value home to their families or to each other via mobile, $1000 is nothing. If it fails at all this and remains a very niche currency the current price may very well be too much with the "hoops" people have to jump through and fees to be paid to acquire coins. I don't see it failing though and I see great potential in micro-payments, contracts, possible asset trading within the blockchain, and ecommerce.
Bubbles form when and asset can be produced to exceed demand. Hotels turned into condos, houses bought for $400k but renting for $1200 a month, tulips can be grown, etc, etc.
bitcoin is only a bubble is it's utility deteriorates as capital flows in..I think bitcoins utility has barely come to light and it's potential has barely been tapped.

@_date: 2013-08-31 15:03:36
With coinbase you can link your bank account and purchase immediately. You do not need $ sitting on the exchange to purchase. Downside is that you're limited to 50 a day (or per 24hrs) and you can't bid for a specific price.
It also appears that coinbase buys/sells on bitstamp so if bitstamp goes tits up coinbase will probably at least temporarily have issues.

I'm not sure. I think it has to do with their bank. Back in March/April is was brutally difficult to buy any bitcoin due to restrictions. You would need to hit refresh a million times and hope some were available. That was then increased if I'm not mistaken and it is much easier now.  You would need to contact them for further info.

Make your own decisions.

You normally receive a margin call and your broker will sell off the asset or other assets to cover costs incurred.
A very simple explanation. if you buy 1 btc at $100 it needs to go to 0 to lose everything..a 100% loss.
If you lever up 5x with this brokerage and btc drops 20% you lose 100%.
