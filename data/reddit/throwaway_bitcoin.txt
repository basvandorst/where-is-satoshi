bitcoin-cli sends change back to a non-segwit address: not fully supported.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:27:01
You can send to segwit address, but any change is sent back to a non-segwit address: Not fully supported.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:41:53
You have been posting about this for 20 days.  The Bitcoin Core client does not have a UI for segwit, and the console does not fully support segwit.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:49:32
Like bitcoin-qt?  The reference implementation of Bitcoin that does not let end users use segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:52:33
That is Santa's change :)

bitcoin-qt. 50 copy/paste.

Instructions in the post: 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:51:40
How do I move away from the laggard bitcoin-qt (bitcoin core) wallet to something modern that supports segwit today?  
I have all of the blockchain data using bitcoin-qt and do not want to download it again, how can I migrate it to Electrum or Armory? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:28:51
That's the change.

redditgifts - my secret santa is getting one in addition to a "normal" gift.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:07:01
Please provide an estimate as to the current recommended fee. 
 Best I can see, recommended fees are 700 - 900 satoshis / byte.  
  
  
Someone I gave the gift to swept their keys with 500 satoshis / byte ($17 fee) and the transaction is unconfirmed for 12 hours.

LOL, Sophie was the only duplicated name so wanted to keep them separate.  There are double Bobs, but one is a couples gift.  Also, James is written upside down, but he's a chill guy.

It was closer to $25 when I funded, damn price increases!  :) 
And it was 52 transfers - 50 cards and 2 others.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:01:32
Kind of, but it's only bad if you use it for evil.  If people don't want the bitcoin AND they don't move it or use it or have the card, I can buy them out after 6 - 12 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:24:52
Read the instructions.  Breadwallet and Mycellium (and others) have ways to import/sweep paper wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:07:39
I was being all generous and bitcoin preachy, now I have to tell people to not do anything with the bitcoin as the fees will rape them.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:49:52
bitcoin-qt.  50 copy/paste. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:05:34


End users... the kind of people who will not use a debug console in bitcoin-qt. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:17
I am almost done - will show the final product.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:18:10
Yes, I have a copy of the public, private keys and person's name... but not for personal reasons.  I will remind them in 6 - 12 months if the coins don't move or re-print if they lost it (some are kids).  
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:02:39
I have a copy of the private keys for just this reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:28:12
Tell me about it.  I made 50 paper wallets with 0.01 bitcoin each to give away, people are losing 10 - 30% of the bitcoin in fees when import/sweeping into a mobile wallet.  
I have had to tell people to not bother moving the bitcoin as the fees are too high.  
The [final product]( the [funding transaction]( and [close-ups](  
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:48:06
I used [this layout]( but generated my own keys from a different site, wrote my own instructions and taped them onto thicker christmas card-stock.  And as a backup, keep a copy of the address, private key and person you gave it to.

Cheaper to mass send - 1787 bytes for 50 addresses ($45).  
Versus 220 bytes * 50 = 11000 bytes for 50 individual addresses ($280).  
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:26:51
Awesome, can you share the funding transaction?
