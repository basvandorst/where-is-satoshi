Does anyone know  the date of the expected court ruling?  I think its sometime this month.

Agree.  I wouldn't be surprised at a 3.5k low.  But saying that sort of thing scares the crap out of people.  If it does go that low, it will only be briefly. But if you're hodling, who gives a rat's furry behind anyway!  I say, Let It Drop!  Let's get this over with and make some money!  This prolonging of the bottom is only making crypto look absolutely awful in the press!

Final close -1,032.89...like another 179 points in 10 minutes.  Wonder what the morning will bring!  Scary stuff.

That's because newbie buyers don't do research.  They also have very SHORT memories and have no ability to see how one news story relates to the next.  All of this crackdown in Asia and elsewhere can be directly attributed to the volatility, massive price spikes, anonymous buying, and market manipulation caused by Tether.  The good news is that BitFin has been caught, and the market is correcting to pre-tether gains. Unfortunately, it could happen again if the Crypto Community does not stand up and say "STOP!"

Respectfully, I believe the EXACT opposite.  It's currently struggling at every boundary because it wants to freaking DROP!  Let it!  Get it over with!  Then we can soar straight up, although I agree it will likely be more slow-and-steady this time.

That is the most depressing thought of all.   Please, The-Physicist.  Say it ain't so!  lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:03:20
Good Grief!  Another week WASTED!  All of this sideways BS. The market obviously does NOT want to rally yet.  Let it freaking drop to -5k so that we can start the freaking recovery!  
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:42:11
IMHO, It MIGHT eventually break out to 9-10k, but the resistance is just too severe to go much farther. That would also mean the next plunge may be a bit lower than the last, maybe 4.5k, some even say 3.5k  Had it plunged to the second tier support level all at once instead of stopping at stupid 6k, we might be soaring by now!  :(

Nikkei 225 just opened....down 3 percent
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:53:05
10 minutes to go....DOW currently -854....if anyone cares.  :)
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:20:52
OMG!  Yes!  Please!  Let's test the 8500 Resistance Level for the 12th time this weekend!  Good Grief~~~~

I really wish everyone wondering about BTC price would realize one simple fact.  Since well before the $20k surge in December, the market has been propped up by Tether.  Like it or not, now that the Feds and everyone else have caught on, Tether will no longer be "printing" 1 million Tethers every single day.  Crash to 5000 is imminent, and it will stay there until something PERMANENT is done about Tether and BitFinex.  Meanwhile, general population's trust in Crypto will take a very LONG time to recover.  If you want to be mad at someone, be mad at BitFinex and it's Tether ponzi scheme.

Wish they would save their energy for after the crash.  We're gonna need them.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:38:35
Well, they will still be hodling after it drops to -5k.  But if it drops NOW, they will probably get their money back a heck of a lot faster!  Again, this is just my opinion.  I feel the need to RANT!  :)

I know..interesting stuff but LONG overdue correction.  Poor Donny Trump.  This must be killing him.  lol
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:39:40
It's not flat  It's been banging its head against the 9k wall for several days now  THAT should tell you something  ;}

Putin doesn't have to pay Trump anything.  Putin's got the goods on Trump BIGLY! But it does make for a happy coincidence.  :)  
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:28:32
Okay, which one of you chuckleheads keeps buying Bitcoin!  Give it a rest already!  Let 'er drop!  Let 'er drop! Then we can soar to the sky like a bat out of hell!  :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:36:25
Again, respectfully, I think it is this prolonged dropping-interrupted-by-days-of-stagnation that is eroding investor and public confidence.  It it were to just CRASH and begin recovering, people would forget about it within 30-days or less.  This agonizingly slow crawl to the bottom is killing crypto with each and every daily news story posted online by the hundreds!! 
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:28:16
Not really my point, but I get you
