drama queen.
@_date: 2014-04-25 08:05:36
Exactly. It's about the perception here, not about the stocks can't be split vs. Bitcoins can. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:37:55
hear hear
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:40:50
Can you be a bit more specific in your question?
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:49:22
Peaked? Dude, 1 Bitcoin has 0.00000001 Satoshis. Until 1 Satoshi reaches $ parity, it can't peak. That's like saying that 1 tone of Gold is too expensive. That's why we measure it in grams, ounces, etc. Read more before you spread bogus.
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:10:49
too cute for crime, huh?
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:41:12
Yes. 1.000.000.000 USD/coin. So we all deal in Satoshis.
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:25:48
Nice! Even though it's far from what I'd call "beatiful wallet app".
@_date: 2014-05-02 09:57:52

@_date: 2014-03-19 17:14:40
Satoshi might be a bit too drastic. I'm still a fan of the mBTC (or name it whatever you want) scale.
@_date: 2014-09-04 14:17:43
Did you try pock.io? I love their website, but ... seems to good to be true.
@_date: 2014-03-25 10:52:37
Strange. I've used Kraken quite often recently for withdrawing to my bank account with SEPA and worked smoothly. As other people said, the delay is from Kraken, not from the SEPA protocol.
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:51:44
Any Bitcoin conference or meetup in the area should have a photographer payed in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:58:57
I see no Bitcoin payment option...
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:07:35
Yeah, in my situation, I got a few days of delay also, exactly when I needed the BTC, but it was my silly mistake.

I agree that it's rude. Thanks for the idea on how to turn this around.
@_date: 2014-01-17 14:18:46
While I agree that it needs to be easier, I disagree that it's hard. Noth Bitstamp.com and Kraken.com are farily fast at buying Bitcoin. Then there's localbitcoins.com. Some people...
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:58:13
"made" is not the right word here. You made an investment that turned out positive for a while, but it got sour when you wanted to cash out. Welcome to the Bitcoin rollercoaster. It's a bumpy ride, especially for short them expectations. 
Heck, all my Bitcoins might be worth close to 0 tomorrow, but that's the name of the game. 
Heads up and wait to see how this story ends. Could take a few good months.
Also, don't trust what people say. That's the beauty of Bitcoin. It's all open. You can learn and check everything.
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:16:18
Since you mined them, you can check where they went. Try to follow the addresses on the blockchain.

@_date: 2014-02-23 17:22:09
You must be kidding. Do a little search around here. MtGox is no longer an exchange, they moved location, the CEO has no idea how to handle a PR dissaster and you can not get fiat or Bitcoin out of there. Look in other places.

I'm curious on how that works also.
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:08:14
I keep asking myself the same thing. If one exchange is down, why do the rest get affected. The only reason why I can think of is arbitrage bots/people leveling everything.

@_date: 2014-02-25 08:55:45
Yup. They can't print Bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-05-02 15:19:32
Look at the volume. Some big players are selling, which is good. Or one of the closed exchanges released the funds, which is also good. Or we're sinking fast...which is also good :D

I see Bootstrap, I see Apache, I smell some PHP:  but that's all standard and doesn't give any hint about reliability and scalability. Actually, this makes it feel amateurish again. I don't know who the team behind this is, but no RoR or Python for any serious endeavour doesn't sound fit.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:16:34
Seems so. It wouldn't hurt them really to play by some rules. I'm all for breaking the system hu-ha, but there are diplomatic ways of winning this game and some of them imply following some rules.

I think there's a good reason why MtGox has this verification system. It's not MtGox being malicious or paranoid, but banks require more solid proof when big amounts of cash flow trough their accounts. Money laundering preventions and such.

Being a developer, I'd be curious to know more info about their backend and how scalable that is. Also, they should put a god damned captcha here and here, flooding is fairly trivial now. Maybe even whitelisting verified accounts. 
Aside from this, I'm sure there are other logic/financial tricks that can be applied. Maybe a minimum exchange value?

I've been holding on some bitcoins for almost 2 months. The prices have grown much more than I initially hoped or anticipated. While free money is damn sexy, I realize that not all things come for free, so I started spending some of my Bitcoins, to keep the economy flowing. Sure, the iphone case I bought last week might turn out to have costed me a few K next year, but I'm ok with that. Some things come, some things go.

Why would you want that boring fiat when you can buy stuff for Bitcoins? 1 car = 1 Bitcoin, 1 house = 1 Bitcoin and so on. This question has been asked quite a lot, imagine when 1 Bitcoin was $0.10. Where did the liquidity come from? Magic!
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:17:56

@_date: 2013-10-07 06:51:39
seems fake to me.
@_date: 2013-11-15 12:08:45
Gotta love the tech aspects of the Bitcoin revolution. Not only the price hu-ha.
@_date: 2013-07-03 11:13:33
I find this fascinating
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:05:27
Might be a bit of both.
@_date: 2013-07-16 09:24:54
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:05:06
typo. It was meant to be "or" instead of "of", but the "bankasaurus" made me giggle.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:20:53
You're right. It's not 1 buyer.
@_date: 2013-04-26 11:12:20
You're right. I also had the same feeling towards the end of the report where they were bashing the old system. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:04:36
"so new pupils can join in" what kind of logic is that? Pupils can join in even if the price is $1000...

@_date: 2013-11-20 09:12:38

@_date: 2013-12-03 12:07:35
Said the man who has cash in an exchange which he doesn't know how to withdraw, instead of buying something from Gyft or all the other shops online. What's the point of money of you're going to be sitting on it?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:36:34
Let us know how this goes :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:02:12
That depends. Usually not the exchange itself, but someone else on the exchange willing to sell you the BTC for 1K $.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:56:08

@_date: 2013-04-29 09:50:32

I would love to see some pics.
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:41:58

Gyft/Amazon Coupons for Europe, not only US.
@_date: 2013-10-10 06:32:19
I never understood this pending part. If they don't have liquidity, why don't they just get it from Mt. Gox or Bitstamp.
Sure, at a higher price, but hey, no waiting.
Alternatively, that waiting is just to get the right price, so no reason to complain.
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:53:29
And by "not miss it" you mean...?
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:43:21
I see those too, but I'm not clear on what the purpose of this is.
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:44:52
Seems scammy
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:04:11
What's the tech stack you're running on? How scalable is it? I just signed up and your exchange (like many others), doesn't even have a captcha. A script kiddie could flood your registration form... 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:11:22
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:14:04
spot on. Especially about the ponzi scheme. If I start a hugely succesful company now, am I part of a ponzi scheme because I'm an early adopter and I convince other people to use my product? And other people convince other people? Then I'm sorry for making a good product, good PR and marketing. Also, all my early investors are not in here for a ponzi scheme.

Maybe, maybe not. Time will tell. Did you hear about the "no trading fees" part over at MtGox this weekend? Sounds like it will go even higher, IMHO.

bitcoin-24 is also trustworthy.

Exactly! I'm "working" on a small experiment now related to this topic and I'll share my results on this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:38:36
That doesn't apply if you want to purchase now. Have you ever tried purchasing with Bitcoin to see the advantages?

That is the problem, most of the times.

"China’s central bank warned on Thursday that financial institutions should not trade the digital currency bitcoin, saying that while it does not yet pose a threat to China’s financial system, it carries risks.
The central bank also said in a statement on its website that it will act to prevent money laundering risks from bitcoin, a prominent digital currency that is not backed by a government or central bank.
It said however that ordinary individuals were free to use bitcoin, so long as they took on the risk themselves." Reuters.

@_date: 2013-10-15 07:22:58
Man, as much as I appreciate the idea, this is so typical for most of the Bitcoin related companies: they don't know how to sell. The website is a mess, sending mixed singnals to the buyer. I'm not suprised if the Customer Support is bad or non-existent. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 09:24:30
Let's stop talking about the price and focus on merchant adoption.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:38:41
Quite the opposite. Trustworthy small companies are well represented in social media, with good customer support on twitter, posting offers on Facebook and so forth.

The story is partially fishy. You will be in debt again, my friend, if you don't get your shit together. Bitcoin saved you once, but if you're here for such cases, heck, Litecoin jumped 12x this month. Hopefully you will come back to support the Bitcoin economy later.

Yeah, people get too stuck on these numbers. People, remember, bitcoins can go way below 1.0 or 0.1 or 0.01.

Does your spidey-sense tell you that 200$ is the max value Bitcoins will ever reach? Do you expect someone to say "it's too late" or "still super early" ? Read a few pages of stuff here on Reddit and you'll know how to answer this on your own.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:32:44

Okkkkk. Now I'm satisfied. :) All the best to you guys!
@_date: 2013-04-30 10:54:20
You really can't know what will happen. What if it goes down to 1$? Personally, I'm holding on most of them, but I also bought quite some stuff, just in case. Also, if you want to use something like bitspend for quick purchases, the price is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:36:16
So the number of transactions is now much higher?
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:18:30

Let's say a book costs 14$. You buy 14$ worth of BTC, you send them to BitSpend, you receive the book. Basically, you spend 14$. Now, if you risk a bit and way a few days, you might buy that book for the equivalent of a few $ less, but not much. Plus, you get used to spend Bitcoins, which is important otherwise the Bitcoins you hold on to might be worthless anyway.
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:23:17
Who ever tests them send proof of transaction and opinions about the service.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:30:48
Maybe price rise, because it's no some evil plot against Bitcoin. Just a bit of ignorance or misunderstanding.

@_date: 2013-04-10 08:35:21
I don't get this: why would people buy less with Bitcoins? If anyone who supports the economy whats to buy something from Amazon (for example), they can use the few services that allow them to trasnfer fiat to BTC and they pay with the new BTC. At least in Germany, with SOFORT payment ant bitcoin-24 it's fairly fast. (or was, a few weeks ago).

This is just 1 small factor out of many others. Anyhow, the difficulty also rises the more miners come in the picture.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:07:02
it's meant to be spent. Go buy something with your 10$ today and enjoy it. Tomorrow it may be worth 10 cents.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:51:13
Taking a break and stagnating for a week or a couple of weeks would be awesome. Taking the focus from the price of Bitcoin to it's uses it's very needed right now.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:16:59
The big rollers can't all need money for Xmas presents, right?
@_date: 2013-04-19 12:13:42
this might give you more insight: 
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:41:45
Oh shit. You got verified. Bad news for you, bro. Get unverified, ASAP!
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:20:26
There's something about this guy I like. His slick attitudine and pro-anarchy ideals seem strong enough to take on the big sharks.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:09:33
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:46:31
You have my upvote, but not my respect.
@_date: 2013-05-10 11:55:31
730 Bitcoins sold? So?
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:36:30
Oh, that's nice! Testing now.
[EDIT] Just bought using this flow. Super smooth. 
[EDIT 2] Nope. Target just cancelled my order. No idea why.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:20:48
More details are welcomed :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:13:52
Sounds very smart. High price postings attract the wrong kind of attention.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:37:55
@_date: 2013-04-30 11:47:46
I don't see how Cryptocurrencies can solve the job creation problem, even if Bitcoin would make the financial system more lean.
@_date: 2013-09-17 08:38:48
I call bullshit.
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:44:30
bitcoin-24 seems quite ok. No approval needed.
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:52:35
good question. One problem can be that it has low liquidity, but it has the best interface.
@_date: 2013-05-04 20:50:56
Hopefully they will come out from behind the curtain of witty comments when they go public.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:29:59
Can you please explain where you got this from?
@_date: 2013-07-02 15:41:59
When can I really buy from one of these babies?
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:31:51
In the next 30 seconds.
@_date: 2013-10-20 11:59:09
Banks, per say, are not evil. Again, take a look back at early history. People running the banks as corporations and politics are evil. Also, 0 transparency. I think Bitcoin can change all these problems.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:39:13
Strange. I've never seen a drop with such low volume. Smells like little oscilations.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:36:44
didn't you say the same thing when it was 1$, 10$, 100$ and 200$ ?
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:10:04

sweet jesus, this is cool!
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:20:47
fun, right?
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:04:58
why not gyft.com and buy the phone from Amazon.com?
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:40:15
Very likely, just like in the stock market. BUT, they can't just let the bots battle it out, otherwise things would get out of control.
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:15:33
Can be any type of broken code on the server side. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:03:29
super credible source, don't you think? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:59:30
shhh, yes he did, he did, honey! It will be ok.
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:22:29
what charts are you reading and what pills are you on?
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:28:34
Kraken.com is missing also.
@_date: 2013-07-02 16:03:09
Same here. It's ok. Nobody falls for them this time.
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:27:40
did anybody try them?
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:04:19
The time to give Mt Gox credit has come. Well done, guys! This time around you seem to be pulling trough. 
Bitstamp and Coinbase, come on guys! You can do it!
What about the other smller ones, like Kraken? I don't hear the Kraken roar lound and often enough. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:56:46
Do you guys purchase from amazon.de also?
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:57:29
Let's see how much is SR really contributing to the Bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:58:01
Is there some open source code for this? I'd love to get my hands on something like that.
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:37:13
What are you selling?
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:42:19
Go sit in a corner and shut up.
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:49:25
Gimme some gold and I'll show that I can launder it too .
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:35:56
Oh, if the writer says "Trust me" he must be legit.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:31:42
Well, some milestones are justified. E.g. 100 USD, 1 bn market cap. Those seem ok to celebrate, but we should have some other, more solid stats, i.e. XXXX merchants accept bitcoins, merchant Y processed XXXX about of Bitcoins last month (like bitpay did) and so forth.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:24:00
Yes, because pastebin.com has been proven to be the best source of news known to mankind.
@_date: 2013-04-15 07:56:12
how are you planning on reaching such a value? Are you doing something about it? Have you contacted possible merchants?
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:31:36
Can you afford to lose those 5K? Then go for it and buy a ticker on this rollercoaster.
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:59:13
Of course my purchases won't make a difference. Heck, if I sell all my BTC right now, it will still not make a difference. But take it as a symbol that not everybody is behaving the same way.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:36:15
Arbitrage keeps the exchanges in sync.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:18:58
you have made a bet. You lost. What do you do now? You cash out peanuts or you buckle up for the comeback?
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:20:43
People like you are still around? damn.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:45:06
don't you have anything better to spend your time on? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:26:39
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:22:57
9flats, you just earned yourself a advantage over airbnb.
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:13:29
hmm, that is pretty brilliant.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:48:39
Exactly. Even in China's case, the concern is not directly related to Bitcoin, but mostly to money laundering and other similar crimes. 
Some of the implications could be that, when the adoption grows, they might require people to ID themselves for the transactions between these financial institutions and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:43:03
I may be a dick, sir, but I don't share shady news. I'm an fair dick.
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:50:14
ah, right. It's BS. Don't spam, dude.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:16:27
YES! Somebody gets it. You sir, made my day.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:33:38
ok. I'll give you guys a shot tonight. Let's see how that turns out. Hopefully well :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:23:27
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:05:48
I'm not sure what you mean...
@_date: 2013-05-07 12:42:37
I noticed that they have one too. Why aren't people using that?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:41:01
No. It's the about a guy investing what he can afford to lose and with decent a plan B.
@_date: 2013-05-10 12:20:56
That's a nice idea: big fees. Almost anything is better than just destroying the Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-17 11:44:50
Why are you late? Strange perspective. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:18:17
Shocking to who? :) This is Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2013-04-22 08:09:06
bought it! awesome. Now go unlock PathFinder :)
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:51:50
Too late for what? Is buying Apple/Google/Ford stock or gold too late? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:45:52
Long bank withdrawls time. That is 100% ok and called arbitrage, but not everyone can do it.
@_date: 2013-07-02 16:58:45
Why is everyone scared of regulations? I think they are an acknowledgement of value.
@_date: 2013-04-24 23:18:54
Same here. Plus I received 8 emails about un-authorized login attempts. Somebody is obviously trying something.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:50:51
@_date: 2013-05-14 09:00:19
But he has a friend who has one! zomfg.
@_date: 2013-04-29 10:06:03
I don't see an option to withdraw or add BTC, so it's only trading for profit.
@_date: 2013-04-20 09:54:59
what Monday crash?
@_date: 2013-10-14 14:49:53
So. Did you recently buy/trade Bitcoins? Why?
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:10:05
You lucky yanks. :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:50:16
I'd love to, but I'll be honest. Your website is super minimalistic and I don't know anybody who used you guys before.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:23:07
Hear hear. No news about price is relevant or helpful. We should apply the 1st 2 rules of Fight Club
1st RULE: You do not talk about Bitcoin Price.
2nd RULE: You DO NOT talk about Bitcoin Price.
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:01:16
US only, right? I wish Gyft was for Europe too :(
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:51:06
whaaat? :)) half-truths everywhere
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:45:38
When the aligment is perfect.
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:16:49
As mentioned in my edit, this didn't work :( Bummer. I need a new method.
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:17:27
This is very true, but not related to Bitcoin only. These rules should be applied to any online shopping website. What is specific to Bitcoin, especially in these early stages, is that you can track down who makes the website. If they don't reveal any names, investors or previous businesses, stay away. Also, real companies have a decent social media presence too. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:49:30
Holly Molly, I love your UI.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:24:03
Yeah, go for Kraken. It's the fastest.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:14:52
solid plan. Can I "steal" it? :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:48:11
Let's forget about the price for a moment. Can you seriously compare Bitcoins with Tulips? This is useful technology vs. decorative plants.
