There are so many things wrong and missing from this point of view, it’s scary. You need to learn more, and understand how the world works before you make such claims. Otherwise, you’re just wasting your breath.

Btw I didn’t put 1 for each point. They were numbered in order lol. Reddit changed it.
And my first comment, is a perfect example of a concise judgmental statement.

Oh I’ll make sure to be careful. Let’s dig into your half assed essay.
1. India didn’t ban anything. 
2. China didn’t ban anything but major access to crypto markets and ICO’s. Bitcoin can still be purchased. And it was probably a good thing. In fact, China has created government programs to mine bitcoin. 
3. South Korea didn’t ban anything, they embraced it by scaling down anonymity. 
4. You can’t have a decentralized monetary system like bitcoin take over until the other, more powerful forms of financial influence, i.e. the USD, take a backseat, and that could take years. But Japan’s got the right idea. 
5. You don’t explain how fundamentals are affecting things, not FUD, so please be more specific.
6. Major banks and plenty of foreign governments are adopting it, and those who don’t will be left in the dust. 
7. “It can get better or worse...” Astute observation Steven.
8. The worth of bitcoin is already proven to be more than $0. I’d suggest reading more and watching the markets.
9. Finally, do you really think rulers and those in power still get quizzes? Come on man. They make the tests.
That better?
