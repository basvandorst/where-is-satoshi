If only.  The problem is that the government loves doing these things *so* much.
I think a big reason why people don't understand why bitcoin doesn't need to be regulated is because the concept of non-manmade regulation didn't really exist before bitcoin.

I've noticed that Uber/Lyft drivers are always really interested.  I think it's because having a stretch of time where you either have an awkward silence or a discussion encourages the types of conversations that normally wouldn't happen between strangers.

Agreed, it would have been more accurate to say that the banks are using principles bitcoin popularized in an attempt to appear to be keeping up with the competition.  That's not to say that they actually *are* keeping up with bitcoin, but some of their processes may improve as a result of this effort.

I thought the whole point of the soft fork was so the new transactions *will* be relayed.  The segregated witness just looks like a "anyone can spend" output to an old node, so it appears valid.  Unless I'm mistaken.

I don't understand why everyone thinks nodes running old software are important.  It seems to me that if they don't upgrade, they're only hurting themselves, and that if they're economically important, they'll upgrade.  
@_date: 2016-03-28 22:53:40
I completely agree. There's no inherent conflict between the different cryptocurrencies. Each project absorbs different people and embraces different niches in the market. Bitcoin can't do everything by itself, and shouldn't try. Bitcoin's purpose is as the anchor of value for the whole crypto economy. Rapid experimentation should be done using the altcoins, not bitcoin. Once certain features are proven to work on an altcoin, bitcoin can adopt them. 
Altcoins increase bitcoin's value over the long term.

@_date: 2016-01-30 16:05:36
Loving this line of questions. The only reason there's the threat of a hard fork is because Core appears nonchalant about increasing the block size, which the masses view as necessary. So there needs to be communication from core as to either 1) why a block size increase is *definitely* unnecessary, or 2) when and how a block size increase will be deployed. These guys are super smart, and I trust their decisions, but they need to be able to back up those decisions with data; otherwise bitcoin is not a viable organization.

This subreddit was under some pretty heavy brigading. Don't forget [this]( exists.

This is an awkward article whose premise is somewhat of a non sequitur.  The answer to this question is "no", unless the blockchain is a public blockchain, such as bitcoin.  The reason using bitcoin would help is because no one would be able to hack the core infrastructure.  They'd still be able to hack a bank holding a giant heap of cash, though.

Well said!! I highly doubt that any of the core devs is doing anything other than what they believe to be the best for bitcoin, and they haven't steered us wrong yet, after all these years.
What's frustrating is the censorship happening on Bitcoin's strength derives from its open nature - that is, anyone with an internet connection can participate in and contribute to bitcoin with an equal voice given to everyone.  Censorship is toxic to this openness and thus toxic to bitcoin, as it gives a select few individuals who control the media an outsized voice in the debate, not unlike those who control the media in global politics.  Bitcoin is fundamentally superior to these legacy systems precisely because there *is* no censorship because *all* of the information pertaining to it is public.  Thus, bitcoin will overcome the legacy systems in the long run because we have the truth on our side.  Censorship is fear of the truth.  If we start fearing the truth, we all lose.

I don't understand.  Which wallet are you talking about?  How is it advisable to allow users to sign *messages* with an address's private key, but not transactions?

No, it's really not. As you can see, no one pool owns more than 21% of the hash power as of now: 


What I just said.  It's game theory, really.  No miner would attack the network, as that would destroy bitcoin, along with the attacker's wealth.  Any powerful miner's optimal strategy is simply to keep mining and claiming the block rewards.

A hard fork only affects bitcoin users *during the fork*.  A fork is unsustainable in the long term, as miners would eventually coalesce around one or the other.  Just make sure you wait until the fork is over before settling any transactions, as any coins you receive could be double spent.
That being said, people tend to panic sell when there's a service disruption like this, so yeah, don't put your whole life savings into bitcoin. The price will recover eventually.

Ohh, I think I see what you're saying.  Basically, there are hosted wallets that allow you to sign messages from addresses you "own", but you don't really control the funds in those addresses because you don't actually have the private key.  So it's dumb that these services allow you to do that.

I am skeptical of this claim. Altcoins are not "bad". Bitcoin is arguably much better off because of all the altcoins, especially dogecoin, which was a proving ground for tipping, crowdfunding, smaller standard units (bits), and taking ourselves less seriously.

If Fred and Joe are sharing a wallet, doesn't that mean that *both* of them are in control of 9 BTC (in both addresses) at the beginning of your scenario and the 5 BTC in 1addrA at the end of your scenario?  In that case, doesn't that mean that Joe (and Fred) can always sign messages from both addresses?  Which means that they can both prove control over 5 BTC of funds?  Which is true?

The crypto market, being completely open, unregulated, and tamper-evident, is thus perfectly efficient. Bitcoin's decentralization is enforced by this perfectly efficient market mechanism. That is, bitcoin's value is inversely proportional to its degree of centralization. So it really *can't* become centralized, but if it does, there will always be another cryptocurrency that is less so.

Two separate branches cannot prevail for long, as it's extremely unprofitable for miners to mine the losing chain.  If one chain gets 51% of the hash power, a miner's optimal strategy is to immediately switch to mining that chain.

I have a full node on DigitalOcean and it's $80/month.  I'm probably going to turn it off soon. My bitcoin computer was $400.  It'll be more cost-effective than the DO instance after 5 months, even if I weren't planning to do all the tutorials and become a bitcoin hacker :)

What are you talking about? Masters is a Trojan Horse *for* cryptocurrency. Bitcoin can only succeed insofar as it's valuable, and one of the main reasons it's valuable is privacy. As soon as bitcoin's privacy is proven to be fundamentally flawed, and as soon as some other currency is proven to fix said flaw, everyone will simply migrate to the new, private currency. You can't corral people into using a free market currency where every transaction is monitored, if there exist other free market currencies where no transactions are monitored.

Wow, great documentary, except for the lady who kept pointing out bitcoin's flaws. Yes, bitcoin will have a wealth disparity, at least at first, because it *rewards its early adopters*. It would not be adopted otherwise. Bitcoin will continue to be in an "early adopter" phase until it achieves dominance over fiat money, which could take generations if it ever happens. Bitcoin is designed to reward everyone who invests in this phase. This is not a bug, this is a feature. 
Also, the same lady mentions that bitcoin is inferior to fiat money because fiat money gets invested, while bitcoin "just sits there". This completely misses the point that bitcoin allows you to invest *in anything you want, with no intermediary*. Yes, if you want to let your bitcoins sit and collect dust because they're a great investment (which they will continue to be throughout the early adopter phase), you can do so. Or, if you're unsatisfied with the returns on that investment, you can use it to invest in other crypto-ventures which may have a faster return on investment. By contrast, in the fiat world (at least in the US), you *can't* invest in private startups because **it's illegal to invest in private companies unless you're an accredited investor (meaning very wealthy)**. You *have* to put your money in a bank, let them "invest" it on your behalf, then accept the pennies they throw you in return, instead of the huge returns they get by investing in successful startups. 
Once bitcoin's early adopter phase is over, holding bitcoin won't be such a good investment. It'll still be better than giving it to a bank, but there's no reason to expect that people will just let their coins collect dust when there are promising crypto-ventures everywhere. I'm sick of people criticizing bitcoin's flaws as though they are permanent. It's a startup currency, something that has never existed. Of course it has attributes *right now* which prevent it from performing a few of the functions fiat money has now, but wait until everyone is using it. Have the slightest bit of imagination, geez.

First of all, that would be a stupid thing for the government to do, and although the government has done stupid things in the past, in general, there needs to be a public outcry against something in order for the government to get away with banning something so clearly beneficial.  I think that's a pretty big "if" in Dimon's assertion.
Second, two things would happen. 1) Law-abiding businesses would simply move to freer countries without completely moronic governments, and 2) Illegal businesses would continue on as before.

I don't know the precise history of gold, and there may be a way to research this to find out, but I imagine gold has always been valuable because it's shiny.  Shiny things are desirable because men can give them to their wives to accent their beauty, proving the man is powerful.  Gold as a currency just seems like a natural consequence of these conditions, since it also has the additional attributes of scarcity and durability. So I don't think there were ever people that didn't value gold; at least an amount of it useful for jewelry.  You wouldn't trade *all* of your food and weapons for a shiny rock, but you might trade some of them, just like most people would with fiat currency today.
The Continental and the Antoninianus were failures because they were intentionally devalued by their issuers, not because they weren't widely adopted.  Bitcoin, of course, does not have issuers, and thus cannot be devalued.

@_date: 2015-11-06 21:00:09
Well sure, brick-and-mortar businesses will have to stop openly accepting bitcoin if it's banned, but Internet businesses won't, especially once OpenBazaar gets off the ground. But bitcoin is money.  Once enough people are holding it and using it, it will be useless to ban it... that'd be like trying to ban cash.  Sure, you can punish large, visible businesses for openly accepting some form of money, but you can't ban everyone from using it. If something is valuable, people will find a way to get it.
Large companies moving abroad or not would depend on the popularity of bitcoin.  Once enough people are using it, yes, you want to go where the money is.  If a government restricts or bans something that is valuable, you go somewhere else.  Look at Venezuela.  Their capital controls are strangling their economy, and the only thing keeping it alive is the black market.  Banning bitcoin would be a form of capital control.  It never works.

This is actually a common misconception.  Banks simply create the new money for a loan *out of nothing*.  See [this statement]( from the Bank of England.
This is materially different from loaning out money that has already been deposited.
@_date: 2016-07-21 08:14:16
I don't buy the argument that people who *know* they're going to lose would fight anyway.  The people that fight "against all odds" are the people who still think they have a chance of winning, if they just believe hard enough.

@_date: 2016-07-21 08:10:46
There's a couple of different layers of "fractional reserve banking".  There's the layer you refer to, which is simply lending out money on deposit.  Then there's creating money out of nothing, where the bank lends out more money than was deposited in it.  Bitcoin prevents the second kind of FRB.  
It also discourages the first kind since it can't be created out of nothing, so there can't be deposit insurance by a central entity that can bail out a bank that makes bad bets in the marketplace with newly created money.  If there's a run on a bitcoin bank, that bank is simply insolvent, and almost everyone loses their deposits.
@_date: 2016-07-10 18:45:50


I'm curious, what prediction that I made are you referring to?
@_date: 2016-07-25 05:34:50
The more information there is, the more accurate the prediction.  You can bet there would be secondary markets to provide this information.
I guess what's more likely to eradicate war is simply forcing governments to go to the people to fund the war, by taking away their ability to print money.  I'll bet wars would be much less likely in such a world.
