XBT Provider has strict rules for our business operation. These rules are decided by the board and followed up on by our risk manager and Nasdaq’s Issuer due diligence. We are required to hedge all liabilities to ETN holders by buying and holding bitcoins. Right now, XBT Provider owns 4386.53 BTC (2015-06-02 11.39 CET) and we follow our policy for safe keeping bitcoins as disclosed below. We are discussing a safe way to prove our assets as we wish to be as transparent as possible. As can be deducted from the policy below we keep a small amount of coins on exchanges, some coins on a hot multi-signature wallet and all remaining coins in multi-signature cold wallets.
**Policy for safe keeping of bitcoin assets of XBT Provider**
In order to safe keep bitcoin assets, the board of XBT Provider have decided on a secure multi-layer process for handling and safekeeping bitcoins. 
In order to hedge exposure to the returns of bitcoin, XBT Provider will hold bitcoins. A small part of the holdings can be kept on bitcoin exchanges, if deemed necessary additional coins can be held on a multi-signature hot wallet and all holdings over a threshold must be kept in safe storage according to the limit and methods disclosed below. All changes to this policy must be approved by the board.
-Assets kept on individual bitcoin exchanges cannot be in excess of 1000 btc.
-The total of assets kept on exchanges cannot exceed 4500 btc
-The total of assets kept on exchanges and internal multi-signature hot-wallets cannot exceed 6000 btc or 10% of assets, whichever is largest. All remaining assets must be kept in safe storage.
-At least 90 percent of bitcoin assets (except if assets are very small as defined above)) must be kept in safe storage.
**Safe Storage**
At the latest when the these limits are reached XBT Provider will send bitcoin holdings to its safe Bitcoin address using P2SH (Pay to script hash) transactions. This way the company can send funds easily to a safe address while not disclosing any information regarding the receiving address or security precautions surrounding the private or public keys related to the address.
In order to access bitcoins on the secure address at least three out of five private keys needs to be used in conjunction in order to access any funds. Private keys will be kept at devices built specifically in order to store private keys in a safe way. The devices are also protected with a pin-code. The devices will be held by key shareholders and company executives separately in separate bank vaults.

We can confirm that we are buying all the coins in the open market. At this stage through Bitstamp, Bitfinex and OKCoin. We do not buy coins from KnC for the ETN!

Doing our best and we are working to resolve this quickly

Yeah. Understand that, but these actions sometimes takes some time since we operate in a strictly regulated environment.
@_date: 2016-06-08 18:47:12
Good thinking.
But since I can't give you an exact reply, would you prefer me to send a personal email as soon as we are back online again?

You have a very valid concern and We are looking at solutions for this type of situation. Although since we operate within a strict regulatory framework we will always have to abide by their requirements.
@_date: 2016-06-03 08:18:13
I understand your concern. We are working with Nasdaq to resolve this and presented a new guarantor yesterday. We are continuing the discussions later today in and are hoping for a swift resolution as well.
If we get no resolution soon, we will set up solutions for everyone to be able to sell. Therefore there is no risk of "getting stuck" in that sense.
If any questions or concerns at all, let me know.

Yes their core business was to mine bitcoins. Mining secures the network and in reward for securing the network a bitcoin miner have a chance of receiving 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes.
The halving decreases that reward by 50 percent, from 25 to 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes, thus effecting their revenue stream directly.
Since we do not get our income from securing the network, but instead through our 1 percent yearly management fee, a reduction in newly minted bitcoins will not have a negative impact on our business in any direct way.
You could almost argue that it will impact us in a positive way since the halving generated a huge amount of publicity for bitcoin. Additionally, some argue that the halving might have a positive impact on the price of bitcoin which would be a good development for our business.

Since we hold all the coins, such a solution would only be for regulatory purposes, since one guarantor is enough if it needs to fulfill its promise.
Since the purpose is for more security and clarity, it might just create a more complex situation and thus bring undesired results from a regulatory perspective.
It's great of you to bring up this type of idea though! Since we always are looking for more secure and trustworthy solutions.

Normally Nasdaq Nordic only allow regulated entities to issue instruments on the exchange. We were given an exemption from this rule under the condition that we adopted a strict framework for corporate governance and had a guarantor of the instruments in place in order to provide additional protection for investors. As a bitcoin company it would have been hard to obtain a regulated status. Nasdaq has been very reasonable and constructive in our discussions and we hope to be able to present either a new regulated owner or a new guarantor before mid-week in order to meet Nasdaq’s requirements.
We will keep updating here, on Twitter, in our newsletter and on our website as soon as there are any developments. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 08:14:16
Thank you for your understanding.
I understand that it is hard to have faith in something without the full insight. But seeing this from the inside, I can assure you that since we are fully hedged, we will have no problems fulfilling our obligations to our investors.

We will meet with them on Monday and hope trading will resume as normal ASP.
The head of the Nasdaq Issuer Surveillance team claimed that the filing for bankruptcy by KnC Group got her to take this action as they are listed as a guarantor of the instrument. KnCs filing do not, however, in any way affect XBT Provider or the instrument. We have a strong financial standing, have always hedged the liabilities to investors 100% and operate totally independent of KnC Group.
We will publish all new information on the news section of our web-site and on our twitter account. We hope that Nasdaq will release the halt during the Monday trading session and will do everything in our power to make that happen.

We will meet with Nasdaq on Monday and will get back with information as soon as we know anything more. Neither XBT Provider as a company nor any of its assets or the hedge for the Certificate is affected in any way by the KnC bankruptcy filing. We hope this will be resolved ASAP.

We are using a combination of dedicated hardware cold storage and multi-sig distributed amongst multiple independent parties with legal and process structures for second layer protection.

Our current goal is to get a new guarantor approved by Nasdaq this week so that trading can resume as normal. I do not know how long time they normally take, but they are as eager as we are to resolve the situation and we believe they can act fast if we present a new guarantor that has a good standing, and meets their requirements. We have asked for the option to only be on the buy side of the order book, but they have decided to keep the order book closed until a new guarantor is in place.
We understand your concerns about the increase in price. If the guarantor takes too long time to get approved, we are working to have the redemption program up and running within the week.
We will keep updating about how this guarantor or redemption program is progressing here, on Twitter and our website, and if you have any concerns, just let us know, and we'll try to handle them ASAP.

1. We are not planning to liquidate the ETN and will continue our operation as normal. We are fully hedged in bitcoin and XBT Provider's operation is totally independent from KnC. Furthermore, we expect to find a new owner to KnC's shares and guarantor that will improve greatly on our standing in terms of counterparty risk.
2. We will continue to hedge as usual. XBT Provider has normally not sourced any bitcoins from KnC but on the open market. We trade with Bitstamp, Gemini, Kraken, OKCoin, Itbit and Coinbase Exchange as well as with leading OTC trading desks.

Nasdaq paused our instruments since our guarantor KnC Group went bankrupt.
Our investors are, however, never at any risk since we are 100 percent hedged and their investment is following the bitcoin price 1:1. as soon as our instruments are back online again, they will have access to them, and the updated price, just as before.
@_date: 2016-05-30 07:03:12
Thanks for your reply. KnC has been our guarantor, however, it is not the other way around. Therefore KnC are not affecting our instruments. 
Since we are 100 percent hedged, our investors funds are in bitcoin and will be available to them as soon as NASDAQ activated our instruments again.
We are meeting them today and will keep you all updated on how things progress. 
Just let us know, Reddit, Twitter or email, if any further questions!

Currently, the bitcoin market is the only crypto currency market that we feel have deep enough liquidity for us to offer an instrument to a reasonable cost for the investor. The costs of setting up an FCA approved instrument and managing the two day settlement gap between listed instruments and cryptocurrencies require a certain minimum amount of liquidity and investor demand.
We are of course looking at alternative currencies. But feel that additionally to the lack of liquidity, no non-Nakamoto-consensus-based currency has yet proven to be viable.
