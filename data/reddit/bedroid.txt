Noted. Next time I'll make sure to use "is" instead...
@_date: 2017-02-22 21:34:41
I don't think we'll see too much of a dip, back down to $1,000 at worst however it seems far more likely to keep running up and even potential for a short squeeze taking it much higher in the near-term in my opinion...
@_date: 2017-02-22 22:20:15
Also, I found some really good information on Bitcoin short interest here
 
@_date: 2017-02-22 22:16:52
So, "Is" a Bitcoin short squeeze on the way?
@_date: 2017-02-22 21:22:40
Thanks! You are correct, I fixed the typo
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:17:44
please create an option to escalate tickets on  as this is more secure. there are too many hacks out there to be submitting anything via third parties like that
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:32:46
please let us know if you have had the same problem!
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:02:25
which do you think it will hit next, $3,000 or $3,500?

Update: after 2 weeks I finally received this withdrawal. Its too bad that things like this take so long to get resolved on Kraken.com however I do appreciate that the funds eventually arrived. Kraken has some serious improvements that need to be made to both their trading platform and their support service if they want to be one of the big exchanges for the industry. I hope the various issues encountered on Kraken are scaling challenges of a rapidly growing tech business and can be resolved.

i have already created a support ticket and sent a few emails as well. please send my withdrawal wire payment, thank you!

Have a read of this article from gambling.org if you're [curious about bitcoin gambling sites](
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:42:10
This article from gambling.org discusses bitcoin gambling sites and provides information on what bitcoin really is and how blockchain technology works. Also talks about the mysterious Bitcoin visionary Satoshi Nakamoto.

No that is not it. The same thing happened last week and I had buy orders in above the price it had fallen down to that were not executed. There is something going on that's not legit for sure. The big question is does kraken know or are they involved or is it hackers that they can stop. I'm not sure but will find out!

You can find an updated list of bitcoin casinos at [bitcoincasinos.cash]( along with a current list of bitcoin cash gambling websites as well.

what do you know... kraken.com is offline again as bitcoin price starts crashing...
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:47:05
i have contacted kraken support several times on such problems with order issues in the past and they never get resolved. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:48:21
on euro side i just saw the same thing where it jumped from 3,550 euros to 3,700 euros. what the ?? is kraken hacked or just a scam?
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:48:14
well said, hence the search for a more reliable exchange
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:41:44
how high can it really go? i've been watching this only for a few months but very closely in this time. i've traded markets and parabolic equities but have never seen anything like bitcoin's rise before, its already historic but maybe just still beginning...
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:17:14
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:42:52
did anyone go short and ride it all the way down?
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:13:32
Its seen a decent pullback since hitting new ATH earlier today/ BTC is now around $2,719. Can it really make it to $3,000 today or is there more pullback to come just like after hitting them ATH pf $2,700. That's the money question that remains to be seen. Hopefully that was it but only the big money really knows and even then I think its not certain...
