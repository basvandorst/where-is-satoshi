But my cousin Bobby Sue said that the gubmint is in debt. I remember when maw got in debt once and the bad men came and take maw's Cadillac away. Faith and credit? I put my faith in Gawd. Gold, I can touch, so I can trust it. I heard some of the debt is owned by furriners, when the Chinese come and take our Cadillacs what then?

I'm not going to get into the foreign relations bit and I'm not really sure how much worse it can get than the clown we've got now, but do you really think putting a gold bug crackpot in charge of the executive branch is a good idea?

Welcome to the crypto currency subs, where gambling, investment, and bizarro world economics like "the fed is a scam" get all mixed up and make hilarious mutant babies together

Crypto currency fanatics believe that fractional reserve banking systems are perpetually a hair's breadth away from Weimar-grade hyperinflation. They basically lifted the entire gold bug mantra and swapped a few words

Try driving through the deep south while brown with $10k cash and see what happens if a cop sees it.

I wonder when they will add basic stuff like "being able to answer customer service questions on stalled transactions from weeks ago" or "being able to process a simple transaction without choking and doing something random instead"

But they're part of the **system**, *maaaaaan*. They just want to keep the little guy from getting rich quick.

I'm amused by all the people shitting themselves because they dumped their life savings into buttcoins at $18k, while at the same time there's this thread about how the SEC is just a Big Money conspiracy to keep Joe Sixpack from getting rich quick.

Here's what he's trying to say. Suppose some banking systems moved off a gold standard. Now suppose one of these banking systems was shortly thereafter in a unique quandary with respect to heavy monetary reparations payable to other countries that it had started a war with. Now since this hypothetical country is in an unwinnable situation from a policy point of view, suppose they elect to devalue their currency in a futile effort to exert some control no matter how meaningless over the nature of their "punishment". Now suppose this results in a vicious cycle of hyperinflation and many ~~Germans~~citizens of that country suffer in some fashion. If this happened, there might be some other people around the world who, ignorant of the historical context, blame the loss of the gold standard instead of say, unwisely invading your neighbors and getting your ass handed to you.
Just a hypothetical but it just goes to show you that a lot of people are given to latching onto simplistic explanations because economics is hard.

I bought a one way ticket the day of the flight with cash once after 9/11. It's not like I wanted trouble, it's just that there were circumstances.

Duopolies are kinda shitty though, that's effectively what we've got in our political parties and look where that got us.
Three is the lucky number, and I don't mean "two experienced providers and a tiny disorganized third option that only exists to give the illusion of choice"
