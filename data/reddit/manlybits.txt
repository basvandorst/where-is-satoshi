Just wait until your computer is fully synced up with the blockchain. Then you will have access to your coins.
If you can not wait, export you private keys (much more complicated than said) and import them into a service such as blockchain.info that does not require you to download the entire blockchain.
@_date: 2012-12-04 00:07:45
From what I understand ( I only took an online cryptography class) when you send a bitcoin it is braudcasted as "I am sending xxx.xxx bitcoins to qqqqqq".
A bitcoin isnt a certain hash or string of texts. When a client sees (in the blockchain) that you received that "message" it knows you have received coins. And if they haven't been spent, you can send a similar message to someone else. 
If you want to move clients, you only need those 2 keys, the public and private. 
How the "message" is verified is beyond me. I have a vague understanding of mining and difficulty, and blocks and such, but the technical side I have not spent much time researching. 
@_date: 2012-09-08 12:59:13
With 180Mh/s you are wasting your time and money. You will probably pay more for electricity than you will make with that. The difficulty is only going up, ASICs will make the difficulty skyrocket, and reward halfing is coing up (when the reward is no longer 50 BTC, but 25). Right now isnt the time to get into mining.

If you wish to still use blockchain.info:

Most likely they logged into your blockchain.info account and stole your coins. Check your computer for any keyloggers.
Otherwise you could try setting up an offline wallet on a clean computer that will never see the internet. [It's quite easy to set up with Armory](
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:22:07
The easiest thing to do would be import and use your wallet on blockchain.info (but I don't recommend you keep your life savings on there.)
You may feel more secure with a client on your home computer. So you need to import your backed-up wallet to the new client- Multibit.
Now importing your wallet to a new client wont be easy. (You need to change the wallet format to something multibit can understand or send all the BTC to an address multibit generated) If you want help doing this, just ask :)

@_date: 2013-03-25 21:42:30
You may need to have the client rescan the blockchain. This can be done by shutting down the client, and restarting it with the option "-rescan"
This can be done by opening cmd and typing "C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" -rescan
..Or if this doesnt work, "C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" -rescan
This will take some time to complete.

BACKUP YOUR WALLET
If you need immediate access to your coins, you can easily import your wallet to blockchin.info [here.](
Reinstall the client, but delete blockchain that is curretly stored. (I dont use mac, so I'm assuming it's located around ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/)
Next, if re installing the client doesn't work, there are some alternative clients that would work, but some do require bitcoin-qt to be running(such as armory). A lightweight client that doesn't need the bitcoin-qt or sometimes even the blockchain would be [Electrum]( or [Multibit](

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. I've seen many people lose their entire lives because they invested everything and lost it all. 
I personally own quite a few ASICMINER shares. I believe it is a great investment, but of course I have money elsewhere in case things go sour. 
Some passthroughs allow you to exchange them for real shares. As for leaving shares in a passthrough, or exchange them for real shares- 
1. A passthrough owner may screw you over. Most of the guys are well trusted, but they might screw you over and not pay dividends or they might run.
2. You may want to quickly sell your shares. If you are on a passthrough, that is easy. If you have real shares, it is much more time consuming and difficult to sell.
3. Some passthroughs charge a fee, or may take a few days to transfer. Don't expect to try and make a profit by buying cheap shares on one passthrough, exchange them to another passthrough, and sell them for a higher price. All this will do is take the passthrough owners and friedcats time.

According to [this chart]( you should be getting around 500 Mhash/s. 
Then you can head [here]( and plug in the 500 Mhash/s (plus whatever other info you want.) Assuming the difficulty doesnt change too much, you should produce .0576 BTC a day. 
So about 18 days to mine 1 BTC. All in all, the difficulty WILL go up, a lot. As more and more ASICs ship, the difficulty will skyrocket, making it too expensive for GPUs to mine for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-09 00:33:51
You need to have the entire blockchain downloaded. If you just recently installed Multibit, this could take a while to download. I've personally never used Multibit, but Bitcoin-Qt took about a day to fully download the blockchain.

A hot wallet is a wallet that is loaded up, private keys and all, to be used for any transactions. It is considered "unsafe" because hackers have easier access to this than a cold wallet. So a minimal amount is stored on a hot wallet.
A cold wallet is a wallet that is for storage of bitcoin. It is unloaded (and the computer probably isn't even connect to the internet) so that hackers have a harder time to access all of your stored coins. 
Usually only people with massive amount of bitcoin or companys use this technique.

Your chain should be correct. There is just a transaction that you signed that will never confirm.
To fix your client(30BTC transaction that wont confirm): 
1. Exit and reopen. (Probably wont work but worth a try.)
2. Run bitcoin-qt with the -rescan option. (This will take some time depending on your system.)
The 19 BTC is most likely in a change address. You can confirm this by sending a transaction of ~19BTC (after the 30BTC transaction is removed) or you can import your wallet to blockchain.info [here.](
