I'm 27 and have a decent job (I save around 60% of my salary per month). I have a family, but they are not massively dependent on me. I just started investing in Bitcoin recently. I'm planning to put 35% of my total savings on Bitcoin/eth/ltc , and thereafter invest 10-15% of my salary each month.

Yes it could. But then there are thousands of people willing to invest thousands of dollars on bitcoin, which would shoot the price right up.

Here's the whole thing:
I sent $684 worth of Bitcoin from an Indian Bitcoin wallet (I'm from India) with $0.58 of Bitcoin transaction fees.
I received $673 worth of BTC in Jaxx wallet. 
The transaction says that $3.47 was used for bitcoin mining.
I don't know where the remaining $7 went!

A second one?

Because when you do that, you might earn more money, but you won't earn an equivalent amount of bitcoins in the long run

In what relation exactly? 
1 USD = 65 INR.
Is 1 BTC = 65$??

I am using Jaxx wallet, which has that option. I have set the mining fee to default (average mining fees). Copying my response from previous reply:
