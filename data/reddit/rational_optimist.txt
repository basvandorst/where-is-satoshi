If you want real gains buy bitcoin, send it to exchange and buy altcoins. Most altcoins will outpace BTC.

Viva Bitcoin.

You're right, I'm wrong. Apparently Segwit is the way to go for minimizing fees. I use my Nano as permanent cold storage so that's why I was confused.

I feel like that is too traceable but theoretically it would make POS coins rocket.

8k by Xmas, 25k by the end of 2018

Nah I'll buy the dips and keep holding. If you that risk averse put your $$ in bonds.

Bad analogy, beanie babies are not revolutionary technology. I feel like you can't be serious.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:11:23
My thoughts exactly. Especially if you sum the BCG and Segwit2x forked coins, it might even be as high as 12k.

I'd imagine it would help bitcoin with notoriety and one more avenue to transfer fiat to crypto, if Google did this, it would hardly qualify as a competiting product to bitcoin as they would be trying to accomplish different things.

Buy a hardware wallet for them, put bitcoin on it, give it to them and show them how to access, send and receive bitcoin. Done.
I know this might cost you an extra $80-100 to buy the hardware wallet but they'll more than appreciate physically holding the gift you gave them and the piece of mind. 
Alternate paper wallet, show them how to set it up, done. Less safe, but might be enough to get them into it and figure out better ways to store it long-term.

So 50 mil BTC meaning 50,000,000 mBTC, got it.
No need to add the USD equivalent, that sh*t has been outdated years ago.

Cogent. Why is rarely addressed, in-writ most of the time people mean 'why' they really mean 'how'.
