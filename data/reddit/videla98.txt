I agree but "It's not even money" is a stupid argument and not an adult discussion

Yeah I study Systems Engineering and learning programming is much more efficient from a video than from a book because those are practical subjects. More theoretical subjects can and most of the time are much more expanded on a book imho

You can search pdfs easily and there are lots of books that are freely available. Also libraries are a thing in most countries I think. When I'm talking about books I'm not specificaly talking about a physical one, tho I understand that that might not be obvious  
Edit: Also as I said, I'm not saying using Youtube or Google isn't a valid way of learning. I'm saying that one cannot replace the other, as they serve different purposes

So what are you offended? It's obvious you don't read and have the nerve to tell me I'm objectively wrong instead of presenting your opinion as such. You can get the gist of a book in a video, but you can't claim to comprehend the intricacies of a complex idea in a 20 minute boildown

I'm not trying to downplay Youtube by any means, I learn a lot of if not the mayority of things I learn there. But books are much more dense in information, it's the culmination of a person's knowledge most of the time and those take years to write and refine. You can't expect to find the same quality of information in a 20 minute Youtube video that probably was made in a week or two. Again, I'm not saying videos are not a valid way of learning, it's just that books tend to be way more impactful

I disagree, books are much more in depth than a Youtube video. You just have to read a couple to find out. Have a nice day
