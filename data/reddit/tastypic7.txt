If I sold 1 btc for 530 on an exchange, and then an hour later bought 1.02 btc @ 515 - do I need to pay capital gains on the $15 or does It calculate differently? Also would this be under the short or long term % cap gains?

Google searches are different for everyone based on a number of factors including search history, I, computer type, browser type, location, etc.
But I will agree there are a lot less undereducated, misinformed generalizations being made in reference to btc.

This guy sounds like a dick. Sucks that you forgot your password, but you're being sarcastically condescending to people who are trying to help.

The top 20% control more wealth than the bottom 80% combined! I am an 80 percenter! (disclosure: my math may or may not add up)
