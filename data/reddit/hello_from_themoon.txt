Bitcoin didn't do shit.
Your brother's obsession over easy money and being rich did him in. When you are a money worshipping ultra-consumerist then your life is gonna suck no matter what.
Bitcoin is supposed to give you freedom, if you end up obsessing over numbers on coinmarktcap or your wallet or your bank account, there's nobody to blame but yourself.
Even if he had gotten 500M from bitcoin then what? Would he buy himself some expensive fleet of cars, a yacht and a private jet?
I know of a bunch of people who had a yacht and a private jet who ended up killing themselves.
Don't get lost in the forest

I have never in my life had a banknote rejected because 'it might be fake'.
additionally there are plenty of ways to 'fake' bitcoin, for example by using a compromised wallet or a compromised network.
