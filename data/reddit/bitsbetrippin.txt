This trailer is just a preview to an episode we are putting together. Shooting for early this week.

Ironically we were going to do an episode on how to use one in Vegas @ HashersUnited and the one there stopped working.
Sorry to hear/read that thread... That is a nightmare

Good evening,
Most of you probably don't know us, but Bits Be Trippin is a popular Youtube Channel covering all things crypto (hardware wise) and just breaching into working more in the software testing/review analysis. We have just over 3500 subscribers and pushing 300k views. Modest numbers, but not bad considering the genre is still coming into its own. We will be attending the Chicago BTC event next week and hope to continue to bring awareness of the Bitcoin ecosystem to the masses. Thanks for checking us out and don't forget to let us know what you would like us to test/review.

The target was simple. People say its to late to buy bitcoin, but they operate in the context of 'full' units. BBT approached the subject by providing a rudimentary spreadsheet showing if you just did incremental buys over a period of time how much bitcoin would you accumulate leveraging coin based incremental purchase feature. I know coinbase is not everyone's favorite, however, if you park the basic hatred for it for a second and think in the context of the general populous that are not going to acquire bitcoin any other way than a 'reputable' source that is well known, how would they get into purchasing on an incremental path.
The tutorial we put together aims for that group to help demystify the notion you need a full unit and that functionally the tools are in place for you to automate the participation process.
We are looking for the next topic to tackle in this faction. What would people like to see? Wallets? Exchanges? Trading? ; we can approach a clear/concise and to the point video in this fashion. We know its not perfect, but it's a start.
It's 8 minutes, but should keep your attention

Until we can pull back the hood on the phone a bit, to really see the advantages and other features provided right now it just seems it's a hardware wallet built into a smartphone with flagship specs for the time. However there is a potential dark horse type of situation here. If some clean UX based solutions come out of it, like easier payment gateway functions or asset layer functionality like we have done with the Boring Not a Flamethrower in this video [ , 'use cases' could become very interesting on meta tagging transactions on crypto-networks, thus driving up tx's and cryptographic 'proofs' of information linked to a wallet that you wish to share the public key to. This is the Asset Layer feature we are working on, first phase completed. Technically, the portability of it could move to other UTXO cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin.

First post had broken link;
Heya everyone,
We just wrapped up a format change to the channel and our first video after that format change (due to community feedback) ... 
In this video we have created a timelapse of a simple litecoin rig build from scratch using an 8ft piece of angle aluminum and a 8ft piece of 1" by 2" pine. Were going to be finishing Part 2 which is the timelapse build on the pc /w 5x R9 280x cards due out later this week.
Please let us know what you think! This channel is for you all!
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:58:52
We have just completed shooting video showing multiple comparisons of mining rigs with various configs on the following cards:
Sapphire R9 290X
Saphire R9 280X
XFX R9 270X
XFX R7 240
Gigabyte 7970 3GB (1000 core)
Gigabyte 7970 3GB GHZ Edition (1100 core)
Diamond 7970 3GB (925 core)
Powercolor 7970
XFX 7850OC
(essentially I bought every card at best buy and microcenter in my area)
In addition we analyzed each card (using an EVGA 1300 Supernova and Corsair 750w PSU) with a Kill-a-watt monitor along with thermals both in case and open/exposed /w exteral fan cooling. As a bonus we put one box that was running 90c on the GPU in a garage with the outside temp at 9 degree's to watch its performance change.
First video goes up Sunday with others throughout next week.

Please share with the world, get the word out!
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:38:34
Thanks! Please share in your circles if you know others that are into Bitcoin etc ... Cant wait to get this first video up (in post processing now) ... ton's of great information!

Bits Be Trippin is a new YouTube Channel with its first Episode to be released 12/12/13. The channel is focused on bringing information from Bitcoin and alt currency to the people through a review type of format.
Episode List include:
Episode 1 - Detailed analysis on power usage and temps with 6 different pc configurations, cases, psu and graphics cards. What are steps you can do to reduce overhead while hashing
Episode 2 - Walkthrough building a mining rig from buying parts, putting together, downloading wallet/mining software and configuring scrypt for optimal hash 
Episode 3 - Custom mining rig (indoor basement - take temps) (outdoor - garage in midwest/winter) take temps | how does ambient vs below freezing hurt/help a computer - what are the risk with leaving it in a garage
Episode 4 - How to adjust script to get faster rates (show breakdown of what switches in code actually mean such as thread concurrency, shaders etc.
Episode 5 - Graphics Card Shootout R9 270X vs R9 280X vs R9 290X on hashrates, bonus to include detail hashrate configurations on multiple machine/psu combo's
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:00:35
Tune into 
We have a video next week that will walk even the most novice user through the process
