What about something other than words?

This guy's a manwhore
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:00:45
Have you heard of the internet?
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:00:11
Because those people doing TA need to make a buck somehow.
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:13:17
Expedia, egifter, Shopify, Dish, Gyft, CheapAir, and that little known one, Microsoft.

I was gonna hodl the coin, but then I got high...
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:42:42
Never, tbh
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:41:00
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:23:46
I hope you're right. We could all use another 30-bagger. :)

Ripple went from a penny to 35 cents of more in the recent past. That ship has sailed. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:43:53
This I know
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:39:54
Because you will eventually sell high and watch it go higher, potentially not returning to a lower value for a long time.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:12:16
What you did worked out well for you. It could have played out differently.  Wish I had done the same. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:35:48
Grabbed a bit at 1986 today during the dip. Looking forward to getting some more sub2k next week.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:10:15
I think you're wrong. It is $1990 right now.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:15:39
Needs some Lumens 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:37:41
Hope you grabbed during the dip you predicted! 
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:35:20
I bought today at 1986

Seriously.  Here a down payment is 3x that for a small place.
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:09:53
You got it by now for sure
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:45:56
Tldr: no one knows, but here are some possibilities of what could happen 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:58:54
What happens to those lost coins?  Do we have an idea of how many coins are actually in circulation of all those mined or do we just know the total number mined?  
I wonder how many people made blunders like this.  Could there be a million unusable coins out there which would make the accessible ones much more rare?
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:40:50
My flair is "redditor for a day." That's great. If I could remember the password for my other account I would not be this green appearing.

Not much of a rind on you...
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:01:41
You mean flippening?
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:12:53
Article also from 3rd June 2017. What sorcery is this?
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:12:59
This. I forgot the password to an account tied to my old phone and didn't have an email recovery. Stupid, I know. I had to make a new acct and deal with that "for one day" tag.

@_date: 2017-06-07 20:17:26
Thanks, but the continuation needs more jpeg. :)
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:09:48
I just bought a coin last week above 2700. No worries here. This is a long term play.
