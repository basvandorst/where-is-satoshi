I guess I just look at the days that bitcoin has been profitable or a good store of value and hold that against gold which has been seized before. To each their own, but I don't think your numbers hold water.
Edit, gold is harder to travel with or leave the country with. Or to sell.

While I am a believer in this technology and am here to stay regardless of price, I do think the coming recession will increase the price of bitcoin. We're talking about a global financial situation with millions of people holding trillions of dollars of wealth that will shortly be looking for a real store of value.
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:20:29
Bitcoin will be volatile while it gets priced in the market. No argument here. However, it's like 60 days total in the last 10 years that buying bitcoin would not be profitable. Also, where did the house thing come from. We're not arguing for fiat and I'm not saying bitcoin is ready to be used as a medium of exchange for a home. No way would I spend bitcoin like that today anyways.

If any exchange participates in fractional reserve lending, they can expect to lose thier customers. You're also right. If they do this and enough people test them, they would be insolvent.

There's a lot of hostility towards bitcoin from the truly uninformed. While I can't presume to know why, I'd bet my shoes that the elite are pushing FUD as much as possible to keep the price as low as they can while they buy as much as they can before mass adoption. The elite didn't, for the most part, get rich beyond imagination by being total fools.

I agree that bitcoin will limit big government but I would argue that the main issue of government isn't funding public projects. Healthcare, education, infrastructure is what government is intended to do and given a real hard currency like bitcoin, it will be able to function in a way that benefits the largest amount of people. Without excessive spending and a always inflating monetary supply, the government could be able to remain solvent without resorting to income taxation.
The idea that large corporations will become more ethical and responsible with less regulation doesn't make sense. That's not how greed works.
In regards to the fire and police area, what incentive would insurance companies have to fund and manage a fire and police departments for the entire country? While it may be doable at a local level, the idea that one company could manage that doesn't seem feasible. And if we're talking about local co-ops, I can see that assuming all those living in the area have a minimum level of income. I don't see that working on a large scale however.
It would be amazing if a bitcoin world would allow these types of scenarios to play out as I think there is a ton that humanity can learn. I believe that at the end of the day, we need to find a system that works for and protects the majority of the people not just the elite. By means of bitcoin or otherwise.

First off, major points for even asking. It looks like you work for Trezor in some way and being open to improvements is a huge plus in my book. 
As for the UI, it feels outdated and old right out of the box. Updating firmware is a bit of a process and even after updating, it still shows an update is needed. I also prefer the layout and function of the ledger Android based system used as a bridge. From what I've seen, trezor only has the web application. Also, while not being a computer engineer by any stretch, I am somewhat functional with computers and the initial setup process was more difficult than I would've preferred.
Edit: I really want a premium option.

I'm betting (not literally) that a high roller(s) are pumping shitcoins therefore weak btc holders jump ship to alt and new investors pour money in. Once that happens, btc is undervalued and "they" dump all the alt coins at a huge profit and move into BTC.
