Pretty cool, but strange that they limit their transactions to whatever btc is worth 300,000  yen. Maybe there’s some kind of business law where spending more than that raises a flag? 
Anyone living in Japan(except Ver) got anything?

If you believe in cryptocurrency as a whole, your investment in ETH will not be a waste. 
Trust in decentralized.

You’re not the only one who’s thought that, believe me.

Pay off your loans when you can. If things go to shit after the fork, and it takes another 2 years to recover, you’ll regret not being done with your loans early.

Stupid people will lose money in stupid ways no matter what they do. The fact that Las Vegas is a money magnet that draws in thrill-seekers is proof of this. 
At least by offering BTC up, he’s bringing awareness of it into a public eye. They could also take their money and use it for forex trading, but no reward comes without risk.

Not sure if trolling or legit stupid, because some people would actually think this is a good idea.

Great stuff, my dude, this is the success story of patience and good execution. 
If you haven’t already, go get yourself something nice; your coins will grow more than what you spent in fiat by that point anyways :)

This sounds dark but this is actually my plan. If I ever get diagnosed with a terminal disease that will make my final years a misery, I'm going to go out on my own terms. 
Why should I waste the time and money just suffering? At that point I'd much rather tell everyone that I've had a great time and it's time for me to excuse myself. Instead of spending tens of thousands to die in a hospital bed, I'll just die at home. My kids and their kids could use that money.

Just do a quick search for HODL and you’ll find the thread. I don’t know if BTC will easily explode in doubles or triples like it did before, but it has a strong reputation of doing so, and the long-term speculation is strong. If you’ve currently lost money, then the best thing is to believe whole-heartedly that it will resurge. 
No point in trying to surf the big waves when you’re not even sure what they look like. Ironically I understand the technical aspects of BTC more than I do for trading... guess that’s why I’m a software engineer ಠ_ಠ
