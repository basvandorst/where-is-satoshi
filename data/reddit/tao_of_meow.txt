[CoinBeyond is releasing a special beta payment app on Tuesday Nov 25th to make it easier to spend Bitcoin in person and online for Bitcoin Black Friday]( 
We are trying to be the friendliest way for regular people to use Bitcoin. We'd love feedback from the community about our beta launch.

The team at [Coinbeyond]( is working (literally) day and night to bring a debit card like this to market, backed by automated hierarchical deterministic multisig consumer protection. It's awesome to read this kind of feedback from the community.  I agree, in order to facilitate mass adoption, regular people need to be able to use bitcoin for everyday purchases as easily as they already spend their money.

Understood by world's smartest people. :P

You missed CoinBeyond in the Payments section and Bitcoin Magazine in the News section.

Well I probably wouldn't, but I can see how someone in Iceland might. The idea of having a currency that is reasonably specific to your own country still has merits even in a world with a decentralized global digital currency.

I know of several restaurants in the Pacific Northwest that accept bitcoin, but your site wouldn't let me add them. I would suggest that you enable a write-in option for submitting new locations.

The are registered in all 50 states. They have invested a lot time and money to become compliant with all applicable MSB regulations including AML and KYC.

I was 23, but check out this video a friend made of [his 3 year old buying her first Bitcoin.](

I once bought him a smoke and in return, he heard our pitch and gave us like over an hour of his time and feedback. Truly a wonderful human being.

Freaking awesome! Knot count? What is it made of?

Are you looking for a technical non-programming role, or more along the lines of project or product management, UI/UX or graphics designer, or something entirely different like marketing or sales?   
What is it about the Bitcoin industry that you feel drawn to? 
@_date: 2015-10-06 05:59:53
Super stoked. Quality lineup! 
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:26:41
Pretty charmed life if that't the case.

If Shopify adds functional bitcoin payment support, I would switch my business to their platform. Like, today. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 01:53:58
I didn't realize I was so outside the norm. Are these demographics roughly consistent with Reddit's userbase? Do you guys (apparently) think that women will have to get on board with using and buying bitcoin in order for it to have long term success?
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:23:28
So....what should we do? Is there any effective way this forum could respond and push for more informed coverage? He's done retractions/revisions on past issues when a lot of people have complained loudly. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 04:30:56
you mean wasn't cool.
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:09:48
Agreed. They have resolved every preivious issue with complete integrity, even if it did take a little while. They guys running coinbase are extremely solid San Francisco tech geniuses. They will figure this mess out. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 10:09:29
nice work!
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:01:15
This is true. They are not a scam, just scrambling. Solid SF tech industry crew, lots of reputation and experienceand and backed by YC. There is 0 chance these guys will ever take anyone's money and run. I personally want to go work for them, and I'll be applying early next month. Genius guys with too much success on their hands. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 08:32:34
This is actual kind of genius. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-13 15:25:31
Thank you, that was my best guess. Are you then obligated to complete the transaction? If you placed many orders over a period of time couldn't you then only complete the orders which had changed in your favor and pocket the difference in value, at the expense of the exchange? If so is this risk just a cost of doing business for them?
@_date: 2013-04-17 03:34:36
YES. I would pay bitcoins for that.
