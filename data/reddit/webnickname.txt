Also, this is so far removed from what is needed to activate, I don't know why we're getting excited.   At this rate it looks like it will literally never happen unless they change the requirements.

There is no way segwit reaches consensus..  But I'll happily wait and see

Blockstream's goal

Sorry bro, you can not like the idea of taxes and that's fine.  But most countries make you pay taxes.   If you don't pay, which is your choice, you can go to jail.  I have a family and a kid.   I'm not going to jail over what amounts to scraps for me.   
Doesn't make me some weird statist.

Hey thanks, can you link me to a  source explaining this just so I can feel more comfortable going forward if it applies to me? 
Edit.   I misunderstood, that means you owe zero if your taxable income is under 70k married correct?   Not that you only owe if what you sell is more than 70k profit

Because they claim, allegedly, there is massive censorship that takes place here.

The other Bitcoin community already has a pretty big deal in place with the_donald, unfortunately you waited too late

There is zero chance segwit gets 95% consensus.  Feel free to rub this in my face forever if I'm wrong, but I won't be.   
You'd be hard pressed to find 95% of people to agree on anything.

Listen man, lol, I don't like taxes either.  Unfortunately, that's our reality at the moment.  So... I'll continue to try and stay out of jail to raise a good family.  Sorry if that bothers you.

OK yeah that's what I figured I was just confused with how he worded it.   Thanks a lot!

In terms of precedence sure but there has never been something like this before.   We shall see.   At least it was filed in this circuit.

Vindicated in what?   Recommending that people follow the law?   What a novel idea.   I made significant profit during the big bubble and paid thousands on capital gains tax.  Don't break the law and don't worry.

They don't calculate every transfer as a sale.  This is FUD that keeps being spread.  Even Coinbase has posted in reddit refuting this.
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:23:54
Well it's true in this case man.   If you pay taxes correctly you won't get charged with tax evasion lol

Weirdly enough I have been trying to get that name too...
