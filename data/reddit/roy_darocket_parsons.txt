A smudge on the LENSE!!

buckle up!

Huh? You can’t illustrate exponential growth with two data points. I can draw a line though any two points you give me
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:48:20
I think you are both correct. Centralization is computationally efficient, but creates other problems. The author's use of "data" is a bit strange here, and I think that's what causes some confusion

yeah, I think that's what he meant here as well. Just seems like information would have been a better term, because data implies a computational element (at least to me, coming from a CS background) and there's nothing computational about this particular discussion. Also, "works better" is a vague terminology -- better at what?
The following would be clearer:
"distributed data processing works better than centralized information processing" ----&gt;
"distribution of information leads to more innovation and thus more prosperity than centralization"

you can add redundancy without fully decentralizing though

You have far too much confidence in DJT

Sure, but this is a very different position from the  “energy use is not a problem” position

Not supporting Mnuchin, but OP made a pretty serious misquote in the title. He didn't say "cash isn't used for illicit activities." He said "I don't think it's accurate at all that cash is laundered all the time."
There's a difference between laundering and using for illicit activities -- the former is but one example of the latter. It's of course impossible to prevent any currency from being used for any arbitrary illicit activity. Laundering, on the other hand, is a different and much more specific problem that some currencies are more subject to than others, and you could make an argument that an anonymous crypto (which Bitcoin is not, of course) could be more readily used for such a purpose

such sound economic advice

Not in 2015 at least: [
Edit: I see the 2019 numbers are MUCH different than 2015. Interesting

You realize Hong Kong is already part of China right?

Hmmmm, well if that’s the case than I stand corrected. But that’s not just a capital gains tax if you’re losing more than 100% of what you make — that’s a completely broken tax code.

App works really well. I don't get all of the coinbase hate around here, it's dirt simple to use and still pretty cheap even with the recent rate hikes

Why are people so opposed to kyc? If btc moons, taxation is gonna be in the small order bits, not a big deal
Or are you of the opinion that the gov is out to get you?

Decentralized consensus involving computation of one-way functions IS much harder and less energy efficient than centralized locking protocols. That’s where this argument comes from. Now leveraging these protocols for the purposes of currency brings issues such as those you allude to (eg., what if we shut down all the banks). But at the most fundamental level, no one is arguing that blockchain is energy efficient

Whales are still buying. We are pumping well over 11K I think
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:22:36

Whales are selling, what a bunch of pussies

I mean, you're probably right, but it's a lot more fun to hodl out hope

Major flop so far
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:23:50
well I guess I'm selling at 100K
