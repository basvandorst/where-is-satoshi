Ah cool was just wondering how it would work out and whether you had weighed the options. It's different here in Ireland where all capital gains are taxed at 33% ([on anything above €1270](
Yeah you definitely made the right call given the circumstances.

Solid advice. I did see some posters talk about the usual January dip of the previous years so it's not like I wasn't already informed. Too much confidence on my part. 
I actually had a set amount, that if I reached it I would cash out half and hold the rest but unfortunately I was slightly off the arbitrary point I had set for myself! Oh well, live and learn. If anything, I am confident in the future and will be probably buying more later in the week. 
You are 100% correct about the paper profits or unrealised gains versus realised gains. Next time around eh!?

I won't say how much I hit but from original investment it was around 5500% and now is down around 1700%. The reason I didn't cash out my original investment was because I would have to pay tax on it at 33% when I cash out and I honestly thought the drop over the last month would be less than 33%. 
In reality I probably would be sitting at around double my 1700% (3400%) but I stupidly didn't think the correction would be as big as this.

You don't need to answer if you don't want to, but are you going to pay taxes on money you cashed out? That is one of the reasons I didn't cash out. I thought that cashing out was essentially like accepting a -33% on my portfolio and the crash wouldn't be as extreme as previous years due to the amount of interest that been garnered over the last few months. 
I do believe you but I think as I have said above, the reason a lot of people would not want to cash out is simply because they didn't anticipate a drop as big as previous years (or 33%!) due to the amount of interest.
