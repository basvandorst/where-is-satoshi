So if I invest 1 bridgecoin I'll get 2 bridgecoins in 100 hours? Why aren't they accepting bridgecoins? I've got a bunch for sale...

Yes, this is the real reason. That's why porn affiliate programs can pay you more than a month's fee for each subscriber you bring in. The most important metric for a site is the average retention, for decent sites this is between 2.5 and 3.5 months.

I've been out of the loop for some time, but most big programs offer at the webmasters choice, either pay-per-signup or revenue-share. If you go pps, they track the sales you generate, and if they don't meet the expected retention, kick you off the program. Most of them pay over $50 on a $25~$35 signup and delay the payment 30 days, to filter out 'carders' and unusual chargeback volumes. You'll usually make more on revshare long term, but if you have traffic that converts and need quick money, you can start on pps and switch to revshare later on.

I use phoenix with the phatk kernel, AGGRESSION=12 for only mining and AGGRESSION=6 when playing, crysis 2 runs great with this, no lag at all. This is on a 6870. I had some lag no matter what AGGRESSION value when using the default (poclbm) kernel.

What a load of bullshit... I'm from and in Argentina, safe deposit boxes have not been touched by this or previous governments. While I agree this government is not full of saints, big local and multinational companies are much more responsible for inflation than the government.
