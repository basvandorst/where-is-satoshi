sounds exactly like nxt - a small group pay w bitcoins to be part of the scam...

this. seriously nvc does such a good job at flying under the radar - it was one of the original premined scamcoins, has barely any trade volume.

I think its clear based on the comments and votes in this thread that the vast majority of people support this. I for one am sick of coinmarketcaps decisions on what coins/data to display, and welcome cryptomarketcap with open arms, bookmark has been replaced!
I think its also good that we have both of these sites in their current state - so that people can easily compare which have what listed, and have a choice which they want to see, I just hope everyone knows both sites exist so they can make their choice.

yeah but they dont show enough information, its very hard to determine what is legit and what isnt based on how they present the data - this new site makes some super important and obvious improvements such as showing total coins total alongside # currently mined. Its always bothered me that coinmarketcap doesnt show this - they choose to show just enough to make these scamcoins look like they might be legitimate to people who dont do deeper research.

I think the Hello Kitty mp3 player would be more legitimate, because you know, apple and all
