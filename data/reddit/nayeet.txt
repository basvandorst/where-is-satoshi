how much is too much to keep in coinbase and why? and also, where would I keep that, in a paper wallet? if so is there a good resource with instructions for a layman on how to convert coinbase funds to a paper wallet?

let's define mainstream so we stop chasing an undefined goal. what does it actually mean? a certain percentage of a certain population is using it? then roughly what percentage? 
Edit: so far every single response has been missing the point. All of your metrics are still wishy washy. None of them can actually be reached because they can not be specifically defined.
