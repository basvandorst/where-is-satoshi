It all comes down to your target customer base. If someone sells headphones to people in San Jose, California, only Bitcoin may go well but if you are selling cheese in Myanmmar, I am not sure if only Bitcoin would work. We at Blockonomics have been helping people accept Bitcoin payments and the categories which adapt BTC quickly are mostly whose customer base has an congruence with cryptocurrencies like gadgets, games, gambling etc., We also prefer making payments through BTC too and are infact looking for a UI/UX revamp. Can you share more details of your previous work in DM?
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:13:36
But if it costs a lot to the customers, they would start preferring the traditional modes right?
 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:05:46
You are absolutely correct there! People are a bit more free handed when it comes to paying through bitcoins as there are not many takers for bitcoin payments either. This could be a USP of your service company in itself. 
That would be great! Looking forward!

If you ever plan to open a Wordpress store, do consider Blockonomics to accept Bitcoins. Segwit implemented.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:49:57
Yes, timing is actually an issue. That is a good strategy which I have heard of before. Before things get super quick, I guess such bridging methods would be popular. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:13:50
No I do not know how utxos work. Please enlighten me.

There is no reason, generally speaking, for a merchant to move around small amounts like $100. They do so on a monthly basis and the monthly revenue of an average Joe is much more than $100..
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:03:04
The one I use is Blockonomics. Payment happens directly to my wallet which is great. From what I remember the first 10 transactions are free.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:25:33
It is a game of supply and demand right. It will fall more when there are more sellers than buyers. I use blockchain.info to store my coins. If I were to sell them, I have to transfer them to an exchange and then sell and because I and others couldn't do it as quickly as before, the supply was limited but there were many buyers. This pushed the price up, I believe. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:18:25
I am not sure. I guess they would eventually. But it could be applicable to anything, say buying airline tickets online..so no one could buy tickets from expedia for the same day at the current network traffic..
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:14:20
Cool. What if I am buying on overstock.com using coins in my wallet? Do they initiate the delivery only after the transaction is confirmed?  
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:33:22
[Blockonomics]( had recently announced a lot of segwit improvements and is much less hassle alternative to Bitpay.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:23:12
Should I mail Andreas about this? :P 
If this occurs frequently merchants may not adapt bitcoins..
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:10:58
I constantly discuss Bitcoin rates with my boss as he is invested as well. I was paid in Bitcoins and my salary got increased by 50% because I couldn't convert for the last one week or so. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:08:27
What if i plan to download something immediately? Do I have to wait for days till a tx is confirmed to download a song? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:28:09
Yeah Im sure that he knows this as well :) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:06:44
So if I have $10 and I first buy something with say 20 satoshi/byte which will take days to confirm and then again I can buy something worth $10 with say 100sat/byte? 
This I know is not possible in Blockchain.info as they deduct the first 10$ but do hardware wallets allow this? Bitcoins will not then be a great choice for merchants right? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:25:42
Oh yes they do! :) That will probably be the first big purchase i'll do using bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:53:08
I've used all the three for my ecomm site and I would say 1) Blockonomics, 2) Mycelium and at a distant third 3) Bitpay. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:47:32
[Blockonomics]( has two biggest advantage: It is at flat 1% (no monthly fee), direct-to-your-wallet meaning their servers DO NOT store your Bitcoins &amp; therefore the payments are quicker. The wordpress plugins are highly rated. If yours is not a wordpress site, they also have an API.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:22:38
Mazel Tov! 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:30:43
The new lot which signed up were all looking to buy right? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:54:11
I do not have any bitcoins at the moment but that still hurt! 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:28:03
People, future's people will post the exact same thing about the tweets we do today!  
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:25:25
Great point!
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:24:36
I just checked and I think you misunderstood the policy.
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:42:55
It's funny how they can do the shittiest of things and still grow. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:51:24
June is the deadline for some.
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:07:37
I was expecting someone to point this out as rarely anything gets hidden here and its true but still went forward with it as good things are to come out of this. Thanks for your kind words.  
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:28:30
Their support staff don't agree. I suppose there has been a update in policy. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:41:29
Thanks a lot! 
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:43:06
These points needed a mention. Thanks a lot for pointing them out! 
@_date: 2018-03-13 08:56:14
At [Blockonomics]( we like to keep things simple and flawless. [Supporting Segwit]( since Dec'17 and for 1000s of customers in an uninterrupted way. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:50:10
Yeah all major platforms had to. Thanks to scammy ICOs
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:57:56
Hey Yoda! These are a few companies which Blockonomics facilitates payments for. But as always thanks for the info! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:57:02
Stability will be arrived at when the supply and demand can sustain each other. When something becomes universal, it gets difficult to move the price for silly reasons. When it becomes universal, the price changes would happen only when there is a huge technical glitch or ban by governments (which also gets difficult when something becomes universal.)

And now this .. Here is the list of **Top 5 alternatives to Bitpay** : 
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:13:27
Hey, thanks for pointing that out. I'll get that checked with our team immediately. Meanwhile, if you wish to know more, here is the link for [pricing](
@_date: 2018-02-26 07:57:49
I'd recommend [Blockonomics]( - requires only an email id. Leave the Bitpay mess behind and get started in an hour. Works smoothly for me!
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:06:24
I'll wish I could add this explanation in a description for the title but unfortunately, this is a link post. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:54:53
Hey Dude, you money is already very well invested. To increase your account balance, I'd suggest you to keep doing what you are doing. You can check out Affiliatefix.com to get started with more businesses. The sky is the limit. Feel free to check out [Blockonomics' growth partner program](
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:03:39
I think adaptation won't be a wrong choice either.. But I think you got what I was trying to convey. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:06:44
Ride the tide or swim to the tide! 
@_date: 2018-03-12 06:08:23
* Direct to wallet - Payments from clients' wallet to yours DIRECTLY
* No Hidden Fees - Flat 1% fee and that is all. 
* 2 weeks of credit allowed in case of payment fees delay. 
* Permissionless - Requires only email id to get started
* 24*7 Support
That is [Blockonomics]( for you. If this meets your requirements, feel free to pass me your email id and I'll get back with an interesting proposal. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:12:36
I agree. This is creation of a new world altogether and there are just too many functions to keep up with. Investing in a resumed list is a definitely worthy. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:40:48
You nailed the math! We are a bootstrapped startup and have limitations to work with. But I hope this will have a larger butterfly effect. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:37:43
**And its a declaration to the social networks that the community can look after itself**
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:01:40
And if they had accepted payments 5 months ago which, just to give you a feel was last thanksgiving, their coins went up by 4 times ! They would have to be sharp about it. Can't be too lazy and too rich. 
But the advantage is not in this terms. Advantageous because the stores gives a platform to a huge and growing community of btc owners like us to go and spend some of that easy-earned returns during high tides.  
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:54:06
hodling to your thought hah?

Great! You can get in touch with me at administrator 
Here are a few comments from our existing customers which can help you decide:

The best way to integrate Bitcoin payments in Woo commerce is to use a plugin. If you wish to get started immediately, Blockonomics' woocommerce [plugin]( can be installed in a few min. 
This plugin will help you receive payments directly to your wallet and just like bitcoin, you only need an email id (and Xpub key) to get started. Here is a 8 min [tutorial]( which can guide you through the process. 
In case you need assistance with the installation, we have a dedicated 24*7 chat system available for our Merchants on our Merchant's [page]( and we will be glad to help you install the plugin! 
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:42:41
Blockonomics just like Bitcoin is a permissionless payment solution.

Com'on Yoda. Had to change the title. What are your views on this? :)
