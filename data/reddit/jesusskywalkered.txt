@_date: 2018-01-12 05:22:18
That’s because of congestion in the memepool, it isn’t because the price is higher it’s because there’s more use on the chain and miners are filtering out lower fees. You can choose the fee, although depending on your wallet they may have default settings that do it for you, these are set up on a sat/byte structure and your fees raise due to data used per tx and the average fee being accepted to blocks.

You could do a smart contract that requires a 30/60/90 day log in by person a to refresh the contract and at 30 stage part of the key is released to person b 60 stage part of key released to person c 90 stage (pretty sure you’re dead or disinterested) final part of key is released to person d, all three must be together to use key, Bitcoin is distributed per your will.

Check the sidebar of this sub, lots of good links and references. Find a copy of Andreas Antonopolis’s book “The internet of money”. Use GDax and limit buy/sell to minimize fees, use a trezor or a ledger if you have more than a few thousand in US fiat invested, use Segwit and companies that support it, you can set your own fees.....Good luck.

This is total bullshit. It’s essential to LN and has to be implemented before LN rolls out. The real reason is politics and the NYA, there is a concerted effort by corporations to centralize crypto currency, in the instance of Coinbase they are engaging in fractional reserve bitcoin and they got themselves in hot water with their utxo’s, they’re underwater and Segwit won’t help them....but guess what can.....bigger blocks. The reason most wallets and exchanges don’t care about Segwit is because it doesn’t help them centralize coins around their exchanges, it actually hinders that. We are in the midst of a war for control of the crypto currency space, of services that shun Segwit and LN are adversarial foes, stop using their services.

Not imho, I try to time the dips and just hit as close to the bottom as you can, I usually hit the upswing. That's just been my experience but I'm pretty new.
Edit: if it continues to climb and it's been a bit I'll jump back in as that is the new low. I'd say buy in a bit, watch the markets, try to time it, buy in a bit more. See how it goes and get a feel for everything before jumping in both feet. Remember only spend what you can comfortably lose.

As an atheist I only believe in one less god than you. As a straight white cis male I despise your kind and will use my privilege to destroy your hold on society.

Shaw256 is quantum resistant, there’s no computer code that makes randomly guessing single digit hash faster.

@_date: 2017-11-26 10:42:46
I can....Once the last coin is mined in 2145 bitcoin will become a transaction fee based economy driven by the miners, at that point we will be at the hight of deflation and we will probably have hard forked to add decimal points so we can divide into smaller and smaller fractions of a bitcoin due to high adoption. This is all in the white paper and it’s what Satoshi planned for.

Point me to where the longest chain has been exploited, I'm all ears. If you want to talk about fork attacks, FUD attacks or MtGox like failures well that's not an exploitation of the longest chain now is it? It's also not a very good argument against a currency when all other currencies are exploited at much higher rates even when % of adoption is considered.

A trust less, peer to peer transparent ledger that list all transactions ever created, protected cryptographically....If you wanted to change the ledger you would have to do it simultaneously on every machine running the blockchain worldwide. The level of computational power to achieve this hasn't been created yet. (once it has the blockchain network will be running on machines that much faster and stronger anyways.)
Also, double spend protection.
Also......The same as any other currency, social trust.

@_date: 2017-07-20 17:12:28
Aaaaaargh!! I'm so mad at myself, I was sitting there awake as the price hits 1900, I tell myself "I'll just wait a little longer, they aren't going to signal right away it'll go lower" only to wake up to 2300 and not going back down.....cmon whales, dip this bitch again!
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:59:35
Expecting the whales to take advantage of uncertainty and ignorance to promote a panic, try to push it to sub 1900 before BIP 91 fully signals with confirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:36:52
Ahhh, that's your angle.
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:10:14

@_date: 2017-07-22 12:09:35
I suppose, if the users and miners didn't agree and held corse we'd just have two coins and both could show value.

Yeah, I'm in this for the technology...I understand how the sellers and traders think, but I think they might be missing the REAL power of the blockchain. I mean, every single contract in the world will be done on a blockchain one day, every transaction will be done on a blockchain, trustless banking in third world developing regions, real estate contracts that can not be broken or counterfeited.... It's the settlement layer for the future of global finance, trade and contracts...I have nothing to sell for.

@_date: 2017-07-22 12:02:08

@_date: 2017-07-31 03:00:14
You realize statistics of getting your PC hacked vs ANY of the scenarios you suggest is thousands of times more likely? Hackers specifically right code looking for Bitcoin software on windows pc's. If you can't keep your seed and keys safe...you don't deserve bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-06-16 05:25:45
There's plenty of info if you search the sub. From what I've learned a paper wallet is the most secure but you better follow some security protocols and then there are hardware wallets like Trezor, then lastly there are mobile wallets where you control the keys like mycelium and bread wallet. Just research or maybe someone with some links will pop by.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:40:58
Oh shit, as a designer I will be using this!!! I can't wait until the launch! Nice clean Ui.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:39:24
I swear I bought lower than that today but Coinbase was all sorts of fucked up so I can't say for certain due to my buy panic...I though I hit it around 2625 or 30 but I don't know for certain, is there a way to check each transaction to see what I buy and sell at.
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:14:21
Control your keys.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:36:23
Luckily I'm only in for $100, feeling it out, seeing if it's something I want to go full in on.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:47:04
2625....I only had $50 to put in :(
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:25:44
So, what you're telling us is, you don't understand the underlying power of cryptocurrency? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:38:47
Sure, right after it halves it's value.
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:38:41
Be very careful who you trust and research EVERYTHING! If you still have the codes you control the bitcoin, DO NOT GIVE OUT YOUR CODES!!!
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:39:36
Yes, yes they will....Do you understand what is at stake and the powers at play here?
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:30:21
I'm assuming they do, which is why the old guard don't want it.

Can't buy when Coinbase shuts their server down.
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:13:02
It will be one of two things in that scenario, successful or an abject failure.
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:43:34

@_date: 2017-06-15 06:17:40

I'm a noob too and everything I've read says don't play the dip. It's my understanding Coinbase suspended their server intentionally as they wouldn't make any money if everyone played the dips. But I don't know anything, that's just what I read this morning in a similar frustrated state.

From what I understand speculation says a fork shouldn't affect what you own if you control the keys, but it may halve your value and double your coin.....then the users should choose the chain that survives after that and the surviving coin will be the one you trade. I don't know everything I'm still pretty noob myself.

I have one local shop who lets us purchase with a typical credit/debit card, I'm trying to convince them to figure out direct bitcoin purchases as well.
