@_date: 2015-12-25 13:26:39

@_date: 2015-12-31 13:05:05
I'm going to purchase Trezor. Today with no reason Blockchain.info blocked my IP. Now I can't acces my funds in the Wallet. I don'r recommend using Blockchain!
@_date: 2015-12-31 18:20:06
Sounds good. I'm going to purchase one right away! 
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:14:17

This sub is fucked up.
@_date: 2015-12-31 20:57:08
Haha, that's a good one!
@_date: 2015-12-23 07:04:28
Nice. I want to puchase the Trezor buy it's expensive and there are no Holiday Discounts on their website yet...
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:50:03
I'm still waiting!
@_date: 2015-12-25 20:42:32
Borat! *Very NICE!* 
@_date: 2015-12-24 20:32:08
I dreamed about this.. They stole my Trezor Hardware but they were not able to crack the private key. So don't worry even Aliens can not steal your coins :)
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:54:30
Don't use Blockchain Wallet. I don't recommend it. They banned my IP for no reason and they have many 'bugs'.
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:27:24

Haha.. Newsweek.. Hey! Did you find more Nakamoto's in 2015?
@_date: 2015-12-31 11:47:26
Yes I did. But for no reason they blocked my IP. I don't understand why? 
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:22:13
I want to buy Trezor also. But at this moment too expenisive. And no discount code..
@_date: 2015-12-25 09:55:40
Merry Christmas Bitcoin Ho-ho-ho!
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:37:32
I care about the Technology. Price doesn't matter. Because when you sell you will gain. But when you buy you start all over again. It's an investment how you are seeing Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2015-06-03 08:17:30
Buy from exchanges.
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:57:32

Just found this Twitter account promoting Bitcoin to Greece. Good tweets. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 22:00:15
I think Satoshi lost his private keys that why he only spended 50BTC....
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:59:09
Moon sign?
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:15:23
Blockchain.info banned my IP. I don't recommend using Blockchain anymore!
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:28:00
Trezor is a good option. But it's pretty expensive with DHL shipping, without the Holiday Discounts..
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:54:25
I understand. It's difficult to use it for everyday use because price changes every second. It's not a National Currency. But you are right and I understand you.
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:07:08
Here in NL we can directly buy/sell any amount in BTC without restrictions. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:02:00

The price of 1 single bitcoin was in 2015 hovering between 200-250$. Price is now hovering between 400-450$ range. I don't see what your problem is?

Thanks for the hug. :)
@_date: 2014-10-14 20:46:57
Blockchain.info app works perfectly for you. If you think getting bigger amounts of BTC in the future then take a look at offline/coldstorage wallets. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:40:51
@_date: 2014-03-16 12:07:14

@_date: 2014-11-06 20:40:28
Sure. I know. I was not talking about you. Just the way Redditors in the sub react to it. Like they saw someone getting murdered. For god sake there are better things to be worried about  Mr. StayPolite by example: stop bitching around, and have a nice day :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:30:37
Did the FBI got any bitcoins seized?
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:39:38
Interesting. Thanks for sharing. So this guy didn't know back in 2000 that Satoshi would come with "Bitcoin"? It's confusing because the domain is from the year 2000.
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:50:08
Holland rocks!
@_date: 2014-12-05 08:25:16
Yeah.. That's a shame. Just like Karpeles riding his cat.

We are ONE BROTHERHOOD, we are LEGION, we are Bitcoin believers. We don't forget. Expect us!
@_date: 2014-08-18 19:40:36
Yes, that's true. This fixed fee amount needs to warn users if they type in big amounts by mistake. But like always I ten-double-check payments done with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:27:46
Timelapse? It's still on 0BTC. LOL.
@_date: 2014-06-27 08:22:29
Nice that you got your coins back :) One question did you use also 2fa on your wallets via Blockchain.info or any extra second password for sending coins thru Blockchain.info?
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:44:06
Yea. I hope this person takes care of it. Unless if he is rich and doesn't mind..
@_date: 2014-10-15 06:52:23
That's messed up. That's why using Bitcoin is much cheaper and advantage. I think because you are purchasing something outside the US. That's why it's complicated for the Dutch seller here. He also needs to fill out some kind of paper and provide it for international shipping.
Bitcoin is still in the early stages. It's hard and difficult to encourage sellers to switch to Bitcoin thru Merchant services like BitPay, Coinbase or Bitonic.nl (has his own merchant service). 
Next time if you need something from the Netherlands ask me, maybe I can help you.
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:27:35
Buy low Sell High!

Use the following Twitter account style. It's nice and looking well. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 14:11:34
I know. But I use a second password for sending BTC and 2fa on my mobile device and I use a static IP I setup. So only on my IP I have acces to my wallet. I use Blockchain all the time. Never had any problems.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:17:48
I know.
@_date: 2014-10-17 12:57:59
You are right. Here in NL 2FA on Internet Banking is good secured.

Always and always use two-factor authentication and also for your email that is connected with Blockchain wallet. And to have more security enable a 2nd password for sending funds out of your wallet (Blockchain.info wallet). You can also choose for the option to only login on a specific static IP you can choose. Good luck next time!

I use Blockchain.info for generating my wallets and secure it good with all the extra security options thru Blockchain.info. By example 2fa and second password for sending coins and thru 1 static ip-address only. Am I safe enough?
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:59:44
Just waiting for Wall Street news. If they will invest bigtime in this cryptocurrency then Bitcoin will get more value overtime. Just wait and see if Secondmarket will be a succes in NY city soooon.. I think in Summer 2014 big price movements will happen!

Nice trailer! When you see these people talking.. It let's you think twice about it real. Bitcoin is awesome! 
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:19:03
Nice! Welcome to the Netherlands!
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:50:50
Interesting.. Is this the reason why the price of Bitcoin is dropping?
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:07:08
Man I hate that guy sooo much! Because of him I lost over 40+ coins in that EmptyGox!
@_date: 2014-10-15 15:00:55

@_date: 2014-09-20 22:08:52
Why not using Blockchain.info wallet for small transactions?
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:30:44
''The price of Bitcoin will rise above or equal $10,000 USD before November 29th, 2014. Price to be taken from MtGox or BitStamp as per bitcoincharts''
Yea right... EmptyGOX!...

Hashing power down!
@_date: 2014-03-14 09:57:09
The same with me happened. I was months trying also to convince my dad about Bitcoin when it was $100 a coin. He also thought that bitcoin was a ponzi-scheme.. I did not listen to him and gave it a shot. I invested in buying some coins and building a mining rig. And all the hard work paid out.
@_date: 2014-09-23 20:46:26
I hope they go big time in prison and stay there getting assfucked every day in and out!
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:40:31
That's why it's the best oppurtunity to buy them now while they are still cheaper than 1000+$ back then in December 2013. If you believe in the technology then you should buy some and hodl!

Exactly 1 BTC can be cut in 8 digits (0.00000001 BTC). So there will be enough coins or a fraction of a coin for everyone on the planet :)
@_date: 2014-05-22 22:51:50

@_date: 2014-03-16 18:24:05
Perfect comment.
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:29:39
Why not using Blockchain app much better.
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:03:42
They are giving free bits away by the way.
@_date: 2014-03-13 10:24:38
"We recommend MtGox" 
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:33:50
That's why I hate FBI. They don't fucking leave you alone.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:46:34
That's no problem.
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:13:36

Good news. Welcome in the bitcoinworld :)
@_date: 2014-06-14 12:22:16
Excellent move BitFury!

@_date: 2014-07-18 16:22:37
Huge news!
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:57:16
I'm still suprised why this guy is not in jail or yet harmed?
@_date: 2014-12-11 08:23:03
@_date: 2014-03-15 09:03:23
Yes, change your wallets. Never make a picture of your private key.. That's why it's called "private".. Btw you are lucky the quality of the posted image is bad so no one can scan those QR-codes.
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:30:00
Yes. Don't trade BTC if you don't know the other person.. Better to deal in face-to-face transactions or use Escrow service :)
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:09:02
How much datastorage is needed to obtain the whole Blockchain of blocks up to date and running on the Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2014-05-09 10:48:52
But if you keep an eye on Blockchain.info you can see more big volume transactions like that over the last 24 hours.
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:30:29
The good old days!
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:17:42
Yes. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:43:31
No. This happened a few months ago also with a person. I thought also with LTC. The mining pool who mined that block paid the user back the wrong amount of fee used. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 08:00:58
retest 460$ soon..

@_date: 2014-11-06 18:49:47
That is for sure that we should leave this guy alone. But it's weird why the media was at the first place when they were talking about Dorian Nakamoto and not about Nicholas Szabo..
@_date: 2014-10-23 11:46:45
LOL. Go fix MtGox first!
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:40:12

SR 2.0 paid all the members back right when it was hacked? How now? Thousand of members now are inthe same shit, right? All those coins gone probably seized by the FBI?
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:32:16
Coinbase is becoming a shitty company. People store your BTC on a offline wallet.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:15:37
I even didn't even accepted it.

Having problems Mr. The Italian Clit Licker..?
@_date: 2014-08-18 17:50:32
Can't the mining pool that mined this block pay the fees back to the user?
@_date: 2014-06-25 08:51:01
When will the GOXXING stop?!?!
@_date: 2014-11-05 08:24:34
Hmm.. My precious...! Thank you.. Precious...
@_date: 2014-10-17 06:59:21
That depends where you live. I would recommend Bitonic.nl or Anycoindirect.eu for EU country you can pay thru SEPA. 
Or have a look at Coinbase or Circle. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:25:29
LOL. Thanks chinese for letting BTC drop again..

I know but the highest level is 5. You can daily buy for 1,500 EUR and weekly 5000 EUR. Bitonic.nl is open for every amount. No restrictions whatsoever.
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:21:40
Yes. I know. But they started since September 2013. So not so long indeed but they are making good progress last time with marketing. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:14:48
It's interesting.

Is Trezor safe enough? By example: The MyTrezor Login page is down for a reason, how can somebody get acces to their wallet etc. I can't find information details about using Trezor advanced, on their website.

What's wrong with you m8?
@_date: 2014-06-20 11:19:34
How can you have 700.000 subs and just all of your videos have 500+ views? Fake subscribers?
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:25:10
So Nick Szabo is Satoshi...? Interesting.. For people who are interested they start talking about it on 15:00 minutes.
@_date: 2014-05-11 12:59:09
Haha Wolf of Wall Street.. Nice one!

Thanks for the information. I had a look at Armory, that is more advanced options but it gives you a good feeling for better security. I am hessitating because I have always used Blockchain.info wallet with 2FA and a 2nd password for sending funds. 
But with all these subs that I read that people get their bitcoins stolen from Blockchain.info wallet it gives me a creepy feeling.. What do you guys recommend?
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:57:47
But he is tipping, right? What's wrong with that?
@_date: 2014-05-11 12:36:49
Steam doesn't have to worry about the bitcoin price volatility they also can directly switch the amounts of bitcoins they have into US dollars, Euro or any kind of fiat-currency with Bitpay or Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-11-04 11:45:09
bitcoin = my precious.....
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:09:02
Haha. Nice one! 
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:48:52
This is nice! Now YouTubers can be tipped thru ChangeTip. Awesome!

Today I bought a Bitcoin T-shirt! Very excited to wear it soon for summer holiday!
@_date: 2014-07-01 12:52:32
Good news!
@_date: 2014-09-26 17:05:26
Where can I buy this watch?
@_date: 2014-03-14 10:28:22
That's also good man. I am happy for you. The early-adopters deserve this because they believed in bitcoin then and they still do now. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 20:13:46
Hell yes!
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:51:57

After 2 years when Charlie is a free man, Bitcoin will be in a next big fase.
@_date: 2014-04-15 05:30:21
Bitcoin is not yet supported in Tigerdirect.ca - but stay tuned!
Do you people even read?
@_date: 2014-10-14 20:08:09
Ah I see. That's nice. But can't I validate myself by sending €0,01 to your bankaccount like Bitonic.nl? That is much faster and secure in my eyes. Because you guys want an copy of my passport and proof of residence. That is much information and to much work and I don't like providing this much of information (privacy).
@_date: 2014-06-03 19:26:16
Mike Maloney is a smart man. I changed my view and oppinion about the FED etc and why Gold and Silver rules. Recommend to watch his educationel documentary's on his YouTube channel and not forget to subscribe and follow him on Twitter :)
Honest money = Bitcoin, gold and silver!
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:07:03
Yes, tipping.
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:23:43
Gimme some bits.. My precious..!
@_date: 2014-05-02 17:14:52
Great news!
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:08:55
The Netherlands also accept bitcoin payment as takeout:  
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:33:39
I signed the petition. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:01:41
Yes I wondering that also..
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:03:03
Miners should switch to other smaller pools. By example Eligius.st they also don't charge any fees.
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:23:49
Nice. Huge news!
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:04:54
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:05:22
You should also teach her how to use and mostly protect her bitcoins from getting stolen or lost - very important!
(or is she using the ''merchant'' option from BitPay or Coinbase?)
@_date: 2014-11-07 23:24:19
Bitcoin.. Hmm.. My precious..!
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:53:21
Amazon is lying many people and customers wants to pay with bitcoin but they don't seems to support it.
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:42:14
Thanks I will take a look at it.
@_date: 2014-08-31 14:20:10
Mark fucking Karpeles
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:02:32
Good to have you in bitcoin. But isn't it better to place a ''bitcoin accepted here'' logo on the homepage so people will directly see you accept payment in bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:59:05
I wish I could tell you how to tip but I don't know. Because I tip thru Twitter. Here's a link how to tip thru Reddit: 
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:57:04
@_date: 2014-08-17 19:28:08
I like that. So overtime more competition in the mining industry means higher difficulty and so raise of the value of 1 bitcoin mined?
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:44:15
Why not? Bitcoin is always open for change and improvement.
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:46:45
I am BitcoinNL :)
@_date: 2014-05-12 06:33:46

@_date: 2014-05-18 18:34:17
Nice! 
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:01:35
Yes, it is. You should send an email to: support
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:37:45
The same here. I also am awaiting for credits. Anyone else here received yet some credits?
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:49:54
Very nice! 
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:29:46
And what if the seller send the merchandise and the buyer doesn't give him the ecrypted password? Same shit happens..
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:57:46
Here in the NL weekly more and more shops in Arnhem are accepting Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:34:01
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:13:32
Is Bitcoin soon dead?
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:19:55
Maybe.. A year ago they won from Barca in Amsterdam but Messi was not playing.
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:15:48

My precious.. I love my precious... :-)
@_date: 2014-08-18 07:19:07
Hi. It's bitcoin not 'bit coin'
@_date: 2014-10-23 17:52:25
LOL. It's confusing for other trolls like you. Newbies that want to learn more about Bitcoin I meant. Because there are now 2 logos on the window.
@_date: 2014-05-05 09:24:41
That's a great idea!
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:39:55
I don't have problems with that. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:31:41
All those precious!
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:46:43
The problem is that there are restrictions. You can't buy big amounts BTC. Because you need to level yourself up thru buying levels. Not handy for a bitcoin trader at all.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:26:04
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:58:24
This is great!
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:18:41
Do you also live in NL?
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:00:18
To the moon!
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:19:15
About 10-15€. I am tipping thru Twitter.
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:14:17
But they don't have a friendly interface..
@_date: 2014-07-06 22:03:33
Haha, yes he does.
@_date: 2014-10-08 14:31:08
Is this real?
@_date: 2014-10-16 16:42:28
Thank god it's not a real one.
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:22:48
SecondMarket is going to launch in the summer this year. So it's then waiting to see the Wall Street guys investing..

Many love from the NL!
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:16:51
It is confusing because there are now 2 different logos of Bitcoin..
@_date: 2014-06-15 18:26:45
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:41:06
Most of the younger people know about bitcoin, because they are often online and hear from fellow friends what bitcoins are. Not only bitcoin but everything that is or going to be a trend.
@_date: 2014-10-31 20:15:05
Very nice interface. Makes it look more pro!
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:08:21
Yep. Delete the EmptyGox charts!
@_date: 2014-10-08 16:47:45
Yes. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:09:56
Snoop Doggie Dog I Always send him a ChangeTip but he never accepted it until today! 
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:05:27
Here the same! :)
@_date: 2014-03-20 17:51:26
So now GOX can pay some of their customers back? 
@_date: 2014-09-19 09:24:32
From mistakes you learn. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 12:38:49
Hmmm.. I would like to taste that bitcoin cupcakes and pay with bitcoin for it!
@_date: 2014-09-03 15:31:20

@_date: 2014-10-08 19:53:43
I get the following error: Error 1006 Acces Denied. The owner of this website (blockchain.info) has banned your IP address.
Why? I was even not on the website today.
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:27:41
411$!!! Precious!
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:36:24
Good. Thanks for your answer. I was thinking to bet with a small amount first.
@_date: 2014-10-18 11:51:55
Good luck.

@_date: 2014-04-12 07:28:20
Congrats and welcome into Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:23:08
The miners will be earning from transaction fees. I personnaly think in that time big companies will take over the mining industry.
@_date: 2014-11-06 10:15:37
What about these ones: 
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:53:25
Oh.. Like that way :). 
No it didn't work. But I appreciate it :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:18:17
Yeah!

@_date: 2014-11-05 19:43:03
Because I use Unibet. And Cloudbet has the same interface.
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:09:36
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:00:54
I buy daily, weekly and monthly bitcoins. If everyone does this in no time the price and popularity about Bitcoin will go faster I think..
@_date: 2014-10-09 09:46:08
Also explain that paying with bitcoin is easy and fast for micro-transactions and much cheaper than thru creditcards etc. Good luck tomorrow and have fun!
@_date: 2014-09-23 20:57:23
Backing up the .wallet file would be enough. Why using MultiBit wallet? Why don't use better and safer wallets like Blockchain.info or offline paper wallets.
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:53:17
@_date: 2014-12-19 11:46:20
I read if the Trezor got lost or broken you need to buy a new one and then you are able to recover the wallet... 
Is this true? That sounds expensive.. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 12:19:22
yes... very rough.. please donate some coins to me *sarcasm on 10.000%*
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:01:27
Bitcoin is mainstream. Doge is JUST A MEME.
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:08:39
I a always wanted to know: how secure is Bitcoin protocol itself? So how secure is 256 bits encryption. Didn't the NSA designed 256 bits of encryption.. Is there any backdoor? 
What is the best way to secure your bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:34:04
Yep. I always order and use bits.
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:38:53

Hi. I did a research on YouTube and some of them are accepting Bitcoin donations or tips. Like this channel about UFO SIGHTINGS ~ 
Unfortunately nobody has tipped him yet.. He has over 3,400 active subscribers.. I think Bitcoin is not so popular at YouTube..
You can find the QR CODES on their uploaded videos and the end of the video, or in description box.
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:18:22
Yes, it gives you the truth behind the dollar scams and fraud. I would say ''history is repeating and we need to learn from the mistaces''. Invest in Bitcoin, Gold and Silver before it's late.
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:22:57
BTC-e is better because they use automatic trading.
@_date: 2014-08-08 09:57:56

@_date: 2014-06-02 20:36:14
Haha Bitcoin rules day-in and day-out.. ALL THE TIME!
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:14:47

Imagine speaking to the innovation teams of one of the largest Dutch banks. Discovering none of the 20+ attendees understand bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:21:40
Do you have a public walletadress where you send the Bitcoins to?

@_date: 2014-12-19 12:35:08
Sounds interesting then. I might maybe go for a Trezor. Becuase it's safe, secure and easy to use like Blockchain.info wallet, but with more security, right?
@_date: 2014-09-20 21:57:03
Nice job!
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:52:36

Bitcoin can not be destroid anymore, even not by China. This digital currency is the future and day after day more and more people will get educated about the bitcoin protocol and right now there are over 43 million GH/s mining power on the bitcoin network. 
If China bans Bitcoin like they did many times before.. and dump these bitcoin prices again.. who matters? The ones who believe in the cryptocurrency will buy it back in cheaper. In my opinnion the price for 1 BTC will never get lower than 300$ period.
@_date: 2015-05-10 13:29:06
What is this problem? Can someone simply explain why a higher block size is bad or good? Thanks!

At this moment it's still affordable.. but 10K... Nah..
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:03:36
Don't get scared. You should always buy the dip. Not the highs especially not during this concern times. You will do fine my friend in the long term. Keep on buying cheap coins and HODL till 2020 :-)

For newcomers just buy a fraction of a Bitcoin. I do that myself all the time small amounts like $50 or $100. And always make backups of your wallet and never leave your BTC on an exchange!

@_date: 2016-12-23 20:11:38
If you decide to buy for large amount, you should invest in a hardware wallet that runs offline -

According to "Nakamoto" if the new fork goes in then Bitcoin is considered a FAILED project.....
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:23:10
According to "Nakamoto" if the new fork goes in then it's considerd "Bitcoin" a failed project.. Is this true??

The most HORRIBLE website I have ever seen so far!
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:16:40
What happened to the price? And according to "Satoshi Nakamoto" Bitcoin is a failed project because od the new fork?

Thank you. Bu running a full node we can activate UASF? The power is not anymore with the miners? How much % is needed?
@_date: 2017-04-12 13:13:37
Whatever man. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:45:29
Don't worry. Your transaction can be found here: 
Currently, there are too many transactions unconfirmed.

Tell your aunt not to look and pay attention to the Altcoins. Just put them in cold storage until at least 2021 in a hardware wallet like Trezor.
@_date: 2017-04-29 21:36:50
Altcoins are in a bubble ATM, be careful what you do.

That's pretty good!

My man!
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:27:59
I do. Bitcoin will find it's way. But if you made a decent amount of money with your investment. You should consider liquidating some in fiat or gold. 
@_date: 2017-04-26 13:24:25
Thank you, Vinny.

HODL your bitcoins and don't day trade. These ALTS are in a bubble.

@_date: 2017-04-27 23:59:11
@_date: 2017-04-23 17:26:54
No, you don't have to worry about that. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 16:03:11
People should use Bitstamp instead.
@_date: 2017-04-14 12:40:04
How can I run UASF node?

Bitcoin is been here since 2009-2017. Ponzi?
@_date: 2017-04-12 13:15:52
Why? Bitcoin works just fine now.

Almost $100+ price difference on Bitfinex compared to the Bitstamp exchange!
@_date: 2016-02-18 08:47:58

@_date: 2017-04-23 21:14:13
Looks very professional and cool!
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:19:20
And he's paying low fees.
@_date: 2016-02-27 18:16:42
Just use Trezor.
@_date: 2016-02-20 19:47:42
GREAT to see a discount code again from TREZOR.
@_date: 2017-04-23 17:17:53

When you spend it. Buy back!
@_date: 2017-04-17 13:37:32
They should change wallets.
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:43:28
I stopped using Blockchain.info. Very shitty company. IP ban every week once for no F*cking reason.. No support at all. And their wallet service is FULL of problems. 
I recommend a Hardware Wallet like Trezor. Works very great and you have 100% control on your PRIVATE KEYS (OFFLINE).
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:44:47
when will be the block-halving from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC?

@_date: 2015-04-18 15:01:53
True, but well spoken by William. We need more people talk daily about the Aspect and Technology behind Bitcoin.

我懷疑，大多數人正在哭泣最大塊大小和抨擊核心，是hodlers誰認為比特幣只能去月亮，如果它成為PayPal或VISA 2.0。
答對了。 而領先的收費是一些對比特幣有既得利益失敗的人。 市場表明它不工作。 忽略shitposts和歡喜。 價格攀登和技術指標看起來不錯！
@_date: 2016-10-28 17:49:34
Nice! I got in at around $100 and lost most of it in EmptyGox.
@_date: 2015-11-01 21:16:53
Roger did a great job explaining Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-16 14:18:57
When does he talk about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-10-16 18:05:08
@_date: 2016-10-28 15:44:16
MtGox... :(
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:50:23
Are any wallets compromised? That is why I always advice to use HW like Trezor!
@_date: 2015-11-10 14:04:53
Welcome to 'Bitcoin!'

@_date: 2016-10-28 15:53:18
Are you that "Guy"?
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:58:12
Or you can look at it the other way. You bought $200 in Bitcoin to pay for your laptop using Purse.io for the discount! I bought my Trezor 2 years ago for .50 BTC ($140 USD).
@_date: 2015-11-02 09:37:58
Yes. Roger did a great job explaining Bitcoin in a cool way.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:43:39
We need a meetup NOW with all Bitcoin developers and community out there! Let's make Bitcoin great again!
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:28:02
5% discount if you pay through Bitcoin ;-)
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:47:59
Buckle up, guys! 
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:34:34
In my perspective, I see BTC, LTC, and ETH good to hold. All the other 700+ cryptos will be dangerous to invest and hold on to.
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:42:57
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:20:24

Because it's the truth what came out his mouth and it's undeniable.
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:27:36
The safest way is a hardware wallet like Trezor.
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:15:59
Always buy the dip! 
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:57:36
I'll stick with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:08:16
Can't wait when it hits €2000
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:16:23
Misleading title. "Wants to pay everyone" No, it's not that. "Wants to let people EARN $1000 (in btc) a year".
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:38:36
Nice list.
@_date: 2016-10-11 09:54:53
Get them YOUNG.
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:20:54
Why are suddenly transactions not been confirmed?!

Lol. Since 2012 buyer and now getting out? You should have stopped in 2013. Pussy.

Nice one!
@_date: 2015-11-11 11:53:31
Just buy Bitcoins and don't worry about the price. See it as a long term investment. Trust me a couple of years later you will thank me. Mark my words. "Remind" this post :)

2000 and buy back in 1500.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:40:32
We are all Satoshi. But we should work together like back in the days 2012/2013/2014 as a strong community. I miss the good old days.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:28:45
This is not like 2013 at all. All the markets are skyrocketing even altcoins. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 12:02:53
I recommend using Trezor (Hardware Wallet).
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:48:09
Why does the REAL Satashi not sign a PGP like he did when people thought Dorian was Satoshi? The REAL Satoshi is silent..
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:11:17
He would not do that because of the high fees currently haha
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:33:09
Congrats! U did the right thing and not traded into altcoins. Have fun living there! :-)
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:56:25
Since 2015 I think.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:01:13
Misleading title. That can be done with Bitcoin as well. You have to wait for the first transaction confirmation.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:52:57
We need SegWit or bigger blocks. This is killing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-28 12:25:40
Buy TREZOR!
@_date: 2015-10-22 20:36:44

Try this: 
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:27:35
But 50% of that is being pumped it altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:37:39
Just 2 years ago. Felt like yesterday.

It doesn't work on the Mac.

I'll wake u up.
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:22:27
Just do something! Sticking at 1mb blocks for years not good.
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:05:08
Feels like a scam, watch out.
@_date: 2017-05-01 05:24:32
Yes.

Kind off tired of the altcoins. Why are they pumping? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:27:38
That's a good technique for long time investing and holding.
@_date: 2017-05-08 16:46:03
Mostly is in ALTCOINS &gt; Poloniex.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:49:11
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:39:15
Why is the altcoins price skyrocketing? Why is the dominance declining? Why don't we have SegWit yet or bigger blocks?

Coinbase or Gemini.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:11:17
What's going on with altcoins?!
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:29:30
You should definitely go with Trezor Hardware Wallet. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 06:51:19
"This is BITCOIN" !!!

Day traders are definitely having the hung-over feeling.

Bitcoin is Financial-Freedom.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:08:57
Hold on your bitcoins and don't go trade them for altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:03:53
No, the blocks are full.
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:06:31
Just pay a higher fee? Is that how you want to bring Bitcoin mainstream?
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:11:22
May 15th.

Okay, have fun spending your LTC with a couple of merchants.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:33:31
Even worse than banks. With a Bank account, you don't pay transaction fees for every single transaction. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:36:08
@_date: 2017-05-08 20:54:59
I think Bitcoin is here to stay just like the altcoins. Bitcoin is like digital gold.  
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:30:10
Means the percentage of the total volume in bitcoins are going into other coins such as ETH, LTC, and XRP. You can see it as a cut of the 24h volume.
@_date: 2017-05-11 12:30:42
That's why we need a protocol upgrade to SegWit or bigger blocks NOW!
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:38:16
Very interesting!
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:23:28
No bubble, what about the altcoins?

@_date: 2017-05-06 19:04:21
That's the stupidest answer to give. Altcoins seriously? Ain't you a Bitcoiner?
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:42:13
Haha, you made my day!
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:32:12
Well said.

I don't know about that. It's been hovering for weeks now at 100 USD range. The masternode holders are not selling.
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:11:07
Are Chinese problems on exchanges fixed yet?
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:24:10
It will recover.
