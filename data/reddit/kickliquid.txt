Buffett's opinions are relevant.... when it pertains to things he actually knows, like value investing and compounding. It's what made him the 4th richest man in the world as of the new year.
but when it comes to Technology and Cryptocurrency I don't even see why his opinions are relevant.

The only free lunch is diversification.
Unfortunately, yes as of right now fiat currency and traditional banking is the most current system but I don't put 100% of my faith into them, I have several bank accounts, several brokerages, several crypto exchanges and several hardware wallets, several precious metals, and several physical properties. I even own firearms as an asset because believe it or not that is a form of insurance against the uncertainty for any of these systems.
