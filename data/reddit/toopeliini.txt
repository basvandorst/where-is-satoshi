Feel you.
Got scammed today for +100 btcp and some changes of other coins by HitBTC after year of trading on the platform. What the hell are these requirements?
So yeah, I have to go and get new passport or officially stamped translations of my driver's licence (for god's sake, from where they suppose I get that!!?) and electricity bill. Wow, that must be cheap task to do. 
And they need my social media accounts too, for what!!? To sell my identity to someone?
And propably the next step (or roadblock if you will) would be to provide all my btc/btcp transfers to them "to show origin of funds" which is near to impossible task too if you have ever done more trading and transfers than just buying BTC from coinbase to a one single address or used privacy features of a coin.
I've filled hundreds of KYC's in my life no problem including many exchanges, but this is the one that **I just can't do**.
And yet they reveal nothing from themselves. Absolutely nothing. And still I'm asked to go through this.
Well they just "earned" another 100btcp for making it literally impossible to fill this so called "KYC". Glad I got most of my money out before this.
Nothing but a bunch of low life thieves. Stay Away from HitBTC if you already aren't!
