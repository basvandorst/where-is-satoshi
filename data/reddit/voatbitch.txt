These ass holes just removed my comment asking for anti xt pools.  Can't wait till Reddit fully dies and stopps kicking.  Fuck you mods.... Really. Fuck you

@_date: 2015-08-16 20:03:53

Hi there! I like your site and I actually tried to use it but i failed. Maybe you can help me. 
I save the page on to my desktop. Beside the HTML file, I also get this folder called Bitcoin Paper Wallet Generator_files.  I open the folder and edit the file: front-300dpi-custom.jpg (basically added a couple of images on top of the .jpg using the image editor in mac. Then I [Save the file and then l click on the html.](  
After it launches, click on custom on the drop down menu [and then i see this:](
Thanks for your help. 
 
EDIT: nvm. i had to put the front-300dpi-custom.jpg on a folder on my desktop called images. It was a bit confusing. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 16:44:59

When a hard fork is needed to fix an **imminent**  problem, a fork will happen as fast as a few days max. You know why? Because we will all be in consensus unlike now.  
@_date: 2015-08-15 19:21:26
You can use this one on that same site under custom. 
What don't you like about it ?
@_date: 2015-08-13 17:21:45
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:48:21
