I did and there is plenty of information, but it’s only the federal requirements. I can be federally compliant, but not state. There isn’t any information on crypto in my state law.

Some people are not intellectually capable of the responsibility to manage private keys. Coinbase facilitates this. I've converted many people to bitcoin because of Coinbase; without them it just wouldn't have happened. I think it's about the "option" to take on the responsibly that makes bitcoin interesting. With fiat this option isn't available. I think Coinbase is an amazing company we owe much of bitcoin's adoption to.

I'll take any TP you don't want. You know... Because littering is bad.
@_date: 2014-03-16 04:57:03
You could take a screenshot of your Coinbase QR address and give it a fancy frame with your businesses' name or something.
After that download the app ZeroBlock. It has a great USD to BTC convertor that goes off the BitStamp price, which is usually the same as Coinbase.
Now you're all set. Ring up the customer the conventional way and input the total in USD into ZeroBlock to get the current Bitcoin equivalent . Have the costumer pay that amount to your fancy Coinbase QR code photo on your iPad. 
You could even setup your Coinbase account to automatically exchange funds to local currency upon payment for zero risk of exchange volatility.

For me it's about value creation. I believe the price is going lower, so I'm not buying to lose value. If I'm not buying there must be others doing the same. Subsequently, I think there's a lot of people who bought in around these prices and can ether buy more at lower prices to hedge the ones they purchased at higher prices or sell and cut losses to buy another day. Most of us can't afford the risk in buying lower to hedge the higher purchased coins so we settle for the latter. I believe this is lowering the price bracket for this scenario thus applying pressure  to the next group of early buyers. No one wants to lose value obviously. We  will watch closely and buy at the lowest price. Just watch outside the Bitcoin world. Something will snap, economies will crash, Bitcoin will moon. Buy at the snap and you won't regret it.

I would think with Bitcoin and sidechains it's more of an all or none type network. It would be more difficult in the future for corporations to fight net neutrality if their network and infrastructure were dependent on it. To me it seems by separating the chains someday when net neutrality is challenged harder it wouldn't be difficult to continue business as usually for corps, govs, etc. The original Ethereum chain needs net neutrality to work. Bitcoin demands it. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:15:46
Is that really true though? I can't choose to host a small portion of the blockchain. It's all or nothing. I do believe I could control the bandwidth used though.
@_date: 2016-03-02 22:36:04
The original chain isn't necessary to operate the new chains. The big point here that most Ethereum investors do not yet understand is this model will eventually cause the original Ethereum blockchain to become irrelevant and the Ether on it worthless. Governments will not be able to regulate what the original chain is used for, but they will be able to regulate what blockchains a company’s blockchain can legally interact with. Overtime there will be more regulation towards centralization. You’ll end up with government and bank owned master chains that companies will, by law, be forced to interact with.

All the companies will choose traditional law every day of the week. Because, the money they use is issued from it. I think the only reason I would get excited is if companies started collecting "not converting" decentralized monetary tokens.

@_date: 2016-03-03 17:59:47
I think we know it's better, but companies and governments don't want decentralized control or safeguards; they want all control. It's as if we're giving them a powerful weapon and saying do good with this.
I think if a large company openly started selling legal products on the "Silk Road" or "Open Market software" government regulation would force them to stop. If the main Ethereum blockchain is being used for grey area activities government will force legit blockchains to stop or even worse use government ones instead.
We have to be to decentralized to fail and the truth is we're not even close.

What if my this new decentralized database offered many new upgrades? lower/no fees, anonymity features, instant confirmations, etc. and best of all? If you already had tokens you are automatically part of the currency. It wouldn't cost you anything to be involved.

I'm a resident in this area and replied: 
I appreciate your efforts to have a better understanding on technology, but mining Bitcoin is not an intrinsically cheaper way to acquire Bitcoin. It is an investment with risk. It’s cheaper over time if the value of Bitcoin goes up in conjunction with the mining difficulty going down or stabilizing. Because mining Bitcoin is an investment with risk, you’re gambling tax payer dollars for a higher monetary return. The better alternative is buying at Bitcoin’s market spot price from a Federally compliant exchange and utilizing anonymity techniques once the Bitcoin is purchased. Bitcoin can be anonymous, but mining it isn’t going to guarantee your anonymity. If you want your Bitcoins to be anonymous you’ll need to trade them on an exchange that does not require any identifying information such as Shapeshift.io while using TOR. Trade your Bitcoin for Zcash or Monero (since ”these cryptos have anonymity built in”) and then trade back into Bitcoin over multiple time-separated trades and receiving addresses. Ensure TOR issues you a new IP with each trade. I find it disturbing that a government entity wants to mine Bitcoin claiming that it is because they won’t be discovered or traced by criminals when it’s not difficult to anonymize Bitcoins. At best it’s incompetence and at worst a way to secretly profit from tax payers. Where’s the accountability of the mines’ profits? Is the mining operation subject to FinCEN regulation? AML rules? Is the law above the law? I’m excited the government is getting behind Bitcoin, but disappointed in the implementation. Please don’t mine and gamble tax payer dollars; buy and anonymize.

In this case you're using it to anonymize yourself not Shapeshift. You can just fire up TOR browser and navigate to shapeshift.io

Apple collects the GPS coordinates and router information of every access point iPhones access. 
If I connect my MacBook using a VPN to a router previously accessed by someone's iPhone my IP Address will state the location of the VPN, but Apple software "Maps" will reference   collected data and define my location as the physical location of the router.
Basically, TOR will only hide you from anyone Apple doesn't want to know.
