It will keep falling a lil bit.
The moment people in Europe are getting home from work they will sell.
Just wait till everyone sells that wanne sell and then buy more.

You just need to wait till all the plebs sold.
And how do you do that? Wait till everybody had the opportunity to sell.
The plebs in Inda and China sold since its evening there (everybody is home and acces to their pc). USA is waking up so in the following day there will be sold more then bought. And the people in Europe will get home from work after +- 3-5 hours, so there will an addition dip. I guess it will stabilize after 12 hours. I'm going to watch what happens in the following hours and then it will come clear if my predictions are right and if so, I will be buying more after a good 12 hours.

Mind you, people in Europe are coming home now so the plebs will sell between this and the next 5 hours. Then you have people in the USA that are at work and will sell the moment they come home. I would wait around 10 hours before buying in more. In India and China the plebs alrdy sold so we're over that part.

I understand. I'm just implying that the biggest fall is over when most of the chickens checked out, and that will be when everybody had the chance that wants to chicken out did.
