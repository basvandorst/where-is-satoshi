I understand bitcoin may solve many of those problems but did it solve any yet ? We are way too far away from having bitcoin solving those problems. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 17:41:54
Why dont we directly set the price to, lets say, 200,000? 
@_date: 2018-09-08 15:07:52
USD seems a better option to me. I will freakout only if rest of the world start sanctioning the US.  
@_date: 2018-09-08 15:10:25
Which problem did it solve ? 
@_date: 2018-08-10 05:52:23
Postponed due to multiple failed attempts. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 13:21:47
Thats extremely low standard. 
Expectations: Governments will be toppled, conventional banking system will go broke, gold will be worthless, dollar bills will be used in kiln and people will run after bitcoin.
Reality: A tv programme mentioned bitcoin and someone is celebrating. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 04:57:25
Thats a U Turn from so-called crypto enthusiasts. I thought you guys dont wanna regulations.

Use, probably, 25% of your fiat to enter now. If it continues to grow you may recover your loss even with that 25% investment and if it goes down you can buy more again.

What do you guys reckon will happen when we touch 10K ? FOMO or big sell off ?

Maybe a snapshot of future ? 
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:39:48
I agree. The FOMO is yet to come, I think it will kick in after we cross 10k. That will be quite a show. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:14:43

This could be true but the article should contain a link or reference to the actual research. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:25:44
Ok so what will happen when we touch 12K ? Final make or break ? 
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:43:30
Typical example of FUD and then FOMO. I could have probably done the same thing.

Anyone who thinks bitcoin/blockchain/crypto is going to solve the issues of failing economies is a moron. I would not mind having satoshis in my phone wallet and paying instantly for everything I buy but until that happens bitcoin is a pyramid scheme. We all are waiting for newbies to fall into this hole and stand onto their shoulders to get out/take profits. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:47:50

We went down from 9600 to 5900 amid all negative news in January/February and I remember facebook ban was a major news that time. We should see some positive uptrend. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:40:59
I am new to crypto and entered in January this year. But what I can say for sure is that it takes less than 2 weeks for sentiments to change and people start talking the opposite. You never know what people will be talking about in two weeks from now on.

@_date: 2018-03-21 13:28:31
You can look at it from another angle. People need bitcoin to start trading the ALTs. It does help bitcoin. Most of the trading in bitcoin is done by investors who are investing in ALTs.
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:58:27
It can go below 8800 in a blink of an eye.

Bull trap is when the price is slightly going up before a big dump, no ?

On a side note I am happy to see you are back. It was quite boring yesterday because of no trolls.

If you are lucky you may even get into a group of mini whales. They operate in great coordination. There will be a risk of getting rekt by your own team members if they send you a wrong signal which they could do. Need to be careful as to when to buy or sell. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:24:38
Bitcoin is like a pendulum, the more its being pulled on one side the higher it goes on the other side. So a big crash definitely means it will go much higher. We just dont know whether we are in the middle of a crash, whether it has passed or is it coming. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:25:44
Its strange that when a convict (IMF’s chief) says some bullshit the price drops, but a legitimate breakthrough like LND was unable to have any significant impact on the price. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:09:15
I wonder if whales are suited booted when they sit in front of their computers. I mean do they stay professional and tidy while doing pump and dump or just a random guy getting up and start dumping? What do they look like when doing a pump, I wonder. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:27:21
Good luck placing your argument based on what the fock McAfee said. Will you eat your own dick too ?

If you look at the negative news in last two days alone you will find at least 20 different stories which are anti-crypto, google banning crypto ads and IMF’s convicted chief’s shitslang being among the top stories. It didnt do much to the price seriously, I mean it was going 5-10% down anyway. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:55:47

Let me assure you with confidence that China is making big progress on blockchain technology. There is a lot of debate and excitement in China about internet of things. They have had manufactured various chip based small devices such as LED lights and they are backing companies working on IoT operating systems. China will benefit the most since they are the biggest manufacturers. Its just they dont allow speculative trading and government wants to keep control of the economy. ICOs and Crypto trading is dead in China but the technological developments are taking big leaps. We may see China back to crypto trading in near future.

Apart from predictions on BTC, the other hot topic in this sub is to remind others how long they are using reddit for. Seems like you got Masters in Reddit from Reddit Law College. Isnt everyone talking the same shit regardless of how long they are using reddit for ? I am redditer for 21 days.

Oh wait, what ?
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:55:33
China always uses Hong Kong for doing things they cant do in mainland China. Hong Kong is intentionally left as a flexible, independent financial state with lenient banking policies, free trade zones, and lower taxes etc. China always uses Hong Kong as an experiment before something is being introduced to mainland China. Believe it or not what happens in Hong Kong is Chinese state policy. China blocked crypto trading in mainland China but intentionally left it untouched in Hong Kong and its gonna stay. Hong Kong is not going to clampdown on its exchanges.

Edit: Jokes aside. I had lost serious amount of money (more than 60%) since I invested in Jan this year. Hopefully there is time in the future where we all are able to recover our lost money. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:11:55
Yes but dont know when
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:49:23
Everyone seems to be genius here. Why dont u all get real jobs and leave the crypto on its own? Have any of your previous predictions held true ? I am hearing about the resistance walls since BTC was at 12K. Stop using “I predict”, rather use “I wish” or “I hope”. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:16:19
I dont know how many times alt coins will be slaughtered before they go up. If Bitcoin goes up they go up slowly, bitcoin goes down they run down faster then anything on earth. It has become so predictable now. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:34:25
Lol, now tell me you bought bitcoin when it was 13 dollars and bla bla bla. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:15:36
Your alt coin has to be extremely lucky for an organic growth if its not in top 20.

Or it is just waiting for another reason to go down. I mean there is no very bad news for a few days now and thats probably what is keeping the price up.

Never think that once we start to go up there is no risk to get back from midway. This thing may very well bounce off the bottom, skyrocket and come back earlier and harder than most have imagined.

Please ask me how much bitcoin will be worth at a particular time in the future. I almost completed my two weeks course on reddit.
PS: Currently I am only qualified to make predictions into next 20 years (until 31 march 2038). If you want predictions beyond 2038 I will have to ask my guru reddit.

Would you sell if you reach your target of 20K, for example, or would you hold on just because someone else has a target of 25K and you wanna help them ? People have set their limits and they sell when their limit reaches. You cant blame them and cant rely on them to hold.

By the and of month: 4400-13333

Shaddy businesses such as this one are always protected and hong kong is the place for them. Dont believe what you see in news. Exchanges might “expand” to europe but not “move” there completely. Why would they move to europe if bitfinex has to declare 2.3B USD. Hong Kong is the place for them to stay and get away with.

The trade volume on coinmarketcap is only 3% (4.5B) of bitcoin s market value (130B). Not much trade is happening. This could mean two things
1- its the bottom and sellers are not willing to sell further down.
2- buyers are not interested to buy at all.
In either case, its not a good thing.

Many investors buying at a certain price are willing to give it up with a few hundred dollars loss, so there will always be weak hands. Plus only 3-4% of bitcoins are being actively traded in the market so there will always be more coins coming out of stock. 
But one can definitely hope.

Hopefully 8k by next weekend. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 05:02:27
If bitcoin drops 5% alts drop like 20% and if bitcoin gains 5% either alts gain like 20% or not at all. There is, of course, lot of bot trading and manipulation. Plus almost all the alts dont increase in value even if there are developments or positive news (main net launch, new exchange launch etc) during a bearish market. On the other hand small news, like CEO took a shit, significantly increases the value of alts.

Yes many people FUD, but the logic that USD or stock exchange crash would automatically help bitcoin is not entirely true. During wars and uncertain times people find refuge in gold and metals. May take few decades for bitcoin to replace that.

Asking questions here is also a part of research. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 03:54:50
People are simply anticipating a bullrun and converting to BTC. Shitcoins or whatever you call them are slightly slower to recover so people will buy back at a later stage.

Type of people on this subreddit.
1- authentic- those who dont give a shit about tech but  are here for money (I am the one) and openly accept it.
2- hypocrites- those who claim to be in it for tech but actually cry over each penny they lose.
3- non-coiners- with pathetic life, who still live with their moms, some of them even with their grandparents, because their parents kicked them out.
4- those who feel good just by making bold predictions (a sub-class of No.3)
5- FUDs, which seems to be most successful group so far. 
 
Edit: Another group who tell you that you are a redditer for two weeks and have no right to say anything. Like they spent whole childhood on reddit. Fuckers

Below is a copy of my comment I made on another sub. This is relevant.
“Anyone else speculating on what will happen if and when China launches its own “cryptocurrency”. Here is my take.
1- First of all its almost official that they had been working on to develop a cryptocurrency for years now, so lets not ignore it by simply calling it a speculation.  The deputy chief of payments of PBoC confirmed in a recent event that its almost time to roll it out.
2- Term “Cryptocurrency” is a misnomer in this case. It definitely has something to do with blockchain but not in its entirety. They (Chinese officials) argue that blockchain simply cant support the sheer retail volume of transactions they are expecting. “Digital currency” is a better name.
3- Both PBoC and retail banks will be involved in a “two tier” system.
4- Two of the most important and most censored/controlled payment gateways, Alipay from Alibaba and Tenpay from Tencent (parent company of wechat) are already onboard. I assume these payment gateways will be used to move fiat in and out.
5- The single most important reason to launch such a digital currency could be to compete with Bitcoin or decentralization in general, and draw peoples’ attention away.
6- The 2nd reason could be to stay in the game and not fall too short behind if digitalization and cryptocurrencies become an important part of the world economy in the future.
7- 3rd reason could be to allow blockchain based innovations to stay afloat in China.
8- There are speculations in Chinese crypto groups about the launch of an “official crypto exchange” too and I wont be surprised if they randomly choose 10 Chinese shitcoins and allow their trading against the official digital currency.
So the launch if Chinese digital coin could be a more important event than many are expecting. So far official digital currencies came from the likes of  Venezuela and failed completely but China is different”.

Serious topic: Human Greed
How many people, who entered earlier than average joe, actually took their profits and have left crypto? I think not many. They are waiting on the sidelines for a suitable time. Most of the fiat which have entered into crypto until now is still there in some form. Human greed is bigger than any incentive.

Just because alt coins are in green on coinmarketcap does not mean they are going up. They are only up as compared to 24 hours ago but overall pretty much fucked up. Doing much worse than bitcoin indeed. 
But I agree with you that there is too much market manipulation and I dont know how long it will take before bitcoins are evenly distributed and a single person or group can not manipulate the price.

I encourage everyone to buy quilts for next winter, from wunderbaah’s mom’s favourite quilt store in unionville IA and pay bitcoins. On the way to the store you will see a supermarket where you can buy some weekend grocery and on the way back you will see 3 coffee shops. Have a cup of coffee of your own like, all paid by btc. And yes dont forget to convince the owner of town’s only sex toy shop to start accepting butcoins.

I dont know whats wrong with the post. 5 bitcoins mined when most of the people didnt even hear about bitcoin so you must be a very early miner/aware of bitcoins.
