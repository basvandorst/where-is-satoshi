Besides being patent happy douche-bags, in this setup exchanges still control the funds and can steal them.
What's up with the ridiculous claim of "World's Most Secure Bitcoin Wallet"
EDIT: ** exchanges should use Copay!**
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:45:28
So no direct verification of reserves? It's a pointless thing.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:00:48
Copay is completely not ready for prime time, but anyone that says that gets down voted.
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:05:33
If BitPay can use this, that means any exchange can too!  
Bonus, BitPay is not patent happy like *BitGo douche-bags*, or as they say 
@_date: 2015-06-03 13:37:16
Already submitted by you 1 hr ago.
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:28:49
Your company has no reputation, and it's pointless. The whole idea of bitcoin is to be trustless. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:31:58
Good guy BitPay, always doing good things for the community. Stop using Coinbase and use BitPay as your payment processor! 
@_date: 2015-06-07 21:07:33
Bullshit, they just had first movers advantage with really crap technology and not clue what they are doing. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:11:38
It's because unlike Coinbase and BitGo they are not SF douche bags.
@_date: 2015-06-07 17:52:28
Confidence meters are irresponsible, they don't work.
@_date: 2015-06-22 03:28:38
They have being making money from consulting, which probably wasn't enough. I think it will be only downhill from here.
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:28:51
Copay is not ready for prime time, and remember open source software has no warranties or official support.
@_date: 2015-06-02 22:18:11
If without this "Snap", when I pay on Purse.io the bitcoins are going to an Coinbase wallet, I will immediately stop using this service.  Coinbase will track the received bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-06-06 13:05:21
TC is a joke, seriously who reads this crap. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:17:08
Although cool Copay is ultra buggy, not ready for prime time.
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:27:28
Stop using this shit, delete the bookmark, don't mention to friends, don't post on reddit. 
Make it disappear.
@_date: 2015-06-03 13:24:12
Piss off patent happy douchebags. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:51:14
Account is brand new. 
This is more Copay shilling, it's being happening to all wallets since their launch.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:54:12
We should all boycott them until they do.
@_date: 2015-06-04 14:39:02
Xapo isn't even luke-warm, more PR crap.
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:22:13
Why don't you just sell the bitcoin on Bitstamp wire back? At least they will be tracking you on bulk not each transaction. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 00:03:07
Neither have P2SH support.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:56:19
That's what you get for using ShitGo as your backend.
@_date: 2014-10-17 02:09:18
Spot on, who gives a shit.
If you read this wave, then go home.
@_date: 2014-12-14 19:44:18
Great round up, all the single key apps should not be user for more than daily spending!
@_date: 2015-05-22 02:41:14
It bothers me they don't use secure chips, that's why I prefer Ledger's even though they don't have a screen. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:58:14
Your point is great, but multisig is not new, many other companies already offer.
**Coinbase DID NOT CREATE MULTISIG.** 
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:16:16
Seems like Ad for some, what was the specs for choosing the wallets reviewed?
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:02:03
One you own the private keys. 
Electrum, Mycelium, Breadwallet are some examples.
@_date: 2015-05-27 14:23:23
Don't use armory, it's over engineering and over complication will cause you to lose money by human error. They created a complicated product to make money on consulting fees.
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:25:23
Maybe the community is just tired of coinbase updates, I am.
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:40:30
That is not what their marketing to the mainstream say.
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:06:56
So you are claiming that is a shortcut in security? 
You are a joke, with respect, nice that you created a product that requires you consulting services.
@_date: 2015-05-13 22:38:37
Bugs, Patents, Bad Privacy, all around ex-Facebook douchebags. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:42:10
BitcoinJS has a good history.
@_date: 2015-05-13 22:24:05
What's wrong with these guys, don't they understand the basics of privacy?
The majority of people don't find it cute to have their picture and info shared with every transaction.
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:19:43
This is stupid, there is no need. They get a call back from toshi when the payment was made. This is blatant tracking attempt.
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:55:29
NO. Toshi gives them a call back of when the payment hit the blockchain. There is no need for cookies, even bitpay works without cookies.
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:55:38
They are probably sharing the link internally and getting caught as a voting ring. Or even if they are not, the usual people keep up-voting them. Proof is that the thread had 13 up-votes in less than 1 min very unlikely to a subreddit this small.
@_date: 2015-05-18 14:30:33
So many red flags:
1. No founder information
2. Not open source
3. No information about how they handle the 3rd key
4. Spelling mistakes everywhere
5. No info about the crypto engines
I don't understand why with so many good wallets already, someone would waste time building something so unremarkable.
Put your energy in more interesting project that don't have a saturated market.
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:44:14
Use something else, Coinbase is a piece of shit. The community really dislike them.
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:25:33
Funny, how many XRPs do you own? All you are saying can be done without ripple and WU will go away soon by the hands of Abra and apps like that.
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:41:42
That's not true, just google around, there are plenty who were locked out for very nuanced/indirect contact with anything they deemed of risk.
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:00:08
You can do that with web sockets, which I think you are already using. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 12:51:05
Oppressive government with an Oppressive wallet, match made in heaven. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:03:57
Authy is a terrible way of outsourcing security. They were hacked just a few months ago.
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:47:37
I think it's the opposite, they tried to vote manipulate and got the bot treatment from reddit. Also, the community is sick of coinbase privacy problems.
@_date: 2015-05-13 23:03:59
People get confused about (Bitcoin ≠ Bank = Coibase = PayPal)
Here is the issue in 4 easy steps:
1. Person hears about bitcoin being amazing and having privacy
2. Person googles bitcoin and gets to coinbase
3. Person thinks coinbase is bitcoin, because coinbase doesn't make a point of explaining
4. Person comes to r/Bitcoin to complain when finds out about the BS
It's not the persons fault. Coinabse should do a better job at explaining it's a bank and not bitcoin or it will have it's reputation get even worst around here.
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:18:26
It would probably be the ex-facebook patent happy bitgo people first.
@_date: 2015-05-18 13:34:10
Stop spamming, this story has been submitted 10 times.
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:41:28
Armory is crap for usability, people are more likely to lose their money trying to use than by getting robbed. 
Op should just get a couple Ledger Hardware wallet and keep somewhere safe.
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:50:34
Don't use either as a wallet, they offer no real bitcoin wallet and track you. 
Buy on Circle then transfer out to a real wallet
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:08:06
Well then use GreenAddress
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:57:01
Maybe they should quite saying that they are a Bitcoin company and say they are like Bank, then no disappointment and trashing them back will stop.
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:45:59
I'd say yes, but I can't support companies that do business with bitgo
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:43:50
You smell like scam.
@_date: 2015-05-20 18:50:08
Maybe your bosses would like to patent a new option?
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:41:54
Nice update, but use it with caution. 
**All your transactions are tracked on Coinbase bank.**
- 
- 
- 
- Just search for more examples...
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:38:49
Amateurs, at least get your own number. Please don't trust your coins with this services.
@_date: 2015-05-04 12:33:21
They screwed up badly many many times 
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:35:30
There is something weird going on &gt;.&lt;
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:24:49
Here you go 
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:31:19
Use ledger, cheaper and better software.
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:21:12
**Bitcoin is Better with Privacy.**
@_date: 2015-05-13 23:20:20
Yes, we need a sticky:
Bitcoin ≠ Bank = Coibase = PayPal
Just that should do the trick.
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:19:51
Everything Xapos does is over exaggerated PR, expect nothing.
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:59:48
If many don't like them in this community, down votes are to be expected.
@_date: 2015-05-13 23:21:47
The onus is on your then. Why are you using coinbase as a wallet and expecting privacy? Buy there and keep it somewhere else.
@_date: 2015-05-15 15:31:49
Coinabse tracks all your transactions, I'd suggest Multisig-Signature in a different wallet like Electrum.
@_date: 2015-05-15 13:03:29
I can't support companies that use bitgo.
@_date: 2015-05-25 12:49:42
There is soooo much vote manipulation for this. Instagram picture of a vaporware product that's been in the making for over 3 years with no info. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 13:51:02
Breadwallet is good, but never keep more than "spending money" on phone wallets.
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:26:00
All I'm saying is, all this coinbase backlash is based on disappointment. If they were more clear of what they are and what they do, people wouldn't come here complaining everyday.

Go away patent happy ppl.
@_date: 2015-08-21 18:19:56
Bitcoin.org has terrible representation of wallets a lot of miss information and even though it's open source. They are biased and don't want to change how things are displayed. 
As a side note, are you part of the Electrum team?
@_date: 2015-08-24 21:45:47
You haven't being around long enough young grass hopper. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:17:51
Can your new social media person stop spamming? 
@_date: 2015-08-26 19:39:39
They've probably figure out there is no market for a expensive wallet exposed to a baseband chip.
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:14:28
They have zero influence, just because they proclaimed to be it doesn't make it so. Just blog spam.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:59:38
Oh really, and what is this?
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:37:29
This looks like they just share the same investor, some are not even major. 
Just shit marketing
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:37:16
I think a big reason, is many r/bitcoin subscribers are not "redditors" they only subscribe here because it's better than the forum, but are not interested in partaking in reddit culture (karma trains, and other just for fun things) 
@_date: 2015-08-28 16:27:38
I respect them for trying to build something. But It's a stupid architecture and expensive product that will go nowhere. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:04:53
It's just marketing and infuriating the self proclamation of "bitcoin major player" when the majority of transactions are p2p not using this centralized crap.
@_date: 2015-08-18 02:42:26
This company has a couple high profile customers, but wont last long. Shitty tech, made a bunch of mistakes, patents, etc...
And they also have transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-08-30 15:17:31
But BitPay is in Atlanta.
@_date: 2015-08-21 21:18:08
Seriously that's how you handle customers with a "Sigh..."? 
it's your fault the useability of your application is crap and users get confused.
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:15:22
Ha ha! Those basis points are what, you paying me?
And why don't you run a transparent company and make prices public, it's all hidden, even for users you need to signup before finding out. 
Just like the patents are _just defensive_ right?
You are a bunch of bozos, stop trying to look nice and just be honest with your evil business ways.
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:17:57
LOL, good luck with that. The patent troll solution only signs a message claiming they know and most exchanges only keep peanuts with them, it's just for marketing.
@_date: 2015-08-28 15:56:22
One of the examples is when they had a bug that screwed up fees for the transaction amount and lost 85 bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-28 23:13:44
I thought you were anti VC, what a load of marketing crap that was.
@_date: 2015-08-26 13:41:35
It's a toy, do your research.
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:21:57
@_date: 2015-08-14 03:37:19
This site is bias, has incomplete information and even though is open source no one can really suggest changes. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:17:03
Very funny, they claim to be, they can't even get fees right by losing client's money.
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:19:23
Stop using this shit site, fucked up wallet, fucked up explorer, amateur hour.
@_date: 2015-08-28 23:43:47
Nothing. Rassah was making proclamations of not taking VC money because they were evil. These bitcoin company CEOs are all a bunch of back paddling liars.  
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:58:37
Total bullshit numbers. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:10:45
I keep saying this, they are bias and don't want to change the way things are displayed. This should be a big spreadsheet of all of this wallets do, with no recommendations. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 18:05:33
Boycott for using patent troll service provider
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:56:18
No tolerance for shitty businesses, just because they are funded doesn't make them good.
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:44:11
One of them is also a future patent troll and half of them keep losing customers funds, it's pathetic. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:21:42
Nice, thanks for open sourcing it. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 06:19:15
They've being shilling here a lot lately wouldn't be surprised some moves ahead.
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:57:50
Stop patenting stuff maybe people will be more civil with you.
@_date: 2015-07-10 02:03:41
This is the most antisocial thing I've seen so far, will go nowhere.
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:25:21
I second this, attention seeker. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:02:07
That's very generous, but unrealistic. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 02:59:25
Very typical from the TRezor ppl to pull the rug under open source license. Get the community to help then close it to put their ads now.
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:54:29
Ledger is only 15
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:49:51
Remember the shady fake insurance they offer and the empty Swiss office.
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:01:25
Seriously, stop using amateur software. This is just in the same level as BCI. Try Electrum or something like it. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:33:09
Yes, but with the amount of wallets and looking at the commit history, I find it hard to believe anyone will maintain this for free (non Bitpay employee)
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:55:44
So Xapo's shills downvoted us [here]( to oblivion and never answered about the scammy   insurance Xapo claims to have. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:04:52
Oh Xapo, always getting caught over hyping things.
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:17:42
Well that's even worst, so they will reap the community contributions and make money from them?
Do you work for Bitpay?
@_date: 2015-08-21 01:53:01
More spam!
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:09:23
Not a buttcoiner, long on Bitcoin, own 2K of it, Bitcoin banks/IOUs like xapo need to die before people get hurt. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 11:46:21
This is meaningless, you are just trusting another third party to vouch for them. It's not bitcoin proof.
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:09:02
Just search. Also, there are lots of HD multisig wallets out there.
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:23:51
It's hard to see them going anywhere. Very amateur people working there.
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:04:31
Not surprised, Wences is really sketchy. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:44:47
Smells like another Bitgo fuckup.
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:35:18
Never replied about their insurance scam.
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:04:45
I've been saying this for a long time, this is a very technologically poor outfit making outlandishly claims like: "The World's Most Secure Bitcoin Wallet." 
They sold investors on the promises of proprietary multi-signature with patents. And offer a JavaScript solution, with homemade servers and no security experts.  
Remember when they sent the amount as miner's fees?
@_date: 2015-08-28 17:56:08
Case is also exposed to many issues, collusion between thirdkey solutions and them or even worst, because it has a base-band chip the carrier has direct access to memory.
@_date: 2015-08-27 01:02:12
I have you RES tagged as a bitpay/copay shill btw.
@_date: 2015-08-05 14:13:12
Yes, but I'm not going to endorse anyone.
@_date: 2015-07-10 00:44:54
Stop using BCI. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:55:28
Yes, and a bunch of less technical large investors/suckers. I wish this fake insure got more attention but their down-voting brigades are too big.
@_date: 2015-07-10 05:02:56
That's very desperate. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:54:20
Isn't it a bit sketchy how much they downvote brigade us and never answered any questions about insurance? 
It will be ugly when they run with the money. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:36:13
Gavin and Hearn, yes we need a bigger size, but not this way. 
This is what antisocial behavior does, creates FUD. 
STOP being a$$hi3$
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:19:37
Electrum is completely centralized SPV wallet, you have to really trust them.
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:09:43
Stop using Patented technology and go for tested open source software.
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:31:35
This is bullshit numbers, they probably have no more than a few hundred thousand users with funded wallets.
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:15:00
One of my biggest concerns is, I think Bipay will fold because Coinbase is eating their lunch. So no one will maintain this.
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:51:26
Probably because of their new service provider. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:18:03
- Browser based = WebRTC (no need for binary client)
- Federated = like IRC
- Maybe ID system like Tox.
I just dislike the idea of over complicating it just to say it uses "Blockchain Technology" to please VCs.
A huge part of it's success is to either attract a larger group because of lol-cats or import all content and current karma. People already have a lot of investment in Reddit.
@_date: 2015-07-02 11:52:02
Bitstamp keeps almost all their funds in cold storage with Xapo (another stupid company)
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:28:58

@_date: 2015-07-13 05:10:46

Look at the fine print, there is no underwriter it's essentially "self insurance".

I don't like him, but have to agree. XT is an alt, has no place here.
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:41:38
Copay is super buggy and doesn't have many features.
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:05:11
If you actually clicked on the link you would see that another user posted. If you search you will see the majority of users here can't stand Xapo. And if people here didn't agree with me this post would never have raised to the top. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 11:49:02
Stop using this company's services.
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:35:04
Sure, sure, then after I use your API you pull the rug just like twitter. 
Stay away from Coinbase
@_date: 2015-04-08 13:21:07
265 votes and 3 comments, no manipulation huh?
@_date: 2015-04-06 18:21:15
They also don't know how to do Bitcoin crypto correctly, great place to lose your money.

@_date: 2015-04-21 18:27:38
No, uniques are completly different than active. 
That means that's people visting the site (probably with 30% bounce rate) &gt; and even worse, only a few percent convert into activities &gt; then only a tiny tiny ammount are creators &gt; then only a smaller amount wants Bitcoin. 
This is exactly how to bullshit.

Have any info on their citizenship program? Great place to start a business!
@_date: 2015-09-01 12:58:47
The problem with ChangeTip is it's team, aside from the new core dev the rest are a bunch of amateurs that can't properly execute a pure marketing play. And Instead of making partnerships they just attack other apps out of panic, their social media manager person is dumb and pushes away many of their supporters.

Already submitted, please stop re-posting. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:25:49
Thanks, please update the post to include an explanation. People are thinking that Localbitcoins was hacked, and it wasn't. 
If only your CEO had half your balls.
@_date: 2015-04-14 05:19:30
Why do you force me to use Coinbase, there are much better options. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 20:22:23
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:18:41
They will lockout you out of your Bits. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:15:39
Interesting, but how do you handle your keys?
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:51:55
None of these answer my questions, it seems that you don't know what you are doing. Sorry, but simply using Bitcore, doesn't make your environment secure.
@_date: 2015-09-14 16:09:43
Sorry, but it's an over priced badly designed solution looking for a problem. The GSM module is the death of this project.
@_date: 2015-09-14 11:42:38
STOP SPAMMING! 10th time you post this here.
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:15:12
Bitpay has finally found some focus here. Instead of a bunch of open source side projects, here is a feature that adds to the bottom line and I actually need.
Glad to see you might still not be a total loss.  
@_date: 2015-04-14 15:16:51
I have a suggestion, how about you stay away from here? 
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:23:17
It`s insane they are getting away with it. 
@_date: 2015-09-17 03:01:27
Good luck.
- Coinbase loses money left-right-center to double spends, it has money to cover it and keep quiet. 
- Xapo's CEO is a scammer and offers fake insurance. 
- BitGo has lost funds by fucking up fee out put. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 18:07:16
Not shipping yet, linkbait
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:49:09
I see your point, these companies enrage me. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:05:39
No, the way I see it they let someone get access to signed DKIM and SPF headers. That means these pass all dmarc rules meaning the email got delivered rather than discarded as junkmail. Spam filters only partially rely on content. Also everybody needs to mark these messages as spam. Do your part and report this to your email provider if you received this. 
They fucked up, know it and are quiet waiting for it to go away.
@_date: 2015-04-07 04:32:16
Seriously? Who gives a shit or is surprised about companies doing this stuff.
Why are bitcoin publication so shitty?
@_date: 2015-09-01 14:53:36
Why are you breaking it down by Sponsor? You should be listing all of them.
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:55:12


@_date: 2015-04-21 18:42:41
Funny how Xapo is never at fault? 
@_date: 2015-04-21 19:36:54
They are allowed to do what ever they want, but if they come lie/spam here on reddit we will call them out.
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:03:30
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:45:07
I absolutely love bitcoin, personaly hold a lot of BTC. The problem is **Xapo/Coinbase ARE NOT BITCOIN, they are leeches.**
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:37:01
They were too busy making wallets no one asked for.
@_date: 2015-09-17 02:27:04
That's their internal shitty wallet, CoPay is garbage and they got hacked.
@_date: 2015-09-10 03:37:42
Hey, 2 bit too idiot. Fuck miner's when they are done, I will start mining at home again.
@_date: 2015-09-17 02:48:19
That's what just got them hacked.
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:13:30
Something weird is going on. 
What about the fact they impersonated news
@_date: 2015-03-31 21:12:17
Lack of growth, bugs, they are going under soon. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:39:05
Out of all the wallets in this space, why did you choose the most hated scammiest partner you could find?
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:04:18
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:31:31
Please Bitgo employees, stop spamming reddit.
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:52:04
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:52:51
I think they are folding for lack of growth, there are many better options.
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:18:13
Fuck grandma, she wont be using Bitcoin for a while.
Forgot to mention you are the CEO of AirBitz?
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:47:19
I was looking at your account, and **you have over 100 posts** anti-Coinkite. I have nothing for them, I just can't stand Coinbase and BitGo, as I don't like American Companies.
**Are you shilling for BitGo???**
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:11:34
Jesus, what a shitty article.
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:45:23
u/kinoshitajona is a Ninki shill, they are fucking with you.
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:21:02
I want to play!
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:29:08
So as expected Bitgo will be on the DEADPOOL soon, funny how they hijacked "Leading security... blablabla"
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:53:15
Another startup will bite the dust soon.
@_date: 2015-03-30 18:29:32
This is centralized crap, crypto doesn't need a consortium. And gem buying good will for lack of traction is funny.
@_date: 2015-03-21 15:59:47
They have very few users, I don't know anyone who uses their service. No one cares.
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:24:55
As much as the this conflict of interest is bothersome, I don't think we have to worry about ProTip never happening. As the idiots behind it run their own show and have their own conflicts of interest by advertising the shit out of it on their show.
@_date: 2015-03-26 17:35:57
Old news.
@_date: 2015-03-20 01:34:51
Did you copy the same photo as Xapos for your website? 
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:05:28
But there is something like 100 up votes here, in less than 15min, offcourse you will trigger auto down votes.
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:57:25
By the amount of votes, looks like reddit is punishing them for vote manipulation. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:17:54
Amen to Coinbase STOP spamming reddit. Their bots will come downvote you and me in, 3,2,1...
