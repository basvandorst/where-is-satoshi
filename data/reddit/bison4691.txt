Why Tether? You talked about bitconnect didn't you?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:44:30
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:05:41
I don't know how you do that but make sure to make several copies of that wallet.dat 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:59:53
if tether inflated bitcoin then every altcoin inflated bitcoin. people are just stupid and don't know anything about how our economy works. They can't even differ between Fiat and something with value
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:10:29
Doesn't tether have to "inflate" itself by "printing" tokens when the demand on tether is rising to keep it at the 1$ range?
So in theory if the demand is decreasing they have to buy them back to keep it up at a dollar as well. We will see if that happens
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:16:48
it most likely triggered bot's and stop losses as well
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:25:00
Yeah like 10% of the whole market cap was lost and the main crypto exchange was gone. BCC if you count at it's peak had like 0,5% of the whole market cap and no trading or anything else is affected by it. Thats a different story
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:06:53
I think it will correct down to 9k or lower in the next days and will slowly enter a bullmarket afterwards
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:46:45
No pain no gain. 100% their fault. They will learn from it
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:42:03
why not going into the casino putting everything on black a few times and if you win invest in crypto to maximize your winnings?
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:19:21
Hopefully a correction since it was needed
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:18:15
mtgox was a 100x bigger deal than the obvious bcc scam
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:17:46
I have never seen a group of people that is more uneducated than these tether fudders
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:57:41
It didn't even finish it's elliott wave. It will most likely go down to 7.5k-9k again
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:35:45
But they claim to have a tech or an idea behind it or even a brand. And usually what happens is that they sell shares so you can have a part of the tech/idea/brand. But here they sell coins that might at some point be used in their own little ecosystem to be spend on goods. So it is nothing other than money for their ecosystem. So basicly with every new coin that hits an exchange bitcoin gets inflated because everything is traded in this cryptoworld with btc pairs so btc has to rise to keep at least a bit of its buying power within than crypto ecosystem. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:27:18
There are people out there that think Tether is a fake dollar bill because it is worth 1 dollar
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:45:30
It's not about bitcoin in the firstcase. It's about blockchain. And believe me blockchain will be used everywhere
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:15:42
Thats no difference to any other altcoin saying they have a tech  and  then they make coins and sell them in their ico for btc. Its exactly the same since you are not buying shares. You are buying Coins with no rights or anything. You might just be able to use them in their own ecosystem so it is like money in the end.
So if you say Bitcoin is inflated by tether then you basicly say bitcoin is inflated by every single altcoin
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:09:42
for example yes
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:20:39
cancelling the asia economy contracts might be the biggest mistake in americas history. Would have liked to see chinas laughing face when they did that. They basicly gave all these countrys into the hands of China
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:55:42
if you are not a daytrader just hold
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:28:55
it's so easy to make money out of this. just exchange into fiat high and rebuy low
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:09:39
yes out of all coins. the market cap dropped by over 200 billion in that time. that only happens when money is pulled out of all coins
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:32:21
holy shit move out your funds that the "pulse will hit zero" pattern
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:50:04
it's more a cult than anything else. btc will always be the first one but thats it. it will never accomplish anything. it's like an old horse which trys to keep the pace with the new young guns but it will fail at some point
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:20:13
Yeah it's pretty easy. If Iota manages to achieve what their goals are they will be the clear 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:03:42
bch can't live without bitcoin atm as all other cryptos. The whole market is built around it. Most of the trading pairs etc. If you kill btv you kill crypto
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:59:38
if it goes towards the 11k a bear market is the most likely scenario
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:41:01
verge will be
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:59:38
smart people cash out into fiat at some point and reinvest in the dips
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:08:59
I do but you should never call out a person cause of his non native language
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:28:33
I use these waves to increase my positions in alts i hold
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:46:23
we are in 1998
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:25:49
they have to make back money. ez to sell and rebuy low with users btc
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:15:35
not sure. 80 billion within a short time sounds more like wall street if anything else. maybe even the fbi dumps their stolen coins who knows
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:23:22
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:14:51
marketcap decreasing by like 40 billion again. Whales/Wallstreet or whoever just cashing out again to make even more money of weakhands
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:00:14
total market cap just -80 billion dollars today. Big boys cashing out on the weak hands
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:06:46
you will never hit the perfect bottom. maybe it drops to 9k$ who knows but 11k isn't a bad pick with an 20k ath
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:59:30
well -80 billion in overal crypto marketcap today. so whoever it is....he/she/they is/are moying enourmes amounts out of the market
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:55:11
well i believe that there are a lot of cryptos out there with no usage of their coins at all. In the future btc as the oldest and the real useful tec alts will survive
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:09:19
It doesnt matter. All the coins are not crashing because others like ripple get pushed. Big boys just pull money out of the market and exchange it to FIAT
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:43:25
buy thousands of cigarettes and stuff like that if you really think the financial system will crash
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:36:50
most coins are exchanged in btc so if btc goes down their price falls
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:04:20
well imho btc will have trouble when there will be alt/usd or whatever pairs in the future and nor more alt/btc pairs
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:03:54
why fortune teller? These corrections happen so often. people are just greedy and think hmmm it could rise more and more and more and in the end they did't realise their position
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:50:05
depends on the country you are living in
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:06:39
i sold in the 20k range hoped into alts meanwhile then changed to fiat and then just wait out for a dip. I think btc will get another dip even lower but we will see
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:59:21
I am so happy there are so much noobs in crypto recently. It's so easy to make money of these fools
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:52:10
well trump ruins the whole economy of the states....I hope ver won't do the same to crypto
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:43:51
70 billion where put out of the whole market thats why. bounced back a bit now
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:32:11
Well I can just say what my grandparents told me (WWII). You were able to buy everything with cigarettes :D
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:02:59
The market cap crashed by 80 billion dollars today. It's not that they invest btc in other stuff. The money is pulled out of the market and most of it out of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:46:50
Btc will be overtaken by privacy coins. Face it. We will always be thankfull that btc was there to change the world. but  other coins will take the credit in the end
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:10
ok dann lass uns doch auf deutsch unterhalten
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:05:09
Then tell us why Fiat has value. There are way less goods than Fiat on earth....and the spread gets wider and wider
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:36:26
It will propably go down a bit more like to the mid 30s
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:52:51
well if you can almost double the money of of weakhands by pumping and dumping they will do it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:56:45
if it breaks below ~12500$ you should be worried. Everything above can be seen as correction
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:58:15
In germany you have to pay up to 42% for your gains even if you just flip between coins without fiat involved
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:46:52
just taking profit on the way up
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:14:27
If you think like this IOTA will rek both in the future
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:48:48
It is similar. A lot of these cryptos will pop. But the survivers will have  the same impact in the future that amazon and others have now. It's still just the beginning in crypto
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:01:06
Just send them a lawyers letter and move your funds to another bank
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:06:22
that happens when money is pulled out of the market into fiat
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:38:10
we will see. If they would the the blow off right now they are not smart. they can gain way more
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:08:01
all hopped into bcc
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:47:50
the bull trap will be set in 2 years maybe. we are somewhere at media attention if even
