Again ... you can reach only who has internet and you are forecasting a 100% adoption, don't you think it's a little bit too much? does uber has 100% adoption of transportation? non even cash has 100% adoption! Some countries in south africa don't use cash but they trade and they will continue to do so!!!!! so yes, those numbers are way way way off! 3 transaction per day are also a huge overestimation of how many transactions a person does a day, I don't know where this number comes from but I don't do 50 tx per day.
While it's important to think of a system that is scalable we need to be realistic and understand what's needed NOW  and in the near future.
Also ... are you saying that a blocksize will never be more than 1MB even with LN?? I heard a different statement from who was presenting the LN.

Those numbers are completely off, it's suggesting that the whole world makes 2 transactions per day in average, first while the adoption we hope it will be wide thinking of a 100% adoption is a scarse sense of business and reality, second I don't do 2 transactions per day in average, and many countries don't do 2 transactions per months anyway! While the LN is a great idea and it can be extremely powerful it will still require bigger block sizes so wouldn't be better to start with that while LN has time to develop and be tested and the market does not freak out for the fees? News like Microsoft stopping the payiments don't do good to bitcoin
