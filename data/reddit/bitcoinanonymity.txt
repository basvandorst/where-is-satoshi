Oh, I just looked at the address that sent the BTC to it and saw it had quite a bit of history, so I did a quick search on the sending address "14C9Twcmr6iJLBA2fAt2RZ3c27bBwoNj9w" and found this information. If you ctl+f for that address on the linked page you will see where I found it.

Its not as anonymous as some claim it to be, and if you value your privacy be sure to create new addresses for your transactions, among other things.

There are many ways to go about it, creating new addresses is an easy way to increase privacy, but by no means foolproof. For example,
Single address:  A+B+C -&gt; D
Multiple addresses: A -&gt; D, B -&gt; E, C -&gt; F
For a single address if I knew who D was, I could tell that they received from A,B and C
But for the multiple addresses, I would have to know that addresses D,E and F all belong to the same user to know they received from A,B and C. So if I knew who D was, I could only see they received from A

Interesting side note about bitcoin anonymity, I was curious where this money came from. It appears ~~this address~~ the sending address is owned by Julius Kivimäki, a hacker who got quite a few bitcoins from Jack Levin of ImageShack for keeping quiet on hacked servers back in 2012, as well as a security audit. (among other things) Details here:

There is not a whole lot to expand on, I just thought it was interesting that this BTC was coming from a fairly shady background.
