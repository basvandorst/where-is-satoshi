Essentially yes this is possible. I asked this question during the AMA with Blockstream, here is what they said:
Lukejr: If one wanted to turn an existing altchain into a sidechain or sidechain-compatible altchain, it would need to (just like Bitcoin) either use a softfork or federated pegging. Once that is in place, it would be up to the other sidechains whether they wish to accept that altchain's assets being moved in or not in addition to (or instead of) bitcoins. If the current altchain is also desired to accept other assets (like bitcoins) being transferred in as a parallel asset to its native altcoin, it would be easiest done as a hardfork.
Adam Back: 
another concept is multiple pegging: different contracts or assets from different chains can be pegged to a given chain. this allows composability of assets and contracts between chains.
Jorge Timon:
Altchain is a generic term that includes both altcoins and sidechains. If you mean "Can an altcoin chain be a sidechain too?" The answer is yes. You can read more about this in section "6.1 Hashpower attack resistance", in the point "Subsidy".

thanks but I've already replied to this 'nakamoto institute' post about appcoins - and recommended that the author actually read the Maidsafe whitepaper as it would clarify a lot of his ill founded assumptions

Sidechains is getting developed for release most likely next year in 2015.
In the meantime, the closest thing I've heard of is the Factom project which is hashing transactions offchain and using a meta protocol to the Bitcoin Blockchain to encode
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:39:10
Ethereum doesn't need to issue a 'pre-token' 
When the Maidsafe network comes online, it was said maidsafecoin will be called Safecoin.
Factom whitepaper is only avail in PDF though I have created a text version at your request here:

- it is confusing to people who think blockchain.info is an official company of bitcoin.
- this is so common, that blockchain.info is aware of it and probably receives alot of customer feedback asking questions unrelated to its business but just generally about Bitcoin
- which means Blockchain.info is aware of the confusion its causing, and is knowingly benefitting from causing this misunderstanding with newcomers to the industry.
- i stopped using blockchain.info months ago, i encourage everyone else to do the same
- if you have any doubts, check out their joke of a security policy

i would recommend reviewing your thoughts and including the role of demand as a market mechanism

Your definitions are off - doesn't accurately reflect what's happening on the protocol level.
(Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string)

The paper says merge mining is not necessary for side chains to happen - one of the core devs provided a great answer here:
"They are independent concepts.
A (pegged) sidechain is a chain which supports moving assets (most likely BTC) from and to other chains.
Merged mining is a mechanism through which existing hashpower for one chain can be used to secure (or attack!) another chain. The alternative is requiring miners to choose between one and the other.
Sidechains can be merged-mined or not."

Storjcoin is issued and controlled by Storj itself
Storj has launched its own network and it uses a counterparty created asset, but that does not mean counterparty controls or issues this asset. 
I'm not sure where you got that from.
Storjcoin is one coin.
It sounds like you are confusing Maidsafecoin and Safecoin as they were the ones to announce a temporary coin as a 'stand in' for crowdsale participants.
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:04:56
Can you explain how Storj is involved with Factom?
@_date: 2014-12-26 20:37:28
one does not have to look far to see that the author of the post you mentioned is inaccurate in his assumptions who said "once the arguments in this essay become well enough understood by investors, that it will be impossible to fund a project by selling an appcoin because the price will rapidly tend to zero."-- 
Maidsafe says it here: " This approach increases reuse of the coins, further incentivising miners. This proof of resource will represent disk space, CPU and bandwidth involved in storing shards of information. These resources will increase over time, creating a much desired increasing value for safecoin holders, while delivering exponential decreases in the cost of resources. The proof of resource algorithm will over time account for additional resources, such as proof of bandwidth, proof of CPU processing, etc."

A few things to answer your point:
Appcoins are created to transact on networks outside of the Bitcoin Blockchain - Factom is a great example of this. Their value is based on market demand for the coin - which is based on network resources and demand for services requiring the coin itself.
It sounds like you haven't looked into these projects, I would recommend reading first Maidsafe, then Storj, and Factom's whitepaper.
Maidsafe: 
Storj: 
Factom:

not exactly - storjcoin awards hard drive mining which is done through DriveShare. This is an application that will be functioning as distributed nodes.
A central authority is not needed to authorize rewards

What's your point?
Do something about it

You are confusing some elements here - Maidsafe and Storj were created using protocols on the Bitcoin Blockchain. 
Maidsafecoin became Safecoin, Storj has one coin and it is not a stand-in for a different coin later on.
Factom tokens will be created in a similar fashion as those above, and because it will be encoding data on federated servers they require its own token.
Altcoins are not Appcoins, and though I agree that those who have separate blockchains and separate wallets are considered altcoins - these meta tokens do not function this way.
Storj coin was made using Counterparty
Maidsafe was made using Mastercoin
Factom will be made using Omni/Mastercoin
All of these use the Bitcoin Blockchain, and all tokens made using these protocols including Colored Coins are able to be sent and received from Bitcoin wallets - though it does not mean they will work from Bitcoin wallets.
Ethereum could not have done the same thing and it makes sense that they made Ethereum coin because it is a seperate blockchain. This is more likely an alt-coin than what you said above.

Clef uses cryptographic signatures to authenticate users so the only info stored is your public key

Yes the title of this post is misleading. I'm one of the creators behind  and we decided not to use counterparty

It's a nice idea but unrealistic in terms of venture raises where they prefer to own the ip and the assets

The second half of the deck is spot on with enterprise trends. What's missing is indeed the Blockchain but that's because the disruption hasn't happened yet on a scale large enough to be noticed as an enterprise play. Isle of Man and Honduras were two plays that just happened, we will likely see this in Mary Meeker's report next year. 
(Smart contracts may be considered next year as well if the platforms get released)

why is this getting downvoted?
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:07:08
Simple you can't
1. you have already verified an account with an exchange/processor (Coinbase, Circle, Bitfinex, etc) and transferred/wired money from a bank account
2. you know someone locally (possibly from a bitcoin meet up) who can meet you or receive interac/popmoney email money transfer
3. there's a bitcoin ATM nearby 
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:31:02
That makes it a lot less interesting.
However this means that we can pay people if they are in a certain area, downloaded an app, and if we have their public keys - this is one step away from punch clocks for shift work

Tether will use Factom's proof of existence layer.
and Factom will leverage Tether's hedge platform for securing value against the USD.
Its to ensure transparency from the Tether side that their transactions are provable, also solves the blocktime problem while avoiding the bloat on the blockchain issue.

"Although RFC 6238 allows different parameters to be used, the Google implementation of the authenticator app does not support T0, TI values, hash methods and token lengths different from the default. It also expects the K secret key to be entered (or supplied in a QR code) in base-32 encoding according to RFC 3548.[3]"
