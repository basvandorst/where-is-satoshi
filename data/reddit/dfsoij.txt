I'd say it's a bubble when the majority of the value is based on short term momentum trading  (i.e. "it's going up so I want to buy it"). Bitcoin definitely qualifies.

@_date: 2018-09-23 01:00:03
interesting, thanks. maybe I'll see for myself someday.
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:06:22
I'm not sure what exactly you mean. A crash comes at the end of a bubble, but not at the beginning.
@_date: 2018-09-23 00:35:11
It's definitely evidence that the risk is much higher than most people would have guessed last week.
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:44:51
Big thanks are owed to this dev. Great work finding and responsibly handling the bug.
@_date: 2018-09-23 00:59:15
The crash is part of a normal bubble
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:52:31
Just saw that, thanks! I was able to successfully send with it, now I'm sending my coin balance over to the other wallet, that can receive. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:03:56
It relevant for me only when fees spiked up and I was unable to make cheap, fast transactions. If that happens again would it be relevant?  Do you think it will ever be relevant again, or will we stay at current size forever?
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:06:27
Very interesting. I didn't know that a HF becomes harder with adoption of layer 2.
So in your view either on chain transaction volume will never exceed capacity again (like it did when fees spiked) or even if it does, no increase to block size is likely to ever occur?

I have the app, but I haven't been able to send it coins to the bech 32 address. I have a ledger nano s and the copay app on my phone, but neither seems to be able to send coins to the bech 32 address. Any recommendations on how to load up the lightening wallet?
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:11:16
I got the app, and I have coins, but I can't figure out how to send to the bech 32 address in the app. Any suggestions?
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:30:47
went with a different app suggested in this thread that worked better thanks
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:40:26
sweet, thanks. got the app. loading up some coin. I'll try out the spinner once it's all confirmed.
@_date: 2018-08-06 12:48:54
Because it's a fork if the original blockchain, and a real competitor.
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:21:59
this app has turned out to be work much better than the other lightening wallet. thanks for the suggestion. I still have yet to successfully make an LN transaction, but I'm on the way there...
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:59:57
When do you think it will be needed (i.e. what's your criteria)?
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:01:44
@_date: 2018-08-16 22:32:34
Even "international"? Lol
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:38:20
They banned a lot of discussion of forks, which was a big part of the technical debate. When that happened and that discussion moved elsewhere, it left behind memes. I suggest checking out other subs if you're interested in more substantive discussion
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:40:18
lambo exactly
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:24:22
OK, OK, on further review... immolated's comment was actually not bad. He's right that deflation leads to nominal wage cuts, that it doesn't make things more affordable, and that inflation has benefits. It's a stretch to say "inflation is good" but it's a commonly held belief by many economists, so fair enough.
I was mostly triggered when I clicked on the article "why deflation is bad" which said dumb shit like:
\&gt;the Fed has to increase M and "print all this money out of thin air," or the system collapses.
Deflation doesn't cause the system to collapse. Yes, rapid change in the price of money (in either direction) causes malinvestment, but deflation isn't evil and it won't cause "the system" to "collapse"
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:28:26
Damn this triggers me so bad. I wish I had time to rebut all these arguments. Respond if interested and I'll actually do it.
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:36:22
Technically not true. Value changes all the time! I'm glad we're both in it for the long haul though.
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:04:56
thanks good point. maybe I'll wait a bit longer to try it out, once it's stable
@_date: 2018-07-28 22:57:43
Oh yea, I meant the Ayre Group, not coingeek alone. Coingeek is just part of the Ayre Group.
@_date: 2018-07-28 17:43:06
I'm super surprised that everyone here seems to agree with you (judging by the upvotes) that no one uses it. I'm just one guy, but I use it on sites like blockchain.poker, cheapair, and purse.io. Do you think I'm just a really tiny minority?
I'd be really curious to see any published stats on usage rates from sites that support both BTC and BCH. If anyone has stats / sources for that, please let me know, thanks.
@_date: 2018-07-28 17:58:19
Thanks I'll check it out. Was also thinking try sending to someone / somewhere that takes it.
@_date: 2018-07-28 20:57:36
I was mistaken. Their partner entity, coingeek, only accepts BCH for the program, but other partners could legally take BTC or other coins. Would be glad to find out who they are, or more info, if you have any.
@_date: 2019-09-11 23:22:52
I didn't follow your explanation. What's the best source for me to read a clearer articulation of that view?
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:31:51
Nah, I don't have any good data. That's why I'm asking. Sounds like you don't know of any either? but if you do find some, share it!
@_date: 2018-07-28 20:56:10
the OP?
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:05:24
Thanks, I will try this. Very cool.

"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"
Gold is not a payment system. Gold is not crypto.
@_date: 2018-07-28 20:27:51
ok thanks, I'll take you up on that actually. I'm going mess around on my own first and put some change in there then I'll pm you. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-07-28 22:53:04
alright sweet, I will try it for sure then. thanks for the tip
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:00:11
that's a bit too high of a degree of difficult for me. thanks for the suggestion. I may try it out down the road!
@_date: 2019-09-11 18:08:54
I agree with the first part. But Bitcoin is a payment system, and it can compete with other payment systems.
In fact, when designing Bitcoin, satoshi said "The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide. Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost."
@_date: 2018-07-29 11:21:51
BCH. I don't necessarily disagree, it just surprises me. I would be glad to see some stats or information on usage (outside of on chain tx volume, which I can see).
