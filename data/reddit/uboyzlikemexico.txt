Absolutely. To me, a dilution like what they are proposing is the most obvious way to spot the scam. Having a private server (not an actual blockchain) and only an internal "market" are also extremely telling, even more so than the dilution, but they are probably not as obvious to non-technical laymen.

That obviously won't work because, while they will double everyone's coins, total supply will be expanded from something like 1B to 120B total coins. They're going to heavily devalue everyone's holdings.

Maybe its ego, but I also think its because the crypto space is still new and tiny. 
Foundations/Associations etc can work. Its just a body to unite interested parties and individuals. I think a good example would be the NRA. Maybe stronger leadership is needed, the space appears to be (to me at least) mostly of introverts and nerd types (terms used loosely) - not typically leaders in a social setting, but definitely leaders in a technological setting.

Total quantity (21M) is known. Nothing new is being created, its just being doled out at a given time. 
Like I don't think inflation is the correct word, but I don't know what the correct word would be, maybe you're right. It just doesn't seem right in the contexts of traditional discussion of money/assets, at least to me.
Is gold inflating, or is it just being mined when the price seems right? Differing from even gold, bitcoin production is extremely consistent, it doesn't care what the price is. Production will continue to bear fruit every 10min, on average, irrelevant of any other factors.

My Quick 'n Dirty
In terms of 101:
S: More transactions possible
W: Possible security risk; Mining centralization; Fewer Miners
O: More 3rd party innovation directly on the network in shorter time. Reduces potential need for altcoins to deal with market need for crypto.
T: Future hard fork to reduce block size if centralization/miner reduction occurs will be more difficult to execute than a potential future increase hard fork from too much demand if 202 is used.

"Marking it" may not the best way of controlling the supply. They're just bitcoins after all. Maybe govt's could only accept their colored coin for tax payments or military salaries to at least create some level of demand.
The better way might be to acquire a significant portion of bitcoin, hodl it, then if/when the market shows signs of deflation (btc price increases), flood the market with your significant number of hodl'd coins. The problem is, if bitcoin is that important, what in the world is a CB going to trade for bitcoin, since bitcoin is important enough for them to need to "adjust." A CB's currency won't be nearly as valued - ultimately leading to its hyperinflation and demise.

1) The larger the block size, the longer it takes for a solved block to propagate through the network. 
2) When miners find a block, they want their solution to propagate as fast as possible throughout the network. They "win" the bitcoins if they're first.
3) Miners with slower internet, or folks behind firewalls which could slow international combination/propagation, don't want larger blocks because it will slow the propagation of their mined/solved block. They won't win the bitcoins simply because their internet is slow. 
Thus 
4) The larger the block size, the fewer the miners. 
Also 
5) A significant portion of bitcoin mining is done in China. 
Make sense?  
EDIT/ADDITION: Miners would prefer a hard limit because they can at least project/strategize how well they will perform i.e. how much bitcoin they will earn given a block size. Having no upper limit brings in too much risk for many of them.

Nobody has broken the algorithm. Its got a big fat $5B bounty (current BTC market cap) on it for anyone who can break it and a lot of folks have/are trying. Read up on "elliptic curves/elliptic curve cryptography" if you haven't, the shit is mind blowing.
The links you provided were of issues pertaining to a 3rd party (Mt.Gox in this case), and I don't doubt that there will be fuckups by third parties in the future. My coins are kept offline. I don't worry about them one bit. 
Only issues I (mildly) worry about are 51% attacks, some future quantum computing capability that can break the cryptography, or hardcore regulation/banning by govts. But, even if any of those happen, I find it difficult to come up with a way that bitcoin dies because of it. The price will just take a bit of a hit while the solution is figured out. 
TL,DR: Bitcoin is as safe as keeping $250k or less in an FDIC insured account. Bitcoin is more safe than keeping more than $250k in an FDIC insured account. Bonus points to bitcoin since they can't be confiscated like money in your bank account.

I used Core when I first learned about bitcoin, then moved to Multibit since it was quicker and easier for me. 
I now run a node/Core on a separate laptop just for kicks really. Don't want it on my main laptop though. That being said, block size increase doesn't factor into whether I will continue to run a node or not.

@_date: 2015-12-17 03:27:27
Looks like we're going extreme ("everyone holding," "no one spending"). I'll try my best to remain extreme:
Transaction fees are irrelevant so long as there is a mining reward. That won't end until 2140, so I'm not concerned at all by that. The market price of the coin determines the number of miners willing to mine (via profit/loss of mining).
I see nothing wrong with enormous transaction fees, so long as its the market that determines it (can't be forced). For those that *really* *really* *really* need to do a settlement on the network, it will be worth it (big money movement). Off chain transactions will likely bear most of the total transactions, much like how we have it today - bitcoin exchanges are doing about two million transactions a day already. The core network will be for major settlements. 
Network security (via decentralized trust) is the main thing I keep my eyes on. Thats the major differentiator that crypto brings to the table IMO.

This is an opinion piece, so I was offering my differing opinion. I still would prefer for folks like Icahn to not meddle with stuff (yet). He's not known for creating stuff to extract wealth, he's known for buybacks and slashing waste to extract wealth. I prefer the creators. Again just my humble opinion. 
I get your points though. No doubt, other big money will be coming on board soon to join those who are already here. I just would *prefer* a little more insanity before this thing fully leaves the station and we all have to (metaphorically) put on our suits and ties.

Every company in every sector wants to become a monopoly. This isn't limited to the tech sector.
However, take a look at different sectors - the ones with the most regulation (example: defense, finance) are the ones with the greatest concentrations of power/market share. Companies want to build barriers to entry to keep out competition. Many do this through regulation, as its much easier to use the hammer of the law rather than innovate to effectively block competitors or upstarts.
This is why it is so important for bitcoin to have as little regulation as possible, preferably none. Its the only way for the users to benefit in the end. A natural monopoly is possible, but only if its a voluntary monopoly - one, in a sense, chosen by the users.

Good point. But how do they get their cash into something like that? None of these guys have bank accounts or credit cards. Banks aren't working with them. Not sure if pre-paid debit would work. 
I don't push bitcoin too hard, I just bring it up as something interesting when talking to them. Trying to plant seeds :)  I'm in contact with owners (growers, store owners). They're surprisingly professional. Maybe they, or their employees might use btc for personal use, but for a business account I'm doubtful,  near term at least.

^ Agreed. Icahn is straight business, which is good when you think strictly about money and consider absolutely nothing more, except as a means to more money. He's good at what he does, but I'm hesitant to think his abilities are useful or even beneficial for bitcoin at this point.

Ok, fair enough. You are right that they are skewing the story towards the negative with the words they choose. Thats how news companies work, and I'm not quite sure how to spin an easy to read story about how adoption is continuing even though the price has tanked for 2014 without going into details that most general readers just won't give a shit about. Price is what gets eyes on the story. I don't think we'll change it or the opinions of the people reading it, whoever the fuck reads business-standard.com. Will probably just look like crazy cultists if the page is spammed by defenders anyway. The article hasn't changed my mind towards bitcoin (that its awesome), and I doubt that it will change the minds of the 60 non-bitcoin stakeholders that will read it.

I've talked to some folks in the industry in Colorado about bitcoin. I've concluded two major reasons they haven't adopted and I assume the same reasons apply to the Washington folks as well:
1) Bitcoin is too volatile. These guys are making money hand over fist right now. Serious bucks. They're not trying to use bitcoin to get rich or anything, and the volatility of dollars is just fine from their standpoint. 
2) Legality. We can argue all day that bitcoin is legal and that they have nothing to worry about, but the vast majority of these guys are playing their game by the book. Impeccable accounting and reporting. This weed legality is currently from the state's perspective, not Federal. A lot of these guys are waiting for the Feds to make an example of someone, so they are running very tight ships. They don't want to take on any potential (even though unlikely) legal risks with bitcoin. 
Other than those two, they're game. These guys are carrying around five to ten pre-paid debit cards and 10k in cash when they travel (the limit for air travel is 10k). Other than that, they're moving money by stuffing it into gym bags. Incredibly dangerous, of course, but they've learned to live with it.

@_date: 2014-10-08 07:25:56
When the chain is forked, there become effectively two chains. However, its highly likely that miners will choose only one chain to mine. Even if there is disagreement amongst miners which chain should be mined on, ultimately one chain will win out - the one with the most miners, as it will also be the chain with the most users and the most value. Overtime, whether it be one min, an hour, or a year, one chain will win since there is a strong incentive for miners to spend their time and investment reaping the benefits that come from mining on the strongest chain. Thus, coins on the alternate chain become worthless, since no one is really using/mining/trusting that chain.

I dont deny his ability to make money, or to streamline companies to make them more efficient. I also can't deny his access to massive amounts of wealth via his own checkbook or others in his circle. Whether someone likes him or hates him, its impossible to deny his record. He puts money in shareholders' pockets.
My point is that Bitcoin is still really, REALLY, early stages now, IMO. We need crazies who are willing to take a risk on a seemingly stupid idea. Many will fail, some will find riches, but they're all willing to shoot straight from the hip. Bitcoin still needs these this type of person to create, not someone who can look at a balance sheet or org structure to be efficient. Creativity isn't efficient at all, its really messy, and I personally would prefer to not see that messiness affected yet. Just my opinion though.

Yes, they could incorporate their own block chain/bitcoin system. What folks are trying to get across is that the benefits that "we" are all ranting and raving about thanks to bitcoin/**decentralized** blockchain are negated if a single entity has ultimate control.
The govt.'s/banks already have their own ledger, but its centralized. Arguably this is more efficient than a decentralized blockchain based ledger. The pro-bitcoin argument is that the benefits of a decentralized ledger outweigh the benefits of a (probably more) efficient centralized ledger.  
Its hard to make a value-added argument for a centralized blockchain type ledger. You get none of the benefits decentralization provides, and you get none of the benefits (efficiencies) that a controlled ledger system provides.

I don't know if this gets filed under corruption, manipulation, or an opportunity in a purely free market for a titan but, for example, if Bezos wanted to make a metric shit ton of money, he could buy a bunch of bitcoin over time then, when he hits his coin quota, announce that Amazon will be accepting bitcoin. Price would shoot through the roof (probably).
He could probably double the effect by downplaying the potential for bitcoin acceptance, driving the market down, buying cheap coins. 
This assumes he could keep this strategy and his cabal of insiders on the DL. 
May be crazy to even consider, but it is a reason for me to own even one coin. The ability for a tech titan to make an insane killing this way is kinda surreal, yet possible, and legal!

So is $150, assuming one only needs to handle 3.5TB/year @ 10MB blocks. Respectfully, do you really think anyone making less than $300 is going to have the bandwidth or even a computer to run a node or mine? Arguing for equality for all will only delay the benefits bitcoin will bring to the poor whom you are worried about. BTW, I also think bitcoin has ridiculously awesome potential to help poor/lower income people, and is precisely the thing that got me interested in it initially (makes P2P micropayments possible - screw using Kiva ever again). 
I can't afford a jet airliner, but I still get to enjoy crossing a continent in 5 hours on one. I can't afford to buy 1000's of books to read, but I can go to my local library. Lets not get all bitcoin hippy (equal individual freedom for all man!) on this.

I figured it was 10min +- a few minutes on average. I don't watch blocks being found all that often, so this caught my attention. Just did a search and found out about much longer times between blocks, but those were from back in the day (2010-2011). Figured it would be a bit tighter on the time variation with all the processing power out there now...
Thanks for the help!

Interesting take, made me think a bit. But don't the miners ultimately have to "throw the switch?" You're right that they have to make sure they can sell the coins to wiling buyers, but they are effectively the ultimate deciders of the system to be used, no?

I was mostly thinking because whatever the cut they get (assuming its a percentage of transacted value of coin - think exchanges), its decreasing. There would have to either be an increase in volume or an increase in value for a business model like that (taking a %) to be maintained. I'm making an admittedly broad assumption that a depressed price will drive away newbs from coming on board and playing with bitcoin, thereby decreasing the total value that these platforms ultimately make. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:33:06

I get that they don't want deflation because it makes credit/loans harder to pay back. I get that this will likely increase equities' and commodities' price (maybe Bitcoin too) relative to the Euro.
The thing that upsets me over and over again is that the poorer classes don't understand the effect of this, and why investing works to one's benefit (not necessarily strictly savings), which is what keeps them poor. I honestly feel like it's straight stealing from people who just want to save the value they've created through blood, sweat, and tears, only to have it yanked from them without them even knowing it. 
I get bankers' reasoning, I get that someone who's versed minimally can understand the cause and effect relationship of QE and all other assets, and I believe that the Central Bankers' intentions are good. I just hate the fact that the majority who don't understand what QE does basically leaves them scraping for sustenance for eternity. The unintended consequence of QE is that those who don't understand this monetary manipulation don't stand a chance...
Maybe it's not the best reason, but this seemingly unstoppable Global "QE" business is a big reason why I support bitcoin.

I think I can relate to that liberating feeling of realizing the illusion of success and the fear of not attaining "it" (whatever success actually means to the individual).

No, but I don't think they invest in companies/technologies where the (arguably) main industry metric, price in this case, is all over the place - at the moment way low relative to when they made their announcements and "pumping" rounds earlier last year. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 06:11:09
Ok, I'll bite. 
I suppose my all encompassing answer for commodities and stocks in companies is: Its not really about what you can make, its about the solution you can provide. I'm not sure if you've ever made a bitcoin transaction, but I have yet to meet a person who has used it and understands it who also doesn't think it has serious value. 
The ability to transfer value quickly and without friction (i.e., from third parties) between individuals is a pillar in what allows for our modern economy. Bitcoin is, IMO, a significant leap in capability of this value transfer paradigm. Supposing this is true, more and more people will use it more and more. Given that there is a limited supply of bitcoin, as its use (demand) increases, for purposes of store of value or transaction purposes, there will be a requirement for it to increase in its value. Again, this assumes that its demand will increase.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:19:42

So should we consider it "bad" if bitcoin goes to say $600/coin in the next month? Just curious, given the point you made. Thats volatility, but one that a lot of folks would probably like to see. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:05:32
Agreed. Though I do like to discuss extremes because I can apply their principles to more likely/less extreme outcomes, a lot of this continued extreme arguing sounds like a bunch of college students discussing the merits and meanings of Socratic teachings. Its making me sick. 
In the big boy world we note an issue, develop potential solutions, pick a solution and execute on it, then note issues and fix them, so on and so forth. There isn't one thing on this planet thats done right the first time, and many of the issues we all think might happen probably won't happen, and many issues we didn't think about probably will. 
The blockchain doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be better. Block increase is *probably* going to be better. If not, we'll adjust then. 
Note that I also think the proposed increase in the block size isn't ideal, but its probably the best combination of scaling, minimal effort, and speed to market. Its a pretty good solution to see what effects additional future scaling might have on the system.

Just conjecture, but I think the illusion can last a very long time. Then, "they" can just blame someone else (jews, communists, terrorists, greedy bankers, lack of regulation etc) and get off scott free to perform it all over again. 
The poor/middle class I think are the ones who have to wake up. The rich folks know how this game (money) is played. Poor/middle folk don't generally educate themselves to how money, value, or wealth work, or what they even are. Unfortunately, I don't think this will ever change. Its probably more prudent as an individual to recognize this and use it to your advantage, however that may be.

I agree with your thought experiment. When I first understood bitcoin, (my "Holy Shit!" moment) I realized that it was the second best form of money I could possibly imagine. The only better form would be one that could cross a distance faster than light (a true, instantaneous, intergalactic value transfer protocol). This is where we start to sound insane to newbs and doubters though, so I don't talk about that much anymore myself  :D
All I know is that my hair was blown away when I understood bitcoin. But then the dial turned to 11 and my face melted when I realized that bitcoin is fully capable, even in its current form, of being a representation of value other than its own traded value - it can actually represent the ownership of actual goods, services, debts, and credits (i.e. a car title) and be passed between individuals. 
The funny thing is that I went through the same steps you mentioned in WSJ. I'm betting most people who are in to bitcoin did the same: Technerd bullshit noise -&gt; scam -&gt; nice idea, wont work -&gt; (read about it) -&gt; yeah, but what about xxx problem? -&gt; Holy Shit! -&gt; Face Melt -&gt; friends/family think you're crazy -&gt; only purpose to work is to get more bitcoin -&gt; social life is shot to shit -&gt; feeble attempt at getting life back in order -&gt; get life back in order to 80% on third attempt -&gt; ??? -&gt; profit!
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:13:34


Thats me :)


500k/coin? I absolutely would take that. 
I doubt any gov't would give me 500k/coin straight up though. So, as far as I can tell, the most likely way for bitcoin to net me enough wealth to never have to work again, plus have money left over for at least *some* hookers and blow, is to ensure network security (I run a node, best I can do). The other issue I have is fungibility (I don't know how to solve it). Next would be block limit, but that is a far third for me (I'm hanging tight while you guys rustle this issue out of your jimmies). 
@_date: 2015-05-28 18:12:16
"You can take the technology which underlies bitcoin, which is called the blockchain...when you apply it to money you get bitcoin, but when you apply it to the stock market, you can apply it to the stock market and you can create a stock market that they can't rig."
Byrne is pretty damn smart, so I'm assuming by this statement that he means the future *will* be using bitcoin, just not **only** as a currency. The intended use of bitcoin is malleable, given that it is no more than a unique digital value token, and it can represent value as well as can be valuable in and of itself. 
Am I correct in this interpretation?
**EDIT: added the word "only"**
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:44:44
Yes you can just hold your bitcoin. When a fork happens, you will have coins on both portions of the fork, since they were in an address you determined prior to the fork. 
Like others have said, try not to spend/move bitcoins during the fork, it may get convoluted for you to keep tabs on which fork has what coins. Hodling throughout the fork is the easiest/best route.
@_date: 2016-01-20 00:36:51
Any idea how much spam to fill the blocks costs? Every transaction I've made so far (last two years) has been free. I don't make many, but thats my data point. Some didn't go through on the first or second block, but they've all gone through. 
I'm talking about spamming to just consistently filling the blocks, not necessarily to create a significant backlog (which I assume could end up costing a lot).
Perhaps the solution is simply that miners can choose to not include the transactions in their mined block?
@_date: 2016-01-19 01:59:48
Agreed on all your points, and thanks for the info. I run a node just for kicks, no mining though. Maybe if I ever get around to figuring out ROI, I'll put a bit of money into it.

20MB blocks is a little over 7TB of data a year. I can get a HDD from newegg for $300 with that much capacity. Thats less than $1/day. Baby stuff in the grand scheme of things, and I only run a node! Plus, thats at today's prices. Next year it will be even cheaper. 
10MB sounds good now because Gavin's original proposal was 20MB. I'm guessing if he originally said 40MB, your post would say 20MB. 
20MB is a pretty good test/band aid until a more permanent solution is found.

Frivolous transactions. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 01:41:18
Its not highly simplistic, it the truth: industries with greater regulation have a higher concentration of power in fewer companies than in unregulated markets. 
Innovation, defined as creating a new method, product, or idea, is also less in highly regulated industries as compared to industries with fewer or no regulation.  
It could have been viewed as simplistic if my point about companies enacting regulation instead of actually innovating is stressed too much. I don't mean that to be the sole reason that regulation gets enacted, but it is one. My fault if I made it sound like it was the main driver of my point. 
The examples about monopolies not abusing their monopoly and/or blocking out competitors via regulations is a great academic argument, but both of those things happen in the real world. Its in a stakeholders best interest (in terms of return on investment) to do both of those.  
Same with tragedy of the commons - a more common argument in academia than real world. When there is a limited supply of something, price goes up. When it gets too limited, the price to procure is too expensive, decreasing demand and diverting investment to alternatives.

I'm thinking along the lines of simply doing a ton of transactions, no fees. Just fill up the blocks. Those transactions will get "bumped" of course, assuming other transactions have fees.
I guess the only solution that comes to my head is that the miners will ultimately choose which transactions get put in the blocks, so they'll only accept transactions with fees. But this brings me back to my original point that... **Ohhhhhhh.** This just solved it (I think): If miners can choose which transactions to include, they'll include only those with fees. Increasing the block size allows for them to choose more transactions with fees, which also allows for more throughput, and which also causes "meaningful" spam (i.e. that which is meant to disrupt the network) to cost something - a lot, over time probably.

The egregious amounts of "QE" (printing money) over the past few years. 
The poor and middle class people who don't own hard assets / investments and generally only have savings accounts have been completely screwed by it, while the rich made boat loads of money from it. 
When I first read the white paper I thought that bitcoin was the first legitimate chance that people have to really turn the tides on the control of value. 
Unfortunately, following bitcoin has made me cynical. Your typical poor and middle class folks don't seem to care or are scared of the tech.

Yes, bitcoin can theoretically fall out of fashion, as you put it. 
The comparison between bitcoin and something like MySpace or Yahoo is a bit different, from a user perspective though. The cost and risk associated with a change to another social networking site, or to a different homepage is trivial to the user. 
Imagine being a new user who started a profile and posted to Digg a week before the Digg exodus of 2010 to Reddit. No real skin off your back, you didn't really lose much. Is that same scenario likely to happen to bitcoin? Not really, because users actually have a vested interest in the product. Still possible, yes, but no where near as likely. Any competitor will likely have to provide an extremely good value proposition compared to bitcoin, as well as provide a solution that bitcoin can't easily replicate. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 20:55:43
True. They did their first exchange on bitcoin though. Probably why mind mind is set this way currently.
Also, keeping in line with the standard bitcoin canon here, the most secure network will become the de-facto network. I suppose this is true barring the inability to use said network i.e. because its full.

The guy that owns the iron foundry and train network *has his wealth tied up* in the the iron foundry and the train network. **His wealth is not in dollars or bitcoins, it is in the foundry and the network** and he will remain rich no matter what kind of currency is used. People will pay him for his goods and services in whatever form of tradable commodity/currency he wishes to accept - whatever brings *him* value.
He can choose to sell a stake or the entire thing if he wishes, for whatever he chooses. If bitcoin is what he wants to sell/trade for, he'll get bitcoin, if he wants dollars, he'll get dollars. If he wants to trade for a chicken farm or maybe a rocket ship, assuming he can find someone to trade for that, he can get that too.
The owners of revenue generating businesses will not "lose out" if bitcoin takes over. The only people who will lose out are people who own a product that depreciates in value relative to bitcoin. A train network that moves physical goods won't lose value to bitcoin ever, since bitcoin itself can't move physical goods.

I get that they could get the transaction through by paying a higher fee. I'm referring to absolute volume here - which would be intense, fees are almost irrelevant since a percent of a percent of t's via T0 could go through.

Within five years. I still don't believe any of the previous bubbles (2011, mid 2013, late 2013) were anything more than issues related to Gox though.
When the "true" bubble comes though, I expect it to be quite spectacular. Nasdaq 2000 will be baby stuff. 
I have a weird feeling (just a feeling, but based on what I've read around here for the past three years) that bankers are accumulating coins now, and they'll pump the shit out of it when they're ready.

The only slight worry I really have is the temporary fallout in the price/confidence in bitcoin should Satoshi decide to sell off all his coins. This also assumes that he gives little to no reason, leaving many to likely speculate some level of doom in the system. I say temporary because I assume that nothing is wrong with the system and that confidence will likely return, since it is math based and still working. 
Now, in terms of someone with that much power, because money essentially = power, I can assume two extremes. The first is that Satoshi is inherently "good." He'll either hold or he'll buy an island filled with hookers and blow, math books and a computer. Fair enough - the guy fucking deserves it. Maybe he'll buy GE and make jet engines or something.
The second is that he is "evil." Now, I have a really hard time believing that Satoshi is a destructive in nature, and would use that power for destruction. I just can't understand the incentive. I suppose its possible, but I put the probability infinitely close to zero. In terms of being a juggernaut in the new global economy, is it really that different from the powers that be now (govt fiat, central banking, IMF, etc)? Heck, if he has more power than TPTB now, at least he's limited to hard money. I also suppose that if it really gets that bad, folks could just just fork the chain, as u/pb1x stated, or use a completely different coin, reducing demand for bitcoin and thus reducing his purchasing power. Sort of like how governments today use sanctions to limit trade with other nations to limit their economic power. 
**Non-relevant question since I'm posting here and now:** How do I link user names in a post? I want to make sure I give properly give credit to other posters.

Bitcoin allows you to own and transfer a unique piece of digital data not issued or managed by an online authority - I'm not sure how to overstate how significant a breakthrough that is. How it ultimately gets used by people is anyone's guess at this point though, but the tech and potential is mind boggling. 
What gives me confidence is that I didn't really care for bitcoin for about two years after first hearing about it. Decided to really look into it after a friend mentioned he started playing with it. Got mindfucked after that. I figure the majority of haters are just ignorant like I was. I'm not calling people stupid, I'm just saying that it does take a pretty solid effort to understand bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:00:53
Yep, agreed. I also think that we're kind of watching the creation of fire promulgate across the species. Interesting, scary, and oh so powerful if wielded correctly. Either that, or, as I've said before, the steam engine being promoted to Roman elites. It's pretty advanced, but who knows if it'll catch. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:51:26
Didn't think of it that way until you said it. Good point. I'm not sure weather to laugh or to cry a bit now. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 20:44:09
For real, just buy some and play with it. 
(1) Buy $20 worth of coins. Consider the $20 gone - this is what we'll call your "education tax."
(2) Download your own wallet, so that you can play with bitcoin on your own terms. I use MultiBit, it is pretty straight forward and respected. 
(3) Send your coins from Circle/Coinbase to your MultiBit wallet. Send some coins from you wallet in MultiBit to another wallet you can make in MultiBit. Send some bitcoin from your MultiBit wallet back to your Coinbase/Circle account.
(4) Have a friend come over to hang out and have him download MultiBit on to his computer and set up his wallet. 
(5) Send some bitcoin to him, have him send some back to you. Realize then that these transactions are not going through any intermediaries, and that it is true peer-to-peer, digital, and is running on a decentralized automated network.
(6) Sit back in you chair and realize the game-changing potential of what you did with your friend. 
(7) Now that your interest is (likely) spiked, look into other things to do with coins. Maybe BIP32/38 security, multi signature transactions, and how to set up merchant acceptance, if you'd like. 
In my experience with bitcoin, no amount of discussing, reading, etc. can beat the insight and understanding gained from just playing around with some small amount for a bit. Again, just consider whatever small amount you buy for this personal experiment gone - its your learning expense. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:34:59
Yep. A pre-dump, if you will. I wish I were skeptical, but I'm straight up cynical at this point. Which sucks, because I love bitcoin, but the trend is the trend, until it isn't of course. I just don't really see any reason for there to be any massive buying over time to be occurring anytime soon. And no, Greece isn't a solid enough reason. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:05:11
Folks have been saying that for the past year. Maybe this is the change over point but, I'm not seeing any fundamental reason for a sustained rise.  
@_date: 2015-09-26 22:27:28
Thanks for the heads up. I was looking for more of a "personal" wallet capability, not through an online 3rd party like Coinbase, however.
Cool to see Coinbase was ahead of the curve on this.

Just a few, nothing too cray.
- MMM moving/hiding their new found wealth
- Pump by some group to get the Marshalls auction buyers to pay top dollar
- Investors buying up supply prior to auction in case they don't win it (game theory strategy).
The funny thing is that I think bitcoin is STILL undervalued. I guess the extreme price movement just has my jimmies rustled. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 06:23:27
Following bitcoin the past couple years has really opened my eyes to the power of some code as compared to the huge amount of resources put forth in traditional ways of affecting change in the world. Its stunning to think how technology changes an individual's and a people's views, values, and culture far faster and with a far greater impact than that of a vote. 
Interesting times ahead.

1) How in the world do you expect someone to deduce that from your previous statement?
2) The majority of the posts on this sub heavily skew towards the libertarian/anarchist flavor. Maybe libertarians/anarchists aren't the majority of bitcoiners anymore. I don't have any evidence one way or the other to make that claim. This sub, however, is heavy on lib/anarcho stuff. 
3) I never said anything about hating big banks, War on Drugs, or govt surveillance. Nor that libertarians/anarchists had a monopoly on these views. Where are you getting that from? I specifically stated a point about big gov't. I don't doubt that *some* liberals, libertarians, anarchists, and even conservatives view these issues the same way. My statement had to do with gov't size.

I was thinking that might be a possibility too. No proof of course. And, of course, this isn't my only "conspiracy theory" for why the price is doing what its doing.

I'm blown away that chief of the IMF, is talking about this. Whether or not she has even a clue WTF bitcoin is, the fact that she actually discusses it officially, is kinda crazy. 
"Don't be afraid" &lt;--- isn't that something people say to others when something scary is about to happen?  :)

Re-phrase your question from:
"Shouldn't people have a fair share?" 
"Does this make people better off?"  
Some folks have made a hell of a lot of money digging for oil and wheeling and dealing for land rights before I was even born. Heck, I'll probably never even see true oil in its virgin state, let alone own actual oil, any oil extraction machinery, or land that has oil under it. I'll probably never make a dime directly from or because of oil. In fact, I'm pretty sure I will have to pay to use it or any derivative of it throughout my life. 
My life is way better for their (the oil people's) efforts though. I can't imagine how much it would've sucked living without plastic, cars, electricity, and most modern medical equipment and supplies.

This is where my technical knowledge begins to break down. Is this like DRM?  
Also, "deemed genuine" I don't believe would be the end game, and is not what I'm really picturing, if I am understanding you correctly. More like "only ever producing and letting out in to the digital space genuine, uncopyable, digital movies. Its control over the digital supply of something is what is needed, not just a "stamp" of what is genuine. True scarcity of a digital item (movie).  
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:14:30
Seems plausible. I don't know if thats typical for regulations like this, but its an interesting reasoning. Thanks.

I'm not sure why he deleted it either. Seemed harmless. Maybe he fat fingered?
Basically he said to make a coin ("RarePepeCoin") and do it that way. Don't fuck up the rollout yada yada. He made a subreddit and everything, lol. I thought it was funny. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 18:23:45
Usury will still exist. Nothing wrong with that. The wrong that bitcoin can right is a return to a normal business cycle and not this current direct injection of money to the top of the food chain like we have today.

Perhaps something along the lines of a movie studio putting out digital copies of a movie, but maybe only a limited amount. Assuming there is a significant enough mining infrastructure to ensure the security and authenticity of this distribution of movies, the movies can actually be sold in digital form as if they were in physical form, meaning no instantly making copies and torrenting them. 
Something like that is what I thought bitcoin could maybe help with, though I haven't figured out how. It has gone through my mind that another "blockchain-type-technology" would need to be made to allow for this. Its also what I think these "blockchain technology" enthusiasts are thinking is the holy grail.

Usually, the rich ones are the folks who have assets (PMs, property, etc) to guard from inflation. It's the poor and middle class who get screwed from inflation, mostly because they have a currency based "savings account."
Heres the thing about huge wealth too - the wealthy only need like a 3% return on their millions of $ to live comfortably and continue making more money. Why bet at all on something risky like bitcoin when you can just buy an apartment complex near a military base or university and collect a constant stream of rent?
@_date: 2015-11-07 15:44:46
I'm not going to do homework for you. Look up any historical chart you want on deaths due to war or number of large scale wars over time and you will see a drop in wars/battles/casualties since since the Bretton-Woods collapse/Nixon shock in 1971, when the world has pretty much completely went on a fiat system. Sure fiat existed before that in some shape or form, but it became the dominant system at that point. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:56:36
If it pleases and sparkles, a suggestion: It will likely be more prudent to maintain a random amount of tip, just keep it &gt;=100bits, if thats the required threshold to send.
The randomness of the tip size will keep people playing, akin to the addictive behavior shown in those who play slot machines (thus equating to more potential ad revenue). If the tip is a static amount, It'll be much easier to, even intuitively, discern the amount of reward for the amount of time put in. Sounds crazily greedy, given that you're providing a unit a value to a player just for playing, but, Vegas odds (and Vegas psychology) say that you'll be better off.  
Happy to have helped. The interaction and building of the community is what makes it cool. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:41:58
Hmmm... Interesting possibility. I put a few minutes in here and there on the game throughout the day. Will note the tip amounts and see if that particular issue comes up.   
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:47:56
Correct. I collected the black coins, and "bought" the tip. 
Still haven't received the tips to the addresses though.

Can they make it illegal to accept? The US gov't has the power to not allow people to trade? (serious)
I'm thinking the only way to make it illegal for retailers to accept is to make it straight up illegal. How they will police that, I haven't the slightest clue.

I was really more interested with the inclusion of bitcoin for the project. Making another coin with a different name is one thing, but I'm trying to figure an integration method.

There's an economic incentive to bitcoin maintaining immutability. Basically, its the only thing bitcoin has going for it. 
The transaction reversal may have occurred in ETH because immutability takes a backseat to being able to build dapps on the system. Not sure if that will turn out to be more valuable than immutability though. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:32:14
