To "profit", do you basically need to buy BTC, transfer it to a wallet for a while, then transfer it back to an exchange to trade it for fiat, and then withdraw from the exchange? I've heard how you don't really own the coins while they're in the exchange, so it all seems a bit precarious.
Is it just a risk trade-off by keeping it in an exchange to make quicker trades when it hits the price you want?

Is it instantaneous though? I'm a recent comer, but don't the confirmations make transactions take anything from minutes to hours? Or is a further goal of BTC to reduce these transaction times? Thanks!

What's the most efficient way to sell one's B2X, assuming most people keep their BTC in a wallet? Send the BTC to an exchange pre-fork and hope you get credited your B2X, or just send B2X from the wallet (if the wallet supports it?) post-fork? Or other?

Complete beginner, considering dabbling with a few GBP, absolutely nothing serious.
Probably going to setup a Coinbase account, and buy some BTC through that. Can I "leave" my BTC there, or do I need to transfer it to a "wallet"? And what's the benefit of using a wallet over leaving it in Coinbase? Thanks!
