So does Canada according to that loser, so does anything that scares fascists.

Crazy how many bitcoiners embrace authoritarianism. Total disconnect there.

Joe Biden is garbage too, just because someone doesn't support trump doesn't mean they automatically support his opponents.
@_date: 2019-08-26 06:38:21
Cue butthurt trumpers who dont understand the subversive nature of bitcoin, or understand humor, or understand anything.

Again these are requirements that people put on these things that dont have to exist. We base our faith as Americans in capitalism on the fact that so far it has outlasted the greatest socialist experiments throughout history, but that goes against all the current observations of it's current deteriorations and impending economic turbulence. I feigned a little more lack of understanding of the meme than I really have, I get it. But that lies more along the ideology of pure communism, most socialists are realistic enough to understand that even if you desire a moneyless society, you will not achieve that without implementing a monetary system first. My point is, we should all try not to put so many requirements on our ideas of what it takes to create a better world.

America at this very moment is kidnapping and imprisoning innocent refugee toddlers. But ok, gulags, I'll keep them at the forefront of my thoughts because apparently that and socialism are inseparable concepts.

Ok but i think the USSR was real socialism, they did what they had to. What cliche do we go to from here?
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:17:31
Sure, they probably tend towards those things, I'm just saying there aren't these requirements that people put on them, there's nothing that makes tendencies into indisputable requirements. I know I'm talking about some utopian shit, just something to consider is all.
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:50:44
Super cool and original argument dude. The USSR was real socialism, now what?
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:04:29
I can see how hard you thought out this insightful and profound response, humbling.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:43:26
Right on

Look up libertarian socialism dude, they are not at odds, you are simply speaking on a subject you are not educated about.

Bitcoin is inherently socialistic in that it gives more economic control to the masses, not sure what this meme is trying to say.
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:27:02
Or should I say we may not, not will not, in the spirit of what I said.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:52:58
Libertarianism and socialism are not mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:23:33
Yea, libertarianism is in opposition to authoritarianism. Socialism is just an economic system. You can have a libertarian, or authoritarian socialist system.
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:27:29
There doesn't have to be a central authority in socialism, that's a misconception based on the tactics implemented mainly by the USSR in its particular time and circumstantial place in history. There could just as potentially exist a socialistic anarchy, theoretically, with only law dictating worker control of productive processes. That's all socialism is, worker control of productive processes and productive property, everything else is well, extra and/or other.

The lie I'm speaking of is that illegals currently get welfare benefits, they dont. I am surprised to see they all raised their hands. But I would imagine there would be some evidence for there being some kind of economic benefit from doing so if they are all on board with it. And I'm fine with that, the government should not govern from a principle of cruelty taking precedence over the well being of the citizenry first. If they think they can cover the citizenry, and then immigrants as well, so be it. In order for an "illegal" in this case to be covered, they would have to be in the system on the way towards legitimate citizenry first, anyway, I would imagine.

There's a few misconceptions here. America is probably at it's most unregulated capitalistic state it has been in in the last hundred years. It was strong unions and regulations that allowed a balance in the economy for it to become as great as it was at its economic peak. Those things are largely gone, as well as higher taxes on wealth. There are no current benefits for illegal immigrants, not from a traditional welfare perspective, and while there may be some politicians who are in favor of universal healthcare, it is not the majority, and even less so in regards to providing care for non citizens. That is a popular lie that seems to have been precipitated by the right wing media. Not saying liberal media doesn't push it's own sets of propaganda, it does, and I dont subscribe to any of it, but illegals by no means have it good. Hell, our own citizenry doesn't even enjoy the benefits of even the most meager welfare state policies seen throughout the rest of the developed world. The welfare state in America is its military, apparently it's ok as long as its purpose is to precipitate imperialistic goals and obtain foreign resources and assets.

What banks can you take a bucket of coins to and have them count it? Coinstars business model is based on convenience and saving time rolling coins.

Huh. I didn't know they did that.

How is that a problem though? It would be like buying free money.
