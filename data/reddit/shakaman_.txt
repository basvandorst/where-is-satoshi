Even if we do you'll find a way to lose money during it
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:13:35
Wow you must have made a killing then. If you can predict such a volatile market you must have become extremely rich. In a very short period of time
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:55:28
My favourites are the super specific ones.
64k on October 3rd at 2:54am, you heard it here first folks
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:06:52
If you think about how willing people are to spend money on the lottery (speaking about the UK here, no idea what its like worldwide), people will spend a few pounds a week for a almost 0 chance of winning. They basically spend the money to allow them to daydream about a life changing financial gain.
You can see bitcoin in the same way, just with much, much better odds. I accept that my money might be lost, and I view it as a considered gamble. But there's a chance (can't put a probability on it as easily as the lottery) that life changing money will come.
Good luck friends

USD are backed by the knowledge that you can buy BTC with them though
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:29:05
You're insufferable, good luck with the millions you must have made having been right so many times.
@_date: 2019-07-31 19:20:45
and nothing really happened
@_date: 2019-07-16 12:30:35
Put a significant amount of their cash in it. Not sure what % counts as significant but anything over 5 would be astounding
@_date: 2019-07-24 15:55:41
tl;dr: You've made some poor calls, some good ones, and now your going around bragging about the few good ones
@_date: 2019-07-31 06:40:55
Glad you've finally been specific about it. If we hit September and we've not gone down and stuck at 8k then will you finally shut up ?
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:18:14
Aren't you the guy that bought at 18k ?
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:11:08
Didn't see Hilary locked up, must have missed when that happened.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:25:35
think of the memes thats why
@_date: 2015-05-07 10:17:49
Why are you referring to them as TSA? He stated it was in Europe quite clearly
@_date: 2019-03-27 21:07:07
You can spend $1000 dollars on buying BTC or mining it. If you can get more just buying it, why would you mine it ? 
@_date: 2019-03-28 06:06:02
I'd ask myself why I installed a million dollar solar farm I had no plan / use for.
@_date: 2019-03-28 18:50:36


So you'd literally spend $$$ on electricity to mine to sell to end up with less $$$? What kind of strategy is that?
@_date: 2019-11-23 11:29:24
Thanks for your valued perspective mate
@_date: 2019-03-17 09:06:30


That's exactly why the guy said : "it matters how much you can buy", and specifically didn't say "it matters how much you have"
You're in agreement with him but trying to not be just because he's not on your side. Either that or you have poor reading comprehension
@_date: 2019-03-17 07:50:47
Jesus Christ can't you read? The comment you're replying to literally said "it matters how much you can buy"
@_date: 2019-08-01 11:13:09

We will what ???? Don't leave us hanging man
@_date: 2019-08-07 10:28:38
How do they buy at the exact bottom so well ?
@_date: 2019-08-05 06:40:54
Because your in the 00.01% of earth's population that would actually do this

"china bans bitcoin"
"bitcoin dead"

Well said comrade, they almost caught us there

Did you not see the jump to 12k??? Then the dump when they moved it one position right ???
@_date: 2019-08-08 06:22:17
You're insufferable mate
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:50:49
What's the syntax for withdraw
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:46:15
As BTC moves up the food chain deflation will occur
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:36:12
No, just then when Bitcoin is doing really well, sell a certain amount a week. Impossible to predict the exact peak but you can guess when your near/around it
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:50:58
@_date: 2019-10-18 05:41:47
Not sure if your being serious? Thankfully the internet is far more the web pages
@_date: 2019-10-18 05:02:59
I know I'm in the minority here but I think the internet might really catch on
@_date: 2019-08-06 09:57:10
We chillin up here now mate
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:52:53
Stick to the plan
@_date: 2019-10-21 15:01:07
The independent is left wing now ???
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:29:52
Fucksake why are you back ? Did you not realise you had no idea what you were talking about and left ? How stupid do you have to be to just show up again with your confidence not at all knocked
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:35:13
!lntip am I making my point yet
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:01:31
DCA. Even if we are on the way up it is probably going to be a rough ride
@_date: 2019-10-27 12:29:44
Ignore the incels on this board, glad you're enjoying life
@_date: 2019-10-22 05:37:48
Me, Wikipedia, and most of the UK must be then I guess
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:06:14
We're all gonna make it brahs

11414 boys lets go
@_date: 2019-06-01 09:52:48
Were all going to make it bro
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:52:38
Guys were not going to have any memes lined up for any price points at this rate.
@_date: 2019-06-06 19:55:10
Yeah and like £2
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:04:21
I want a dip just to let my btc boys in
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:14:05
Can someone define what controlling your private key means?
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:53:36
Yes. All bitcoin movements cost bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:46:12
I was just thinking about this the other day . People talk about DCA buying but not DCA selling
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:57:00
Yeah, people on here used to recommend much more heavily diversifying, with btc only part of a portfolio also containing stocks, maybe gold. Problem is that they have to keep withdrawing BTC to stay "diversified" and just losing future earnings in the process. Eventually people just stick to BTC
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:08:59
Meh, you've about as much chance just looking stupid when it goes up.
@_date: 2019-06-01 07:21:41
You can make similar excuses for gold loss prevention. Are you really this blind to not see how silly you sound?
BTC fraud comes from "exchanges getting hacked or scamming"
Sounds a lot like "You could easily be scammed with gold unless you are purchasing from a legit source."
Clown. And I'm saying this as someone with $0 in gold
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:01:18
I've not checked the prices but it must have been a great day of price rises for all involved
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:09:17
Lmao the level of analysis on this fucking sub
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:16:43
I'll be too busy taking btc out for a drink that night to post it
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:58:03
No one knows whats going to happen short term, the only idiots are the people that pretend they do
@_date: 2019-10-12 08:15:40
Thanks for letting me know
@_date: 2019-04-30 09:57:40
You'd surely either still be holding or would have sold ages and ages ago

When's the next moon shot? Asking for a friend
@_date: 2019-04-30 17:19:32
Appreciate your spelling and grammar advice, thanks very much.
I still stand my point. You say yourself that being paid daily would be the most appropriate, so it shouldn't surprise you that we just are different distances away from that.
@_date: 2019-04-30 17:01:52
The only weird thing is that your suprised the whole world doesn't work the exact same as america
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:24:45
Is this what you guys think whenever you purchase something ? Autists
@_date: 2019-04-30 17:03:45
We all have a finite time to live. We all have an optimum time to withdraw. If you're 80, have no one to leave your money to, and could be rich if you withdrew your BTC then the time is now
@_date: 2019-09-22 17:26:26
See you on the ides of march my friend
@_date: 2019-09-06 10:32:31
You've no idea what your talking about. Professional gamblers aim for 5-10%. Nearly all bets are placed at odds shorter than evens. You don't go to the casino to double your money, no one can do that reliably
@_date: 2019-09-15 09:08:34
I like stupid comments like this because it reminds me of the level of clowns that are on this subreddit and so I should ignore their bitcoin advice. You're whole post history is just you being a swarmy prick, get a life
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:33:11

And never check them. Just hodl!
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:10:08
I agree. Once your in max stake you can't really do anything else

Apparently she was offered a 28oz steak or a fried egg. She chose the egg
@_date: 2019-05-31 03:09:15
Is this going to happen every 1k? I imagine 10k will be a big barrier
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:44:27
If you can afford to never have the money ever again then yes.
