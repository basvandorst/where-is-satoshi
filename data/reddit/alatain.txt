Basically, you need to read up on the benefits and disadvantages of each altcoin. Looking at the way things are going currently, Litecoin does not really solve anything that is wrong with Bitcoin. Given that, it is a little more likely that if one of the two were to succeed, it would be the one with the most infrastructure already built. Right now, that is Bitcoin. Many more places accept Bitcoin versus Litecoin and that momentum will keep going until either Litecoin is abandoned, or a major flaw is discovered with Bitcoin. 
Effectively, it is a bet. People are buying Bitcoin because it is more likely to succeed. You can take more risk (and potentially more profit) by buying Litecoin but it is currently the underdog. You could also hedge your bets and buy a bit of both and see how it comes out.

I know you are being downvoted, but I would like to use this opportunity for a discussion, regardless of votes. 
If we take this political theory to the base, you are advocating that the government, in any sense (democratic, dictatorial, or otherwise) has control of a certain parcel of land. The control of this land then gives them the right to tax the people that are born on it. You can stop me here if my logic is wrong. 
If the number of people that live on the land outweighs the number of people who are willing to die defending the governing body's right to tax it (plus a coefficient that defines the technological advantage of the more advanced culture), does this invalidate the governing body? Does the government have a true right to govern?

It is a system of investment. You have to decide how much risk is acceptable for what level of reward. With Bitcoin, you have a large risk of completely losing all of your investment. You also have a commensurate level of reward that you could get from it. If you invest $1,000 and the value goes to $10,000 you have made a ten-fold return, but you made it due to the risk you took.
Litecoin, on-the-other-hand, is an even more risky investment. There is not only a chance that cryptocurrency fails in general, but the good chance that Bitcoin will dominate the field. That large risk comes with a large reward if the risk pays off. It is that way with a lot of investments. Do you buy expensive, but proven stocks, or do you take a chance on a new, risky stock in hopes that you get better returns.

Having a Vive and seeing the difference currently between the way the two headsets are managed, I would highly recommend at least checking out the Vive before deciding on the Rift. If having an open ecosystem means anything to you, I would not get the Rift. There is also the issue of not knowing what Oculus intends to do about roomscale interaction. 
I am not saying to not buy it. Just look into the alternatives if you have not already (or better yet try them both out first).

Right, but you cannot be suggesting that we fund criminal/terrorist groups in order to counteract their moves or expectations...? Right...?
I was more asking "how do we start a meaningful organization that is able to counteract the calculated movements of a well-established, multinational group". 
It is a very good start to say that there is a problem and we need to fix it. It is another issue to suggest viable ideas. In essence, how do we compete with them?

This is kind of a random thing that we were invited to. We met someone in Seattle at the Evening with Amanda Palmer and Neil Gaiman that we got invited to the Amanda Palmer kickstarter loft party.

They even helped me decide which one I wanted to go with.

You can tax transactions regardless of who made the money. I paid sales tax on the hot sauce I bought in Bitcoin. The U.S. just does the transactions in dollars, just like if I bought it with euros. 
In short, we can still be forced to pay taxes in Bitcoin just as we can with cash. Yes, we can get around it illegally. Cash can do the same.

Theoretically, they could bank on Bitcoin being worth more when they cash out the bitcoin that they receive than when they received it. That way you could get the bitcoin for the going rate, use money that they already have and then sell the bitcoin they received when the price is over what they agreed to accept it as... I am in no way sure that this is how they do it, but it would be one way to play with the risk of the situation.
-Edit- Minor changes for clarity.

The number of light bulbs that can be screwed in by one bitcoiner fluctuates according to demand. It is not known if the current rate is in a light bulb bubble or, if in the near future, we could get several thousand light bulbs screwed in per bitcoiner. 
You can, however purchase black market light bulbs on the Silk Road.

You should not buy bitcoin to get rich quick. If you believe that the concept could benefit the world and that it has a chance to work, then invest in it and use it. It will grow and become worth more (in total usability) as it does.
Ultimately the value of a bitcoin will be worth either $0.00 or it will capture a sizable portion of financial transactions and be worth a large amount. It really is an either/or situation.

The options are either, spend a bitcoin on the item and not replenish it from your bank o' fiat, spend a bitcoin on the item and then replenish your stock of bitcoin, or just spend USD. 
The way I see it, option one loses you hundreds of dollars of possible future money. Option two loses you the fee for converting the money into bitcoin, but spreads bitcoin usage. Option three saves you the small bank fee. The only bad option I see is one and that is only if Bitcoin survives and proliferates. If it does not, then spending it when it has value is the equivalent of cashing out without fees. 
I do not see how options two or three would lose you hundreds or thousands of future dollars. I could be not understanding your comment though.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:00:58
Arguably, paying for things in bitcoin generates positive press and interest in Bitcoin. This would cause more people to know about, and possibly start using it. That would cause your bitcoin to appreciate in value. 
I guess the question then becomes, why keep USD? The answer right now, of course is a hedge against the risk of Bitcoin failing, but that won't always be the case.

You are comparing different things. A physical in-person transaction with cash would be just a secure as a physical in-person transaction with Bitcoin. The difference being that the same money you use there can be used online, over the phone and internationally as well.

I am not being a moron. It is all a matter of perspective. Walmart, a company that takes credit, to many people is a less than credible business. This is because they are seen as seeking profit over the good of people in general. If a company chooses to take Bitcoin at this point, it humanizes them a bit and makes them seem a little more approachable. 
You can have scammers in any field. Bitcoin is the same as cash. Don't give your cash to someone that you do not trust. Same with Bitcoin. People forget, there are no chargebacks with cash either.

Bubbles are relative. The housing market hit a bubble. Is it worthless? People continue to trade in property, despite the fact that people improperly valued the housing market at one time. A new commodity was incorrectly valued. That does not mean it was value-less.

Exactly. The whole idea of relying on a personal and real connection between fans and artist is a great concept that far too many bands seem to be missing today. Amanda seems to have it down.
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:29:24
Yeah, news does tend to push the price up. I think currently we need the growth to be steady, but not too fast. If a big fish gets on board before the kinks in the system get ironed out, the ballooning use of Bitcoin will highlight the underdeveloped areas of the community and could lead to users loosing confidence in the system. 
It is so up in the air right now, it is amazing. This early in the game, the effects of even small events are magnified, rather like small changes in a vector can result in major changes in the end result. It is when a concept is in its infancy that the greatest contributions are made.

I intend to broach the idea with Amanda Palmer in June when I am at a house party with her. She has traditionally supported open music sharing and the idea of fans truly connecting with the musicians through the idea of tipping for the music. Passing the digital hat, as it were. It could be a good symbiotic relationship to join the Amanda Palmer fans with the Bitcoin community. (P.S. Amanda Palmer/The Dresden Dolls are a great band worth taking a look at)

God damn, more people need to understand this principle. Your money and patronage are the only real way you have of voting in a capitalistic society. If you like something, buy it. Pay what you feel it is worth. I am a huge fan of artists taking whatever fans feel/can give for a product. Most people that I have seen do this get more money than they would have gotten selling at a fixed, traditional price. Bitcoin is perfect for that set-up.
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:04:10
I actually see the blurred lines between commodity and currency as one of the more interesting things about Bitcoin. This is truly a grand experiment that pushes the bounds of the concept of money. The fact that we don't know exactly how it will end up is kind of the point.
As to whether there will be a crash, personally I feel that there is enough sustained interest and new buyers right now that any mass sell will be countered by people taking advantage of the lower price to buy in. This will buffer any long term loss. I hope...
