I did my last and only transaction with Kapiton in November just a few hours before the notice on the page about problems with deposits via wiretransfers, it took one week for the fiat to show up in Kapiton, I was fast and bought bitcoins and transfered everything to my wallet.

Not stupid idea there is just a slightly problem, people will not understand the QR-thing on the bottles just the beer! My kegerator keeps track of each users account via RFID, so you could scan your card or key or whatever with a RFID tag (EM4102) and a LCD display will show your unique QR-code which is a bitcoin address just for you. 
So the guests needs to understand which clients accepts paper wallets. I could make RFID cards which already have some Bitcoins linked with them which works with the kegerator but that will not make my guest use Bitcoin in real. 


I have been thinking of doing a DIY BTC ATM with thermal printer which prints paper wallets. But that's a later project.

Everything is depended on Bitcoin Core client, the client keep the accounts and addresses to the accounts. The default account the one which you get when you start up Bitcoin Core for the first time is the bank. 
When some one swipe their RFID card in my case the student identification card the Arduino will send a http request to a specific web server and search for labels of addresses (accounts) against Bitcoin Core via RPC with the RFID cards key ID as labe, if it exist the http server will respond with its balance which the web server gets from Bitcoin Core via RPC connection, and an second request will be done from the Arduino to get the bits for the QR-code which is generated in the webserver to be compatible with Mobile Phone Bitcoin clients. If there is no account it will create one with the RFID card key ID as label. 
So in fact the amount of the account is kept by the Bitcoin Core and everything is in bitcoin, if you decide to load the account with fiat it will withdraw the bank account and load "your" account with bitcoins. 
When you pour beer the flowmeter give pulses to the arduino and it will calculate the amount of beer and then withdraw that amount in bitcoin from "your" account to the bank, if the amount of beer calculated to the price in bitcoin per liter and if it is greater or the same as your balance the valve with kick in and stop the flow.

The main purpose of Bitcoin is, there is no central point or institution which controls the assets, no one can stop transfers to an adress, no one to freeze your assets and no one to confiscate anything which is yours. As long as the protocol is decentralised and no one with over 51% solving new blocks, there is no way to manipulate the currency.
I would hold my identity secret if I was the creator of a currency which could have so such impact that it can destroy or change the structure of finance, that the government and the banks goes hand in hand to issue and controlling the money. There is to much to risk, not in loss of Bitcoin but losing life. So "Satoshi" made the right decision to remain anonymous.
I have several banks but I can't transfer funds fast and easy between them, it takes 1 day or more. 
About the transparency, there is a bigger transparency in Bitcoin than all other currencies. You can review all the transactions in the blockchain, you can se all the amount which is on each addresses. With ordinary currencies I'm not so sure if I trust them anymore, how do I know that the currency is not being manipulated by people with insight and power?

@_date: 2014-01-12 16:03:11
With google you can find, many wallet clients for both mobile and desktop have qr code generator. 
For phones there is multiple clients for that. It depends of how you want to store the coins, in the phone or within the cloud?
**The cloud:** Keep a backup of your wallet, if the service disappear or you lost access to your account.
 blockchain.info does have an app which you have you use with their service
Coinpunk: 
**Storing on the phone:** Important you have to backup your wallet, not only on the phone. If your phone get stolen or lost or it totally breaks you need to have a backup somewere else. 
Bitcoin wallet 
Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet 
Most desktop clients have support for QR-code generation, otherwise you can use websites.

I think this is a geographical issue, from which country you are from and live in. In some countries taxes are for some good for the society, like free education, free healthcare or other services which can provide for a safer society. 
So there comes the taxes, why not provide something back to the society if you are using those services. It isin't only services, there are also things in the society which cost much like building infrastructure. 
All these stuff differs allot from country to country of how the taxes is used and being wasted.
But there is always free riders who'm just want to get as much as they can but never giving back anything. 
But my point of view would change dramatically if I was living in a country where I pay taxes but never see something from it later.

The company had bad routine!  they could have secured their mail with PGP Cards such as Yubikey NEO and have an internal routine to sign every e-mail with PGP, so when the hacker tried to send an unsigned e-mail they would recognize it as an e-mail from not the right person. 
The company with bad routine cannot blame US Marshals because they would have been social engineered anyway some time in the future!

I'm down about $100 but that's much because I have been using my bitcoins, and lucky I haven't been so fast in buying back my coins, so instead I have been buying back once a week with smaller amounts. For example I bought Beer and Burgers in Berlin this summer for about 350 mBTC but bought it back during 3 weeks two month later. By doing that I earned $15. It's been like that since i started using my coins but buying it back later. It's all about make a smaller risk by using them but always buy more Bitcoins for a longer period instead of buying everything at once.

In the world of bitcoin it is the sender (customer)  which sets a fee, he/she could broadcast the transaction with a 0  fee but that would make the transaction to be verified longer time or maybe never. If the customer decides to set a higher fee the transaction will be verified faster. So there is only a optional fee for the sender.

In Sweden, the 6 major banks have together set up a company called Getswish AB which is making and holding the service for the app Swish, for instant transfer of SEK between persons,  payments to companies. The payment system is based on phone numbers so your address is your cell phone number. For companies they have created specific numbers started with 123 so you will recognize that it is a company. There is no QR-codes no NFC just manual typing of digits or browsing through your phonebook in the phone.
Available in App Store, Google Play or Windows Store
And people in Sweden have started to use it regular the last two years. A survey (Insight Intelligence) shows that 51% of all swedes are using Swish. Information from Getswish AB shows that during August 2015 4 billion SEK where transferred through Swish. So yes in Sweden which is a part of Europe, people are adapting to Mobile phone payments between persons. Payments in physical stores are still done with Visa/master-cards

Whenever I can pay with Bitcoin I will do that because it is easier, it is a struggle to bring up the card write the numbers I never remembers and hope that the payment will succeed, some times I missed a number or what ever. So when I see that I can pay with Bitcoin the process is much easier just bring up the phone scan a QR-code and it is instant.
