I remember hearing people say that in 2013.

All funds confirmed before the fork are safe. The only risk is with receiving funds once the fork starts but before it is clear what the outcome is.

Not necessarily. It's important to understand that segwit doesn't magically fit more transactions in less space, but instead fits some part of each transaction into a separate datastructure outside the block (and then add a rule saying (block data size) + (segwit data size)/4 &lt;= 1MB).
Which lets you make ~1.7MB blocks happen as a soft-fork, but everyone's actually transmitting ~1.7MB of data.
So when combining SegWit with an actual block size bump, you can do any rule you want:
1. (block data size) + (segwit data size)/4 &lt;= 2MB). Leads to ~3.5MB if everyone upgrades to use SegWit, 2MB otherwise.
2. (block data size) + (segwit data size) &lt;= 2MB). Blocks are capped at 2MB regardless of SegWit uptake.
3. (block data size) + (segwit data size) &lt;= 4MB). Blocks are capped at 4MB regardless of SegWit uptake.
And so on. Which one you prefer depends on whether you're trying to cap bandwidth burst usage or UTXO usage per block.

Watch the bitcoin news (especially about new software releases) in the next couple of days.
You'll know what to do.

I believe API access (like the one used by mobile apps) would let you see it.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:19:43


False. The best estimate of actual transaction increase is closer to 1.6 - 1.75 MB.
4MB is for a block full of 15-of-15 multisig transactions. It will not happen in reality.

Raw up-down vote counts, without fuzzing.
I see what you were asking now.

The alternate history of this (Gavin not giving up lead maintainership) would be very different, I suspect.

That is impossible for 2 reasons:
- SPV wallets do not check every block (by definition, they only check the headers), so it is impossible for them to notice if the rules have been loosened.
- Miners can impose arbitrary additional rules on which transactions and blocks they consider valid without telling anyone. This means even a full node cannot in theory know that it is checking all the same rules as the miners. This is what allows soft-forks to work at all.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:39:29
That'd be wrong, as you can just shove a pair of 1MB-each data-laden transactions using OP_RETURN to bloat size and bam, 2MB block.
It wouldn't be _useful_ for scaling tx/s but it would be bigger than the 1MB limit.
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:03:13
And [co-founded]( it.
@_date: 2016-02-28 22:58:22
Your fee per byte is ~10 satoshis per byte. right now there's a 17MB backlog with an average fee of ~12 satoshis per byte.
If no one sent new transactions, you'd get confirmed in around 9 blocks or so.
Since that's not the case it will probably take until sometime tonight for the backlog to clear and for your transactions to get confirmed.

Can be done as a soft-fork


Can be done as soft-fork or without any fork at all depending on the flavor


can be done as a soft-fork (extension block à la SegWit)

XThinBlocks works for blocks with transactions you already have in your mempool. It limits data re-transmission.
This approach doesn't decrease total data transmission but it does 2 things:
1. Allow a node to re-transmit before it even has the full block.
2. Make block transfer work over UDP and from multiple peers in parallel.
My hunch is that this would help initial sync (bitcoin currently has trouble with saturating your connection). And 2) might help with the great firewall (but that's not a guarantee). This actually predates thin blocks by a bit (from back in september). Not sure why it's suddenly on the front page today.

The block size could be proved by providing the left and right paths of the merkle tree. It'd be pretty compact O(log(n)).
@_date: 2016-02-05 23:24:50
Right, nevermind then.

Core has a "max data/day" setting in 0.12 (I think).
XT has an implementation of bandwidth limiting more similar to what you'd see on bittorrent.

Certain types of fraud proofs (specifically the block reward being bigger than inflation subsidy + fees) are the size of the whole block.

It's worth noting that the original schedule for the segwit2x miners was to start signalling July 21st.

No, clock930 is wrong. Quoting myself from another thread:
















@_date: 2017-07-18 00:42:31
TL;DR, regular ASICBoost isn't stopped by SegWit. Regular ASICBoost also leaves clear evidence of having been used, and we haven't seen those traces on the mainnet.
There is a specific variant of ASICBoost that isn't as easily spottable, and someone accused Bitmain of using this "covert ASICBoost", and that their opposition to SegWit was because of that.
Now, that's largely nonsense for at least a few reasons:
1. SegWit stops this covert form but not the overt one, or other covert forms.
2. Including SegWit TX is entirely optional for a miner, so Bitmain could still use their covert ASICBoost if they wanted to.
3. The covert ASICBoost would still leave traces (due to merkle branch flipping), and no one's been able to identify any such thing.
4. Bitmain is voting to activate SegWit right now.
Bitmain is the biggest miner and has been at loggerheads with Core for a while about how the network should grow. That has earned them ire, but so far it's largely innuendo, not actual misdeeds.
Here I'll give you a head start on the next line of attack you'll hear. In 2 weeks when segwit2x locks in segwit for real, people will start talking about how Bitmain (and some other big miners) are pushing for a hardfork in order to eventually do one or more of the following:
- Increase the coin supply past 21M.
- Enforce KYC/AML on all transactions.
- Push smaller miners out of business.
- Roll back SegWit.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:38:22


I'm not sure where you got that idea. Miners don't care a ton either way about SegWit on a revenue level. Some like it, some don't, but either it's not fundamentally going to change their business model (especially since they can always decide not to include any SegWit tx in their blocks at all, should it be harmful to them).
The UAHF thing that Bitmain threatened to do was always meant to be a counter to BIP148 wiping out the main branch. SegWit2x activating before August 1st means this won't be an issue at all.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:01:00
bit1 is mandatory, everyone is setting it.
bit4 is now optional (and does nothing), not all miners are setting it.
However, almost all of the miners not signalling bit4 are still putting NYA in their blocks and that's probably a better indicator of who's supporting 2x (as it directly references the agreement).
 tracks the NYA flags.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:39:23
Once step 2 starts, you should see them signal for bit-1 (segwit) and on bit-4 at the same time, yes. Also they'll be orphaning non-signalling blocks.
It doesn't guarantee anything about future actions, but it would effectively stop the UASF nodes from forking off (effectively the majority of hashpower would already be orphaning non-bit-1-signalling blocks, which is exactly what UASF would be trying to do).
At which point Bitmain's *contingency plan* is not necessary, since there is no UASF fork threatening the main chain with a wipeout of all blocks/transactions.


Bitmain's hard fork code is not BitcoinABC. BitcoinABC says it implements the UAHF spec, but that is a spec that they wrote themselves, there's 0 guarantee that it matches what Bitmain implemented on their end.
