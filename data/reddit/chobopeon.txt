I mentioned that in the article. I still think this is an important topic because people talked so much about it but at the end, I may clear that all you have to do is start coding yourself and name your work whatever you want.

is there anything online about it to read?
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:06:51
I'd like to hear more.
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:17:23
what's the source of this screenshot?
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:50:40
interesting, is there anywhere to read about this?

It was a minor crash in reality but the main thing I'm addressing is the perspective people had on it. In that respect, it was a "crash" if you catch my meaning. 
There were a lot of doomsayers in the hours after SR fell, so it's really interesting to me to see how quickly the recovery took place.

of all the criticisms of american imperialism, this has to be the most boring and useless one.

note sure I agree. Almost any American, from the most provincial to the most metropolitan to the most globalized, refers to the this country as "America" a large percentage of the time. It's in the name of the country,  it's often as simple as that

that's weird. if you feel like, you should send tell the people at info so they can look into it. shouldnt be getting any alarms.
if you dont feel like it, thats understandable too! :]

A good point! It's noted at the end of the article.
Anyway, don't take this as an attack on bitcoin, merely a statement of fact about the security of certain btc operations.

The price shot up the minute the news was announced which happened before the actual hearing, so I'd say people give a shit! Can't say for sure though.

i'll just pre-write that $1000 headline now

Expensify pays in bitcoins if the employee requests it. I used it as a freelancer for several months earlier this year. Insert obligatory "now only if I had ticked off the bitcoin box..." comment here.

the article says the currency has "many other uses", what's the problem?
@_date: 2013-06-27 05:50:25
huh? they've been around for a few months. is that "a while"?
@_date: 2013-10-18 13:24:40
it's a shortening of the otherwise long name of our country. there isn't anything necessarily nefarious in calling the usa "america" and I think it's one of the more eyeroll-worthy complaints anyone has about this country, especially when there are so many more worthy targets for scorn.
@_date: 2013-10-18 13:57:15
people often prefer to speak in real words instead of acronyms. again, nothing nefarious about this and, as someone who often says "america" referring to the united states, i promise i'm not trying to insult any other country in the hemisphere.

if i could have included the mspaint bitcoin wizard in the article, i would have!

Well, I'm making the connections as best I can. One of the big reasons I made this connection is because when it passed $600 12 hours ago was exactly when the Bloomberg article (which came out when the timing happened and WAY before the hearing actually started) came out saying that US agencies called it legit. When I say exactly, I mean that big jump early in the day ( came almost instantly after the publication of the article (which, again, was before the hearing itself).
The US news obviously isn't everything with today's rise but I have to respectfully disagree when you assert that it has so little to do with it. The timing really suggests the news mattered.

we have the word america in our country's name, it's inevitable that we'll shorten the otherwise long name and call our country america. we recognize that north and south america are ALSO called america. there are things called synonyms in language and it's not an imperialistic insult when we use them.
seriously, there are so many stronger ways to attack "america"'s imperialism, so please cut your own bullshit and get to something more useful, huh?
@_date: 2013-10-18 14:22:58
if you try so hard to be insulted, it's going to happen regardless of my intention.
