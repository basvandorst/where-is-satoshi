This TX is 3+ weeks old, can you give it a try please?
Thanks! And will sign-up to your site when I’m not in mobile.

Hmmm. Am I understanding thins right, that if you’ve made a previous very low fee transaction that hasn’t gotten verified for ages; that a simple way of speeding it up is to just send 100% of your BTC balance to one of the still-empty receive addresses in your HD wallet?
*assuming that part of your total balance resides in an unconfirmed transaction of a change address

The people who had BTC sitting in GDAX during the August 1st fork are scheduled to get their BCH on Jan 1st, 2018.
If they behave the same way this fork, then you shouldn’t get it until around April 2018?

I use both. But Bitfinex if you want your B2X coin to be reflected in your balance faster than the other exchanges.

Here’s a mobile option: If you have an unrooted iOS device, the app BreadWallet is a good one. If you have an unrooted Android, the app MyCelium is even better. Make sure your mobile devices stay malware free.

Arranged from best option to least:
Hardware wallet &gt; paper wallet &gt; software wallet &gt; Bitfinex &gt; Binance or Bittrex

Bitcoin Gold doesn’t happen until around 60 hours from now, so go ahead and do it. Better do it soon though in case the confirmations take a long time.

My first choice would be to move it to a wallet where you have control of your own private keys.
If you really want to move it to an exchange because you want to sell the forked coin, Bitfinex. They were the first exchange to give users their respective BCH during the Aug 1 fork, and these users were the only ones able to sell their BCH for as high as 0.26 BTC per 1 BCH. 
By the time most people were able to deposit their BCH in other exchanges like Bittrex, it was trading lower than 0.07BTC per 1 BCH. *(Bittrex required 20 confirmations for BCH deposits, and less than 20 BCH blocks were mined a day at that time.)*
Last and most important, don’t leave your coins dormant in an exchange.

That’s how you know she’s a keeper. :)

Additional info: I also use Binance by the way, and after reading the linked thread below, I’m seriously considering dumping Bittrex and just moving my short to mid term positions to Binance.

Your Electrum wallet that had lots of key pairs is called an HD wallet - Hierarchical Deterministic. Those series of words that Electrum asked you to write down are all that you need to fully restore your wallet, meaning all the public-private key pairs in there. *(you don’t need to back up the individual key pairs)*
Strictly speaking, a paper wallet usually just means a single public-private key pair, but that key pair will work exactly the same as a single pair in an HD wallet. 
Try this so you’ll feel confident that you only need to write down the seed words: create an Electrum wallet, send it some BTC, delete the wallet, then restore your wallet using the seed words. The BTC that you sent it will still be there.
