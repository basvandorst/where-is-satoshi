Wait actually, these are futures. An agreement between two parties to buy and sell a bitcoin at a future date for a price set today. So you can agree today, that you will sell someone a bitcoin in the future. If the price goes down and you're the seller, you do well, because you agreed to a higher price that the buyer now needs to pay. And vise-versa if the price goes up. You lock in a price today for the future.

I mean, they're just Motherboard. They don't have an axe to grind or a horse in the race...

What's 2019 setup then?
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:41:33
Are you okay?

Wait what? Maybe I misunderstand short-selling, but if you short, you sell in to the market (with a bitcoin you don't own) but then you later buy back. You sell when you think the price is high and buy back later when you think the price is lower...

I had this happen to me too. Send it to my old circle account. Couple hundred bucks worth. Still very confused by it!
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:06:18
Yes indeed �� on all fronts

Is there a scourge of bots on Reddit or something? You know, Motherboard, the new website?

Lightning is here. What's next?
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:55:45
If lighting is 2018, what's 2019?

I miss when the sub want obsessed with fueding with another sub. Totally misses the point of bitcoin

100% agreed. The idea that this is the reason for the sends is silly. It's possibly accidental or some weird proof-of-burn maybe.

"It's what Simoleons ought to be: E-money that is totally private from the eyes of government."
Excellent quote!
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:31:04
Yeah, that's probably true
@_date: 2018-03-01 05:08:06
Those are good reasons. I'll check it out

A fun little story
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:24:29
Why is that? What are the features that make it better?
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:37:44
They do offer a lot of different funding options with different time options. I'm opting for Bank Draft. Slow but also low fee
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:34:58
Focus on features like MAST. Not price, not bch, not Roger. Features will win, nothing else matters. Everything else will follow
