I think the trick here is that the concept of 'utility' is basically circular. If I am willing to work/sacrifice/pay money for something then you infer that it has utility. What other way is there besides this to measure utility?
This may seem like nitpicking but these are foundational concepts for economics. Imagine if physics were based on this type of circular logic...
Don't get me wrong. I'm a big fan of Bitcoin--just not of economics.

Bitcoin is not like an internet company. Bitcoin is like the internet itself. 
This is not about tribalism. That is an empty propaganda term. This is about decentralization, which is an objective and technical topic. Objectively, the BCH path leads to centralization and the death of what makes this network so promising. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 03:02:57
Fair enough. 100mb is not too bad. I should have used a larger number. The point is that to actually work as a global internet of money, we need many, many times that.  Layered solutions are the way to go, not larger blocks. Larger blocks lead to centralization. Is this not obvious?

Except that in this case it is a zero sum game. BCH is literally seeking to replace bitcoin. They claim to be 'the real bitcoin'. If BCH succeeds, then bitcoin will have been centralized and be in a position to get shut down by state actors. BCH is an attack on bitcoin and by extension decentralized networks in general. 
I've always found it curious that the main proponents of BCH all have criminal records. Decent chance that they're being blackmailed in some way.

From my perspective, what is most glaring is that Roger failed to address a single valid point raised by Jimmy. For example, the fact that bcash is propped up by a small group of elites with ulterior motives(bitmain, roger, etc) and not by a distributed community as in bitcoin. Roger's rebuttal was 'there are arguments in the bcash community, therefore it is decentralized'. Like, 'Calvin argues with Jihan who argues with Craig so we have a healthy and vibrant decentralized community.' Besides this he addressed basically nothing Jimmy said and stuck to his godawful infinite loop of rhetorical talking points

I think you're right about that being one of Roger's points. I've only heard him repeat that one about 100x. Literally about 100x.

Neuroscientist here. One of my specialties is the neural basis of 'value'. I used to scan people's brains while we gave them money under different conditions. Later I switched to focusing on the computational role of the brain's 'reward circuitry' in generating behavior. 
The short answer is that the whole concept of 'value' is circular and misses the entire point of how goal-directed behavior works. The concept is a relic. 
There is no such thing as 'intrinsic value' or 'subjective value' or even 'action value'. There is only the pursuit of internally defined goals, which are interconnected and constantly shifting in very complex ways. This is one of the reasons that economists are so puzzled by the 'irrational' behavior of economic agents--because economists fundamentally do not understand behavior. Very safe to ignore people like Krugman, who are pseudoscientists at best. 
But money is real, and money must have (store) value in the mathematical sense of the word. In it's most basic sense money is just an intermediary/record of exchange shared by a group. Because of it's unique properties, Bitcoin has huge potential in this regard.

Depends on whether the person is hungry, a vegetarian, rich, etc. There are common processes that occur in all goal directed behavior regardless of the goal, but then there are also different processes that define the different goals and why they are being pursued in the first place.

I have studied the neural basis of 'intrinsic value'--literally I have scanned peoples brains while they performed tasks for money--and there is just no way of escaping the conclusion that the economic concept of value does not map onto reality. 
Ultimately there is no such thing as 'value'. There is only the behavior. Animals will behave in whatever ways are necessary to maintain their internal state relative to what is required to continue surviving, etc. This process--goal directed behavior--is why we as animals have a nervous system in the first place. Understanding this process is one of the greatest challenges in science, and economics is not even remotely up to this task.

I'm advocating skepticism, not blind support. I haven't seen enough evidence either way to form a solid opinion as to his murder for hire charges. I'm simply providing a counterpoint to the 'didn't he hire people to kill someone why are you people supporting him' narrative that most people just repeat over and over again. In the absence of enough evidence, the correct posture is skepticism. Do you not agree?
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:40:13
Actually, this is not the present trend. Most AI is concerned with solving practical problems and not with actually modeling the nervous system.
Also, the Turing Test is a stupid test for intelligence. Using the Turing Test to determine whether or not something is intelligent is like tasting how sweet something is to determine whether or not it is sugar.  If you really want to make synthetic sugar, then you absolutely have to start with an understand of the structure of the sugar molecule and work from there. 
By the same logic, the real test for intelligence is whether a system works according to the same principles as an actual nervous system. And if you want to build a truly intelligent system, then this is the place to start. There's nothing mysterious or impossible about this, and it is absolutely inevitable. We are actually much, much closer than most people suspect. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:58:35
If there is enough evidence to form an opinion, then there should have been enough evidence to charge him for the crimes--especially considering how important they've been in the court of public opinion. It seems pretty clear to me that the murder for hire charges are an effective barrier to Ross garnering any public sympathy. He's never going to get a pardon until these charges are addressed. This strikes me as pretty unjust. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:11:13
I really don't think that's true. A lot of the bitcoiners I know (including myself) do genuinely believe this stuff. What OP wrote is just an expression of that belief.

@_date: 2019-02-22 19:40:56
As the network grows the price will stabilize and there will be less incentive to hold. We are still in the phase of potentially rapid growth. The system is still taking off and not yet at cruising altitude. Once this phase is over and Bitcoin has matured, then I can't wait to use it for payments. Knowing the price explosion that will occur if it becomes mainstream, why on earth would I be trying to get rid of it? How is that rational behavior?
Bitcoin is the internet of value transfer. By holding and accumulating we are increasing the value being stored by the network, which increases the overall usefulness of the network. This is an important service that we perform.

There is a famous study where they tried to train raccoons to earn and spend coins. They would get coins and then drop them in a box to get food. The experimenters discovered that raccoons did fine if they only had one coin at a time to spend, but as soon as they got two coins at once they would just rub them together and not spend them. Apparently this has to do with some hardwired 'food washing' behaviors that raccoons have. So raccoons are natural hodlers, and this painting is weirdly appropriate.

Relax my dude. We're all friends here. 
I think the idea behind stress testing is to determine the outer limits of performance, not performance under typical conditions.

Bitcoin should not be confused with legacy style political camps. I think it's the foundation of something entirely new and much bigger and weirder than anyone suspects.

He should check out Wall Street. Lots of social benefit there.

I used to do research in 'neuroeconomics', which is basically the study of how the brain assigns value to perceptions. The field is a mess because of confusion over the concept of value, which is essentially circular and not based on any real first principles of behavior.
I see a lot of similarity between current thinking on value and how people thought about gravity before it was formally described by Newton--they used to say that the falling object was just going to its 'natural place'.  It sort of makes sense, but if you look really closely you can see that it falls apart.

Bitcoin and cyborgs. It's all going to happen. You'll see.

When people compare Bitcoin to the internet I am reminded of stuff like this. Did people paint internet fan art when the internet was first getting started? This kind of strange obsession (no judgement, I'm guilty too) is what makes me think that the Bitcoin revolution will be a lot faster and a lot more intense than the internet revolution. Bitcoin hits closer to the heart of what makes people tick. It's going to be explosive.

If you can clearly define 'value', let alone 'intrinsic value', I will be extremely impressed. 
We may as well be arguing about 'intrinsic goodness' or 'intrinsic beauty'. These are fundamentally unscientific concepts and if you let them lead your thinking then you will get lost.

This is perfect. That first guy embodies the true spirit of Satoshi.

Never say never. We're in for some weird times ahead. I wouldn't rule anything out.

I wore a low key bitcoin shirt in whole foods recently and I noticed that women paid more attention to me. Maybe it was the shirt itself. Maybe I just acted cooler because of the shirt. Hard to tell.

I wouldn't be so dismissive. There are a lot of very clear parallels here.

This is like that scene in Gremlins where they take over the house and accidentally catch each other on fire and smash everything. Or maybe that's Gremlins 2, I can't remember

Imagine if you were blind and the only information you got about what was happening around you was from a 'journalist'....

Not only is there no such thing as 'intrinsic value', but the entire concept of value is circular. Think about it. Do you eat an apple because it has value, or does it have value because you eat it?

He likens buying bitcoin to trading turds. He may not understand it, but he has clearly picked his 'side'.

Your summary is cute and it would be great if it seemed like you were actually interested in the truth, but yeah, it's hard to take snarky condescending bullshit like this seriously

You couldn't pay me to wear this thing in public. Besides the fact that it's a security hazard and overpriced (and ugly), the whole thing is such a clear cynical marketing ploy. How stupid do they think we are?
If you want to blow some bitcoin on a nice watch get a Grand Seiko or something
