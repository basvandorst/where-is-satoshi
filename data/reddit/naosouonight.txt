I really hope you are joking.

Credit card is debt. Don't gamble money you don't have, dude. If you threw everything you had into bitcoin that is already dangerous enough, don't get credit to toss even more in.

This isn't assets, mate.
PM me your name so I never accidentally hire you, please.

Exactly. I mean, who even would use a currency that fluctuates like this as mainstream currency. At the very least, for it to become mainstream, they would have to make its value much more stable and if that happens, what would the difference between one and the other be?
Imagine using 1 dollar worth of bitcoin to buy something and in the next day that 1 dollar would now be worth 100 dollars. Or imagine you selling something worth 100 dollars in bitcoin but in the next day that 100 dollars is worth 1. 
People should treat Bitcoin as stock shares, not dollar bills.

I mean, to be completely fair, that was less about people not knowing the value of gold and more about people not beliving it was a real gold bar.
If someone was offering me a free gold bar in the middle of the street I too would be skeptical at best.

If I had bought BC back when they were 100 dollars a pop, I'd have sold 80% of it when it first hit 10k and just risked/played around with the 20% and I'be happy with that. Even if everything crashed and burned afterwards, I'd still leave with more than I had when I went in.
Easy 800% profit.

Pretty sure he is talking about the "worthless fiat scam paper".
