Look at the current buy orders on your exchange of choice. If you’re happy with that price then you can instantly sell your BTC for fiat currency. 
In Australia the cash withdrawal would then take 1-3 business days depending on your bank. It’s probably around the same in the US. Then head on down to your nearest bank or atm and withdraw.

If I’m looking at this correctly you were down $312 so you sold 40 BTC at a loss? 
If this is true my condolences to you.  It it’s not too late to get back in we are all still early adopters!

I’ve been using BTC Markets and it’s great. Fees start at 0.8% but lower as you transact more. The only downside is that you are limited to depositing 2k aud per day until you transact more.

I’m fully verified and can only bpay 2k. There is a link to ‘raise your deposit and withdrawal limit’ but when I tried it says I need to transact more.

That’s weird, I’m verified and my BPAY and POLi limits are both only 2k. My AUD withdrawal limit is 8k. 
Maybe your 30 day trading volume is higher?

It would be way easier to get a VPN and buy from an overseas exchange. 
In fact you could literally fly overseas, make the transaction and then fly back home and still save money.

BTC Markets are all I’ve used. Even with a new account you can transfer 8k aid or per day.
