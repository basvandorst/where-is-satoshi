Is there anything I can do to speed this up? Now I know not to give such a low fee. thats what I get for not realizing how much higher fees have gotten over the past few years :/

Oh god, I was so close to loosing almost a whole bitcoin back in the day by using inputs.io. Literally like 3 days before the incident, I realized that my bitcoin address I had was not showing any balance, and I realized that they did a "shared pool" of bitcoins where basically everyone's balance was all handled server side and not on the blockchain, so I felt a little creeped out and cashed out

I'm not commenting on speculation of the price of bitcoin, but at OP's current state, they have around 5000 dollars worth of bitcoin, sold at around the current rate. That alone would be a slight target for criminals
Beanie babies were kinda cheap back then, and also would have been much harder to steal, while someone can simply get a copy of someone's wallet and then steal all their bitcoins, without having to break into their house and such.

Aw, thanks for noticing it :D That subreddit has really been collecting in the dust, I would try to add more content/make the css a bit more presentable, but if only I wasnt so busy lately

Perhaps the smaller blockchain/faster transactions?
And now it just sounds like you are trolling

You literally just restated your last point and didnt even seem to listen to &gt; A currency's success is best measured by its price. 
And by your standards, the cryptocoin 42 coin is a much better coin than bitcoin due to its price being around 20 bitcoins? and dogecoin, being towards the bottem due to its low price? Its mainly volume and popularity, dogecoin has a low price but a LOT of coins(and a goodish volume), while 42 coin for example has a high price but a small amount of coins(also a fairly low volume unfortuantly)

FFFFF **IMAGE NSFL** someone disembowled, uggg why would you do this! Right before I go and take an exam now I have this mental image in my head :(

Dude ,you really sound like you have bigotry towards anyone who uses any other cryptocurrency
Why are you posting in this post about dogecoin if you hate it so much?
And as the saying goes "Dont put all your eggs in one basket" Remember when bitcoin's price plummeted while dogecoins price rose? would you rather have all bitcoin in that case or spread out your investments in different cryptocoins that are stable/ rising incase if one drops in price?
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:49:43
Wouldnt it be better to have diverisification incase of a drop in price/ have different coins cater to different needs?

The "average users here now" only shows people actively in the subreddit, it doesnt count people accessing the front page only, and might not show mobile devices accessing the subreddit

Yeah, Dogecoin's is pretty good, which is based on Litecoin's is pretty good, which is based on Bitcoin's which is also pretty good.

Didnt Reddit have something like that in the works, but ended up just scrapping it fairly quickly?

What Tim Cook means is that Apple could write the software(Read, a special version of iOS with this software included) to unlock any phone once you update the phone to that special OS.
It doesnt exist currently because Apple never plans on making it, and it never will exist without apple's consent because all iphones need to phone back home to apple to verify iOS updates to make sure they are legitimate(usually to stop people from downgrading their iphone's OS or installing already jailbroken versions of iOS)

Time machine works wonders: a backup every hour and saves the changes between each back up.
