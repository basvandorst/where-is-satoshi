Agree with you however the fact that people buy for money is necessary for mainstream. Moreover, the mass does not need to understand it to end up using it. This is the only way to make people download a wallet start using it and get slowly get use to smth we will have forever

Great idea I'll start smoking to do the same

I see your point but I see those 2 use cases at least as important! 
transferring and storing relatively big amount of money is good for those who have it!
But we have to think about the billions poor that could benefit to be included in a bigger economy with a strong currency that doesn’t risk hyperinflation!
So I’d say for me micro/nano fees and instant transactions are 2nd place this to increase use cases drastically but technically we are not ready!

He can sell at 50k easily
