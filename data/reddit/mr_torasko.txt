At $10,000 perhaps? :P

We're trading pretty flat right now, which indicates to me that a period of consolidation is coming short term. During this term altcoins will probably start rising, after which - when the rising wedge succeeds - new highs for Bitcoin will be achieved. Shorters are getting squeezed left and right, holders of altcoins are selling for BTC at this moment. I'm enjoying my time at the moment.

Why would you say they become increasingly irrelevant? I would say that when exchanges add fiat pairs (like Binance will be doing with the euro this year), it would make BTC increasingly irrelevant. Also keep in mind that altcoins usually rise with BTC, or after BTC. Likely the latter is the case this time, but we have to see about that. Not starting any arguments here, but I'm genuinely interested in your opinion.

And what would said algorithm be? I don't think it has been invented yet. :)

That probably won't happen super short term as we need some healthy consolidation first in the next few days. After that, I'm all for it!

Fair enough, thanks for your insights.

This doesn't make any sense. Transactions fees will get much lower thanks to second tier scaling / solutions. How can these fees be the only source of income for miners and still be profitable in a time when no new coins are generated?

Happy to hear. Now go and buy some more.

This is a part of my point exactly. A switch to something like Proof of Stake, for example how Ark is doing it, seems like the only way out.

Sure, but first some consolidation in the next few days. Hyperbolic rises are almost never a good sign for mid- to long-term price action.

Thank you, that's much appreciated. :)
