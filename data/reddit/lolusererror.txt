It’s just a internet variation of hold...as in, “Don’t sell!”

There actually seems to be better posts at r/CryptoCurrency but you have to wade through all the alt-coin hype.

Had a 2k USD I could invest a few months ago, but the wife was nervous about crypto so I only bought $200 worth of BTC...the regret is real.
On the up side, she has since agreed to let me keep buying BTC with part of our monthly income, so now I’m looking forward to 100k

It’s never wrong to hold

You’d likely get 48 hours or so before the internet found out and started trying to exploit it.

Can we stop....
I haven’t got my tax return back, and I’m going to use it to buy a whole coin....unless it goes up too much further.

I just got around to buying in...
Due to my busy schedule and nearby BTC ATM, I just decided to swing buy after work and buy. I've been aware of BTC since the beginning, but am just now in a place to actually start buying some. 
Anyway...with the thinking of "it's never to late to buy in," and "if I buy now I will be doing well in 5-10 years when BTC is $10k or more," I went to the ATM and bought in. 
It was September 1 and I bought at almost $5k....still trying to keep the long term future in mind. 
Keep on HODLEN on.
