These polls might not represent the current state. 1. Users filling them out are probably more likely users that are enthusiastic about bitcoin. 2. These polls (at least the lendedu ones) where conducted in august and (mid) november. The big hype train and influx of people happened later. I can't back it up in numbers but I think that the percentage of people with little to no knowledge about the technology is significantly higher during latest wave of investors (early december) joining in.

I agree with what you're saying but you just mention that the alternative provided by the guy in the video doesn't work in the long term. What about the concerns with the lightning network? I too would like to hear someone address them. The LN leading to more centralization is pretty obvious and undisputable. LN is something that has to be the ideal solution because it's what's being relied on in terms of scalability yet I see few people here speaking about it's downsides.

Only problem I see with this is that iphone 5s support is probably going to be dropped from apple pretty soon. When you can't install the newest software it can't exactly be considered secure.

I would've read the article if there wasn't this garbage blocking popup on site 2 trying to persuade me to register. Crap like this just makes the site look very bad... even when the content might be worth reading (which again is not possible to judge due to this javascript abomination)

I'm in no way an expert so better research your options before doing anything. I don't use windows but I think it should definitely be possible to reinstall it and keep your data (there's probably an option while resetting). However you might also keep infected files. Also I would always do a backup before these things as something may go wrong during the reset. Scan and backup the files you want to keep. You will probably have to reinstall most of your programs as well so maybe keep a note of the most important ones? Also I'd recommend to do regular backups.

Malware disguised as "driver.exe"? It can't start because it's missing a threading library. Reformat your drive or at the very least scan it. I wouldn't run anything critical on a pc that was infected at one point (and not reformated) even if it was "cleaned". That obviously includes typing in passwords.
