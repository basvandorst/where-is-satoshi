Feel free to give it a read and give me a shout if I've made any glaring errors / omissions.

No it's fully automated. It only uses the Blockchains immutability to confirm security of the shipment.

Back services are not free. If they were no one would make money in retail banking. Yes loan payments and mortgages  will make some money but in the UK they have been found out profiting on PPI and overdraft charges costing them billions. These charges were levied against the poorest in society. Yes the UK is a well off country but there is a serious problem with working poverty. 
With batching and soon to be created channel factories this issue can be resolved long term. Soon someone will create a service to open and close lightening channels for the lowest fee via batching. This would possibly be by setting fees for a single block in the day and split the fees between however many people joined the service. You then have a channel open event split between 1000 people once a day and a channel close split between 1000 people a day. This is just as secure as closing yourself but you only pay 1000th of the fees. Think of it like clearing on a stock exchange or a bank. The system then becomes accessable to all and can handle a magnitude of transactions above anything else and is also the most secure. Using the $100 fee in his article this would result in fees of 10¢ for each event. 
The problem then becomes one of protocol and not Moore's law.

Just read the article and have to say he sounds like a used car salesman. He hasn't addressed any of the criticisms in the tweets. I'm all for competition but at some point there will be a single protocol that underpins the financial system, I believe this will be bitcoin due to the catch 22 the network is in. If miners leave the network it becomes more decentralised and the protocol will continue in a healthier state, then the network will grow and miners will jump back in.
Addressing his point about access to the base layer in his article. I will admit L2 solutions will never be as secure as L1 however all users of L2 have access to L1 using the Lightning network as an example channel closures are handled by L1 using the most recent reported channel state. If you make 100000 transactions within the life of that channel once the channel is closed all of those transactions are as secure as if they had been done on L1 individually. The only difference is you payed for 2 onchain transactions instead of 100000.
As a explainer everyone expects access to the justice system in western countries (L1) but you don't expect a police officer to follow you 24 hrs a day. If you ring 999, 911 or whatever number you ring in your country you will have access to the justice system.
Sorry for the format written on my phone.

Sorry just noticed your second point.
I fail to see how the lightening network can be centralised as I am free to open a channel with whomever I see fit (explanation in other comment about how it can be cheap). Yes my salary may come through the same channel but I can use any channel to spend it. At a certain point the lightening network will have a network effect greater than the sum of its main hubs ( these will be present at its inception due to limited adoption). Once this occurs I can receive my salary through 1 channel or 100 simoultaniously (depending on parallel payment development). My employer is no longer required to pay me via the channel with the bank ( whoever their payment processor is with sufficient channel size) and smarter businesses who want to cut costs will go p2p. Think of it when bitcoin was new you had one wallet no exchanges and needed software skills to receive bitcoin. Then the network effect happend, we got more wallets more bitcoin services more exchanges. Everything now is due to the network effect, if people want it it will happen. 
Sorry for rambling

Not looking to use it as a payment method. Im looking to transfer physical actions onto the Blockchain.

Cheers I'll have a look into alternative hardware, just out of curiosity if I was to setup with a pi how easy is it to clone to a new device?
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:18:56
Cheers for the reply, didn't think about the life of the SD card. Might have to look at something a bit more reliable if I'm going to leave it running long term.

Looking for some advice on setting up a full node. I have a spare pi 3 laying around and a 500gb hard drive so was going to setup a full node over Christmas. My questions are;
Once synced and using pruned mode is the pi capable of running solely off the SD card or is the hd required.
Is it possible to mine using a old block erupted or similar or is additional software required?
I understand the chances of mining a block with this setup are miniscule but it's more for educational purposes and fun.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:22:22
Cheers buddy, hope everyone comes out the other side of this.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:41:59
Cheers for the reply but it's for educational purposes.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:29:08
Cheers pal I'll post it up there

Cross post from the daily as I just spotted this was pinned.

Suppose the blockhain is the main part, might have a look at a cheap intel based NUC with a Linux build.

Any one here have a working NodeJS websocket file to handle a level 3 order book from CoinbasePro that they wouldn't mind sharing? 
Thinking of running a real time automated analysis on the various books to see where the current price action is coming from. Would prefer not to have to start from scratch.

Meaning on a personal level not price, what would you need to get from BTC to say that it's mooned?
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:22:03
Yeah I can see some serious disruption happening if we get another full blown hype cycle, when the "late majority" finally decide to get in and realise they are worse off than before relative to the few who invested early and held we could see quite a bit of political unrest.
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:45:14
Fair point, I was thinking of the initial run up, it's use can be priced in years before it is actually used. 
My personal opinion is as there are multiple use cases like SOV, cash, non correlation with existing assets and securing physical assets it could spike pretty quicky.
@_date: 2019-05-05 14:37:10
Yeah I'm not bailing either.
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:51:06
Sounds good. Buy something that makes you money.
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:57:59
He could buy a hard returning asset like property / land or passively own a successful business. Don't think anyone is going to trade hard money for anything other than hard assets to be honest.
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:02:29
Sounds good, 50% is ballsy hope it comes good for both of us.
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:08:20
Fair enough but it sounds like your moon was financial security for life, which I'm pretty sure you'll have with 21 BTC. 
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:52:38
Sounds good, I'm with you on the tropical country.
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:10:16
You'd have to have balls of steel and iron hands to hold through till then without cashing at least some of it out.

Can anyone point me at a FAQ for the ln tip bot? 
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:55:18
Would be great but I can't think of anyone I know who could hold through an initial mega spike to $1m per BTC. If it can't be widely spent at the time a lot of people's strong hands are going to be tested.
