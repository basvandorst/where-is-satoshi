Are you a real person?
Safe deposit box is a great metaphor for why people might desire custodial services for crytpo currencies in the future. 
Storing files is pretty easy too, but people still prefer to pay for google drive and dropbox, etc.

Yeah saying `lightning` to that I think is fair. The CC's are a tiered solution on top of banking that enable high volume transactions. The banks that are doing these transfers aren't executing `1700 tr/sec`. It would only be fair to compare lightning to cc's and btc to banks

He's a "I don't think this is an effective way to predict the future". I think this is universally accepted thought (if it worked everyone would just make free money). 
I think flat Earthers are irrational. I think your comparison to his rational thought to an irrational community is therefore irrational.
I think therefore you are more likely to be a flat earther than he is.

Your viewership algorithm is not sophisticated enough. I've racked up thousands of views in a few seconds. 


Good for you, but this just seems unprofessional. I don't think this is actually a question you are asked frequently, do you want your site to be hostile and combative, or informative and inviting.

How seriously bitcoiners take bitcoin is probably an upper bound for how seriously other people would take it. That's my guiding principle with the products I'm trying to create. So I'd take it seriously.  
You might also benefit from opensourcing your work. The "value" of your creation is probably not your coding, but the user generated content. And that's not something someone can immediately steal by forking your project.

Interesting that you think your experience makes what you say fact. And that picking up a programming book will help people understand the intricacies of how big companies write software.

It's my personal belief as another professional in software that this isn't a valid source and it's crazy that you think it is.
You made a very specific claim, engineers tend to not accept "intuition" as evidence.

So you have to get a sense of what proof of work is trying to accomplish. Proof of work is a solution to the double spending problem, and more generally is trying to help us figure out how to break a tie between two transactions which are both valid on their own, but not together. We want a way to timestamp these transactions, such that we can reject the second transaction as invalid because it came later. 
I look at a hash more as a fixed-size-description of something. You download ubuntu.iso and ubuntu will say it should hash to \`x\`, you run the hash and if it hashes to \`x\` you're set. Another property of a hash is that a slight variation causes you to get a completely different value, so if one bit is off during the download you'll know. I wouldn't say that creating 1 hash is incredibly computationally expensive. However trying to figure out what content hashes to a fixed hash value is very computationally expensive. 
So the proof of work is a game that miner participate in, the game has a few properties that are desirable for the network. What we're trying to achieve across the world is "consensus", once a miner produces a valid block we want to incentive agreement as soon as possible. We want it to be incredibly expensive to do anything other than stay in consensus.
So your \`wallet\` broadcasts \`tx\`s to a \`node\`, \`node\` validates the transaction and asks a miner to include it in a block. The miner will take all the transactions in that block, award itself the mining fee. There's a third value the miner has to place and this is a "guess", what value will make the hash of this entire block start with n 0's. n is the value that gets adjusted based on network difficulty. The only way to get the correct amount of 0's is to put a bunch of guesses in the guess slot. If you get the right answer you broadcast it, it's now the truth. 
Everyone on the network can verify that is the correct hash with 1 operation. It took you many more than 1 operation to figure out what the right value is, but once you have the value, figuring out whether it's the right one is very easy. If multiple miners win at the same time, everyone votes on a winner, whichever chain at that point has more work has a higher probability of becoming the correct chain. Repeat a handful of times and probability of there being more than 1 chain few blocks deep approaches zero pretty rapidly.

I don't think they don't have access to electronics. But the whole concept of "banking for middle America" is a valid point.

If you're on Android you should use Samourai wallet, and if you're on iOS you should use either BRD or Trust Wallet. 
Coinomi is actually not opensource anymore (which is concerning).
