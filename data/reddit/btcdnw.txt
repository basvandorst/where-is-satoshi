If you really want to help, donate to talented people. They will make the best out of it. Donating to dimwits or foundations helping dimwits have more dimwits will only make things worse. Also, there's no point at donating to EFF, the biggest internet companies already lobby for Net Neutrality. The Net Neutrality law was approved in 2015, the internet was already great before it. Its abolition was bad news for companies like Facebook, Google, or Netflix. They don't lobby it because they care about neutrality, since they censor at pleasure. It's about power decentralization, they really hate decentralization.

What's the point of donating to Deep-State sponsored corporations like Wikipedia? LOL, what a waste of money. A fool and his money are soon parted.

Even if they had 100 trillion $ in reserve, they would remain a third world country. It's not money, but people, what shapes a nation. A talentless dimwit wont become suddenly a genius if you give him 1 trillion dollars, talent is not something you can learn, you are born with it. It's not so hard to understand, I don't know why is it even controversial for some people.

Maybe because it's a centralized Shitcoin that will disappear in the long term?

I am a US citizen (never lived in the US though, I was born in Europe, but because of FATCA I have to declare yearly to the IRS) living and working in Switzerland. I have a significal amount of BTC. If I cash out, do I have to pay capital gains to the IRS? I have a bank account with UBS, one of the few accepting US citizens.

Bitcoin did nothing wrong

Coinbase is cancer, it represents everything Bitcoin is fighting against.
