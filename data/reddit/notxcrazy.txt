As long as it is controlled by China (centralization of hashrate), it has 0 value.
You could as well create regular bank account in China.

FUD to manipulate the price, nothing more.
But who could predict Chinese minds...

failed attempt ? different goal ? or just fake news ?

funny how people down voted my comment without giving any response to it.
Truth hurts.
I have lot of money in BTC but if this situation won't change, I'm going out of it.
I wanted to support true decentralization, not Chinese government.

I guess you don't read much technical stuff ? 51% attack says something to you ? or empty blocks ?

no, it's like this for years now, I can't grow big because they limit ahead.
No reseller got quantity I need.
After so many years you would think they manage to produce the required quantity but no, they just produce it for them self and sell a little bit so everyone think it's free market for them.
ASIC production is very simple once you get the design ready.
And no, you won't be able to buy 50 next time, 10 is the constant limit for all current and future releases of *new hardware.

I would have custom clearance problems, and none of the ASIC manufacturers do refunds if the package is sent back.
I am not going with any kind of tricks at this level of investment.

they do not answer for over a month now, if it is so hard to contact them, how could I make business with them ? impossible.
I need new and latest hardware, so I am not contacting other mining operators if they would sell or rent hardware.
Otherwise, ROI is impossible
I need hardware, and there is no source.

if China would really want to ban something, they would have no problem of doing so and it would happen immediately without any warning.
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:48:00
I would need 50 different addresses and 50 different names...
And I'm not investing large amount of money like that.
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:27:16
it's preventing other big investors like me from growing big so only ASIC manufacturers can have big mining operations.
It's getting more centralized because of this. Bitcoin is now mined more than 70% in China alone by ASIC manufacturers.
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:25:09
not true.
the government is even helping mining operations there by providing cheaper electricity sources.
China would not give control of the major cryptocurrency that easily.

@_date: 2019-04-09 22:18:12
I have contacted all ASIC manufacturers and nothing.
This is insane.
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:18:16
good luck with China.
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:40:57
If BTC would change PoW to ASIC-Resistant one, it would be truly decentralized. Now it is fucked up by the selfish manufacturers.

Chinese pools == chinese miners.
Second thing, It's inefficient to use Chinese pools for other parts of the world.
