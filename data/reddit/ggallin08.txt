You are preaching to the choir! Yes, I've heard about these things. But, I'm guessing that you still use fiat once in a while. This makes that easier with aspects that are similar to Bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin is about being open-source, free, and out of the hands of banksters. But, it's also about being a convenient way to buy things. It's not just an idea or a philosophy or a get rich quick scheme. It's a tool that people actually have to use for it to have value.
I'm hoping this helps Bitcoin instead of directly competing with it. When people become comfortable attaching money to an email, they will become more comfortable with an idea like Bitcoin!

Just because it's US only now doesn't mean it will always be that way. I wouldn't use its current limited access as a reason to dismiss it entirely.

I know we are still dealing with a centralized currency and any chance of anonymity is out the window. But, one of the big selling points of Bitcoin is that it's quick, cheap, and easy to send money. Well, this is quicker, cheaper (free!), and easier. I'm sure it won't appeal to the people who are trying to get off the grid or just view Bitcoin as an investment opportunity. But for the vast majority of the people who just want to spend their money, this is Bitcoin that "just works".
Feel free to tell me why I'm wrong! I want to know!
