I am, because of him.

Well good question, as a miner on btcguild myself I know how bad luck sucks. The bigger the pool the less you have to fear bad luck.
What can be done long-term? My best bet is the donation based incentive system for p2pool or some kind of new awesome multipool-proxy-module integrated into mining software like cgminer/bfgminer which has incentive to use and distributes hashrate equally to compatible pools.

Afaik there is no way to be sure, you can only believe them or not. 
25% is CEX.io rest are individuals they say. While CEX uses bitfury ASICs, bitfury also counts as individual miners because they have their own farms pointed there which they reduced by 1.5 PH today according to coindesk.

quoting Vitalik for the easy top answer:
The mechanism relies on a concept known as Schelling points. The way it works is at follows. Suppose you and another prisoner are kept in separate rooms, and the guards give you two identical pieces of paper with a few numbers on them. If both of you choose the same number, then you will be released; otherwise, because human rights are not particularly relevant in the land of game theory, you will be thrown in solitary confinement for the rest of your lives. The numbers are as follows:
14237 59049 76241 81259 90215 100000 132156 157604
Which number do you pick? In theory, these are all arbitrary numbers, and you will pick a random one and have a probability of 1/8 of choosing the same one and getting out of prison. In practice, however, the probability is much higher, because most people choose 100000. Why 100000? Because each prisoner believes that the number 100000 is somehow “special”, and each prisoner believes that the other believes that 100000 is “special”, and so forth infinitely recursively – an instance ofcommon knowledge. Thus each prisoner, believing that the other is more likely to choose 100000, will choose 100000 themselves. Obviously, this is an infinitely recursive chain of logic that’s not ultimately “backed” by anything except itself, but cryptocurrency users reading this article should by now be very comfortable with relying on such concepts.

It is a problem, but the next step is to admit it is a minor and temporary problem. Why?
* they wont risk ruining their entire business and bitcoin by rolling back transactions (double spend attack)
* a possible double spend attack does not mean your coins can be stolen, they are still secured by private keys
* 75% of ghash.io users are private miners which will switch pool as soon as ghash.io would start such an attack
* ASICMiner has 60PH of chips which will be sold and turned into miners this month

I see only 1 valid reason here which is liquidity (reason 1 and 5). I dont see fees and tracking errors as much of a problem.
And I really dont understand Reason 3 "Trading hours": If the ETF just holds bitcoins for their investors how can it matter if the bitcoin price changed overnight while the ETF was not trading?

mostly stupid questions, just ask why some people need to fill out intrusive KYC questions since feb. and some (most?) not. It must have something to do with either personal volume, nationality of the person or their home bank or something even more simple like if sold btc &gt; bought btc
