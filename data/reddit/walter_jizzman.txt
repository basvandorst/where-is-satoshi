Not exactly a brilliant observation there. Obviously you're going to need some kind of intermediary to switch between BTC and fiat or another asset. Holding and transferring bitcoin can absolutely be done without intermediaries. Criticizing Bitcoin for the former is missing the point of Bitcoin. 
Also, Ripple processes transactions in seconds because it isn't decentralized. Bitcoin is the most decentralized cyrptocurrency, and the trade-off for that is 10 minute processing times.
But don't worry, Deutsche Bank researchers, you'll figure it all out in good time after Tim Swanson blows through the R3 money without anything to show for it.

90% of the people invested in bitcoin don't understand the game-theory dynamics at play regarding centralization pressures. At least some of the core developers do, and that's why they're being careful.
Make no mistake - the only thing that makes bitcoin special is decentralization. That's what we must covet over all other considerations.

Relevant section:




whether Bitcoin can be deemed an impermissible pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes are
business models in which the prospective profits of the participants are largely financed by
the deposits of new participants. Without the permanent acquisition of new participants, the
systems collapse, and the investors lose their investments in most cases. Since in the case
of Bitcoin the typical promises of profits are lacking, it cannot be assumed that Bitcoin is a
pyramid scheme. Moreover, the only monetary advantages that can be expected from the
use of Bitcoin are the reduction or elimination of fees.

tl;dr: Bitcoin is actually not anonymous, and it's volatile.
The answer, as always, is that bitcoin is pseudonymous, which is good enough for most purposes. So good, in fact, that I'm pretty sure that most thieves in Bitcoinland have never been caught based on their blockchain history.
The volatility criticism demands that Bitcoin be born fully formed and connected to mature, highly active exchange markets with deep order books. It takes a long time for that to happen, as in many years. It will come in time, but apparently not soon enough for the sneering idiots at publications like The Atlantic. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:34:44

I sold about 15% of my holdings at $320 (on the way up) to cover some expenses. I bought a laptop when the price was in the $900s, but other than that and some minor purchases, I've been holding. 
In retrospect it looks crazy to not have sold at $1000, but at the time it wasn't clear if the price would continue rocketing upward, and as the price started to collapse, it wasn't clear if that was temporary. I'm terrible at identifying peaks/troughs (as are most people), so my only strategy is to sell when I need to buy something.

The great majority of the core devs, the people who ACK/NACK commits to arrive at a developer's consensus, are not Blockstream employees. And it needs to be emphasized that the Blockstream employees were core devs before Blockstream incorporated, and they themselves created Blockstream as a mechanism for funding developers. It should also be pointed out that the Blockstream devs are compensated with time-locked BTC, meaning that they're substantially invested in the long-term success of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-19 02:43:01
That's why the Core team wants fees to rise on the first layer so that  miners can be supported indefinitely. Lightning can then handle the cheap transactions as a second layer..
@_date: 2016-03-02 01:45:31
The constraint isn't with home user's download speeds so much, it's with their upload speeds. And more importantly than that, miner's upload speeds (the speed at which they can propagate a new block to the majority of hashpower).
 I read somewhere that for a miner, every 6s delay in propagating a new block results in a 1% reduction in marginal revenue over the long run. Larger blocks and thus longer delays will cause some miners to lose out disproportionately. This can then be used as an attack vector by other miners (filling up blocks to their max with spam transactions). So the issue is not so easily described as just a bandwidth/storage problem.
@_date: 2016-01-22 22:35:05


That hardly seems fair. What other bad behaviors, for which they aren't responsible, are they supposed to renounce? That seems like an endless list. The onus isn't on Core.

A lot of naive ideas were circulating around back then, but it's become clearer with time that a multilayered approach will be required to support the vision of a decentralized p2p currency that can also handle visa-scale transaction rates.

Nah, there is no hard fork, unless Bitcoin Classic can get approval from 75% of the hash power. It has a big hill to climb to get there, just like XT faced.

The quixotic dream of altcoiners. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 09:16:00
It depends on what you mean by "consensus". If you mean 75% of miners, then that will indeed be a very controversial hard fork, after which there will be two chains, both strongly supported.
For example, were Classic to win 75% miner's consensus and activate its new consensus rules (increasing the blocksize limit to 2MB), there's a significant portion of the community - users, miners, nodes, wallets, and exchanges - that will remain with the Core software. 
I myself will do this. I will also transfer my Classic chain coins to a Classic exchange and sell all of them. Why? Because I don't subscribe to the politics of the Classic team. I, and many others, will consider Classic to be an *altcoin*, while core will remain the real Bitcoin. 
Meanwhile, the Classic chain will also have its staunch defenders. The price of both chains will crash hard, but both coins will sail on. Bitcoin might even hardfork to change its hashing algorithm as a defensive measure.  Maybe one of the chains will get back to the current price in a few years. 
That is what is meant by a controversial hard fork.
