Arbitrarily strong encryption is trivial to implememt using a hash function such as sha256.  Could probably be done in a couple of lines of python or bash scripting, given a hash function.

Practice securing small amounts with cold storage.  Or take a look at coinbase vault with multiparty / multi email permissions or buy into the second market fund...

I am still learning how to trade, and have been left holding the bag on a couple of alts.  But I never sell low.  I am still buying tips for example.  I will buy all of it if needed, same for doge, same for bitcoin.
The only time to sell is when the market is jubilant to take some profit, or at the beginning of a downtrend after some real news.    Never sell when there is blood on the streets.  Buy more !  Which implies you never go all in, and anticipate an unexpected bear and hold enough to buy to the bottom in things that you believe in.

if you had a symmetric rebate towards trading fees on bitcoin sales through coinbase, that would make using coinsetter pretty frictionless.   in the end, its the connection between coinsetter and the end user's bank account.  
Maybe make it a 50BTC limit on buys, and 50BTC limit on sales, or any combination upto some dollar value in fees ?

Maybe teraexchange ?  They are big enough to have more to lose from bad publicity then gaining from stealing.  Even banks have counterparty risk on the OTC derivatives market...  The OTC markets are kind of decentralized.

Bitcoin is better.

What if you only held bitcoin and not currency in mt gox ?

Decentralization isn't going to fix anything.  OTC markets are decentralized, and they can have one side going bankrupt.  Need more centralization.   Risk takers or big movers can stay decentralized on OTC.

I export the private key offline before its address receives any funds.  
When I import the private key, I immediately spend *all* of it, send the *change* back to another address whose private key has never seen the network.  
 "sweeping" references mt. gox practices, more WTF !     Do not "sweep" your private keys to an online service... never give anyone your private keys, unless you are literally using that as a way of spending your funds...

I didn't say it was, just that you could build encryption with it.  See 
For example, you pick a passphrase, encode it as a number.  Say you get 3828293783737764466301 then you take the next n numbers3828293783737764466302, 3828293783737764466303...
You hash each of them, concat the hashes, and xor with your message.  
This is a simple ctr mode stream cipher.
To decipher, you just repeat the process on the encrypted message.  
No need for a 3rd party backdoored encryption algorithm for symmetric encryption.
