I can imagine keeping $500M in a bank because it's inconvenient to store that much cash/gold at home.
But if you've got 500M USD worth of bitcoins, that you can literally store in a thumb drive and just bury it in your backyard, why would you store it in a vault controlled by others?

When did I claim that bitcoin is "the current of the future"? When did I say that I expect regular joe-shmo to do these? Internet was the same way in its early years. It takes time for tech to evolve. Eventually this will be as easy as emails and even then noobs who get their email accounts "hacked" will have their crypto accounts hacked too. But the ease of use will definitely increase over time. But for now, it is complete stupidity to put crypto on 3rd party cloud.
I at least expect regular joe-shmo to research what they are getting into.

Yes bitcoin has no border but if you're a business in the countries where bitcoin is illegal, you publicly cannot accept it. Even if you let your customers know through private channels that you accept bitcoin, the word eventually will come out and government will arrest you. The point is if it's illegal in the country you're living in, the best one can do is work towards changing that law, or leave that country or don't publicize that you use bitcoin.

From OP's perspective: global adoption will lead to that value or smth similar.
My 2 satoshis on the matter: by 2030-2040 we'll stop even comparing it with other currencies. BTC will be the only currency that people will care about and products will directly list their prices in BTC. Of course volatility needs to decrease a lot and that'll hopefully happen in the 2020s.

i am of course advocating DIY. not necessarily engrave it in some metal. There are plenty of ways you can secure your keys. be creative. my point is don't use pre-built hardware from "companies" even if it's open-sourced. I don't want to trust any CEO's in the crypto space who's selling hardware.

I wouldn't recommend anyone buying any hardware to store their bitcoins. Just create paper wallets. Engrave them in titanium or something. Make a few copies. Hide them in your house or different safe locations that you alone can find. Even in a raid these will not be found. That's the strategy people should take IMO

people run nodes just fine by setting up bitcoin core client and lnd. of course that's a bit technical and i hope over time that becomes as simple as installing an exe for most users. The main point I'm trying to make here is that it's a for-profit private company. Better DIY and not trust/depend on 3rd parties.
Now you can make the argument "hey anon, we trust and depend on core devs to build a non-malicious bitcoin codebase" but that's a very large and open community with lots of discourse from both active devs and bitcoin enthusiasts with technical know-how. Bad ideas get weeded out eventually.
You don't need special hardware from a dedicated crypto company. Just buy a rpi and build it yourself. I'd at least wait a year or two and see where casa ends up. Call me a pessimist or a paranoid but those are my thoughts on this.
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:27:35
Yes we can buy stuff on LN. I think OP meant that you can't buy anything with 50sats now which is true because no one's selling anything for 50sats (my assumption, since 50 sats is less than even 1 US cent). But you can of course buy something on LN for 50 sats (if people are willing to sell stuff for 50 sats) because LN allows such low txs.

lightning network is basically how internet works. In internet you have routers and your internet packets get routed in the network. Your router is connected to your ISP and your ISP is connected with some other routers that eventually routes your packet to destination ip address/server be it reddit.com or wikipedia.org.
You don't send your data packets directly to reddit.com. It goes via different routers. You only send it to your ISP and the rest of the routers are not your headache. Similarly, you open a channel with a popular lightning hub. Tons of people create channels with hubs. All nodes are essentially routers. You don't need to create a channel with a specific person because most probably everyone has created channels with popular hubs. So, you sent some transaction to some lightning address. It goes to the lightning node you have opened a channel with. That node finds the shortest route to the recipient like in the internet. It goes over multiple nodes and finally lands into recipient's node.
Look at this graph:  The concentrated nodes are like main routers in the internet and tiny dots are individuals and companies (who accept lightning). Everyone's connected. I hope this makes sense.

not sure what you're asking. bisq is a decentralized p2p exchange. all transactions happen on the base layer meaning the blockchain. i've done some trades on bisq and have some idea of the application. feel free to post more q's here. i'll answer them if i can
@_date: 2019-12-08 00:08:00
maybe. in short, bisq "tokens" are just coloured satoshis. what it means is that it's just regular bitcoin with one extra feature (that only works with the bisq protocol): it lets you vote on important decisions on bisq. that's it. and it lets you do one more thing: pay for fees in bisq and that way you pay a bit less for txs. more info on bisq dao:

@_date: 2019-04-09 11:34:19
I should have been more clearer. If the size had been 300k then we would have 60 GB now instead of what we have currently. I don't claim that reducing size now would reduce the entire blockchain size. That's absurd and impossible. What I was trying to say that if we decrease the block size then the blockchain size would not increase at a rapid rate. That's all.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:30:41
I'm not suggesting that on-chain fees be higher or the txs be in the range of hundreds of thousands as suggested in this thread somewhere.
Let's talk about increasing block size first. Increasing block size increases hardware (ram, storage and cpu) &amp; bandwidth costs by a lot. We don't want that, right? It will reduce the number of full nodes and thus reduce monetary sovereignty and network security.
If we reduce block size, people will be able to afford to run full-nodes. But what consequences does this have on fees? I'm not sure and I'm not technically qualified to make a comment. Let's assume it increases the fees. Why does it increase? Can anyone answer that? What can we do to avoid it and still be able to reduce block size? I'm not suggesting to reduce block size if it increasing tx fees.
The current max size is 4MB and it was increased because it was needed and it was the only option. I'm sure devs would increase it again if that's the only option. But let's work towards other solutions that doesn't involve increasing blocksize, increasing fees and decreasing centralization.

For example, just look at Nick Szabo's twitter account. The guy is so brilliant and yet he likes and retweets pro-trump, borderline white supremacy stuff and other stuff.
As for Assange's rape allegations, hang him if he actually raped someone. But most likely it's a shared smear campaign from the intelligence communities.

 is the only exchange that can be "trusted" because it's decentralized, p2p and open sourced. try it out
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:47:23
300k is 30% of 1M. The current blockchain size is ~ 200 GB. So, 30% of that is 60GB. So, yeah, it's gonna be easier for people from 3rd countries to afford to run full nodes. We need more nodes to keep the bitcoin network secure. All nodes validates the blocks and transactions. If we can reduce block size, then there will be more nodes meaning more secure network.
Also, this will matter more in the future because blockchain size is only gonna increase. Let's say it becomes 500 GB or more. That means an increase in both storage and bandwidth. If we can reduce block size without hurting scalability then what's the problem in that?

There is no 'owner'. Founder is the right word. And you're getting it wrong. He wanted to leave the space and has been saying about it for quite some time. The logic makes sense too. There will always be some issue to fix around the corner and if he keeps it up then he won't get the chance to quit. Satoshi left too and if the community doesn't keep the project alive then 1 guy can't do anything. So, it's best to leave it upon the community.
