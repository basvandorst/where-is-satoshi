I guess you're right, but it seems a 30% bounty is still a little steep.  Perhaps he could have *paid it forward* and the thankful people would likely have showered him with rewards.  That would have made for a **great** news story.  Instead of all the "ponzi scheme", "dark web", and "money laundering" stories the media likes to publish.

I had this happen with a very small amount of BCH.  I did not spend them, however.  Good thing my receiving wallet was at Exodus.io because I successfully used this procedure that allows a user to recover such a transaction:

A "sender" can just create a "receive" address in his wallet.  I think this is what the bchsegwitrecover is suggesting.

I don't believe you need to sign the message at the same place you store the coins, e.g. Coinbase (who used to allow a user to do this but has inexplicably disabled that feature).  Do what I did: Download the Bitcoin Core wallet and sync it to the network.  Then use it to sign the message for the public key that is in question.  The sync will take a few days but it might be worth your trouble.

He didn't just find them laying in the street.  He worked very hard (as he states in his post) to "find" them.  Sort of like someone breaking a window in someone's home, unlocking the file cabinet, and "finding" a bunch of cash there.  It was premeditated, not by chance.

My mistake.  You are right, the BCH I incorrectly sent indeed had an address starting with "1".  I didn't realize the subtleties in the addresses until doing additional investigation today.  Thanks.

Sounds like you've been able to rationalize extortion then.  I would be willing to bet you are Bitcoin Unlimited dev and you knew about this weakness beforehand.

Yep. All FUD.  Dimon can't stand the thought of our cutting in on his business.
