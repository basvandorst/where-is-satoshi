Yea this is not a currency anymore but a game, I bet only a fraction of people are actually using Bitcoin right now as a currency. Hope people will be ready for the crash and not in serious dire straits afterwards.

How do the debit cards work, why would a company exchange bitcoints into dollars, what use would that have for them giving away dollars or euros in exchange for bitcoins?

From UBS.
Of course they do not says it is definitely a bubble, but they say it is very likely a bubble. 
Here is the article:
And even on this Subreddit, even on this specific thread people aren't talking about how convenient Bitcoin is, but how they regret that they didn't get in on the train sooner to make money of it. Like they all talk about it like some investment, and not currency. So IMO it is just waiting to burst.
So even if many people have Bitcoins, they're most likely keeping it instead of using it, and waiting to sell it.
As soon as the value drops again, more people will sell, which leads to even more people to sell, which leads to the bubble bursting.

So it is just a huge bubble. But at least when it crashes it won't have a dominos effect, basically it is all virtual.
Edit: Thanks for the flair, although it is wrong. Reddit account is 3 weeks old, Redditor for far much longer.

Not really answered why these companies do it, or how it works. Why would companies exchange dollars or euros into bitcoin if you can not use bitcoin for anything really?
