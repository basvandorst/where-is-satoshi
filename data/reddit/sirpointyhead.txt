Depends on the individual, obviously. [Several studies]( have shown that learning Esperanto as a precursor to learning a natural language can rapidly speed the learning process compared to students who start on the language from scratch. Based on my own (anecdotal) experience, I got to a level of fluency in Esperanto much faster than in the other languages I've studied. Other Esperanto speakers I know have said similar things.
As for the benefit it provides, people who decide to learn Esperanto tend to have things in common, such as curiosity about foreign cultures and people, idealism, and studiousness. This means that we have a lot of common interests to pursue and topics to discuss -- and that we can do so across language and national barriers. I could go to Iran or Russia or Ghana, find the local Esperanto club, and make friends. That's a very powerful benefit. The Esperanto culture, itself, is one worth participating in, and the language is the medium of that culture. 
Even if you don't want to talk to other people and just learn it on your own, for your own reasons, then obviously it's providing some personal value for you, just like any other hobby, and I won't question that.
None of this, of course, has fuck-all to do with bitcoin, but the idea of a currency that isn't beholden to a national power and can't be controlled by any one entity has obvious parallels with Esperanto's ideals. Even if bitcoin never takes over the world, it doesn't mean that it's "failed", because it, like Esperanto, gets used for its intended purpose by thousands of people.

Neither of those is true.
