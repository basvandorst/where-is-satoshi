I don't know if to like you or be scared of you.. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:10:31
Well damn yeah that makes absolutely no sense. I am not going to buy something that is worth £30 but actually going to pay £42 for it, the logic is not there. Darknet don't accept Litecoin ;&lt;
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:32:01
Yeah I am going to have to rethink something to do because I buy weekly/2weekly online and this is just going to cost way too much for something that is not actually worth those fees. Damn...
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:54:54
Not anymore because of high TX fees ;&gt;
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:45:24
My lots are most prob small to 90% of the people on here hah. It's a lot to me though :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:58:05
Awesome that you tried our ATM and posted it here! Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:58:31
Hope you popped in to use us! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:28:19
Nooo, haha. I have a lot of crypto on there but I wanted to send £30 to buy something, but instead of sending normally like £31-32 incl fees they wanted £43 incl fees for a £30 item... Which I will not do. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:29:10
Yeah I hold a lot of Litecoin anyway, it was more of the fact the website I am buying from only accept Bitcoin or Monero, and regardless of which ever way I do this I am going to be paying some sort of fees..
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:34:15
I tell them the risks, i tell them the amount of reading and research I done before I invested, never helps! They all turn around and say they will read and do research but they only read the 'moon' and the memes that are drawing every sucker in.
@_date: 2018-10-30 10:56:34
I would need for instant exchange in to fiat, simply because all our bills etc have to be paid in fiat. Does this allow that?
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:33:08
This is what I mean, i tell them the risks and everything but they instantly think because of the timescale of bitcoin and what it has achieved it's going to make them millionaires.
@_date: 2018-10-30 10:54:41
Thanks for this.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:47:03
This is why I think I am going to stop even mentioning it, even though for the greater of crypto more people need to invest. Some people just cannot be helped. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:36:15
Just exchange some of your Bitcoin for litecoin and use litecoin for smaller transactions an Bitcoin for larger ones? 
@_date: 2018-10-30 10:55:48
It's where would I find someone like this to help me set this up and understand it. We do multi millions in trade every year and can have no downtime for this and it needs to run perfectly.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:07:23
They say they have had over 100 different companies or people involved in the project from all different fields? Is there any information on these people to come forward with there reputation to acknowledge this is not a scam? I want some!
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:09:30
Yeah I am the same, but even as a HODLer I have that sense of panic, it's a horrible feeling knowing how much money I have invested in it, just that 1 second thought until you realise you went in with what you should be able to afford to loose.
@_date: 2018-11-08 08:57:11
Did you read the article lol? The difference is that it's going to be contactless using NFC. They are different.
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:11:50
Ashford, New Romney, Folkestone, Dover ��
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:17:01
We have them in quite a few places, but we are based in the South East &amp; Kent, pretty much most towns.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:45:21
Thank you! If and when I get them installed I will make a new topic with information for people :)
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:41:22
Thanks for this. Good information. I will actually contact a few around London, i know a lot of the owners there anyway so good idea on that one, thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:01:45
Yeah I mean that's what I do generally anyway, but say I have 300 litecoin and it went and jumped to 10k a coin tonight, I'd most deffo want to cash out some of that for a nice house and car? I know I am going off a bit but some people did make millions from this and I just wanted to know if there was a safe and easy process. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:16:12
Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:43:31
Not at the moment, it's on my 3rd next store, going to Redhill on Wednesday to checkout the belfry shopping Centre. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:06:49
This I guess is why regulation in some ways would be good? Or is it a case of having to pay the right taxes for the income made? I actually spoke to my accountant a out this in the UK the other day, for I'd one day my dew hundred litecoins make it to the millions... 
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:07:01
Hey. Thanks for the reply, and this is just a personal opinion, but I think having an ATM gives a better look over the whole idea of Bitcoin, just my opinion though, and that's what I want, a good look that customers can then ask 'wow what's this'. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:23:19
Afraid not at the moment, Reading is 5th on my list of stores to do (we avarage 3 a year at the moment), so keep an eye out for next year! 
@_date: 2017-09-04 07:09:25
Well to out things in a little perspective, I saw an ATM and when Bitcoin was 3200, they was charging 3400, so you can actually put your fee up to however much you want, to me this is completely stupid and robbing and it's not how I want to run mine, but you are completely flexible to make as much as you want. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:40:58
Thank you very much. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:05:18
How small would you do? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:46:24
PM me link. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:46:24
PM me link. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:29:00
I think the closest would be our Hove store.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:28:00
Corrected. Thanks for noticing that, i was copy and pasting parts of the addresses lol.
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:21:25
I am not Prohibition, we are Totally Wicked.
Thanks for this, the only thing with doing this is I find asking people to come in and do this whilst I am doing it on a laptop or computer does not seem anywhere near as appealing or 'legit' as using an ATM machine that looks completely legit, the problem which I still find with Bitcoin and when I talk to people about Bitcoin is that it still has a stigma with 'darkweb' and 'gangs' and 'guns'. 
I want to eliminate that mind thought of people so when they come in to one of my stores, they see the ATM machine and then ask questions, i understand the people that are already invested in crypto and have done there research might be very happy to do it the other way but I want to capture a new audience that have no idea what crypto even is.
I am going to have a TV above each one with tutorial or a guide or something too, we have a lot of customers through our doors daily.
Thanks for the information :)
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:56:43
Pretty nuts though, I just don't know how I would do it? In the 10s of thousands or 100s or what, even then do you cash out loads at a time or 1 by 1, pretty scary if you do have all that money and you want to cash it. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:17:50
I think I would like to operate our own ones. I believe in the future of this &amp; I will be damned if someone is going to make profit from my customers &amp; hard advertising lol
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:28:44
Will do! :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:41:57
Hah, yeah I did indeed and finally found a company that is willing to help us out in quick time. 
I will do bud thank you.
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:15:59
I mentioned in another post here that my intentions are not to really make money from this, it's more awareness to get more people involved because to me, the more people that do invest the more my money goes up anyway from my portfolio.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:59:11
Now you messed with my mind a little bit more, I mean I trust it on a hardware wallet sure but say i wanted to spend a mil which only accepted fiat. Just the process seems so risky and scary. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:08:02
I mean say you wanted to buy a 800k house and a nice 100k car. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:27:30
Thanks for pointing that out, i copied and pasted parts and that was an error! :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:41:28
Yeah so check this link 
Check one of the guys there, at the moment in the UK the Bitcoin price is £4025 but on there website in store they are selling for £4374 a coin, which I think is offputting and daylight robbery and honestly a complete farse to this community. I want to eliminate these people for the robbers they are, i know we are about 20+ miles away from them but I hope for the sake of £300 people will make the journey!!
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:02:41
That too I guess. Do they have to inform authorities for that? Or put a ban on it or something? To think this could all happen in the future for some of us. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:45:12
Good advice, thanks a lot. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:18:44
Honestly, to begin with it's not so much about me making money, so I am going to keep my fees as low as possible, this is more of an awareness thing to hopefully intergrate payment in to my store from crypto, this is going to help me understand any customers that are or might be interested in crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:45:41
Hi. We now have them in the Tunbridge Wells store and Hastings Town, we are called totally Wicked. You can Google those locations and we will pop straight up! They are I'm store now. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:20:35
Hey! Honestly I am not 100% sure either but from what I understand it does have a QR reader and also a UI that you can manually input the address on. We have a backend system that we can actually make our own fees, as in some other towns quite far away I have seen them charge around £200-300 EXTRA per coin (Which I think is daylight robbery!)
My aim is to take the smallest fee possible and to educate people about the technology and if they feel they want to invest then so be it without robbing them. I will have a lot more information tomorrow :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:55:18
A very do approached me after I made another post a month or so ago pleaing for someone to get in touch to get these in to my stores! Once I have trialed them I will update another post with either a recommendation or not. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:14:03
That is disgusting... Not only do you have to think about the security of your coins on the ledger you now have to think about the amount of money the ledger costs itself, hah.
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:43:06
Is keeping my coins on exodus more safe than a mobile wallet like Coinomi? Are hackers more likely to access your PC rather than your phone? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:33:13
I would rather the $10k BTC also lol I guess, but damn $10k...
