It’s a 991 generation it’s at most a few years old. It’s new.

It’s worth about 1/3 of the lowest Lamborghini so that’d be pretty dumb. Not even close to the same class of car.
If it was a GT2RS or even a Turbo S then you have an argument.

A 911 is just as impractical as a huracan. If anything less so because most of them are rwd.

Lol you have no idea what you’re talking about. This is 3 paragraphs of bullshit. 
First of all, that isn’t a 911 Turbo. All of the base models of the 911 are RWD. This one happens to be a 4s so it’s AWD. 
The engine being mounted in the rear, is much further back than any other supercar. Other supercars are mid engined. But nevertheless it’s not for weight distribution, that’s just how they are.
The 911 RSR has actually moved to a mid engined layout because it’s much better for weight distribution.
The next paragraph you wrote just really weird, and reads like a 14 year old on cocaine wrote it. The Ferrari F8 doesn’t even exist yet, and I seriously doubt you’ve driven a P1. 
Finally, no 911 besides the Turbo S or the GT2 is going to touch a modern supercar on the track. Not even close. The base models don’t even have 400hp.

Yes. 
And the 911 carrera isn't a supercar.

Everyone still thinks in dollar.
Regardless of your beliefs in the potential of crypto to replace the USD as the reserve currency of the world, it won’t happen anytime soon. Anyone who doesn’t “think in dollar” isn’t a participant in what is still 99% of the economy and global financial system.

That article you linked has absolutely nothing to do with anything you just said haha, what is your deal? This is like arguing with an autistic wall.
I literally just said that no 911, BESIDES A GT2, has a chance of catching a modern supercar. What do you do, but proceed to link a GT2 beating a modern supercar. The GT2 is literally 7x more expensive than a base model 911.
The F8 has not been released to the public yet. The P1 is is 4 years old, and they're over 1.5 million now, so no, you didn't drive one. I don't need to do research, I know what I'm talking about. Interestingly enough I've been given a ride in a P1 by a friend of a friend.

A Huracan is hardly a racecar for the street. It's an audi.
