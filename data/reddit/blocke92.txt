In this local only government then, how could we deal with the homeless problem that I described above?

This...is actually a REALLY neat idea. Make most government actions local, but maintain a small federal tax. People can go to locale's that they believe would best support themselves.
One negative thing that might occur, is suppose there are only 2 towns. One has high support for the homeless, one has low support for the homeless. Anyone with income would more likely move to the town with low homeless support. Leaving the high support town with no income to tax, and therefore it collapses.
That is one problem that I notice with that idea, but some modification (make homeless support a federal responsibility) could really make that idea a great research topic.

You receive services from taxation. You are exchanging your money for a service. How is this theft?

I assume, that in addition to your hate of taxes, you hate big corporation. Well, your taxes help fight "big corporation", that is, monopoly exercising market power. This is done through regulation. Who regulates? The government. Who pays the government? You do, through taxes.
Who ensures that your water isn't contaminated? The government. Who pays the government? You do, through taxes.
Who limits crime? The government. Without government, and your support of it, then anyone can enter your domicile and steal all of your belongings. Who pays the government? You do, through taxes.
If you want to continue to enjoy your current safe and comfortable lifestyle, then please children, pay your taxes.
