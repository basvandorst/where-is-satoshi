I don't know why they didn't correct you.  Just today I remembered that I had a few BTC in a Bitcoin Qt wallet that I hadn't touched in ages.  Opened it, it was 32 weeks behind.  I sent the BTC to another wallet and it went instantly. So in my experience, this isn't an issue.

Why do you think it doesn't come from you? Even if you don't pay any fees or interest to a bank, so long as you have money deposited in the bank, you are still funding it. The bank will loan out your money to other customers at a higher rate of interest than they pay you. The gap between the two contributes to schemes like insurance as well as the profitability of the bank.

I'm so conflicted. I want to support bit coin but don't want to support Zynga. Argh. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 00:17:58
My complaint? I don't recall complaining about anything. I was simply pointing out that your claim that you aren't funding insurance against individual account losses was incorrect. If you have deposited funds in a bank, you are funding said insurance, even if it's indirect. 
I happen to think it's a decent model. Very different to BitCoin, obviously, but attractive to those who are unable or unwilling to protect their finances.

I think it’s important to understand the motives of people who may be pumping the price. They don’t necessarily care about bitcoin, they want wealth and will take whatever actions they think are necessary to accumulate more of it. 
In years gone by, that’s been pumping the price. In the future, it may be tanking the price because they’re holding short positions (although I think we’ve seen both in the past). They’re not pumpers, they’re manipulators and they manipulate in their favour with no thought or consideration given to others in the market. These people are not like you or I who believe in the technology, they simply see it as another asset to be traded to maximum profit potential. They would happily destroy the entire bitcoin and wider crypto currency ecosystem and market if they thought it would benefit them. That’s the game we’re in. It never used to be that, and I long for the idealism of the early days, when things were much more innocent. 
As always, unless you’re using bitcoin as a day to day currency, only purchase what you can afford to lose.

Something similar happened to me yesterday. I realised that on one of the websites I run I implemented a tip jar using bitcoin a few years ago (probably four or five, I don't really remember). The site is basically dead and has been for some time. Went there yesterday and realised someone had tipped me 0.1btc at some point! It would have been worth next to nothing at the time, but now it's worth a bit.
Thing is, the wallet is on my old laptop in a draw somewhere and may or may not work any more.

On BA? Not much, they’re both terrible. 1st is typically in a 1-2-1 layout with business in a 2-4-2 layout. You get a lie-flat six foot six seat in first but only a six foot seat in business. Food and drink is better, but still not great. You can use better lounges, like The Concorde Room in Heathrow, but even the first class lounges aren’t great compared to other airlines. 
It’s not worth the extra in my opinion but I wouldn’t recommend BA in business class to anyone.

Club Europe is 29 inches. Ryan Air is 30. It’s not unusual for a Club Europe flight to be ten times the cost of a Ryan Air flight on the same route. 
Unfortunately most European airlines have similarly terrible short haul business class products. And as someone who only travels in better classes for the leg room, I’d rather pay the extra £15 on Ryan Air for an exit row. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:40:28
I did the same. Flew in first and decided it wasn’t worth the extra over business. I’ve been trying other airlines in the last few years and they’re all better than BA in business (all being well I’m flying the new Q Suites with Qatar in a few weeks, which I’m *super* excited for). I’ve not had service issues with BA but I have had issues with maintenance and cleanliness etc. Even their newer planes somehow feel old, but that might be the dated seat design. 
And don’t get me started on short haul in Club Europe. It’s an absolute joke. Less leg room than on. Ryan Air flight is really taking the piss in so-called business class. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:54:06
I’ve no idea. I think I’ve only flown them once. People applauded when the plane landed, like it was something to be celebrated. That concerned me. 
Fortunately I don’t fly short haul often.

Coinbase rather famously doesn’t give you access to your private keys. If you’re storing coins there, they’re not really yours. I believe you can get your private keys from a Copay wallet but it looks quite involved and I’ve never used it. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:49:11
So long as you control your private keys, you’re ok. So not on an exchange or certain online wallets, basically, not that you should be storing your coins there anyway. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:53:37
No. You need one wallet, that holds your current Bitcoins, that allows you to export your private keys. Then, at some point **after the fork** you need to find a wallet that supports the forked coins that also allows you to import private keys (I can't imagine any that wouldn't allow you to do this). This *might* be the same wallet but is more likely to be a different one.
A good example that you can work through is for Bitcoin Cash. [This annoyingly formatted article]( explains the process to claim Bitcoin Cash using Electrum and Electron Cash (which is a fork of the Electrum Wallet). Note that the first few steps of downloading Electrum isn't necessary - the point they're trying to make is that you should empty the wallet of bitcoin before exporting the private keys because if someone gets hold of these keys, they have all your bitcoin. There will no doubt be wallets created for these forked coins with the intention of stealing private keys and claiming bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:57:26
Yes, that's correct. Just be aware that all of that should be done **after the fork**. The only thing you need to do pre-fork is make sure you're holding your Bitcoin in a wallet that allows you to export your private keys (or, if you're feeling brave, trust someone like Coinbase to manage it all for you - pro tip: don't do this).
And for the avoidance of doubt, in order to claim whatever the forked coin is you will need the private keys for the bitcoin wallet that held your Bitcoin *at the time of the fork*. You can do whatever you want before and after the fork, but the fork effectively freezes the other bitcoin version of that wallet until you act on it.
Think of it like copying a password protected file on your computer. Once you've copied it you can change either copy completely independently of the other yet they both use the same password (your private key). You can also make further copies of either file after making changes (I'm eagerly awaiting the first popular fork of a fork!).
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:32:48
Essentially you need to find a wallet that supports whatever coin it is you’re trying to claim. Then you import your private keys (relating to your normal, standard, bitcoin holdings in to that wallet. The process will vary depending on wallet. As Coinbase don’t give you access to your private keys, they’re basically doing this for you. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:01:46
Wow. Really interesting. I thought I'd heard people saying it may have been on some sort of time delay, so a bunch of infections triggered at the same time. I've not seen any evidence to support this though.
Given the profile of this attack and the agencies involved (NCSC is an offshoot of GCHQ) I'm certain they'll find the attack vector. The question is whether they publish it or not. 
I hope you've got a back up and you're not too inconvenienced.

How did you get infected? What OS are you running and are you running any anti-virus?
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:45:52
Was this a targeted attack? It seems like you'd have to be incredibly unfortunate for this to be coincidence. Any suspicions of an inside job? Did you publish you had holdings of that size anywhere? You mention they securely wiped the machine that was connected to, did you have it professionally, forensically, analysed at the time? 
Have you contacted your local tech crime unit? Some are now claiming to be able to track even mixed coins and given the gap in time it would seem your best bet of catching them will be when they try and spend them (I would imagine the temptation is too great at the moment given the price increase). I suspect it's too far gone for proper analysis of what happened at the time. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:51:07
The rumours I'm hearing is that it's propagating through one of the exploits in the recent NSA leak which MS patched a few weeks ago. So that couple of months lag on updates may have cost you. Sorry man.

I'd definitely advise looking in to an offline solution too. Especially one that keeps a version history of your files. If your backup medium is mounted when the ransomware hits, the bastard thing will encrypt that too! At least if you've got versions, you can step back to before the encryption. I'd definitely say that should be in addition to a local backup solution though, not instead of one, just for speed (most recoveries I do are individual files, not the whole file system). I use BackBlaze because they have native clients (a lot of the other providers just use Java clients, which are resource hogs). Can't go wrong for a fiver a month. 
Also best to keep an eye on bleeping computer (which tends to be the go to place for ransomware). 
If a decryption took becomes available, it will be posted there (they've posted decryption tools for previous ransomware variants in the past).

@_date: 2017-05-12 21:28:05
Shit. Sorry to hear that. If it's any consolation some of these ransomsware attacks get decrypted with the instructions published on line. Hopefully this is one of them. And as I said, there are some pretty well resourced organisations looking at it not just in the UK but across the globe (seems like 20+ countries have been hit). 
The one thing I would say is that based on the implementation, I can't see how they could know you've paid, so it's probably a scam. It seems like a load of the infections are using the same address, so they can't tie it back to a single instance. So I wouldn't waste my money paying them unless you see widespread reports of it working reliably.

This is the truest comment. I'm a long term hodler (since $40) but I've used bitcoin numerous times to buy things, I just replace the amount I've spent immediately afterwards. That way I'm adding to its legitimacy whilst not losing out on an investment (other than fees, which I'm more than happy to eat). 
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:55:48
I'm in a relatively similar situation.  I'd been using blockchain to buy BTC for the past few weeks and am now a bit stuck.
I'm currently in the mt.gox queue but getting credit in to mt.gox looks like a huge hassle compared to the convenience of blockchain and pingit, and fraught with risks.

It's a self-hosted Wordpress site and it might be worthwhile considering turning it in to a Wordpress plug-in (it wouldn't be difficult).

Thanks for the thorough response.  I guess for it to become viable one of two things will have to happen.  Either the cost of spinning up an EC2 instance reduces dramatically or the price of BTC increases dramatically.  And even then, the onset of ASICs and the inevitable increase in difficulty that will represent will nullify any small advantage.
@_date: 2013-04-07 00:24:42
As someone who's never done any mining, I'd appreciate it if you could answer a question for me.
You say it loses $5/day which confuses me.  Presumably (again, showing my lack of mining knowledge here) when you mine you get a coin, or portion of a coin, in return.  Now given the BTC -&gt; USD price of coins in on the rise, won't that $5/day loss turn in to a profit once the price of BTC goes up?  And if so, how far will it have to go up before it becomes profitable (ignoring, for the time being, the increasing difficulty - although I think that's a relatively moot point given that the value of BTC is increasing more quickly than the difficulty of mining)?
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:33:36
I think it shook out a lot of the speculators and left people who have an interest in Bitcoin itself, as a platform, not as an investment vehicle.
I *really* don't want the price to start skyrocketing again as it makes it incredibly difficult to actually use Bitcoin to buy things.  Yes you need a certain aspect of speculation to keep volume up but not to the extent where it's *the main thing* the currency is used for because at that point, it's no longer a currency.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:48:35


I really doubt that.  I'm in a position where I could be buying if I want to but I'm staying well away from things until they calm down.  I can't imagine many people thinking this particular slump has bottomed out, especially since we *know* mtgox will be lagging hard when it reopens dealing with the backlog of orders, which will cause the price to drop even further, which will cause more people to cash out, which will cause the lag to increase, wash, rinse, repeat.
I think it's going to be *at least* a week before we see any form of stability in the market, and where it stabilises, who knows?
@_date: 2013-03-30 00:46:16
I don't think it's familiarity but rather the fact that they are ubiquitous.  I can use my debit card to pay for almost anything, with no fees attached.  i walk in to a shop, put my card in to a little machine, type my pin (chip &amp; pin in the UK) and within a second or so I've paid for whatever it is I'm buying and am walking out of the shop.  My salary gets paid in to the account directly.  I can go to any atm, and there are 100s within a few miles of almost any location, and get cash out immediately, without a fee (for the most part).  If I want to transfer money to another person I can do it via bank transfer, cash or cheque.  I know that they can accept at least one of these methods.
I'm not saying that bitcoin doesn't support similar mechanisms, but they're not ubiquitous yet.  I could be very familiar with bitcoin, but that doesn't make it any easier to buy a bottle of vodka from my local supermarket with bitcoin because *they're* not familiar with it.

I think it would be nice to have a version that's completely stripped of all styling, that's what I would do if I were going to use it (and I'm considering it).  That way I can just apply the styles from my site to the tips jar which would guarantee it would fit aesthetically.

If you have the ability to push significant volume through you can control the point at which the fall stops to a certain extent.
