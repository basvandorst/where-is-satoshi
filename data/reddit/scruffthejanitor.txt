Do it then
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:05:05
But is this based on never spending any of that money?  
That doesn't really equal a job then.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:18:57
I know, thats why I set 371 when I sent it but for some reason got sent at 221. 
Thanks ledger.

Of course its never broken $1000 walls so fast. 
Look at % increase, not $ increase.  
Going from $1000 to $2000 is not the same as $13000 to $14000.

Wrong sub
@_date: 2018-09-12 10:42:54
Probably because during the last bull run this sub was full of new crypto kids saying how Bitcoin and is dead and then buying a whole bunch of trash and saying how it will overtake Bitcoin.  
The amount of portfolios posted with 0% Bitcoin was insane. It was actually more likely to see someone without it, than with it.

They're fantastic. Easy to use, nice interface, nice to know a hack can't lose all your money.  
Even if you have $1k you should probably invest in one at the price they are.

Paid $20 transaction fee, 70 mins later and not even 1 confirmation. Wtf
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:08:09
211 sat fee. 6.5 hours. 0 confirmations.

You're not any different.

A 10x jump. Bitcoins a fair way off $18000 atm.

Yet they leave us decades behind with their shitty new internet infrastructure
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:12:54
Huh? In a private wallet you would have got 1 BCC for each 1 BTC you held. Currently worth over $400usd
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:39:18
"I didnt make $400 because I'm too lazy/dumb to do a simple task"
Even funnier is you have made no profit, you hold a bitcoin, not cash. You have a coin on an exchange that could bail at anytime and leave you with a loss.  
So lets see keeping in on the exchange saves little time, costs profit and has the potential to leave you with a loss.  
Whats the advantages there, mate?  Grow up.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:11:10
Nope. 
If he wanted to invest in Bitcoins then he would have used cash to buy them, even if he had spent previous owned bitcoins on the silk road.
If he bought bitcoins just to spend on the silk road and had 0 intentions in investing, then either way hes not keeping the bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:41:41
Dollars that he would have used to but Bitcoin.   
You realise you can use money to but Bitcoin, right? With less money you can buy less Bitcoin. 
So he doesn't buy $100 with of money with the Bitcoin he has, so he has $100 of Bitcoin. 
Instead he spends $200 cash ofd the street that he could've bought Bitcoin with giving him $200 of Bitcoin.

Now trading at $1100 on Bittrex. Man this just keeps getting more and more of a dumb mistake LMAO.  
But I'm sure theres going to be a time when you urgently need Bitcoin and can't wait the few minutes it would take to transfer to Coinbase. Hahahahahaaha
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:36:30
Man you are getting salty hahaahha
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:58:36
Says you.
Now he buys molly from the guy down the road for double the price of what it would be on silk road. If he didn't he would have put that money into Bitcoin.      
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:27:07
I mean there is. You could've sold the BCC for more Bitcoin.  
Also there is no advantage to keep it in Coinbase except laziness.  
It's easy to move to a private wallet where it's safe and won't be lost if Coinbase suddenly goes away.  
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:16:15
God this sub is fucking shit
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:54:42
And then you regret not buying at $500 when it bounces back to $1000.  
Always regret.

Yeh I don't think 6 year olds grasp the concept of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:51:06
A physical thing, sure, But a digital concept they they cant see or grasp the concept of. No fucking way.  
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:17:56
I don't. But I do believe there are actual people in there that believe them and will buy BCC. Just won't be many, but they will exist.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:51:08
r/btc have people saying they will sell of their Bitcoin for more BCC.    
So there will be people.
@_date: 2017-07-18 09:10:04
But they are actually young enough to care about the future and also actually understand technology and the world we live in.    
The current fucks done give a shit because they'll be dead soon and are clueless about half the shit that has come about in the last couple of decades.
