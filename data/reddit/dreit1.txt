Kudos to you, but you are in the minority. The sad truth is that people won't learn about it, won't learn how to safely store and mess up. There are numerous attack vectors on bitcoin on both exchange, and on local storage(varies of course depending on what kind of local storage you have)
However, keeping it on exchange mitigates one important source of error. Pure technical incompetence. If you are technically competent than you should have no problem securing bitcoins locally.
However, people HAVE to realize that a large proportion of people getting into bitcoin nowadays are exactly that, technically incompetent. 
So the first set of advice should not be to get your coins off of exchange. It should be leave it there, spend a week of your time researching what's going, watching videos, etc...exactly like you have done and THEN moving it off of exchange

Agree small amounts good, you're entire stack right away bad. I'm just advocating more people putting these kind of disclaimers when they say "move off exchange ASAP"

I'm not advocating leaving them on their permanently, but the first advice people hear when people buy bitcoin is get your coins off of exchange. Before they even understand what something like a private key is. Which leads them to lose their money.
Leave them on there until you know what the fuck you're doing...is the advice that should be given.

What's more likely? Coinbase shuts down? Or a noob loses his private key? This isn't the Mt.Gox days anymore, this is bad advice to a noob, and I've seen hundreds of people of lost money because of this

You underestimate how "easy" it is for a nontechnical user, who doesn't know what a private key is

You can run something like dBFT where each institution is a validator node. That way all banks do not have to trust each other, because they all have a stake in the pie. This is a massive infrastructure improvement. Right now moving large sums of money between institutions requires some sort of clearinghouse, which is costly and inefficient.
Private inter bank chains are very much a disruption.
