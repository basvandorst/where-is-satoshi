Thats exactly what it is. There are no recovery options here.
apart from phishing, this is one big disadvantage of bitcoin over normal banking.
And these two are the only two disadvantages, acc to me.

If you read the report, what they want to express is that 4 mil bitcoins haven't been moved in five years.   
That's it. Before five years, they all may have been moved, or not moved, that does not matter for this stat.
@_date: 2019-07-25 11:53:02
they weren't mined into those addresses. Some maybe, but not all.
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:22:50
Thats a misleading sentence. What they wanted to write was that 4 million coins have only ever been in just one address....
Damn, its hard to create a valid sentence expressing this relation in one go.
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:20:20
yes, you're right. 
To expand a bit: All the btc in existence, are in the "blockchain" in the form of UTXO's (unspent coins/transactions).
what a person has is the private keys to access those coins. That private key can be in the form of a 12/24 word seed too.
If we lose the keys, we cannnot* move the coins (so we can't sell them, for example).
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:36:21
I edited a mistype. I meant if we forget/lose the private keys, then the coins/utxo corresponding to those keys cannot be moved at all. Then they can be said to be lost (but technically they're still there, but cannot be accessed).
No seed means no other way to access them.

I am a programmer, and I want to look at the code that actually does the ... stuff. 
Where do I start? 
Specifically, lets say I want to know which file or function is invoked when I send $1 to someone, what is the open source code you'd ask me to look into?  ( assuming there is a standard code somewhere, and not just code of electrum or some other wallet application).

For me, 40k per btc is moon. Its an arbitrary number. 100k is pretty much impossible imo. Because, before bitcoin capitalization hits a trillion, governments would step in and suppress it.

If your time frame is just 5 months, then you could end up with less money than you started with if you invest in bitcoin. 
Cause bitcoin is touching all time highs. If it can fall, it can fall now.
Bitcoin is for long term holding, for years.

Philippines has a lot of people who get money from abroad, whether from relatives/family working in mid-east, or ones who have settled abroad, or people who work online etc. The last type is the target market I think here.

A better currency could come along, and **slowly** gain traction. That could actually destroy bitcoin, as in people would just move to that currency, leaving bitcoin with low volume and price.

A unique private key is associated with each public address. You can share your (public) address, but never share your private key. Private key is only known to you, or your wallet.
A wallet is a software or hardware that stores your addresses and keys. Electrum is a good option for you if you have a desktop. Electrum works by using something called a seed, which are 13 words. These words can be used to regenerate your address and private keys, so you need to keep the seed as private.

It takes time for people to understand true genius. It took decades for people to acknowledge Darwin's theory of evolution. Even today you can find creationists who don't believe it. Thats why bitcoin is taking time to spread!

You joke, but just as there was "the social network" for facebook, where winklewii had a small role, there will be a movie about bitcoin which will star these brothers. One day it will happen once they've made billions and facebook is forgotten.

I won't even blink if it goes to 3000. If it drops to 2000, I may think that "these sellers are stupid". If it goes to 1000, I may think of buying more. If it goes to 500, I will start buying.
