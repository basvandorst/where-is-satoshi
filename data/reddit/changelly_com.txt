Simplex should send you bitcoins after the payment processing. Unfortunately we are not responsible for that process after the redirection you to their payment form.
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:21:39
Hey! our apologies for the delayed answer. We were overwhelmed in support after the crypto flash in December. How we can help? What's your TX id?
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:13:56
Hello! The truth is that we have a partner that provides bankcard support. Sometimes it lacks liquidity and unilaterally sets higher rates. 
We have quite fair rates for crypto-to-crypto pairs. But when it comes to fiat payments, things get complicated, since our partner has to cover risks of chargebacks. 
Despite higher fiat rates, we provide instant exchange without revealing identities and other know-your-customer procedures. We do admit that our fiat rates are higher than on the market. However, they are beyond our control and set by our bank card payments provider. For this reason, we do suggest you check all details attentively before sending money.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:01:00
Hello! We're sorry you had this bad experience. As far as we're aware, this problem appeared because you sent your money to a wrong address so we couldn't make an exchange in minutes. Yesterday our support resolved your issue by using the right wallet. You should have received your XRP already. Please be careful in the addresses next time you send money.
Recently we were clogged with the tickets and it's our goal for 2018 to decrease such awful delays in answers. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:24:56
Hi there! Your transaction is finished. Please check your wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:30:50
Dear customer, Simplex is our bank cards processing partner. For the issues please, contact their support team.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:32:18
When redirected to Simplex, Changelly doesn't display a transaction made. There is a technical reason behind each issue happening this way. If you contact them, they will help you out. You could also put support as CC so that we will take measures if needed.
Hope for your understanding
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:40:52
Hello! Please note that the burning process is not the same as exchanging. Burning QTUM may take from several hours up to several days.
Hope for your understanding
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:29:15
Dear customer, what's your changelly TX id? We will check! in December was extremely high demand, exchange volume has grown 5 times, we were overwhelmed in support, sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:09:29
Hello! In a range of cases, this happens since a transaction gets into a mempool before mining. Once it gets into a block and gains confirmations, you see your coins in your wallet. For Bitcoin, it can take a couple of days. In other cases, if a transaction is not found, we repeat the payouts, without any exceptions. Currently, our technical and support teams are working 24/7 to fix all bugs that may occur during the transaction process and provide all assistance needed.
We sincerely apologize for making you wait. Hope for your understanding
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:35:10
Hey! If your transaction is still have not finished, please provide its ID and a hash from in the blockchain, so we could assist you. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:22:46
Oh, we're so sorry for making you wait such a long time. Salt is under maintenance, unfortunately. We've temporarily delisted it in order to prevent further transaction failures and provide the stable support of the coin. Your transaction will be finished, once Salt comes back. ETA is around one week. Our apologies for the inconvenience. Hope for your understanding.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:43:52
Dear Ryan, we are sorry for making you wait. Our support center is heavily overloaded due to the high demand. Actually, for the same reason, blockchain clogging, the transaction was delayed. However, it has been finished since Dec 18. Kindly check your history on TX 04acb8887c4a and wallet for the funds. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:11:17
Hey! We are actively working on this matter. As you could notice, Changelly started supporting SegWit addresses for Digibyte recently. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:17:17
Hello! 
Thank you for the information provided. We apologize for the issue and making your wait. The delay happened due to technical reasons with QTUM that made us to temporarily delist it. Currently, QTUM is turned off in order to prevent issues like this. Once we fix processes related to QTUM, we will refund your coins. Please don't worry.
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:03:41
Hi! Could you please specify your transaction ID so we could look into the matter? Most probably, your transaction hasn't been included in the blockchain yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:12:39
We've checked again exchange, related to the EOS hash, was completed at 2017.12.18 14:03 UTC. sorry for the mistake with the date, comment fixed. We can attach 4.5 BTC hash, but never disclose private data without customers approve. Let the owner check exchanges history and his wallet and update the topic @_date: 2018-09-12 10:38:45
Do you have its number? It is quite difficult to understand what really happened without this data:( Please feel free to contact us in DM as well.
@_date: 2018-09-26 12:58:08
Thanks! Fixed.
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:24:15
We'd like to help you out with the matter, but, unfortunately, the comment seems to be deleted like the account as well.
@_date: 2018-08-13 10:46:43
Hello! 
We have already replied you in different threads and our security team is still waiting for the required data for KYC check. Unfortunately, you haven't send it to us for several weeks. Please provide us with your docs shortly so we could check them and verify your account. We have no intention to withhold your coins but until you keep refusing to send the origin of your funds, we won't be able to release them.
@_date: 2017-03-05 10:27:59
Hey! Much thanks for your positive feedback. Happy to serve you!
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:54:53
Hey! Changelly official is here. Unfortunatly missed your question.   
Feel free to check our customers feedback on bitcointalk or twitter:  
  
  
And you are welcome to Changelly instant exchange!  
Hope you will give us a try 
@_date: 2019-03-25 16:36:23
Hey! We do understand your resentment but please let us clarify the situation. We have reasonable exchange rates for crypto-to-crypto transactions. Fiat-to-crypto transactions are processed alongside our card payments providers as we deal with crypto only, hence the rates can be higher than market ones in these cases since our partners have to cover their own financial risks.   
It won't hurt to mention that all customers may evaluate the rate provided and get a clear picture beforehand and take a decision.   
@_date: 2019-03-25 16:31:16
Hope, you'll give us a chance in converting your cryptos someday. We've significantly developed processes and the whole flow of exchange so you are welcome to try!
@_date: 2019-03-27 13:05:18
We'd love to cooperate with you so that you could test our service in terms of quality, speed, exchange rates but, unfortunately, the way of collaboration you suggested is not quite suitable for us. However, we are developing Changelly loyalty program at the moment and can contact you once it's launched so you'll have an opportunity to become one of the first participants:)
@_date: 2019-03-25 12:44:57
Hi there! Could you please specify currency pairs whose exchange rates you weren't satisfied with?
@_date: 2019-03-25 12:40:54
Hi there! Could you please specify whether you'd like to buy BTC with fiat or buy crypto with another crypto? In case you are interested in purchasing BTC with GBP, your transaction will be processed via our card payments partner Simplex - [ If you are performing crypto-to-BTC swaps, you should be at least 16 years old or of other legal age, according to your relevant jurisdiction.

Hey! we do already support BCC/BCH, you are welcome to 
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:05:16
Hi guys! you can instantly exchange BCC/BCH on  - only 4 confirmations required, now limits!
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:09:09
Hey guys, thanks for your feedback! And welcome to 
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:44:10
We do have a notification that the user sees before they send us money. This notification implies a box a user must tick. Without doing that, they are unable to perform a transaction.
Once a user checks the box, they must be ready to provide the required information. If not ready, they must refuse from sending money to Changelly.
If the information provided by a user is controversial or not provided at all, we consider the funds are obtained fraudulently and act as the last legal entity in the whole exchange process by freezing the funds. This helps legal representatives investigate the issue and find the real money owner.
The whole controversy that took place was initiated by people who didn’t provide information to meet our requirements. The details sent comprise controversial data and fake photographs which, unfortunately, are not considered to be a clean funds proof.
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:49:35
Please note that if there are any issues with payments processing on our end and your funds are not converted yet, you may request a refund or a manual push for your transaction according to the current rate. We have no intention to rip off our customers. As soon as the issue is eliminated on our end, a transaction will be processed or refunded for sure. We would like that delays to be eliminated in crypto world, but that's not a realistic target, unfortunately. However, we are working on minimizing the number of them on our end. Also, it is important to mention that low rates are not beneficial for us as our commission is based on the final sum. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:06:28
Check out our guide oh how to exchange Bcash to Bitcoin: 
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:19:52
Hello! We have no aim to steal anything from our customers, blame them and will never do as we respect all users trading on our service. If you had any issues with us, please specify so we could discuss them. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:57:25
Please keep in mind that we always try to notify our users when there are delays or overloads in the crypto space. You may find this information on our main page before making transactions. Also, you are always welcome to ask our support team if there are any issues. However, the cryptocurrency world is very shifting and unpredictable and it's impossible to predict all delays. So could you please tell us what happened with your transaction?
@_date: 2019-10-31 18:14:59
Hey!  
No, it won't be possible. First of all, please note that Changelly is a non-custodial service - it means that we don't store customers' funds at all. The flow of the exchange (ERC-20 token to BTC) will be untraceable as there are 2 pretty different blockchains.  
Firstly, your funds will be delivered to our intermediary ERC-20 token's wallet. After that, we'll make bids and asks on the trading platforms, then select and suggest the best available rate at the moment of your exchange. Following that, the exchanged BTC amount will be sent from our intermediary Bitcoin wallet created especially for this very transaction. 
Should you have other questions, please don't hesitate to ask!
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:31:59


Hello! Could you please specify the things you identify as sketchy on our service?
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:01:49
We never guarantee that the rate will be fixed and always warn our customers that the amount is estimated. But we do guarantee that the rate your money is being exchanged at is the best at the given moment.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:06:28
Dear, we are trusted by over 100K active traders. Each exchange may have issues. We are always opened to investigate and help our customers as quick as we can.
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:01:29
Hello! Please take into account that fiat-to-crypto transactions are performed via our card payments providers: Simplex and Indacoin. Could you please kindly specify what currency are you interested in so we could forward your question to the appropriate partner? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:15:44
Dear braham, as you see the post update, we've refunded and do apologies before the customer.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:18:49
Dear customer, our apologies for the issue. Bitcoin blockchain is heavily overloaded with unconfirmed transactions. In your case most probably we should wait for a few days to prevent double spend. Then if the transaction does not appear in the blockchain, we will resend funds! Anyway please, contact our support we will assist you.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:34:49
That's true, unfortunately. We are still experiencing delays in support after the Bitcoin cash flash weekend. BTW if you check our reddit or twitter, most of the customers were already refunded. We have 7 full time support persons. But we are also humans, we can't just raise our team twice in one one day, once the number of transactions was increased dramatically one week ago. Hope that makes sense!
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:34:52
Dear Customer, we apologize for the issue for the failed transactions. We've replied to your support ticket in 24h, requested address for the refund. We suggest you further to wait for support answer before claiming. Unfortunately, our team is heavily overloaded with the BCH flash, answers may come a bit delayed, sorry. Trading on the highly speculative market is always risky.
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:37:13
We'd like to clarify the matter. Initially, we had an alert warning our users about the upcoming KYC check. Unfortunately, a lot of them ignored it and this caused the whole controversy. After that, we added a notification that the user can see before they send us money. This notification implies a box a user must tick. Without doing that, they are unable to perform a transaction. The notification system and the verification flow has been significantly improved and transactions subjected to KYC check are processed much faster and less stressful for our users. We hope that you'll give us chance to prove it in the future. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-02-18 08:35:45
First of all, we'd like to point out the fact that before performing a transaction on Changelly, every customer must familiarize and accept our ToS where we describe our KYC policies. In case your transaction may be subjected to the verification, you'll get the special alert at the Confirmation stage. If the user refuses to undergo the AML/KYC procedure, the transaction will be rejected and the crypto assets will be returned to where it originated from less any applicable fees. Secondly, we'd like to know what do you mean by "least convenient time"? If you are experiencing any issues with our service or had difficulties in the past, please specify them and we'll investigate the problem. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:22:21
Hey! As you can see the topic update, we've refunded the deposit in less than 24h.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:32:59
We need at least two confirmation to get money from you. Wil low fees, there is a high risk that the transaction will be confirmed only withing several days. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:49:10
Highly appreciated for your trust, thanks! 4051a26a18b9 is on the confirmation stage to your Monero wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:20:33
Hey! as you see the post update, we've refunded and do apologies before the customer.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:47:57

Keep working on providing a better experience for all our customers.

Why's that? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:30:18
Dear Customer, our apologies for the delayed withdrawal and late response, unfortunately we are still overloaded in support after the bitcoin cash flash. One of our exchange partners stuck the liquidity transfer. We are working to process your payment as soon as possible. Hope for your patience!
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:20:29
Dear Customer, our apologies for the delayed withdrawal.
as the amount was rather large, it took time for rebalancing liquidity from our exchange partner. Transactions were finished. Hope you've got funds!
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:04:25
We hope to deliver Monero in a few hours, once our trading partner send us liquidity.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:24:59
We are processing about 10K daily transactions up to 4K BTC daily exchange volume for 100K regular monthly traders. Hope that makes sense to trust us!

Hi there! All purchases fiat-to-crypto are performed by our card payments partner Simplex since we deal with crypto only. Should you have any questions regarding your transaction, please contact Simplex support at [support Also, we'd highly appreciate if you could mention what issues you had with our service so we could attend to the matter and assist you.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:13:31
What we are experiencing now is the growing pain. We keep monitoring all our users' suggstions to provide better customer experience. After the things took place this week, we decided to include some new features in our roadmap that will enhance the customer support. One of these is the expansion of our capacity to process ten times more transactions at once. 
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:21:01
Hello! Please note that fiat-to-BTC transactions are performed by our card payments provider Simplex that requires ID for the verification. As regards altcoin-to-BTC exchanges, you don't have to provide your ID. Hope for understanding!
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:58:00
Thanks! We have grown our team 4 times since summer. But can't disagree, market is growing faster, than we can educate more people for crypto industry!
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:24:11
We are hedging most of the deals on our exchange partners orderbooks - Poloniex, Bittrex and others. In some cases for large transactions it may take time for liquidity rebalancing. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:19:47
Hey! as you see the post update, we've refunded and do apologies before the customer.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:27:41
Dear, great thanks for your warm feedback! We are totally agree with you. Usually we are solving issues in 24h or even earlier. But recent Bitcoin cash flash caused a lot of issues due to abnormal overload - 5 times higher volume than usual! Unfortunately we are still overloaded in support, we can't just expand our team twice in one day. But we are doing our best to help customers as quick as we can!
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:33:36
Hey! We don't suspend transactions. The transaction in question was successfully completed on our end and all funds in full were delivered to the XMR wallet that had been indicated as a recipient one by the user.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:06:48
We've learned some thing from this week. We'll be working on implementing better methods to prevent such kind of issues. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:23:56
We never promise to lock the rates. If you take a look at the transaction process attentively, you will see that the amount is estimated. This word is written in capital letters against the field with the amount to get. We never hide this information. We are sorry that you didn't notice that. 
However, we would like to emphasize that all your transactions were exchanged at the best rate possible at that moment.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:18:33
Dear customer, thanks for your feedback! as you see the post update, we've refunded and do apologies before the topic starter.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:48:25
We share your frustration and feel the same way. These days we've processed as many transactions as we could. Over the last weekend, we've processed over 10,000 transactions with BCH.The demand was taken to the extreme, so we had to fail some transactions in order to prevent the collapse. Currently, we're working on providing all assistance needed. Depending on the wish of our customers, we either fully refund failed transactions or push them through at the current rate. Trading cryptos at the pick is always risky due to technical issues related to the blockchain. We hope that you understand it. 
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:06:16
Hi there! Seems that we've already replied to you in our sub. So, your transaction was completed on our end (we sent you the transaction hash - please kindly check). If you still haven't received your money, you can sync your wallet with the blockchain &amp; update it. Also, what wallet did you use for your exchange? You may contact its support team and provide the hash as well so they could dig into the issue on their end.  
Please stay tuned and let us know once the issue is resolved.
@_date: 2019-12-27 14:02:47
Hello! Why do you think so? You may check our current rates and compare them to other exchange services. We are offering considerable exchange rates and you can easily evaluate it. We'd be glad to hear about your experience.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:55:35
Dear Customer, our apologies for the issue. Seems to be resolved from now!
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:53:30
Dear slacknation, thanks for your remark! We are asking for the email to save your transactions history and give you a support hand, if needed. But if you prefer to stay anonymous, you may register by any fake email, as we don't require it's confirmation!
@_date: 2018-11-30 10:46:06
Hello! May we know what happened with your transaction? Was it completed on our side? Btw you are always welcome to contact our support team at [support in case you are experiencing any complications with our services. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:16:03
Hello, 
We're aware of this issue and we will solve it this week. If you look further at our exchange steps you won't find any "Bitcoin Core" mentions. There is only one page which we will surely correct. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:09:31
Hello! In case your transaction was under verification for a week, please specify its number so we could investigate the issue with the delay.Also, please indicate what fees you mean as our fee for crypto-to-crypto transactions is always stable and stands at 0,5% from the final amount.
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:12:30
You are welcome. We are happy to hear that everything is ok now. Hope to see you on Changelly soon:)
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:07:35
Hello! Usually, the verification takes a few hours but it depends on the difficulty of the case. Have you already contacted our security team at [security so that they could guide you through the whole process?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:24:37
Thank you for the info! We checked the transaction and it seems that you didn't send us your BTC for exchanging. Please, check the wallet addresses and get back to us.
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:17:27
Please note, that we are not responsible for fiat-to-crypto rates as we deal with crypto only. Also, we don't have RDD listed on our services so there must be some kind of confusion. In case you have any complications with your transaction on Changelly, we'd like to know its number so we could look into it and understand what happened with your exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:02:45
Hey guys, let us clarify.  
We charge 0.5% for each crypto-to-crypto exchange. Fees are included to the rate, it's pretty clear on the calculation page. However we don't fix the rates, as we have no amount restrictions and crypto is usually highly volatile. That's why final amount me be slighly differ from the estimates. But we do guarantee that your crypto funds will be exchanged instantly at the best available rate, once we get confirmation of your payment in blockchain!  
And yes, we are going to support Segwit soon. We are not lucky with the another possible 2x hard fork!  
You are welcome to 
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:04:29
Hey Eric! We generate input Segwit addresses to accept transactions from SegWit wallets with lower commission fees. It's not just accept segwit transactions on regular addresses. And we are almost ready to support outgoing SegWit transactions - next step on Segwit adoption. That is exactly what we announced!
@_date: 2017-09-27 07:22:11
Hey! Fees are included in our calculation rates. In some cases, we offer betters rates for some pairs, in other cases, our competitor does. Our main advantage is that we have no amount restrictions. You can exchange up to 200-300 BTC without KYC for the best available rate.
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:02:46
Hey Eric! Did you ever pass the transaction via Changelly? Our exchange fees are always included to the estimated rates.
@_date: 2017-09-27 07:28:01
Hey! Each service may have issues. If you check clearly all the public posts about us, you'll realise, that we always investigate the issues. in case of our fault we make a refund or compensation to the customer.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:27:21
Yep, we will make statement, once we support Segwit! More transactions on Segwit addresses are reducing the probability of 2X hard fork.
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:49:16
Hey! now it's supported for BTC out coming transactions!
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:15:04
We have 500K customers on board since launch at 2015. We are processing up to 5000 daily transactions with 1000-2000 BTC daily exchange volume. We have a lot of reputable partners like Jaxx, Coinomi, Coinmarketcap, Coinpayments, NEM/XEM, NXT and others. You can find a lot of reviews from our satisfied customers on reddit, twitter, bitcointalk, trustpilot and other sources. We hope that make sense!
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:12:32
BTW, we are working on our mobile app =)
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:35:23
That message is about regular network transaction fees. Most of the  services charge you on withdrawal.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:08:24
Thanks! Actually we prefer to stay neutral, not shouting like we are against 2X. We are not lucky with the new possible hard fork, even is that's profitable for exchanges business. We are definitely going to support Segwit asap!
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:10:00
Hey guys! We respect all our competitors. And we don't like to play politics, even we like flaming wars sometimes =) We are here just to provide you with the best exchange service and follow the community needs! You are very welcome to 
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:52:10
Thanks! It's misunderstanding, as we've integrated just recently. We will discuss with our partner Coinomi, how to make things clear for the wallet customers.
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:32:30
Dear User,
We have already answered you in numerous subreddits. KYC and AML are necessary for preventing money laundering and scamming.  We don’t support scammers and never did. Therefore, we can not send the funds back if they are stolen. That’s why we need verification.  Although sending documents does not stand for anonymity in the cryptoworld, transfering stolen funds is a much worse problem. We still haven’t recieved any information from you, that is suspicious. Are you pretending to be a victim?
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:40:47
Dear user,
Your transaction has been successfully finished. We are sorry for the delay caused by necessary KYC procedure meant to protect our users and service from stolen funds.  We appreciate your cooperation and have added you to whitelist - now you can exchange coins without any background checks and delays. Hope to see you again on Changelly!

We value our customers’ anonymity, so we ask for KYC only if the transaction is detected as suspicious. Besides, the user will see the warning about transaction being subject for KYC check before the final step of the transaction. We are transparent and straightforward about our intentions.

Hey guys! Changelly official is here. Let us clarify. USDT is a token, not fiat. USD rates are provided by our bank processing partner. Unfortunately it's something our of our control. It includes bank commission and covers fraud risks, as payment verification process is super quick and easy. In case of high rates, we always notify your to check that before payment. Hope that's fair! We are in process of integration new partner to provide better fiat rates. However for crypto-crypto instant exchanging we offer almost the best rates on the market. You are welcome to

That's true. Unfortunately, for instant credit card payments for crypo, there is a lot of fraud. Blockchain operations are irreversible, but the customer can always ask the bank for charge back. Otherwise, you should go through a complex verification process, such as Coinbase, and wait for a few days to process your payment.

Dear Strompy, you may check again, we've alerted you on the main and calculation pages - "USD/EUR rates are slightly high now, sorry. Please check rates attentively before payment", in case of our partner experiencing lack of liquidity and high rates.

Hello! Fiat-to-crypto transactions are processed on our card payments partners' side, hence ID is required. For crypto-to-crypto transactions, no ID is needed.
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:59:16
Actually you will be surprised, a lot of people are buying even with the high rates alert. When our processing partner experienced lack of liquidity we've tried to halt USD payments, but customers were asking us to get back USD. So we've reached the compromise with notification to let customers make their own choice.
