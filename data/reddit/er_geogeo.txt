Batching could be implemented right now, and would have a huge effect on deflating the mempool. They're consuming a huge portion of the blocks (in the 9h of outage, mempool went down 30MB). If they implemented batching their transactions would shrink massively (80-90% reduction per output), the mempool would deflate A LOT and fees would be affordable again for everyone, even them. 
Right now Coinbase is passing the costs on the customers, fucking EVERYONE in the process. Their incompetence/malice is just astounding, they're costing the whole space millions of $ in fees, I can't believe their duct-taped software sucks that much that they can't afford a complete rewrite. They just need to fix their hot wallet, like any other exchange... WTF.

Antifragile properties emerge from a system under many different shapes. We're at 13-14k$, withstanding a lot of attacks. This one is no different, it's analogous to a spam attack, only funded by noobs who don't know any better.
The fact that we're talking how a bad actor is damaging bitcoin IS the basis for the counterattack, antifragility doesn't fall from the sky, so stop with these dumb replies. "The market will take care of it", but WE'RE the market, we're discussing how to deal with it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:14:43
I'd upvote this comment a thousand times if I could. You really understand the core of the problem: the base layer hosts Bitcoin's monetary policy, and if you're not running a node you're simply trusting someone else telling you it's being followed along all its rules. And [trusted third parties are security holes](
Even if you wanted to do onchain transactions on gigablocks, the safer and obvious way to do it would be on a mergemined sidechain. Should it fail for whatever reason, we'd still have the capacity to convalidate the base layer, and we wouldn't have destroyed this beatiful project of limited sound money, all for "muh fees".
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:16:38
Of course. Right now the LN specification 1.0 doesn't support larger sizes, but via the BOLT process LN will get better in future implementations. LN is not a consensus critical piece of software, it can be developed at its own pace. Another great advantage of using layers to upgrade Bitcoin.

It's not like it's any different from the actual running network we have today (OP_RETURN embedded data). If mining is to be decentralized you still need a native decentralized token without counterparty risk, otherwise the blockchain wouldn't be decentralized: if miners are paid in FEDcoins issued onchain, the mining is dependendent on the counterparty called FED and we could just let it sign the blocks directly.
The treechain concept is exactly that and it still presupposes that there's a basic native payment in the chain- parsing @_date: 2017-03-26 18:38:50

@_date: 2016-01-21 11:54:52
I highly recommend to read Paul Sztorc ["Measuring Decentralization"]( since it discusses in depht the really important differences between soft and hard-forks, which are NOT limited to a simple easiness of upgrade.
Bitcoin should be as unmovable as possible, since any kind of change in its hard-coded rules (i.e. hard forks), no matter how small, could open countless subtle attacks. Soft-forks, since they are more restrictive on the set of rules, do not threaten that set of hard rules we call Bitcoin.
Always assume that an hard-fork attempt, no matter the team, is an attack to the current Bitcoin software; do not evaluate the proposed changes by trusting the majority or the minority since they are easily gameable (e.g. censorship, sockpuppetry, Sibyl attacks); remember that any hard-fork obliterates all the cumulative security you can indirectly evaluate by looking on how the old set of hard-rules fared so far under an adversary environment. 
Bitcoin must resist itself and its successors, or it could fall to the centralization charade: the idea of regular scheduled hard forks is incredible dumb, since it will obviously lead to developer centralization. You'll trust the dev in charge instead of a set of hard-rules you need to evaluate only once.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:26:26
Yeah the attack on the minority chain is probably a bluff unless he's really paid by someone who profits by Bitcoin's destruction.
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:25:16
I think it's just cheap talk, and the bluff will be called using the UASF. I think that Jihan got a short position, and tried to make easy money with this whole BU story. I'm waiting for UASF to be reviewed sufficiently before recommending it, but I guess it's one of the best option if this charade doesn't resolve itself within the signalling period. Of course it could be something way more sinister, like actual involvement of China's gov, in order to suppress the privacy gains of SW. Who knows.

@_date: 2017-03-27 12:57:45
Thanks for the link. Right, UTXO growth is the real problem long-term, it's preferable to put the UTXO set in RAM, which is really expensive compared to mere HDD. A dumb increase in blocksize would exacerbate the problem a lot.
I wonder if our problems with privacy are connected to the UTXO problem. In order to increase privacy regarding one's possessions, we use HD wallets, many different addresses and mixers, but for the network it would be better to have 1 UTXO per user. With confidential transactions we could try to achieve that. And if I'm not mistaken, MimbleWimble is great because the blockchain size is connected only to the UTXO set, everything else can be pruned.
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:49:17
The thing is that many of those altcoins have even worse scalability properties. The balance model of Ethereum for example is pretty expensive compared to UTXOs (that lets you have concurrency). Monero can't prune.
They hide their problem well since they have permanent inflation and are managed like companies with PR  :')
I thought the altcoin phase of 2013 was bad with those "12s blocks! We're so faaaast compared to Bitcoin", now blocksize is all the rage :/
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:25:31
The absurd thing is that LN improves usability in payments so much that it makes it better than PayPal! Yet he's pushing for the dumb brute-force strategy of blocksize. 
Hell, with all this bickering, he could've started a federated sidechain approach (similar to Elements Alpha) with coinbase, bitpay and other companies, for a fraction of the cost of the propaganda shills he paid, and he could have those cheap payments he so much aneals to, right now, with minimal change in wallet code. That would be a productive and capitalistic endeavour, and I would use it and give him fees! 
But no! "MUH HARDFORK"
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:37:39
You're not wrong. That's why we should strive to judge only by code, and be EXTREMELY conservative regarding any change. 
We could have new pseudoanonymous identities for any new BIP submitted changing consensus code, so that hijacking known developers is useful only in vetoing and not for rallying around (like "Gavin was chosen by Satoshi, I'll follow him!"); an attacker wouldn't have automatically access to make changes in the code, only mantaining it. It would make discussions regarding change of consensus code a bit more civil.
So far I haven't heard of MimbleWimble (introduced by Tom Elvis Jedusor, same idea as Satoshi) as a KkkoreBorgStream conspiracy, so maybe it works.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:23:09
You're right pal, my mistake. Then throwagasm69 needs to read my comment. I repeat, cash means bearer instrument, the word is not correlated at all at the transactions costs.
I guess I got on the defensive because many in the BU camp have this strange fetishization regarding the word "cash", thinking that it means cheap. 
Paying in banknotes is not cheap at all, here in Italy there's a max cap of 1000€ and I incur in change problems all the time. And there are many payment systems, practically free, that use SEPA and internal networks, which means that Bitcoin is not that competitive in that regard.
Since I lived in a country that printed money on a massive scale (the italian Lira was really bad lol), I understand what really makes Bitcoin valuable. Roger Ver instead seems pretty convinced on making it Paypal 2.0, only worse.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:41:13
I'll copypaste a recent post I made:
But the problem is bandwidth and latency, not storage. All Core devs know this, I mean they implemented pruning in order to help with the storage part of mantaining a full node. I'm lucky and I've got a gigabit connection w/ 200mbps upload, with a ZFS rack of 24TB, yet I understand that 1MB of the blocks is not the same as a 1MB of storage.
The problem is: how fast can you push 1MB in 10 minutes on a P2P network? Consider that the orphan rate is proportional to that: if you take 1 minute, your orphan rate will be 10%. If you take 6 seconds, your orphan will be a whopping 1%! 1% chance that you will lose all your reward and electricity!
But, if you're centralized... It's always 0%. Can you see the perverse incentive now?
If you're a big miner, your orphan rate will be lower than that of a little miner. If you're a big miner, bigger blocks help in pushing the orphan rate higher for the little miner, with little effect on you.
BU makes the absolutely insane decision to make miners king on this. At least Bitcoin XT and Classic had the decency of making it knowable and predictable. With the [median EB attack]( they can push further and further the competition out with little cost. Many proposals of dynamic capsize are gameble, which is why we use a fixed value for blocksize.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:17:39
It's not a miner's problem. It's a P2P problem. This network is not structured like a client-server one, so you won't see the nice pings you need to make blocks larger. You need to understand the real limitations of a P2P network UNDER ACTIVE ATTACK. 
Right now miners collaborate and use a really fast relay network, but that doesn't work under adversarial conditions. Toomim measured the limits and it was safe around 4MB! There's the Chinese Firewall between us, and that destroys a lot of assumptions you're making about bandwidth and latency. It's a really bad situation. You need to understand fully the selfish mining attack in order to see why huge blocksizes aren't viable.
The most important thing is that you understand that having a dynamic cap right now is suicidal, because of the attack I mentioned. If that's so, then you can see why supporting BU is a bad idea. We can discuss further regarding other non-dynamic proposals, and even dynamic ones (flexcap is an interesting one).

If it did, it's now settling down. The most important thing in this picture is that the cost of entry in mining is arbitrary and manipulable by the biggest miner, ad infinitum. If there's instead a cap, it would be reached at some point. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 12:27:13
A soft fork is a change to the Bitcoin protocol to make it more restrictive. A hard fork, in contrast, is a change to the Bitcoin protocol which makes it more permissive.
If I want to know that I've been paid without trusting someone else (i.e. running a node), I'm immune to soft-forks since they are fancy rules on top on what I'm accepting as a payment. An hard-fork instead mandates and dictates that I upgrade to even stay on the same network. I don't care whether someone somewhere is using a new fancy rule called soft-fork, I'm immune to it if I'm running a node.

No, it's a different attack, that becomes viable once 25-33% of the mining is separated from the rest. Here's an article:
Right now it's not that much viable, but we must assume the worst. The chinese firewall makes it a bit easier to perform.
No, nevermind, you don't need it to fully understand the limits of the P2P network. You need to consider it when you evaluate the pros and cons overall of an increase. My mistake of wording.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:22:43
EDIT: this post was changed in order to make it non-confrontational.
I'll explain in more detail.
Cash = bearer instrument. Gold is cash. A bank balance is IOUs.
Bitcoin is only a bearer instrument as long as the network is decentralized and you can run a node to verify your UTXOs yourself, otherwise you're trusting a third party, and [third parties are security holes]( The whole point of Bitcoin is that you don't have to trust anyone but the code you run. If you can't run a node, then you're better off using already existing payment systems like Venmo and others.
I don't understand why the BU camp fetishizises that word, thinking that cash means that it's cheap to transact. I guess Paypal with no fees is cash then?
Paying in banknotes is not cheap at all, here in Italy there's a max cap of 1000€ and I incur in change problems all the time. And there are many payment systems, practically free, that use SEPA and internal networks, which means that Bitcoin is not that competitive in that regard.
Since I lived in a country that printed money on a massive scale (the italian Lira was really bad lol), I understand what really makes Bitcoin valuable. Roger Ver instead seems pretty convinced on making it Paypal 2.0, only worse.
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:23:26
The problem with compact blocks is that it doesn't work under adversarial conditions. You have to assume the worst under active attack.

@_date: 2017-03-25 16:12:38
I appreciate that you see BU as the clusterfuck that is, and you're for more sane and rational hard-forks. However pushing for a hard-fork in this climate means that you're helping for the most possible option of them all, which is BU. If you understand that SegWit is a blocksize increase comparable to a 2MB hard-fork, why should you push a hardfork before SegWit? Let's get SegWit activated, and then we can restart the debate in a more sane environment (without the BU dumbfucks).
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:49:56
I'm not particularly sure about this, but I remember that the balance model of Ethereum doesn't let you have easily [concurrency]( in the same blocks. The UTXO model instead does, because it's a directed acyclic graph.
Someone corrects me if I'm wrong.
EDIT: found an article that explains this point in detail: 
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:09:28

@_date: 2017-03-27 11:46:22
Well you can change the blocks to 2MB base and change the discount in order to make it 4MB max under SegWit. There would be more space for UTXOs, with the same size. It would make sense if we implement Schnorr, it would shrink the weight of signatures a lot, so maybe you could expand the UTXO space without changing the total bandwidth requirement.
But I think the most productive course of action would be a good, non-gameble flexcap proposal with some hardfork wishlist fixes. Or even extension blocks or a sidechain for those bigblockers.

Here's a thorough economic explanation from Sztorc, on why it's always the same wasted work (marginal revenue = marginal rent + marginal cost, ALWAYS):
It's just preference at this point. The wasted economic activity is the same, but with PoS you get absurd complicated messes that border on circular logic (the blockchain determines itself), while with PoW you're sure that it's thermodynamically irreversible, and it's easy (less attack surface).

Samurai recently implemented the support for a specified node to be queried, so you can point the wallet to your node only.
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:53:35
It's not even a problem regarding the miner's connection (if that was the case, you could answer that it's their problem in getting a faster internet), but it's the latency in hopping on the P2P network. Under attack miners can't use the fast relay network, and have to push their block to the majority of nodes as soon as possible (&lt;6s for 1% orphan). Even with 100mbit upload for all nodes, that's not easy! Add in the validation on every hop, the Chinese Firewall and you can start to see why devs regard 4MB the maximum possible right now.
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:14:56
Right, we need to hard-fork sooner or later to adopt a better blocksize solution. But you have to understand that hardforks should be done only as a last-measure.
I disagree with the notion that SegWit is closer to an hard-fork than a soft-fork: when i run a node I only deeply care to validate transactions that pertain to me, not the ones of others. It's a problem for those who rely on SPV though, not that it's different with an hard-fork.
SegWit will be adopted like P2SH was, so I don't see the problem if old nodes can't fully validate the chain and degrade to SPV security for those new transactions. Still it doesn't change anything regarding my ability to know that I've been paid using the old rules.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:41:52
The main application is that it enables you to go sub-satoshi in your payments, without changing the actual consensus rules regarding divisibility. It means that once it's implemented, LN will let you do nanopayments!
Other than that, maybe it's useful for some kind of lottery?

It's really hypocritical of Roger to talk about financial freedom and then condone miners trying to kill a minority chain that merely follows its rules. Seems pretty much a violation of the NAP.

I do think that the current attack from BitMain is caused by their uncertainty to mantain  edge. Now that ASICs got to 16nm, there are no more huge surprises in development since we reached Moore, and the market on the long run would punish them. So they pushed the centralization incentives into overdrive by promoting BU and its inane blocksize algorithm that would make Jihan the king forever.
If that's the case, maybe we can just scare them enough with the threat of PoW change, without actually pursuing it and punishing cooperating miners like BitFury in the process. We just need to resist attacks on the Core chain long enough to see a better competition in the mining landscape.
Should we change the PoW, the ASIC armrace would begin from 0 and maybe land on the same situation as today.
Just my 2cents.

Your idea of a proxy service for lightning is still interesting: with schnorr signatures a trusted entity could push a lot of transactions from many lightning channels to many on-chain recipients using just a single signature. It wouldn't be trustless but seems useful for privacy and fees.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:41:42
Yeah, we can always use higher layers. I still want CT on L1, because it improves a lot the coinjoin process... so much that it reaches pretty good levels of privacy. Even if CT is a bit massive with those KB transactions it may be worth it if you use it on LN.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:57:31
Yes, with Schnorr the whole coinjoin weighs only one signature, which means the more the merrier and everyone is better off in fees!
With CT the coinjoin privacy aspect is improved a lot. You don't have to worry about change, and anyone can join at anytime. If you have blinding of inputs/outputs (coinjoin) with blinding of amounts (CT), Bitcoin becomes pretty much opaque, with really good privacy.
We still have TumbleBit should CT not make it, so I'm not that worried.

I'm an AnCap and I must say that many voluntarists and ancaps are pretty naive regarding social engineering attacks, so much that they are easily swayed by the "censorship!" argument. Well, maybe Reddit in general is gone to shit. The shilling lately has become unbearable, and it's a problem common to many subs, not only this one.
Scaling is a technical issue, not a political one. As long as decentralization is intertwined to the blocksize, and as long as nodes aren't rewarded in a non-gameble way, we can't use a "market approach" to blocksize. BU is pretty much a plutocratic one to boot, since miners vote on the blocksize, and like all voting, that's not capitalistic. Capitalism is not about “one dollar, one vote”, it is instead “one dollar risked, one vote”. Capitalism requires the potential for gain as well as the risk of loss. With voting, gains for “good votes” are public, and equally and widely dispersed (no potential for private gain), and voting is free (no private risk of loss). BU pushes all the operating costs on the nodes and minor miners, not on the bigger miners who propose the increase (or decrease!), meaning that it privatizes profits while socializing costs.

By default it implements strong privacy! You think you can implement KYC given that? I for one will run it on Tor, and I will not give two fucks :')
Since it's a low barrier to entry the cost of defection is extremely low. Which means that LN nodes that try to implement KYC/AML will be at a disadvantage, it costs money and there's better competition that can't be outlawed without that overhead .

If you're a big miner, your orphan rate will be lower than that of a little miner. If you're a big miner, bigger blocks help in pushing the orphan rate higher for the little miner, with little effect on you.
BU makes the absolutely insane decision to make miners king on this. At least Bitcoin XT and Classic had the decency of making it knowable and predictable. With the [median EB attack]( they can push further and further the competition out with little cost. Many proposals of dynamic capsize are gameble, which is why we use a fixed value for blocksize.

It's still variance. Take a look at the 8MB and segwit, notice that it's nearly the same percentage of the BU increase. It will go back to the 40-42% that reached a week ago, I don't think they expanded much.
We have instead new minor pools being against BU, which is great improvement as opposed to their previous tacit consent of the bullies.

Nah, I'm a libertarian and still think that Bitcoin is embued of those values. Yeah I can see other values converging, but we're talking about a trustless deflationary money that strongly enforces property rights via cryptography (it doesn't get much more libertarian than that).
It's just that I recognize that there are better people than me regarding coding and computer science. Since scaling is a technical solution and not a political one, I'll let them handle that.

And we have historical precedent for that: during the ETH hardfork, when ETC was listed on Poloniex it had very little support of miners. But they rapidly defected, because there was money to be made mining ETC.
You'll reply that ETH has rapid adjustment time so ETC didn't suffer much yadda yadda yadda, but try to understand the important thing here: miners DEFECTED once there was enough money to be made mining ETC. As long as core users resist and give their chain value even with slow confirmation times, it will be mined on. Guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:43:12
It doesn't seem extreme because it isn't. SegWit increases the block to 4MB maximum, and it's still acceptable. However the network can't sustain much more than that, even with a 100mbit line. You need 0,3s per hop (without validation!), and need to reach &gt;51% of the nodes as soon as possible (&lt;4-6s) in order to assure your reward if you can't contact other miners. But a lot of nodes don't have that upload! Double or triple that value as an engineering safeguard, add in the Chinese Firewall and you see that there's not much room to work with. 4MB is OKish right now, 32MB certainly not.
Of course right now miners send their blocks in a relay network, because they're playing nice. If one of them controls &gt;33%, it's worth attacking the network. I don't know if the attack can be subtle and hard to recognize, for that you need to ask Peter Todd.

Before attacking a coin you need to be able to short it :)
Remember the DAO hacker? He didn't count on getting value out of a broken ETH, instead he shorted ETH before launching the attack and gained millions of $ in BTC.
There are currently no good exchanges with deposit open and short options, so it doesn't make sense to do it now (especially since an everyone expects it to dump initially). An attacker will appear once those conditions I listed are satisfied, especially under a pump rally.

ASICBOOST lets you save electricity, which means that yes, they got 40% of the hashing rate, but at a discount (which means that they're overinvested, so to speak). If they tried to attack they would have to spend a lot more electricity in order to sustain the attack, making it way more infeasible than assumed!
And the other cheated miners are furious right now I bet, it's safe to assume that they're on the segwit side in case of a UASF. They want the Jihan empire DEAD, and we users too!

I, personally, first heard it from Peter Todd: “The only full node that matters is yours.”**
And what does that mean? That you can't know if someone inflated Bitcoin monetary supply without checking every single block, and SPV can't do that. You would sacrifice every single useful Bitcoin propriety, and it would really resemble an inefficient Paypal. Better give a read to the essay I linked, before you propose even dumber ideas.

It would be socialistic if I'd advocate locking or sequestering the coinbases Jihan mined. I don't. If SHA256 was broken by magic quantum computers only the NSA had, would you still use Bitcoin with that mining algo? No? Well no shit, we'd fix that. Same logic with ASICboost. Miners must take in the possibility of PoW change in their economic calculation. If disaster happens, too bad.
It's cheating only if you're discovered, congrats Jihan. Now expect a reaction from the other 60% of miners. They'll rapidly adopt your solution and if they can't, they will signal SegWit as fast as they can. The cat is out of the bag.

As I said it's a combination of both liquidity and monetary/technological properties that determines its chance at being money. Bitcoin is still inferior regarding liquidity to the USD, yet its monetary and technological properties attracted enough liquidity to bootstrap it into a somewhat usable money. It's worse at being money than USD in many areas, because it lacks liquidity.
If Bitcoin had the same technological and monetary properties of the USD with a worse liquidity would anyone use it? Of course not! Same thing applies to altcoins.
If the money offers marginal improvements, its liquidity will be marginal and so it will be worse at being money, just look at the alts market cap. Bitcoin offers a new world in respect to fiat, altcoins not so much in respect to Bitcoin.

It's just a realisation that on the free market the better money wins over because the universe wants a single liquid money, and what constitutes good is a combination of both liquidity and technological properties. A new and illiquid cryptocurrency must be as revolutionary compared to bitcoin as bitcoin was compared to fiat; otherwise it can't attract enough liquidity to sustain itself against a more liquid money. And remember that, should this new crypto divest enough liquidity from bitcoin to cause a price fall, it will be easy to incorporate the source code of the competitor in the bitcoin core.

@_date: 2017-05-28 09:25:49
But ASICboost works only in the legacy chain, and it only makes you save electricity (you still need the ASICs). If we assume that they're using all the ASIC they own and that they're enjoying 20% savings on electricity to produce the hashrate we see right now, the attack on the UASF will cost much more than you think. Jihan will probably try everything to discredit the UASF idea in order to prolong any gains he can enjoy right now, but won't be actively attacking the chain given a good 25+% miner support.
If we had a future market right now we could actually know if UASF is gonna win. A price higher than 30% than legacy would cause even his bribed miner buddies to defect and switch.

Your reply was a tad late, mate ;)
Potential liquidity is still an economic good. Let's say there's a stable, good business that falls short due to an economic recession. They would love to have that extra liquidity in order to survive the bad times, and you would too, since it'd be a good investment, but you (and many others) are already locking funds in PoS... It's opportunity costs in the end.
I'm still of the opinion that you need a PoW substratum in order to achieve decent security (and remember, PoW is not completely invalidated even in the face of a 51% attack, since rewriting history is still very costly (given decentralized nodes)). 
PoS makes too many assumptions in this regard. PoW+PoS may work... PoS alone maybe can be implemented in a sidechain, if you timestamp it regularly with Bitcoin's PoW.
@_date: 2017-07-14 08:54:59
It doesn't surprise me, and it reminds me of the power law 80:20. If I remember correctly, UTXOs worth less than 7$ constitute nearly 70% of the total number nodes have to store... There is a lot of little activity that still amounts to be worth not that much.

To be frank, you're better off starting with a simple multisig federated chain (which can be implemented RIGHT NOW) and then converting it to a merged mining configuration later if the softfork activates, like Rootstock is planning to do.

The "propagation work amortization" is also known as "weak blocks". It must be written first... With the relay network working miners aren't that excited for it (it's redundant), it's good for the P2P network tho.
If I remember it right, it needs to write something in the header/coinbaseOP and is thus incompatible with covert ASICboost.
The [orphan rate]( has gone down, so yes we can increase the blocksize. You know, Core wanted to study the effect of SegWit and its larger blocks first, and in the meanwhile implement schnorr sigs and MAST (which increases the tx efficiency, without wasting bandwidth). The mere blocksize parameter is the last thing you want to increase.
Again, Toomim's work suggested that because of China's Firewall the blocksize could only go up to 4MB. I guess it's more like 5MB today. SegWit gives you effective 2MB blocksize with a maximum of 4MB, so why are you so prone to hardfork just for a mere doubling? The HF part of SegWit2x is rushed. I would agree to HF if given enough time to implement other important things from the HF wishlist (see Spoonnet).
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:43:31
It's not that much expensive compared to a plain old bitcoin transaction (I remember around 400bytes if cooperative, a bit more if not?), it could be even smaller given schnorr. In other words, you should try to use LN as much as possible, and if a path is not found, create a new one with the one you're paying - old bitcoin transaction aren't as useful.
I still don't see the problem with LN. The sacrifices it makes in order to achieve unlimited scales are very limited! It's like a bank that can't defraud you in any way, that anyone can create from scratch at no cost, and that can at worst lock your funds for some period of time. It's lightyears ahead of any other competing solution, given you'd have to use centralized companies otherwise. If you fear this timeout period so much, then create various channels.

That of course it's true. Hopefully Segwit + LN + Liquid sidechain will make fees less heavy. 
A "positive" thing is that we've had concrete proof that Bitcoin as a system can work with decent security even counting only on fees (they reached a third of the coinbase reward). It was somewhat obvious given simple economic reasoning, but many said that we need perpetual inflation in order to have a working Bitcoin.

My point is that the first channels will be established with those you commerce with, not with complete strangers (even those don't have much to gain, except trolling I guess). By doing this the risk of temporary inconvenience of locked funds is even more reduced. The channel duration lenght is arbitrary, the longer the lock-in the more opportunities you have to check for fraud but the more time you have to wait to get your funds. A week is more than enough if you've got several other channels active, and given the 3rd party channel supervision tech.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:06:35
As long as the node you established the channel with is responsive the channel can last indefinetely. Say that you and your employer establish a channel worth 2 salaries. You can keep receiving and spending from-and-to that channel as long as your outcome equals your income. Should you instead starting spending more than you receive at some point the channel will be exhausted and you will need to reestablish it with other funds.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:12:55
* Channel capacity exhaustation is the most important one. If you keep sending or receiving funds in one way the channel will exhaust, and instead of paying negative fees trying to rebalance it, it may very well be more convenient to settle the channel and then recreate it with new funds.
* consolidation of received funds into cold storage (channels are "hot" storage, especially if you want to route others' transactions). The hardware wallets of today can certainly function with LN in a casual way, but I don't think the user experience would be great if you want to route a lot of transactions.
* you may want to partecipate in a special script transaction (LN should support everything Bitcoin does, though)
* you can't find anyone to route via LN to other sidechains/coins

Sztorc's argument is applicable to any given P2P system that exchanges value. The economic waste is always the same, since MR = MC always. If value is being generated, and given a P2P network (rent will tend to fall to zero) =&gt; marginal revenue will equal marginal costs. The attacker will always seek to attack as long as the attack costs less than (MR-MC).
You can say that PoS wastes less electricity, but in a way or another the same economic value is wasted. ETH's planned PoS sacrifices liquidity, for example, and that's an economic good just as any other.

To be specific, BIP141 implementation of SegWit blocks ASICboost. It's not a segwit only thing, any softfork upgrade that puts something in the coinbase header like segwit does would interfere with Jihan's cheap trick. If it wasn't segwit, it would have been something like fraud proofs. That's why Bitmain has this really strange hardfork fetish for segwit (and legions of dumbfucks from r/btc tried to excuse this as "cleaner code, with less technical debt" - nonsense). Even their softfork extblock proposal followed the same logic!
But now they've got no room left to go, they can't stall this thing anymore.

BIP148 was not merged since its controversiality rises from the fact that it may cause a chainsplit.

So it should be merged in order to protect users from a miner attack.

I really don't know if hardforking just to double the blocksize is worth it. 
Going forward I expect the ecosystem to support a big block sidechain, it would be great since fees are the only thing little miners risk missing out on (as opposed to the centralization of the base chain with its great coinbase reward, you would avoid completely emarginating little miners). With a sidechain you can be more rushed in decision making. 
Hardforking is in general a bad way to upgrade, it's always possible that a pernicious bug could suddenly destroy the network. Better way is to upgrade via layers.

No it doesn't? A sidechain can be mined like bitcoin proper. Miners only order transactions, all the heavy lifting is done by signature crypto and merkle trees (you don't need trusted third parties).
A drivechain just makes the following point: "miners stealing funds from a sidechain is similar to this attack: send BTCs to an exchange, wait 3 days to receive them on your bank account, and then re-org back the chain for 3 days in order to double spend those BTCs", which is only possible if you get a 51% hashpower. "If so, we can make stealing from a sidechain really unlikely by waiting months instead."
Even Bitcoin doesn't completely remove trusted third parties, you have to trust just a little that a 51% coalition is unlikely - and your fullnode software, of course. 
What's your point?
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:19:46
Sidechains were firstly described in detail in the blockstream paper, they use a SPV proof in order to unlock coins. Drivechains use a simpler multi-monthly mining voting process to do the same.

Why would the price going up be a negative? It means that it's more liquid. Liquidity is everything for money: now the market deals way better with movements in one way or the other, and can support bigger transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:04:33
* Elements Alpha was the first, it's been operational for more than a year on testnet.
* The Liquid sidechain is a federated one, many exchanges are partecipating in the project. They did a presentation recently: 
* Rootstock is working on testnet right now, I guess it'll start on mainnet within a month or two.
All of these sidechains are federated ones, they work by using a multisignature address and various other signers in order to work. They could be changed later to a drivechain model, using miners instead. (for the first two doesn't make sense, tho)
I guess a big block drivechain will be one of Sztorc's first proposal once his work is done.
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:21:47
* The chinese firewall introduces a lot of latency
* you want your blocks pushed to +50% of P2P nodes under 6 seconds if you want orphans to stay &lt;1% (since 10min=600s), given the worst possible condition (relay networks not working/under attack)
Now you can see why 20MB blocks are absolutely not viable. 4MB is pushing it. A 1MB in a P2P network that must be verified and transmitted as soon as possible, all while being under active attack, is not the same 1MB you download from Netflix.

The nice thing is that it would win even if it was just a fraction of the price, given there is a gap between the trading price and miners supporting it.
Say that UASF-coin trades for 1000$ but can be mined for 200$ vs a legacy-coin that trades at 2000$ but is mined at 1800$, and is always at the risk of total re-org wipeout... The fencesitters would switch in an instant.

Can you even consider the funds in the channel "locked up"? It may very well be the opposite, funds on LN are **more liquid** since they can be sent fastly anywhere without waiting for blocks. And 100mln people is a lot, the whole network nowadays has got no more than a few million partecipants. With 100mln price would go to the moon (a trillion $ market cap is possible, given that only a part of coins actually contribute to the cap).
I agree with you that sidechains will help accomodate many users at once, with that you can postpone the migration to the base chain layer for months/years.

The only way you can have a valid appcoin is when it's absolutely required to manage the monetary base in order to make the application work. If it doesn't, then the opensource code can be copied and modified in order to make it work with BTC. 
The only thing I can think of is those fiat tethers like bitUSD or Tether. ICOs are just drop-in shares for dumb projects...

Relay networks works only if miners are willing to partecipate - if there are no active attacks. Right now they cooperate, just because they can't otherwise (ie they're not willing to do a selfish mining attack - for now).
As I said the orphan rate is the only metric that a miner needs to watch out for. The bigger the hashrate portion a miner controls, the lower his orphan rate (since he knows the block he mines =&gt; 0% orphan). The smaller your hashrate portion, the higher the orphan rate (since you need to know ASAP the block the others are working on). And, it goes without saying, the bigger the block, the higher the orphan rate.
This is a perverse incentive. That's why Todd underlines how a bigger blocksize strongly incentivizes miner centralization.
IBLT is already implemented via compact blocks: 
(citing Gavin? Really?)
Relay networks in general are direct point-to-point miner connections. They can be attacked (or miners could simply refuse to partecipate). Don't count on them to design margin security parameters.
The only things left to implement regarding the P2P network are:
* changing from TCP to UDP
* weak blocks (which, again, needs miner cooperation)
* [BIP151]( that reduces the CPU overhead a bit
Sorry, but things like speed of light are a constant you can't change. In ideal conditions (a direct fiber connection to the antipode!) you still need 0.4s to propagate a block worldwide. Add to the mix routing, chinese firewall, block validation... If you're a miner, you want to stay under that 6s limit.
Orphan rates have empirically gone down thanks to the great work done by the devs. There's a world of difference between 0.12 and 0.14, for example. Now we can safely increment the blocksize. You still want that to be reasonable... 1-2 years ago 4MB was the max (toomim's study), I don't expect it to be that different (6MB?)

Thanks to him we got concrete evidence that yes, SegWit correlates strongly with an increase in price. He supported it and then withdrew signalling, did this two or three times, and the price followed to a T.

Yeah sorry, I rushed that post and yes it's unintelligible.
In the context of the article it's an explanation of Drivechains' particular method (in Blockstream's sidechain paper you have SPV proofs instead). It's a somewhat trusted third party: the whole process of miners voting in the open and over a huuuuge period of time is the trusted third party Sztorc is referring to.

According to [this piece]( speculative attacks against other currencies will become viable with a somewhat liquid 50+bln$ market cap.

Ah, so for now probabilistic payments is just a BOLT that needs to be written and implemented?

If both chains support fraud proofs you can have discrete security even if you only fully validate one of them. ["Cost of the option to create a new full node" aka CONOP is the best metric to measure decentralization]( so we still can't use ridicolous notions like unlimited blocks otherwise the other chain will be completely unverifiable at some point and miners will obviously begin to steal its funds.

Sidechains have fullnodes like Bitcoin proper, you don't have to trust third parties to validate their internal logic. What's missing though is validating inter-blockchains transfers from-and-to Bitcoin.
Sidechains can get new blocks either by:
* trusting many different signatories
* usual proof-of-work mining.
PoW may or may not be different from Bitcoin's SHA256. You could have a SHA3 sidechain, for example, and its security will then depend on the mining landscape of SHA3. If you want to "recycle" Bitcoin's miners you can use merge-mining, but this means that these miners could attempt to steal the sidechain's funds. How can we avoid that? Just make transfers a long multimonthly process. 
Why is this acceptable? Because should the majority of miners be malicious, you already accept the possibility of this attack: a majority of malicious miners could double spend exchanges' funds by doing a 3day re-org. If you accept that this attack is unlikely, then it will be even more unlikely over longer frames (like months), especially given how both chains are fully transparent and open to the public. 
By doing this transfers between chains can reach a decent security. Of course your funds on a sidechain are not as secure as those on a main-chain, but it's a decent tradeoff given their flexibility.
Tell me where you have to trust third parties? You can run fullnodes for both chains, you know that right?

That's a shame :(. How long would the additional script be in bytes?
Could probabilistic payments work with a somewhat trusted third party that notarizes them (and can show proof in case of a dispute?) I mean it wouldn't be LN proper, and at that point you would just use a centralized offchain server... Ah, maybe it can work with the "multisig" LN design.
I hoped that we wouldn't need to fork in order to deal with subsatoshi amounts... Well it's a luxury problem, it only makes sense with a price north of 1mln$ BTC :)

You're right. Now that I think about it, is the 1st August in the middle of a readjusment period?
