To new investors, Dont worry about the people who you see here badmouthing and spreading FUD about Bitcoin they have no leg to stand on when it comes to Bitcoins price, All you have to do is a little research and know that it doesnt matter if Bitcoin goes down after it goes way up because it has done this many many times, If Bitcoin was a professional baseball player it would be batting 1000, And even if the bubble does pop and it will still recover because it has recovered from that too.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:55:42

I cant believe the reasoning some people have. Why would you think that the fucking bubble is popping just because BTC hasnt allready gone to 25k? Three weeks ago people were astounded that Bitcoin was going to 10k and it now sits at 14,500.This is still a +50% increase in a few weeks so stop your bitching and crying and just do some research on the history of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:16:03
I am getting out of Bitcoin after the next rise to 20k+, I have no doubt in my mind that I have lost tens of thousands by holding my BTC and selling my lucrative alts to buy more BTC whenever there are surges in the price, many of the alts I sold have gone up 5-15x after I sold
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:34:18
Allready in a downtrend because of holidays and tax season and this Korean thing which isnt that big a deal has tipped the scale a little more south, next week we should see BTC back to its bullish glory

There's no reason why you can't put that amount into alts and turn it into more than 100k next year....you don't need Bitcoin to do it. EOS is going to make Bitcoin look like a lemonade stand in a year.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:12:16
It could go down to 10k or up to 25k...hard to tell, all I know is that Bitcoin is up 1500% from a year ago so I would say that now is a good time to buy because history shows that there is high probability that Bitcoin will go much higher in the next year and beyond

It gets withdrawn through sell orders overwhelming the buy orders, however, you have a good point since someone will always be holding that bitcoin unless is burned or forgotten, It will have less value though if there is no buying support at any price level

Altcoins are a good way to fund legit projects and at the same time give people the ability to instantly liquidate their investment if they choose, I'm pretty sure people can't do that with stocks because it takes longer to sell.Just like with penny stocks their are a lot of scams and that is what the SEC needs to target but not all of them

Does anyone know if you purchase something with Bitcoin in the US 
 Is that a taxable transaction?, Because although you are not selling that asset for fiat, You are still liquidating that asset for  goods or services. If this is true it will never be used as a currency.
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:04:30
It was 100% futures that reked  Bitcoin, Just look at the timeline and you will see that day they started Bitcoin began the downward spiral and this is what also made volume and demand goway down after the crash because it caused the domino effect of panic selling in combination with the fat cats selling to short it.

@_date: 2018-02-17 11:10:37
I think it's going to go much higher this time before any major correction because I don't think we will have an event where millions of people suddenly heard about this and are all buying in a short time frame. There will be sudden price fluctuation but nothing like the 400 bln market cap swing in 2 weeks that we saw.
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:25:38

You need watch Allesio Retani's YouTube channel he is very accurate on with his assessments of Bitcoin, which by the way he called this last increase the day before it happened, and also the housing and stock market bubbles we are currently in,He will make you realize that all markets are artificially inflated not just BTC

It's the Stock market, People are taking profits from crypto to cover losses simialer to what happens to when altcoins go down following Bitcoin. I think the Cartel is reavaluating their next move since they were recently caught by a very brave exchange who stood up to them.

That happened to me also, They are a criminal corporation that use their own policies to sidestep the law. It even says in their own terms that they can freeze your account for any reason and place the money in a interest bearing account.
