The sad thing about professors is that some are on the cutting edge, and others learned whatever they think they needed to learn years ago and just stick to that subject matter.

I wish all of you young whippersnappers would get off my damn lawn and leave me alone with my bitcoin

If we could get American colleges accepting BTC for tuition, especially with Coinbase offering free BTC to college students, and the MIT thing, this would be a great way to get college students, and their parents immediately into bitcoin

Not to promote Overstock.com, but I really feel that if Overstock can come out in the next couple of months and continue to state that they consistently pulling in millions of dollars and their CEO keeps talking about it, then this will be what drive more and more businesses to accept.  Not saying the all of the mom and pops dont need our support as well, however Overstock is big, CEO talks about it, and the news covers it.

Agreed.  The young will embrace digital money as part of their daily life.  Many barely have cash as it is and are used to debit cards, gift cards, Starbucks payment apps, etc...

I buy a lot of amazon and other cards through gyft and use my gyft points for starbucks cards.  Kind of like free coffee

I just ordered a poster from your site.  In the checkout option it lists Coinbase as the option instead of Bitcoin.  Not everyone knows what Coinbase is.  You really need to change it to say Bitcoin with the BTC icon,
