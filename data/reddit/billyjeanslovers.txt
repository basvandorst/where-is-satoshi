really old news.  Wake me when  starts taking bitcoins.  
Their [FAQ]( states "For your peace of mind, ordering via the internet with a credit card is the most secure method of ordering."

Do you have a source for this information?  Seems like if every bitcoin user was hacked it still wouldn't even come close.  Perhaps there are a lot more bitcoin users than I imagine?

1. git clone 
2. cd electrum
3. pyrcc4 icons.qrc -o gui/icons_rc.py
4. python electrum.py
5. file-new/restore  
6. Plug in trezor that has already been setup on mytrezor.com

I find 0 to be impossible.  If the price was 0 then I would own every one of them.  As long as at least one other person on earth feels this way, 0 is impossible.

I keep getting an invalid reference to r.
@_date: 2014-08-12 23:56:30
or you could just buy a trezor

I could be wrong, but on a world scale I believe drug money is dwarfed by government corruption money. Of course a lot of times the two go together.

I would typically start with [google](  In this case within the first three results for "trezor hardware schematics":
* the Trezor [manual](
* the satoshilabs [document tree]( at github.

isn't it half the equation? You need a private key and a master public key? So he has a private key out there, somebody just needs his MPK which armory doesnt encrypt?
I dont actually know anything about this stuff.
edit: actually am I missing something here, from your source, 
"One weakness that may not be immediately obvious, is that knowledge of the extended public key + any non-hardened private key descending from it is equivalent to knowing the extended private key"

You can read the [source]( and build it yourself.

It sure would be ideal for governments though.  
@_date: 2014-08-12 09:19:15
a politician would buy it if the taxpayers were paying.
In fact, they would buy pallets of it. $18 orange juice too.
Oh, Canada.

if trezor is stolen you still need the pin.

Don't know too much about macs, but  does have a section on 'OSX sources installation' which is about as much as I can help.
@_date: 2014-08-16 19:49:03
you're right.
It's pretty great, works well.  Been wanting labels since I got my trezor.

It is not safe to continue using this wallet. [Read this.](

It sure does give fuel to the people who think bitcoin will never be a currency due to volatility.
