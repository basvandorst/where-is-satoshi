Totally aware of this. I wasn't planning to take any measures to recover my coins - was just going to consider them lost..
But a few have identified they were moved almost directly into BTC-e's Hot Wallet. So i've taken my chances and submitted a request to BTC-e in hopes they may do SOMEthing. Its worth a shot I guess, but no high hopes.
The thing is: How do I prove to BTC-e those are my funds? Which, they're actually not mine anymore.
The closest thing I've thought of is.. I did a withdrawal on my own BTC-e account in my own name to one of those wallet addresses that were jacked - and then sent back into BTC-e by the hacker. Maybe they'd take that as "evidence" that those really were my funds.

I had 2fa protected my email. Hacker compromised my computer where my email was open
@_date: 2014-11-20 13:16:39
Thank You. Appreciate the generosity and. You didn't have to do that. I was only speaking to my attacker.. but thanks!
I'm normally not a moron, so thanks for the support there. Although in hindsight there was some moronic overlooking of some pretty obvious things I could have done.
Although, it doesn't help to call names, even if it is myself..
Happy Thursday

I had TeamViewer running. But I can't confirm that's what was used. I think it likely tho.
Thief downloaded my wallet backup out of my gmail (which I leave logged in on the computer)
Thief would also have had to have my pw. it definitely couldn't be brute force attacked. Tho I was stupid and used it other places.
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:16:02
when is your product coming to market?
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:24:28
In fact. Somebody already tipped me $1.50. Here's 200 bits to keeping passing it along! @_date: 2014-11-19 21:22:59
I used 2fa on blockchain.info, but they got thru to my wallet backup file (which can be decrypted with password alone) - which was in my 2fa protected email account.. which they bypassed by (i think) going thru my TeamViewer.. where I used a common password from other sites (stupid of me).  I had also use my blockchain.info wallet password on other sites, but not many and only reputable ones.  I think I may have at some point had a trojan or keylogger.. Hard to say.
@_date: 2014-11-20 13:19:48
it was &lt; $20k, &lt;-- FTFY
BUt your point is still 100% valid
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:38:21
just my other computers - including my work computer
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:59:44
I changed the TeamViewer password and stopped using it for now. It was the same login and pw for TeamViewer I've used many other places, too many in fact.
@_date: 2014-11-27 13:35:26
Be sure you DON'T have Blockchain.info email you backup files, and don't keep them anywhere.. Don't use them! Delete them all ASAP, maybe move your coins to a new wallet and addresses if you've ever used this file. Its existence anywhere, even an old copy, leaves you vulnerable! These backup files are NOT 2FA protected. See how they got me:
I learned this the hard way from my loss of 50 coins... blockchain.info 2fa gave me false security. And the 2fa on my email even more "security" but they worked around both 2FA systems and got my backup file by taking control of my computer where I had my email open, where they downloaded it from my email... and somehow also got my (very good) password that I had reused in a handful of other places. (stupid.) Probably they got into my computer either with a trojan, or by using my TeamViewer.
@_date: 2014-11-27 13:40:39
Indeed, I learned one of those "hit me across the head with a 2x4 lessons" from this. If only I could give this same lesson to others.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:43:17
TeamViewer was connected thru my VPN, so ISP traffic wouldn't help, probably.
Perhaps TeamViewer would have an IP.. but what hacker wouldn't use a VPN/Tor or other untraceable IP? Probably completely fruitless.
I really don't think I want to spend the time dealing with the police.. since I'm pretty clear there's NOTHING they could do to get my money back - it would just be a lot of talking to this-and-that person.. for what?
But I'll consider it further.. i hadn't before, so you got me started considering it.
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:05:49
Teamviewer uses a central server if you have it set-up that way - which I did. All anybodoy had to do was log-in with my email and pw and they would have control of my online computers.  This appears to have happened, and probably the most likely since that same email/pw combination I've used many other places. Tho I need to see if I can find the logs to confirm.
How they got my wallet password is a bit more of a mystery. It is definitely not guessable and could not be brute-forced. Though I did also use that same wallet pw at a handful of very "legitimate" bitcoin sites.
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:57:38
yeah I just looked at it, it looks like its for high profile people. I didn't see myself there - no surprise.
@_date: 2014-11-27 13:29:34
Wallet file was taken from me also - by taking control of my computer and downloading it out of my gmail (which I had open on the computer). Not sure if they got in thru my TeamViewer or a trojan, I'm still investigating.
edit: Here's my loss thread: 
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:27:39
Thanks I've already been doing this. Will continue =)
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:07:44
Right, email backups are encrypted - as was mine - with my very strong password.  I now realize 2fa is impossible on a static file, but it never really crossed my mind much before. If it did, I thought to myself "well, my email is 2fa protected".
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:56:29
Good thought.. but very certainly No. I only used the Chrome app
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:13:45
Here's probably how mine were stolen via TeamViewer:
1. I had an "account" with TV: my email as username, and my password. From here I could control my few computers in the account.
2. Since I had re-used that same username/password for TV on other websites as well (MANY other sites), its conceivable it could have been compromised from one of those sites. Also, I may have been keylogged because I know I had a virus on my computer a while back.
Since there was no additional password for the computer, all they hacker needed was my account login/pass... from there they could have gotten my TV computer ID, and used that going forward.
Anyhow, good luck!
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:28:07
Thanks for the sentiment. I hope you'll consider looking into Bitcoin a bit further. It wasn't my life savings, although it may look like it. I have always followed the advice "never put more into Bitcoin than you can afford to completely lose". And, I didn't. While it doesn't affect my day-to-day-life one ounce, it does hurt, bad, and represents many hours of time lost.  Mistakes teach. I keep going
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:30:57
check the inputs on the 2 tx's. Some are very old. Many haven't been spent since I did some mining and some saving over a year ago. I suppose that could look like a mixer, i never thought of that, but not likely a mixer would be saving coins for a year and then tossing them out.  These 2 Tx's were my wallet (inputs) and now in the hacker's posession.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:39:59
My sentiments too. I never went into Bitcoin thinking there was anyone who had my back.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:58:36
was encrypted via a very good pw.. but I used that same pw on a handful of other sites (all reputable I thought)
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:27:31
Many.. from bitcoin websites to banks.. to shopping websites.. too many to count (my teamviewer pw that is).  Maybe a handful of reputable bitcoin sites actually had my same wallet pw
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:25:49
Here is some free Bitcoin somebody gave me already in this thread. I've had my feet wet for a year. Your turn for 1000 bits @_date: 2014-12-15 18:49:11
My machine running the node was hacked and I lost coins:
I have not yet re-started running my full-node on my new clean OS.
While I don't think running the full-node software left a security "hole" in my machine, per-se. Could it possibly?
I'm wondering if it gives hackers a tip, says "hey check here, its a bitcoin user, use one of your favorite vectors at this IP and you may have some luck finding a good stash of coin."
This is a machine where I use passwords to log into wallets/ sites which may include ones that contain bitcoin, so I can't risk any insecurity, even if that insecurity just may be tipping off hackers to check out my IP and watch it."
I'll need to think this through and do some more research to determine if I feel safe running a node again.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:30:17
I'm going to start looking, but any ideas on the best way to contact BTC-e?
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:20:53
No, not on that list, but that's just the first 400 of the list..
I've heard of DoxBin on the darknet - is that just a site where usernames and pw's are freely displayed? Should I be checking that site for my possibly leaked info? Or is it a place where people have to pay to get the info.?
your last question is correct. I had an "account" with TeamViewer's website and all they needed to do was login with my login/pass and they would have access to that computer...
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:01:16
exactly. We went to bed and left a paused TV episode up on the screen (which is also our TV). I would assume the hacker, upon login, hit exactly the right button (probably just 'spacebar') and unwittingly started the episode playing again.
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:28:52
Now that I learned how a hacker can remote-control your computer, I'm like - a pw manager actually leaves everything in 1 place! If I got a trojan or something, they'd only need to get 1 password from a keylogger, and I'm done!
Tho I think i'm going to start using the PW manager, but maybe leave out my pws that unlock significant funds.
@_date: 2014-11-20 19:05:40
which file?
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:36:59
I actually use it - but not for this wallet account. I thought it too risky to store a password in there that controlled so many coins.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:50:40
I probably can't prove otherwise so you're right in saying it. Since I gave out my wallet addresses in the post I didn't want others tracking me down, including any further hackers.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:41:36
nope, different pws, although both had been use elsewhere. The Teamviewer pw i re-used lots of places. The wallet pw only a few others.
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:26:03
I enjoyed writing and storytelling in a different life - glad I still got some of it.
So much easier when its true.. just remember and type.
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:34:32
That's certainly a possibility. I work in IT but not with those doing who manage PCs. I suppose I could quit using my work computer for personal stuff. tho it sucks trying to use my phone or carry 2 comps. Sucks so much I probably won't stop using my work comp in hindsight. at least I will quit using it for big amounts of BTC
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:08:35
Agreed.. Putting my Thief hat on for a second.... If I stole coins I'd probably put them directly into a coin mixer like:
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:58:48
I never talked about the amount of coin I had online.I'm guessing it has a hunch on a lead and was followed.. My speculation is that perhaps I entered my credentials on a non-secure connection at some point. OR maybe on my compromised machine w/ a trojan - which I know it had a while back OR maybe one site I signed up at was leaking my credentials.. hard to say. I do think he was able to use my computer through TeamViewer - and my pw for that I had used MANY places. SHIT it sucks talking about the stupidity of me
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:10:08
I would think a crafty hacker who got ahold of credentials, would try them any place he/she could. Teamviewer woulid be a gold mine, cuz if you get in, you  potentially have direct access to remote control, file transfer, etc. a victim's computer. So if I get some people logging into my fake site called makemoreBTC.com, i capture their creds, and try them in a handful of places where I could maybe steal bitcoins - like TeamViewer, blockchain, coinbase, any exchange, etc.
edit: All this sleuthing is making me think like a thief. May I use these insights for good!
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:30:56
yeah.. for once I'm hoping it stays low for the next year so I can replenish! :-\
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:09:28
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:46:16
haven't tried yet. I will fire-up teamviewer and see if I can find logs or something
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:52:26

@_date: 2014-11-20 04:18:53
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:14:25
Mine did- but I left it logged in! on a computer that was apparently compromised - they literally just took control of my computer and searched my emails and downloaded my backup file
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:59:40
Nice! way to take action.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:39:38
could be the backend of an exchhange or coin mixer?
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:11:44
Great question. PLEASE learn from my mistake!
They got ahold of the backup file.. which does NOT require 2fa to decrypt! They literally downloaded it out of my gmail (where I was having Blockchain.info automatically send a backup. The file is the familiar "wallet.aes.json" file.
DO NOT leave this file anywhere. I'd suggest not even using it, or taking it securely offline ASAP if you do use it.
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:53:18
@_date: 2014-11-20 13:07:56
email did have 2fa. they actually compromised my computer, where my email account was open :-\
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:38:03
got into gmail (by taking remote control of computer where it was logged in - compromised/shared TeamViewer password likely to blame)
got wallet backup (see above)
password us is ~~weak~~/shared/~~written down somewhere in gmail~~ or previous leak
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:34:34
Surprisingly my coinbase balances, and my wife's, were all safe. I think as much crap as coinbase gets for being a "centralized service", they are actually doing some things right.
Here's the shitty part: I had been transferring coins OUT of coinbase to blockchain.info because I saw this as a more secure option.  instead, it turns out Coinbase actually has some pretty decent protections and limits in place.. not many stories of people losing large amounts of coins there.
Although, if you are against centralized exchanges, or don't like how they occasionally freeze people's funds for suspicion of illicit activity, you'll be against them out-of-the-gate.
My recommendation is that Coinbase (and probably Circle) are a safe and decent option for beginners and probably intermediates.. They are doing a lot of things right.
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:12:52
they are encrypted. BUT I hadn't really realized that they are not 2fa protected, even though 2fa was set-up and working on my blockchain account. So, my single password must have been used to unlock it.. I'm unclear as to how that password was acquired by the hacker. It wasn't guessable nor brute-forceable. Although I had used it also on other sites so my guesses are (1) I entered it carelessly over an insecure connection (2) I entered it on a site that wasn't legit, or that leaked my info or (3) i was keylogged somehow
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:53:05
yes with a good entropy pw, that I may have used on other sites :-\
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:33:57
yes. Crazy part is I literally saw them moving the mouse and looking for other bitcoin sites in my email (which I leave open on that computer). By the time I got there, I saw in Chrome the backup file was just downloaded
@_date: 2014-11-20 13:11:19
Can't blame you for saying it. I was thinking there's little way I could prove I didn't just make this up. In the interest of transparency, I've got 3.93259 mBTC or $1.41 in my changetip account since this post. And, some generous redditors have tossed a total of 0.10528301 BTC to my address above. I AM only asking for the hacker to return funds. I'm not asking for tips from others.. Although, I suppose I can't prove it, so you just gotta take my word for it.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:32:50
it is and I had a great password on it. unfortunately I had used the pw in other places, and further, perhaps they keylogged me
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:13:44
I'm sorry you think that
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:20:42
you speak accurately. And, my hindsight is something like 10/20 now after all this.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:14:03
I appreciate the empathy. It does require some time to recover form. And, its not a light experience. The visceral feeling of "being violated" is real.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:19:10
You could say this is my last ditch effort to appeal to the human side of the hacker.. I wanted to use a throwaway because I gave out ~~several~~ all of my wallet addresses in the post, and really don't want people (more hackers?) tracking my identity somehow perhaps from exchanges I've used and whatnot.
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:59:56
No. What would they do?
btw the person was using my computer remotely - not inside my house.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:45:42
Likely TeamViewer. Or, a trojan. Tho I was using virus protection which appeared in-tact.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:03:46
Nope - didn't do that one
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:35:58
Thanks.. its a start :-\
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:57:32
Yep that's the long and short of it. Hard lessons.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:29:11
Score. Any idea if BTC-e would offer help?
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:15:20
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:24:21
Probabaly it was just TeamViewer that they compromised. The login was the same username &amp; pw I had used on other sites. so shame on me.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:21:38
Hey man (or woman). It does suck, but take it from the person whose stomach hurts more than yours... Get some Bitcoin. While we're working out these kinks in the early days, Bitcoin is a sign of where the future of humanity is going. We'll get better at it. But, jump in and see, even for just 0.1 BTC. Get your feet wet. This experience hasn't turned me off to Bitcoin. I'm coming back stronger and pushing forward.
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:23:37
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:47:27
nice strategy. And Kudos sticking to it. It does take discipline - so many moving pieces.. but important since its MONEY we're talking about
@_date: 2014-11-27 13:24:46
Me. Just last week. :-\
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:15:25
wow. Good find. Do you think its worth me contacting BTC-e and seeing if they would help?
edit: I put info in OP - perhaps someone will come forward to help.
@_date: 2014-11-20 19:32:42
Thank You. [My 50 BTC loss]( was not all in vain.. You made a helpful change. Hopefully we'll save future users from a similar fate.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:25:24
well. I was "meaning to" set up some cold storage soon.  Figured I was "safe for now" with 2fa.  Much like I would guess many of us "mean to" change our passwords so we aren't re-using our same password on coinbase + email, but many don't get to it.. yet: "maybe next month"
Well, procrastination and lack or proactivity ate me
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:27:05
I checked their site and didn't see anything immediately. I will check when I boot up that OS again. Right now I'm taking a few days with that HDD off whilst I rebuild...
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:20:17
Teamviewer ID was my email address. which I used in other sites in combination with the same password. Yup, dumb. just never thought of it
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:15:20
Wow nice work.
I'm already building up my fortress that, not surprisingly, consists mostly of offline paper wallets - and knowing when to use secure machines and when not to.
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:26:34
I've got an old android I could use for that, never did. DUM
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:38:51
Actually I was this stupid. Hard to believe, yes.  I was apparently the right combination of techie, yet lazy, decent investor, yet procrastinator. I did know exactly how NOT to have this happen. Problem is I never implemented.. kind of like how I procrastinated thru school. Tho I did graduate ;)
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:43:57
looks like he was, people in this thread have identified the destination is BTC-e's hot wallet
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:29:08
GREAT. Glad I may have prevented a loss for you!  I've been generating many paper wallets offline on a clean system lately so I don't get burned again. I recommend NOT keeping large amounts of coin at blockchain.info. Their wallet is "secure" but there are so many ways around it.. :-\
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:03:19


Anybody used this - how much time will they take (waste) of mine. Do you think its worth it?
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:35:07
was running v9, but I will check, probably much of this still applies
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:42:11
Hahahaha nice.
@_date: 2014-11-20 04:21:19
nope. different pws, both difficult to guess. Although the email wasn't compromised - the hacker got into my email by getting on my computer where my email was left open.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:34:59
Yes 2fa on my gmail. Although I leave it logged in on my home computer, which they were able to take remote control of, and download the file..
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:44:07
Any idea how we would find which exchange it went to?  I'm thinking only if they found this reddit post
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:46:49
What I'm finding is there may have been a few sessions NOT from me, but from somebody with no name. Also, The details logs contain barely a day of data.. they currently start after the hacker was out, so I missed it.. going to see if my online account offers anything more useful.
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:17:47
Most definitly. I told my wife almost the exact same thing last night. i said something like


And - I was hoping to *maybe* reach the human side of this hacker withoutright honesty. This was a last ditch effort to get my coins back... though I am not really expecting it.  The 2nd purpose of this post, hpefully is to become a shining example of what not to do = horrible warning.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:22:55
At the risk of giving away too much of my personal history. I'll just say "Yes, very much so"
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:35:59
thanks, it does suck, every bit helps. Tho I hope you're ok if I tip it forward. since it wont' come close to making up what I lost, I've been giving my tips here on this throwaway account back to newbies that pop up here
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:05:58
nope, never any of that
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:34:19
To balance out Consumers consuming, we ought be promoting the opposite, converting earned money into BTC. One such service is: 
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:24:46
it did give that pop-up, my wife saw it and said "that thing was up like when you were using your computer from work".. Now I thought maybe I had left it up from earlier in the day, but just to be sure, I'd check.. sure enough... haxxed
@_date: 2015-10-19 18:38:55
I had an attacker steal coins and their method was using TeamViewer. They took control of my computer in the middle of the night and browsed my (logged in) gmail and downloaded a wallet backup for my blockchain.info wallet.
They proceed to empty my wallet.
Story here: 
My explanations for how they got my TeamViewer passwords are:
* I did have a pretty weak password on the machine itself or no password, I can't actually remember which.
* My teamviewer.com "account" also granted access to my machine. And I had my gmail and a password for it that I had used on several other sites. Perhaps the attacker was using a purchased list of usernames/passwords that had been compromised from other sites, and stumbled upon mine and it worked to get the attacker into my teamviewer.com account.
* perhaps TeamViewer has some security hole which is yet undiscovered.. and there are 1 or more attackers out there who know about it.
* I was running a Bitcoin Full-node at the time so perhaps that is how they got the idea to attempt an attack at my IP.
My next steps:
* stopped using teamviewer
* started using actual cold storage (FINALLY)
* Started using a password manager and use different passwords in all sites - so if a single site is compromised, those leaked credentials won't get any attackers into any other of my websites.
The happy news for me:
With the help of redditors, we were able to see that they attackers sent the coins directly to BTC-e. I contacted BTC-e and they believed me, which was awesome. And, they were able to identify the account of the attacker using the deposit addresses. (The attacker moved my coins directly into their BTC-e deposit address - kinda stupid IMO but I'm thankful). BTC-e froze the account of the attacker. I was able to negotiate w/ BTC-e and the attacker for 70% of my coins back.  WHEW. it could have been MUCH worse.  Lucky I was.
