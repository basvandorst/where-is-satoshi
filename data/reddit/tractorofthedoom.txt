Hey its me ur brother
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:22:59
yeah dude i know, i just didn't take that into consideration
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:11:04
So we going to the moon or not?
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:18:42
So I was just thinking about this... What if BTC hits the moon one day, and then nobody wants to buy any because it's too expensive? What then?
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:52:33
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:22:43
OH SHIT
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:18:12
Hey its me ur good cause
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:24:11
Also, sorry for asking such dumb and noobie questions, but what's the quickest and most effective way to sell btc?
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:02:18
If Fifty can hold, so can you.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:32:40
if this shit is real, i will smell my sock
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:32:50
Okay. Should I still use the dollar cost averaging method if I've lost 'faith' in it? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:14:46
we'll talk in a year
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:08:42
then what?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:32:17
does it even matter in the long run?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:27:41
Where can I find proper advice?
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:51:26
I wish i could help but idk what that partially encrypted key is
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:00:05
bro i wanna go each day
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:52:12
Boss... Ia uite oleaca, 12 k. Sa mai bag?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:23:22
so if i live in romania and buy BTC from USA through localbitcoins, is there any issue? why would i buy locally?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:35:11
will it ever be great again?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:24:36
how do i rescue programs
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:12:50
i see all kinds of different cryptocurrencies. are any of those worth it, or is bitcoin king?
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:40:03
You know you're on the bitcoin subreddit when a guy needs to add /s to this comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:27:54
so with all this shit going down now, am i fucked in the ass?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:21:16
the bitcoin stayed in the program
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:43:06
I use Electrum as a wallet. frate, zi si mie ca nu inteleg. de ce is taxe mai mari daca esti in romania?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:16:21
You think this is a big deal? You on some rookie shit, man.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:41:01
thanks man
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:59:23
would you risk it?
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:57:28
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:23:37
what is futures?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:42:28
what do these 2 words mean
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:07:23
but... but... muh early adopting... 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:00:20
What isn't?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:42:32
Buy when?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:32:27
buy now or not?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:43:40
If my intent is to sell asap (yes, i know), when should i buy?
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:18:31
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:44:39
We'll talk in a year, man.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:32:20
bro. it doesn't matter
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:13:21
so if it increases in the next 3 days, do i buy? what if i do 20 bucks right now?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:00:51
what? so it won't be like 50k in 2018?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:32:49
so you mean invest half 2day and half on monday?
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:14:24
This is history. We're all taking part in a historical event. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:53:25
Well keep holding bro
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:35:21
Well, to me Romania is complete, utter shite. I'm just wondering how a fellow citizen can enjoy living here.
Putem vorbi in romana daca vrei.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:45:25
Plm, eu am 19 ani, deci nu prea am ce sfat sa iti dau. Doar atat- incearca sa traiesti singur o luna (sa te intretii, sa muncesti) si ai sa vezi ce de cacat e.
Am fost in Australia acum ceva timp si pot sa iti spun ca standardul nostru de trai e foarte scazut. Noi suntem multumiti daca avem bani de chirie si de mancare..
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:25:41
so I better invest on sunday?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:45:26
Everyone except you
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:42:38
Is the dollar cost averaging method still viable?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:32:51
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:48:31
how to? i got some too on my old drive, but i deleted them in 2013 or smth
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:48:05
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:14:47
so what do you think about bitcoin ATMs? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:30:24
i don't have any emails, it was called ru bitcoin miner or smth
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:34:45
Bro i'm in for the long run, I want to see this baby shine
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:55:49
hodl... for how long?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:50:10
futures contract
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:34:33
Fuck this game. Ima keep holding till I hear on the news that BTC has reached 1 mil. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:15:33
should i invest now or after futures shit? i'm in for the long run either way
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:54:03
each month?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:28:20
haven't slept in 3 nights, i'll either get motherfucking rich or stay poor.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:29:28
I'm getting kinda addicted to this shit, to the point where it fucks up my quality of life.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:41:13
Yeah, I'm waiting for a day like this too
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:17:57
Good question.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:09:58

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:08:01

@_date: 2017-12-08 15:14:38
correction means huge dip, right?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:22:22
how much do you think i should invest
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:40:56
for real now, how many chances can you get at becoming a gazillionaire? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:26:12
Buy back and hold
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:23:01
Gonna have to cum in my mouth now
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:14:21
so what will happen once the futures shit begins?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:06
for real, when will the dip happen?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:40:51
man, thank you. but i want to know - if i mined that bitcoin and did NOT transfer it from my program to any wallet, what happens to it?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:32:45
Gimme some btc bro
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:42:39
In the sewers. I will be hugging my hard disk in order to fall asleep in the muddy, shite-filled water. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:54:10

@_date: 2017-12-08 15:30:29

@_date: 2017-12-14 20:01:21
You too, man. You too. One hell of a ride though, we'll remember this shit when we're old..
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:32:11

@_date: 2017-12-14 19:33:18

@_date: 2017-12-09 16:24:34

@_date: 2017-12-05 19:21:23
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:38:34
Good job, man. Never give up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:51:35
Esti roman?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:55:40

@_date: 2017-12-25 13:18:45
isn't romania supposed to be shite?
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:45:05
ok but for real real now. will i ever get a similar chance? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:49:45
None of these fuckers is a veteran. Neither am I. The real veterans are HODLing right now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:21:01
If I sell my apartment and spend it on BTC, there is a slight chance I'll get extremely rich. Right? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:53:17
you got lucky, bro. enjoy :)
also send some over to your brother from romania lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:29:59
With payal its 20%
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:19:34
Haha, eu am un pic mai mult. Poate in 2 ani scoatem si noi de o dacia duster.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:13:52
Yes, I'm new. So what else do you recommend?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:08:56
how do i transfer my btc from my electrum wallet to USD?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:43:20
how do i convert it to usd?
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:17:53
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:15:07
Idk lol but its full of bad news now
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:53:51
bro it's better fees than with paypal
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:43:30
Like the old days, brother. Forever a hodler.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:53:50
Keep it but send some to your brother too
@_date: 2019-02-09 08:56:46
So do you think we'll hit the moon this time? I got some money I want to invest, but idk.
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:51:08
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:15:02
They all sound like socialists to me. I get it, the biggest mafia out there is the bank. But still, talking about bitcoin like it's a means to destabilize the economy and turn peace into riot makes no sense at all. It's a wonderful technology with huge potential, is all.
@_date: 2019-04-09 13:28:24
Got it. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:04:36
I've got to admit it... For a while it felt like everything was going to hell. Now the hype's back!
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:41:46
brb going to hang myself
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:47:32
Yooo so if I sell my btc immediately and then buy more for the same ammount of money I've sold it with, do I end up with more btc or not?
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:35:00
We do lots of cocaine
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:21:32
to the moon again!
@_date: 2018-04-30 12:23:57
In Romania too
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:49:35
How to be more safe? Do I have to stay offline?
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:57:17
How to
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:05:59
How safe is the electrum wallet nowadays?
