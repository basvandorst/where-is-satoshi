I've thought of this very scenario, but humor me. So you spend 743 bucks on coinbase transferring your USD to say, ethereum. Send it to binance. Now your 743 ETH is only worth 700 on binance. So you buy 700 bucks worth of BTC. Send that back to Coinbase where it will be worth 743 bucks worth of BTC. Except now you've paid 2 transfer fees.
I can see how this would work if you've got some profit on binance off of something like iota, or from something else you want to liquidate, but even then selling back to ETH would be alot faster and cheaper. But for some people who might be trying to beat the system, it seems like alot of hassle that may end up the same anyways. 
Regardless, if I want to cash anything out, it's gotta go back to Coinbase anyways for me to move it back to USD. So I suppose it'll workout that way in the end.

And if he paid 150 bucks in "05" for nearly half a bitcoin, he majorly overpaid hahaha.

Coinbase app. easiest way to get started. Download and follow instructions. Then revert to the search bar with any questions.

Yes each one works with the same ledger nano s. Yeah, it's going to be different software for each. But BTC, LTC, and ETH are chrome browser add-ons, while ripple is an app you download. You can download to multiple computers and still access it though. 
So yeah, you won't be able to see all of your holdings together one one screen, but it's not too much of a hassle to switch between apps. Plus. If you have any substantial amount, this is the safest way to store it. And I'll take safety over convenience any day. I've kept alot of the exchanges before only to be annoyed when the crash.
