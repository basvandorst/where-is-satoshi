Preppers don't even trust "paper" gold, never mind cryptocurrency. If they can't hold it in their hands, they don't buy it.
Or put another way - "this might be a pump-and-dump if..."

Many of us like Bitcoin *because* its very *existence* "picks a fight with Big Brother".
This entire situation makes a good example of why we **need** BTC - When the government won't honor the constitutional restrictions we've placed on it, we need ways to fight back.  And I don't know about *you*, but I would prefer to have at least a *few* options available before it comes down to exercising the real purpose of the second amendment.

In order to put metals in an IRA, you need to select an IRA custodian (an actual company like a bank, not your "Uncle Al, wink wink nudge nudge", that will hold your silver for you.  Then, when you buy, it gets shipped directly to that custodian.
Although a horrendously complex loophole exists to get around that requirement, as the IRS intends it to work, you never actually get to touch your shiny.  You buy it, it goes straight to the custodian.  You might as well have bought SLV, for all it matters.

Since you can only put $5500 into an IRA per year, yes, I suppose you could *easily*  do that - Though for our "hypothetical" tax dodger, you might have over-complicated converting BTC into tax-free money (since you will *eventually* need to pay taxes on a traditional IRA)...
You could just cash out your BTC, pretty much untraceably (yeah yeah, we all know they *can* trace it - They just can't connect it to "you") tax-free, via a variety of methods.  Then you could invest that money into a *Roth* IRA, and you'd even get to enjoy *legally* tax-free *gains* on your (not quite legally) tax-free BTC income.
Or you could just spend your BTC on shinies that you can actually enjoy today, tax-free (if hypothetically so inclined, of course).

The IRA wants you to belong to the "right" religion, for the good of your soul.
The IRS robs you at gunpoint.
**You** decide which is which.
