[bitcointicker.co]( dev here.... :-)
So the reason for this as mentions is that it looks like your computers time synced at some point whilst it was receiving trades.   
The bitstamp [websocket]( api is the source of new trades and this does not include the timestamp of the trade, only the following data:
    Streams JSON dictionary:
     id - trade unique ID
     amount - trade amount
     price - trade price 
So the trade timestamp comes from your local client. If this changes at some point, and it happens to go back in time.... :-) Then it's feasible you would see the strangeness you have reported. 
Whilst I'm here, many thanks to you and the other members of the community who continue to use the site.  Cheers!

Thank you and thanks for the tip! :-)
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:16:53
Perhaps :-) It does give you a nice view of the depth though. Also some may prefer to see the depths listed side by side, rather than vertically. I'd be very welcome however to hear how you think it can be improved, or perhaps, what in particular you like about bitcoinwisdom. Which I agree is a fantastic site, the design and coding is obviously top notch.
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:42:40
Previously the depth data has not been stored in real time, it is collected and published immediately to connected users. This stores the data and allows you to replay it......
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:40:33
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:12:38
Yep, I noticed that as well. After a while the cpu usage would skyrocket and start to slow everything down. 
Fingers crossed the fix I put in place last week should stop all that and it should tick along without using much cpu. If you go to options and disable the animate depth movements that should also help with cpu usage. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:32:56
I've fixed this, it should be easier now to click on a link.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:39:08


Hey there, I've only just seen this post. Really glad that you like the telnet ticker :-)
This week I released an update which should hopefully fix the issues you were having with chrome. I noticed the cpu usage of the code had increased over time. It should be much better now. I'd be interested to know if you find it less buggy. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:39:07
I don't yet appear to be receiving trade/depth updates through via their API (
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:00:31
There is no way to choose at the moment, I can certainly look into this for you though. 
Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:45:16
Yes, didn't notice that at first :-)
The api is working though, ticker is up:

WHAT’S NEW?
Our team has been working day and night to rebuild and restore security to the Bitstamp site so customers can resume transacting with us quickly, safely, and confidently. Bitstamp is now fully operational with a number of key improvements:
MULTI-SIG * With the integration of BitGo multi-sig technology, Bitstamp is now the first and only major bitcoin exchange to incorporate the industry's best security practices available today. 
COMPLETELY NEW HARDWARE INFRASTRUCTURE * The Bitstamp systems are running on 100% new hardware deployed from a completely secure backup of our code and data. 
AMAZON WEB SERVICES * Bitstamp is now running on Amazon’s world-class AWS cloud infrastructure, architected to be one of the most secure and reliable cloud computing environments available.
COMMISSION-FREE TRADING * As a note of thanks to our loyal customers, all transactions conducted on Bitstamp through the end of the North American Bitcoin Conference -- January 17th (at 11:59pm UTC) -- will be commission-free. 
We appreciate your patience and understanding during this disruption of services. Since 2011, we’ve worked hard to be one of the largest and most trusted bitcoin exchanges in the world. While this is a time of challenge for our company, we expect to emerge from this experience having set an even higher bar than before for trust and confidence in our services. 
On a personal note, I’d like to thank the incredible teams at Bitstamp and at our lead investor Pantera Capital who have worked around-the-clock from multiple time zones in the last few days. I’m incredibly proud of the herculean work of this extended team, and grateful to the phenomenal show of support from customers, friends, and partners in the bitcoin community. 
We look forward to serving you!
For additional information, please refer to our customer FAQ or contact our support team at support
Thank you,

Thanks, glad you like it. I still need to update the code for the main page. The code for the prototype is much cleaner, so it is easier to modify. Second time round..... you learn a few things :-)
Hopefully won't take too long. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 18:03:56
Thanks mate :-)
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:14:44
Interesting, thanks! :-) 
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:20:23
[This]( looks amazing! 
Perhaps I could add a simple graph and a means to switch between exchanges.... ah the possibilities :-)
@_date: 2016-01-13 18:02:04
Hi there, this just links up to the same stream of data which powers bitcointicker.co. It's just subscribed to various redis channels, once it receives some data it pushes it to all connected clients. The data is initially sourced from the various api's provided by the exchanges, and published to redis.
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:14:26
This tracks the stats from a relay node, such as connected nodes, mempool size, transactions per second and it also lists the top 15 highest priority transactions.
It allows you to view the health of the bitcoin network with a quick glance at the stats/graphs.
Would love to hear any comments or suggestions!
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:06:35
Hey there :) At the moment I record the real time trading history for bitstamp. I'm only keeping the last 2 hours at the moment.  
This can be viewed here :   
I've not added any other exchanges or updated the chart as, to be honest, I didn't really think anyone was using the feature. I've only just started to use it myself as a way of re-running what has just happened in the market and then making a video of it. I could add the other exchanges at some point. I'll take a look at doing this. Cheers!
@_date: 2015-07-18 07:48:27
blockchain.info reports its own node as coordinates of 0,0. Which happens to be there :-) 
I should really move them off to its own box.

0.11.0 node here..... :-)  
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:09:04
You're right, there should be music.... :)
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:54:15
Having trouble keeping up here... :)  
@_date: 2015-10-24 08:37:23
Some relay node stats [here]( for anyone interested. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 23:29:51
It is annoying I agree.... :-) unfortunately the open source library, speak.js, does not come with a choice of voices. That's all there is. So you're stuck with the wargames voice. 
I'm glad you use the site though, and don't worry I won't be putting this on the main page :-)  
Coinbase is available [here]( and I need to get around to adding Gemini. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 17:28:27
 - I'm the author, and unfortunately it hasn't really changed much at all in 12 months! :-)
I have added a relay node stats page though, and a separate way to view the markets in the prototype section.....
@_date: 2016-05-25 18:33:14
Awesome, looks great!
I've got a similar page going here:
As usual the UI could do with a bit of work. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:31:27
Yep, as Bpsycho said above, they should be optional. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 21:52:11
I'd be interested if anyone can suggest what else could be added to the page to make it more useful. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:01:29
Thanks :-)
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:22:58
Thanks for checking the site out. I will look into getting it to scale correctly for smaller screen resolutions. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:07:57
Gracias !
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:38:09
Thank you! :-)
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:30:50
Agreed, this is needed. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:42:24
Should be working again now.....
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:21:51
bitcointicker.co is my site :-) 
Still under development ....... :-)
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:29:07
If you have a larger screen it will not do this...... but yes, it needs fixing. Perhaps with some jquery magic I can make it moveable. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 19:54:45
Just installed all three at the weekend and got some simple code configured on the server and client. I've been working with socketio from the client side for a short while, but decided I would try and get a server working for myself. Very simple to setup and use. npm for nodejs makes installing the modules super easy :) Redis just works, I'm only using it for publishing and subscribing to messages, but it makes passing info between processes very straight forward.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:42:51
Sorted now, apologies!
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:29:22
Thanks! :-)
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:32:18
The IP is the node (computer running the bitcoind daemon) which reported the transaction to blockchain.info. It's not necessarily the IP of the original node which made the transaction.   
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:28:05
wow, thank you for this. My first tip! :-) Much appreciated!
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:35:17
Cheers mate :-)
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:30:09
Gald you like it ! Yes, it definitely needs this. It will be done! :-)
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:28:09
Thank you! I will keep this in mind :-)
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:35:56
Yes, I agree, for sure it could look much better. I'm still developing it at the moment, once the functionality is better I'll concentrate on getting it to look nice :) Thanks for checking the site out and thanks for the comment!
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:35:30
Thank you!!!
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:21:39
Great ideas, thanks! Glad you like the page. 
Yes, I think moving the blockchain.info bubble is needed, it's causing confusion :-)
Getting this data for the history of the blockchain would mean querying against blockchain's api for every transaction. It might take quite a while.... :-) At the moment I'm not collecting this data, just streaming it. It's certainly something I will look into and would be interesting to look at. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:56:09
hehe..... :-) That is where 127.0.0.1 resolve's to using the db I'm using to resolve the geo location of the IP addresses. I believe this is how blockchain.info reports transactions which were made on its own servers. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:57:50
All good points. 
The volume pie chart is possible for mtgox as their api tells you whether a trade was a result of the execution of a bid or an ask. In theory, it would be possible to work this out for other exchanges if you could keep track of the current bid/ask values and then match this up with the transactions. But I would need to poll much more frequently for it to be accurate. 
Having an option to convert the CNY value to USD sounds like a good feature. 
Volume filtering is also a great idea, one which I think other sites have. Thank you for the recommendations, I'll try to add them to the site in the future!
