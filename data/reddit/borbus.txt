Once a year! So you'll have to predict how much you're going to spend in a year, tie up those funds for a whole year, and not get paid in a year? Or does LN support your transaction going negative?
I suppose one could consider the bit they put into LN "cash" and the bit left in their wallet a long term investment (like a locked in savings account), but it doesn't seem to solve the problem of needing the entire year's funds up front. How do people get paid?

Even a year ago news like this would've actually been exciting. Back in the day we would all think that having a big platform like paypal or Amazon accepting Bitcoin would be all it would take for Bitcoin to go to the moon.
Nowadays it's just ridiculous. The blockchain is full as it is and that's with everyone mostly leaving the Bitcoins on exchanges rather than actually moving them around. Extra traffic due to people spending them on ebay? No chance.

Yeah. Most in this sub are bricking it because they know the price could bomb at any moment and they won't be able to get their BTC to an exchange quickly enough to sell it. Or maybe they're already holding it on an exchange and then the fear is the exchange goes down.
Even with a $30 fee, your transaction could still take hours to get one confirmation:  Note that many are paying *way* more than that in fees to make sure their transaction gets in the next block or two. You have to have pretty substantial holdings to not care about a $100 fee.

It would be better if that happened sometimes in open source. There are countless examples of where the fork becomes the real project and it's kind of confusing when it has a different name. Fact is Bitcoin was going in a direction some people didn't like (small blocks, segwit). Why do you think certain people have the privilege of taking the name in some direction but other people don't? None of them are Satoshi.

Bitcoin Cash still has low fees. I was talking about crypto in general when he said about banding together.

Trustless electronic cash has huge value. But Bitcoin is not that any more and the core developers and their devout followers have no interest in making it that. LN is not that either. It's not trustless and won't work. This is my own opinion as someone trained in computer science and security. Bitcoin now has no value to me and not much value to society. It's just another way for rich people to store and move value around.

It's not that much, but enough to kick start my portfolio. I bought a small amount of btc back in the day just to play with the technology. It turned into something of significant value just by pure luck. I actually wanted to hold until I could spend it on things like normal money.

It's a shame that people have been so misinformed about bitcoin.  I'm starting to lose hope for it, to be honest.  Bitcoin was designed to be a currency which allows quick, easy transactions without having to trust a third party (ie. a bank).  It was not designed to circumvent government regulation.
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:41:59
Exactly.  I would run a full node but the storage and bandwidth requirements got too high.  I bet a lot of people use light clients now.  I would prefer to run a node without having the whole blockchain on disk (as described by Satoshi), but I don't think any clients do this yet.

Yes, if you define dollars as the broad money supply.  My point was that quite a lot of people you speak to think dollars are created by the federal bank or whatever, which is wrong, only some are (a small amount).  When the bank refuses to let you withdraw your money you can't possibly still think that bank money is the same as the money issued by the government (paper notes).

"Digital" is a buzzword that just won't go away.  The reason that I don't like it is that ALL major world currencies are digital.  Being digital is NOT what makes bitcoin different at all.
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:50:43
Not really.  Private banks have a lot more control over the money supply than central banks do and they are generally more corrupt.
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:46:01
This is due to a couple of things.  First, most people have no idea how money works.  They completely take it for granted but have never thought about a) what makes something money and b) who controls the money that we use.
The second problem is they don't want to know.  Most people do not like learning, unless they think that it will make them money.  Most people just have no interest in trying to make money in "unconventional" ways, others have decided that bitcoin is not a good way to make money.
The number of people who are actually serious about taking the control of money away from banks and governments is very tiny and insignificant.  The rest don't give two fucks.
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:30:47
Ok, whatever, you're correcting me on whether it should be capitalised or not.  I prefer to capitalise it because it makes it look like a defined term.  I also prefer the Free Software definition: 
My point was that it doesn't actually have to be Open Source (open source) to be acceptable to use for secure purposes as long as the program is perfect and never needs patches that is.

Yeah but bitcoin was meant to change the world.  It has the potential to make people think about money and consider whether they actually trust the banks to be running their currency (most people aren't even aware they trust the banks to do this).  It's not about roping in morons who are scared by long words.  I guess you can dream too big.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:36:29
90% of the US dollars in the economy were created by private banks, not the US government.  Central banks don't have much of a control over currencies any more.  Bitcoin most certainly is designed to take control of the money supply back from private banks.  Control of the money supply has nothing to do with government regulation, though.
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:04:46
It doesn't matter which cryptocoin succeeds.  Dogecoin is Bitcoin, it's just a different blockchain.  There is no "us and them".

@_date: 2014-03-09 22:30:49
I suppose.  It's a bit strange though since it says that the coin itself isn't actually the bitcoin.  It would have been way cooler if it said "the internet".
@_date: 2014-01-08 11:25:34
We should come up with an agreed way to explain bitcoin to people.  I think the best way is to keep it simple but put emphasis on the fact that it's a currency which solves a difficult problem.  I like to say that it has all the advantages of gold with all the convenience of a digital currency.  With gold you only have to trust the laws of physics; gold can't be copied or printed, but it's inconvenient.  Digital currencies that most people use like USD and GBP are convenient, but it requires everyone to trust the banks; this money can be created or destroyed whenever they decide to.  Bitcoin is as convenient as a digitial currency, but requires no trust in a central authority, instead it is run by us, the users.

Near the beginning of the format war there was the news that Sony would ban pornography on blu-ray.  This is what led all the porn to go to HD DVD to begin with.  Sony later denied this (or realised their stupidity) and porn was available on blu-ray too.  If there had ever been any doubts about porn being available on blu-ray, HD DVD would have quite rightly won the war.

There is a (rather trivial) algorithm for converting exchange rates, but adding a new currency is just running the same algorithm with different parameters.  It doesn't need a new algorithm to deal with bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-02-12 12:47:18


Yeah it really depends how you define currency.  The definition that most people think of is the money issued by a central bank/government.  This is called the base money supply.  But really the currency that most people use is the broad money supply which is largely created by banks.  As far as I'm concerned, the broad money supply is a currency operated by the private banks and a little bit by the central banks.  I don't know if Paypal does contribute to the money supply (ie. do they give out loans?).  If they do then I would say that they too run currencies.
It's interesting because it really makes you think about what money and currency actually is.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:12:21
The older money here knows that the tech is useful when people can actually use it. You can't use BTC. Not unless you want to pay ridiculous fees. The "newly invested money" is just fiat exchanged for BTC in an exchange. Most of the BTC is just fucking sitting there in the exchange. It won't be long at all until the idiots are bored and you can't make money from them and everyone realises there's no value to this thing at all. Luckily BCH is usable, though. There's real value in a currency that is usable.

Oh fuck off. Do you really want to use a coin that "won" because you think it broke the reddit rules? Get a fucking grip. I know you feel like someone is attacking you. The solution is to lose your religious devotion to BTC and see the bigger picture: we are making cryptocurrency happen because we no longer want to use centralised bank money. That is the important thing here, not your supposed "bitcoin wealth".
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:33:15
That's true but you can get that by running a full client that doesn't listen and doesn't serve historic blocks (so new nodes can't sync from it). Running a full node if you can is just a good thing to do.

Because although there are many people willing to buy 1 BTC for 7500 USD, not many people are willing to buy it with a Porsche, so you have to pay whatever they ask, or not. In many places in the world it could be  "cheaper" to exchange currency and then buy, but it's so much effort that many people choose not to. This is a sign that bitcoin isn't as well trusted as USD, yet.
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:38:56
Do you have any idea how long syncing a new node takes? It's already ridiculous to think that users will run full nodes. I love the idea of Bitcoin as much as you do. I've been in it since 2013 and have actually used it to buy things. But loving the idea and refusing to question whether the current system is really going to do what you hope is stupid.

Well if you think the point is to be able to actually spend the coins like cash including sending tips to random people over the Internet then I don't think this analogy holds at all.

You can't. BTC is heavily congested and you have to pay a lot to make successful transactions. Hopefully it changes one day. For BTC that means higher levels (Lightning Network, for example). The price to trade on the blockchain will never decrease, though (it will probably increase).

It depends on the market. Your btc is worth $7k because enough people will buy it for that price and there are not too many other sellers to satisfy that demand. If at some point everyone is selling, you will have to reduce your asking price lots if you want someone to buy *your* coins.

But that on chain transaction fee isn't going go away. Eventually you have to settle on chain and someone has to pay for that. And what happens if you end up need to pay more than you expected over the month? You have to open another channel and pay again.
For LN to work, BTC must be usable *today*.

It doesn't have to be better than the current system with respect to fees because it makes up for that by being a trustless system. But it should be close. I can transfer this much between bank accounts in the UK instantly and get one instant confirmation from a trusted third party. But it would cost a lot more than $1 to send it to someone outside of the UK.

I can tell that this is all some game for you where values go up and down in units of what you consider "real money" (ie. USD or some other fiat). Have fun. I have an interest in using crypto as money and Segwit2x would've made BTC more like BCH, which can be used as money. Have you ever used BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:52:36
The majority have no clue what they are doing. Others are just making money from people buying in on exchanges but never actually moving the coins around. They could be trading apples as long as there was enough hype about apples in the news to make people think they can make money from apples. There's no value in this. None at all. It's called a bubble.
The value of bitcoin was as a decentralised, trustless digital cash. A store of value that you can actually spend. That's something we really need as a society. We don't need another way for rich people to store wealth.

Nah. BCH to the moon. If you bought BTC after the BCH fork, it sucks to be you. Those who remember what BTC used to be like know it's a shadow of its former self. BCH happened because some people thankfully refused to let go of the original dream of Bitcoin: peer-to-peer electronic cash.

This is true and seems to be the biggest misunderstanding that people have with bitcoin and "real money".  There are two reasons that it's annoying to call bitcoin a "virtual" currency: first, as you say, all major currencies are virtual anyway, and secondly, it makes it seem like only banks can run a currency while we, the lowly people, can only run a "virtual" currency.
The real difference with bitcoin is that it's virtual but doesn't rely on trust.  Before bitcoin there were two options: use physical currency like gold and don't trust anyone, or use virtual currency which is far more convenient but trust the banks.  Bitcoin is the best of both worlds.
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:53:55
A press release should probably briefly explain what a currency is, ie. a means to trade things of value indirectly and asynchronously.  Most people unfortunately have the idea that money itself has value and I think this is a barrier to bitcoin adoption since you can't even hold a bitcoin even if you want to.

I first heard RMS suggest this idea a few years ago.  Music is and should be basically free to distribute on the Internet.  But when you play some music you have the option to press a button that donates a small amount of money to the artist.  You might press this once every time you listen or just once if you think the music is good enough.  Sometimes if you're really enjoying it you will press it multiple times.  Bitcoin actually makes this sort of thing viable.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:33:19
Just like it would if you bought GBP or EUR from the bureau de change.  The good thing is when you buy bitcoin you do it once and can spend it all over the world.

Yeah this is what I'd really like bitcoin to be in the future.  Most people are just thinking about it as something that they buy with USD etc. and sell for USD again.  I want to be paid in bitcoin and then spend those bitcoins on things that I want/need.  Even reddit doesn't *really* accept BTC for gold, they use a service that takes BTC from users and gives them USD.
@_date: 2013-03-24 12:03:42

Yeah it's too late to set it up, there's a code on the page that you have to enter somewhere, but because I have nowhere to enter it it doesn't work.

That's way too technical for the average person.  If you expect everyone to understand how it really works then I wouldn't expect many people to actually use it.  If anyone asks about copying the wallet file then you can just say the system knows that they still refer to the same coins and you can't spend them twice.

I read that, I understand what Google 2-step verification is and it works.  When you log in to your Google account it sends a code to your phone.  That does not help you log in to Bitcoin-24.  That's why I said it's the wrong link they give.  I still don't know what "Google Authenticator" is.
