100% on this. The question comes up so much (too much.) If any of us could really time the market, we would be drinking champagne on our yachts instead of hunting for an edge in forums. 
On a **day-to-day short-term** timeline, Bitcoin is *purely speculative* as far as investing is concerned, too many weird and unpredictable factors drive movement. On a **long-term basis**, if you believe in the philosophy, the technology, and the opportunity, then just buy at a price that feels comfortable and set a time horizon.

What this guy said. I think you're just being dense. That isn't a Coinbase issue, that's a user-intelligence issue. 
If you don't know how to do that, should you really be investing in anything at all....?

If crypto currencies were to achieve 3% of total currency volume, and Bitcoin were to hold ~50% of that share, that would place BTC at a speculative limit of having a $2.25 Trillion market cap.... or ~$107k/BTC 
This is of course fuzzy math, and accounts for no factors that things like speculation, derivatives, regulation, etc. places on it. 
All that being said:
Do I like the chances of 3% of currency volume moving to crypto in the next five years? Yes. 
Do I like the chances that BTC remains the chosen store of value and a ~50% share of total crypto value? Yes. 
If for no other reason than adoption rates and macro-economics, I'm bullish on BTC achieving $15k/BTC by Q4 2018.

The level of support that has been demonstrated for $4800+, combined with increased adoption means it's unlikely to think that a sub $5000 price is going to happen or sustain for long (IMO.) 
Currently "priced-in" are China concerns, JPMorgan doubt, international participation, etc. BTC weathered that storm. 
Amazon are likely to announce a Bitcoin integration on their October 26th earnings call, which would likely trigger further adoption. 
If Cryptocurrencies achieve a 3% global share of currency supply, and Bitcoin is ~50% of that share, that places BTC at a speculative limit of having a ~$2.25 Trillion Market Cap.... this leaves plenty of upside potential.
There are dips, but overall the trend line keeps up-and-to-the-right. Invest what you can afford to lose, don't panic during downturns. If you believe in the fundamental merits of crypto, and the superiority of Bitcoin, then that leaves few possible long term possibilities. Money is a bubble that never truly bursts.
