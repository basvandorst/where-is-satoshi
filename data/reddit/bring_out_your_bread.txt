Ah! I see your point now.  Fair enough and to me that's just as possible as any of the other scenarios or official story, if not more so.

Noted and not aiming to turn this into a truther debate, as we could go back and fourth till time ends.  I was mainly just illustrating the point that with enough context 's attempt to cast one scenario as the simpler of 2 options seems incredibly dishonest.
Also, you use "vs" in a very interesting way here. Logic tells me it makes sense but I don't think I've ever seen it used in that phrasing before.  Did you pick it up somewhere? Is it regional?

1. Establish covert connections deep within the Taliban, over decades. Embed a group, if not multiple groups, of extremists in the US with cover stories. Fund and train them at US flight schools to fly commercial aircraft, override autopilot functions, perform uncommon maneuvers under extreme duress. Ensure they have the means and will necessary to kill and subdue an entire aircraft full of people and gain access to the cabin. Ensure they are able to maintain control long enough to effectively crash a massive plane into a metropolis sky scraper. Ensure they do so in such a way that it causes the collapse of the sky scraper that was specifically designed to withstand such an impact. Twice. Then also do the exact same thing on 2 more planes and crash one into the military headquarters of the US, at high speed, a few meters above the ground.
2. Coordinate with commonly contracted plane manufactures to install a few backdoors and fail-safes into their relatively straightforward autopilot system for a few extra million in kickbacks.
I mean, come on dude. This is a very easy game to play.

I agree with you.  Its the other guy who seems to think this is implausible.
