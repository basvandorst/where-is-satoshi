Bought something 5 hours ago and it still hasn't gone through... Blockchain.info supposedly automatically sets the fees but still not a single verification.
How long should I be expecting a transaction with 0.0002431 BTC fee to take? Kinda puts me off of using crypto currencies tbh if you have to pay an added premium for any transaction to actually go through...

Interesting. That's the only place I've been able to get verified. lol
Both of my photo ID's (Drivers license and BC ID) are expired so it's been impossible to get verified elsewhere. Cavirtex doesn't accept passports as valid ID :(

True. I have bought total of 0.1BTC, but I have to use PayPal, so I had to use VirWox, which has been a very shitty experience and a total waste of money. I horribly overpaid by ~$24 considering I spent $54 total and 0.1BTC is ~$20 actual price. Due to the 48 hour hold, I haven't yet received the BTC. I don't know what to do now.

As a noob, how are they not real? If people are buying at $780, will I not get $780? Will I somehow get corn instead of USD? Explain please.

Is even the Jalapeno not worth it? $274, 5GH/s, 5W. According to a calculator the cost of running it is $0.02 a day  set rate slightly higher than it is for me), and making $1.31 a day ($1.29 profit). I know the calculator is a rough estimate, but that still seems pretty decent to me.

No. I sent them a support email asking about the process and never heard back. I don't trust those that don't speak. :D

What is best to do with Bitcoin and where should they be bought? I'm looking at btc-e, and it looks pretty cool. I'm not sure if I want to just buy and hold, or buy and trade on btc-e.

What would be the reason for using CampBX? Is the exchange rate better than cryptxchange? Does it require verification using a bunch of documents/ID's?
I forgot to mention before you commented that I'm in Canada.

Good news! They agreed to issue a refund. Got my money back! :D

I'd like to buy your BTC at $15.50. You'd make a lot of money.

I looked on localbitcoins, though since I live in a small town there was nobody nearby besides some an hour away and wanting ~$270 per btc, which is a bit steep considering it's available on btc-e right now for $196.

But 0.009BTC a day is currently $1.83 USD. That still seems pretty good considering the price of BTC in USD is steadily rising, so that BTC will still be going into your wallet each day and will make you a lot more in the long run if you sell later in time.
Sure it will take a few months to make the $274 back and won't be seeing that money for a long while, but then that's still at it's current exchange rate. That BTC will still be there a year later to sell and make a pretty good profit.
Long-term benefits seems to outweigh the short-term, in my eyes. If I'm still wrong, please explain. :)

Why does everyone say fiat here? I have never heard of that word until I started reading this sub-reddit and other bitcoin websites yesterday.
Because of the post timer I'll ask my other question here:
Why on earth do they make it so easy for someone to easily put a small camera that will instantly get and could even instantly use your private key QR code on the ticket before you even have the ticket in your pocket? Or even just get a picture of the QR code on their handheld phone or camera. They could even go as far as adding a second camera that looks at the screen and sends a signal to the other camera to activate the QR code when it detects the final screen.
Granted the second part is a little far-fetched, but this still seems very unsecure and very easy to lose your money before you get home and see your wallet isn't any different from before you used the ATM.
