Except, doing this requires a hard fork, and thus two new chains are born. That would be identical to the Bitcoin Cash fork.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:57:18
If you make a change requiring a hardfork, there will be nodes which update and nodes which do not. You will end up with two chains. "Consensus" is usually a term meaning a majority of nodes, or a specific proportion - not *all of them*.

I don't think P2SH saves net space on the blockchain. The full redeem script needs included in the transaction which spends from the P2SH address.

Seriously, I am not trying to insult the intelligence of anyone here. I just think it would be beneficial for people to do wider reading. I believe that this place can act as a big echo chamber at times, where any other opinions are shunned.

@_date: 2018-01-12 06:15:39
This may have been the case in 2010 on a tiny network where abandoned nodes have no reason to continue on the old chain, but on the current network any hard fork will not have 100% consensus. Take Bitcoin Cash, for example. Core was the chain "left behind", but obviously both chains exist. It would never be unanimous even if BCH was obviously a superior change - because a hard fork is *always* seen as contentious due to some people disagreeing with the change.

What's the practical difference? A 2mb blocksize fork is a 2mb blocksize fork.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:55:21
Yes, but the nodes still need to be updated to know "ok, after block  these new validation rules are implemented". That system just ensures that the hard fork occurs in an orderly manner. Nodes can still refuse the changes.

If 51% of your country conspires, they can easily steal everyone's food and money. 51% of the world can invade everyone else and take over. That's the point of the decentralised network, it relies on the good of the average person. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:34:41
That simply isn't how a hard fork works. Nodes updated via a hard fork, by definition, publish blocks that will not be accepted by non-updated nodes.

If people were able to take advantage of it, the arbitrage gap would gradually close. The disparity in value simply means that there is some difficulty in acquiring coins in those regions due to currency conversion problems, liquidity issues etc.

This is actually a fantastic idea, I imagine it has been had before but never implemented. I'm not sure if it entirely fixes spam tx though, since spammers could just spin up clusters to "mine" spam transactions. Definitely worthy of some further research/modelling though.
Edit: The PoW needs to be quite fast to verify though, otherwise spamming invalid ones could dos nodes

No, just illegal too. People own Coinbase, in contrast to no one owning Bitcoin.

Yeah, 2x was a bit of a shitshow - but that was due to a programming error that stopped the fork activating. 
My first comment was about a blocksize fork, and clearly no one will ever agree about that...

That's simply untrue. Do you think it would be a good idea to educate yourself about the BCH fork and make your decisions based on that, rather than just base your opinions off the one-sided view which is allowed here?

Coinbase seems to be having issues with broadcasting transactions (or with liquidity...). I had the same problem but it resolved after a few hours. 
Check the blockchain to see if you're just waiting on confirmations, (Electrum does show unconfirmed transactions too). If there's no transaction sent, the best you can do is contact coinbase's support and wait for a response.

Fluctuations are caused by the actions of people and have nothing to do with the validity of the technology. That said, the success of cryptocurrency as a technology is not necessarily coupled to the price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:42:16
Believe it or not, there is an inherent risk in holding bitcoin. No one can predict the future, so hedging your bets is the safest. This is especially true for people whose livelihoods are at stake.
I personally believe in cryptocurrency as a technology, but don't place 100% of my savings into bitcoin. I am happy to purchase some and cash out at a profit in addition to holding some long-term.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:43:07


How so? If the algorithm is changed it could easily be implemented such that the cost of mining is approximately equivalent across the change. In either case, by that time a majority of coins will hopefully be in circulation so a large increase/decrease in supply from mining wouldn't swing the price as much.

Your efficiency in terms of power and hardware cost won't be large enough to justify investment at a small scale IMO.

Yes, you will need to run a bitcoin wallet on your server and make integrations to provide one of your receiving addresses to your customers when an order is made, notify once the transaction is confirmed etc. In the simplest implementation, you could have just a single receiving address.

Is localbitcoins really not an option? Cash deposit without ID verification is pretty common (depends on your country, though).
As far as reassuring your father goes, coinbase is a pretty large business with some sort of corporate responsibility. And they don't have much to gain from stealing a random photograph of a license when their business model revolves around their fees.

You might want to take a look at the deposit address on both blockchains to see what happened. If that is where your BTC ended up, it is either a bug in Breadwallet (very concerning - I would definitely get onto them) or you made a mistake.

Looks like Breadwallet made a mistake and broadcasted the transaction on the BTC chain. If you talk to Kraken, they might be able to help you since they do own that BTC address as well but they aren't obligated to.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:53:33

Floating point numbers aren't used for this as it's really an integer quantity of satoshi. And the total quantity is 21 million whole bitcoins *times* 100,000,000 satoshi per Bitcoin, not just 21 million units.

I think the currency is divisible enough as it is, at least for a significant amount of time into the future.
For the satoshi to exceed the smallest division of the USD (one cent) in value, the BTC price would have to exceed 100 million USD. And despite the claims of "moon" I think we are a ways away from that.

Interestingly enough, this isn't always how the density of an alloy comes out. Often, the volume changes when the metals combine due to a change in the lattice structure and the material ends up with a higher or lower density as a result. E.g. Steel is actually more dense than its densest component, iron.

Yes, but only one set is 'true' bitcoin, the other belongs to the fork.
Like I said, this doesn't mean the actual value of your wallet will double. The value of the original and forked bitcoin will balance out to roughly the value of the original before the fork.
For example, the forked coin might be worth 40%, and the original coin 60%. No idea on how these numbers will work out if the fork really happens, depends on the economics of the situation.
I imagine the forked variant would be worth very little initially as widespread support would be limited, leading to non-liquid coins.

Buy the (fucking) dip. Buy coin when it's cheap - ideally at the 'bottom' of a price dip.

The first blocks from each side of the fork would both build on the same block (the last one in the BTC chain before the split). Effectively, you end up with two "copies" of the same coin, each of which is only usable on one fork of the blockchain.
If the forked bitcoin has any real value, this is where the big altercation with pricing comes in. They can't be worth the same, as this would require the blockchain's market cap to instantly double. So both coin variants are worth less than pre-fork BTC, at least for some time.
That said, you will have ownership of the corresponding coins in both blockchains as you would have the corresponding private key/seed to use the 'same' wallet in both chains.
