I threw my life savings into bitcoin when it was $750.
Once I fully understood how it worked, I grew excited. I did some math on the full potential of bitcoin IF it became a global store of value.
It has the potential to have the purchasing power (in today’s dollars) of between $10 to $100 million dollars.
There is A LOT of financial entropy because of debt and derivatives and what these big banks understand is that bitcoin is an empty gas tank that is able to store ALL of that value in a nice and neat manner.

People need to fucking use it.

Your scenario doesn’t make any sense and I get it...you’re resorting to stupidity to derail the argument.
By your logic, money gets its value from just holding it. Which makes no sense. How is this money?
Money has value because a group of people use and accept it in exchange for value.
Also, day trading does nothing to bitcoin because it isn’t settled on the main chain...it’s settled on a third party exchange UNLESS you were to remove it from the exchange. 
I don’t think you understand this or much about bitcoin and money.

You’re regurgitating the same stupid cut and paste argument every other idiot “hodler” is spitting out.
Do you know why the 10,000 bitcoin guy is significant? It’s because it’s the first known transaction of bitcoin (use).
Do you know where the term hodl came from? 
It’s from the drunk rant of a degenerate trader who couldnt time the markets, got burned and declared it best to hold.
For fucks sake. 
Holding something does NOT give it utility as money or currency. Spending it does.
There’s a reason why fiat is more useful at the moment than bitcoin...and it’s because people fucking use it!

Problem with your viewpoint is that you’re viewing the value of bitcoin through a fiat perspective, from your mention of supply and demand.

This is a world where it is used as it was intended, a ledger for value transfer.

What the fuck are you talking about and how is this relating to what I’m saying? You’re being a cunt and cherry picking comments I made on this thread and stating “sure I’ll pick this one here to call him out on”
Yes, I understand gold and it’s history. I’ll take your lack of understanding one step further and say that gold became outdated as a medium of exchange due to the industrial revolution because it was inefficient in keeping up with the speed of commerce. Given the new technologies that were emerging.
Adoption of fiat and checking in banking was a huge innovation to fit the needs of the era.
Today we have the fucking internet and fiat cannot keep pace and bitcoin will replace it.
History lesson you fuck.
Have you ever seen the historical charts for gold?
I suggest you look at it...gold is highly manipulated and it is complete fucking horse shit to call it a “store of value”. Gee gold was dog shit back in 2000 and gee golly, it had an all time high during the 70s after the usd /gold exchange was banned.
Also I have no fucking clue what the fuck you’re talking about with day trading affecting the price. No fucking shit. What was this horse shit in response to?

@_date: 2019-02-24 10:20:24
Have you ever tried buying or selling a home for $30 million dollars? 
Ever try selling $100 million in gold?
What about selling a $300 million dollar painting?
Or $1 billion in company stocks?
All of these are (with the exception of stocks) are traditional stores of value. They all have bottle necks.
They require a broker, who will take a cut. That broker then needs to find you a market, this can take weeks, months, years. Once you do find a buyer/seller. Then you need to get banks/lawyers involved and the process is very slow and expensive.
Bitcoin is the first protocol to be able to move huge sums of value in a trustless manner. (This isn’t to say that banks, lawyers and brokers will disappear...but the overall process will be much more streamlined and efficient).
This is the smaller part.
The larger part, the part I overlooked when I first got into bitcoin is the access to the unbanked.
The greater majority of the worlds population does not have access to banking, meaning...they are off the grid.
If bitcoin did become the global standard and financial access was given to let’s say half of that population, it will provide immense purchasing power. After all, what gives money value are people using it and if you include a few billion people into that figure....
So when you couple just these small points together...a $1 million dollar (in today’s dollars) purchasing power of 1 bitcoin is complete dog shit.
@_date: 2019-02-26 01:02:19
I think if bitcoin ever reaches this level, mining as we know it will be drastically different. The days of having mining farms and upgrading asic miners every few months will be gone. 
In this scenario where if bitcoin were the global standard, you have to imagine what is at stake. I don’t see a bunch of asic mining farms in China doing the job. If we are talking about a protocol protecting trillions, possibly even quadrillions in assets... then the network hashrate will be absolutely insane compared to today’s hash.
I think the network hashrate will somehow be streamlined with idle energy and processing power, along with mining farms. 
I mean, just consider how many office buildings throughout the world leave their lights on 24/7. If this were streamlined, imagine leaving the lights on paying the bills from hitting block rewards?
Bitcoin will either succeed in becoming the global standard or fail and go to zero. I don’t see a middle ground and I don’t see it failing.
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:42:06
Let’s argue both extremes:
If everyone held bitcoin but no one spent it, it would be useless as money and have zero value.
If everyone spent bitcoin but no one held it, it’s value would sky rocket on sheer utility alone.
Holding does nothing for a protocol that is trying to become the first global ledger of value.
@_date: 2019-02-23 16:40:15

@_date: 2019-02-10 01:01:51
Sure it’s used as a store of value but so are a lot of other things. Gold has more users at the moment. 
All of the demand it has as a manufacturing component for chipsets, wiring, to jewelry and money...this is a demand and evidence of a user base.
Get off your high horse and think it through instead of regurgitating nonsense.
@_date: 2019-02-12 00:04:09
This is not true.
Chicken or the egg scenario here and unfortunately bitcoin needs to be used for it to gain value. The larger the user base, the more transactions that occur, the more valuable it will become.
Buying and holding will do nothing for bitcoin as a whole, for the individual...maybe.
The 10,000 bitcoins spent for pizza did far more for bitcoin because it is the first known transaction to occur.
Please stop the echo chamber regurgitation of hodling magically making us all rich. It simply isn’t so and is destructive to the entire ecosystem.

Purchase sure.
If bitcoin reaches the levels I am talking about, this will be a scenario where no one is purchasing bitcoin but rather bitcoin is THE standard. 
There will be a “crossing of the rubicon”, where the bitcoin/fiat purchasing will enter a point of no return. This will happen once bitcoin reaches a very commanding level of purchasing power. During this period, I’m expecting to see the last and final parabolic move of bitcoins purchasing power into what will become near its final state of price discovery.
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:52:45

@_date: 2019-02-24 12:56:01
Interesting set of questions, I would be happy to share my thoughts! I’m typing from my phone, so forgive my lack of formatting:
1- my personal opinion, but I think you get only 1 chance with something like bitcoin. We all know it’s history now. It was a project and no one knew it would succeed and it arrived at this point organically. 
Because of this, there is a sense to trust it a bit more.
Every protocol that has come since, there is the specter of financial interests involved and a lack of trust. 
2- market penetration - First movers advantage and also because it was the first and started off as just a project that had no guarantee for success, I believe it will have greater acceptance.
As far as use case goes, security. It has one job to do and that is be a secure decentralized ledger and it is doing that remarkably well. 
Also I’m aware compared to national currencies, bitcoin has near non existent market penetration. I was talking about crypto market penetration.
3- a good amount of hashpower comes from China, they have had first mover advantage here. 
If bitcoin does become the global standard, this will change as even more miners and equipment manufacturers will enter the field and increase research and development. 
Just remember, the first cars were carriages with 3-4 bicycle wheels and a pull break.
4- I don’t see anything better coming along. In my opinion, bitcoin will either fail or become the world standard. I don’t see a middle ground. 
As for proof of stake. It’s tough to say because it hasn’t been proven to bitcoins scale.
Pow is far from being perfect though with the centralization of mining pools and how the block reward, mining costs, difficulty rate all eventually play in to encourage this.
That was a pretty long reply haha.
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:01:08
Gold has a much much much larger user base, this is what is propping up its value.
I don’t doubt bitcoin being the best form of money for the digital age we live in but it’s purchasing power is not going anywhere until more people begin to use it.
@_date: 2019-02-24 00:29:23

I don’t own gold, I own bitcoin (much more than you), and your echo chamber thinking is exactly what is wrong with the “community”.

You don’t understand shit and are jumbling up what “hodling” is to bitcoin vs saving is to fiat.
This isn’t the same thing.
Fiat is light years ahead of bitcoin at the moment as far as money is concerned. It’s being used.
Bitcoin needs to be used.
My point in saying ALL of this shit is that if the community were to switch their groupthink into ways of spending bitcoin vs “hodling”, it’s a better overall message of what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:46:22
If everything in the world is valued in bitcoin, the block reward for transactions would be more than enough incentive
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:18:15
To further add to your post:
One thing I never took into account when I became a bitcoin believer is the unbanked population...which is in the billions.
This will basically give the biggest user base of a supply of money, ever.
Can you imagine what the purchasing power of bitcoin would be if the user base was that large?

I definitely get it.
I think we are very very early in this thing and in a few years mining will be more evenly distributed.
I was commending him on his efforts and education on this, more than anything. His attention to detail in documenting this is a valuable resource and snapshot of the current times.
My soapbox prediction is that mining will become a lot more effortless in the near future. The mining chipset ecosystem is very small and new. Once some serious R&amp;D is put into place and a few breakthroughs are had, this whole discussion will seem archaic and dated.
Best of luck.

If there’s a critical bug then it could fail but I don’t see this being the case if it gets to that level.
Encryption getting hacked would mean hacking of a single address and not the entire blockchain. 
It would be difficult to tax bitcoin holders directly. I think taxes would have to shift into being consumption taxes rather than income taxes, which by the way are dishonest.

You’re confusing store of value and “hodling”.
Store of value is something you put your money into to retain value vs inflation.
Hodling is a entirely different concept

Children in a modern society are not the same children growing up 300+ years ago.
People are socially more specialized now and there are laws etc. A kid growing up 600 years ago needs to be exposed to whatever their global norm is.
Same applies to today, whatever a persons global norm is, will make them more “normal”.
600 years ago, a child who learned sexuality by 10 and learning to kill an animal for food by 12  and people by 14 could be normal.
Obviously, a kid like that will be jailed or in severe counseling using modern standards because they would be against the norm.

Never said it had the same dollar value for the last 7 to 8 decades, i said there are incentives in place to keep the prices relatively stable.

I disagree:
We are in the digital age. 
Other asset classes are not as fluid and present many many bottle necks when transacting with them.
Gold and bitcoin (and any other asset) are one in the same as in, they represent a tally of some agreed upon value.
Because of the internet and how we communicate value, bitcoin is far more superior.

Going to ramble a bit:
Inflation is supposed to be controlled by the interest rate. In theory, if you increase rates, you make credit (capital) harder to obtain and its supposed to encourage saving.
Decreasing rates will encourage spending/investing due to cheaper capital and lower savings rates in banks. 
The central bank has been decreasing rates year after year and this is not good. 
Its a complex problem but its causing inflated asset prices due to increased spending. 
Heres one example of how its chaotic:
Lets say the interest rates go down by say...   .25% , this will decrease the monthly mortgage / payment required for a borrower.
Every time you lower the rates, it introduces another “layer” of borrowers that are able to afford the monthly payments etc.
The huge problem we face right now is two fold:
-Increasing the interest rates will cause defaults to happen and slow the economy. No one has any idea how this will affect the derivatives market. By most accounts, its pretty scary. 
-further decreasing the interest rates is accelerating the wealth divide but we need to keep rates low to keep the market moving because no one has any idea how the derivatives market will be affected if we dont keep this going.

I’m going to give you the benefit of doubt, you sound like a jackass who has some need to constantly flash his badge of l I have xyz credentials, I’m right”. 
Your IQ must not have been high to begin with.
My original comment was on how hodling was destructive groupthink on bitcoin, especially it being a protocol for money in its infancy. The idea of hodling also came about from a traders drunken rant because he was unable to correctly time the markets.
Money is meant to be used in transaction for it to have value.
My other argument was the 10,000 bitcoin for pizza guy did more for the ecosystem because it was the first noted transaction of bitcoin in exchange for a good.
I provided a model with 2 extremes. Yes I understand reality is somewhere in between.
1- if every owner of bitcoin held it and never spent it, it would have zero value.
2- if no one held bitcoin but everyone spent it, it would have extreme value due to utility.
How is my thinking off?

Thing you’re forgetting is that a lot of consumer staple goods have incentivized shelters from the govt.
They pay farmers to over/under produce or import/export etc. 
Milk, eggs, bread is typically abundant and cheap. 
If you want to see the effects of inflation, always look at unprotected assets that are open to market volatility stocks, real estate etc.
The reason why most americans don’t understand inflation is that lower end goods dont see much price fluctuation.
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:32:45
How is the global economy going to experience a soft landing from the continued lowering of interest rates?
Since the late 70s, mortgage rates have experienced a continual decrease.
This means, if youre in your 40s, youve never understood real estate as being a bad investment.
Also, you can throw your weight around with claiming to understand the x,y,z of our financial markets but at the end of the day, you’re still in the same boat as us so-called losers heading down the same shit course.
Bottom line is, people rightfully have a huge distrust of the government and financial institutions and having a shitty half baked discussion about it on a subreddit is one of the last bastions of free discourse people have with one another.

I bought in early 2017 and went all in.
When it hit near $20,000 it was a near life changing amount of money.
I didn’t sell anything. I’ve been accumulating every paycheck regardless of price and strongly believe this technology will reshape the world.
I’ve gone full retard and 100% of my investment/ savings is in this and I will not sell until I can buy a luxury condo in manhattan with 1 bitcoin.
Then I’ll consider selling my first.
Worst thing that can happen to me in life is I go broke on this and move in with my parents and I don’t see that happening.

Bitcoin is decentralized, has a huge network hashrate and market penetration.
Why would anyone choose a private shitcoin over this? How do you get people to cooperate on a global level? There’s no central point of attack.
It’s not like ripple or facebook coin or some country issuing their own currency.
There are lots of synergies at play that give bitcoin value and the people who just see it as “code” don’t get it and probably won’t ever get it till it’s too late

The us gov wanting to protect the value of the dollar doesn’t make sense.
If you truly think about it, destruction of the dollar will hurt the little guy the most and who gives two squats about us.
Bitcoin is the first form of money in modern industrial history, where we can account for a hard cap of global value. Do not underestimate the absolute importance of this.
There’s clear evidence every major institution is circling around this like a bunch of vultures and of course they will say it’s a scam to dissuade the little guy from buying in...until it’s too late
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:18:37
You realize how low the global interest rates have been at record lows?
15+ years 
Our answer to 2008 was even more accessible capital. On top of all that, every central bank in the world is offering record low interest rates.
How is this not going to lead to a financial disaster? Derivatives have ballooned since 2008. There is a considerable amount of financial entropy out there and that is not a good thing.

If we had a fiat collapse, we are looking at the same logistical hurdles you’re mentioning only difference is...once fiat is devalued beyond a critical point...people in large will lose faith in it.
Funny you mention adoption is mentally forced. I was telling my friends that the biggest contribution a bitcoin etf approval will bring is changing the narrative from it being a scam to a legit investment vehicle.
It will change the psychology of normal folks and by then, it’ll be too late for them to buy a decent amount because the price appreciation will make it out of reach for most
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:51:18
If there is buying, it’s slow.
You need to remember, when bitcoin is being bought out by countries...they will print money to do so and you will see a simultaneous destruction of fiat via hyper inflation.
