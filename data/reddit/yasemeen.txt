This was my first time in the business and it looks like I screwed up..coinbase wasn't verifying me so I wanted a good quick alternative during the dip and this website was recommended. I bought at 13k and now it went up and it looks like all I made was 40 bucks lol. I thought I was  'just buying Bitcoins' but really I have no idea what is currently going on. Whats really sad is that I bought at a "good time" and it's going up right now and I could have made a good amount of profit lol

GUYS PLEASE HELP ME IAM EXTREMELY DESPERATE AND LOST! I am brand new to the business and I was trying to buy at dip but coinbase wasn't verifying me so I was looking for a quick good alternative and a website called Rofx.net was recommended to me. So I went ahead and bought 1650 USD at 13k ...now it's saying that my profit is 0.00198700 BTC which is about 30 USD!?! lol how is this possible it went up more than 3k and 30 bucks is all I made?!?! Someone, please help I really have no clue whats going on and how this whole thing works. Call me stupid and dumb for putting in all that money I know I screwed up. But please just help me figure out whats going on. Anyone have experience with this website before?! THANK YOU, I REALLY APPRECIATE IT!!

God No I bought the equivalent of 1650 USD when BTC was at 13k ��
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:26:08
My bad...I put in 1650 USD
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:12:07
Aight you telling me I fucked up isn't helping though cause I already know I did. What do you think I should do next? Just take out my money when my trial period ends? Actually, even though they already opened up a package for me my money was rejected for some reason and I have to resend it...do you think I shouldn't resend it all together and just take my money back without any profit or should I resend it cause I would still make something right? please advise me
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:34:10
Yeah I just realized I have like 50 different currencies in my question lol my bad

Any type of advice would be highly appreciated!
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:55:27
I got scholarship money I am not investing my student loans..there's a diffrence+ I am actually only 3k-ish in debt but that's bc I am a first-year student but in 4 yrs yeah it'll be around 30k
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:41:14
Yes, this is correct I haven't received profit yet though. I will update this thread when I do though. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:30:28
Why? Instead of wasting money I am willing to already loose I am thinking of investing it..Sounds sane to me 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:23:06
Hided?? WOW
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:11:10
