I think I see what you're getting at, but I do not think that invalidates the concept.  In the end, all digital media is just lines of code, just like the blockchain.  You would have to incorporate code into the media that has some connection to that blockchain ledger.  When a person wants to trade/sell that media, the code can look at the ledger to see if that person's account is the most recent holder of the media.
Maybe a good question is, Is it possible to distinguish between one bitcoin and another?  for example, is there something in the information for the first bitcoin ever mined, vs the last?

This is one of the bigger problems, I think.  I can't envision a system where the two are separate.  You could probably imbed a unique identifier into the media which could be referenced by the blockchain, but that would be too easy to remove and hence not help at all.

To a degree, yes.  The problem with current DRM technology is that it is too restrictive to the consumer and is set up in such a way to create a creator vs customer mentality when it should a creator vs Pirate idea.  I would like to see something that gives the tools to the creaters/distributors to fight piracy without restricting the consumers desires and wants(like a secondary market).  Unfortunately, with the ease of copying, that is a tough thing to find.


Sure, why not?  I'm not saying patent the entire bitcoin concept, but the application of it digital media I believe is a possibility.  Plus if you don't patent an idea, that is when the big guys just jump in and steal it for themselves and leave the little guy screwed.
