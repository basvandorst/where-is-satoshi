"This place" was never intended for the speculators, but for discussion of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange.  In recent times the speculation activity has outshone the more fundamental and serious discussion.  When the present period of volatility is over we may see the return of more interesting discussion and a recession of inflammatory rhetoric like this.

Oh good, another "income tax is unconstitutional" thread.

Try reading your post again without the second paragraph.  See how much better that is?

I was futilely hoping it was just that block 230837 was taking slightly longer to find.  This can be anywhere between "not good" and "very bad".

If I understand, you're saying it would be desirable if the proof-of-work for a cryptocurrency had a side effect of providing a useful service to somebody.
If there's a way, maybe it means replacing proof-of-work with proof-of-service.  Suppose that this new protocol, instead of allowing miners to pick any arbitrary nonce, restricts them to choosing a nonce that could only have been obtained by performing a quantum of service (relaying a network packet, say).  The protocol would also have to standardize the thing-to-be-hashed, to prevent miners from changing some other part of the block in order to re-use the same proof-of-service, essentially degenerating into the old proof-of-work system.
In order for proof-of-service to be accepted, everyone must be able to verify that the block has been generated in accordance with the protocol rules, and that means everyone must be able to prove that the nonce corresponds to a quantum of service that was actually performed.  Depending on the nature of the service, that might be difficult or impossible, especially while remaining decentralized.
I think it's a really neat idea to try to design a proof-of-work that produces something other than waste heat (not that that can't be useful in suitable climes); I just can't wrap my mind around how mining effort could possibly be harnessed like that in a distributed-verifiable manner.

It appears to be well underway, unless this flavor of content is normal for [businessinsider]( and [arstechnica](

Filling all the intervening bid orders on the way down, maybe?

Raise the conventional acceptance threshold from 6 to 100 trillion.

So the Market Depth chart will soon ditch bid/ask in favor of catch/pitch.

I misread that as
