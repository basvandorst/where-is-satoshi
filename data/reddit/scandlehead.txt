only "problem" I just realized with bisq--only work in "larger" tx, i.e., the smallest tx available require at *least* I think it was 0.01 BTC, which is a bit too rich for my blood rn lol.  Hopefully AST's program is a bit more "user-friendly?" They are launching their "token swap" Feb. 1!

Damn, you gettem Bitcoin-Yoda!!  I, like those "idiots," just got into crypto not too long ago--and have used Coinbase, binance, hitbtc (my god) etc., until I learned of Airswap (AST) and the concept --which seemes so obvious once hearing about it--of p2p trading!!  Wow.  Duh... then i goggled p2p crypto exchange.. BOOM (cuz ya know, I dont wanna look like a TOTAL dweeb, storming out into steemit with my "new" idea Airswap [lol]) So I see bisq, and here I am!

A mining rig and a new computer to mine BTC on. edit: Duh....

Wow.  Just went over to "r(slash)btc".  I actually feel kind of sick to my stomach.  What insanity.  I can't believe I fell for that :/  On a lighter note, I feel slightly refreshed.  Now, back to work.

Yes.  ANYTIME i'm asked again for login info on a site that I knew I'd already enetered it and saved--obvious red flag... This is why saving passes/ keychains can be useful, because then it becomes apparent when being phished.

Because being artificially manipulated.

People are very sensitive at the moment.

Depends what you're doing with it, where your using it, etc.  Average time ime is around 25-30 min. for "full confirmation", which is usually about 3 confirmations.  Ten minutes a block, yup that's about right.  But, it's a helluva a lot \*cheaper\* than it was..

Thank you  :)

What u mean "banks?"  As you referenced w/ Mt. Gox:  we don't \*need\* banks to do that to us lol.  And I kind of disagree.  I don't think that will happen.  With the advent of DEXs.. I don't see why we'd need to.  All they need is some kind of cathcy, "simplistic" way to organize and store keys and we're good.  Ethereum--though it's widely underused and understood, imo - it is a but complicated--already \*has\* Ethereum Name Service which anables users to match their Public Key addy with a much easier to recall name, like an email address, etc.  For example, you can send me ETH to miaddress.eth now intead of 0x5tahddkdkdkdkdkdxxx.... whatever.  That's pretty cool, right?  They have "brain wallets" too...

Pretty sure I've encountered the dude w/ glasses online at least a couple times.  He was quite helpful.  It's a shame all my coins are gone now - due to the bear market, of course.

I'll get the pitchforks!   Jed, you bring the vasoline!  (His lips looked parched - what?)
@_date: 2018-10-02 11:33:04
must be *recessive* (because they're blue).
edit: clarity
edit 2: TIL it's not funny if you have to explain it. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 11:31:38
Believe it or not, those were mine.  
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:11:26
Lol, uhhh.... That's pretty much exact;y what he is doing lol
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:11:15
Frankly, I'd be amazed if most real dads didnt too much like crypto reddit, due to most of it being kinda super hostile and crazy, I could be wrong. How many dads up in here??
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:09:57
Uhh... None of those were really "tips" on mining, nor were they things difficult to find--basically pointless. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:09:36
So conflicted about this. I guess it all equals out in the end lol. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:22:13
I wholeheartedly agree.  But good luck with that around here :/
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:20:03
I am.  
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:16:41
Oh yeah?  So... in 2140 Satoshi will reveal themselves?  Wow... he IS a god then lol.  
And what part of just bc someone Can do something doens't mean they should or will... As much as an ass as CSW is, it would not surprise me in the least if he were actually SN. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:29:30
I've heard something like that before, yes.  Don't see the relevance, though.  Being *able* to do something doesn't mean you have to do it lol.  So what if he can prove it but hasn't?  Why should he prove anything?  One thing's for sure: there's quite a bit of back-story and current story that I'm sure neither I, nor most anyone else is privy to.   
@_date: 2018-11-28 07:28:21
Nice:)
