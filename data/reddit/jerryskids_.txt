What's bitcoin core? I know what Bitcoin is, and what Bcash is, but not bitcoin core.

But yes your post was rather irrelevant to the thread; according to what you just said all cryptos shouldn't have money in them Poor4ever.. not too sure why you post here if you are anti-crypto?

Think about what a fork looks like.
Now imagine a two pronged fork.
When bitcoin 'forks' it turns one chain into two.
Chains meaning block chains.
The blockchain is the record of P2P transaction that occur between users, which when they reach i.e., 1MB on bitcoin, form a block.
Hence, block - chain. 
When bitcoin forks it turns into two chains, one remains the original chain aka bitcoin, the other sometimes forms a new cryptocurrency, aka Bitcoin Cash.

Yeah this is my first time essentially; dollar cost averaged during the last dip in November.

Y'all trippin' bitcoin is truly crashin'; down almost 50% now. 
Unless there's a super strong support in the form of people that did not buy on mania and for a mid-term pump and dump, this is a real problem.

"These coins will moon"? If yous writin dis stuff, plx fix the quote.

Sounds like a silly idea.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:44:51
Yus. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:03:47
I mean.. it's still up $10,000-$11,000 from November.. so can't really be complaining.
Also, looked into it a bit and BTC makes about 25%-30% corrections every time it spikes to an all-time high the last three times.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:33:36
Yeah.. looks like we're legit reliving the November pump and dump mania.

This is very true. Lotta us just talking about how much money we're going to make off of bitcoin. If we are in it for that, we shouldn't be in it at all.
This is extreme but it's based on the premise that bitcoin wasn't initially created for people to make massive returns, it was created as an alternative to centralized fiat currencies. 
Therefore, a focus on technology in the community will create a much stronger foundation of supporters rather than fickle buyers who are looking for a quick buck; they buy in and pull out at the drop of a hat. They are what create bubbles. They are what create the downfall of things that have great potential.
Thanks for posting this, very informative.

Look at how these 'police' are dressed.. looks like a dollar costume from a pop-up Halloween store.
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:08:38
Why it's true. Just go look at the bcash forums. Endless threads trying to take down bitcoin. This video is actually the perfect analogy for it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:49:46
Of course you would.

Ye it's an echo chamber.
Bitcoin at .02 on the dollar!
Buy more! Bull run inc!

So fcking fcked up. Fck the Banks, honestly you can't just erase the competition on something so fundamental as currency, such things should be illegal. 
You're not allowed to discriminate against customers anywhere else.. laws need to force banks to accept crypto as laws are meant to reflect the norms and values of society, at least when it comes to civil or case law (financially related).

Sell the data to law enforcement , a govt agency. That sounds corrupt as fuck.
