Now I do see where you are coming from. You do regret selling them but you don't regret supported the loved one. You would have nearly a million dollars right now if you didn't sell. But family first 
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:22:03
They charge you an extra 25 cents for every dollar you spend tho. It is kinda ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:23:22
Yes or early in early adopters 
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:31:02
Why
