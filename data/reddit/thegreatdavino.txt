All these good comments on here!  Maybe this is how the Earth economy in the Star Trek universe got started!

Broader than that i guess. Do you keep track of each coin's cost? Can you choose which coins to sell or trade? 
For instance, if I have accumulated the following:
0.05BTC  
0.10BTC  
0.03BTC  
So i would have spent about 180USD accumulating these coins, but at today's exchange rate i'll take a loss if i sell or use the 0.03BTC and will have gains if i sell or use the 0.05BTC.
Does it really matter? Should i just average them and consider that my overall cost? 
I guess what would be helpful is to hear how other bitcoin users manage their purchasing, investing, and spending.

A fuck ton. It's fun though! So many new posts and activity throughout. 
I'm enjoying the roller coaster ride.

I hope is jinx'd... i got started about three weeks ago and took forever to get my funds going in Gemini (not their fault). By the time i was ready to buy substantial quantities this shit happened!
Get low so i can buy goddammit!

i can't find a good meme, but it feels so quiet... everyone waiting on pins and needles for a BCC block... hardly any blockchain volume... Halfway between BizzaroWorld and Dorthy in Wizard of Oz.

I'm a HODL'r but I had $150 in an exchange that I hadn't purchased with because the price was too high for me.
I saw the gradual daily rise so I bought this morning, rode the wave, and sold just a little bit ago; made $2.70!
HODL'ing is better IMO but this was a fun ride!

I mean... I was kinda thinking the same thing.  It's one of the beauties of bitcoin; being able to transfer between wallets at little cost.  
Good job on the write up though!  That's one of the other beauties of bitcoin;  a platform to learn something practical and new.

yeah... me too; this morning. Dollar cost averaging though, so i got that going for me, which is nice.

Dude... I commented this five hours ago and only got 2 karma.  Wtf

I saw that article this morning too... didn't think much of it other than to watch things more closely after the summer.
Now i realize that LOTS of people saw that article this morning and i wonder if they sold today because of it too. Is that the 'correction' we saw a little bit ago?
Maybe not FUD, but still interesting.

I love Gemini, but they're slow as balls when it comes to signing up/approving new accounts. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:32:47
i thought it was interesting to read on here earlier today that a big portion of traders would have set auto-sell flags in their respective exchanges when/if the price hit 3000USD.

howso? I've been using them for almost a year and they've never let me down.
