If you can substitute "you are" then it's "you're", so yes, you're right.

Neat. I appreciate you taking the time to type all of that out. Would you mind if I popped in here and asked you more questions if something else comes up that I can't seem to get the full grasp of?

Thanks for the info. Where do fees come in when transferring from my paper wallet to my CoinSpace wallet, if there are any? I don't understand how that works either. Also, when I sent coins from Coinbase to my CoinSpace wallet the Receive wallet address in CoinSpace changed. Does that happen after every transaction?

How do you move BTC from Coinbase to a paper wallet? Can you go the other way too?

Thank you :)

Will my balance on GDAX change in accordance to how much money I have in my USD wallet on Coinbase? If so, when I buy Bitcoin on GDAX with my USD wallet money will it show up in the Coinbase app?

Do you have any idea of what the fees normally are?

I signed in on GDAX using my Coinbase credentials and now have a USD wallet of which I started a transfer to of $25. Says it'll take 6 days. Whatever Bitcoins I buy can be used with the USD wallet funds once they transfer and I will incur $0 to very low fees in comparison to the $2 each time I bought Bitcoins beforehand now if I'm understanding this. Is that correct?

It costs nothing to move it to GDAX and also costs nothing to move it from GDAX to your own wallet.

I'm using CoinSpace as my wallet. I don't see anywhere in the settings (that are virtually non-existent) to change the priority of a transfer. How does that work when transferring coins from my own paper wallet to CoinSpace or vice versa? Is there still a fee?

Awesome. What happens if I try to send LTC to a BTC wallet? Does it just fail and the LTC stay where they were? Does it automatically convert instead?

So.... I've got a paper wallet and I don't understand how to get what I have in there to a Bitcoin bank like Copay. Isn't that the only way to "cash out" (take them from coins to actual USD)? There's probably some fundamental thing I'm not understanding and I apologize in advance if the questions don't make sense due to that.

Yeah, that's the boat I'm in. Paid $4.25ish to transfer $1 just to see how it all works. I am not a smart man.

Will there be fees transferring what's now in my CoinSpace wallet to a wallet I have on Mycellium? How's fees determined between transfers of my own wallets? The same way as you linked above minus the differences between priorities I can set with Mycellium?

Just trying to understand how things work is all. I don't see anywhere in Copay to import the private key. When I click "Receive" I get a key generated for/by my Copay account, I presume, and I don't get how to send the paper wallet coins to the Copay account. If I don't need to do that to exchange the coins in the paper wallet to USD, I really just would like to know how to add coins from Copay to the paper wallet. When clicking "Send" in Copay I'm presented with "Buy Bitcoin" or "Show address" which just shows the same thing as the "Receive" tab.
Also, I have EasyMiner going at home and during setup I gave it the Public Key to my paper wallet. Do you know whether or not whatever I mine will just be automatically added to the paper wallet?
