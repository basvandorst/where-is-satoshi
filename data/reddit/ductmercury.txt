Happens, but I don't like Kraken that much. Bitfinex fit's my needs perfectly since I trade ETH usually.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:55:25
I did use Bitfinex for bitcoin earlier, but now it's more worth to trade alt coins more often than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:47:48
Bitfinex is changing the game now, worth trading with them.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:17:55
Bitfinex is really stepping up the game.
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:17:10
I'd split into 30% BTC, 40% ETH and 30% in other small coins. I do use my BTC to trade altcoins on Bitfinex during the market low's and high's.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:31:01
I'm dead
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:06:41
Still holding some on Bitfinex, hope you are right xd.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:43:16
Yep, with the Bitcoin price jumping up and down I do get some nice profits day-trading on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:53:54
Why didn't you research a bit before deciding to go with Bittrex, next time don't go just after the popularity? You can see how many issues and "scam reports" are around here regarding Bittrex. Try out other trading platforms, Bitfinex for example, never had any issue with them and their support is on point.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:58:40
To be honest, Bitfinex knows what they are doing so don't FUD people around, I'm becoming a bit sick of all the people speculating about USDT.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:52:42
Mostly not good news for the crypto market. But I doubt it will, Bitfinex has a high supply and daily trading volume, so they definitively know what they are doing with tether.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:04:34
Bought some BTC on Bitfinex during the last dip, still holding on because I believe it will overcome this bad time.
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:34:12
Slowly going away, people see that Bitfinex is working as usual so there is no need to be scared or panic. Check the volume on Bitfinex right now: 
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:21:38
Or wait 4 more days and register with Bitfinex, trading with them for a time now, more than happy.
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:11:09
Nice video, good job.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:32:57
Bitcoin is a 10 year HODL
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:06:25
Just a paid article with no sources. I'll stick to trading on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:32:24
That's why I prefer Bitfinex right now, it's shaking everything up by adding new coins, changes and features.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:01:32
Yea Bitcoin is still dominating the scene.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:03:38
Yes indeed, only if they want to earns trillions xd. Bitfinex knows what they are doing so good luck to them.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:33:59
Hope this is true, still holding some one Bitfinex ready to sell when it reaches 20k again.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:16:24
Nice meme indeed, but to be honest I'm afraid to leave my BTC in Bitfinex, never had a problem with them and their support is pretty fast, patience is the key.
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:28:14
Personally, since I trade on Bitfinex I know they opened registrations for new users.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:19:36
Well said.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:47:09
There is nothing to worry about, I have been trading for a long time and we have seen several attacks like this before but the price always goes up.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:22:37
You violated their TOS, best thing would be to contact their support and see what they can do for you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:01:28
Obviously Bitcoin but if you do trades usually and like to try new things then you could also check BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:52:10
Temporary solutions are temporary, something permanent would be appreciated.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:26:49
It's not yet time for bull trap, maybe wait a few more years.

Happy Block 500,000
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:53:32
Usually if the fees are high then transaction speed is also fast but can't really tell right now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:00:10
I hope this is true.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:48:44
As expected lol.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:42:59
I do believe it will go up, but I believe more in ETH potential. I've been stocking Ethereum on Bitfinex since the second dip.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:34:55
You have to elaborate a bit more on which exchange, what time, how etc.
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:59:29
I got mindblown, Imagine the possibilities of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:38:22
Most of the people sell for fiat when they reach a satisfying point. Those people who sold at 15k - 19k are the smartest, everyone knows that when something is overhyped sure that growth won't continue. I used to deal with BTC whenit was sub 1000$ buying and selling on Bitfinex every 10%-15% change. Now, this price of 10,000$ it's just too much to deal with. Switch to Ethereum and mostly buying it cheap on Bitfinex and selling for a 15% rate on different forums.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:35:09
Saying it like being a millionaire is bad --__--
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:47:05
Imagine someone who makes a lot of transactions, maybe he has learned his wallet completely.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:32:00
I seem's that 90% of people here are just praying that prices will go up while holding their coins. In the meantime, I'm enjoying making small trades during the drops and selling on a 5%-10% rise. Easily done with Ethereum on Bitfinex, since there are many buy walls right after a gain.
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:00:50
I doubt it also, Bitcoin was on social media all around the world, newspapers, evening news and everywhere. That's where all the people jumped on board at once. Bitfinex might have played a small role since most of the big traders do trade there so that might have had a small impact on the price. Now people buying Bitcoin when it rose up from 4k to 19k, they are the real pumpers.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:41:26
If you want I can buy it with PayPal, 20$ is too much of a hassle signing up for an exchange, verifying, waiting etc.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:43:37
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:36:04
Can you explain it to me, if you say you can create a wallet in 2 minutes, does that mean that there are a lot of abandoned wallet, so the "adoption" number is even lower?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:09:56
I'm buying now 3 dips in a row on Bitfinex, I can already see my Lambo delivery.
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:41:13
And I got trolled every time I said someone that I trade on Bitfinex. But the golden rule of trading is not to keep your money or coins on exchanges when you don't need to.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:47:21
That's great news. I remember my first time I payed in crypto, was completely dazzled. Now it has become a daily thing. Buy some ETH on Bitfinex, send it to my wallet, go around the forums and purchase services and stuff, pay with Ethereum, but most of the times every payment feels a bit like the first time, amazed by just being you and the seller, not a third party in between.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:48:18
Why would you say Bitfinex has liquidity issues, they have quite a large daily volume.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:03:36
Yea, that was mentioned. Bitfinex got subpoenaed about the hack that happened earlier and the investigations are ongoing.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:49:03
I bought the second dip on Bitfinex, thinking that it will go higher. Holding since then and yet I'm not in profit so I think you miss patience. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:53:55
It over $8k again, just checked on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:18:13
Depends on the amount, for large amounts I use Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:59:47
If you are a big trader you can use major exchanges like Bitfinex, but if you do want to buy small amounts, you can wander around forums or small sites that offer this service.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:38:57
Yes, exactly. And they dare to complain that the millennials are the poorest generation.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:34:02
Great, that my country does not have taxes on crypto yet. Come and live with me guys, 500$ a month for a living address xD
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:27:06
Well, that can be true or not, it's not under Bitfinex control. I heard quite a lot of people use this trading bots and the profits are pretty good, but I'm not willing to risk my account there.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:36:54
If you are looking for an exchange to make some real trading, Bitfinex is for you. As I can see you have the budget, you can have a look around. Also, I don't know which pair you use mainly or what coin, but let me say that their Ethereum transactions are the fastest.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:46:45
Do you earn something by doing this?
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:10:43
Troll level over 9999
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:37:21
Referral fee xD
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:45:01
Like the guy who sold 1700 BTC at 0.30$ and then regretted it when the price got at 8$. Now its 10,000$.
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:44:29
Well sorry if I sound like a complete retard, this is supposed to be AMA, so I hope you would clear it out for me.
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:36:30
People jumped on it once it broke 9k so this is normal.
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:13:19
Yes OP, you see, you didn't have 1 BTC, you maybe had 0.0000345678 BTC worth 0.30$, so 1 BTC went up from 800$ to 20.000$ then your 0.0000345678 BTC will raise in the same percentage as 800$ to 20.000$ = 2400%
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:10:03
Can this be rich people selling some stock to get into crypto while cheap?
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:02:00
Would like to hear more about this, also why didn't you choose to sell on exchanges?
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:42:36
I like reading the comment on that old thread. Nice find man.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:39:51
What if you go to sleep and the price drops to 0. You sound like you are a stock trader xD, this is different cowboy.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:24:13
Please notify us when you open it. Curious to see how much you find.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:53:20
Damn, that's some Inception shit right there.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:49:26
As far as I know, Bitfinex does it right now. You can try it out.
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:40:14
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:46:04
It feels like deja-vu. Crypto is driving us all crazy.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:51:55
You can tell them to send it as friend &amp; family, that way they can chargeback, not through PayPal at least. He would have to go to his bank, tell them it was an unauthorised transaction, but that's too much to deal with.
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:00:27
Depends on the amount you want to invest. I personally use Bitfinex, now it's a bit harder to get in, but worth it if you plan to do some serious trading.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:33:57
No problem, hope you solved your problem.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:48:18
Can you elaborate more about this?
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:01:15
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:13:07
That should be an exchange account or some sort of a company, no person would leave it in one place.
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:38:19
Well, this is the main theory of people who spread FUD against Tether/Bitfinex and yet when it comes to something that might prove it's wrong those same people tend to ignore it. Glad I didn't fall for any of these FUD campaigns.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:55:24
He doesn't get that he got rich with "late investors" money, while those "late investors" lost money. Fucking kid is so retarded, if it would just buy and hold, then all would be rich. Props go to people who trade crypto, those who pay in crypto and to his grandma that buy's BTC at $19k.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:11:05
What about ETH, no one is excited about Ethereum :(
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:44:06
I'd like to hear more about this if you can provide more???
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:14:50
I will check again when you make a logical thread about tether and it affecting the market. Might judge buy your way of thinking xD
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:52:01
If that 50$ doesn't mean much to you, I'd recommend just keep buying weekly or biweekly and stack it up for the future. I've been doing this is BTC in the past, now I'm stacking Ethereum and EOS by buying biweekly on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:54:29
I do arbitrages sometimes, but mainly I use Bitfinex for exchanging ethereum.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:34:53
Pretty nice.
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:33:44
You will have the opportunity again, I think we will have a "small correction" as people say for this, since the growth is going slowly up and down every time.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:04:06
It's the same thing with Bitfinex and Tether, big players are running the game here, so don't be fooled by the FUD.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:17:14
What about market volatily, so you get paid 2000$ on midnight, when you wake up in the morning price drops and you have 1900$. I'm just saying, is there a solution to this? Also I know that it can happen the opposite, but no one would take the first option.
Also I do get paid in Ethereum and do know the pain when my employee tell me he sent ex. 500$ on my wallet, when I log in I see 480$ xd.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:21:10
I like it when I learn new words in English, since it's not my first language. Had to google the word quasi-anonymous. 
"Sites such as Chatroulette, Omegle, and Tinder (which pair up random users for a conversation) capitalized on a fascination with anonymity. Apps like Yik Yak, Secret and Whisper let people share things anonymously or quasi-anonymously whereas Random lets the user to explore the web anonymously."
And on topic, that's not strange most of the people are afraid to even tell their real name or country where they live even on a long run. I had a friend with whom I play quite often for a year now and yet I only do know him from his gaming nick, privacy freak xd, but I don't mind it.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:48:11
The safest it is holding them in your offline wallet. I keep coins on Bitfinex only if I need to do a trade or make an urgent exchange else everything backed up on my wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:49:48
You need to put your scuba gear on man.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:56:32
I do get paid in Ethereum by my employer and usually exchange it on Bitfinex for cash or different forums at a 15% rate, to make a bit more profit.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:56:13
This might be FUD, but I don't really believe that this caused the dip today or the current dipping spree. To be honest I still can't seem to find a strong reason of what happened today.
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:09:43
Well no exactly on topic, but If would be one of those guys who bought 20$ of weed with like 20 BTC, I'd just jump of a bridge xd.
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:35:16
It's a 50/50 man, so don't brag about "predicting 9k", predict that Ethereum is going to reach 2500$, since that's what I'm stacking up.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:34:16
It's a bit different comparing people who saw that Bitcoin price is rising and investing in hope of making big money and those people who investing by believing in the technology. To be honest you must call OG's people who used Bitcoin to buy drugs on dark weeb :)
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:32:46
How can a family with less than 30k a year get back 10k? I'm not from the US so please explain this to me.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:40:30
Why should we, people who made these rules missed out the train so they try to squeeze us?
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:37:45
Coinbase trying to get out of this shit, great management you got there.
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:14:37
Have you tried writing on their Reddit, there is support that might speed up your case:
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:35:50
How is the "refilling" process, do you have to manually load BTC on them or through a software from your PC?
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:03:46
Becuase that's one of the best FUD theories ever heard and it has been just proven wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:38:12
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:33:02
Thanks for the notice. I trade on a forum regularly, usually, I sell BTC and ETH I buy on Bitfinex or which I receive from my online shop. But since I once was on his age, I wanted to be kind to him to offer to buy those 20$ BTC for 20$ PayPal, 1:1 ratio, which normally I don't do since I apply a 15% for BTC and ETH I sell.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:47:38
find*, found is for the past.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:40:10
Nice article, I really enjoyed reading your analysis. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:51:11
 I was expecting a Bitfinex review? Any reason why you excluded or did you want to leave only the easiest of the easiest ways?
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:45:06
Just my two cents man.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:38:03
It's calm because we have been traumatized by greater dips, so this is just another day in the office for most of us.
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:03:58
Really interested to hear about this. I've been trading on Bitfinex for more than a year now and never had any money missing. Can you confirm what you are saying?
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:26:36
What about the fees, are they high or something?
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:52:35
People trust him because he's one genius guy who never disappoints you.
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:36:26
And who is installing those ATMs?
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:57:13
But they are still able to use Localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:55:28
Hope he's not thinking of bringing another dip lol.
