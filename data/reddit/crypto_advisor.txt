Sounds like something a market manipulator would say.

Surprise! They’re using GDAX too. (I hope not)

In December it was $100k

Quite an intelligent interview. Good for her.

What a closed-minded thing to say. While not the most upstanding career, if you can earn a living, enjoy what you do, and not alienate those that love you - then why not?

This is why TA isn’t useless. The target of the descending triangle was $3Kish. Once $6K broke at least sub-$5K was in the cards.

21 is the magic number.

I still think we have another drop down to $6K before the market fully turns around.

I don’t understand why my comment makes everyone believe I’m salty because I didn’t buy the dip. I couldn’t buy the dip, I’m all in already. There’s no salt, I want this shit to succeed. We just aren’t picking up steam enough yet, and I anticipate another plummet then a bigger spike that sends things in a better trajectory.

What do you think the recent buying has been? Traders were expecting sub-$5.7K. No one was buying then, except the early ‘in the know’. 
Full disclosure: I also bought $5.7 and I know nothing so I know there are holes in my theory.

That’s what makes an ETF so important. They have to buy BTC, reducing overall supply and driving up demand and price.
