I never thought I'd say this... but I think I may be happy to be a BMO customer
@_date: 2014-06-12 05:18:02
If BMO has any brains they will hire these kids the second they graduate
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:45:57
Finally, now they just have to work on their customer service being absolute garbage

This only makes me more excited to move to The Netherlands. If you live in the region, would you mind me asking how long it would take to get from Amsterdam to den Haag?

Tis a silly place

Yet they called Mt.gox ( though indirectly ) the largest exchange, and beat that old old dead horse called criminal activity. So 10/10 for effort. 1/10 for fact checking

Lots of tech savvy people everywhere still dont know about bitcoin. 
Cases like this where hyper inflation is killing a currency provides a huge opportunity for bitcoin to grow and mature

Was coming here to post something similar, but probably not as thorough. UPVOTED!

Perfect! I've been looking for this exactly. I swear if I see another " This is a bubble" post I will go live in a cave somewhere and completely swear off being a member of society all-together.

Wow, you know a lot of a-holes.

Because people are too emotional, and keep treating BTC like a commodity, not a currency. It doesn't take much to get people to undercut each other selling BTC when they get scared they are going to lose everything.

From what I read, the author of the paper was able to find a specific problem in which a classical computer could behave like the D-wave. Certainly interesting and could turn out that the D-wave in fact not a true quantum computer, but I would hardly call this paper real evidence.

Who knows. I could be living in a cave with an internet connection as we speak
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:58:16
I re-read the article as well as some blog from some guy and I see now what you are saying. However given that many people who have far more knowledge on the subject are split on the matter, I am unable to accept that it is definitively not (likewise that is definitely IS) a quantum computer. 
AND I SWEAR this is the last post in here about this. Getting into a discussion about quantum computers in the Bitcoin subreddit. Its too interesting and just keeps sucking me back in!
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:10:27
I think this is more of a price adjustment than anything. The growth we saw before was unsustainable. I think this adjustment is going to be positive long term. And with so many people selling, there wont be so many people holding on to crazy amounts of BTC just hoping to get rich quick.  I think we will see a return to +$1000, but how long that takes is anyone's guess
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:19:29
Incorrect, the last test they did on the computer it behaved exactly as a quantum computer was predicted to. So there is no evidence to suggest that it is anything but a true quantum computer. That being said, I think it had an 8 qubit processor and still required near absolute-zero conditions to function, so needless to say it will be a while before its actually useful.
But to reference OP's question, by the time reasonably powerful quantum computers exist most if not all BTC will be already mined, the real question is what happens to the security features. A powerful quantum computer would be able to crush any password you could reasonably use to secure a wallet

This would have been an interesting post if you put it up about 24 hours ago.
So one of a couple things is happening here.
1. You're upset that you didn't get into BTC sooner and you are bitter and want to rub everyone's nose in it. In which case OP is a fag
2. You saw everyone and their grandma post about this already and decided to get some karma. In this case you're a karma whore
3. You are trying to add to the negative sentiment about BTC in the hopes you can buy a bunch of cheap ones. In which case you are a money whore
