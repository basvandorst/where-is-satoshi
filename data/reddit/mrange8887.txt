They don't make any more of it.   There are thousands of other cryptos that are also seein explosions... I would keep my land and find a different way to get into crypto

It's money against money to put down something that has no way to be stopped.... Except with giant amounts of money.   I'm curious what's going to happen... 
IMHO they shouldn't allow it, I feel it could hurt

Have you tried blockfolio? Or you just want to talk shit? It's ok if you do... Fucking volatility is addictive.

Time to buy iota... No bullshit forks and no bullshit transaction fees. Actual M2M transaction and future proof! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:31:09
Why would someone sell before the fork? 
Can someone explain to me the idea behind a fork and how its usually done? Everyone talks about it but I guess I skipped class that day.

You might wanna check your settings..  I have it to remind me constantly about a specific price in a specific coin and it won't leave me alone about it until I go back to settings and rearrange that

Curious related? A little too child like... I would like to see some of the other cryptos being thrown around... Please, for the love of God, make sure the print quality of it is good. I bought a shirt a few days ago (on eBay for an alt) it was the worst piece of crap I have ever received. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:18:59
Grab your phone rub some habanero peppers on it.   Make sure the flesh of the habanero gets smeared all over it and stick it up your fucking ass. Then start calling that number. (make sure the vibrator is on for that phone)... 
That might ease the pain you're going trough for a while but is not a permanent fix.   I'm sorry for your lost money

I'm I witnessing a major downfall of cryptocurrencies? In a few years they will be any regular stock option and be just a regular currency. I'm just not sure... Can anyone help me with this?

Walmart, Amazon, target. The problem will be the transaction fees and the time it takes for the coin to transfer. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:46:23
Is Bitcoin really really that stable? It takes a lot of power for the transaction to go trough.   Not to mention the amount of time.   And the fees! I think Bitcoin is for retirement and major purchases
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:03:04
Just give it to me bro...
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:13:02
5 Dolla here and there.  
But the fees would be like $15

@_date: 2017-11-07 03:06:29
You really have to have more money than sense doing that..
You will lose 100000 over what? A small hiccup in this universe that Bitcoin has become? Shit. I'll bet you 1000 bitcoins your shit won't do anything in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:59:00
could have made up the story and get away with the coins?... Avoid taxes and what not?

I have always wondered about that poor guy that lost his shit to Mt gox.... That was back then! I can only imagine what he's thinking right now and what his reaction would have been if that would have happened today vs. Years ago
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:44:24
Muh dick
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:43:49
Wait a few days for the fees to lower... 
If I do that I starve...or I take out more than I should and see the value of what I took out go to the moon and I just sit there, eating my fucking egroll that now costed me $30 because I don't want to be playing a wait game or get fucked because of the high fees. What if this assholes simply don't lower it?

Lol... Sure looks like it happened this way... Actually there's a shit storm brewing in the Bitcoin side... Something about manipulation.   Funny thing.   I saw a couple posts yesterday warning of the shit show that was about to happen in the next couple of days.   
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:36:23
Hey man, really quick... I have $10 on me.. should I invest in Bitcoin or should wait for the fork to happen? Any and all your help will be appreciated it.  Would $10 be enough to touch the moon or should I just put$5

You know... This actually makes a lot of sense... I would be inclined to this version if he still is living with his GF. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:24:51
That guy is so stupid... He could probably have greased the right people in there and get an idea of what sections were dumped on around those dates.   I'm sure he could have narrowed it down to at least 50% of the landfill and he could have been cashing this coins by now... Now who is going to dig trough years and literally tons of shit in this thing.

Wait and see... Is not boosting.. people is kind of smelling the coffee.   It was nice... When it was anonymous, unregulated. Now that it's half ass regulated all big dogs are working to bring it down.. it's obviously working.   
Tell me... What will bring the price up in your opinion
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:10:01
What's that?

Same thing... Can't buy bit, lit, eth.... Nada, zero squash
Can you send me that link
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:51:45
Nope... You can't blame the rich for getting in and try to defend the poor and late adopters on this one... 10000 bitcoins were given to a guy just for ordering another guy some pizza.   You think they would have given him 5 bitcoins if anyone knew it would be worth so much now day? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 00:38:58
Ok... But seriously...would you guys agree that Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies lost their appeal once they are regulated? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:09:22
You need us to buy... You actually can't keep anonymous.... It faces a nosedive once banksters and China messed with it.   I gotta say.   It still has a lot of value.   I just don't think any new adopters are willing to take such risks

@_date: 2017-09-02 17:32:38
I'm not gonna lie... I hope it crashed and digs a hole.   Then I'll buy a shit load of it for ¢10 and wait for it to reach $1000 a coin then sell it all

Dude... I can't understand why fucking China is aff crying crypto so much. . This shit is supposed to be decentralized, anonymous. Now, every announcement the government makes on it affects it terribly. What's even worst, other parts of the world are making announcements on its adoption and no one seems to bat an eye, is it China really affecting it or are we all being manipulated
