The amount of money it takes to move depends on the depth of the order book. Say if you want to know how many $ it takes to increase the price of Bitcoin by 5%, you would take the current mid price, multiply this by a factor of 1.05 and finally look in the order book exactly how many bitcoins will have to be purchased to reach the higher bitcoin price. The money it takes to move the price will thus be the sum of the bitcoins multiplied by the respective ask prices that the sell (ask) orders are placed at. In other words, you want to calculate the volume-weighted price from the mid price to the target (e.g. +5%) price.
This may be a tedious task if you consider the whole bitcoin market, as you would have to do the above calculation based on order books from several exchanges, given that BTC is traded on so many exchanges. But nonetheless an interesting factor to consider for a given cryptocurrency!

Your pool analogy is correct to the extent that market cap is linearly related to price, but it is also a function of supply. That is Market Cap = Price x Supply of bitcoin. It is definitely true that the water level falls as people take their money out, as the act of selling (if that is the current aggregate movement in the market) drives down the price, thereby reducing the market cap. The increasing supply of bitcoin from mining, while it's a factor in the calculation above, probably doesn't matter too much in the current market when the price is rising at a much faster rate than the inflationary pressure from new bitcoins being minted.
