As far as I know Lara Seiersen already made lots of millions going into bitcoin early and selling at 5k. I am unaware if he still holds some, but I wouldn't be surprised if he did.
Also this is slightly old news (about a month I believe) with the claim being from their annual "Outrageous claims" that they publish at the end of each year....

No, BCash is a fork of ZCash I believe, though it has not been released yet.

I love the sophisticated combination of red crayon and rum on a plutonic rock surface.

Yeah I was about to write something similar at the end of my post but decided against it as it is probably on the edge of being too speculative, but yes if you have the money to buy a substantial amount of BTC now, you could definitely do this to influence the price in the time up to the expiration of the future.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:37:23
As far as I understood the futures are settled in dollars so basically they are just gambling on the price at a certain time in the future? In that case you don't need to hold any bitcoin to do futures.

Pornhub for when the pressure builds up inside you from watching BTC going up and down, and you need to vent that pressure for 30 secs (no longer - something could be happening on gdax!!)

You could retitle this as "Fywq's first day in bitcoin" after buying in at the top of 7.500 and seeing it slide to 6000. It never went quite as bad though because the 150kk mempool forced a 72 hour wait on me before the coins even arrived where I could sell them. Thanks for making me hodl mempool.

Well with the high minimum limit on payout to external wallet they were sure to build up a lot of BTC in unpaid + those that used their wallet instead. Fairly decent tactics for an inside job if that is what it is, and not using a cold wallet seems ridiculous.
i only had around 0.002 BTC sitting there, 0.001 from first automatic payout to NH wallet, and almost another payout too. Couldn't withdraw the first payout as minimum to transact to external wallet was 0.0019 or something. Clever setup.
In the end most of us probably only lost a bit on the electricity bill, but still sucks donkey ass to lose that time and effort
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:24:35
Right now it is rising so fast even a 75% crash might still leave us better off than a month ago :O

And while this will probably get deleted thus underlining my point: The difference is on one sub disagreeing posts are deleted, whereas on the other they are downvoted to oblivion. Both solutions work counter to the concept of free, decentralized discussion, which I would argue should be a core value of  bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:06:25
Interesting hadn't heard about that before. Thanks

Welcome to the club - At least your fee is 100sat/B higher than mine so should process eventually (300ish vs. 190ish). I have been waiting for something like 72 hours and with the increase in backlog again it will easily be another 72 hours...
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:27:35
I totally panicked, but thanks to the congestion on transactions I didn't get to do anything other than move my BTC to an exchange. And they are still underway after I sent them almost 72 hours ago. I guess even when I wan't to sell I hodl. This is what I have become now.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:58:14
So forgive me for still (after reading the links) not getting it completely. Will this only affect holders of USDT and maybe users of Bitfinex, or also just BTC holders in general? As I see it if this comes crashing down a lot of BTC will have been bought for USDT, and those that accepted USDT will be screwed, while those that hold BTC will be fine. But it will remove a lot of purchasing power from BTC and could potentially impact the price. On the other hand even 615 million is not that much compared to a marketcap of 100-120 billion for BTC, so would probably at most create some big waves but nothing permanent. Please enlighten me further no matter if I am right or wrong. Still a newbie hodler...
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:58:40
I am but a newbie but right now I pretty much understand it the same as you. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:23:32
Yeah I think this will pretty much ensure LTC is here to stay. Strongly consider buying into that as well for diversification...

Have a widget for both USD and EUR on my phone for this exact reason - Want to take part in the hype, but EUR is not there yet...

Isn't that sort of what we all want to avoid with bitcoin? Also the thing is fractional reserve in a world economy worth trillions is one thing. Potentially raising marketcap 10x on a crypto is something else entirely. As long as it works out it works out, If it crashes it may drag all of us down, even those without tether, as the value of BTC and other cryptos are suddenly dropping.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:12:57
Same. Won't buy them. What I am concerned about is if the tethers have artificially inflated the BTC price and supported it in dips (like the last week seems to show), then I could see BTC crash really hard back. They won't be lost though and over the years the value should go up again. That is the nature of BTC. But I still see how this could lead to a monster crash in a worst case scenario.

Over 10.000 on christmas - Would be a nice gift.

Depends where. Cryos semen bank in Denmark (worlds biggest supplier afaik) pays up to 80 USD per load of quality semen once you are accepted.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:41:03
The thing is 600M worth of buying bitcoins is enough to push up the price, or create support when it is dropping (like it seems to have done especially over the last week or so). If all of a sudden tether is exposed as having no value, then that support for BTC may disappear leading to a crash. How big is really hard to predict, but depending of exposure in the media of the alleged fraud it could cause a massive self-reinforcing crash on panic and fear
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:12:05
Bought in about a week ago, too afraid to lose out on the ride to the moon. This is exactly how I feel. Getting pretty concerned about not even being able to do transactions anymore too. Luckily I started out light and only put in a few 100 USD
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:16:23
Well we can only hope..... Though I would like it to take another dip first so I can get some more :D
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:58:21
To be honest, from time to time a lot of the post on this sub are about the other sub or bashing BCH as well. It goes both ways and all in all probably harms both communities.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:40:12
Coinbase have the same warning now:




As others mention the backlog is dropping and hopefully by tomorrow this will all be in the past.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:30:20
At the moment the fees for even BTC transactions seem to be through the roof. Nothing is done for free, not in Fiat, not in BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:56:45
Yeah I read and read. Hope all will be fine with the EDA. But buying in and then 2 hours later reading about S2X and then barely after that comes this. Sure is a rollercoaster to be a HODLer...
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:17:29
Well that was sort of the whole point of the issue over the weekend. You could always put up transactions for fees like this but due to the mempool filling up the low fee transactions were not processed and as a results people posted higher and higher custom fees to accelerate their own transactions and that in turn made the low fee transactions take even longer. Also it has improved dramatically over the last couple of days.
Just to give you an example I waited for around 72 hours before my 191sat/B transaction went through over the weekend. If I had paid that fee now it would have processed in minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:49:36
Right now it seems transactions are going up even though BTC has 90%+ of the hashing power. It can take a looooong time before we see our coins.
