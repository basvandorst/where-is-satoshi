This feels like blatant manipulation.  This like amateur OTC markets stuff.  Tread carefully.

It's actually true somewhat.  I remember in 2013 getting out at $400 (only mined, never bought w/cash) and then thinking it was at it's absolute peak at $1000.  My only gripe is that it's pure speculation and subject to the same sort of shenanigans that happened in OTC Markets so there is a good chance it may drop.  That and it's future is uncertain with governments giving it a hard time in some places.
But to those who made money congrats and I hope your profits are even better!  I'd get back into mining but it's a bit more complicated than just setting up a spare laptop to mine anymore.

For anyone looking to get into bitcoin, buy it individually if you want to pay cash for them; the bitcoin mutual fund things are scams.  Mining isn't really feasible for an individual unless you're in a collective mining scheme of some sort.  In the past you could actually mine yourself but it requires too much processing power now.  If you do mine try to find a way to set it up somewhere where you don't have to pay for electricity; in the old days it was either setting it up at work or uni office or putting a ton of mining pcs into a trailer and sucking up electricity at a campsite w/power.

These people weren't buying them, they were mining them when you could do so easily on a basic laptop.  Back then nobody even knew what they were aside from a few nerds and little caesar's pizza.
