I own a measly 0.2 BTC. However, if BTC one day skyrockets to 100k or 500k or even the crazy height of 1 million, I'll be happy.
My average buy price is about 7200€ / BTC
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:56:30
But its not rising atm. Perhaps time time buy a bit more
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:02:48
But Im Yuropean
@_date: 2019-07-03 10:52:13
I have mostly BTC, a bit of LTC and some Cardano too. But That's like 20% of my portfolio. Over 60% is BTC
@_date: 2019-07-25 12:48:28
1.000.000 BTC confirmed. IM GONNA BE RIIIIIIIICH
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:57:44
I'm reading articles on BTC news sites and apparently, analysts say that BTC is nearing a "golden cross" whatever that may mean and the last time this happened, it kickstarted the raise of BTC from 1000 to 20k so... I guess we can say there's still hope.
Though I take all of this shit with a grain of salt. Because the bullrun has often been predicted to start "aaaaany time now" yet here we are so... I dunno what to think of BTC. I think the best thing I can do, it just hold the bitcoin I have. Bought it at an average price of 7100€ per BTC.
I'm also curious to see what May's halving will do to the whole Crypto market. I understand so little about this that the only thing I understand, is that it should push the price upwards.
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:35:37
I need to uninstall coin market app and stop reading on bitcoin every day. I should just hold it and leave it be for at least 6 months.
Checking every day is not good for my anxiety
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:02:10
On a serious note guys, I know it's impossible to predict and I know too little about BTC to understand the halvening, but can the halvening really bump the price up so massively as all these analysts say, despite the rather poor performance of the past few weeks?
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:02:16
Though BTC is back on track and doing much better than a year ago I still think McAfee will have to end up eating his dick on TV. BTC will rise but I dont see it rising that high so fast.
@_date: 2019-08-11 11:55:50
Shit man if BTC went up even 50 a day Id be ecstasic lol.
People really ought to zoom the fuck out on the chart and see where we come from.
I admit BTC getting really close to dipping back at 4 digits in Euro kinda has a scaring effect but logically I know its purely psychological. Im still very confident in it.
@_date: 2019-08-15 21:54:54
Ah green numbers. Arent you a sight I love to see
@_date: 2019-08-22 12:56:28
Our resident troll rememmberywhatshisname has spoken again right? LOL
@_date: 2019-08-08 09:56:21
I bought a bunch of XLM a year ago. Thought it was promising. It failed to deliver so I decided just yesterday to dump it and buy more BTC with it instead. Made a loss, but better to cut now than to wait till it's entirely dead.
@_date: 2019-08-11 11:21:15
So many ppl around me say its too late for BTC. They might be right, but probably arent.
My average BTC buy price is about 7300€ and I dont have a full BTC but Im rather optimistic about making gaing because the technology is too solid ro just disappear IMO
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:26:40
I've read that silver is a fairly safe investment too. Not to get rich quick, but as a safe haven. Should look into it beside Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-14 07:45:58
Don't worry too much. Violent fluctuations happen fairly often. If you're in for long term, you need to be patient and do yourself the huge fucking favor to not check the rates every day.
@_date: 2019-08-08 07:46:40
What good is that to me, who is European X-D
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:00:12
BTC and to a lesser extent, ETH yes. The rest... Not sure.
@_date: 2019-08-12 23:27:33
So I told a friend of mine I invested in some BTC in March. He said BTC is just air so I replied it tripled in value since then. 
He said I should sell then.
How about no :-)
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:41:53
Yea and besides I don't give a shit if it takes weeks to go above 12k again. I'm holding long term anyway so yeah :)
@_date: 2019-10-13 18:03:17
I dont even have half a BTC. If in 5 years it can yield 20k in Euros I still see it as a win
@_date: 2019-08-09 06:26:09
@_date: 2019-08-14 08:28:52
I would say that the crypto market is one of the most volatile there is when it comes to investing. I try not to check the price too often. Better for my fucking sanity :-)
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:35:44
Shit man... I have to admit your sarcasm went right over my head. I tip my hat to you sir :)
@_date: 2019-08-10 16:47:18
Why are people panicking? Fuck man look at where bitcoin was two weeks ago. Or one year ago.
@_date: 2019-08-22 12:54:46
I've heard this bullshit like 5 times these past few months.
@_date: 2019-08-14 07:45:17
Ahead of you here in € matey.
@_date: 2019-10-17 09:38:51
I would gladly bring the guillotine back for child abusers
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:42:35
Guys, just reassure me... if my aim is not to trade short term, I should stop checking Bitcoins price every day, I should stop reading news about it every day and I should just forget about it for a while so I don't get needlessly worried all the time, correct?
@_date: 2019-08-11 11:23:38
I see alot of Altcoin holders claim BTC wont go much beyond its ATH because of scalability issues. Could someone ELI5 what this means and if these fears are unfounded?
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:42:09
I try to buy a bit of BTC every month.
@_date: 2019-06-04 08:38:17
Also, if you're in for long term, you have no business in checking the BTC price every fucking day.
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:37:00
I need to remind myself that if I'm a long term holder, I have no business in checking the BTC price several times a day.
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:14:08
I can't believe so many people got baited by your copypasta. I thought most people knew this meme by now
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:13:15
One of the really few if not only versions of Rick that was kind-hearted.
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:39:27
Take coinmarketcap, zoom the graphic out, problem solved!
@_date: 2019-12-14 22:23:43
Time to accumulate during this dip? Im still curious to hear you guys' take: the halving is something we're supposed to look forward to. But BTC really isnt doing so well. You think this is just a "bump in the road"?
@_date: 2019-12-12 19:31:13
BTC is bearish lately but everyone says tha halving in may will skyrocket the price. I IS CONFUSED.
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:24:20
Agreed but still... Considering the peak we had a few months ago...
Its just that I expected more positivity and optimism because of the halving yet all is doom and gloom on crypto news sites.
@_date: 2019-04-18 11:54:20
I kinda missed the train when it soared to near 20k in 2017. So... I just bought some BTC during the bear market when it was lower again.
Let us see if it will turn out to be a good long term investment.
@_date: 2019-09-02 07:55:38
ELI5 if this is good or bad and if good, why, please?
@_date: 2019-09-30 06:40:05
I think he means that now, in 2019 it's a relatively low price compared to what most Bitcoin holders agree will be the price in, say, 5 years.
Something along those lines
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:00:56
Analysts on NewsBTC are claiming next week could be a do or die scenario for Crypto in general. So does this mean there is actually a chance that Bitcoin will totally crash next week? Can it ever recover? Shit man crypto is nerve-wrecking. I should just buy, HODL and stay away from all these news sites for a year.
@_date: 2019-09-14 13:12:44
ELI5 why if they ban Libra, why not Bitcoin? I support bitcoin and dont want to see it banned obviously but Im curiou about why they'd ban one but leave the other.
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:04:45
Of course I dont, but still, knowing if your investment might actually make you a lot of money in 5 years or make no money at all is a life-changing thing. Worst case, I lost my investment and I can live with it. Best case, I can entirely pay of my house in the blink of an eye and I'd still have plenty of cash remaining. Even if nothing "bad" would happen to my finances in the worst case, the difference between the worst and best case are significant enough to be nervous about this
@_date: 2019-09-05 09:37:05
... this is a smart move actually
@_date: 2019-09-30 09:55:48
I didn't tell my friends because I just can't be arsed to try and change their mind, which won't work anyway.
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:42:30
I don't even understand why this is happening and in how much shit we are or aren't because I don't actually know so much about this.
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:34:29
I can't. I live in Yurop and we have no dollar.
@_date: 2019-09-10 06:57:44
I did invest some in a few altcoins just out of curiosity to see where it goes. But 80% of my portfolio is Bitcoin. I remember dumping my Stellar a couple of months ago and buy Bitcoin with it.
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:29:37
I get my paycheck today and I've been thinking about buying some more, but every time I hear "buy dat dip and hodl" I can't help but notice that 90% of the time we're in a dip anyway.
Don't mind me, I'm a born pessimist and I guess it does make me a bit anxious.
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:24:59
I fomo'd on BTC hard when it was around €12k. I've been buying again during the bear market effectively reducing my average buying price to €7300.
The day BTC rises above that again, will be the day I'll be making profit again. On that day, I'll come here and bro-fist you all!
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:59:13
Smash the beetles! Smash'em! Khuu khuu
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:45:38
I like to tell them to zoom out, see BTC has risen when looking at a longer scale, problem solved!
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:59:19
They're just pissed because they want a piece of it too.
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:32:27
I dont deny that.
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:55:22
No amount of situps will give you a six pack if theres fat covering it bro.
But still a healthy habit :-)
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:23:00
Not yet in Euros my friend
@_date: 2019-05-10 11:16:52
Can you afford to lose those savings? If yes, go ahead. If no, I would advise against it. I'm a believer of BTC and I think it'll keep going up on the long term, but the golden rule is still not to invest money you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:10:04
In case you wonder, the sign reads: "Here, I buy Bitcoins!"
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:51:19
7285 euro... Come on BTC keep going. At 7334 euro, Ill be break even.
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:21:31
Thanks! I fomo'd in hard when it was at 12k I think back in 2017. Been lowering my average by buying more during the bear market
