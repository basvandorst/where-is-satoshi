I tried this and now my computer recognizes the GPU as a usable graphics card and I have more configuration options but GPUz still says no OpenCL support. I feel like it's a driver conflict between NVIDIA and ATI. Any other ideas? Thanks.

Also quick question. Was your 5850 recognized as OpenCL before you used the dummy plug? Because mine is not recognized by GPUz as OpenCL capable.

Hey thanks for all your help. I found the solution to the driver issue I will post here if anyone needs it for further reference.




1) Install NVIDIA Drivers. This will make an OpenCL.DLL in Windows\System32 and Windows\SysWOW64.
2) Install Latest ATI Drivers (the 9.12 hotfix)
** RENAME OpenCL.DLL in Windows\System32 and Windows\SysWOW64 to something else -- OpenCL_nv.DLL for &gt;example (requires administrator priviledges) **
3) Install the ATI Stream SDK 2.0.1 (the one from the 2.0.0 "ICD" didn't work with NVIDIA for me, and it didn't install into the System folder)

Ok so you are saying all I need to do is make the computer think the card is active when it really isn't?
