Oh yea. At the time  was ~1327 at the ATM and the BTC average was ~1230. So 7% markup. Up to 800 just needs SMS verify. After that ID verified upto 3k.

It's a one way and even though it is more expensive than other methods, that convenience factor will be nice. The one in Midtown is in a Shell 967 Linden Ave. The website says it's a 9.3% over the average, so my ticker must be off a little from the average they use.

You can always download the files and put them into the folder before running. It will speed up the SYNC if done properly.

What's the potential loss in your plan? How much interest will be payed back into the loan and what are your fees for the loan? If you can justify the loan with a gain in BTC, then go for it. I would say that a loan for any investment is a bad financial choice, but there is always an upside to the risk involved.
