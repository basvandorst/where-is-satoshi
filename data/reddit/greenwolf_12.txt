Don't believe anything the UN says is true. They are part of the global control structure that will de legitimize anything bitcoin related.

Think they did that when they pumped it then shorted it on the dump. That then shook many people out permanently and de-legitimized bitcoin saying how volatile it is. They want to keep their current system, they don't like bitcoin holders. People who like bitcoin are the ones against banks and more the libertarian type. They hate those kinds. They want the current banking control structure to continue. .

this would be wonderful if there was no leverage short selling. Thats where the manipulation comes in.

i was wondering when hollywood would get involved. Unfortunately most people are like sheep and what they'll get out of this movie is bitcoin is bad and used for money laundering and nefarious activity. Basically the same thing the higher ups have been preaching about it. This will further discredit it which is their ultimate goal.

Don't get your hopes up people, anything/anyone connected to government never ever bodes well to the average joe.

i think they want to ban mining and if thats the case it would be uber bullish... no longer would we be flooded everyday by several hundred bitcoins onto the market

Well its a tiny market so who knows. I'd say the people that pumped it and dumped it before are the same people who don't want to see bitcoin succeed and label it too volatile or too risky meanwhile making money off it with their deep pockets, dumping their coins and  shorting it.

Whales control this tiny market. They maybe loaded up and went long and the little guys were shorting and got Rekt. Now, they'll reverse the position and start shorting while dumping there coins and make more money. Its simple really. Lets hope im wrong and it keeps going up but ever since leverage trading started happening, its super easy to manipulate this market. There is more incentive to short unfortunately.

before when there was no ability to short Bitcoin i'd say yes. Now with Whales pumping and DUMPING the price, i wouldn't recommend going all in.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:38:54
well now that shorting is such a huge thing i'm sure it will dump just as hard as it went up.  Sorry to be a debbie downer

Pumpers Leveraging with Long contracts.....and then soon Shorts
