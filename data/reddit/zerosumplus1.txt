Well, how do you define extreme?

From my reading of the article, I don't think that Alderney is actually proposing to adopt BTC as their currency.  They are minting BTC tokens that can be physically exchanged for the local currency but only on the island; that won't destabilise their economy and it doesn't commit them to pegging their local currency to BTC value.
Also I think more needs to be said in general about the practical applications of BTC.   As I understand it, a lot of work is going on at the moment to make BTC technology much more useful.  Colouring coins to allow for the virtual transfer of specific assets, automatic escrow and who knows how many other applications are being developed right now.  All reasons to be cheerful.

It's enough to live a normal life with a heck of a lot of comfort.

So what?

How much is the lawsuit costing you?

Well, look at it this way.
Supposing you have 1,000 BTC.  You're now a theoretical millionaire!
And suppose you're 21.  And suppose you could realistically expect to retire, assuming you have a decent pension accrued, at 65.
That's 44 working years.
That's an average salary of $22,727 per year.
Most average Joes will make at least million in their working lives, and it will still be a struggle.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that even $1m is not enough to leave normal orbit.  You will still have to work.  Just use it wisely, and don't lose sight of the ground.

Also an interesting RT interview with Patrick Murck came out today:

I was trying to make a more subtle point about the printing of fiat currency, and its archaic technology, versus Bitcoin.  I am sorry that you didn't see that.

Is it a Class Action?
