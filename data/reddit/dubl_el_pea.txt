I have no interest in scamming, and I don't want any money either. I was just hoping some technological genius might know how to help me get my money back.

I'm just all out of options man. I was planning on withdrawing the money to cover the last of my tuition this term, and I was just really hoping someone might have some idea of how to fix this. I'm sure there is one technological genius somewhere on Reddit who can help, and I just really hope he stumbles across this.

I believe that belongs to btc-e.

I'm not begging for money, and I don't want any. I have already contacted support, but have been told that there is not anything they can do. As I said, I'm just all out of options, and hoping someone knows of a solution.

Unfortunately I did not enable it, as I did not expect this to happen. Looking back, I should have definitely taken the extra precaution, but as they say, hindsight is 20/20.

El P-Dub? I'm sorry man, I think you have me mistaken for someone else.

Honestly, I'm not too sure at all. I was hoping maybe someone would have had a similar experience, and somehow have some miracle solution. I've just reached the point where I've given up all hope, and figured that no harm could be done by reaching out to Reddit and trying.

I'm sorry man, what else would you like me to provide?

Given that he is the one who accessed my account in the first place, I really doubt he's the helpful type.

There was no email verification at all. This morning I woke up and saw that the strange IP had accessed my account, and when I went to change my password, my account had been cleaned. 
It really does bother me though, that there was no email verification to confirm that is was me who was withdrawing the 2.5 BTC, especially when the site was aware that it was a foreign IP accessing the account for the first time.
