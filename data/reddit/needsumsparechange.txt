Unfortunately I have no 230 outlets but my wife's brother is a certified electrician for DuPont if need be it can be done but I do have multiple 50 amps running 120 if it gives you a idea I have both s4 miners on the same outlet and about the cost no worries about that I'm
pretty set on electric rather not explain on the forums

To make it worth it you should just buy one Bitcoin if you wanna go small that way if the market jumps it will be more worth your time of investment you might gain a hundred and loss a hundred or more in ether case it's a gamble but the odds have a good track record..

Once you click that send button she's on her way your wallet will receive it no matter what 
@_date: 2016-12-28 10:32:16
Yeah you're best bet is just to buy coin and hold on to it you'll lose more money then gain on them bullshit mining sites they are in it to make money by taking yours
