ICO lamesauce..... good way to tie up bitcoin when halving is around the corner....   Sure you will make a bit but if bitcoin does a major move... you will be the loser.
@_date: 2016-08-24 18:00:05
Keep dreaming.   The BFX hack delayed any future growth for a couple years now.

Who in their right name would trade on an exchange called POLONIEX.... let's rename it to LAGONIEX.
@_date: 2015-12-16 20:38:33
So to clarify this.... They were no longer selling to public but now will... Is this only for a batch or two or permanently going forward?  
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:35:52
Yes... Or when you pull away from the dock in your massive boat 
@_date: 2015-12-02 18:20:09
I hope they throw the book to that clown.

Is that a bad thing having a Forbes writer pro-bitcoin?

LMAO - Good one!  Sage.

@_date: 2015-12-14 17:03:07
Yeah it is getting pretty ridiculous these days.   
@_date: 2015-12-02 16:15:39
What most likely happened.  1) You downloaded some non-legit stuff on the internet (movie/game/etc) and you have your Bitcoin wallet pwd protected.   It installed a keylogger/CnC on your PC (one that does not get recognized by A/V) and you logged in after installing whatever and it captured the password.   Transfered the funds out... 
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:38:55
+1 and let's up vote this one people....
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:21:29
When I read this article I really thought it had to do with Bitcoin.   The funny part is - they make 5 BILLION off the backs of merchants with their transaction fees.  It is their WHOLE B2B business model.  
@_date: 2014-11-27 18:31:43
LULz - prolly some script kiddie that is 14 too.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:47:07
1.25TH... are those not obsolete now a days?  What do those generate in a day?  .00010000?
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:02:15
Oh it is real alright.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:46:21
Yes.   At the end of the day difficulty/hash rate rises.  It will make it harder to centralize though without significant investment.
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:12:48
The merchant adoption stats came from my head... essentially "fluff" (for now).   
I would be providing the merchant with a Point of Sale unit (tablet) that connects into our APP/Website where the transaction takes place.   Where do you think I should put that section specifically?  
The fees/make money/pricing table will be updated depending on what they wish to have basic/intermediate/full setup.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:15:42
Nice.  Thanks for the info - appreciated!  
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:07:47
I doubt there will be a press release on the winner.  They will keep it on the QT.  Unless the buyer makes it known on twitter like last time.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:45:42
Correct.  And with the amount of transactions that are happening on a daily basis.
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:53:03
Wow... They are in serious trouble if he thinks they can integrate with Bitcoin because we all know they will take a rake on top of the value.
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:58:13
I think they did go below market price did they not? I assume this auction will be the same
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:47:38
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:00:28
I hope so.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:47:32
Especially when you are investing millions of dollars in equipment...
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:11:11
That is not true.  I just put that in there as "fluff"... it will relate more to my geographical area once I get more people adopting/on-board.
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:38:39
LOL - Good.  That guy sounds like a clown.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:01:41
I don't think PBMining would affect price @ all.... IMHO
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:48:37
Looks cool!  I like the idea.  Can you explain more around your addition on NFC chip (who is supported) and HDMI display (what does this do? display total/tax/etc?) for brick and mortar merchants?  Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:01:18
It runs through a series of vacuum tubles.  
@_date: 2014-12-05 06:09:56
Crazy where was this information found or was it word by mouth? 
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:37:37
Hmmm interesting... I wonder why that happened.  Do they only have one year agreements?   They made the switch with blockchain like a year ago did they not?  Is it because of all the hax as of recent and image?
@_date: 2014-11-06 07:00:05
Why is that?  Shittypeg Manatoilet? ;)
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:30:47
Obviously they don't work because they have so much time to troll, think and comment.  Oh wait. scratch out the think part.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:44:46
3.6MIL is the value of the setup.  Most likely a 1M for electrical setup and 30-40,000 dollars a month in power.  They used BTC to purchase the miners.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:35:50
Ehhh... rumor has it this ETF will be under review for ANOTHER YEAR!!!!
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:10:42
According to Americans - it is not.

@_date: 2014-12-11 16:41:09
Those coins are going to the miners.   They are selling them off.  That is what has been happening all year.  Fontas did the pumps all the way to 1,000 and the rest is history.
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:39:39
Ehhh.... I don't see it - someone help
@_date: 2014-05-06 14:21:13
Probably the first in the world to accept electricity payment in bitcoin?   Pretty progressive if you ask me.

@_date: 2014-10-28 16:16:34
Interesting.   How much is still in the wallet?   Prices are a lot higher today! :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:55:27
No - but it should of been them.
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:16:40
LOL - that's the point me thinks.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:46:58
What happened was this group bought millions of dollars in computer mining hardware and set up very expensive gear in very poor conditions/buildings. It goes from bad wiring to infrastructure installation. This only had an impact on the miners that invested that money on those machines. This did not affect the bitcoin community or it's users for payments.
@_date: 2014-11-06 07:00:24


@_date: 2014-12-11 15:30:52
The problem is... Microsoft is not going to be accepting Bitcoin and using it as part of their business... Why?  Because of Bitpay!!!   They are only accepting it to get USD via the mechanism.

@_date: 2014-12-10 20:37:56
Very nice.   Looks great.   Compariable to CoinOS (Github) which is similar.   Do you have the capability of padding a small percentage on top of the exchange price?  How can you add in the price of something in CAD dollars + TIP option or is that a feature that is not built in as of yet?   I have some more questions about the setup/etc.  Do you have an email or should I DM you on here?   Thanks in advance!   
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:43:03
overloaded circuit and then what?
@_date: 2014-10-23 17:36:58
I didn't know that.  Just got informed about it today
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:48:45
Sure.  If you have a fully loaded Azure/Amazon AWS server.  Even then it really is only consuming ram more than compute power.  Payment processing at Visa/MC?  Most likely nominal.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:16:24
It also appears that Russia is going to hit recession in 2015.   In addition to China's problems maybe they all dumping?

I am a proud owner of the SP31s.  Great product.  Let's see what they come out with in 2015.   They have always come below their promised spec though.   
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:37:41
So tell me.   What did you pick.  REMOVE or KEEP?
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:31:19
heavy bear market after February 2014.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:14:58
Let it be known as well that they were forced by the hand of the government to do so.  If they didn't Ottawa would of changed it for them.
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:09:41
You sure?  It's not the foundation?
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:58:01
Very true
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:10:54
by creating a proper setup with racks and cabling job done right.  Not to mention all the heat you have to move out.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:45:03
No they didn't - this has been confirmed.  They are trying to salvage as much as they can.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:16:01
Very true and good point!
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:22:12
Do you like having your information and purchases tracked/sent globally?  Subject to fraud.  the list goes on.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:54:19
You can still get a decent job done within a quick time frame.  To get these machines hashing would not take that long at all unless you run into hardware issues.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:41:56
I saw that last night...  Fairly cheap too.  I wonder who were his customers.  
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:19:43
The Bitcoin hating trolls and bankers - that is.  ;)
@_date: 2014-10-31 16:52:34
Looks good... Why can I not remove exchanges though...  I really only want BTCE price to show up.  Not WinkDex.
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:08:35
I have had the chance to talk to a few merchants.  Local in my city and outside.   Large companies and medium sized ones.  Not many people are purchasing with Bitcoin period.   I can only imagine it is the same on Bitpay's end
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:58:11
Look it up!  Bing or Google is your friend :) modern day mining!  digital currency.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:51:29
Yes....  How much are the Interac fees?   This will be the big deciding factor and increase volume.
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:18:25
This guy is absolutely FUCKED.  First I read about these operators in Vancouver getting screwed over with lame excuse after lame excuse.  NOW THIS?  WOW~~~  I just tweeted him showing my love.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:46:25
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:41:58
So you think Bitpay is holding all bitcoins and making it part of the accounting system/budgets/etc?   Do some more research and come talk to me.
@_date: 2014-05-06 14:32:40
Pretty good.  Wonder what cameras they used and production software?  Would be interested in finding out.
@_date: 2014-12-18 17:46:26
MOON!!!!! hahaha
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:34:51
I agree with this statement.  Especially in Winnipeg.
@_date: 2014-10-31 17:05:29
....I never knew this was exactly 6 years to date.   I will effectively launch my Bitcoin website TODAY.  And make sure of it.  going live.

They were paying roughly 6-7 cents per kilowatt hour.  using 5MW

Bad video quality but fucken hilarious 
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:55:02
Haha ' A chinese guy with a extinguisher does not count ' ... You are right on all those points.  At the bare minimum they could of made the wiring a lot better and cleaner for air to move more efficient.  Where is the btu calculation.  Looks like they were just grabbing air from one side of the building and exhausting it out (or trying to).
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:52:48
Yes - well played indeed ;)
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:40:48
I don't know what they were thinking not to get that much money/product insured.   Then again I am not sure in Bangkok if you can?  Who knows the laws/rules out there.

@_date: 2014-11-19 17:03:36
I am looking forward to what the Canadian Government will regulate/pass for law regarding Bitcoin.   On the enthusiastic front we have opened up a Bitcoin point of sale payment processor for 'brick and mortar' locations here in Canada.    - please spread the word!  Merchant testing under way.
@_date: 2014-10-30 19:10:02

hahahaha 
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:41:01
@_date: 2014-10-23 17:37:24
I agree with you.  Could also have a negative effect as well?
@_date: 2014-11-06 07:01:07
True but they were running a 5MW facility.  That is a crapload of power.  Even in a regular data center servers would not even be running at 1/5th of what these miners were...
@_date: 2014-11-04 21:46:00
I think so too...
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:18:42
Wow.  Who is up to these antics - what is the reason for marking it for deletion?  I would consider him the public face of  Bitcoin (public relations).
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:19:47
I don't know why but I always thought the Winklevoss twins were a bunch of flakes with no concrete proof.   IMHO.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:00:46
Looks like next support (at least on BTCe) is at $320?
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:33:12
Yeah this is fuct.  And he thanks Obama at the end - lulz.
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:32:04
Ya right... That's a bunch of bullshit.  I hate to say it but companies like Bitpay have been killing the bitcoin price too.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:22:10
Hahaha might as well be on Neptune at this point.  Sounds very flakey... What the hell - why isn't anontop there? That would of been a completely RELEVANT conversation for those folks.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:00:20
Tanking... but why?  What is the reason?  Just to exit the market and take the fiat?
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:55:55
HAHAHA - nice one.
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:39:00
This could make prices go down further than todays $355.   Sky may be falling?

@_date: 2014-10-28 16:19:05
Eh.... Does it really matter at the end of the day?  Users simply need to educate themselves.   
@_date: 2014-12-10 17:05:24
I think you should go.  Do not keep more than 1BTC in a online wallet.  End of Story.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:14:26
What IRC network/channel are they using?  This would be good to know.
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:29:53
Hahahaha.... I love the image... NEVER GO FULL PONZI.  GAW Miners and their silly antics.  Don't give your money to that company.
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:58:25
Still trying to find out... This picture JUST came in...  If you look at the hash rate it jumped in early Nov and took a nose dive... It was because of this fire.  I was wondering why the big jump.
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:06:38
What guy is a clown.

Holder - lulz
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:55:59
Great ideas and concepts.   This is still years away.  We need consumer adoption, less price volatility and advantages for consumer AND merchant to pay with BTC over FIAT.  That is what we should be focusing on.   The "network everywhere" effect is nice but not necessary at this point.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:46:37
They most likely only made 1/4 of their money back before the fire.
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:49:49
Yes.  I am doing the same.  Girlfriend, Mom, Dad, Brother all get 1BTC each in a paper wallet.  I am telling them to put it away and look at the value in a year or two.  I am sure they won't mind.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:47:45

I am getting to this point too.  I have always been an entrepreneur.  Not a desk jockey.  Bitcoin is consuming me these days in a good way. Maybe PM me and I can give you some ideas or maybe you can assist me with my future plans depending on your skill set.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:41:33
HORRIBLE wiring job.  Like who does that?  What a disaster.  As a infrastructure/data centre guy.  This makes me cringe.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:44:19
Well.. Bitcoins were not lost... cowboyminer used it to purchase the miners from SPT.  Their investment is gone.
To answer your question.   If someone loses a bitcoin or sends it to a bunk address - yes they are gone for good and unrecoverable.
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:33:10
It could be a possibility.  I don't think so.. I think low 300s.  
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:43:21
Pretty sure he was doing it on his own for profit and doing cloud based/rented miners.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:39:40
Yes,  got more news on it.  It was a 5MW facility based out of Bangkok.  The guy who owned it was called "cowboyminer" his name speaks for itself due to the setup.   I feel bad for his loss but there could of been a lot more to prevent this from happening.  Apparently happened mid October.
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:57:01
This mining hardware is SPT.  Their last batch.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:49:09

This post is GOLDEN!   Great job
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:02:43
Looks like I was right.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:28:44
After charting it out... You should see around the $240 area followed up by a sub-200 in the coming days/week.
@_date: 2015-01-21 05:59:44
4 times faster doe.
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:34:16
Exactly... This is for the people that do not want to deal with the wallet/security/exchanges/etc etc...  Buy and see it perform (up/down).  The thing that would russle my feathers is there is no insurance and liability.  Which is insanity.   If I were an average joe investor I would put my money elsewhere for peace of mind.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:43:08
Absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2015-01-20 18:05:55
Oh it will happen.  Give it time.
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:55:41
I agree.  Save all the hassle of setting up etc.
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:02:40
Uhh... guys this will not increase Bitcoin price... Nice names but still.
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:25:55
What the heck is going to happen to that guy anyway?
@_date: 2015-01-20 18:06:30
Yes....  Why would this add value to the Bitcoin economy at this point in time?  It is just VC money to inject more cashflow into the company and staff.  Coinbase is still in the red at this time.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:53:03
Bitcoin has a LOOOONG way to go (2-10) years for mass adoption.  Many things need to be addressed such as volitility, coin management and wallet/coin security.
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:23:32
Interesting.  I have been using finex for about 5 weeks now and it's great.
@_date: 2015-01-19 05:51:36
LOL to BTC-e chugging along!  LONG LIVE BTC-e
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:42:56
yayed out?  blow?  How do the two correlate? 
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:25:56
I am online with some traders and they think this is exciting news.... sub 200 we go!
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:59:17
Where is the Winklevoss index/capital?
@_date: 2015-01-19 05:18:03
I am Roger Ver.  Look at me go.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:18:55
I agree with the newspaper statement.   Too many noobs will get killed.... coins stolen... poor wallet management and security/etc... the list goes on.
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:10:17
We will wait one hour then.
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:00:15
+1 sir - I am creating an account on the exchange.
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:55:26
Dunning-Krugerrands?  explain...
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:09:47
Where did he post that?
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:47:35
Provide an update with more pictures!

I look forward to trying this out.

Click bait for the organizers of a scam coin that have no clue what they are doing?
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:40:37
STFU with ICO garbage.
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:23:43
You have to give it to Phil (php) *SOMETIMES* - he does try and explain when the dust settles but the excuses are no longer acceptable.   If you are making money and not hiring the right people to fix and address the issues then we have major problems.
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:18:04
OH and I forgot to mention.... Yesterday - roughly 1 hour of flatline trading....   Yesterday was the icing on the cake.
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:19:05
Exactly... It says something like "You already clicked that... I am busy" 
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:57:57
They could of done that better.... you know...
@_date: 2015-08-26 18:44:15
Somewhat agree with this statement
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:39:56
Apparently  they didnt if you check out the other comments....
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:34:38
No I have not... Where are they based out of?  Who owns it?
@_date: 2015-08-19 07:15:42
what did you use to pull this data?  Going through the API?
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:26:49
When you send a tweet it doesn't notify you if you are busy or not looking at it. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:02:51
Glass of whiskey.... hell no... Beer and Fireball my friend. :)
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:22:10
Wow.... some key points I never knew about... very interesting.. How do you know they stole the code?    I totally agree with you their platform is not scale-able.  
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:19:54
Regardless - they are not updating EVERYONE.    Everybody is an equal customer and deserves to be in the know and when trading resumes.   We are in 2015.
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:10:29
I wouldn't do OKC (me personally).  Bot central and they line up behind you or in-front of you.   I am REALLY considering BitMEX and I am dumping some coins back to BTCe.  My originator from years ago.
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:36:16
I opened a ticket.   No reply as of yet. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:25:38
Hey - through the thick and thin BTCe has never been hacked/compromised and has run stable through massive runs up or down.
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:18:26
Who said that?  Phil Potter?
@_date: 2015-08-08 06:17:06
Fees and time.  The struggle is real. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:22:55
How did you guys find out about this information?
@_date: 2015-08-21 04:31:20
Cool.   Good to know.   Any specific url you recommend or google it shall be. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:37:08
Sheesh.... you learn something new every day...
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:05:01
We don't have too many options... that is the problem.
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:40:28
Right on... Kind of a wacked out name but that is the Bitcoin world for ya :)  Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:43:53
Well now - this is getting upvoted....  We need to make more people and traders aware about this...
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:07:23
Good.  LOL
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:08:53
Good guy Mark for digging through the document and stating some un-true facts.  Where was he when the Gox investigation was going on? lol
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:25:06


@_date: 2015-07-06 14:22:05
LOL - that is quite sad.

@_date: 2015-07-29 20:07:58
@_date: 2015-07-03 14:23:35
Is this REALLY exciting news?  Not so much....  
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:26:38
Tipsy?  As in lame explanations as to root cause?
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:11:29
MEH.  Yes and No.  You have to see the bigger picture at the end of the day.  It's Money 2.0
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:46:19
LOL!  here it is equipped with the cash hoarder 2 patch.  Pay close attention to the PSN handle/name :)  
@_date: 2015-04-08 21:43:07
Hahah right on man!!  Here are the pre-reqs:  Zipline purchased, Sabotage Tool purchased, Grappling hook purchased, Explosive coins 5/5, Zipline coins 5/5, Grapping hook coins 5/5 - enjoy
@_date: 2015-04-22 06:31:32
...So that is why it went up
@_date: 2015-04-09 14:22:47
LOL.  Well I wouldn't make an assignment patch the "changes everything" aspect.   All in all - the game is great.  I have a blast playing it.  Cannot wait for the map packs to come to.
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:31:18
I signed up and went through verification.  I actually checked and I did this a couple weeks ago and my account is still pending verification.  Yikes.  If CAVIRTEX gets me back up and running as my 2FA isn't working after PWD reset.   I will stay.  I had no problems with them and purchasing coins in the past.  Let's hope it stays that way.
@_date: 2015-04-08 21:21:40
True dat.  Coming from a hardcore bitcoiner.
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:10:28
Yes it is great.  I am surprised I am at level 103 already.  I am only 86 on BF4.  ADDICTED!  Different play style however.
@_date: 2015-09-10 22:02:04
Good to know and validates Bitcoin security in global markets.

Ya right... you will mine minuscule amounts with it.. waste of time.   Buy a bigger miner.

@_date: 2016-10-31 23:29:45
Golden prophecy!~  
@_date: 2015-11-23 21:41:00
....But it is possible.... Are they making money?  Absolutely not...  They thought this was going to be mass-adopted by now...
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:09:21
...on both ways too!  Don't trade these conditions you fools ;)
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:02:27
Good points here... I have all my friends wanting to get in now and I refuse to let them in at this price.... There is no reason for the price to be up like this right now as well..... smart people will sit and watch on the side lines.

Hahaha Good one!

Seriously.... not even competitive to other exchanges... nice web design and UI and sure it is regulated and insured money....    but NO FUTURES or MARGIN?  What?   Where are the market makers and institutional money that they were suppose to bring?  To throw a bone - they should of added zero fees for the first month or something too....  Those are my thoughts...

One bar yes......   What about multiples? :P
@_date: 2015-10-08 15:00:22
Could be true... I agree with segregating the leverage products.... that is easy to do....   they had tons of time to do regression testing though... so one would think they launch and they have clients right off the bat... but looks like they don't.
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:50:34
Who says you can't post images to the blockchain?   I believe you can... Encoded or some other way.
@_date: 2015-10-20 17:15:33
Apply and try.  You still have time.
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:55:23

@_date: 2015-10-08 14:58:59
Nothing at the moment... Unless somebody can educate me otherwise... But I stated my points below..

definitely cheaper storing bitcoins than gold and less risk.  IMHO.
