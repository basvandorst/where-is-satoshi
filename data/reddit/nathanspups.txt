Thank you very much for that information. That's the type of thing I really wanted to find out. 
It's easy to say I'm stupid now, but it could have gone the other way.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:22:18
Yes I believe in Bitcoin!

Did my eye patch give it away?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:25:43
I assume you're joking, but I wouldn't be surprised if we could tbh.

I have a large amount of money on Mt.Gox and most people told me that I should have held after I sold. Now the price is much lower. If it goes up I will make back my losses.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:23:05
Yes, thank you very much. This is what I was hoping for when I posted this. 
I must say I've been pretty dismayed by the rest of the posts in this thread.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:19:32
Yes this is true(although I still have hope regarding the marriage). If it doubles again I would be back to even. 
I appreciate the concern, but really I'm just trying to think rationally. I understand the risk involved, but I also the the potential upside, both financially and personally.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:57:18
Yes, this is good advice. 
If this were 2008 I could have just as easily had savings in the stock market and the result would have been the same.

Yes, I don't hate them. And now that I think about it, it's people like me who enabled them to go from Bitcoin millionaires to USD millionaires. I certainly don't hold any ill will towards any individual people. I hope they enjoy their wealth and learn from people like myself so they are able to avoid making the same mistake I did.

In this case though with the amount of money we're talking about here it might be worth it. 
It's not the same as 100,000 people claiming their $30 dollar refund for some defective product.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:14:48
If it goes up to the mid 100s again I would be even again. 
Is this realistic?

Not regulated by the SEC, but do they have no liability under Japanese law?
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:10:14
Thank you.

If this is the case then I might not be able to make it all back, but quite a bit of it if I can sell at the right time.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:09:26
I'm sorry too, but like I said before, there's no one to blame but myself. 
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:15:25
Good stuff, thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:14:06
We had been discussing it for a while. It's not that I didn't want her to be apart of the decision, she didn't understand it, and still doesn't. Eventually she just decided to trust me, and now this is the result.
I take full responsibility for what I've done.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:22:31
Good point.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:59:11
People, it's not about financial regulations. 
I want to know if they could be held liable under Japanese law for their failure to provide their service costing people millions of dollars.
It's more about consumer protection than it is about financial regulations.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:14:57
Thank you.

Yes, ultimately it was my decision. 
But where do we draw the line with Mt.Gox? If they were to shut down to tomorrow, of course we would all sue them to attempt to recover our money.
If someone at Gox made a technical error and they lost all of the Bitcoins, again we would sue.
Their technical incompetence led to the loss of over 1 billion dollars or more of market value. So I think it's reasonable to at least consider if what they did merits some sort of legal action. 
Again, with regards to personal investments, each individual is ultimately  responsible for their own money. But just because it's an unregulated cryptocurrency does not mean that there are no laws. 
I think it would be irresponsible to just compeletely disregard the fact that the customers of Mt.Gox may have been wronged.

Thank you.

There is a difference between financial regulations and corporate liability/consumer protection laws. 
It's not about financial regulations.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:42:49
Thanks for all the comments everyone. 
It crossed my mind that I should mention that there are no kids involved at this point. If there were things would have been different.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:26:44
And people seem to think anything related to Bitcoin is outside the law, when in reality that is not the case at all.
Appreciate your posts greatly. I figured with the amount of money we're dealing with here it would be irresponsible for me not to at least inquire.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:26:02
Sounds like we're in similar situations then. The cash is just sitting there at the moment, a lot of it gone, but the price is much lower now so if I get back in now and it goes up a lot then I'd be good.
