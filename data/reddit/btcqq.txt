A Libertarian wouldn't need some dude to tell him what to think.  Of course they fell into a con.  I have to admit as I get older having to always watch my ass in the various third world countries i go to is tiring.  Check every bill for a coutnerfeit, haggle over every price, never trust a railing, always barricade the door at night, lol.
I'm not saying america isn't the greatest country in the world.  I just think we shouldn't be complacent and think the government does everything.  They don't.  We, the people, do.
And I'm sick of everytime a new tech comes out we act like a bunch of scared old ladies and try to shut it down before it can even get off the ground, because 'what about drug dealers ' 'what about terrorists'... like we're so scared of our shadows now of anything new.

9600 is just a dip i say 'pullback' when referring to the 2nd retracement line.  I dont think a 'pullback' is happening til 20k, back to 15k.  That should really scare out some weak hands.
As far as dips yeah this one was very anticipated, just buy them all until 20k.. then start looking to sell or draw down to a position you're comfortable taking a big hit on for a while.

so get your ducks in a row, release guidance, etc I dont see why they gotta go around scaring college kids just starting their lives to shake them down for pennies.  Would it kill our budget?  This market should be a godsend to the IRS, in the long run.
This is how they used to operate, in the early silicon valley days.. they cut people slack just starting out, etc. now its like boot on neck right away, right out of college.
I mean look at the downvotes on this forum either im crazy for thinking how i do, or we have a bunch of scared youth trying to race to outdo each other to lick boot with platitudes like 'oh its good for bitcoin to get bent over like this'.  Bullsh*t guys.  Grow a pair man.  A bitcoin exchange and a bitcoin user should have the same rights as someone using a stock exchange or trading stocks.  Why the special treatment?

I think the overall problem I have with everyone else is I dont really care about the poor.  I'm a bad person.  I just dont like dropping bombs on the poor with 50 million$ predator drones.   So apparently I'm still better than 50%?
Poor people are often happy and want to be rich, I'd say give them that opportunity - they can't if they're dead tho.
I'm an engineer. of course I'd plan.  I'd take the trillion from not invading Iraq and hire elon musk or some of my silicon valley buds to plan it out, if i wasnt up to the task.

Wouldn't take it, am in the US maybe 20% of the year.
I use china's infrastructure.  Which sucks, but somehow we all manage to survive.  Still gotta pay taxes.  
Point is we don't have a choice.  If I wanted to start building my own roads with a group of likeminded people, and use those roads, the government would shoot me.   IF i wanted to opt out of the tax system and just pay for their roads on a use basis with tolls, they'd put me in a cell.   FREEDOM.
Of course you're happier in life thinking you have options as long as you never choose to exercise those options.
Most people do that.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:20:02
no, it did not.  People dont know what a blockchain is.  But i think they can make the leap from 'bitcoin' to 'bitcoin and litecoin' to 'just another crypto'  pretty easily.
And that's the message I see slowly emerging on CNBC.  Don't see how that's great for us.  I'd like a bitcoin guy on TV explaining how we have the best devs and best tech, but all i see is devs splitting off onto their own forks, secretly working on side-projects, going from 'friend' to 'frenemy' to 'backstabber'..  who knows wtf they're really planning.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:32:55
my experience is people still aren't buying, I'm not saying go half-in like me but you know at least put in 5% if it crashes you lose 5% if it moons you probably buy an island
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:08:38
you can sell probably 100k and pay virtually no taxes after standard deductions and landing in the lower LTCG brackets.
So If i had a mil in bitcoins I'd slice of 100k a year for 10 years, each Dec 31.  Then rebuy Jan 1 ( depending on how the FIFO works).
Of course knowing there's gonna be huge sell pressure on dec 31, i might do it on Dec 13 instead.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:03:18

the answer is yes, I'd take the option.  Even if i had to live without roads.  I'd buy an ATV.  Big deal.  I'd have no blood on my hands.

it could fail if the bitcoin devs stop maintaining it, if there's a 51% attack, if the blockchain freezes up, if net neutrality fails and comcast starts charging for node bandwidth and node operators shut down.  Catastrophes can also hit if blockchain encryption fails, source code bugs that are silently exploited causing silent blockchain corruption that's not forkable - 
there's a million ways it can fail.

hodl'rs dont affect market price (other than reducing supply).  They dont transact, they dont hit the bid, they dont make an ask.  If everyone hodl's then one person sells one bitcoin for 1 penny to another, the official market price of bitcoin is then 1 penny.

also one of his descendants told a woman that he couldnt buy a condom cuz the mempool was under attack and all his $$ was in bitcoin so she said 'ok just this once' and she ended up having a kid and that kid was named jebediah hodler the 5th.. there's a long lineage of hodlers that have intriguing tales.

they're assholes for doing what they believe in?  How did they hurt you?  I'm wondering what talking head told you to hate those guys.  You judged them on what an interview of 1% of them for 3 seconds of conversation on some propaganda hit piece?  You don't know them at all.  Worse than a bigot - at least a bigot gets his hatred from within not something he saw on TV - there's a certain sick dignity to that.
The only guy I'm hating on is the conman who ran the whole thing, the others were probably just victims.
I look around at my fellow countrymen and i see it everywhere, the rush to judgement, the hatred, the jealously, it's like we're a collection of some dudes you read about in the bible who are about to go to hell in a handbasket, lol.
Noone is just 'cool' anymore.  Everyone hates someone.  When i go abroad.. I see none of it.. poor people who have it 100x worse than us have more love in their hearts than we do.
When i was yougn they had a guy jim jones who went to a south american coutnry and brainwashed all his followers into drinking poison koolaid, and I remember not hating those guys.. just feeling bad.. it was such a waste of life.  Nowadays I wonder if people have even that level of compassion anymore.. I dont see it at all.

you cant just go up to a bunch of black people and go most of you are gangbangers, so we're gonna arrest all of you.   Just start auditing bitcoin users on an individual basis.  Until there's proof of wrongdoing the government has to assume that you're one of the 800 - innocent, until proven guilty.
We have a tax system in place that drains 2 tril a year out of our economy.  It works and its onerous as hell.  I've been working on my taxes all day today.  Trust me - we're not mexico.  None of these small potatoes, mostly geeks college kids are not gonna get away with much.
The mafia wasnt trading on coinbase in 2015.  It's not some national crisis where we should throw out the laws because its a national emergency. bitcoins were like 100$ back then.  Alot probably were under 20k.
I mean we preach freedom and rule of law here but soon as something new or scary happens we instantly throw away our principles and role out the gestapo tactics.  They're singling out a group of people - bitcoin users and applying unique laws to them, and yeah financial privacy is important.  what if we just started looking at all of the bank accounts of gays.. or journalists.. would that not be oppression?
If you were to listen to the media you'd think we're all in ISIS or something.. read this reddit.. what's the vibe you're getting here?    We're geeks.. we're smart.. and now we're all rich.  And bitcoin wallets are going to be set up in congress.. and you'll see the tide turn very soon.

you could design a system via consensus.  Imagine a perfect solution, solution X which causes the least disruption and anger amongst the stakeholders - 
Bob and Joe would be able to contribute their inputs through a blockchain, not just a simple vote - more like a weighted vote with metadata.  It wouldn't be the same as bitcoin, but look up the altcoins, they're doing stuff like this.
The system would not be perfect, but via a node-based scoring system could be the solution that would cause the least amount of anguish, etc.   Also noone could hack it, corrupt it, etc.. and it would be far more expensive to buy off than the value of the roads to the corruptor, or far more expensive than some county alderman, lol.
What are the odds that a single planner, no matter how intelligent, would come up with a solution that would be preferable to it?
We as human like to see pretty people come up with magic solutions, then donate total faith to them, and not be critical.. thats our tribal roots.   We are even programmed to hate people who criticize that pretty person.  
But it's wrong.  What I said, is right, lol.  Or at least 100x better.  You'll see.  Ugly, but REALLY smart people are working on it.  They'll be sure to get a pretty face to sell it to you before changing the world tho..

In 2012, Stack and her team were hired to rebrand Pfizer Animal Health as it spun out from a subsidiary into its own company. As they looked at the name Pfizer, the letter "z" stuck out and got ideas rolling. When searching for appropriate words, "zoetic," a Greek word meaning "pertaining to life," seemed a perfect fit. And in regards to phonetics, changing the hard "c" into a soft "s" made it a warmer word, and thus Zoetis became "elevated above the rest of the pharma landscape," according to Stack.

well noone's ever proven the RSA key pair thing has been hacked (its based on prime numbers so it would be big news in the math world)
but i think the major suppliers of RSA keys all have backdoors.  But of course bitcoin wouldnt use a 'rsa supplier' they'd generate their own.  But it's still kind of created this distrust of RSA in crypto circles, they like AES and ECC more.  Also I think RSA has a history of being brute forced every 10 years or so due to moore's law.  So they keep increasing the key size.  And people are always paranoid of 'key space reduction' attacks.
I only 'kinda' know what im talking about here, tbh.

it's true but we implemented all those programs in the 60's.  All we saw of the USSR was massive industrial and economic growth from the 5 year plans, so we thought it would be a good way to revitalize our lower class.
 But the soviets already had signs from their internal (secret) economic data it was a massive failure.  
 The commie officials themselves said every region they absorbed into the USSR and implemented their economic 'reforms' inevitably collapsed.  It's the whole reason for perestroika with gorbachev and deng xiao ping in china.  They knew more than we did because they were secretive regimes.
We had a stronger economy than the soviets, so we're able to kind of anchor-float alot of these programs until eventually we'll end up with the same result, ruin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:23:16

'store of value' is tough to understand in the first place, even for the elite.  I understand it but i have a lot of smart friends who don't.  Don't want to see a 'flippening'.  I don't see with our market cap and huge head start why we can't be in first place for LN.
I mean blockPeriod = 2.5; and you make 3 billion dollars and beat bitcoin to LN?  dont get how.
I'mma fork blockPeriod = 1.25;

the asia whale traders not all of asia.. the exchanges dont like it, from what i can tell the congestion causes deposit/withdrawal delays and too many customer support tickets etc.. but litecoin will have the same problems as it gains adoption too.
Most people convert to LTC when withdrawing now already.. this is just making the BTC-&gt;LTC send to exchange then LTC-&gt;BTC then buy altcoin conversion unnecessary.. buy the altcoins directly in LTC.
A big part of BTC demand is the fact that you need to buy it to buy alot of altcoins.

theres not much time left for that to happen... once a player hits 200 billion market cap it starts cannibalizing competition fast, they can buy off key devs, key regulators, crush the competition.

Yeah.. thats an accurate chart.  Thats the REAL instamine.

It's allllllllllllllllllllllll going into bitcoin (and real estate.. and macao junkets.. lol)
the money changers in HK frequently pay more for USD20's because 100's are like toiler paper money over there.  and china and hong kong all frantically print their toilet paper to try to match the peg to our toilet paper.

founders hold coins, they have an interest in seeing their projects succeed, they can pay devs with coins.
the higher the market cap, the more they can do this.
doesn't matter whether the coins are premined, or sold in an ICO, or what, its the same incentive system.
There's more money going into bitcoin than an unknown fork with 100k market cap, for instance.

Bitcoin will be worth alot more because they were first mover but to think that better tech will just evaporate all the altcoins now plastered over my VPN payment processor is silly.

bitcoin aint money u use.. its too valuable for that.. its money u hodl.  the biggest 'fee' with spending bitcoin is that in a year you realize you paid 10x what you thought you did.
If you spend 5$ on a cup of coffee today you may be lamenting the 10$ fee you had to pay to get it.. but in 5 years you'll be lamenting the fact that you spent 5* 10^5 + 10 = 500,010$ on a cup of coffee.

oh you would have said bitcoin was handwaving 10 years ago (my friends still do)  if i could design it still i would (too old to code that much now).. someone will.  And he won't be rich either.. he'll be smart, and become very rich.
And world hunger is being solved as we speak.. by other smart, nor rich,  people. not politicians.  
you dont have to believe me, it's fine.  Noone really cares what either of us believe. the tech will happen anyway.
All I can say is.. SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE AND BUY WHEN IT DOES.
Also 'the richest guy' deciding in a consensus model is like saying the 'biggest miner' controls bitcoin.  They don't.. read up on it - talk to Roger Ver, lol.  Truth is even Satoshi himself doesnt control the blockchain.
A 51% attack is possible, but like i said it's a lot more expensive to pull off a 51% attack on a consensus model than to just bribe one politician or 'the richest guy' - you kids oooh hate rich people right?

That too hard?
Cant you just lose the seed as easily as you lose the private key? wtf it makes no sense lol.  who remembers a sequence of 20 words?  They did it in the old days to make 'bitcoin anonymous'.  We all know tracker coins arent anonymous.. you want anonymous use a real privacy altcoin.

it wont be banned.  Some big whale with a 1 mil stash of BTC's will donate a few BTC's to some foundation and all of a sudden all the ban talk will disappear.  The ban talk right now is for the politicians to scare the whales into donating 10k btc instead of 1k.
We'll soon have a whole slew of politicians talking about 'visionary' bitcoin. 1 year tops.  Anyone not jumping on board or asking the wrong questions will have a short career thereafter.. Al franken style.
The window where a politican can even suggest banning bitcoin is RAPIDLY closing (exponentially). 
Already I see people getting emotional pro-bitcoin.. regular joes, soon as they own 100$ in bitcoins they go from 'oh thats for terrorists and drug dealers' to 'f with my bitcoin and you lose my vote'

this makes sense. the institutions will be buying futures to provide bitcoin-tracking products to clients who are no doubt now demanding them.  Then the prop traders doing the smart cotango/arb plays to produce reliable returns for hedge fund investors
I highly doubt there's this big demand to short into a crazy bull market.. noone's calling up their broker going I WANNA SHORT BITCOIN!!!  shorts are for daytraders.  Big institutional money is always long.  There's no 401k with a 'short commodities' fund.. there's a few bear ETF's but most are bull etfs with leverage, or just 1x.  There's no pension/retirement fund with 'short commodities' plays.

you always close the contract before the delivery date, thats why mom and pop dont trade futures, you have to fill out paperwork and stuff.  There's usually a price rush in the market on delivery days as people scramble to buy the underlying.. But as I said the contract is settled in CASH according to what I've heard.  So there is no 'delivery' of bitcoin.  Thats why im not that bullish on it.  In other words the 'delivery' is just USD.
I also believe that settling in usd is something they'd do, because the bitcoin wallets on exchanges are nothing but hassles.. always getting hacked, extra management, etc.  I think unregulated exchanges see the wallet as a 'piggy bank' to loot and regulated ones see it as a big liability insurance risk

if its a bubble - try to extrapolate where the top is.
Bubble's very, very good.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:09:29
i dont see why thats such a huge bull.  Only professional investors (who already know about bitcoin) get futures accounts, so it wont spread much awareness beyond the news when it opens.  It's not like mom and pop trade the CME.  If they're settled in cash you dont need to buy the underlying either.   They will frequently just buy collars to limit their losses or some kind of butterfly.. and none of those plays involve short or long the underlying.
it'll pave the way to being able make a ticker tracking ETF using futures contracts.. again without having to buy the underlying 21,000,000 coins.  So as the real money buys that ETF, the underlying bitcoin is no longer deflationary.  The big etrade/ameritrades will outcompete some of the really shoddy exchanges out there, which really DO trade the underlying.  Only the hodlers with hard wallets will be causing deflationary pressure on bitcoin at that point.

I used to do that too but last time i tried it got stuck and i had to child with parent that sh*t and did a double spend and pay 20$ in fees to boot :(
I fail at trading/spending bitcoin.  My only strength is hodling

you can't offset income with short term capital losses
and the carryover is a whopping 3000$ deduction from income
I've been doing that since the stock market crash in 08.  
Anyway i dont care.. just stfu why is this such a big deal to you you clearly dont even know how taxes work for an investor.   Why would you say this stuff?  Like anyone.. dont listen to that guy.. he's wrong, lol.

well to be fair I'll be up ON THE MOON and from up there a 20 mil fluctuation looks like an ant doing the backstroke.. it barely reads.  But yeah that''ll be in 2025.  Only downside is the 7 second delay on all my trades when i radio em in to NASA.  So all you who sold for your precious FIAT good luck.

2020 it should hit around 10 million.. I still think it could go higher.

well just find the link for me that does the proper analysis because I've yet to see one.  And i know there are professional futures traders on here.  They keeping their lips zipped.
You might be able to buy 100 bitcoins on GDAX then sell a call on the CME and have a covered call, or something to that effect, they might think it will spur buying that way I dont know.

I have to admit im a bit.. scared to be hodling right after a 800% runup given the tenor of the people inhabiting the reddit now - not exactly cypherpunk early adopters
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:19:15
to tell the truth i wanted to move it to other exchanges to buy some altcoins and i thought it was overpriced but got tired of waiting on the sidelines.  So I made a 3am purchase at an all time high that got there on almost no volume.

yeah im glad i had no stop loss so i recovered some of my losses.. only down a new car now :( gdax should stop trading everytime it goes down to enforce hodl's lol.  I'm not rich either.  I just got really greedy and put in like half my retirement account in.  Literally an hour later it moved down the most in bitcoin history.

the press release said settled in cash, you dont have the right to demand physical delivery (virtual delivery?)
It makes sense.. managing those wallets and the hack risk is a pain
anyway the goldbugs back 'in the day' said this is how they ringfence deflationary assets (like gold)
But I'm not a futures guys.. I've traded options and I know some CME guys but if everyone says its bullish, then there must be something i dont know.
everytime i bring these points up i never get answers you're the first 2 people to respond to me.

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:11
I put in so much lol.. anyway I guess I'll just hodl.  GDAX is down so no choice.  
I got greedy :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:21:39
any coins under 1 mil are cheap
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:11:51
well except ethereum and litecoin
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:50:36
I bet i have one of the largest losing positions on here right now at 11,200.  I went half in with the retirement fund :(
The blood drained out of my face an hour later.
If it gets down to 8k I'm throwing the other half in then calling the mortgage broker.
