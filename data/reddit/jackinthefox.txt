I dont disagree with you, mostly. not sure what circumcision has to do with anything, but i agree religion and national identity have nothing to with it. aside from using an american document, and not editing out the word god i am not sure where i am guilty of placing either of those in the discussion. 
 this is about people asserting they have rights that are not given to them by the state and therefore cannot be removed by the state. im sorry you dont like their choice of words.

why is it wrong?

You did, saying our rights come from a higher power is the same as saying we are born with them. It is not an endorsement of religion. It was the best way for the founding fathers to assert that their rights are inalienable from their existence.

my ignorance is vast. no need to compare ignorances...

I know... but asserting that our rights are derived from a higher power and only protected by government is necessary. anyway. opensource. edit as you see fit

well i would argue that people with your beliefs about rights wrote the patriot act. either way. i didnt intend to argue the importance of the word god in the declaration of independence. i was just trying to provoke thought about separation of money and state. perhaps this isnt the place

i would add you didnt tear it apart apart so much as show your ignorance.

ok, i see your point. i did not add it. i only edited key words. I have no position on the existence of god. change it to nature. life. whatever. it just cant come from man or mans law.

ok, well i believe the logical argument is that if its given to us by a higher power (wink, Wink) then we can claim it and fight for it. if its given to us by man or law then man or law can take it away from us
