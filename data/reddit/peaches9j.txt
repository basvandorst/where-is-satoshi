There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that he is a xenophobe. 
You have to be an idiot to disagree with his main arguments since they are backed up by sound logic and  theory. For example, his view on equal pay (which is probably how he first came into the spotlight) is completely rational and logical. 
The only criticism I have of him is that he never talks about his religious beliefs when prompted. I think this is rather irrational since it's a perfectly reasonable question to ask somebody, especially when being interviewed.

I wear my shoes everyday commuting to and from work. Now think about how many times you look at peoples shoes and wh-.........
Just kidding! this is for my own personal gratitude for bitcoin. I like to be reminded of how lucky I am to be part of this revolution in technology.
Super comfy though.

This is great. We need more of this infographic simplicity, not because people don't have the capacity to understand how the lightning network works, but because some people respond better to bite-size chunks of information and graphics. This will likely encourage and set them on a journey to truly understanding crypto. Bravo to your efforts.

Is the term 'full node' too confusing to the layman though? Maybe something like 'the complete network of connected nodes' would be more suitable?

Awesome, thanks for clarifying. Haha I'm 25x from 7920. My stake is relatively small but still I stand a good chance of making a decent profit. Fingers crossed!

Is there a maximum profit from leveraged trading? Say if I leveraged 25x at 8000 and the price went to 16,000. I would theoretically get 2500% profit. What if I left my position open and the price went to 160,000. That would mean a 25,000% profit. Would I be forced to take profit before that?

I'd say keep ETH and sell LTC for BTC. At least then you have two solid investments with great potential. LTC could fail (more so than BTC and ETH IMO).

How on earth is this tweet remotely racist/sexist? 
He's simply stating that he wants to interview anyone other than investors from a white male background since they are only in it for profit. Surely he's being inclusive of the 'other side' i.e. the 6 billion people that need BTC.
Please don't cry.
