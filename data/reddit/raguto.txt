You can't just create an account on an exchange and then deposit crypto onto the exchange? You shouldn't need to verify just for the purpose of depositing crypto onto an exchange or trading the crypto, verifying is generally only required if you want to withdraw or deposit fiat. Find a way to obtain crypto as well, maybe go with the selling mmo gold to a gold buying website route.

Nah, hold onto your butts or you might lose it on the drop. This happens all the time, the increase will be big and so there's no point in selling.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:07:10
Stop with the obsession in mining bitcoin, it isn't worth your time, go buy some bitcoin on the dip.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:35:16
It's mostly just guesswork, get your money on an exchange like gdax and use the limit option so you make offers that don't fill instantly, this is to pay less fees or avoid fees entirely for the purpose of maximizing profits. As for the guesswork that I mentioned you'll be doing for day trading, you will basically be guessing lows and highs based on what you feel, it's extremely difficult to predict because it is very unpredictable, you could be day trading litecoin and the moment you sell out, litecoin could start sky rocketing just for the sake of some news coming out about it or someone popular saying good things about it, any number of things, if you ignore the possibility of news being released that will affect the prices then just go based on how much they've raised in a short amount of time, like buying on the recent crash was a sure way to make profit, the prices have increased some from the lowest crash price, you could sell now if you had bought the dip for the sake of predicting a dip should come soon as buyers run out, you may end up being right or not on said prediction.

Sounds fine, not sure what audience you're looking to attract, bitcoin investors probably wouldn't listen to this.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:10:00
Yeah everyone on here that's invested in Bitcoin has definitely been taxed more by their job and so they haven't made any money at all, they've actually lost more money, so yeah, it costs you money to be involved with Bitcoin.

Sure, create an account on an exchange, choose the option to deposit bitcoin on the exchange and then put in the corresponding addresses necessary to do so and then you can sell. Anything else? You can use Bitfinex, Binance, GDAX, depending on where you live, I use Bitfinex and I don't need to verify to trade Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:30:13
I have a feeling that if this were true and the case, everyone would be doing it and be making thousands of dollars. So, is everyone?
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:05:06
Yeah, probably, I bet you that a ton of people got scared and pulled out for good, from the crash before christmas in 2017 and the crashes that have happened up until now have kept a lot of people away, it's kinda worrying that bitcoin appears to be losing attraction and not getting very many people on-board with it anymore, if something strong doesn't seriously happen then I highly doubt we'll see bitcoin hit 20k again, it's going to take something very compelling to get as many people to hop back on the train that is bitcoin for it to go up as much as it did towards the end of 2017, is the hype over? perhaps.
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:28:33
No, I used VirWox when I first got into bitcoin and when I tried to transfer my bitcoin off the site, it took them 2 days to check it, and then they refunded my paypal money and disabled my VirWox account. It does not work the way you think it does, they realize the high risk that paypal chargebacks bring and are not going to just let you take the bitcoin you buy away from their site.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:11:37
Good news seems to mean less and less as an impact for Bitcoins price. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:05:43
Yeah, how about no, this post is pure FUD, there's a minimum cost to even mine bitcoin and it's highly unlikely that the price is going to drop below that value, also, there's this large HODL mentality here on the bitcoin subreddit which will hold a strong resistance at some value we can't quite determine.  If you want to invest 500 USD, you should do it with the strong confidence that if it drops more that you will be fine with holding out until it goes higher to even consider selling for a profit, also, if you're really worried, just invest half of your 500 and hold the other half tight for if a stronger dip occurs. Oh yeah and 500 dollars isn't going to make you much profit in bitcoin even with a big move, invest in something cheaper that still has volatility.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:16:11
There is minor good news for bitcoin almost everyday and times like this still happen, bitcoin tanks, I don't think this will do anything to lift bitcoin up.

@_date: 2018-03-29 19:40:15
Don't use VirWox or LocalBitcoins, they are going to be overpriced and LocalBitcoins is full of scammers, if you're fine with that then go ahead, also, don't expect to transfer your bitcoin away from VirWox if you choose that route.

You don't really need 1 whole bitcoin to justify the necessity of a hardware wallet, If you want to keep your money as secure as you possibly can and you've got at least 500-1000 dollars invested then going for a hardware wallet like a Trezor should be a no-brainer.

Stop being so convinced that the value is going to continue to go up or quadruple what it's at right now, you have absolutely no clue, unexpected things happen all the time and it's a possibility that bitcoins going to go up and down around the same value or stagnate for an entire week or even go down.
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:58:39
I'm sure buyers will step in, we'll just have to wait and see just when that happens, pretty sure people have money on standby waiting for a significant dip to happen. I think the cost of creating bitcoin is so high right now and the strong HODL mentality of this subreddit will create a strong resistance line at some price, so that it won't drop below there.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:32:18
I don't really know about the best or most secure online wallets, hope someone else can help you with that.

I'm not making that claim, I am telling you that you are spreading false information by making the claim in your original post that "by which time the coin will have quadrupled in value." Which is simply an indeterminable claim, you can go look at your graphs and study your statistics, that's fine, it doesn't mean you can make such a claim with a high degree of accuracy, so if you don't mind, can you please stop spreading false information.

Not a lot people buying or selling lately, you can think and come to conclusions about why that might be, what is your thoughts? I think people will start buying or selling more when some bigger price changing happens, bitcoin hasn't been that volatile for like 2 days.

I really don't know, I think you're right that if you contacted them and told them the situation they would probably close your account. You may really just need to wait until you can get an I.D and then you'd be set. You might be able to get an I.D at 17 depending on where you live.
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:18:33
No, because you probably didn't buy bitcoin when it was 0% up for the day, if you had though then you would be up 30%. the +% increase is also a 24 hour time-frame so likely you got it when it was already up.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:58:18
Perhaps people got scared away from this huge price decrease? People's emotional instinct is to stay away from something falling but the smart people are buying all along this fall.

Bitcoin hit 6k today, not mid 2018.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:08:36
Your original statement was that it's going to replace fiat money, you're thinking in very unrealistic ways if you're gonna sit here and claim that bitcoins going to take over fiat money in 5 years. You're essentially in la-la land. Bitcoin is becoming more and more mainstream as you say and it's becoming more and more accepted, that doesn't necessarily mean fiat money will become worthless or won't be the main form of currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:17:45
Bitcoin has value because a lot of people believe it does, it also has a plethora of uses and is very beneficial to people, this also gives it its value. If you create a cryptocurrency, it would be your job to convince people why they should see value in it, it would be worthless to everyone unless you got them to believe it has value, so good luck in your journey. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:21:46

Can you elaborate on how that would work? So say I sent you 1 bitcoin, you could see it on the blockchain but if there isn't any confirmations on it, the same 1 bitcoin could be sent to another address? But how would the second send confirm faster and before the first one that is sent?

Kraken requires higher tier verification to deposit USD into it, I think it is tier 3. The way that I started with bitcoin was by selling gold in an online MMO to a trusted buyer and told them to pay me in bitcoin, that allowed me to completely skip the bank and debit card steps and the long wait/fees for bank transfers.
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:49:23
Just keep a portion of the bitcoin you're selling to them as the payment they would've given you in cash, so that way you're getting them to pay with bitcoin.

I don't trust localbitcoins because of scams, coinbase is also not available in my country. I have went through a tough time finding a site myself, after a few days of signing up on a dozen sites I found Kraken. Kraken sucks for trading though, it's super slow and you constantly encounter errors. So I can't really suggest any if you want to do day trading. Some of the websites that work well have higher fees, kraken has quite a low fee for trading so that's why I'm there now.

If you're really that inhibited from obtaining bitcoin, you can do what I did, I essentially sold gold from one of the mmo's that I dabble in daily and told the buyer that I accept bitcoin as payment for my gold, that got me bitcoin in what ever website/wallet I desired. I don't know much of any other way if you can't do it through your bank. Maybe someone else has an idea.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:19:36
Uh, that's a guess? and a guess is trash at being accurate. You're being convinced on bad evidence.
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:13:07
I think he is trying to be somewhat safe in his prediction, should create a tighter prediction and give us more accurate numbers. I think bitcoin is going to hit 6k relatively soon, it isn't going to take several months to make it there. You could say bitcoin will hit 6k right before or right after the bitcoin gold fork. That's definitely much sooner than mid-2018. It's easy to make an accurate prediction when your prediction is so open-ended and vague, I think bitcoin will be 25k between the date this is posted and by 2050.

Well, supply and demand affects the prices of all things, limited or not. I don't think it's market manipulation if someone who has the money to buy a lot of bitcoin just makes the decision to buy or sell bitcoin, the term "manipulation" implies some intent behind the buying or selling. Which you have no idea the intent unless the "whale" says "look guys im selling my 5,000 bitcoins and my intent is to cause it to crash." For all you know they may have other reasons for the actions they're taking. Your other reasons seem right.

I think you need to cut your profits short and sell sooner when it appears high and buy sooner when it appears on a dip. If it goes up and you're in profit, you don't know if it's going to continue going up or if it's going to turn around and make the big dip, the only thing you can do is make a guess and sell/buy sooner. If you sell early and it went up a bit more, well you couldn't predict such a thing would happen, you take the profits you made and be happy that it's going to likely dip at some point, even if you don't know when it will happen. Buy when people are selling and sell when people are buying(at a high and low point)
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:21:16
I would personally say no, don't mine on your PC, the reason for this is because you're only going to get like 1-2 dollars per day doing that, that doesn't even factor in your electricity costs to do such mining. Also, you're going to make your computer virtually unusable as far as I know. Do you want to still be able to do heavy things on your PC while it mines? like gaming or such.

This sucks and it's unfortunate but if you've invested already at a higher price and you're sitting on a loss, your only choice is to either sell and get out and be honest with yourself that you aren't going to re-enter into the market when it's up and lively again or just wait it out and distract yourself with other things in your life. It will go back up again at some point.
