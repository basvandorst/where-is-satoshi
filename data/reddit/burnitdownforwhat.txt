I believe LovelyDay was implying that SegWit will never be activated in Bitcoin and you're going to have to use Litecoin or some other altcoin if you want SegWit.  A nice quip really :)
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:05:58


I see this repeated over and over but I think it is wrong.  I think there are plenty of core devs and people who want blocksize increases even after segwit, but agreeing on exactly how to accomplish it is the only debate; meanwhile SegWit is ready to upgrade capacity today if miners would simply activate it.  That's why it would be nice to see SegWit in BU, but they are basically acting like babies simply to spite Core.
@_date: 2017-02-21 00:40:17
Interesting.  Are these aggregated ecdsa sigs large and would benefit from segwit as well?
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:32:45
Thanks for the reply.  I hadn't seen [Flexible Transactions]( and it is very interesting.  If SegWit fails, there is still hope for fungibility even if its other advantages are lost.

Pretty sure he has [St Kitts &amp; Nevis]( citizenship &amp; passport, which is available to anyone with enough money under their "economic citizenship" program, but that doesn't mean you have to give up your US citizenship.  No idea if he expatriated or not, and I don't really care either - that's his business, not mine.
And the US government locked him in a cage and permanently black-marked him as a felon at a young age for a made-up non-crime simply because he badmouthed the ATF regarding their deplorable actions in Waco, TX in a public forum where ATF fuckheads were present.  Would *you* work for the CIA after the US government did that to you?  It's just not believable, IMO.

This is a good point that I hadn't thought of before, but if the split is anywhere near 50%/50% both chains will be half the speed they were before and it will be all-out war.  Definitely better to keep BU's threshold at 75%+ if one wants it to have a better chance of winning.

For real - funny (because of the way it's put in the image, and because it's not me, but I can sympathize).
To What exchange do you buy on?  Have you ever heard of a limit order?  If your exchange is halfway decent, you can enter the amount you'd like to buy and the price you want to buy at, and the order sits there until the price drops to your desired buy-in point, then automatically executes.  No more timing the market based on feelings.

Maybe it's part of the release notes that are "still a bit in flux", but I thought I read that Compact Blocks were going to be a major feature of 0.14, though I don't see any main description of it in the notes.  I do see a few references to compact blocks in the specific fix lines - does this mean compact block transmission &amp; reconstruction is ready to go in 0.14?
This seems like a big deal for miners, and might pull some BU miners who are getting resource-saving gains from Xthin back onto the Core releases, so I really hope it is deployed in 0.14!
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:57:45
I'm having trouble following.  You're saying the CIA tapped Roger's communications via a FISA warrant and found something to blackmail him into bending Bitcoin to their whims by blocking its progress in terms of fungibility?
Since he's not a US citizen, why would they need a FISA warrant? Seems they'd just get the data from NSA or one of NSA's partners.
And wouldn't the CIA rather benefit from more anonymity in bitcoin for their nation-state toppling projects?
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:30:17


Could you possibly back that claim up with a credible, *actual proposal* from a core dev to change the POW?  I'm not saying it didn't happen and I don't examine every BIP, but the only ones even seriously suggesting this that I've encountered are people talking about if SHA256 ever becomes publicly broken or if quantum computers become available to anyone more than a handful of powerful entities, I've seen people suggest that at that point we would want to move to a quantum resistant algorithm.  Still, it's so far off there's no BIP (an actual proposal) afaiaw.

Correct me if I'm wrong but FlexTrans are being developed in Bitcoin Classic, not BU.  BU still has nothing that even resembles the good features of segwit (like flextrans... though there's a pointless SWHF BUIP with no support) nor do they plan to it seems.

AXA Group, an insurance and investment conglomerate, whose CEO is [chairman of the Bilderberg group](  Bilderberg has been an annual, invite-only, closed-door meeting between financial &amp; political elites and power brokers since the 1950s.  It is indeed disturbing that their tentacles have reached into Bitcoin, but it makes sense, because the traditional financial world is going to need to interact with bitcoin as well if they want to benefit from it like we all do, and also we don't know what terms the money was accepted on.  They may be pretty good, especially considering that what Blockstream develops is all open source and only builds the ecosystem around Bitcoin.
As for BU, who gave them $1.5 Million?  They won't tell us.  At least Blockstream is transparent.

This is why luke-jr's +17%/year HF proposal actually proposes a blocksize decrease if activated before April 2017.  It's a valid argument about decentralization, but not very tasty to most people since blocks are already full.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:22:58
They're obviously not, but this might be a better question for the people blocking off-chain transactions over at I've posed the [same question]( there multiple times.  A bunch of nonsense is spouted back mostly having to do with Flexible Transactions which isn't even proposed in BU.

@_date: 2017-03-26 22:20:34
I believe the argument against that currently is the dynamics of what is safe may change depending on whether SW is activated or not.  SW live will provide the testers with proper numbers for developing the safe HF.

Same story in the US with the Federal Reserve.  It is a private organization, a legal commercial entity whose [shareholders are the biggest private banks in the country](  It is no wonder [the fed committed 24 trillion USD]( to a bailout of the banking industry following the 2008 crisis, while the top Treasury official brokering the bailout was a former Goldman Sachs CEO (Henry Paulson, under Bush Jr).  After him, Obama's Treasury secretary was Tim Geithner, former head of the NY Fed, who he ran the bailout for.  The US survived from 1776 until 1913 without a central bank, whose Congressional [legislation was created in secret by the top US banks of the day]( and passed the US house on Christmas eve with very few congressmen present.  Within 10 years the Fed created the bubble that caused the roaring 20s, and then not only failed to prevent, but caused the great depression in the following decade when their bubble popped.  They've since failed the American people many times more.
 


In the US, the  holder of US Treasury debt is the Federal Reserve ([2.8 Trillion]( followed by [Japan at 1.1 Trillion and China (1 Trillion)](  The government is always out of money, so the Federal Reserve Notes that the Treasury prints and distributes to US banks are all "bought" from the Fed using US treasury debt denominated in USD, and drawn on the labor and trade of the people under the government's jurisdiction.
To top it all off, of those banks who own the federal reserve, the top 25 currently hold [242.9 TRILLION dollars (notional)]( (p36) in derivatives liabilities hidden off their balance sheet, while holding only 10 trillion in assets on their books.  And remember, derivatives are the things that made the whole system crash last time.  The Federal Reserve could have purchased every American home with a mortgage multiple times over for the cost of funding the bailout of the derivatives based on them, which caused the crisis.  These banks are in at least as bad a situation today, risk wise, as they were before the 2008 crisis, so history is bound to repeat itself.
Incidentally, a cool dude named Satoshi Nakamoto came up with an alternative system whose monetary policy is a slap in the face to central banks everywhere (mocking them for the crisis is literally embedded into the genesis block).  If we are to ever overthrow the vampiric, oligarchical system embedded in and controlling our government, Bitcoin is surely an essential tool in the path forward.

data_from_previous_block = the hash of the block being built upon, correct?
...and wouldn't it be:
SHA256(previous_block_hash + nonce_of_this_block + transactions to put in the block) = new block hash
So you're saying that if new_block_hash has enough zeros at the beginning, it's a valid block and the miner gets the block reward + fees, correct?
That all makes sense, thanks.  I'm still wondering how bitcoind determines the network's hash rate to determine what difficulty makes a valid block.
