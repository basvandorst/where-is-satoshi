Hello? Nobody sees what this is? This isn't them setting up a traditional exchange, this is them gearing up to release their own Crypto. I knew they were gonna do this a long time ago. All the banks are going to do it.
They're going to create a backend system that pays merchants with their own Crypto. Every time you make a credit transaction you will be billed in Fiat at the time of the transaction but the actual backend transaction will be done in Crypto. This will make their own Cryptos gain value without anyone knowing why, except those who know something about it.
Tell me I'm wrong.

Bitcoin C(r)ash
I'm convinced now that Roger Ver is a child that never grew up. I've been trading stocks for quite a while, and while I haven't actually traded any Crypto yet (but I'm up a lot on trading Crypto stocks) any fool who's been around can see what this is. This is a classic pump and dump, with added flavor. The added flavor is that the exchange actually stopped allowing sell orders after allowing a ton of buying. This has the effect of artificially jacking up the price. Roger actually went in on this, with the slimeballs from the Wall Street circuit. How could he be this much of a hypocrite?
My guess is that there will be a huge dump, in the middle of the night (if not sooner) and BCH will crash hard, leaving a ton of newbies holding the bag. Welcome to my world. I just find it amazing that the BCH crowd is acting like this wasn't set up in advance or something. It's called "Fast Money" for Christ's sake. They're about to take you fools to the cleaners.

I know that a lot of people want this to be fake but it probably isn't. Why? Because Amazon is never using PayPal. Also, after watching everyone attempt to destroy Kyle Bennett's reputation over the Intel/AMD deal (and he also predicted Raja leaving AMD over a year ago) I actually give credence to certain rumors now, and this is one of them.

Last I heard they're putting a crypto mine here. Electrical contractors are gearing up for it.

Lots of detractors on here now, defending banks even. Mind boggling. What that says to me is that somebody is scared. Really scared.

This. And others. He's telling you that banks are an integral part of society that create stability and fairness and only "fuck up" because people run them. Basically saying that a crypto dominated world would be chaos and for proof of that you only need to look at third world countries.
A couple things here:
What planet does he live on?
And you notice how nobody ever talks about "The Second World"?

This thread is loaded with bank shills. That is very interesting.

I've been seeing more and more of it lately. Call me paranoid...

Not for nothing, but am I the only one that sees the writing on the wall for this? If you want to eliminate your competition, what do you do? You make them illegal, thus illegitimate.
This is a setup for one of two things (or both):
1.) State issue Crypto.
2.) Bank issued Crypto.
Name recognition is everything with Crypto. Citicoin coming to an ATM near you.

Keep dreaming.

Like I stated on another thread, this looks like a setup for two things:
1.) State issued Crypto.
2.) Bank issued Crypto.
Too much of a coincidence that this announcement coincides with the top that Goldman called.

Well I knew this was gonna happen sooner or later. But, as usual, the Russian Govt attaches a bunch of nonsensical rules to it.
Next up: Bank issued Crypto.

You're delusional. Most banks are nothing but parasites and thieves now. The only relatively honest ones are the smaller ones and that's why they're smaller. Lemme guess, though, you work for one right?
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:03:13
Only a matter of time before they tried something like this. Bank issued Crypto is next.

It's about dam time but I wouldn't hodl my breath.
I live in Buffalo and we don't see one electron coming from the Niagara Falls (Robert Moses) power project. It all goes downstate and to other states for sale. I don't think people realize how screwed up NY's bureaucracy really is.

I think that you're correct to a certain degree. As long as the current financial system is in place, and legal tender is the standard, then this will be somewhat true. The real problem doesn't lie with the purported original mission of the banks, which is to create value and profit from it, it lies in their new mission to extract as much value form anything and everything that they can and either hoard it or pass it on to their "employees" and "stakeholders" (hoard it). This has been going on for a long time, and I'm old enough to remember when we really took the turn to predatory banking (the 1980's).
Bitcoin turns that model on its head, to a certain degree, for the banksters. They're stuck in a catch 22 situation where the only way to win at the bitcoin game is to play it. They can't ban it because it lives anywhere the internet does. They can't devalue it because they would need to accumulate enough of it to sway its value in the open market and that at this point would require a massive outlay of capital and resources to do so. The way I look at it, they only have one real option going forward.
And that's to start mining Bitcoin themselves (while there's still some left to mine) and also to issue their own cryptos (as I've stated before but no one will respond to it). Bitcoin is all about usage, right? The big banks have name recognition and massive access to capital. They could issue crypto that wasn't really worth much but then give it access to a credit account for transaction means. They already control the ATM networks. In other words, they could move credit transactions to the block chain and their Cryptos would start gaining value while  they simultaneously charged fees and interest on purchases made. Then when they accumulated enough Bitcoin they could then open up their ATM networks to Bitcoin transactions and make even more money.
I think that this is the inevitable future.  State actors could get in on the action as well, easily. But I also think that most of them will shoot themselves in the foot by resisting it as much as possible because they're dinosaurs, while a select number of newer, more forward thinking banks will jump in on it and make a killing. Evolution in a nutshell.
