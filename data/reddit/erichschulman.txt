Fair point. Wanna help me out though? I'm new to reddit

I think there's a reason (that I don't know). But, I think it's more complicated than the underlying technology.

Again I value the dollar because every April I need dollar bills to pay the government taxes. This is a really important point.
If Bitcoin's value had to do with your domestic currency's strength then you would expect more Bitcoin usage in countries with unstable/undeveloped financial systems. In practice, these countries prefer services like M-Pesa.
All this being said, I do think there is a good theoretical reason why  Bitcoin has a non-zero price. I don't think it's subjective. I don't think it's has value because other people say it does (because that would mean there is a bubble).

I am also confident that I can (and for the foreseeable future) exchange Bitcoin for fiat money; I just don't know why.

Poe wrote on both.
In all seriousness, I think there's an answer. I just wanted to see what other people thought

I would trade a loaf of bread for a 5 dollar bill because every April I need dollar bills to pay the government taxes.
I would trade the gold bars for bread because I can use the gold to make circuits or jewelry.
I'm unclear why I would accept Bitcoin (however, I feel like there is a reason).

It is possible people accept Bitcoin purely because they think other people do. However, this would mean Bitcoin's price is purely speculative. 
Personally, I don't think this is the case. However, I don't have good justification.
