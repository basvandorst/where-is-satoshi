Go to Tools, select "Export Private Keys", then select "Do not password protect export file".
That's it. :)

This just looks like an advertisement for your blog :)

If you're afraid of malware, burn a linux LiveCD for them.
Ask them to generate paper wallet on the clean LiveCD environment. That's it. :)
@_date: 2015-06-06 07:10:01
I think it can be done. I just doubt if any bitcoiner would love to use it. :)
@_date: 2015-06-20 05:41:59
Different people can have different opinions. :)
@_date: 2015-06-22 08:33:37
Oh I like using Linux :)
@_date: 2015-06-03 11:17:01
If I were you, I'd ask them to make a paper wallet. AND use the phone to monitor the balance.
@_date: 2015-06-11 11:52:32
Thanks for sharing! BTW, was the date 6/7/2014 really correct?
@_date: 2015-06-10 08:52:30
I'm sure users will be given enough time to upgrade their client prior to the fork. They don't need to do it within a particular 10 minutes time frame.
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:41:11
Yes Bitcoin should be a good investment for Greeks.
@_date: 2015-06-15 14:32:58
Are you sure you are posting on the correct sub? :)
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:34:48
Glad to see improvement has already been made.
Thanks for bringing up this issue anyway :)
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:42:05
Not sure if it's really impossible but my crazy guess is Bitcoin price will be back to the previous high of around $1200 in 2015.
@_date: 2014-12-27 16:40:53
Very great and informative analysis. Nice!
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:12:53
Sincerely wish you success! But may I know how many merchants in Venezuela is now accepting Bitcoins? Without local merchant supports, Bitcoins can still hardly to overtake fiat there.
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:31:18
Please give us some more hints how we can check on our own if our addresses are vulnerable or not.
@_date: 2014-11-20 15:08:31
LastPass + 2FA is still my best choice. Will try Encryptr only if it has 2FA
@_date: 2014-12-11 11:12:08
Bill Gates finally sees the true power of Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 14:06:49
Try blockchain.info first. It's the most basic one and you can set 2FA to protect your account. Remember also to backup your private keys....  then you are safe enough for normal use.
@_date: 2014-12-25 06:30:57
Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2015-05-11 05:39:09
Thanks for bringing this out to let more people aware of managing their passwords carefully :)
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:18:48
Bitbargain is definitely an exchange.
Just like NYSE, you don't buy stocks directly from the owner of NYSE. And NYSE doesn't need to use its own "pool" of money to trade with you.
@_date: 2015-05-20 05:44:57
I think the main problem why people don't trust new exchanges is that people are afraid the owner will run away with their coins one day.
So if you do have the skills, I'd suggest you to develop a truly decentralized exchange instead.
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:43:33
This is a great idea. I think if you don't do it now someone else may already start thinking to do it first. :)
@_date: 2015-05-16 13:22:56
We don't need any government function in bitcoin economy at all.
@_date: 2014-11-20 13:56:49
Wider use of bitcoin can help promote this crypto currency. So more organizations use it the better :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:20:39
Just hope that you can get your funds back from the banks soon
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:28:14
I'm no expert but I think it's possible... just for off-chain transactions
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:15:08
If you don't want to download the full blockchain, try Electrum or Multibit
@_date: 2015-01-09 06:30:45
Thank you! Hope my input is useful to you :)
@_date: 2015-01-16 11:15:19
I wish I could come to NY to meet you but London is quite far away from it :)
Anyway thanks for the offer. You're so nice.
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:49:22
Who was the miner confirmed this transaction?
@_date: 2015-05-09 05:53:34
I don't know what should be the best block size, I just know that the best size will change with time and so this block size debate will never end :)
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:10:50
You're welcome. Glad that it can help :)
@_date: 2015-01-28 02:34:36
Please help me forget the mtgox first

Let's ban David Cameron!

One of the good uses of altcoins is to help bring more people to get into crypto.
Once those new people enter the crypto world, they will quickly understand Bitcoin is the strongest one. And then they will become bitcoiners.
This was also how I entered the crypto world a year ago. I knew doge first and then truly love Bitcoin.
I'm quite disappointed there are still many people hate altcoins in this sub. They just don't seem to have enough confidence about Bitcoin which will be the ultimate winner of the game. :)
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:20:36
Good work and thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:34:40
Nice... the only problem is I don't have enough BTC to buy a lunch in my city :)
@_date: 2015-01-25 14:43:38
My son did it... using my Bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-05-04 07:28:23
One more plus - extremely low transaction fees specially when transferring big amounts.
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:22:47
Happy Tuesday... The only problem is I'm late
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:12:24
1st: It is your encrypted wallet file.
2nd: Yes you better back this up.
3rd: As far as I know there is nothing you can back up here.
You can't recreate this multisig wallet on coinkite or green address directly with these backups. You can, however, try to use a swipe tool to access your funds if copay becomes offline.
@_date: 2015-05-17 06:46:46
There are still many other probabilities. Say 19k is the same and 1k is different, or 10k the same and 10k different, or many other combinations provided that the sum is 20k.
@_date: 2015-04-22 06:09:49
I'll give away bitcoin licenses to non-profit organizations
@_date: 2015-04-20 18:14:11
What a cool project :) Thank you for the information.
@_date: 2015-04-06 03:08:56
It seems you will need to pay only if you use Tor to create your account. If you create account without Tor and then use Tor to login, you don't have to pay then.
@_date: 2015-04-10 07:21:13
I think it basically should not require more than 1 confirmation. The service provider doesn't seem to understand Bitcoin very much.
@_date: 2015-04-17 11:48:03
Nice story. 
Glad to hear you enjoy your trip. Thanks Satoshi too. :)
@_date: 2015-04-13 08:44:58
I did use Google Adwords before and it appeared they did approve Ads manually.
But I haven't used it again for a long time. They may have changed their approval procedure. I'm not sure.
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:14:09
How could Google AdWords team approve this Ads?
@_date: 2015-04-08 06:17:35
The sub you mentioned should already be a good one.
You may also try to post your requests here:
@_date: 2015-04-11 09:35:13
I heard from this sub that someone has already started running it in Philippines. I'm not sure about Mexico, though.
@_date: 2015-04-14 10:24:28
It works for me now :)
@_date: 2015-04-10 07:13:48
When will it be available? I think I'll download it to give it a try :)
@_date: 2015-04-23 09:17:46
I keep most of my Bitcoins on my PC as cold storage, and keep tiny on my phone as a hot wallet.
So using multiple wallets is actually the best way if you want to keep a couple Bitcoins safely.
@_date: 2015-04-15 07:29:10
Good. Thank you for the code.
@_date: 2015-04-18 15:28:10
You can actually collect something because of the blockchain technology. And this is really revolutionary. :)
@_date: 2015-04-19 10:45:33
Are you really Satoshi Nakamoto? :)
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:58:05
Good to see more updates :)
@_date: 2015-03-03 09:39:42
That's cool. Waited for it for a long time. Good job!
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:55:57
I'd just store in a paper wallet.

Useful information. Thanks for posting this excellent guide.
@_date: 2015-02-12 11:39:25
There are really lots of potential applications for blockchain technology. It just takes some time for these applications to become a reality.
@_date: 2015-02-04 08:18:33
Not really impossible but I'm interested to know which government/bank would spend this budget without public known
@_date: 2015-02-07 13:40:49
So excited... I mean before I click into this thread and find out it is only for Canada
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:06:48
Why only ban Mycelium wallet but not the other crypto wallets?
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:39:53
No, my bank is happy with it.
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:14:37
One of the key advantages of accepting payments in Bitcoin is that all transactions are irreversible. 
If you accept PayPal instead, you may need to worry about chargebacks.
@_date: 2015-02-23 04:03:34
Change the gap limit to 100, then restart and you'll have 100 addresses shown on your offline wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:16:21
Bitcoin is not pegged to the dollar.
And never will.
