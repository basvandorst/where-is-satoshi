All crypto currencies have benevolent dictators except one. I think you are missing the point, not having leaders is what makes this experiment different. 
Monetary policies were constrained by nation states policies. Nation states can not have several optional policies at the same time so people pick one leader and follow, those who disagree have to wait.  I think we are progressing towards a world where main states will not be able to dictate monetary policy and will compete with private money in the form of crypto currencies. The most important factor for long term is immutability of the rules under attacks from others and from self serving leaders.

You can double spend way after that with different tactics
1 - buy coffee, go out of Starbucks, double spend 5 minutes after the fact with a higher fee. The miner can include any of both tx, with an incentive to include the latter (more fees).  There is no risk.
2 - buy fridge during a high-fee period, send below-market fee, tx is not included in the following blocks. double spend with higher fee 5 hours later.

maybe these channels are offchain private deals (lines of credit) between two partners.   They work as wormholes that connect different areas of the LN space.  If this deal is broken by the partners, users that route payments through them are  financially unaffected (money is returned to them) . I can certainly see that working.

The point is that 1M bitcoin is a finite amount and they can not create more money.  
TPTB are way past the stage where they own lots of money (kings) , they realized that debts can only yield so much (private bankers) and in 1970's they figured out a way to create money at a higher rate than the prices (private bankers owning reserve currency)
At some point they will spend that 1M bitcoin but they will have to provide some value to society to recoup it, they will have to EARN it.

well, that is exactly what is not happening, the second transaction was included in the block and the first one was invalidated.  I thought BCH has some -lame probably- way to prevent it , but that is not the case.
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:23:46
First: I could not care less about BCH blockchain and only went to the site thinking it was a BTC doublespend detection site.
I assume they collect tx being sent to the mempool that have outputs already used by other tx in the mempool and they declare "winner" to the tx finally included in a block.  The timestamp of the tx can be arbitrary if they are too close in time (since it would depend on the propagation route) but in some cases there are several minutes of difference.
I don't care it a particular transaction was not an attempt to fraud or just a fee bump, the point is that the BCH and the BTC blockchain can be gamed to include doublespends.  But BTC users are warned that 0 conf transactions are dangerous while BCH tries to push a narrative where they are perfectly fine and should be a major use case, which is -as many other things in their universe- bullshit
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:01:21
 [
@_date: 2018-09-14 15:10:24
I saw that, but anyways: What prevents the second transaction to send coins to another address? Does BCH have code to block that? and even if they do, in this case the first output of the tx is being slightly decreased to increase the fee so in very strict way, is a double spend.
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:38:33

My new catchphrase 
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:07:54
Let me get this straight. In BTC a miner can choose to include any valid tx as long as it does not spend past or current block used outputs.  The intention of the tx is irrelevant:  fee bumps are double spends.
I don't know BCH but I can not imagine any (non-lame) way to prevent this in a BTC-type blockchain. A miner can always say that "I included this tx because I didn't see the other tx" 
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:26:03
The network splits, people is told all over the place to stop using the network, nodes and miners shutdown after 2 hours and 5 blocks the bug is found, miners patch their software and offending blocks are orphaned, but as their txs are also included in the good blocks there are no double spends. Patched nodes and miners are restarted.

Bug is hidden so deep and for so long that there is no network split when is exploited, but independent blockchain analysis watchtowers detect the inflation, after one day the bug is discovered and patched, patched nodes split the network apart from the offending block: a total of 240 blocks are orphaned. All valid transactions are replayed by watchtowers in the valid chain, conflicting transactions are resolved by miners usually by fee so double spends during that day are valid.

Actually, my theory is that Bitmain wanted to freeze the protocol not because of segwit but because they didn't want malleability to be solved. Malleability enabled second layer solutions (LN) and potentially can enable "unfairly cheap" transactions.
Segwit was a blocksize increase but also contained the death pill (solved malleability) for them.
Asicboost was maybe a secondary reason for blocking segwit.

IIRC there were lots of empty blocks mined by Antpool in 2016-17. A miner is leaving money on the table by mining empty blocks. One reason could be that they wanted to increase fees (by filling up the mempool), the other reason could have been usage of covert asicboost. I'm leaning towards the first reason, specially because there is evidence of filling up blocks with spam, indicating that the perpetrator didn't care about wasting money in fees to impose his views
Overt asicboost do not interfere with segwit, as you can see in the OP.
Overt blocks uses bits on the header that were used for signalling protocol changes/versions during the blocksize war.  I think I've read that overt asicboost does not interfere with all of them

Plan B - Suddenly withdraw BTC hashing power right after a retarget with the price at lows, creating a downward spiral (blocks take longer, etc..). That would not help BCH but in the long weeks before the diff adjustment they can try the flippening with a 51% attack
Plan C - Good ol'  51% attack . Destruction of all cryptos
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:00:22
good read, what I think you are missing it the fact that they expected a flippening this year but BCH failed to gain traction, leaving Jihan and Ver alone sustaining the currency price and also the mining.  So the gameplan was to get closer to BTC price and then attack, but it seems that they failed.  They were (I think dedalnix was) talking about some "upcoming event"  a couple of months ago, back then I interpreted it was a 51% attack (if it is going to happen it will happen right after difficulty retarget)
Something that I will never understand is why people would buy a coin that is so obviously backed by just one entity. I'd rather buy lottery tickets.

ok, I see now, you describe a definitive fork with no merge in sight. The bad miners will have the longest chain by far, but it will not be valid for the majority of nodes. Good nodes will reject transactions if they are not valid with the shorter (valid) chain. Bad miners' nodes (yes, they have nodes too...) will accept "invalid" transactions though (and may not forward them) creating a network split.
In this scenario how wallets will decide which network is the correct one if no human intervention is possible?  Now I see wallets more important than nodes.

A downward spiral effect can be caused by hashpower being retired as price drops, thus longer block times and higher fees which pushes price further down and other rounds of hashpower withdrawal. That effect can dramatically accelerated if Bitmain tries to attack BTC by removing hashpower on purpose.  The effect lasts only until the next difficulty adjustment that can take months.

Miner efficiency is measured by hash/joule. The amount of SHA256^2 hashes that 1 joule of energy produced.
There is a theoretical maximum Hash/Joule ratio.
Each next generation of miners, increase that number (more hashes per joule) but the ratio of increment decreases with each generation as they approach to the theoretical limit.
Eventually the efficiency difference between all miners will stall, sha256^2 ASICs will be trivial to implement or even open sourced and the mining equation will be dominated by electricity price, which will take us to the land of mining decentralization

I agree: The health bar would be on the seller side. The "available funds"  should be on the wallet side.

Paypal has 150M accounts.
You need a small stash to operate with bitcoin (keep some coin on the cell phone or so)
Bitcoin will reach 100M users and they will have 100 USD in stash, that is 10B market cap.
80% of the coin will be used as long term saving/hedge/lost coin
So, if 10B is 20%, total market cap ~ 50B -&gt; price ~ 2500 USD.

quoting myself here. Due to this minor inconvenience, people should always have a *mínimum balance* on their bitcoin wallets just in case they need to spend right away and later on replenish from coinbase/whatever.
The sum of all "mínimum balances" of all bitcoin wallets allows the price of a bitcoin to be reasonably high even if bitcoin is not used as unit of account (prices of goods still in USD) and fails to be a store of value.
The market value of Bitcoin used only as "payment network" is number_of_users * average_mínimum_balance. 
I've seen this effect of "credit creation" in prepaid cell cards, prepaid bus cards, gift cards, etc. In all those cases you are lending money at 0% to the issuer.

On a standard fiat transaction there are hidden variables that the seller does not know and force him to make a leap of faith when accepting traditional means of payment: compromised credit cards, fake bills, checks with insufficient funds, etc.

Everything contributes. I hope your prediction is true and your favorite corporation or government launches a cryptocurrency and it becomes mainstream. We only need it to be fungible and pseudoanonymous like bitcoin.
This way we will not have to use Coinbase or exchanges to buy/sell bitcoin to newfiat as there will be trustless blockchain conversion services like Ver's. People will be used to conversion and will learn to go to the most deflationary currency. Guess what.
And maybe at some point your favorite corporation/goverment will find an excuse to unilaterally modify the supply of the mainstream cryptocurrency. If that happens, bitcoin will prevail, if that does not happen then goverments will have to adhere strictly to fixed supply so there will be no free money for anyone. Goal achieved.

The alert must identify offending transaction. Checking that is super fast
@_date: 2016-01-06 12:26:40
I assume miners always check their own mempool but they might not check (the transactions of) the previous block to start hashing on top of it as it takes precious time.  As a security measure they probably check the transactions in parallel and switch to hash on top of the previous block if they discover inconsistencies on the transactions.
What about nodes broadcasting alerts when a solved block has invalid transactions?  cheating miners can stop mining on them immediately.

3 - ASIC primers: You need to know how to make chips

5 - ASIC efficiency: You need contacts to make very efficient chips 
6 - Energy: You only need access to cheap energy, chips are cheap. This is the End game.

Look at the nation states situation: fiscal deficits all over the place. Is this sustainable as a global phenomenon?
If your answer is no, then it follows that it must be corrected , but it's becoming evident for me that democracy is not compatible with making sacrifices to reduce fiscal deficits, majorities just give a f to rational explanations and basic arithmetic, they are like toddlers screaming for pudding where there is no pudding left.
So nation states close the deficit either by money printing and/or taxing wealth (taxing stock not only flows)

To clarify: They are talking about SW in LTC with Xinxi (LTC developer) and partially disclosing their strategy in the upcoming SW activation for Bitcoin.
They mention that there is a "secret" economic problem for them if SW is activated via soft fork. My interpretation is: SW harmed their patented covert asicboost advantage implemented in their chips
The excuses they use to justify this weird attitude are:
- fees will be "unfairly cheap" if all transactions are moved to 2nd layer. 
- soft forks leave technical debt on the codebase (somewhat true)
@_date: 2019-10-25 12:27:34
I challenge privacy is the unique selling proposition. Ability to hide wealth/flows and avoid losing value through inflation is also important.
 For a successful currency you need economic support. Privacy is attractive for big money only if you can hide wealth from taxes, otherwise you get Tor or PGP. Heck, we only got TLS because big money wanted their websites to be secure.
I'm not advocating tax evasion, I'm just saying why a few anchors are betting on bitcoin (I'm not talking about speculators but hodlers): There are no tax havens left in the world, big money is looking desperately for alternatives.

I'm not very good with words, what I tried to say is that there are more incentives than privacy to use bitcoin and those extra incentives come from unsustainable fiscal [policies.

There will be reactions to these attacks and Bitcoin is one of several pressure relieving valves.

I hear you. 
Deficit spending and nation state control of the economic cycle through monetary policy is what I'm against in the first place. This is the reason why I support bitcoin/crypto even if I'm not an investor.
Not only deficit spending will be dead. If the fiat system is abolished and a pseudonymous crypto takes it place, it will become harder for nation states to collect taxes on flows/income. They will slowly transition to land/resource-based tax similar to Georgism.  The result for the consumer is that things that require natural resources will be more heavily taxed and services will probably be cheaper to buy.  
That does not mean that working will not be well paid: it means it  will not be taxed (better paid and still cheaper than now), more people will be willing to work if there is no tax involved.
 The result for the corporations is neutral I think : land/resources will be heavily taxed so their margin will depend on your efficiency to use less land/energy/carbon quota/water/waste recycling/shoreline/ports/RF spectrum/etc... Just think what this kind of taxation system can do for Mother Earth.

It is working now, but would you bet it will work flawlessly in the next 20 years ?  Any hiccup will trigger diversification measures, I think bitcoin is one of those diversified assets.

I tried to express a line of reasoning of what would happen to nation states funding if Bitcoin wins and is used as a normal currency.  Can you point me where in my line of reasoning I'm derailing?
@_date: 2019-10-06 15:57:55
**We are at war**
I know this is going to be a long war:  States vs individuals. Statists will fight fiercely to control of the income, activity and ,left unchecked, basically all aspects of the life of individuals. The result of this war is still uncertain but history is on our side: individual freedom will find a way.
There are many aspects of this war, but here we focus on the economic part. Nation states took the responsibility of regulating the economic cycle to avoid recessions and in the name of that sacred mission they created narratives that allow them to do almost anything, it worked pretty well for a number of years, maybe due to economic elites choosing candidates, but now populist leaders are popping up everywhere and out of control of the elites, it is very hard to curb spending for a populist government because their power resides on basically giving out things for free so for them it's either debasing/debt or increase taxes.  
It all started with voluntary debt and as the states have money printing machines this seemed a sure bet for people measuring their wealth in fiat. Of course the balance sheet looks different if measured against something like land (fixed) or global GDP (expanding but way less than monetary base).
Debasing/debt is just a way to extract money from the suckers that think they will retire with fiat-related savings and pension funds. Suckers think on their wealth in dollars and think inflation will be under control for the rest of their life. Elites accumulate in assets and consider fiat just a means not an end, Of course they also play the casino game very well so they are OK with Bonds, QE or even MMT. They will sell the part of their wealth still in fiat way before the suckers and their pension funds when/if things start to collapse.  
Stocks are a different beast because some of them will survive inflation episodes. Picking the right ones and choosing a good timing to buy seems hard though.
What we are seeing now is that statists are out of control debasing the currencies, the money flows and quickly settles in static low rent pockets and that is why we are not seeing inflation: it is not triggering economic activity anymore as most of it is saved for the future. The existence of negative interest rates bonds is very telling: There is no escape to the fiat system. Real estate is too risky for the reasons I will explain on the tax section.
Crypto, in particular Bitcoin, appears as an option for this lack of freedom. If crypto wins the war the states will not be able to debase their fiat currency anymore as every penny printed will create inflation.
**Income Tax and crypto**
Elites hate taxes on wealth and prefer taxes on income/spending as they are already rich. They lobbied for centuries to design the tax system for their convenience. They still need nation states but they don't want to pay for them. In addition taxing income/spending is way harder than taxing property/assets so the tax code ended up being extremely complex: they have the best lawyers / accountants to find loopholes and pay even less than their share on that.
The statists think they can get away with just taxing income and they are closing all the gaps by creating global entities to control money laundering and tax havens and ultimately they will try to eliminate cash.  
Crypto poses a risk to this goal as society will be able to hide complete layers of economic activity from the eyes of the tax collectors.  If crypto succeeds and becomes commonplace all the personal services (contractors, gardeners, plumbers, maids, accountants, lawyers) will prefer to be paid in crypto. Corporations will be better off outsourcing work to smaller companies that would be more able to dodge the taxman more efficiently, the trend will continue upwards taking over more and more layers.
Taxing wealth will also be a challenge also as the states will not be able to size the crypto-wealth of individuals or corporations. At least they will be able to size real estate and other assets, and that leads us to:
**The endgame: Georgism and a better planet**
If crypto wins this war, statists will find it hard to fund the nation states services using debasing or taxing income so they will resort to something different, and if you think a little bit, very fair :  Tax natural resources.
Natural resources such as land, water, air, minerals, energy, radio frequency permits, shoreline usage, sea/river ports, roads, pollution permits, killing animals permits and I'm sure statists will find others.  All these taxes are almost trivial to collect compared to the declarative income tax.
I know they are taxing them now, but now think on really high taxes to support the dwindling income tax.
Of course, corporations will pass these taxes to the consumer so if you drink Coke you will pay for the taxes on land usage of the Coca Cola plant, the water usage, the waste management, and so on. In the end the price structure of all goods and services will reflect the usage of natural resources.
There will be entire categories of things that will become more expensive due to their usage of natural resources that now are "subsidized" (cough, cough oil...) .  On the other hand all personal services will become cheaper from the consumer point since the service-performers will not pay income tax. 
People will not be able to accumulate real state as investment, this will create selling pressure and cheaper land, all land will be used for something.
It will be almost impossible to evade taxes under this schema although the elites will lobby to influence in the tax rates for the different categories.  Everbody and their mothers will access tax havens (i.e. crypto wallets)
This scenario gives me hope for the planet

If it all works as planned, from the standpoint of a noob user LN wallet is just a checking account, while BTC wallet would be an investment account.
This is what you say to a noob:
You send BTC paying "a couple dollar fees max" to your LN wallet, after one hour you are able to use those funds to pay any node in the LN, you pay less than cents for those payments.  You can add / remove funds from your LN wallet to your main BTC wallet, it takes one hour and "another couple dollars fees". Sometimes things might go wrong and you will have to wait 24 hours for some funds to be recover but you will never lose control of the funds.
Under the hood things are more complicated:
The selection of partners, the route discovery , combination of channels to execute one payment, rebalancing of channels, reclaiming stranded funds. All these things must be automatically done by the wallet IMO.

I don't think bitcoin needs me to change my attitude. When talking with nocoiners I tend to talk about all use cases, for example 
BTC LN will be competitive for day to day transactions and micro transactions, 
Lerner thing will be good for smart contracts, 
Maxwell thing will make it competitive for fungibility/anonymity
These  "will be" and "competitive" words  means BTC doesn't have it yet and other might also have it.
I believe there will be only one store of wealth currency and I think BTC is way ahead the rest, including fiat/gold/real state of course

The exploit was also independently discovered by a team of guys, I read the paper some time ago. Somebody in the know told me these two guys "sold the patents" to an unknown buyer (he refuses to give names).  
Also Jihan stated several times he wants Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash to be independent. i.e. not using the name of Bitcoin for BCH.
Also Jihan announced this attack right after he signed NYA. He said that if for any reason the 2nd part of NYA (2X) is not activated he will move his hashpower to bitcoinABC (His "devs" didn't even finish downloading bitcoin source code when he said that)

Bitcoin main use case is "store of wealth" ,  Libra main use case is "transactions".
Regarding storing wealth on Libra:
Libra is backed by currencies and bonds. Currencies are being debased and bond yields these days are negative in terms of inflation, on top of that the monetary policy of Libra is not clear and might very well be abused (think QE but now without any restriction because you are a private entity)

I think you are right. They want a SHA256 ALT so they can use their mining technology (including ASICBoost advantage). They want to have an alternative business if SHA256 is deprecated in bitcoin.  There are also some advantages: if another player (gov) attacks bitcoin with a 51% attack, they can orphan the attack by redirecting BCH miners. I'm assuming Jihan holds BTC as well as BCH.

Let's assume this exists and works as advertised, these are the things to consider :
**1 - Capital cost**
Buying the miner vs buying a heating system
I would assume the miner is much more expensive.
**2 - Running costs**
Monthly expenditure to keep your house warm
For the miner:  Mining earnings - Electricity.
For the heater:  0 - Natural Gas or Electricity 
(note the heat pumps are 30% more efficient than joule-based heaters)
**3 - Noise**
This depends on the design of the miner, There are silent but still efficient heat transfer methods
The standard heaters (natural gas / heat pumps) are also noisy.
**4 - Maintainability**
After a few iterations the miner (solid state) will be easier to maintain than a freaking heater with moving parts.
**5 - Convexity of the investment**
The heater will never give you profits, with the miner you at least have the possibility of high earnings.
**6 - Ideological Reasons / Talking point** 
After doing all the math, you might want the miner anyway.

On the other side if you have euros in cash and want to take them out of the country you can use bitcoin. A good opportunity but I doubt  that is a major use case, wealthy people were taking euros out for months using the regular methods.

More anonymity will bring nation-states to their doors, more smart-contracts-friendly opcodes will attack their business models, bitcoin maximalism will kill their other bets (most of them are multi-coin), as per the miners: I don't know what they are thinking, buy it might be that they think they "own" the bitcoin network

I guess he will be mining asicboost for a few minutes until the number of tx/fees is enough to switch to SW (i.e. more txs).  Now that I think of it, block subsidy is so high compared with fees that this choice will have to be made after a couple of halvings.

Not an expert, but I think it would be like this:
Wallet will show your two accounts: onChain balance (the one we know) and LN Balance.
You will be able to transfer btc between those two accounts, it will take some confirmations (let's say 1 hour). You pay relatively expensive onchain fees.
You go to the merchant site or POS and you'll be shown a QR code (or RFID)
The wallet will detect if the QR is onChain or LN, it will check if you have enough balance in the corresponding account and display a prompt to approve the transaction. If it is a LN transaction you pay cheap fees and is instant (merchant immediately receives LN balance)
If you want to receive bitcoin, your wallet will ask you if you want to receive them onChain or on LN.  LN will be instant.

current taxes might be in favor of RE (basically because makes you part of a large collective of people that will get angry at higher taxes on that) 
But in a hopefully possible future where nation states have trouble controlling citizens' money flows. Sales and income taxes will become more difficult to collect (will rely more on honesty than paper trails or proof, which gives unfair advantages to cheaters) , then nation states will be tempted to tax capital and usage of natural resources such as RE , usage of roads, Radio Frequency, CO2, water usage, etc..

On the bright side we are moving forward as species, from worse to best in the following list:  alpha-male pack of chimpanzees, caste system (based on birth rights), capitalism and free market where finally all violence is eliminated and meek put their price to their efforts.

When the fees dominate the miner's profits you will have a free market selling mining confirmations. The energy spent will be paid by the people paying for their confirmations (i.e. no speculation).

**Environment** 
Not only the tech has improved, the environment is well better now that all these altcoins, ICOs and anti-bitcoin actors as are revealed.
Hash rate is better distributed now,  Jihan never controlled the amount of hash I personally thought he controlled  (I thought he had &gt; 51%) 
Difficulty adjusting down relatively slowly (as its happening now) is another risk averted. A sudden stop could slow bitcoin down to a halt. Now we know there is 6T hashes of potential hashrate, even though only 4T are running, the remaining 2T will only be triggered when price is up or accumulated fees are substantive

If I'm not mistaken Jihan laid out a public plan before the activation of segwit saying that if the 2X part of the agreement is not respected then he will put his miners on a 2X hard fork, I think he even mentioned BitcoinABC. A couple days after that announcement Ver came out with his BCH. It seems obvious to me that they wanted to hard fork first to eliminate the fear of HF and be a valid known alternative (read threat) to receive bitmain hashpower if 2x does not happen. Also BCH is being sustained by bitmain hashing at a loss.  Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:44:39
Another possibility I think it was mentioned before when there was not segwit/2x on sight is that all scaling will be offchain and that would mean that probably the 2nd layer will become dominated by the existing financial system+ a few new players. Bitcoin will be used as settlement between them, fees will be expensive, lots of drama and discussions about satoshi's vision, coffees will not be served, etc.
Still bitcoin will be deflationary and a relatively safe store of value, even if you only have IOU, and money will not be created by board of directors under lobby pressures.
EDIT: I'm intrigued by the BCH miners attacking the bitcoin network. How do you think they can sustain their hashrate in the long term if they stay at the cheap chain?

Bitcoin is only removing one function: the manipulation of the economic cycle through monetary policy. All the other functions of the states remain untouched.
There is a couple of side effect on how will those state operations will be funded:
1 - Seniorage is one of their income sources and it will be unavailable. 
2 - Taxes on money flow (for example income tax) will be more difficult to enforce. Eventually the state will have to rely on charging their own services and tax only registered property (real estate, cars, permits, etc.). I personally think taxing property is much more progressive than taxing income. I suspect taxing income is an invention of the elites.

amount of energy can be decreased by an equivalent of the "cold war arms race" or OPEC. As fees become more prevalent, the amount of money obtained by mining will slow down. Some miners will quit temporarily, leaving their miners in standby only to fire them up when :
A: the fees accumulate to make the bounty economical (raising hashrate based on fees) for them to mine. This is a negative feedback loop that effectively increases throughput.
B: if there is a 51% attack to the network (network attacked means their own bitcoins and miners will be worthless)

Inefficiency is on purpose. The fact that somebody has to spend energy is what makes it secure.

You will have to invest energy to mine, and that is the only thing you need (as  sha256**2 chips will be as common as calculators).

I understand that propagating blocks to all miners takes a few seconds. This is due to the fact that bitcoin network is peer to peer and intermediate nodes will delay the block propagation because they must verify, all than is in addition to transmission delays due to physical bandwidth and latency. 
so, larger blocks will take more seconds to propagate than smaller ones.  Those who are connected "same owner" with the block discoverer have a slight advantage to find the next block as they trust (no need to check) and they are physically closer so they will start mining right away (no propagation time).

This is going to resolve itself with time. The mining equation relies now on capital costs (sha256**2 asics are still a niche)
These asics are going to go down in price for at least one order of magnitude, and chip generations (12nm 7nm etc..) will be more and more spaced in time. 
So the mining equation will be dominated by cheap electricity, and that levels the play field for everyone.

I agree with you, but taxes are now based on money flow (income, vat, sales) and with a ubiquitous bitcoin flow of money will be easy to hide, flow of services is already easy to hide and flow of goods is somewhat harder specially import/export

I'm not an expert on this but I've been around enough to know that:
Bitcoin uses two independent algorithms SHA256 for hashing and ECDSA for public/private keys (encryption).
They can be independently attacked by quantum computers. Starting in 2012 I think most of the outputs are Pay to hash so in order to spend an output you will have to break both algorithms.
Satoshi's coins are very old so they can be "stolen" by breaking ECDSA  --&gt;  "The wallet attack"
Coin generation / deep reorgs can be attacked by breaking SHA256  --&gt; "The mining attack"
**Mining Attack**
The mining attack (breaking SHA256) can be averted pretty easy with a soft-fork changing the hashing algorithm. To honor the investment in mining and prevent fluctuations in the hashing power I would use a combination of SHA256 with some other quantum resistant algo, bitcoin now is
Hash = SHA256(SHA256(data))
It should be :
NewAlgorithm(SHA256(SHA256(data)))  or SHA256(SHA256(NewAlgo(data)))
**Wallet Attack**
A new Private/Public key algo should be developed and all outputs must be moved to these new Quantum resistant address. This can be also implemented in a soft - fork
The (minor) problem is the number of bitcoin keys that are lost during the first few years, including Satoshi's million bitcoin. All these bitcoins will be back to life and might generate a selling pressure. I guess it will depend on the rate at which the private keys are discovered by the quantum computers.

as per enforcement of income tax: "how are you paying for this house and those two cars and those two kids and all these consumer goods?"  is the kind of property tax I'm envisioning: you can only tax what you have or you spent, things that are visible to the state. Your real income will be invisible.  Kind of using your 401k for paying for your vacations, gardener, hairdresser, restaurants, netflix etc: suddenly everything is 30% cheaper.

\- The transaction malleability bug prevented an efficient implementation of Layer 2.
\- Layer 2 networks such as Lightning Network allow users to transfer bitcoin using a minimum number of on-chain (fee paying) transactions.
\- In the future miners will derive most of their income from fees. If L2 protocols are successful the blockchain will be used for few (relatively) expensive transactions, but Bitmain preferred the other way around: lots of cheap transactions (Bitcoin Cash style)
My opinion is that second layer networks are inevitable and if Bitcoin would not have implemented them another coin would have taken its place. So the devs actually protected bitcoiners by stubbornly resisting the coup. In this regard Bitmain was selfish and anti-bitcoin because they also produce miners for most alt-coins so they could not care less about this particular one (BTC). 
Other actors like Bitpay and even Vorhees realized that the role that a  BTC/LN world would give to intermediaries is very dry. All margins will be squeezed and their businesses will have to compete with millions of teenagers with Raspberries, open source payment portals and free nodes/wallets. They've found some temporary relief on multi-crypto markets and government regulation, but in a full crypto world that I envision those businesses will not exist anymore.  
Not to mention that in an alternate universe where Bitcoin Cash won the war, Bitmain would have proved that they have veto power for protocol decisions. That can't be good if you want to compete with nation states currencies, it makes your currency very easy to attack (for example now you can bribe/threat Jihan and you effectively control Bitcoin Cash protocol)

I still try to wrap my head around this mechanism. The problem is deficit spending.
Lincoln solution is debasing (gov printing money and giving it to itself directly without FED / ECB )
A non-monetary solution solution is debt (create bond, sell it to private investors)
This FED thing is in the middle: create debt and they buy it by printing money
One reason might be that the gov bonds can be bought by private investors and that helps "foot the bill" so the debasing is less dramatic.
Clumsy Summary of Gov Spending Options :
A - Lincoln debasement (benefit lower classes because a large portion of deficit is social programs)
B - UBI debasement (benefit all citizens )
C - buy bonds with QE  (benefit bond holders )
D - No Deficit / No monetary debasement  (benefit currency holders)
E - Private Debt Emission (benefit currency holders)

I don't know, probably Bitmain is making that money because they are using subsidized miners (at cost)
Option A : Let's say the cost is 4 coins per block, they are getting 12.5 now and keep 8.5. After halving they get 6.25 and keep 2.25. Supply did not change.
Option B: Cost is 8 coins, they get 12.5 now and keep 4.5. After halving they get 6.25 so they shutdown miners until difficulty goes down/price goes up. downward spiral ensues, they know this so they start saving bitcoins a few months before the halving (selling less) allowing them to keep mining at a loss for a while (killing competitors in the process) 
@_date: 2019-09-16 15:01:01
That is correct. Segwit fixed "transaction malleability" enabling simpler Layer 2 implementations.
Bitmain resisted the change because Layer 2 networks have the potential to eliminate certain on-chain transactions and the associated fees. Also fixing TM broke a secret Bitmain mining optimization.

Segwit is an optional protocol upgrade to increase the blocksize (more transactions per block =&gt; cheaper fees) that triggered a full-scale war that ended up with a fork known as Bitcoin Cash supported by some major players.  
A major mining company and a few gamblers thought that they were controlling Bitcoin and placed a major bet against the protocol change. Developers didn't bulge and the market gave them a complete victory, cementing the reputation of Bitcoin as "hard to manipulate"  which is much more important than "cheap to transact" in the eyes of the market at least.

number 3 does not make sense, does it?
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:17:40
There is an undeniable trend since July 25th.
There are two versions of asicboost: covert (cannot be  easily detected by inspecting the block) and overt (can be detected by inspecting the block header). The latter is compatible with segwit.
Asicboost was first [published]( and [patented]( by Timo Hanke and Lerner. 
Bitmain tried to patent it in China
Bitmain Asics were reverse-engineered and covert asic-boost circuitry was allegedly discovered
It is possible that Bitmain boycotted Segwit in 2017 because of his plan to secretly use covert asicboost
Hanke and Lerner sold their patent to Halong Mining
Halong Mining released it as an open defensive patent and uses it on their own miners
Asicboost now is used in ~5% of hashing rate.
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:19:00

@_date: 2018-04-19 13:33:37
Income tax is hard to collect and easy to lie about and because of that it inevitably will lead to a totalitarian information system that controls all our transactions and forbids the use of cash (or any bear carrying value like bitcoin).
Sales tax for products is somewhat more easy to collect because stores (physical or web based) can be raided. Also products are produced and they can be counted by the tax authority, so the tax it's harder to avoid.  
Sales tax for human  services is almost impossible to enforce and relies on people declaring them, again: unless they abolish cash and all other cash-like alternatives like bitcoin

I would expect a 10-20% improvement on a second iteration, but Asicboost alone should give you 18.5% and on top of that you have the 10nm efficiencies.  I can be wrong.

I would have thought that once you have your circuit designed, the process will either make it perfectly or wrong. You test it and if it does not fail then is QC passed.  New processes generate a larger number of QC fails , but the ones that pass the test should be performant
Clock and heat dissipation enter here because I guess that energy dissipation can only be confirmed once the ASICs are produced, you can have estimations based on the drawing board but the actual numbers come from testing. I think the companies, once they get a working prototype, they tweak the clock up/down to make sure the chips work at the maximum operative temperature. I might be wrong though

I don't think it is much effort. The miners just need to modify their software to support RSK but they will be paid.  They have to publish intermediate blocks (is there a name for half-cooked blocks?)  anyways if they are part of a pool (most of them are)
The other thing is that it is completely voluntary, if you are a miner are not forced to mine for them.
As per the soft fork, I didn't follow the latest developments, but I would think the "commit to main chain" method should not be resisted by miners either. I think the problem is more technical that political. Isn't it the case?

I read an article saying that actual hash/joule ratios are similar in both, marginally better for Halong. Something is odd. Halong has asicboost AND 10nm tech and is only marginally better than antminers?
One possible answer is that algorithm and ASIC design are subpar but I'm not sure how much can you gain, provided that SHA256^2 algorithms are extensively known and ASIC optimization design decisions are usually made by algorithms (wild guess on my side)

I took a quick glance at both links. There are no doubts about the first byte 0x02
But the other three bytes can be anything.  Stratum spec only specifies the mask, but AFAIU the mask is 0xFFFFFF so miners can submit any combination of bits. I find it very strange that the only blocks mined have 0x00 and 0xFF.  I would have thought that they would have several (max 2^24) precalculated data arrays to inject them into the mining algorithm. It seems they are only using 8.  
EDIT: exponent 3*8 = 24 not 12...
EDIT2 : It may be they don't want to mess with version bits

I'm glad there is competition on the mining chips, I was getting tired of hiding my head in the sand.
But my understanding is that the relative simplicity of SHA256^2 make the implementation on ASICs simple, as in: no too much room for improvement, maybe 10-20%.
So even a mediocre implementation of both 10nm &amp;&amp; AsicBoost should have been way better. I'm open for answers because I know I can be wrong.
Maybe the AsicBoost part was poorly implemented, I noticed there were no more asicboost blocks since 4/5 , this of course can be variance, but not very likely.

If the discovery algorithm doesn't work well, LN will evolve into a multitude of hubs that will keep a giant cache of routes to popular payment sinks. They will charge a fee but you will only need to open channels with one of them. I'm fine with this.

Somebody who got lots of bitcoin for free. Spare half as savings. Sell 1/4 for fiat. Set a pace of price increase like 3 pct monthly for instance, sell when market is above the desired price and buy when below. You don't need to fool the market,  only bootstrap the currency to make it better than alts and fiat  . Wait a few years. Profit

The mining endgame will be dominated by the price of energy and not by the possession of certain ASIC technology or patents. We all know that technology can be replicated, ASICs are highly scalable but energy is not.  Eventually the technology differences will be so small that windmills/solar cells/hydro in remote locations will be where the real edge will be.

This assertion implies that being Satoshi is good.
If we change "being Satoshi"  to "being Jack The Ripper" your Example C is more interesting:  A person goes to the police officer and says "I'm Jack the Ripper please arrest me", policeman asks "What? I don't believe you" , person shows a knife with blood and says "test the DNA of this blood and you'll find out". Tests show that is dog DNA.

So the timeline is :
1 - Craig invites Gavin (and others) to London, pay for everything. Make them sign an NDA
2 - Craig convinces Gavin by smalltalk and social tactics, then does the "magic trick" with a fake electrum wallet
3 - Craig asks Gavin (and others) to disclose what they saw on a particular date but before "the blog post"
4 - Craig publishes "the blog post" but it turns out to be a half-cooked proof debunked in hours by reddit patrols
5 - Reddit patrols start making conjectures about the "magic trick" and found a plausible explanation. Electrum confirms that signature was not checked.
6 - Gavin sticks to his statements for some hours
7 - Gavin surrenders with an email to Dan Kaminsky

ASICS are not new. It's just that you need capital to design one and then pay a foundry to produce them in high quantities. Also, most foundries check for IP rights so you can not steal the design and embed them into your chip.
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:32:48
well, you can consider the word "debasement" with a broader sense: inflating the money supply more than necessary to assure a reasonable target inflation.
The currencies that work are trying to do that and I have to say it is working. Central Banks are working fine for their mandate. My problem lies in that the whole premise relies on the lack of freedom to choose other currencies.

You are right that blocks can be indistinguishable. But the point is that foundries will refuse to produce chips if they have patented IP. You can tell ASICBoost is implemented by looking at the ASIC design someone submits.
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:54:04
now i remember, it was not latency it was bandwidth: the longer the blocks the more it takes to propagate to 90% of the nodes, the more orphaning rate.  There is an upper limit for blocks, for example if a block is so large that takes more than 10 minutes to be propagated to 50% of the mining nodes, the network will fall apart

I think human economic activity should not be taxed. All the state burden should be put on taxing the rights to use natural resources: land, water, radiofrequency, EPA permits, etc.  There will be some huge spikes in some values, for example you will be paying a lot for having a large house, but you will not pay a dime on taxes for the guy mowing the grass.   
Anyways, you want it or not, human economic activity will be very hard to tax fairly once crypto enters mainstream. Evading taxes will be easier than ever.

I differentiate flow from stock: flow: bitcoin going back and forth for buying stuff or transfer money /  Stock: use of bitcoin as savings by hodlers. I estimate more than 70% of bitcoin flow is by people not interested in any political debate, they will flee to other crypto if there is a massive disruption. Price is sustained by hodlers thinking there will be flow

Let's say BCC is 280 USD, Ver sells one BTC and can buy 10 BCC.
But if he tries to maintain BCC at the same price as BTC everything will fall to the ground

One option is to start a business you would like and subsidize (i.e. for example reinvesting all profit and even more)  it using your crypto wealth.  This way you will bankrupt the competition to get a greater market share, take more risky business decisions and have fun doing what you love.

I appreciate your analysis. I understand there were major improvements on energy efficiency in the last few years. 
But I think the days of "hardware design advantage" are over, we are quickly entering the era of diminishing returns (you need to invest a lot to gain a smaller % of efficiency), we are already on the edge of technology and crypto mining does not have the money to push the boundaries further (I speculate, don't know for sure)
So increasingly mining will be about "getting free or cheap energy"  and not "designing or timing the buy of better hardware" . 
Eventually all active hardware will be similar in efficiency and I even envision people turning them on only on periods where the total fees are high. That will create a stabilizing factor in block times.

I'm all for Core values and stance. But I don't think is good to have only one view in this space.  I hedl because bitcoin is HARD to change and there isn't a single entity controlling it.

Excellent writing. I would have clarified that the 21M limit can be changed but the recent bitcoin war demonstrate that the protocol is far more resistant than democratic laws and policies. The ones dictating the bitcoin parameters are holders that would prevent any depreciation of their assets
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:02:12
I agree with your opinion, monetary policy is a valid and useful tool for nation states. Bitcoin might be a great tool for individuals.
