Do not panic buy. There will be more opportunities.  
Get rid of your fear of using the coin first, start learning to use your own wallet and test with small amounts.

Don't worry if you can't see the solution. Smarter minds are working on it.

You'll all be gone when the price dips and stay there for years. And then we will be able to discuss technicalities instead of moon

Whats the point ? Whoever installs it is already aware of the difference.

He did nothing for Bitcoin, he did everything for himself. 2x won't be forgotten. Theres no way you're trying to ruin Bitcoin and act like its saviour.

Have you seen any blockchain the size of Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:45:02
You're not alone. You're right up there with a lot of well known "economists". Thing is Bitcoin doesn't care what you think. It will be doing its own thing weather you believe it or not.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:22:10

You are trying too hard.

POS is a pipe dream so no.  
But Bitcoin is already a hybrid POW+POS since the ones holding the coins dictate the direction Bitcoin goes.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:48:26
Some people do. But overall we're trying to fix the centralization we have now through other optimizations.

You're not wrong just a bit late. Glad you made it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:30:09
Congrats. Now invest in your education. Bitcoin is a complex system and the more you know the more you'll be able to see its potential and the more you'll invest.

Bitcoin only works if people take care of their own money. If that means they need to get burnt till they learn so be it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:49:03
We still have to see if Bitcoin will work at all. Do you not get that cryptocurrency is still an experiment ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:14:30
Whats the point of Amazon accepting it if the whole world doesn't own Bitcoin and it has a price markup. It would still be cheaper to use fiat. I'm not disputing the whole point of BTC just that its not ready for that we're still many many years away. You guys just want to get rich and don't give a shit about the technology, Bitcoin doesn't need you.

On the other hand, Erik is irrelevant to Bitcoin.

Smart people are working together and so are con men.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:39:30
Bitcoin Core is what powers the network you won't find safer than that. Electrum is popular as well and it has a lot of peer review.  
What you are talking about is not wallet safety is computer safety which is another issue. Your money is as safe as your computer. And your paper wallet is safe as long as its not stolen from you. But all this issues have nothing to do with software or Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-07 09:42:43
Don't invest in things you don't understand is one thing.  
Don't trust anyone with your private keys is another thing.  
But generally it means you have to truly understand Bitcoin and make your own decisions. Be responsible for your own actions.  
Fiat and the world we live in is so fucked up because people are lazy and prefer to be hand fed instead of taking resposibility for their own well being.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:12:03

The UTXO set grows with the number of transactions. If SW allows more transactions it means UTXO will grow faster. (4x if we assume full blocks)
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:00:28
Thats how its always been. Thats what got us here in the first place. For the first time in history through technology and now through Bitcoin humanity has the chance to take its destiny into its own hands.  
We seem to prefer cat pics instead. We'll see where this leads us.
@_date: 2015-12-08 11:47:05
You haven't addressed what I've said though. Is it false that the number of transactions increases UXTO ? Is it false that SW allows for more transactions ?
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:42:56
There is no way to verify it. If it were possible we wouldn't be talking about sybill attacks.
@_date: 2017-02-02 19:20:26
the difference is that in the bitcoin world people vote with their money so they won't vote for a puppet just to show you whos the boss. Trump was elected out of spite.

If its not reached then bitcoin stays the same and thats alright.  
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:40:13
everyone including Core wants a blocksize increase if its technically feasible. What we don't want is politics involved in Bitcoin and that is what BU is.

This is not politics, we don't have to choose a lesser evil.  
We can wait for the right solution. As it is Bitcoin is working fine. If people want to block Segwit so be it, bitcoin will still be here.

There is one way, the one way you're looking to spam. Luckly reddit is smarter than your preferred miner

When its free you are the product.
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:53:09
Miners can vote to activate segwit but after that they're no longer in control. Any attempt to impose their rules will result in a fork off!
@_date: 2017-02-02 14:59:17
that is enough for BU to lose all credibility. We're not playing monopoly here and whoever is foolish enough to trust BU with their money deserve what they're going to get.
@_date: 2017-02-06 13:53:52

Once you notice a transaction there is a probability (pretty big usually) that it will get confirmed. With segwit you don't notice it till its confirmed.
@_date: 2017-02-01 08:44:09
Gamblers complaining about bitcoin fees is at best laughable.  
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:38:29
So sorry for your trouble. Please use your bank next time and spare us.
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:04:06
Because theres no way to verify that a node is real or just a proxy, so now everyone has an incentive to run fake nodes to get paid.
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:02:57
If there will be a fork you will need to study both sides and make your own decision. But so far its just fear mongering so nothing to see here.
@_date: 2017-02-02 15:01:47
thats just greed at play. Nobody sane would actually follow BU but if they can get some more money faking it why not.
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:53:37

Depending on how much you know everything in Bitcoin is complicated.  
It took years to explain to a small bunch of people what Bitcoin is and still not a lot get it.  
Segwit is new so it is normal that it requires explanations.

Those electrum servers you freely connect to (for now) are still running bitcoin nodes and they are kept up out of altruism.  
As the cost of running such nodes increases the only reason to run this nodes will be extra fees or your data.

This is the first stage of the arms race but once asic development reaches moore's law we will get to the next step of decentralization.  
We're almost there and with segwit and lightning Bitcoin will be unstoppable. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:01:43
Thats like supporting the popular opinion even if its wrong.

While it might be true that thats what they want they have no right to ask for it.

If by consensus we modify the block size limit to 2mb then its not an altcoin. Nobody is saying that.
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:50:28
Its not about tx maleability. Wallets that are not aware of segwit don't see the transactions when they hit the mempool, they only see them when they get into a block.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:51:25

Fact is only 25% are signaling support.

I agree that 2MB sounds like a good compromise, however it sends the signal that if you're loud enough you can get your way.  
Lets get segwit through and 2MB will definitely be a thing in the future.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:01:19
The best way forward is segwit.  A solution proposed and tested by the best minds of the industry.  
The worst solution is one coming from clueless users.
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:25:02
They obviously have to mine their chain first of all so attacking another chain would divert hashpower unless... would a merged mining attack work ?
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:16:49
You're not adding any value or stability to the network with this.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:17:52
Says who?
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:49:45
You're right. So how should we move forward ? Pulling more random numbers or based on technicals ?
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:43:15
This can be done today if pools have a private ip to submit your transactions to (I remember theres a service doing this already).  Just submit to your preferred miners.  
Edit: preferredminer.com
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:01:00
Miners don't need to fear losing fees. The fees + the block reward are the payment received for your contribution to Bitcoin.  
As long as you do your job you will get paid, its in everyone's interest that that happens.
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:52:38
you are annoying spreading this over and over again
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:19:59
Not the same as mining since mining has costs. Opening a hub is zero cost (aside from the locked in funds which you will get back).  
If big hubs become centralized then users that don't want to use those hubs will use yours even if that means a marginally bigger fee. (cost of privacy)
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:05:28
It will also show that if you're loud enough you could see your changes go through which is a no no.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:00:46


@_date: 2017-03-09 19:01:58
It does not have to do this forever. Its enough that they revert the chain and create chaos for a day in order to create considerable damage to the minority chain.

Why would Core satisfy the desires of some random bitcoin attackers ?
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:07:39
So your argument is what? Just your own opinion?  
Edit: FYI: everyone can run a lightning node so while big nodes might be regulated we can always spawn nodes behind anonymous networks like tor for cases where privacy is important.
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:18:12

@_date: 2017-03-20 13:34:00
It will.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:38:16
This will send the wrong signal that that if you're loud enough you are able to influence Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-29 10:28:09

The voice of users doesn't matter pre-fork because theres no way you can force those users to follow on their word when the fork happens.   
Its actually guaranteed they will flake on their word and go for the most  advantageous option.  
Its pretty much like  the users that voted for are nowhere to be found.  
POW is the best we've got.

Not in Bitcoin Jesus thats for sure 
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:29:14

A POW change will only be done if absolutely required. A 2MB block is not required we have segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-17 10:50:16
Still, the non-segwit recipient won't see an incoming segwit transaction until the transaction is confirmed.
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:54:08
That wasn't the point. The point was that 2nd layer solutions are regulated and we need unregulated ones.  
The fact that you personally don't care about donating to wikileaks is irrelevant.

Lets just accept the fact that not every Bitcoin Core user understands what segwit is and some just go with the flow. This numbers mean nothing and this is why we already have a voting mechanism in place.

You guys got the part about economically relevant full nodes, right ?  
 Nodes running on a VPS doing nothing do not help.

Hashrate follows the money and the money stays with Core.
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:13:34


You know what, you need to go fork yourself off. Just because you wouldn't do something doesn't mean you have to impose it on everyone.  
What about the ones that do want to donate to wikileaks ? Bitcoin is not about your freedom its about everyone's freedom and especially about those freedoms you don't like.  
Go play with your own coin, this community and Bitcoin owes you nothing.
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:03:44
Most hashpower doesn't equal longest valid chain. The premise of Bitcoin is that in order to redo the longest chain you need to redo all the work
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:06:27
It that a counterargument ? Segwit is a safe upgrade to the network that can be done right now with little hassle.

What ? Each node does its own validation.
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:33:05
yes but not all nodes matter. Your nodes will matter just for node count which  
is the easiest number to game and nobody is using it for anything.  
The nodes that matter are well connected nodes that have economic activity.  
Example of nodes that matter: miner nodes, exchange nodes, electrum nodes,  
joinmarket nodes and all other bitcoin services nodes.

75% of the hashpower is not signaling segwit, are you trying to say they're all controlled by one miner ?

Right, but your message implies that with lower hash rate come lower fees which is false.

You conveniently missed the blockchain size in your graphic (hint: its 100GB and growing)
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:24:49
Make sure you move your coins before importing your private keys.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:38:13
It is a small amount but its better than nothing. If you don't need this money in the next 5 years go ahead and get your feet wet.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:48:27
Wheres your testnet and for how long has it been running ?
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:37:41
Segwit alone won't cut transactions costs as much, for low fees we'll have to wait for lightning network.  
Segwit just activated, stuff has been running on testnets for quite a while, give it some time and we'll see them in production. Nothing is going to happen overnight though.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:29:04
Do tell. Why use the fact that storage grows over time but no mention of blockchain size ?
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:03:11
Thats a nifty idea. Thanks for posting.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:34:11
If you control your private keys this cannot happen. If you keep your coins with a 3rd party everything is possible.

You can detect if an incoming transaction is rbf and and accordantly

There are are ways to split the coins. One of them was posted today: 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:33:02
Highly unlikely that the transaction won't go through unless you set a really low fee. Given that its safe to claim your btc and use them.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:05:50
How is that ?
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:27:45
Spending will come. Nobody is going crazy that you can't spend gold.

When you control your private keys theres no credit needed. You automatically own the private keys for both blockchains.

@_date: 2017-11-28 08:55:55
Any cryptocurrency is programmable money due to its digital nature as opposed to fiat which does not have this property. Being a store of value and programmable money is not a contradiction. (store of value being just one of Bitcoin's properties)
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:11:26
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:31:28
Your problem is that you believe everything you read on the internet.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:02:18
That doesn't work because nodes don't accept double spends. You can use a higher fee only if its rbf.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:32:52
You need to learn to be patient. We still have 100 years to go.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:33:58

Lesson is don't invest in things you don't know anything about.

The cost of a double spend is 50%+1 of hashpower. Nobody is going to waste that for a coffee.

If you control the segwit address its possible:  
Segwit addresses are generated from legacy addresses. You need to find a way to extract the private key from the segwit address and use that in a BCH wallet.

Helping the unbanked is one of Bitcoin use cases however currently due to scaling issues it is not yet suitable for small value transactions. This will be possible in the future as we solve the scaling problems but it is not a priority as we have to keep Bitcoin's decentralized nature at all costs. (Without it Bitcoin is useless).  
Light wallets are available and you don't need a big data plan to use them and theres sites  that intermediate exchanges between individuals. So what you're describing is already theoretically possible just not practical yet.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:43:38

This could work if you can rework it in a way that doesn't take away from Bitcoin's security model.

I agree its highly improbable but not totally of the charts.

My understanding is that overt asicboost is detectable on the blockchain so the other miners will have all the incentives to orphan their blocks.

You won't. Its a dangerous gamble.  
While its true that the miners will follow the money its also true that money will go to the most secure chain.

That is a legitimate concern. Segwit has been in running in production for less than a month and its in no way a proven technology (nor is Bitcoin for that matter).

Yes. Once you open a payment channel you can do multiple payments through LN without waiting for confirmations. (its like opening a checking account)

Something definitely went wrong with one of those exchanges. The past month was the slowest month in terms of transactions and all old transactions cleared.  
In order to have a 'faster' Bitcoin you need to use a bitcoin wallet that has smart fees and allow you to set your custom fee depending on network usage. Since we're talking about exchanges theres little you can do as they don't allow you to set custom fees.

You are talking gibberish pretending to be smart. Bitcoin scaling is an unsolved problem in cryptocurrency. This is a technical problem and we've got the best technicians working on it.  
What bitcoin scaling is not is a matter of public opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:46:06
Its the opposite of a free market. A free market means everyone is free to mine a regulated market means only some can mine.  
The moment you are able to pick the miners someone will try to coerce you to not use some miners and bye bye free market and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:44:09
Its very much linked to profitability. Once profitability drops some miners will drop and so will difficulty making it profitable again.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:03:37

Miners care only about their bottom line so they will follow the money. The idea is that by voting with your money miners will have no choice but to follow.  
Exchanges are regulated entities so they need to be careful how they act or risk getting sued into oblivion. I expect that in the event of a UASF most of bitcoins will be off exchanges so they will have very little say.

I get what you're saying and I'm not very fond of coinbase either, however if I were to design the cold storage for a company as big as coinbase I would design it in such a way as to be able to withdraw only a certain amount per day. In the worst case scenario you would lose an x% amount but you'll know the next minute.  
I'm not saying this is the case with coinbase but I guess we can give them the benefit of the doubt. I imagine they have some pressure from the extra worldload they have to deal with.

miners get work according to their capacity. If you have a big miner it will get more complicated work as opposed to a small miner.

flip a coin ?

What good is your own blockchain if nobody accepts it ?  
You can too print your own money its just that nobody is going to take you seriously
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:40:13
Great argument. /s  
You got your freedom now let others, not so lucky, have it.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:53:16
This shouldn't be news
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:08:17
Thats where you're misunderstanding the system. Nobody is in control and thats the beauty of it.
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:24:35
The reason the world is such a mess is because nobody thinks long term and we're always kicking the can
@_date: 2016-07-11 19:29:55
Good job Bitcoin!

Who pays is not a technological problem and even if it would be you have no idea what its going to be like.

Because once segwit is activated he can no longer use asicboost even if he can mine non segwit blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:49:15
How does any of that change anything for you ?

You're not taking into account the other fees you're paying to the bank.  
You're paying monthly fees just for the privilege of having an account with them.

The biggest problem with trades is trust. You are creating a scammers paradise
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:18:01
Could it be that people value other things before fees ?
@_date: 2016-07-10 07:28:10
all cool and dandy but where do we pay the income tax from ?
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:43:44
I am thinking long term and as far as I'm concerned Bitcoin can stay as it is for the next ten years if needed. I don't need solutions shoved down my throat by a group of people I don't care for.

You are free to believe whatever you want. I see very few rich people that have a clue, most are spoiled brats.

The miners need to chose pools that represent their wishes. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:43:41
As long as there are transactions that pay a higher fee than you do those will have priority. So it can take anywhere from one day to never
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:38:35
You are not owned anything. If you want to get into the next block you pay the price, otherwise wait till some miner will find your fee an acceptable one.

There is little reason to hold altcoins outside speculation. For sure atomic swaps will enable you to use other currencies but that is assuming the other party is accepting your altcoin which if he is a rational player won't.  
Paying through the lightning network will have same fee if you pay to another Bitcoin holder or to a crypto holder so that doesn't make much sense either.
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:35:04
If you don't know what to do the best action is no action: HODL
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:28:42
How is lightning network not trustless ?
