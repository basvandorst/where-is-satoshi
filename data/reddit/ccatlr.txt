14acres of solar panels, and mention of subsidy or something from the city.

probably be a good idea to keep it off site, encrypted and accessed remotely. Even then no amount of encryption will stop a warrant. At least in the us.
The biggest customer of this type of business would probably be silk road folks. So you could probably make a killing initially. Then spend a large chunk of your fortune on legal.

Yea, create a company and your customers can ship to customer number address, then you forward the package along to the persons actual address that you have in the customer database. Charge a monthly fee up to a certain number of packages. So if they use it less than maximum number of packages it's just straight profit.
Although this business model would probably put a target on your back as far as the govt is concerned.

maybe that's why is sounds like a movie to me.

didn't realize they had these for real world goods. so something along the lines of mailbox etc. but "anonymous"?
EDIT: A mailboxes etc, that mails packages instead of holding them that is.

and this is a pretty good read. it's along those lines of how transactions could be tracked since the transaction list is public.
EDIT: and I was under the impression that you could create sending addresses too, this article says otherwise.

bitcoin transactions have nothing to do with any IRC network.

it has defaulted to off since 0.6. I think it uses dns and peers now.

and if it was going to happen somewhere, merchant addresses are probably where you would have your anonymity compromised.
@_date: 2012-09-08 23:23:46
That is my thinking as well.
@_date: 2012-09-08 23:09:11
correct :)

very neat. thanks for the link.

I remember a case a while back where the defendant had data on an encrypted drive that was relevant to the prosecutions case, and the judge ordered the defendant to unlock it.
The thing to do would be rig a kill switch, or something that would zap the data during a raid. One could possibly keep offsite backups and just keep denying they exist. As long as they had no way to prove data was backed up offsite, you may be ok, as it would be expensive for them to prove.
This would also make a great premise for a movie.

I had a tablet get stolen a few years ago. the wallet would survive a factory reset.
wherever it's at it has about 130k in bitcoin on it. 
I think of it often. mostly when I can't afford to eat.
