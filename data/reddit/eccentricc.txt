Is there anyway to get your wallet back after restoring your PC lol. Back in 2013 I had several coins. It just sucks because I have a video that I was going through my folders and I can see the wallet(the program for it) in there :(

All it said was 'Binary File /dev/sda3 matches'

It is running right now. It said enter the passphrase for the wallet that will contain all the recovered keys. I took a guess it meant it will lock the folder with a password after it recovers the wallets? Or does it want the wallet password because I don't remember even setting one

Will pywallet find the wallet.dat? I tried a windows search through the entire computer and wallet.dat doesn't exist

Could you explain why bitfinex is "shady"? I can understand if you aren't a US resident, but most exchanges have some sort of minimum, not just bitfinex

Just look up a guide on how to get your btg fork and most other forks will work about the same. I haven't done it yet since I would just hold on to them anyways but it isn't too difficult from what I've heard. You do need your private key to your wallet through so any online wallets won't work

I remember when it was just 10gp, man inflation hit hard

I'm not going to pay $30 to transfer $5 worth of bitcoins. Until bitcoin sorts out their transaction mess I'm not going to buy/sell. I still have some bitcoins but it's going to sit until they do something. Plus I would really prefer if a private coin became the norm.      
^(come on zcash)

Back when I bought at 4k my friends all laughed at me and told me I was wasting my money and that the bubble would pop any day and crash down to 0... To this day they are still saying the same thing and they are CS grads :thinking:

But you're on Reddit which means you're probably more tech savvy than even these guys...

As long as it's properly cool and clear of dust you really shouldn't see any issues

Haha speaking the truth! Cryptocurrency's are the future and we are just starting to get into it now!

Make sure the email is not fraud but if you have done this here is a statement directly from bitfinex's website:


We will not seize your funds, but you may no longer use our services. Please wind down trading and funding and withdraw your funds as quickly as reasonably possible. Note, however, that if funds remain on the platform for an extended period of time, they will be treated as abandoned property according to the Bitfinex Terms of Service. We will work with all users to make sure they get their funds off Bitfinex in a smooth and simple manner.)

Even if they were buying their own tether why would it matter? The idea of tether is to be backed 1:1 USD-USDT, it isn't like they could manipulate the market to increase the price which in return would give them profits.. Tether no matter what should always be worth $1 even if they would buy 500million worth for example

A lot of places unfortunately do not take PayPal due to charge backs which cryptocurrencies are trying to prevent

I'm still confused on how you got "free money" from the last fork. If the coin splits won't demand drop for a specific coin so the overall price would drop? Are you saying you bought the coin after a crash made by the last fork?
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:37:31
How'd you get the coins from the split? I was thinking when it splits you would get x amount of one coin or the other. Do you get the same amount for both forks then?
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:23:58
I use coinbase currently, how's it going to work with them? Should I withdraw it into a personal wallet?
