That would be very bad, but won't they easily be able to provide a proof of holdings like most of the good exchanges do now. In fact this might be a legal requirement. If so, I would hope the market would select these funds over any that refuse to provide such proof.
Bitcoin makes transparency like thus much easier than with something like gold.

This is where a proof of stake coin such as [blackcoin]( can offer a real alternative for the future.

I think if you released btc before receiving payment you forfeit the ability to use localbtc to sort the problem out. The only reason for someone to ask you to do this is to scam you. Sorry.

+1. Electrum is awesome and works very well on Linux with great deterministic wallet feature. I still use the qt wallet to store larger amounts.

Yeah I have used it once but prefer localbtcs. Do you use any actual exchanges? My experience in UK is that lbtc is still one of the best go tos for btc and I can usually buy them in large amounts very fast there

Not sure about btc but I am cloud mining ltc ATM at a profit. Obviously there is a sense in which it is all a bit silly. But it does also make sense for both parties. The miner mines more than they pay out so make a profit and they get your money up front to invest in expanding their farm to keep pace with increasing difficulty. The investor is then clearly investing in something and can return a profit on it.
I think the key point is they secure money well before the mining returns a profit. Massively reduced risk and allows them to expand business. That is why they do it, makes sense to me.

The escrow system on localbitcoins should have stopped this from happening. Have you raised it with them? The coins should have been in escrow before you paid.
On re reading your post I realise you probably ended up making an informal arrangement with a seller. This is a bad idea. 
I think you should try localbitcoins again. I use it in the UK a lot. Choose someone selling for bank transfer with a good reputation. When you click 'buy', the coins will be held in escrow and you have a lot more security. Good sellers respond fast, the rates are competitive and you can buy btc in minutes via a simple bank transfer.
@_date: 2014-12-05 09:01:13
I can only imagine that if btc takes off in such places there will be all sorts of people on the street and small shop fronts exchanging btc for fiat. This is already the case for other currencies. As it gains hold people will start to exchange btc for goods.
Right now it isn't such a good use case scenario but it is only a matter of time. If there is money to be made people will do it.

If someone had shown me a week like this last year I would have been amazed. How quickly Bitcoin is moving forward!

Very sad in the modern world that men still behave like this. Any of the other people there should call the sexist idiots out on this. I'm also often saddened by how many comments on r/bitcoin assume people are male and make bad sexist jokes and comments. Please, it's the 21st century.
Sorry you had this experience and thank you for writing about it, hope it will make more idiot men think about their actions.
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:20:22
I don't know how it is where you live but in the UK bank transfers are now almost instant and free. So I buy off sellers via localbitcoins using bank transfer to sellers account. I guess i could make a cash deposit in their account but it seems crazy when I can just do a bank transfer from my armchair at 1am and receive bitcoins 5 mins later.
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:07:32
So glad you wrote this comment. First thing that popped in my head when I saw that headline. Come on r/bitcoin you can do better than this please.
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:29:04
This is good but it doesn't convey the idea that you do not need to trust any individual or group of people.

If you know where the top is then of course you will sell at it and buy back cheaper. But do you? Or where will the next bottom be? Without that knowledge it's just gambling and that's why a lot of people choose to hold as they prefer the long term gamble that one day it will be worth a lot more than it is now. If you can call the ups and downs there's a lot of money to be made but most people tend to fuck up the short term trading strategies.

But people use public key cryptography all the time without even realising. If that happens with btc then we're all laughing.

Thanks Vitalik, Ethereum is a cool project and wish you all the best of luck. No need for hating between communities just cos of a few idiots. Hope you get it sorted soon.

But at least in the UK we can use sites such as Grooveshark which are banned in Germany.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:20:28
A useful resource. A few comments:
* Some of the grammar needs cleaning up. E.g. "Once you've did that click the top right to open up your profile"
* I would use the term 'wallet' instead of 'client' as it is in much more common usage.
* I think that for new users Electrum is a much easier wallet to get started with. It is also available on Android and it is deterministic so if people remember their seed they don't have to worry about backups.
* If you are going to recommend backing up wallets in the cloud I think you should instruct people to make sure they are encrypted. 
Hope that helps.

As far as I am aware, all major UK banks do not allow transfers to the major bitcoin exchanges. I guess they think it might offer some threat to them ;-)
Many people used to use services such as Transferwise as a middle man but then even their bank [blocked]( them from making transfers to bitcoin exchanges. As far as I am aware there are some other similar and smaller services (e.g. currency fair) which you can still use to get money to **and** from bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:08:43
Yes it is that simple. Select "Encrypt Wallet" asap. This will encrypt your wallet.dat file. Choose a strong password. When I backup my wallet I further encrypt (with a different password) with TrueCrypt for double layer of security so I can store it elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-08-19 14:51:27
That is only part of the service. People can also advertise to sell coins via bank transfers without meeting up. Local bitcoins offer an escrow service and sellers and buyers gain trust ratings. It is actually very cool and with the difficulty of getting money to exchanges at the moment (esp. from the UK) it is one of the easiest ways for Joe Blogs to buy bitcoins. The prices are also quite competitive nowadays. Have a look at the site.
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:28:57
Understand why you might be suspicious, but I have been following this reddit for long time now and been meaning to contribute. Something relevant to me in the UK came up and that was the impetus to make an account and make first comment. I'll be back ;-)
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:03:33
You can also speed things up a bit by downloading the blockchain from a torrent [here]( However it is not updated too regularly.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:38:57
Or much easier - go to localbitcoins, choose a seller with a good reputation who accepts UK bank transfers and then make the payment to them. I think this is still the quickest and easiest way to buy large quantities of bitcoins in the UK.
@_date: 2013-08-13 23:15:33
The Android app?
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:47:19
Sounds very similar to [this story]( The conclusion there was that the restaurant had not configured bitpay properly.
@_date: 2013-08-16 12:09:47
I'm sure that is much higher than most any other products people can buy. Considering how marginal bitcoin still is (most people haven't even heard of it) nearly 2% is actually quite heartening I think :-)
@_date: 2013-08-26 08:34:19
For second encryption of your wallet, zip us rubbish. 7zip better but I would suggest using truecrypt. It is a really easy way to make strong encrypted folders on your computer. Put an encrypted wallet in one of these and then you can store it many places as mentioned.
@_date: 2013-06-24 13:16:32
Just gave this a go and got my coins very quickly. Hope they keep open for a little while. Good luck.
People in UK always complain that it is so hard to buy bitcoin. For ages now localbitcoins has had a lot of people offering sale by UK bank transfer at very competitive prices. Now with this it is even easier. No excuses!
