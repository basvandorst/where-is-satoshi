I call dibs on 50 Gwei

Even without the USD vs USDT issue, exchanges simply have different prices.
Even Gemini vs GDAX there is a difference.

Move BTC to Monero. Send Monero to new address. Convert Monero back to BTC if you like.

Is it possible to collect the fees while still causing 1 satoshi to never exist?
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:41:20
That's just every crypto sub already.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:21:03
That mt gox crash doesn't look so bad anymore
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:18:10
Even better idea. I had assumed he understood that you could lose your principal investment.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:50:40
Your brain can also lose that money though.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:58:51
That's the same exact argument made in 2013, I assume.

That message has shown up for a year now whenever anyone signs up. It's not new.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:15:31
Probably around Nov 29

Satoshi confirmed
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:50:07
LTC jumped 30% today.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:00:18
Who's to say he didn't have other keys that the public doesn't know about?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:51:27
I think we might have reddit hugged it to death. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:52:22
Just offer to do it for him at a huge fee (coinbase style)
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:19:50
He’s not in Florence ADX, but Florence High.

Gemini is the only other exchange I know of that will do ACH transfers from US Bank Accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:32:12
I'm confident that no random person on the street would know what Bitcoin was in 2010.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:26:26
Links to those articles?
Plus, probably not a good idea to go around bragging how much money you have, in fiat or in crypto.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:28:52
Chances are you would have sold at $2/BTC or $5/BTC, unless you forgot about it. So don't dwell on it.
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:12:08
It's amazing how the peaks are very well correlated with BTC price.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:34:57
I mean, given the fact that you had to UPLOAD your ID and provide your SSN to Coinbase, they can already trace it to you anyway.

It's not like millionaires in real life get held hostage on a daily basis, and their information is on public record.
Why is a bitcoin millionaire any different?

 The saddest real-life realization of this thread
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:05:34
Coinbase has nowhere near the market share of MtGox in 2014 though
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:50:53
His FB was hacked as he mentioned.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:33:20
Also those who bought some for fun in 2010, and forgot about them until recently.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:41:45
That already happened in 2013-14 when the price tumbled from 1200 to 200, and people declared Bitcoin as dead.

They are complementary goods.

$1,000,000,000,000 is one trillion, not one quadrillion.

easy, just buy every single combination

With how much the path has changed in 36 hours, still better be safe than sorry. Hurricanes can change paths again quickly.

Congrats for completely ignoring the question. I didn't say the US is completely non violent and that there are no countries in state of war in 2017. I'm saying that the world now is far more peaceful than it has ever been in the 2000 years before 1945.
@_date: 2017-09-12 05:11:16
If it were the greatest threat to world peace, why has the world never been more peaceful since 1945 than compared to the times before it?
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:49:55
Or you could give him 4.5000000 BTC ;)
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:51:14
too bad you don't own 21M

Even if he did win, chances are he would have spent it all in 2013.
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:47:13
But if you used the dumped ETC to buy more ETH, you would have done better. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:33:34
Why does the bitcoin address looked photoshopped
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:08:36
Aren't they solvent again thanks to the rise in Bitcoin price now?
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:18:41
That's what happened to ETC originally but ETC still exists today. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:11:07
But it didn't die, even after "crashing spectacularly".
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:41:41
Didn't their exchange completely shut down? How can anyone still claim they aren't a scam?
