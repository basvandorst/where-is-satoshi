And y’all bought in after they did, raising the price enough so that they could sell to newcomers and profit.

How? People who got in early make money off of people who get in later. Where does the money come from for this lambo? Is new money printed from this? No it’s the money from the people who got in later at the buy end of their sell. Zero sum game.
Honestly sad to see so many young people who can’t afford it lose so much money to pay for things like this.

First, thanks for the well thought out response.
I don’t mean that bitcoin was created to be a pyramid scheme, just that it has functionally distributed wealth like one.
I want people to realize that bitcoin “as an investment” is a zero sum game. Meaning that it has no revenue, no employees, no property, or anything that is created as a result of investing in it. Meaning that each time you see one of these lambo’s bought from bitcoin it’s been bought by the thousands of dollars that thousands of people have lost. 
And I agree with you that bitcoin as a system has value, but a unit of bitcoin compared with a unit of gold does not. I say this because people buy gold just because they like owning it itself and want to have it and not because they plan on selling it later.

Number of transactions involved in illegal activities for USD vs BTC? USD is higher, obviously, it’s has a much higher transaction count than BTC.
Percentage of transactions involved in illegal activities for USD vs BTC? Likely BTC. BTC is great for illegal purchases online, USD isn’t.

Yeah - but seems as though any wallet that didn’t implement this AND have the user update to it by the time quantum computing hits would be vulnerable to having the private key calculated from the public key as soon as quantum computers are available to calculate 256 bit numbers.

That’s the right link, but it doesn’t describe ipv6 wrapping into ipv4, doing dual stack ipv4/ipv6 is giving hosts host both an ipv4 and ipv6 address to use in parallel.
For that to be what we’re doing here we’d have both a public key with the old sha256 and a public key for a quantum-proof encryption scheme, unless you’re saying a different way.

Ok, thank you for your points.
The time I was talking about was with a washing machine, which certainly didn’t have an associated Venmo account. And it was much easier to send a picture of a code which could just be scanned than either of us needing to manually copy a number code, as well as the QR code having a massive address space.
And also although the NFC stickers may be bought it’s much easier to generate a QR code and print it out, anyone can do that themselves, print as many as they want, and change it whenever needed.
But I see where you’re coming from as do I’m sure you to me and we probably won’t change each other’s minds, but thank you for pointing these things out and I agree that it could be at least faster in many
situations. Personally I’ve also had times where NFC has failed but I’m sure that could change and be more robust too.
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:47:31
After paying you show your phone to whoever you’re paying to show it went through. Maybe it shows a code etc only they know that is shown when they are paid. 
For laundry I think they put a plastic sheet over it so it would be obvious if someone placed a sticker. Or the QR code links to a page to pay (yes that could be a fake phishing page etc)
Edit: Also this is to an account that you were verified by an ID at some point to make, so if it was fraud they could easily track you down.
@_date: 2019-04-29 04:16:18
I agree the video was clunky, but it can be as simple as opening your camera, camera sensing QR, using fingerprint or whatever to authorize a transaction. Fast as anything else, plus requires nearly no hardware to use. Small merchants you buy food from in China have no Square reader iPad, cash register, or whatever, they literally just have a piece of laminated paper with their QR that you scan and show them your phone to show it went through. Fast, no extra hardware required.

But this is how it’s getting hacked. People get malware on their computer which automatically searches the file system for private crypto keys, and bang, just like that, their savings are vaporized. 
People on here half the time complain how the bank had anti fraud measures, then the next day come back and say they’ve been hacked and their crypto is gone.
@_date: 2019-04-28 10:46:00
QR codes, regardless of crypto, actually are a great payment system though, China has many examples with WeChat.
Washing machines at laundromats that have a QR code on the machine to pay for them, much easier than having a credit card reader. Also at restaurants, QR code on your table which will allow you to pay the bill without even talking to the waiter. Very sleek examples in China.
Edit: to be clear though people, WeChat/China is not something to idealize in full. WeChat, like most mainstream Chinese owned applications is still effectively a spy tool. It just happens to allow the use QR codes in novel ways, but this in no way implies that QR codes themselves have a lack of privacy.
@_date: 2019-04-01 08:26:25
It would be. And with a deflationary system instead of inflationary system, old money becomes more valuable instead of less valuable. Thus giving less incentive to invest money in productive things and giving more guarantee that the future’s wealth gaps will be wider than ever.
@_date: 2019-04-29 07:06:34
To be clear, I’m open to being proven wrong, I’m only interested in the right answer, not being right myself.
-	But there aren’t really any retries, in fact even partially malformed QR codes can be read accurately if enough is left to be a unique identifier.
-	But again, all the merchant needs is a paper with a printed out code. And this code can also resolve to a web interface with multiple options etc. Far less tech required than with NFC and more adaptable to new circumstances. In fact, one time I needed a friend to pay for something for me, so I just sent him a picture of the QR code and he was able to scan it and pay for me remotely.
Your whole argument is based off of how NFC could be faster. Ok, maybe, but what about everything else stayed here? The simplicity of a printed QR on a table? How easy it is to carry the ability to be paid and place it in multiple places? How easy it is to send a QR code to someone remotely for someone to pay for it?
Maybe just me, but seems like more pro’s than con’s for QR vs NFC, but I’m totally open to being shown otherwise. Do you see there being other benefits to NFC that would counter this?
@_date: 2019-04-01 12:21:34
What? No incentive to invest in productive things?
Building an apartment complex to increase the supply of housing thus reducing it’s cost? Invest in a biotech company which can use that money to cure diseases? Invest in a company providing internet infrastructure to developing countries? These companies will make money, provide a service, and you will get money back from it when they are successful. This is how the stock market works. I have unused money which use to a buy a company’s shares. They then use that money to grow their company, and pay back in a dividend or if the company becomes more valuable, I can sell the share for more later.
If the company doesn’t provide any value, no one will pay them, and thus that company will fail.
@_date: 2019-04-29 09:21:45
To be clear, I agree WeChat itself is basically a Chinese spy tool, just like most China owned mainstream applications, but it does use QR codes, and I don’t think QR codes themselves necessarily have to do with nonexistent privacy.
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:54:58
Exactly, you would do that. If bitcoin happens to be deflating at 20% a year, and there’s a company trying to do medical research that in the beginning only returns 10% a year, they will go out of business because no one will be willing to invest and that research will not get done. Is this something you want in an economy?
If people don’t have enough money to hold onto it for any given period of time, they wouldn’t benefit from deflation either, correct? The organizations that take that money would, but if the poor earn their money one day and spend it the next, how would they benefit from the deflation?
To be clear, I’m open to being shown if any of these points are incorrect.
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:07:08
Though it wasn’t meant to be one, hasn’t it basically distributed wealth like one? All the lambo’s out there were all purchased by the thousands of dollars thousands of people have lost. It’s still a zero sum game.
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:15:21
Thanks for the well thought out response, this is a good point.
I guess the downside here is that it seems this could increase wealth inequality by exponentially increasing early people's wealth at the effective expense of newcomers. Because currently with 3% inflation, $100,000 \* (0.97\^30) = \~$40,000 30 years later, so old money is continuously devalued, but if increasing at 5% a year that $100,000 \* (1.05\^30) = \~430,000 after 30 years. The old money is grown by sitting, but this increasing value of old money kind of exponentiates the difficulty of younger people and future generations to acquire some, since the increasing value of the currency is effectively due to the increasing demand for the currency due to population growth etc.
@_date: 2019-01-05 14:32:46
I see what you’re saying but if you have $100,000 which is losing value at 3% per year, and your friend has a company which could use your money and return it at a 12% rate per year by being productive with it, while giving you back 7% (average return of SP500 and keeping 5% for himself, wouldn’t you have more incentive to give that money to the company and have the money be productive if it’s losing value at 3% per year than say gaining 7% already due to deflation?
To be clear, the main benefit here is that the money is productive, rather than just sitting. Meaning maybe investing in a company doing medical research uses it which helps advance medical technology in some way in which both they, and you, the investor are rewarded, as well as the world because now this technology exists and people can use it. In comparison to being incentivized to not invest your money.
@_date: 2019-01-07 02:35:59
Yeah that’s true, generally people invest their money either way, causing growth. I guess I’d wonder if people would be less likely to do it if the money itself gained value, which wouldn’t be a good thing overall, but ideally for their own (and other people’s) sake they would. Really the difference in value could be similar due to what you had stated before. Though I guess it would end up being a larger difference due to compound interest. But yeah the problem certainly exists either way.
@_date: 2019-01-05 10:55:38
This is something not enough people realize.
When your currency is inflationary people have to invest in companies to grow their wealth, and the strong movement of money is fundamentally what a strong economy is. The investments in a company help them make money so the workers can make money and have money to spend at other companies so those companies make money etc, meanwhile technological etc progress continues to happen as the economy churns.
Just holding onto your currency and not investing slows the economy and therefor job growth, technology advancement, etc, which is what people would do if their currency was deflationary.
@_date: 2018-07-16 03:59:29
True, but overall Bitcoin and all crypto is still a zero sum game. The amount of money that has been made here is equal to the money lost, since there are two sides to every transaction.

Capitalism isn’t a perfect system, but you do have to realize that through it the US brought the world cars, airplanes, computers, cell phones, the internet, a huge amount of medical advances, and nearly every new technology fundamental to the modern age.
Yes, you’re right. There’s a huge wealth gap that’s only getting larger. But you know what else has changed? Life expectancies have gone from 35 to 75, only a couple hundred people out of 350+ million starve in the US on an annual basis, and you can work a minimum wage job and have cars and other things even the richest people 500 years ago couldn’t dream of.
So yeah, it’s not perfect, but it’s done a hell of a lot to change the world in very quantitatively good ways.

@_date: 2018-04-19 20:35:49
Exactly. And inflating currencies are better than deflating currencies from a economic design standpoint. Economy is movement of money. And if people gain value in their money by not spending it, that’s a problem, because it slows the economy. 
However if money slowly devalues (~3% per year for USD) it encourages people to find companies and other people which can use their money to create new technology etc and invest their money to make it grow, rather than just not spending it.
Investing in stocks etc is good for the company which is being invested in as well as the individual.
Good economy = money moving and changing hands.
Bad economy = money stagnant and not being invested.

Blockchain aka bitcoin? Blockchain is an algorithm, Bitcoin is an implementation of this algorithm for use as a currency. Other coins do this, and I’m not arguing that bitcoin is or isn’t great, but if it’s better than other coins it’s not for this reason because most other crypto currencies also use blockchain.
I’m sensing a fundamental misunderstanding of how this all works on this sub.

If you bothered to actually look up those things you’d see the US did. There may have been small prototypes of early stages of some of these things (we all stand on the shoulders of giants as they say) but generally they were engineered by US.
Oh, and not to mention the iPhone, Microsoft Windows, UNIX, the integrated circuit, transistors. These are all some of the most fundamental technologies to our modern world, and yes it’s quite true they were invented in a capitalist US, that’s inarguable.
And you can bet in this future of machine learning that it’s US technology companies (Google, IBM, Nvidia, Facebook) are leading the way.
