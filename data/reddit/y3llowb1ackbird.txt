This was dealt with in Butterfield's original post. CCN has a sponsored story section, which is not located within the news feed. You cannot buy news stories, just advertorials (same as on most mainstream news sites).

I don't wish him ill. I think the article he did was a great concept...I think he was a little over-eager with it by not following up with the sites to confirm that he was purchasing an article in the newsfeed rather than an advertorial. This is what happened in the case of CCN. Once our director made him aware of the error, he amended his article. I cannot say whether CCN will do a story on this, but I am sure the other writers (like me) are watching this develop with interest.

Did you check the company site? ;)

This music video is hilarious! :)
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:53:59
I agree wholeheartedly!
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:35:56
oldie but a goodie
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:04:23
Yeah, that is pretty troubling.

When that "someone" includes names like Patrick Murck and Kristov Atlas, yes it does.
@_date: 2014-07-14 04:04:12
Haha, thank you for this. I am flattered that he thinks I have an entourage at my beck and call though.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:10:41
Yeah, meanwhile my checking account is missing the $2,000 I need to pay the rent and buy groceries. haha

The advertising page mentions sponsored stories.
I see how it could be confusing since both ad inquiries and news tips are sent to him. I will suggest he make a separate email for ad inquiries.
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:40:17
And yet mainstream news outlets continue to cite him. I'm thinking about writing and article for CCN calling the MSM out for this.
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:26:50
But you cannot just make unsubstantiated claims like that without any proof. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:29:56
CCN does not do that; it would be stupid because it would completely wreck our credibility. The ads CCN offers are located on this page.
 
If you don't believe me, you can find out yourself by emailing David Parker and requesting a story written, making it clear that you do not want a sponsored story but that you want to pay to have an article placed in our news feed. Sure, I could just be telling you to do this and then running and telling him to be on the lookout for someone doing this, so wait a week, a month, however long you think is necessary, and try it.

Yeah, I mean I'm just a writer so I do not set the policy but everything is above-the-board and clearly marked in several places.
@_date: 2014-08-31 20:47:47
Yeah, he really is top-notch. I have learned a lot from him.
@_date: 2014-06-22 02:42:14
Me too, I was impressed that he was willing to say it while in the same room as Bitcoin Foundation members...
@_date: 2014-07-14 03:06:24
To be honest I am not sure...although my belief is that the RSS would only use the news roll since everything else goes in that. In either case, Sponsored articles should be marked as sponsored inside the text of the rss as well.
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:08:22
Well I don't have a lot of stores around me that accept Bitcoin at POS but out of principle it's nice to be able to have mobile wallets back in case I'm ever in a city that does.
@_date: 2014-08-03 03:16:58
Yeah if you go to our front page there is a section marked sponsored stories. They also say sponsored on the article page, are placed in the sponsored story section, and are written with a non-journalistic tone.
It is my understanding that since they are not placed in the news section they will not show up in RSS feeds.
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:31:21
Yeah, what said, except in this case they are forking the text of the BitLicense proposal.
@_date: 2014-07-14 03:24:43
Um....got any evidence for that wild claim?
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:02:50
This guy is clearly being disingenuous. Cryptocoinsnews does sell sponsored stories, but they are placed in their own section, which is marked "Sponsored Stories." They are not hidden amid the news articles or even placed in the news section.
CCN is very up front about this...anyone who has ever visited the website knows that there are sponsored stories and that those stories are clearly distinguished from news stories.
Either the author did not even bother to view the sponsored article section at CCN or he deliberately chose to mislead his readers.

Here's one from USA Today. I see them pop up from time to time.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:08:59
Lol, that is ridiculous! The way i overpaid was that their website uses a plain-text form for adding deposits....like it literally looks like a login form from 1992. I submitted my deposit and got no confirmation...no message, no email, nothing...and 10 days or so pass from the day I scheduled the deposit and nothing had happened so I cancelled it and placed a new one. Then both went through!

Touche :)
