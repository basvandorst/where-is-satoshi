It says "please send Bitcoin "
It would be nice if the message said "Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash"

Bitcoin Cash is the identical protocol.  Except it followa the original intended plan for scaling.
In the end, the miners and users will decide what is what. The beauty of capitalism.
I'm also an investor (and an experienced computer scientist) and I can plainly see the adoption of BCH is staggering and the dropping of BTC (ex: Steam) is terrifying.
It's easier for BCH to double in value than it is for BTC.
From a pure capital perspective.... you know what's in your heart.

Tell me... in what sense do you "own" the coin  if it's not on either blockchain?
Doesn't one of you have to close out your position before it can truly become yours?
What if the LN payment processor goes bankrupt, or a state actor requires LN hub to automatically assign final ownership to the state, but merely issues you a **title** to your coin, before either have you have closed out your position?
How is this *trustless*, don't I need now to trust miners, and now also LN actors in this system? 
Who would close out the payment channel to the blockchain, and who bears that cost for all those micro transactions I made per month?

Awesome. Balance of worlds.
It is feasible to own a house and make 500-1000 in net profit and still live for free.
Just sharing so others can see it is not a myth

They will require a deposit to keep channel open. Or they will need to borrow the money as a loan from the hub.

ShapeShift does this.
Talk about lame

Real money is owning multiplex apartment buildings.
My tenants pay me with inflation adjusted fiat. And soon they will pay me in Bitcoin.

"Deals are never found, they are created"
Of course they weren't around, because guys like me are aggressively buying profitable triplexes and fourplexes.
Expect to spend about a few months patiently waiting, talking to people.
Now you own a liability (taxes, insurance, utility bills) instead of making money and living for free.

This. OP is making another emotional decision.

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin protocol.
Bitcoin is a network protocol and if anything the rights holder would have to file anything (aka Satoshi Nakamoto)
Why don't you cry to mommy and daddy government to help you out in all areas of your life.
Shame this is what men are like these days. I remember a time when a Man would simpky outcompete and handle things on his own

Aren't the fees right now over $10?  
How much will it cost you, and will they be able to use their money anywhere?

Be careful what you wish for.
I may just send you a Christmas card with 1 BTC in it via a multisig address where one of the keys is tattooed to my cock
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:42:58
What you are saying is that Bitcoin will get less usage in thr future not more?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:37:30
It's like I'm "always swimming in a pool".
I have pools available to me, and when I want to swim... I go in!
See... I'm always in the swimming pool

Way to spoil him.
What's wrong with a *grown man paying his own way in life*?
Mark my words... may have been a huge financial mistake for you both.

Don't help anyone learn email.
Unless they know about how to manage email accounts, email addresses, and attachments already.
How do you think people will learn, if their loved ones don't help?
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:15:54
No, then he would be killed.
We're talking about healthy capitalism honey
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:35:37
You get someone something thoughtful.
Like money, Bitcoin, investment, gift card. Nice article of clothing, etc. Because you love them.
Anything except cheap consumer shit.
Really, don't buy cheap plastic shit for people.

Bitcoin Cash Ethereum of course

You are letting your emotions control you like it did last time. 
This will not end well.
What I did was split my crypto holdings into 5 chunks of 20% each.
Here's how I protect myself with the "5 chunks".
Allocate no more than 3 of the 5 chunks to a currency that I am bullish on. Allocate no less than 1 chunk if I am bearish.
There are really only 3 currencies that matter:
1. BTC (obvious)
2. BCH (you may hate it, but has best chance of any crypto to overthrow BTC)
3. ETH (stable, crazy usage growth).
So i am currently at 20% BTC, 60% BCH and 20% ETH.
I'm bullish as fuck on BCH at current prices and it will fill a niche that BTC and ETH cannot touch.
All the best

Bitpay is now defaulting to BCH as of yesterday.  Watch adoption grow
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:30:39
You realize that you can send BTC and BCH and the receiving side has access to both, right?
At least now they have a choice of paying a $15 fee or a sub 1c fee to donate.

Should have bought a 4plex.
