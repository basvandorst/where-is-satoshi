What are you talking about? I am not the the one who came up with the whole HODL thing. That is what this entire sub is about. HODL this and that and HODL memes left and right, but the whole idea behind that is buy your fucking coins, hold them and sell them when it hits the big time. So the idea of screaming HODL then checking your balance every two seconds and freaking out at every tiny drop is totally hypocrictical. I am just trying to point out how fucking ridiculous so many of the users are here.

Why is everyone crying about their portfolio? I mean it's a tiny dip. My total is still higher than it was ten ENTIRE DAYS ago. 
These dips and parabolic increasea used to freak me out. Now I'm like so what. Just look at the average over the month, every month's avergae is an ATH. 
Are you not holding decent coins or something? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:51:25
Why the fuck do yall even look? I look at my portfolio maybe twice a week now. Its called HODL, not hodl and check my balance every two fucking seconds. Whats the point? HODL means buy some fucking coins and don't cash out till you hit the moon. Well the moon is like 12 months away probably if not a few years. So chill the fuck out and stop looking.

Well thats sweet. But that isnt the way the world works. If you want to buy black market goods and murder for higher then that is fine. 
But if you want to buy real things made in this world you have to pay taxes. Food is regulated. Cars are regulated. Houses are all built to code... relegated by the government. So unless you want to eat food that might kill you, cars that might explode and houses that might collapse on you. Then you need the government to regulate these things. And you have to give them a little tax. 
If you want to quit your job, you can live off 40k of bitcoins gains a year and pay ZERO percent. That sounds pretty sweet. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:22:43
Bingo. This is the answer.
And to avoid tax. You have pay upwards of 30% tax most places. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:20:04
Because only the morons want to "crush the banks and have no regulations". 
Some regulations are okay to keep these exhanges in line.

BTC already has fallen out of favor a little. It used to hold 90% market dominance for like 5 years, now it floats between 50 and 60%. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:53:21
Just a word of caution, if you are using a new wallet, a new exchange, a new coin. Whatever. Do a small amount first, 50$ to make sure everything happens okay. Its worth paying fees twice for the first time to make sure this type of mistake doesn't happen. 
I have been doing everything first in 50$ steps before I buy and send and exchange large amounts. Then I got excited when I bought a ton of LTC and just tried to transfer it all at once to my wallet. LTC has two types of addresses. And the exchange I was on didn't support the new address type. I thought I lost a ton of money. Luckily it never went through and it was transfer back to my account.

Please consider donating to Animal Rescue Kansai.
They are a registeted NPO with the Japanese government and the only NPO I donate to currently. Japan has horrible animal treatment. They kill over 500,000 stray dogs a year. Nearly 90% comparwd to the UK and US which kill less than 15% of strays. Places like ARK are fighting a major uphill battle. I'm originally from Alabama. And Alabama has more adoption shelters than ALL of Japan. 
I can message them on your behalf but I don't they will take me seriously, but who knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:33:11
I don't know why are you worried at all. People get red flagged all the time and are not made aware. They are just making sure you are not laundering money. Its not like they have said you have to pay tax on your holdings? 
And my understanding is any bank transfer, mutual funds included will get red flagged at 20k. It just means the IRS will take a peek to make sure everything is above board. Crypto is 15k, not 20. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:58:23

I guess you have never bought more than 50$ worth of weed before. You would be shitting bricks if you bought 500 or 1000$ worth of weed. How would barting irl be any differnt.

This is 3 years old, but I think still holds true. But I have read conflicting info on this. So take it with a grain of salt. 
" What if I exchange my bitcoins for altcoins? Is this a like-kind exchange?
This is a fair question and implicates what is known as a "like-kind exchange." Under Section 1031 of the tax code, exchanges of like-kind property do not trigger recognition of capital gains, and therefore are tax-free. Whether or not bitcoins/altoins are like-kind is uncertain to say the least. As intangible property, bitcoins/altcoins would qualify as like-kind only if they have the same rights, characteristics, and obligations. This is a very difficult test to apply to virtual currency.
Although nothing is for certain when it comes to bitcoins, I'm fairly confident that the IRS would not agree with like-kind treatment and you run the risk of having the unrecognized gains added to your tax return (with penalties and interest added). Thus, I would not suggest that you try to qualify such a transaction as a like kind exchange until further guidance on this issue is given by the IRS or you obtain a tax opinion letter from an attorney concluding that your treatment of bitcoins/altcoins as like-kind appropriate.
Lastly, keep in mind that like-kind exchanges must still be reported on your tax return (using Form 8824).
edit: IRS Notice 2014-21 concluded that bitcoins are not a foreign currency, therefore it is possible that bitcoin can qualify for like-kind treatment if the "rights and characteristics" test is met."

Why is it dying? Most of rural Japan is dying. IIRC only 3 major cities have any real growth. Toyko, Osaka, and Sapporo. 
Even places like Kyoto and Fukuoka are experensincing shrinkage do to the population decrease. People are still flocking to Tokyo and Osaka for some reason. They are fun places to visit, I think it would be shit to live there for the rest of you life. Sapporro? Beats me. Its a pretty fucking awesome city. But its cold. No idea why its growing. Maybe people from rural Hokkaido are moving there. Maybe it relatively cheap. Not sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:25:48


How do you figure. Any capital gains under FIVE years in Japan are taxed at 30%. 
Anybody who makes under 9 million is taxed at 23% or less. 
My wife makes less than 2 million a year, so I can cash out in her name and pay 5% tax!!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:58:55
They can't regulate it, but they can shut down exchanges. No exchange means no fiat.

Japan has capital gains tax of 40% why. How does that not dissuade them from in vesting in short term stuff, (they day trade a lot). And capital investments dont become long term until FIVE years in Japan, USA is only 1 year.

I am staying the fuck away from Kraken. I have seen to many people get 10k, 60k, now 200k tired up by non-answer nonsense. You are depositing more than a couple $K you need to get platiunum level butt hole licking support. I mean... come on, embarrassingly, I have over 1k in Star Citizen and I get automatic concierge support where I can ask any fucking question I want and answered either instantly by support or within hours.

@_date: 2017-12-08 12:03:34
They don't. But whenever there is a bank transfer for 20,000 or more an automatic flag is put on any transfer. So if you have a buy a car for outright or you cash out for a lot and get 500,000 put into your account, then there is a good chance the irs is going to look at it. If they see that that kind of activity is rare for you, then they look into more and that is what could.lead to an audit then they ask you where the money came from and you HAVE to tell them

There are ways to lower your taxes. Long term vs short term for example. Spreading out your gains over years. Your losses will also count against your gains.  income bracket as well matters.

No, its to take it out of their hands. Not fuck them over. There are still plenty advantages to crpyto. If you take a gold bar across country boarders and its worth more than 10k USD you have to pay tax on it, just for crossing a border. Same goes for 10k in your pocket. Crypto shatters those borders. But you enjoy the FDA watching over your food supply right? You like the fact that their are regulations on your house so it doesn't collapse on you right? Not all the government is bad. If you just made 1,000,000 dollars basically for free in a matter of months, is it really going to kill you to pay them 200,000?

Is it right or legal, no. Its when you cashout like 20k and buy a car.

there are I suppose like a copy and paste your address. I have heard there is malware that when you log into your wallet and copy and paste to send or recieve, the malware will replace the address.

I am sorry to hear this OP. This is why regulation is not a bad thing. Here in Japan the exchanges are regulated and verified by the government. Japan has 11 authorized to operate in Japan. They are all required to do ID and bank verification checks. If I send my money by bank its takes 3 hours max. If I send it by combini, it is 100% instant. 
I have simply read too many stories like this where money is taking weeks or longer to get to the exchanges. Y'all want unregulated exchanges and governments to fuck off, this is what happens. Mt. Gox happened and crypto in Japan became better for it.

Yes it does. Look at all the people cashing out. We are talking serious fucking money. For example all the US government has to do it not allow exchanges. Or they can ban certain coins from being allowed to be traded on a licensed exchange. If the government doesn't want to waste all the time and money tracking all these people skipping out on their taxes they may very well decide to simply stop allowing exchanges.

I guess my point was close exchanges or not close exchanges. I didn't want to postulate what exactly the goverment(s) might to do impact crypto in a bad way. that's a thread for another day.

Where do you think money comes from? 
Do you think you just sell bitcoin and they mail cash to your cabin in the woods? 
You sell crpyto and they have to send the money somewhere. That somewhere is a bank. They have no idea how you have. They only know how much fiat you just got. You need to explain where that fiat came from. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:14:06
They can can TRY to audit the exchanges where you make your transactions. Some are already being focred to turn over records of certain users. And if you bought at 20k and sold at 20k you don't have any captial gains and have nothing to report or taxes to pay 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:55:17

Yeah you can outright buy your property and house, but no one needs to know that. Most people have awesome houses and 500000 year mortgages. I mean, if we are talking millions and millions, it would be hard to hide. If I made 100-250k off my crypto, no one will ever know. They will just think I am in dept or frugal. They may know about my house, but not my 3 weeks 4 star hotel trip to Europe. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:19:17
just don't forget about capital gains on the at 27,000. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:51:08
No, and that's I am worried. 
It would be easier to disallow exchanges than chase down all crypto fans.

They do. You can use it to offset your gains. And your losses roll over.

I want to give my two nieces some BTC, but they are in HS and JR High. Not sure if they will appreciate it. Or if they will just lose the paper wallets in a few months. 
Just in case I decide to do this instead of the cash or a gift card, can someone ELI5 quickly how to make a paper wallet like this. Can I just go to my exchange or hardware wallet and put .001 BTC to a new private key and print it out? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:20:41
It's already down 45%, the largest drop of the year, and more importantly the USA just woke up and are going to flip out and start selling more.

getting redflagged != audit. 
It just means it has been marked and they will look at it. If they see something that looks fishy, THAT might lead to an audit. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:25:58
That's a tough one. I think you can gift a certain amount tax free, but I think that's only for family. It might be worth it to pay a one time visit with a CPA or tax attorney. I mean.... If it's like 5k worth i wouldn't worry it personally. If the IRS comes after you, tell you tried or thought it was this or that. I really think they are going after people who are maliciously evading tax. That's just my personal opionion and may very well get your in trouble. So if you are owrried pay someone who knows this shit rather than listen to idiots on internet like me. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:12:04
Did you pay short term captial gains? Please don't forget that.
Also PSA. If you hold for one year, it becomes long term captial gains (in the USA) and is taxed at a much much lower rate.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:41:38
That's the most important takeaway from this recent dip.
And scary. BTC is heavily flawed and can not handle this Volume. I won't buy any more because of the tx time and fees. But we have seen BTC dictates pretty much the enitre market. A few coins like ripple survived the blood bath but eventually came down as well
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:47:42
Really, if it hit 1 million a coin what would it do to the USD? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:09:48
Nah. We survived. Market is going to be even stronger now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:14:48
Long term can be 0% to 30% iirc.
I have no US income but I'm a citizen. So I can cash out 40K and pay O.00000 tax on my captial gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:04:45
Would they really know where the cryptocoins came from. 
I mean, I have a hardware wallet sitting here. My wife can access it. I can access it. There is no really tracing it right? I don't keep my coins online or in an exchange. My wife and I swap cash all the time. Spouses can't have joint account in Japan. I give her cash, she gives me cash all the time. Why would a few BTC be any different? Even less of a trail. 
Bro. seriously sorry for snapping at you. I feel shitty about it.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:48:04
1. no. wrong. She can get verified no problem with her own account. You can gift crypto to family members. This is legal and not tax fraud. 
2. I don't think you know what you are talking about. That makes zero sense. (edit: I mean... yes you are right about the health insurance part, but its hardly much money at all, a couple extra man a month. Not much at all) 
3. what does  have anything to do with anything. (Edit: I re-read this like 6 times I still don't know what your point is. and even if I was mining they don't know that) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:14:00
What are you going to change them to?
You need fiat for the foreseeable future. Maybe one day it will be a widly accepted currency.  But I'm talking to you. I'm talking to people CASHING out now. The laws will probably change in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:14:15
I have had to type this so many times here. The USA and USD are no where near the center of the BTC world anymore. 
Japanese YEN is driving bitcoin right now. Reddit and memes get to like 2% of BTC holders. Its corporate japan and major day traders in Japan right now driving market. Its in the news articles. But if you go here and and click on analyis you can see plain as day that YEN makes up over 50% many days its as high as 65% of total input into BTC. USD is not even 1/4 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:34:13
Don't see 3D TV on that list. Is it so high its off the charts? 
Joking aside, I get what you are trying to show... but there are tech that did fail. This chart simply shows all the techs that succdeded. 
Video phone was invented in the 60s. 4 wheel steering took off for a bit in the late 80s and 90s (my Prelude had it). Betamax was huge before it wasn't. HD-DVD. DVDs are dying and they reached 100%. Fax machines. List goes on and on and on.

Wow... too bad the majority of actual fiat being pumped into BTC is from Japan. And USD only accounts for 30% of fiat into BTC. So I mean your points may stand true for why there has been an overall increase in the USA, but I see NO ONE attempting to explain why Japan went from a single percent to pumping over 45% of all fiat into BTC seemingly overnight.

Sorry. This rant is not directed towards you.

I saw US government.... Well.in the last 18 months only 15%to 20% of the cash ( not trades) cash going into cryptocurreny came from the USA. So if the USA gets knocked out of cryptocurreny. So what. It will be like China. It will keep going. The vast majority of the cash that made the market go from 200 to 500 billion came from. Japan and Korea. So.....

Its basically a fast track to a masters in education in only 1 year to become a teacher. Catch was I needed to make up some extra classes. Okay... no big deal. How many? 3+ years plus  1 for a masters. I couldn't just take the content test for teaching chem. I had to get a SECOND fucking degree in chemistry PLUS the masters.

It is and it isn't. 
Its popular with big company and traders who already play the market. Not everyday plebs. For example there are 125 million people in Japan and 7 Bitcoin atms. There are 25 million people in Lithuania and 75 Bitcoin atms. Japan's biggest banks and insurance companies are dumping ungodly millions into the market. 
And yeah most of Japan is ass backwards, 30 years behind the west.

I guess... I would be lying if I said I didnt buy in to buy into the dream of getting rich. But I consider crypto a hobby of mine. That is why I first got in. With just 50$ to check out how everything worked. The exchanges. The hardware wallets. To get a up close seat of the action while I researched what the fuck a blockchain is (I still am not 100%). What mining means and does. So its a big intrest of mine and I enjoy learning about it. But now I have 20% of all my savings in crypto and mine AND I have dreams of getting rich as fuck. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 13:42:13
"Producing a single bitcoin now costs $4060 on average," where? Across the entire globe? So some places like Japan it would cost 8000 that means other places it would 2000. Places where it will cost 2000 are still going to mine BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:27:01
What is the rationale behind selling ASIC miners anyway. It seems like it would be so much more profitable to keep them use then. You are making money making machines, selling them for far less than you would make in just a few months.

Also If cash out over years you will pay less capital gains tax. You can quit you job and cash out 40k a year and pay nothing. Captial gains tax ranges from 0% to 30%. There is a ten trillion page Reddit post that explains pretty much anything you need to understand about cryptocurreny taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:39:22
I don't see how that is. Gold market cap it 7 trillion. ALL of crypto is 300 billion. So please explain to me how this works. Even if 1 trillion leaves gold and goes to crypto and BTC hit 1 trillion or 1.5 trillion, how would it go another 10x in price. I took economics about 20 years ago and got a D, so if someone can ELI5 how BTC could feasibly make it to 100 or 250K that would be awesome.

Its kinda funny... But so far I bought bitcoing at ATH and made 30% profit since then. Then I bought LTC at ATH and made 35% profit since then. Then I bought ETC at ATH and made... you guessed it 30% profit since then. Now ETH is ATH again and guess what? You guessed it I bought bought in again. Unless you are day trading just ignore ATH and invest at regular interval. If you really think crypto is "going to the moon" then we are still in the changing room not even on the bus yet to take us to the rocket.

You say people but why do you think places like trade volume is like 80% from Japan? Big Japanese compaines are buying btc for long haul invesment. Have you been watching the trades. You think ever day people are buying 200btc at 7k a piece?!?!  There may be a 1000 transactions a hour but a few hundred dollars here and there. 999 of those 1000 are a drop in a bucket compared to what the banks and insurance compaines are buying. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:57:38
No. Probably not. I both got in at 7400 which was insane and all time high. That was 3 weeks ago. 
That being said I have am probably done buying into btc and will focus on alt coins. What ever you decide I would diversify. So far I bought in LTC, BTC and ETH all at all time high. And all are returning about 50% profits for me. 
Let me put it this way. If you too late to the party, then we are all about to be sorry. I think most of us all ready in are expecting 3x returns soon. And dreaming of 10x returns if cryptocurreny goes main stream.

Steam accepts it ;) 
For years now. No one wants to spend BTC do they? That's the problem. One of them. Also someone was saying how buying a game off steam with btc costs like 4$ in fees. And then if you want a refund you lose another 4$. It's just not a good payment source. Now... If you the lambo dealership took BTC, that's a different story 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:51:03
I get that it's not good for the environment, but what job is. A shoe sales man still gets in his polluting car to go work in a mall with 50 trillion AC units and lights. Everyone wants to make money. Don't get me wrong, Bitcoins impact on the environment is bad and has made me more aware of my carbonfoot pribt. But people witch hunting BTC are jsit ongoing their own impact. 
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:37:47
I think you are totally missing it. Its that we still have hacks worth tens of millions of dollars!!! 
We have something that often jumps 5% every few hours. 
There are a fuck tons of obsticles to overcome. 
The fact that bitcoin survivor as well as it did after the 2017 bubble collapse (and has after 6 previous) says a lot. But until 4000 shit coins die and we have clear investment opportunities that aren't hack-able, we are a long way from this being taken serious enough. 
And I think shit coins are going to take WAY longer than many predicted to die. 
Look how many in the top 20 have dropped almost 90% in the last 2 years. And thats the top 20. They are still considered the TOP.

For me it was 7800. It dipped to 7400 I thought okay buy buy buy. Then it dropped down to like 6500 the next day. What an idiot right... Well now look at the price. I just made money. Maybe just watch the market a few days but don't wait too long. And you can buy other alt coins. But almsot everything is shooting straight up. I'm putting 1k in every month for long term. When you invest like that you pretty much just have to buy at market with the assumption it's going up in the long run. Your not wanting to day or even week trade are you? Then if you are in for years or decades BTC is going to hit 10k and the moon is the limit. I am litteraly gambling on the notion I can sneeze and what ever alt coin in the top 100 lands in will make money in the next couple years. Pick a few losers, so what one winner will make so much damn cash it probably won't matter. But I'm just an idiot with a cell phone.  So anyone else want to chime in? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:14:16
talk about a sandy vagina. 
That guy is just channeling his anger at all the people making money. Sure it might come crashing down, so what? Its not like i sold my house to buy in. Its play money. Play money that right now is making me serious fucking cash. Tons of people have already cashed out, buying them selves a paid vacation, a new car, a fucking house. RETIREMENT! 
And when BTC crashes, I am sure the money will go swooping into my alt coins giving me time to cash them out. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:13:29
That's why I think you should cash out little by little. First take out your original investment. Maybe 5-10% extra of compounded interest since that is what you would have made with traditional investing. Take out a little extra here and there, and leave in what? Half maybe. Because if it double again, then you right back where you started when you took out half. Not bad! 
@_date: 2019-12-17 01:29:53

not really. Rakuten is the biggest internet shop in Japan, followed by either Amazon.JP or Yahoo Shopping. 
DMM may have some online shopping but I sure don't use it. I never met a soul in Japan who does. So I don't know how big is can be.  Their main claim to fame is VOD stuff. If you go to DMM.com you can see its just  fuck loads of stuff. Just look on the left hand side. On the main page is mostly just VOD and apps and shit. 
Its kinda hard to imagine becuase I don't mess with shit like that, but its very smart phone oriented. So many people in Japan use their smart phone as their life.

Woah. Now. Slow down bro. 
I am actually willing to listen to your delusional ideas. 
First explain to me your big gigantic plan and lets go from there. I really want to hear the first successful plan ever to dodge taxes. Because you sound like the first person to maybe actually be able to pull it off. You found a way around the FBAR it seems and  Form 114 filing. 
I am totally following you about starting a company overseas. 100% I am on your page. So next let me know how you get around the the FBAR requirements? What country are you starting this country in? And you relizese tranfer of funds from one country to another, company or private or not, you still pay taxes. 
And I don't live in Alabama. but nice try. 
But honestly, I REALLY REALLY want to hear your master plan on all this. 
Where are you starting this company. How much are you paying to set it up? How are you getting your funds back to the USA without paying taxes on the, because the USA double taxes income made outside the USA over 98k. You have to pay someone to set the company up right? Or are you going to be able to file all that paperwork yourself? Again. FBAR. how are you getting past that? Because the fine for not filing an FBAR start at 10,000$. 
So money coming into the USA has to be accounted for period. and if it comes from a foreign company, which is fine, it has to be in someone's name. whose name is it going to be. 
And when you bring this money back to the USA, how do you explain where you got it? You are just going to bring it 9,999$ in cash at a time on a 10000 airplane flights. Or when transfer larger amounts,  you have to declare it as income, and pay tax on it. So still, I don't see how you are getting around paying tax on it. You have not explained a single thing to me. I LOVE learning about this stuff, so I honestly, sincerely want you to explain it to me as sucentiutly as you can.

Everything goes straight to my Trezor. Which is locked in a safe. 
I don't even trade, mine, or buy coins that don't go straight to my Trezor. I'm too scared I'll fuck something up. I can barely pretend to understand why my Trezor is safe.

I am a US citizen and coinbase wont let me join because all I have is a passport, SS card, valid birth certificate and cc bill to my legal resident. None of those are considered proof of my citizenship to the USA. WTF.

nothing you said makes any sense whatsoever. Its a fairytale. How would you ever use crypto with out fiat in your lifetime. You are dreaming of a world run by the silk road. It will never happen. You are living in a William Gibson novel and fucking delusional. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:41:33
No. Not for a decade. 
But I have legal residents there. Am a US citizen. Have a passport. Pay taxes on investments there with my US SS number. 
I have emailed them twice and they just fucking ignore more. They say on their website they wont take passports. I emailed them and offered them my birth certificate. My SS card. Bills to my house. They wont even respond to me.

So why isnt anyone talking about BTG? 
I can't get on Coinbase. They are being lame. I have a US passport but they wont take that! 
I am Japan top two exchanges. Coincheck and BitFlyer. They have both put out statments about the BTG and how they are keeping BTC as BTC and Gold as BTG. We will get same shares of both if we have BTC with them. 
That is what Coinbase is saying about B2X. So I am going to BTC, BTG, and B2X after all these forks are done?!

Its REALLY easy to pay 0 tax. That isnt the problem. Are you a child? Are you talking 5k or 10K. You are probalby fine. 
You need to fucking educate yourself. Its simple. If you are in the USA for example and you cash out any crypto over 10k a redflag is sent to the IRS. people get red flags ALL the time for all sorts of things. Its not a big deal. 
You deposit more than 10k in your bank. Red flag gets sent to the IRS. The IRS sometimes looks into these flags. If they see you took out 10k and see you didnt pay any taxes on it. Boom big fucking fine. If they see you deposited 10k into your account and you only make 50k a year, they may audit you and ask where did the 10k come from. you HAVE to explain. You cant just make up a story. Sold a car? Where is the proof. Found in a bag? doesnt matter you have to pay tax on found cash. you cant prove where it comes from. Big fine. 
Now assuming you are a child and we arnt talking anything over 10k then you are fine. Enjoy life. good bye.

Whatever. You are troubled if you worry about getting your bitcoins robbed by gunpoint. You just as likely to get robbed for 20$ cash to your phone. People smart enough know what bicoons are and smart enough to steal them arnt going to use a gun, genious. They are going to hack them or scan you out of them. There are more than enough people online to scan with out putting yourself in danger with a gun. Craiglist: "hey want to buy my used car. Just send the bitcoins.... Okay thanks. Good-bye." Bam j just stole tour bitncoins and no one will ever see my face. Bro.... Use your head.

Whats the deal with ATMs? I live in Japan. The closest [one in Osaka is]( selling BTC for like 20% over market value AND 12% fees. 
I thought Japan was all about some BTC.
The ones in Tokyo are a little better with around 6 to 10% fee. 
I really don't get it. I just read an article about how Japan is the new king of of BTC beating out China in terms of total volume trades. Yet there are only half a dozen ATMs and half a dozen cash serivce places. Yet a place like Lithuania has over 70 cash/ATMs services. What am I missing here?

some newbie questions: I want to start investing say 50$ a month into bitcoins. I don't really plan using my bitcoins to buy everyday or even monthly purchases. I want it for savings and eventually currency exchange transfers. (I transfer a good amount of money between Japan and USA and pay a lot of fees, this will be cheaper). 
I want to get a hardware wallet. But I am not 100% clear on wallet. Can I transfer my balance easily from wallet to wallet? I am thinking of getting a PC wallet first then ordering a hardware wallet. And in 10 years or 20 or 30 surely these hardware wallets will need to be upgraded to USB-D and Omega or whatever is down the line. I am thinking of long long term storage options. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:03:27
I am new to BTC. Just bought some BTC a few times in the last couple weeks. Its a steep learning curve... 
Um... are these forks free money? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:42:48
200 bucks stress? 
I have tens of thousands in index funds. You have to just buy and it and forget it. 
I am trying to get into BTC... 200 is nothing. I loose and gain that much in single day with my stocks. I don't mean to sound like I am rich. I work very hard to invest the little I have, I am just saying... 200 is nothing when it comes to investments. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:16:47
or worse yet. they might get robbed by gunpoint by BTC bandits roaming the streets. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:47:45
isn't this what hardware wallets are for? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:06:40
Well... A hardware wallet has a very long pin code. So you will have to crack that as well. 
There is also a seed. So if they steal your hardware wallet you use that seed to regenerate your wallet with all its coins. 
You can put that seed in a safe, with the wallet, a differnt safe, give a copy to your parents to put in their safe. In a bank box. 
With a hardware wallet there is simply no way for a thief to steal your BTC. and as long as you keep your seed safe you can ALWAYS get your BTC back. 
And yeah. Sure a gun to the head can force someone to give them your money. But that goes for any many in any form. That is a bit crazy. 
Read like two seconds about hacking a bitcoin wallet. Its impossible in the lifetime of the universe even with a computer powered by all the energy of the sun. (give me 2 seconds while I try to find the post that explains this) (edit: still looking but for todays methods it would take 464656656565656566565646367618239128323718298319239129309 years to brute force a BTC wallet).
Edit 2: damn, I cant find it, I saw this really good explanation using the power of the sun and the number of combination and the most powerful coimnptuer that could ever be constructed ever ever ever would take longer to brute force a key than the entire time the universe has left. 
this is the best I could find

How are they going to know you have bit coins?!?!??! You need to be more worried that someone is going to rob you of CASH. you are a nutter.

So overwhelmed right now. Just a few questions while I wait for verification of my accounts to start buying. Okay.... So I got my Trezor all set up.... now what? No seriously. 
I live in Japan and want to be able to buy some BTC in yen and some in USD and some with CC and maybe in cash oneday (I looked there about 15 places in Japan that deal in cash). 
So I signed up for 3. Coinbase, Coinmama, and Coincheck. Coinbase won't verfiy me as a US citizen becuase they dont take US passports... go figure (I am waiting to hear back from support). Coinmama and Coincheck are verifying my stuff so that I can go ahead and buy in YEN. 
1. So when I do actually make a purchase how do I get it into my Trezor? 
2. If I want to buy BTC with cash, how does that work with a hardware wallet like Trezor? Android app with USB cable? 
3. I transfer yen to USD and am really sick of the fees and the exchange rate. I want to go YEN to BTC to USD, what is the cheapest way to do that? How do I link my US bank and Japan bank with BTC in the middle? 
Sorry for all the questions, I had no idea BTC had such a steep learning curve. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:58:13
awesome! planning on buying a Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:15:24
Now seems like a good time. Didnt BTC just hit an insane record high. like 8% growth just in the lsat 24 hours. Insane.
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:15:50
Wow. You are a real nutter. 
I am not angry at all. You are the one yelling and name calling. Just calm down bro and think for two seconds. 
When you go out on the street do you take every penny you have with you? Why not, becuase you might lose it, or someone might rob you. 
So if you have TONS of bitcoins why would you keep them all in one wallet? If I had say 100 bitcoins, I would keep them in 5 different wallets. And if somehow someone knew I had bitcoins, which will never happen unless they live in your fantasy land then they hold me up with a gun (never will happen, but lets pretend) then you hand them over the .00005 BTC you have in your travel wallet. And they are never the wiser to the half a dozen hardware wallets stashed around you house or apt. 
Its that simple. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:47:33
Its not really a big deal right now I guess. 
I make my cash in yen, so will buy in Yen. I guess if I ever move back I will have their fucking drivers licence and can open an account with them to cash out my coins in dollars. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:25:58
bro... whatever. You are being way too paranoid. Someone would have to know that you are even holding a lot of BTC. Why would anyone know that? Do you where a T-shirt with your balance on it? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:08:15
Seriously, with the year BTC just had. How can people with a straight face seriously dish on crypto so bad. I get that its a gamble. So are stocks and index funds. But if you want to retire a millionaire with a 50k salary it isn't going to come from praying and wishful thinking. 
I guess I shouldn't be surprised when 80% of the USA has less than 2k in liquid saving and most people don't have a penny saved for retirement. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 07:49:01
It has nothing to do with "picking sides". There is nothing "wrong" with BCH its just that Ver is misresenting and tricking and scamming people into buying it. He is getting sued for it. So do you really want to support a "side" that is littearly trying to scam the less informed people out there. In turn bring a bad name to BCH and BTC and Cryptocurrency. Get rid of Ver, then whatever buy all the BCH you want, but until then I wont support that shit.

So is Malaysia which is fucking amazing! An Islamic country no less. They are very libral though, yet have very strict laws. So I think recently someone was out on jail for life for dealing weed and finally people said hold on a fucking sec. And they are actually discussing medical marijuana legalization. Japan will be the last fucking country in Asia to legalize it.
@_date: 2018-12-19 08:00:09
Woah... America is Draconian? Try coming to Asia. In the last time someone in the government (edit: sorry forgot to type Japan. She was a council women from Okinawa) suggested they maybe talk about looking at the possibility of considering allowing TESTING on medical marijuana, they had here arrested on bull shit charges (some dude in a hotel she owned had weed, so they threw her in jail).
