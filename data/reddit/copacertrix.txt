It is worth noting that TTR moved from Malta to Italy lately and that it is one of the oldest exchange still active (2011)

He denies being Satoshi in any possible way.
Can you produce code and works like he did and do?
You are using his political view (the political view that millions of american have) to  talk about his contributions to crypto, does that sound logic to you? You don't like his retweets? don t look at them. You think.his work is not rock solid? Then you need to prove it. BtW you forgot to mention his retweets about libertarians matters. 
The fact that you wanted Hillary Clinton as President doesn t give you the right to question the work of people who didn t vote like you.

Actually I think it s more free marketing for podcast and for him. Why asking questions would be brigading?

You understand that in the community  even Jihan Wu noted that there is confusion between addresses? SOFTWARE developers usually help people avoiding confusion. Your software goes in the opposite direction and instead  of  helping users with predictable default choices, proposes the less known fork. If you add the fact that looking at Bitcoin cash ' s codes on github it s almost all line codes duplicated from bitcoin... well you can understand the confusion. Do you feel fine developing a software that tries to pass the concept as a "Lamborghini Fast" claiming its the true lambo?

There was a post on another sub... Like every 3 month there are post of Satshi's quotes takenout of context, reminders of Greg's story with wikipedia, luke's expression of his faith, Amir's behaviour in Vienna... Adam Back can have opinions on how to scale and those may or may not chance.  ANOTHER real life example on the fact that bitcoin's github development is not at service of any CEO

Sadly not true, most of that sub stillthink CSW is a petson worth listening to.

Again, my comment was about the post. Example: if there s a post about "bitcoin makes you getting rich while sitting doing nothing in your mum s basement" it s a shitpost, but doesn t mean i imply bitcoin is a scam
