I think bitcoin will be back to $5.5k after the fork in 2 weeks. Him selling now isn't a bad idea. 'Risking it' in this context is holding your bitcoin into the drop and needing the money anyways and forcing yourself to sell when its cheap.

It goes down by about 2% every year, and within 30 years it halves. Not as bad as every year but still pretty terrible.

They're starting to become scarce... some hiding away that they ever supported him, just like Nixon.

Then you'd be significantly increasing the risk of being hacked, youre just lowering how much they would take.
