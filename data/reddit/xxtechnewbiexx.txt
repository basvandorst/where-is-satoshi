I learned from my mistake. When the price was dropping to 7.6K, I sold right at the lowest thinking that it was gonna go lower. Turns out, it went back up and I never saw 7.6K again. After holding the USDC for a few weeks, I bought at 7.9K and bit my losses as a lesson.

Agreed, people expect these “long term” investments to be only a few days as if they were on that water planet from Interstellar (where 1 hour there was 7 years back on Earth)

You and I are in the same boat. Crazy how many days it takes to get your money on Pro compared to regular Coinbase. While I do think BTC will go over 10k, I’m hoping we see another 7K so we all can make that last minute purchase.

I’m all in for 10k but I welcome 6k so I can buy more.

So that dump that took BTC from 10K to 7.7K led to me to make decisions with my emotions and traded BTC to tether to prevent any further loss. To my luck, it went immediately back up to a steady 8K. Granted I only had 0.256 to play with but any loss is a bad loss. Now I’m stuck on whether to hold on until, if it even happens, BTC goes back down to 7K or just bite my losses and get back in.

Definitely, I’ll stick to buying dips
