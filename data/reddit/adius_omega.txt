It's basically using computational power to solve extremely difficult mathematical equations to verify funds between two people.

send me a .75 btc and ill draw you a picture of a hot dog in ms paint.

I feel a bit better knowing that I can instantly convert my bitcoin to fiat in the event that things go south (and I have a feeling that if/when it does if will happen fast)
While a trezor or ledger is much much more secure, if the market were to crash good luck getting your transactions sent over the blockchain, it gets congested way too easily. It would be very unlikely you could get out in time, but then again they are more for hodlers

Unless bitcoin reaches 4 million per coin I won't be a millionaire. 
Would be way slick though I tell you what.

I bought in at 5k and I feel like I'm playing some sort of passive game where I'm somehow winning.

They are just believers.
If your going to dream, dream big?

The downside the the ledger is that if you wanted to "cash out" during a crisis like the market is failing then it's likely the blockchain would be too tied up to send a transaction within time to an exchange.
That's the only downside I can tell so far.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:56:12
It also helps I'm sure that the network isn't congested at all.

Unfortunately you have to consider the fees you will be paying and also the tax you will need to pay on those short term capital gains. Not a very feasible option to do what you want to do.

I knew something was wrong there
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:43:02
Ahh, helps to read that shit eh?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:49:07
Agh always gotta be rich pricks involved with everything.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:41:26
Just for reference it was around $1k the beginning of this year.

You're safe, Coinbase is federally insured up to $250,000. 
Although things like coinbase don't really have a very good track record, look up things like the Mt. Gox incident.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:52:34
Just use Coinbase if you're new and eventually research into "cold storage" like a Trezor USB stick or something.
Coinbase is insured.

Oh man don't use the word "cuck" that just completely invalidates anything you are saying. I believe you but I just feel dirty with the agreement.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:45:58
Wow that's actually pretty nuts if that's the case. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:10:53
$100 isn't really a sizeable investment. Most people have that disposable and it's honestly a risk worth taking.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:18:20
It's a movement in the right direction. Transparency is a powerful asset.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:53:59
When it goes, it goes.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:30:16
Hyusung agrees.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:05:45
I don't understand how it's hard to lose money day trading bitcoin.
Like you have to be doing some serious over-thinking to fuck that up. It's trend it literally going one way and that is up.
Bitcoin hits $7600 and then drops to $7200? Buy, it's absolutely going to surpass $7600 inevitably.
I don't understand how people think it's so hard unless I'm missing something...
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:59:48
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:14:29
Really curious to see where it's all going to be sitting this time next year.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:53:39
Or maybe he just wants bitcoin to thrive and in order to do that we need to let people know the idea exists.
Or maybe it's all a !~!CONSPIRACY!~
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:28:10
Holy shit, this is the kind of news people wanna hear.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:07:44
for now, but you can still buy stuff with it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:16:23
I don't, because then I'd be rich as fuck and that would be so lame.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:12:18
No fun aloud 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:40:52
Ok I will send a signal. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:24:01
What a fucking weenie.
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:28:26
This is why you call and have a password setup through your carrier to be able to make any changes, unless the theives somehow figure this out they can't change the SIM.
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:30:46
Well your first problem is your using words like "shill"
