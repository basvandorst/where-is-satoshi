you can do the same 
What you get in return: Their service is oriented for gaming, for torrent-users, and they've got reaaaaly cheap, and reaaly high speed VPN (1GBit channel! And it really works, I've tested through my Moscow servers), to give you idea: you can purchase monthly subscription for static ip for 0.006 BTC $1.5 (prices converted from rubles), you can purchase account with dynamic IP for 0.01 BTC $2.5 (not the best pool, just 100 IP-addresses but still good enough) and 0.013 BTC $3.3 for the torrent VPN with dynamic IP, with a direct connection (which means you can host anything) this prices are just for month.
Not intended to advertise anything, because you can't pay them anyway before they accept something viable, because of their payment problem. And I'm not exaggerating anything, try paying them with credit card - you'll see its impossible to make a payment (while you still can pay them through WebMoney weird stuff)
Could there be any reason for such small companies to be afraid of inviting more customers "from abroad"? Are Russians still living in a "quota"-based society (like in Soviet Union?)

I got interested in minecraft when I've found some guy on YouTube making computers using redstone. I asked him a question, why he won't build ECDSA algorithm to create Blockchain addresses in Minecraft, but he said that its kinda impossible, because Minecraft is too slow for that.
Kinda disappointing. So my task now is to find out some not complicated way of making mining machines in minecraft, which players could build in game, but without possibility to cheat using outside world automation.
E.g. if you're going to build a SHA-256 using redstone it will be slow enough to compete with ASIC miners.
The whole point is about making another ALTcoin but using tools within minecraft, and building minecraft economy upon it. If everything will be automated it won't even need a lots of players.
One sentence:
**I need to figure out some mathematical concept to make mining algorithm within game without ability to cheat from outside**
There's examples on how you can do the same process in paper: 
His conclusion is:


If SHA-256 is easy to do by hand, then probably it will be easy using RedStone, isn't it?
I'm curious, because, no one done this in minecraft before! At least I've tried hard searching such tutorials on YouTube both in Russian (my native language) and English

I think its way more practical than just making a faucet.

ELI5 how they can operate without BitLicense? Doesn't every NY company obligated to be regulated under BitLicense and required to acquire it to have such a serious money transmitting Bitcoin business?
Are Winklevoss brothers planning to work without BitLicense even if BitLicense will become mainstream?
@_date: 2015-10-12 22:18:34
As far as I know, money transmitter license is needed by those companies who deal with cash. And BitLicense is needed for those companies who deals with Bitcoins, right? 
So I just didn't got how they can avoid getting BitLicense? Isn't rules ain't written for everybody?

This is just an idea, and I suppose it could use Bitcoin's multisig for deposits.
Main idea is providing people the way to monetize their rides on the go by letting them grab delivery packages from 1 subway station to another, and in exchange getting free rides + BTC bonuses.
If you have any ideas on how to make it more real - I'd welcome that. Also it would be nice if you could insert any questions or grammar improvements right in the document (its made publicly editable)

probably making ecdsa auth system for such purposes is too much.
Maybe in-game nicknames ( = mentioning nickname in command blocks can support commands e.g. giving someone an item) would work.

really awesome news

I think at some point some blockchain-hero will appear at some point and will start showing how to disrupt industry and decapitate intermediaries heads. He's gonna save their day. Let's wait.
@_date: 2015-10-05 13:18:18
maybe you've got any ideas on how to make such mechanism?
Basically you can build computer using command blocks. Maybe first logical step would be creating more simpler ecdsa protocol which would be fast enough for building it on command blocks?
Then without modifying game people in game would be able to sign something cryptographically.
@_date: 2015-10-05 13:15:59
yeah but I'm mostly concentrated on making an alternative blockchain system in minecraft for gaming purposes
I want my blockchain to work only in game, and I want players not being able to transfer those mechanisms outside of the game or cheat anyhow other ways.
In other words I want to create a minecraft cryptocurrency inside the game using only game features: e.g. command_blocks etc without using any mods (or maybe some inventory mods, but not related to mining calculations itself)

its funny how everybody in this room believed that Bitcoin is a company.
