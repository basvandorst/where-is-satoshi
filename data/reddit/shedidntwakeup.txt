I’m sorry to hear about your brother OP. It really sucks that someone would place so much worth in money... Especially since it sounds like he sold out his Bitcoin. That’s the thing about investments (of any kind); there’s always a chance it’s going to go up and you’ll loose money. 
My parents raised me to put a lot of emphasis on money. My dad grew up a poor Dutch-Indo/Taiwanese immigrant and my mother, while from a relatively affluent family, lived in the very country side of Japan, which is a pretty poor area. My parents met in Japan, but because my mom married an American, she was disowned. They were both poor and had to work extra hard to make ends meet. Luckily my dad is one of the smartest guys I know, and he ended up becoming a stocks broker, making over $700,000 a year by his mid 30s and my mom stayed home and raised my brother and I. 
So my parents always told me money was pretty much everything. “If you don’t have a career and money, you’re either lazy, stupid, or both.” That mixed with the condescending parenting style of a Japanese mother and a father who thought working to provide for family was more important than providing emotional nurture, I grew up thinking money would solve all my problems. 
Flash forward a bit; I was gifted 5BTC when it was still about $350. I was pretty happy when I sold most of it for $800. Recently I checked my Coinbase account and saw Bitcoin went up to over $10,000. The $50 I left in there is over $600 the last time I checked. Am I sad about it? Yeah, I could have had over $50,000. That’s enough to pay my rent for the next 4ish years. But it was my choice to sell it when I did. If I had waited longer I could have had more money than I’ve ever had in my bank account (don’t judge, I’m only 20yo) but I didn’t, and that’s okay too. 
I’m really sorry about you brother OP. Thanks for sharing your story and may he Rest In Peace.
