No. If they have a gun held at you, sure, *that* kind of threat would qualify. But if someone emails you to say "I'm going to kill you" and you hunt them down and shoot them in the head, that is not self defense. The correct response is to contact the police.

sha256crypt is not the same thing as normal salted SHA-256. Their use of 7500 rounds means attacking it will be ~7500 times slower than raw SHA-256 (1 round).

 B - Moral Issues
While moral issues are outside the traditional scope of a whitepaper such as this, we feel compelled to raise them. 
Modest success of this protocol could make early investors (and even those who simply hold bitcoins) very rich, hopefully without much disruption to the rest of the world. However, should this protocol and its children (or perhaps some other similar protocol) become more than modestly successful and start to replace traditional currencies, the consequences could be huge, possibly even apocalyptic. Early investors could be the richest people in the world, maybe even trillionaires by today’s accounting. The social and economic upheaval could be cataclysmic, and many people could suffer greatly if the transition is not handled well by governments and the new rich.
We urge our readers to examine their hearts, and to engage in more constructive fantasies than buying fast cars and private islands. Are you willing to devote the vast majority of your wealth to helping people in need, especially those who suffer because of the forces that made you rich? Will you pursue new entrepreneurial projects which create jobs for these people? Will you help your government adapt to the new paradigm? Will the world be a better place because of your good fortune? The suffering of these people will be on all of our heads, and they (and a higher power) will hold us accountable if we behave selfishly.
In such a world, we must all encourage each other to do the right thing, by words and by example.

They spent the entire show interviewing the guy who bought 300,000BTC @ 0.01 and asking him his opinion on whether or not the trades should be rolled back. [While paying him almost no attention]( Unsurprisingly he was in favor of him making money.
The second host knew almost nothing about the crash. He stated this outright. Not really clear why he was even there.
And "unpolished"? They went on the air before they had their guest, before they were at their positions, anything. They were doing live equipment tests and the main host was getting mad about the problems they were having getting going. [Their camera still goes into demo mode](


The guys at Tradehill were uncomfortable being asked questions about security in the last show because *they know nothing about security*. The guy at M:TG OX is uncomfortable because he got hacked and is trying to cover his ass so crazy people don't sue and/or murder him.

No. MD5 is a general purpose hash function, it isn't encryption. It's designed to be extremely fast.

No it isn't. He literally wants the old trial thrown out completely, this is not an appeal. If this fails, *then* there will be an appeal.
At least from my brief research which contained "Such a motion is seldom granted, (particularly if the judge heard the case without a jury) unless there is some very clear error which any judge would recognize. Some lawyers feel the motion helps add to the record of argument leading to an appeal of the case to an appeals court."

What actually happened: 
* Redditor's friend's father, **a Muslim religious leader who the FBI was interested in**, passes away
* Redditor posts in askreddit about how easy it would be to bomb a mall
* Redditor and his friend find GPS tracking device on the friend's car
* Redditor posts it on reddit
* FBI shows up at friend's house, shows friend printout of bomb post and demands GPS device returned
* Techdirt claims it was the redditor's post that led to the friend being tracked by FBI
Techdirt obviously has a really dumb interpretation of cause and effect, here. The most obvious reason he was being tracked is not a reddit post.
Also, I told you this years ago and you are still using the same misleading link. I suspect you care more about clickbait than truth.

It was in the trial. His defense's argument was that somebody (Mark Karpeles IIRC) planted it via BitTorrent. However it contained very personal information, like when Ross admitted to a friend that he founded the Silk Road and then lied to that friend and said he sold it off.

reddit is very clear about their position: subreddits are dictatorships. If they want to ban all articles about a certain subject, that's fine. If they want to ban all users who have a certain letter in their username, that's fine. If you don't like it, make your own subreddit. They aren't going to change this.
(subreddits may be removed/not picked as a default due to their rules, of course, which is why is no longer a default)
