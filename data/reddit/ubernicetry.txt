Here is what is happening:
The US Central Bank (The Fed) is not going going to scale back Quantitative Easing (QE) in September; it is QE to infinity, as more money will be continually pumped into the system. However, in order to keep the apprearace of dollar stability, Emerging Market (EM) currencies are being forced to devalue (i.e. print money) their currencies relative to the USD at an even FASTER rate than the Fed is doing. This causes people to flee foreign currencies, if favor of the USD dollar. Thus, inflation is happening all over the world at the same time, yet with the appearance of stability. Eventually, all of the currencies of the world are to be designed to collapse in order for the global elites to usher in a new world order and completely enslave everyone and steal all their wealth.
Because the EM currencies are being devalued, they are starting to panic sell and rush to convert to what appears to be more stable money (i.e. USD)
But, since Bitcoin is a global free-market currency, the manipulation techniques are not able to be disguised. The result is that any money printing or destabilization in any currency anywhere in the world, ultimately will convert to increase in BTC. Today was a turbulent day for EM currencies as many are being inlfated away at quicker pace.
Brazilian Real, Argentine Peso, Indian Rupee, Thai Baht and others.... are all losing value compared to USD. This causes the USD to appear to deflate rather than inflate.
The truth is they are all being inflated away.
