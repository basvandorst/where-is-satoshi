Because this is Bitcoin.  It is a solution looking for a problem that does not exist.  Without all the fanfare and reinventing of the wheel, there is nothing left of these revolutionary products but fancy buzzwords and empty wallets.  Literally no company has had any success, let alone a profit, with bitcoin endevors except exchanges who just steal everyone's money when they run out.

That is a slippery slope.  There is literally no idea in the realm of bitcoin that is not "x but with bitcorn".  Every idea is about shoehorning bitcoin into something that you can already do easier without it.  In other words, there is not a single viable use that provides any benefits to anyone other than drug dealers and governent fearing sovereign citizens.  It is a solution for a problem that doesn't exist except in the minds of the nutty libertarians.

Totally agree.  It is astounding how blind people have become with this hold at all cost mindset.  No one has ever invested with the goal of being a bagholder, they  invested saying the exact same things trumpeted here.  OP has nothing to be proud of.  Make no mistake, Bitcoin is a zero sum game and there will be losers.  So while the sheep reassure each other by chanting hodl, others are getting the fuck out while the gettin is good.  The technology may have merit but please don’t be deluded into ignoring common sense like OP.  History doesn’t make a bit of difference here.

@_date: 2018-01-24 01:03:43
With no fees and quick confirmations, bitcoin was 10% of volume and went  slowly down from there.  What you are suggesting is that they dedicate respurces to 10% of volume but alternatively, those resources could be allocated to supporting/experimenting the other major volume sources (i.e.  maybe one volume segment is 75% of their overall business).  
Legit Businesses like Stripe are not going to dedicate resources to gamble on what was proven to be at most 10% of volume.  It just isnt worth their time at this point. 
 If more people use it for micro payments they will come back around but “experimenting” on bitcoin makes no sense.  The success of micropayments using bitcoin is conjecture right now and they have other major revenue sources to experiment on.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:19:34
Lets apply your awesome logic in reverse, is any criticism with “some validity” always FUD to you?   If I did research and found what I thought was evidence of an upcoming terror attack, and then the FBI came in and said that there is some validity to my concern, I would say that it makes my concern valid right?  Or am I just spreading FUD? I think you need to look up the definition of valid.
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:21:59

You are starting at “Step 2” and that first step is not trivial.  To send bitcoins you have to have some.  Virtually every method to buy bitcoins requires a ton of steps,  dealing with exchanges, or other general risks like OTC trades.  Goodluck with doing that without some combination of an ID, passports, bank accounts, and fees. 
Now assuming you have some and are able to send them, getting Bitcoin is just not the same as wiring fiat which is the implication you are making - not even close.   Very limited *direct* uses of bitcoins make that “instant” transfer ability pretty pointless if you can’t do anything with them.  
 Disingenuous posts like this just make bitcoin seem like something a snakeoil salesman would peddle.  
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:56:32


This makes no sense.  Taking this at face value, he is assuming that most people would ever care enough to make a choice. Anyone who is not concerned with ideology will pick the quickest and easiest option (which would hopefully be an “auto route”). 
As far as actual centralization goes, what about the requirements to be a hub? Are there not barriers to entry that would naturally restrict just anyone from firing up a new and equally popular hub? If there are barriers, how  could a system ever be anything but centralized?


Is this something that they should even be concerned with?   I thought the entire crux of the LN was that the technology and process would fade into the background leaving the user largely unaware of the underlying routing etc. 
These arguments really seem to boil down to “well we included the option to select a route so... decentralized... check”.

The level of cognitive dissonance here regarding banks is hilarious.  One minute they are the enemy and the next there is a euphoric post about one doing something with bitcoin, as if it were some great event.  Case in point, you have this post entitled “fuck the banks” while at the top of the sub is a post about a bank in argentina and bitcoin.  Everyone applauds banks who are entering the space when you would expect the absolute opposite since those bankers are the enemy.  I mean if banks are the enemy for you guys, wouldn’t you want them to stay the hell out and not support any “investment” or traditional bankers looking into bitcoin? Or did all of that idealism go out the window when this became all about price (in $USD)? 
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:04:37
So is the fundamental decentralization of the LN based on giving users an option to choose a route that avoids a specific hub they may not like?  If so,  it just seems a bit of a stretch to assume that mass adoption era users would care about that and that indifference would cement the popular hubs in their position.  Am I thinking about it wrong?  
Wouldn’t a hub need an increasing amount of funds to compete for traffic (if that was their goal)? 
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:26:36

Explain how dollar cost averaging a small number of transactions over a month is useful again?  Dollar cost averaging seems only practical when you are dealing with  thousands of transactions over something like a day - like a high frequency day trader.  
If OP is opening and closing thousands of positions and need to somehow calculate his standing after closing out for the day, I would get that.  But if OP made 2 transactions over a month, meaning he would easily know the literal price paid in each transaction, and when he closes out he could calculate exact profits etc.  So why are you recommending the dollar cost average?
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:35:18
Yeah I have never understood a blockchain without bitcoin or what is so revolutionary.  If they drop all the buzzwords and just develop a better database system they will save a lot of money and trouble.  Reminds me of a software vendor trying to market a new technology to old traditional companies and making a mountain out of a molehill to imply all of the complexity is "necessary" in order to charge outrageous prices.

After some thought, I guess if it were *between* different banks that may make sense.  Within the same bank though, even between offices or anything else, a centralized database would make more sense as there would be no trust issues.

@_date: 2016-01-06 20:46:56
My entire point was not that things are hopeless but saying there is more reason than ever to be optimistic is ridiculous given all the issues.
The number of wallets or transactions? You might as well say the number of users in a forum (don't look at those in this sub if you want good news) or some other meaningless figure.  
The positive tone from the media? Anecdotally, the little non-crypto blog media coverage in articles I have seen is related to the blockchain and certainly not bitcoin. 
Remember what happened last time BitCoin entered the mainstream spotlight? It was Bitpay's miserable failure to hold the Bit Coin Bowl and make that town the pinnacle of Bit-coin  integration ever.  Bowl didn't happen, no one spent BitCoin at any store, they all dropped it, BitPay is now laying off employees.

So in order for Lightning to work:
* we need to prevent fraud
* to prevent fraud, we need enough watchtowers
* either enough people will just run them or we won't have enough watchtowers 
* to get enough watchtowers, we need to incentivize them
* to incentivize them, we have to pay watchtowers 
* to pay watchtowers, it has to be done **privately**
* to pay them privately, we have to create a new ecash token
Ok... So the effectiveness of this version of watchtowers depends on enough people running them (at a loss).  Their solution to incentivize people to run them (later release) right now involves... creating a new token to pay them because it has to be done privately?

The only reason the price increased to begin with was due to Mark Karpeles' scheme to pump the price with bots on Mt. Gox.  It was not demand and it was certainly not increased adoption.  
Virtually every single startup surrounding bitcoin has either failed or on a fast track to failure.  There are simply no profitable enterprises in Bitcoin.  The VC money **will** dry up and then where will the funding come from? 
The only people left pumping bitcoin are doing so because they are just learning about it, driven by ideology, or underwater.   The in-fighting in the community is making it even worse.  The bottom line is that Bitcoin does not solve any non-ideological problem,  the ship is sinking, and anyone who thinks otherwise is either delusional or dishonest.

Finally, collect $5 million in VC and then pay yourself a salary of $1 million a year while you "build" your idea.  Occasionally post vague updates on your site or reddit if you have time.  After two years, just make a farewell post on your site about something about the traditional banking system and include a thank you.  It is that easy! No coding or even knowledge needed!

Fair enough and thanks for the reply.  He uses bitcoin.com to bash reddit and this subreddit quite openly and then use this very place to generate traffic for the site.  I guess if he isn't breaking rules like you outlined the scumbag can post but he nor his site are anything but bad news for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:24:28
He is a relentless self-promoting scumbag who is only interested in personal gain through any means.  Sociopathic people like him take advantage of people like you and are master manipulators through and through.  
The guy profited off of Mt. Gox while no one else could.  He likely led many people like yourself to lose money.   He has no belief in "fundamentals" except winning at all cost.  He relentlessly spams this subreddit with links to his own terrible website because he makes profit from it.  It has nothing to do with censorship or anything.  He openly doxed someone using access to blockchain.info user database, which then banned him, that owed him $50.   He is a convicted felon after storing explosives in his apartment for christ sake.  Make all the excuses you want, but at the end of the day it will be at your own expense.
**He, and people like him, are a plague on anything they touch and the sooner you people wake up to it the better off you will be.**

You should put a warning on all your spam AMA posts that if a user registers on bitcoin.com they are subject to full doxing if they cross you (or owe you $50).  Also a disclaimer you are a convicted felon might be useful too.

Truly shocking Jimmy.  Based on the strange sequence of events, I would deduce their priorities are focused on "making money".  Unfortunately, a business spending time supporting tens of rabid bitcoin hodlers isn't exactly "revenue generating".  Especially considering you hodlers don't actually spend tokens as has been shown time and time again.  Hell bitcoin companies themselves only earn money from fees and clearly not enough to keep most from pivoting away from the tokens once their VC runs out.  I wouldn't hold my breath Jimmy.

He openly puts this subreddit on blast through the bitcoin.com blog, opens his own alternate btc subreddit because he whines about this one, and now he is spam advertising the AMAs on his crap site hat he is trying to tout as the new censorship free place to discuss bitcoin.  Now you are telling me that this altruistic chap is just innocently promoting a site?
@_date: 2015-11-08 00:11:49
Are you high? Letting some anonymous dude pay a few satoshis to browse CP and buy drugs through my hotspot? That sounds like it will work out about as well as when  u/memorydealers decided to mail explosives via USPS.

Why are these guys allowed to post this spam here? I am genuinely curious.  Roger Ver clearly just wants to promote his website anad make money.
@_date: 2015-11-06 17:35:23
He also owns a bitcoin bounty site and has openly doxed users of another site he ran who crossed him (e.g. owed him $50) in the past.  I would think twice about giving this guy, who is a convicted felon, any personal info or using his site.  
Also his twitter profile picture is an image of himself quoting himself.
@_date: 2015-10-12 17:53:04
Exactly.  
There are so many who can benefit from Bitcoin's superior ease of use, security, speed, and transaction fees.  
Sure no one accepts it directly and you would need to convert it to giftcards or some other medium to use it but that is what is so great about Bitcoin.  You can help support both merchants and the additional layer of third party companies that you must deal with.   
I am sick of all these naysayers saying that bitcoin is terrible because they are just scared of the change it is bringing on.  People need to wake the fuck up and merchants need to start becoming more visionary.

So you do not see the issue with storing boxes of dangerous explosives in an apartment? Aside from it being illegal that is.
@_date: 2015-11-10 23:44:01
[Here is the court transcript - read it for yourself] (
He was selling, storing, and mailing explosives. Whether they were fireworks makes no difference at all.  If I took 10,000 M4's and put them in the apartment above you I doubt you would say "lol fireworks".  He was also in possession of "pipe bombs" that were not included in the charge.   He was selling these things to gun stores and juveniles.  
The judge described his behavior as anti-social and said that he felt the law did not apply to him.  The judge explained the entire situation very well.
So no, it was not a case of a pack of bottle rockets and statist law out of control.

This guy asked for advice and people here gave him some awesome feedback.  Not only did he ignore it all, he came back to remind everyone and suggested others use it for the same purpose. 
PR is one of bit-cions biggest issues and awful presentations like this will only scare people off or confuse them beyond hope.  No presentation, content and complexity aside, should ever feature walls of text.  It is the most basic fucking tenet of effective presentations.

@_date: 2019-05-10 01:51:08
You are right but I am asking a sincere question. If the requirement for a sidechain is settling on the blockchain, couldn't any other coin that can both buy bitcoin and be bought with bitcoin be considered a sidechain if it is marketed as such? I guess I am trying to understand where an altcoin ends and a sidechain begins.

@_date: 2019-05-24 16:46:18
lmao... What? Bitcoin only has a USD high value at the moment because people are speculating on it. You do remember how the front page here is splattered with USD value when whales pump it right? That is because without USD it is worthless.  The intrinsic value of it (which is based on what use case again?) is an order of magnitude lower, near zero.  Not sure how facebook is even remotely relevant beyond an awful attempt at a whataboutism.
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:36:58
I don't think anyone claimed you couldn't insert a middleman between a company and the consumer to pay with bitcoin.  AT&amp;T is "accepting" bitcoin as much as Amazon is... which is not directly without a third party so they don't have to touch the tokens.  If there has to be a middleman why not pay with credit cards and get some protections.  Paying with bitcoin would be a bigger deal if it was direct.

AA is incredible!! I don't get how the government could have refused him as an expert witness citing no credibility or actual expertise at Ross's trial.  I get it was a kangaroo court but even those have limits on their insanity.  Refusing AA as an expert because "forum posts do not establish credibility" is like arguing up is down.

It is a token that is bought with bitcoin, outside of the blockchain, and is listed on exchanges separately from bitcoin.  I guess it is ostensibly "pegged" to bitcoin but other than that what makes it not an altcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:48:58
There are no dividends and all value gained or lost from owning bitcoin depends solely on what the next person will pay (why they pay what they do is irrelevant).   It is important to realize that just because bitcoin tickers say a certain price does not mean that everyone can realize their stash at that price.  Paper gains mean nothing.
