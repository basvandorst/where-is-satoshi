Shouldn't have sold, i started buying at 3800usd and at different prices and when I sold I had 2x profit of total amounts invested, I panic sold because I had good profit and then saw it rising and I bought it immediately, I got little more coins than what I initially had though.
I feel like crap for panic selling

Yeah absolutely, how do we expect acceptance of cryptocurrency if these games are played.

Sorry a noob question, what is a Bitcoin node or full core node? What does it do for me? I have a Pi 3

Damn, yeah seeing it that way does make me happy. Such a taboo word gambling but I guess thats what it is
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:00:02
Thank you.

I am sorry to hear this, have you called them out on Twitter, Facebook?
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:38:08
Thank you. I am glad I bought at lower price than what it is now and using my initial investement I got little more coin share.
I should have just slept over it, it was in the midnight for me though.

Use changelly to do it, convert BCH to BTC and then transfer it to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:55:05
Oh fuck it's 9800

What happens when hash power doesnot come back up? Will btc die eventually? I have 0.44btc stuck in electrum to exchange now over two days and paid 12usd fee, is this because everyone is mining BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:36:24
I haven't gotten mine confirmed yet either, 2000usd with 12usd as fees. It will eventually

@_date: 2017-11-30 06:07:54
I will keep that in mind, thanks again :)

How would you know that?
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:52:55
How do you determine it's a fake wall?
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:59:00
What kind of reports are you reading now that it is at 4000, how do you decide if you have to buy it now?
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:53:58
How do you mean it will be affect me a LOT? Since its in paper wallet, you mean I don't get the benefit of alt coins too right? I still can't wrap my head around the whole thing, sorry new to bitcoins and the whole fork thing is confusing
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:02:39
I bought bitcoins in India through Zebpay app and it is in there wallet, what happens during hard fork?
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:08:58
Thank you, so if I have them in paper wallet, Hard fork doesnt affect my btc?
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:16:34
Hi would you ship internationally? India. You could send it through post too. I have had a few phones that way from US.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:24:53
Look into electrum too
@_date: 2018-07-27 03:02:37
Yeah closed my credit card, closed my other card on which I didn't trade. Used it to buy on cex.io way back in Last year June and they closed it this year march.
What happened to the money in your savings account? Was it credit or savings?
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:21:19
Nothing sketchy, try it with a low transaction of 50USD and experience it yourself
