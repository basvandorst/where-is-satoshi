That's the thing with China. They have lost all credibility by not taking the lead.  While other countries are taking advantage of the Bitcoin architecture, they wait patiently until they're ready to make a black-market copy. They have a record of doing these kind of things by not being innovative.

I believe the IRS is wrong in their decision-making. They should understand that the majority of people  who used this form of currency believe it is a virtual currency. The differences is you can purchase goods, services and also can pay your bills if more companies are willing to accept it. Gold and silver is property, but you cannot purchase anything with it until it is exchanged.

I just sent my requests to Amazon.  I'm going to  tell all my friends and  acquaintances  who  are invested in bitcoins to send a request to Amazon. Spread the word everybody and pass on this link.

I just stumbled upon this  website that offer free Bitcoins every day. I just want to share this with the rest of the bitcoin  community. Tell me what you think  about it.
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:16:53
Thanks have you tried them out yet and verify if they are a scam. I want to know more from others and their experience because I have received some bitcoins and transferred it to my wallet for the couple of days being with them. I don't mind testing out the waters to curb my curiosity. If I see any problems I will let the Bitcoin community know.
If I see any unauthorized junk mail in my junk email account I will also keep you posted. I have read their no-spam policy I will make sure if they keep their word.

I can't be the only one to tell them. You need a huge community of people  to come together to make them finally realize how wrong they are.

BFL has a record of late shipping. I don't know if I trust BFL as a company. But then again, I already got the watch, and I'm loving it already. I don't mind getting the BFL wallet, as long they have to product at hand.

I don't completely understand your comment. But from what I can understand so for is that I don't consider myself a slave to the government. It looks like they are imposing, enforcing their laws and regulations on us. What can we do, but to abide and follow the law.

I am truly sorry for what happened. Ignorance is bliss when all you hear is negative information from the news media. Your teacher and principal are all NOOB to this type of information.  They all need to be recondition and educated towards the information of cryptocurrency. They shouldn't have jumped towards conclusions not realizing there is change  growing all around them. No matter what you do there will always be people out there doing illegal activities.  Where most of us are just trying to invest and do things legal.  You are the future, so continue to  guide and educate them for what they don't understand. We are standing behind you 100%,  and they need to send you an apology letter. if they don't, use every legal action to get back at them. Don't make them ruin your good name.
P.S people buy drugs with real money.  and people will always find imaginary ways  to find loopholes in the system.

So what's the best reply, then?

Apple is too nervous to support  Bitcoin. They shouldn't have taken away all the  crypto-currency Apps off the App store due to the negativity surrounding it. I don't care if they start putting their trusts back in Bitcoin again.  They shouldn't have jumped and judged by listening to the negative media. I will not be going back stick with android. They believe in the fate innovation.

I need to see your source code before I trust you guys. installing this extension is a high risk for me, since I'm using a third-party company to buy products on the web. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:37:29
I can totally agree on that. I will always keep an eye out on what I get out from them. If they are not promising I will let everyone know. From what I see from my experience they are not intrusive and you do see the balance of cryptocurrencies gradually go up for my test today.
@_date: 2014-05-10 03:39:09
They just want to know your financial activities is all about.  When you call just given the correct answers that they want to hear if you are using crypto currency for investments.  A lot of banks have a Lot of mistrusts with online exchanges because they think that they pose a threat to money laundering. They don't want to be held responsible under government regulations.

Thanks for the info and the link that you've sent me.  I am going out right now to purchase one with the camera.  As you said you can hack it to add Mycelium, which definitely consider my decision to purchase it.

I'm looking into purchasing the Samsung gear 2. I want to use it as a digital wallet, but I will like to have the opinions of others before I make the jump.

Does this has something do with the coup d'etat or martial law over there.

Just buy some bitcoin and not sell them in the exchanges. We need more confidence and more awareness.

I just hope it doesn't come up that crypto-currency is evil in the eyes of his school. That his ignorant teachers find a way to suspend him from school  due to negative media remarks.  Your son is doing a good thing to pass on and educate the ones who have no knowledge what  crypto-currency is.

go and find a Bitcoin ATM and avoid the banks
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:02:32
Do it when you are ready. Don't be lazy, get out of your house, find that ATM, put your money in it and transfer it to a wallet or exchange that you trust. Why are you worried about high fees. Its a Bitcoin ATM buddy where you avoid the banking rhetoric. The Bitcoin ATM is still in its young infrastructure stage. So give it the support it needs.

Go Mycelium or Blockchain wallet
@_date: 2014-05-17 19:45:41
The battery isn't a problem for me, as long a gets the job done and last the whole day. If something else comes out that's better than the Samsung gear 2, I will drop this in a heartbeat and purchase something else.

Ask in large quantities, and you shall receive. It's not about begging top corporations.  It's about getting their cooperation to accept and recognize a growing trend of a new currency. The less noise, the less acceptance.

My friends and family who are investors in Fiat thought I was stupid enough to invest in digital because they lack the knowledge back in 2011. No matter how much I told them that this is going to be big, they would just give me the snare. Even with the ups and downs and the negative media attention of Mt Gox. They will try to give me the ha ha,  I told you so moment. I will be backing Bitcoin because I understand the ecosystem behind it. Now it takes their friends and family to convince them and now they look at me with aw. To the moon Suckers.

Forget Apple. As soon they have gotten rid of most of the crypto-currency apps on their APP store. That is when I realize they were dictating my apps of choice. I will not trust Apple for that. Screw them and go with Android because them believe in innovation and less controlled decisions. I don't care how great the phone is. Just stick with android.

There is no special treatment in the tax code because this is a new form of technology and it  need to be implemented in the tax code to be recognized. The tax regulations is always changing every year so why can't they just add it.  You also stated that businesses like pawn shops except  precious metals for trade. That is exactly what I meant by exchange.  can you go to a  e-commerce website,  car dealership, grocery store or more and purchase something with gold and silver without an exchange or trade. I guess not. With bitcoin you can, once it's become more popular.
