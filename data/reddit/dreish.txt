That's an interesting idea, but I would expect that as long as there is any interest in the system, there will always be some who mine, even if only as a hobby that loses a little money.

If I could try to tease out a more precise claim, since strictly speaking there *are* already a few merchants selling things for BitCoins (I swear, if I hear about alpaca socks one more time ...), it sounds to me as though you believe the day will never come that an ordinary suburban soccer mom without a relevant political ax to grind would consider using BitCoins to buy things online as a co-equal alternative to, say, Visa.
You may be right about that. I don't know. Right now they're a little cumbersome. I imagine BitCoins being used in the nearer term by people who want to play online poker, but that could go away if recent moves toward legalizing online poker reach fruition, which I suppose might leave just speculators, people who want to donate to WikiLeaks, and a few libertarian cranks buying socks from each other.
It seems like an interesting new thing to me, though. There's nothing else quite like it. To me, that sounds like a recipe for unexpected new uses.

That's painful, but they could have just as easily spent the same money on a pizza. Would that have been any more painful?
You can look through the derivatives market listings in the WSJ any weekday of the year and find something that shot up in value more than BitCoin on its best day. Why isn't it painful that you didn't load up on *those?* It's not reasonable to expect one's self to have known what was going to happen over the following few months.
**Edit**: Actually read the thing. He doesn't say when he bought, but it does seem to imply he sank a lot of money into it. But yes, it does sound like he shot himself in the foot entirely by himself. It wasn't, as the OP misleadingly implies, a fault of the client.

Why? The supply curve has more to do with the decisions of people who hold the 6.3 million BitCoins already in circulation than with the decisions of people who are mining around 12,000 new ones a day.

Fine with me. Glad you're not hurt by the little minus signs. If you want to edit without being shady, the usual thing to do is just to append:
**Edit:** Nevermind, I was totally wrong.

There are only about $850 billion in US dollars in circulation. If they were all replaced with BitCoins and if the resulting BitCoins had the same total value ($40,000 per BitCoin), that would mean the smallest unit of currency would be worth $0.0004, or 1/25 of a cent.

And as has been said elsewhere, the 8 decimal thing isn't a permanent hard limit; I suspect it's just there to keep things practical for programmers.

You implied that MtGox would probably run out of cash if there were panic selling. Everyone has been taking turns patiently trying to explain to you why this is incorrect. *Please* just admit you were talking out of your ass and move on.
@_date: 2011-05-17 22:19:31
Got it from googling "US currency in circulation". I believe that's the most appropriate figure to use as a high-end value for what the sum total of BitCoins might some day be worth, though that still leaves the issue of lost coins. And the entire discussion is moot anyway, as you point out.
@_date: 2011-06-15 18:23:24
The issue is potentially more significant than just the amount of storage needed for the block chain. The statistic I read (I can't remember where, nor the exact numbers, sorry) was that if BitCoin had the same transaction volume as Visa, the network traffic would exceed that of even a fairly fast home broadband connection, so even a check-and-prune strategy wouldn't work.
The text I was reading suggested that before this point, BitCoin would move to a two-tiered structure, where relatively few full clients run, and lightweight second-tier clients connect to them (and would of course have to trust them).

Use of BitCoin, or cash for that matter, is not tax evasion. Failing to report income is tax evasion, as are other things. The fact that some number of people are excited about BitCoin because they think it somehow will allow them to evade taxes (hint: if you're reporting $5,000 a year in income and living a middle-class lifestyle, you're going to have a hard time getting through an audit) doesn't change that.

Not so much, no. The definition of "poor" is someone who doesn't have money -- typically the poor have a negative net worth, having to borrow against next week's paycheck just to meet overdue expenses. It is their debts that increase when denominated in a deflationary currency.
I find BitCoin interesting, though, and I suspect it may be just subversive enough not to ever become the standard denomination for debts.
@_date: 2011-05-18 14:45:23
Agree if we're talking about rational actors. But that's another thing about the poor: they make shitty decisions. Try visiting a check-cashing business for some real-world examples.

You neither edited the original post to acknowledge the error, nor acknowledged it in the immediate followup. That's really frustrating to read. That's why everyone is methodically downvoting all your comments.
And please don't take this the wrong way, but your "Sorry you missed the transition" is the sort of thing that, in person, gets people broken jaws. It would really help you gain influence if you could learn to be a bit bigger and admit mistakes. People look up to that sort of thing.

You didn't RTFA, did you? If you're short on time, I think this excerpt sums it up nicely:


Sounds prudent to me.

Their solution, to pass the coins along to the Bitcoin Faucet, is a nice one.

I agree with everything you wrote except "You are missing the point."
*My* point is that the blog implies that the client had a *bug* that caused people who were doing things correctly to lose money -- this was how I understood it after reading the blog, before reading the forum posts -- and that this is not true.
"Technical issues in how the client generated keys has led to users losing Bitcoins even when they tried to backup properly." *I believe this is true but misleading.*
"The BitCoin client is clunky and doesn't do enough to help users back up the wallet correctly, which leads to loss of money by users who are not sufficiently careful, even if they are technically adept." *This is how I would phrase it, and I suspect we would both agree on this statement.*

And, repeating coffeetablesex's point, the difficulty can be lowered almost arbitrarily until mining again becomes appealing. It need not always pay off the equivalent of 2011US$350. The combination of lowered difficulty and increased (though not necessarily extremely high) transaction fees ought to be enough to keep it going indefinitely.

Needs to lose the forced account creation. That's a rookie mistake.

BitCoins derive value in any given moment from being uniquely useful, in that they are authenticated, do not rely on trust in any single organization, can be transported across the Internet freely, and have been for some time now accepted in exchange for other things of value. That's all it really needs to have intrinsic value clearer than that of precious metals.
The volatility can be easily dealt with by quoting prices in some more stable currency and saying, "payment also accepted in BitCoins at the current exchange rate."
There probably will be a bubble and a crash, but for people who want to actually use it for its intended purpose, they need not hold more than a few dollars worth at a time, so your claim that using it entails some insurmountable risk makes no sense.
Also, I would point out that the Weimar Republic (note spelling) suffered from hyperinflation because there was no limit on the number of marks they could print, and they printed as many as they could in a vain attempt to trade their currency for foreign currencies and gold to pay off their WWI reparations. On the major points in that sentence, BitCoin's fundamental differences are to its advantage: its quantities are limited, and it is not controlled by a government that might have a reason to ruin it.

Sure, Mt Gox is amateur hour (what would you expect under the circumstances, really?), but a little less hysterics and nonsense conspiracy theories from all would be helpful. The last thing we need is more bullshit piled on top of the bullshit that the situation already consists of.
@_date: 2011-06-07 20:56:14
That's true but not really relevant to what happened here. The OP is implying the client did something that caused the money to disappear, when I would describe this case as the user making assumptions about the internal workings that turned out to be tragically untrue. The basic facts are:
1. The user had a wallet file containing a large number of BitCoins.
2. The user securely deleted that file *without* keeping an encrypted copy, mistakenly thinking the money also existed in an earlier version of the wallet file that turned out not to have it anymore.
The bottom line is: don't delete wallet files ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever. Replace with encrypted versions and tuck away in a subdirectory if you must, but don't ever delete irrevocably.

Fair enough. "This bodes ill" is a little ambiguous, so I must have guessed wrong at what you meant.
I suspect you're right -- only the brave, the foolish, or the stubbornly principled will likely be early adopters. The bar for all three lowers gradually as more people adopt, if they do, or as the law becomes more clear. I don't see how that bodes ill, though. That's just how new things work.
It would be bad if the law settled on the position that BitCoin is illegal to use, but that hasn't happened yet. That has been a known uncertainty around BitCoin for a while now.
