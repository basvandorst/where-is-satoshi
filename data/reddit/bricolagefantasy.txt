The obstacle IS NOT volatility. (I mean if most of bitcoin useful transaction is buying pizza/lunch/go to bar. Spending extra $1-2 on $5-10 bill due to fluctuation wouldn't bother most people.)
too bad if you are currency speculator , or if you are trying to buy a Ferrari. 
The biggest bitcoin obstacle is convincing merchants to start using bitcoin for all those lovely little transaction .... 
Here is my suggestion:  suggest to merchant to also becoming a bitcoin seller for cash locally. (so if they are a popular pub, accumulating a lot of bitcoin, instead of going to exchanger, start selling those bitcoin back to local area/your own customer. don't accumulate all of them. (I mean how much profit do you need? 2-3% profit  is plenty. on top of bitcoin for safekeeping.)
so basically, bitcoin community task is to go beyond "introducing bitcoin" but also teach merchant how to accept and sell bitcoin locally. (say: beyond 2-3 bitcoin, try to sell 70-80% of accumulated bitcoin right back in local area. Spread it around. small local circulation is now what is important.)
general public/average joe is having difficulty buying bitcoin in small quantity.
we already take care of corrupt politicians and banksters. they are not a threat anymore. In fact they are now the primary actor of pumper (and dumper) Their greed is just too powerful.

Bitcoin needs a "mapping" apps that says where/which business and location accept bitcoin.

He senses that bitcoin is important, but he doesn't understand exactly why. He knows that bitcoin does not fit with his economic theory.  But in order to do that he has to admit that the entire economic theory is a giant BS. (ie. the problem of trust in fiat, and the lesser problem or monetary and fiscal policy. The whole thing now has been reduced to accounting fraud and currency inflation. Basically cheating on everybody.   Bitcoin simply done away with the nonsense of "backed by gun and sound policy" and formalized the entire money printing and transaction into giant unified system.)

they can always announce something illegal. If bitcoin is a "currency" then legally there are a lot of ways to say a competing currency is illegal.
so the beauty of all this, bitcoin is a little confusing. It is simply a crypto ledger that is being used for transaction. It can function like currency.
But noone is controlling the ledger. so that bit confuses the hell out of them.

they have to control network calculation capacity. At current size, it's about 45TH/s for an entity to have 50% control. or about 7 of no.1 supercomputer in the world. That's still bigger than all computers in china combined.
I suppose china can spend real money and developing super computer class asic build 3 or 4 of them with latest fabrications, then they will probably control the entire network easily.

I for one takes safety on bitcoin keep being laugh at in mainstream media. a)It's free advertisement. b)no serious government agencies will take action on TV joke.
The minute bitcoin becomes serious, they gonna start regulating, banning, tax, bludgeon to death, etc.
I think all effort should be made into wider merchant and transaction volume instead of mainstream media PR.

would you rather BTC be recognized as currency and won flooding in and blow up BTC price to stratosphere then crashed?
it is not being banned, just like china's statement. It''s just a digital goods. Trade at your own risk.
@_date: 2013-05-04 03:28:37
the problem is still converting to fiat. Reality  dictates that most goods and service will in the end still need fiat. And fiat/dollar trade is highly regulated.

It was a big pump and dump event. no big deal. The big pint from all that, a huge exposure and a lot of money going into the system, everything increase dramatically.  No doubt there will be more such effort in the future.
oh, and I was voted down to oblivion in r/economics when I say volatility range will decrease in percentage as price increases.  (I mean I thought this is a common sense, since the amount of pump and dump speculation is not infinitely large, and size of bitcoin activity will become larger..) but whatever.
@_date: 2013-05-07 03:38:15

@_date: 2013-05-07 16:08:56
well it's a guesstimate, but enough to get the big picture.
the top 10 in 500 computers represent about half of total world computing power.
you can also estimate how many intel chip being sold each year. about 300millions of various models and sizes, china only very recently reaches about 70million units sold. (about a third or so of global PC sales)
so being generous, china probably represent 20% of world computing power. about 3 or so no.1 computer.
well this is not counting smartphones and stuff, just guesstimating from PC/intel cpu. No asic and specialized chip either. but the point, you can see the magnitude required.
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:04:53
they are trying to undermine the entire exchange ecosystem to bring down the bitcoin.  This is also why no US bank wants to transfer money to Mt.Gox.

@_date: 2013-12-18 02:10:25

Bitcoin is only useful if people use it. Circulation is the ultimate value, not exchange price to dollar or what not. (dollar is being debased to death at the moment btw.)
IMO, a little bit coin price fluctuation is a good thing, it will help people buy and sell instead of hoarding.

probably somebody should start 'strickly bitcoin for future agriculture and produce'  I bet tons of people in san francisco will buy tomato/potato/etc at guarantee BTC price.
they gonna have hard time deciding this type of trade since all involved are floating about and price is highly uncertain. What is the price of BTC in potato/tomato 6 months from now? LOL...
and to make it even more complicated, they should set up the exchange somewhere in ukraine. while the actual produce/buyers are in San francisco.

the way I see it, it's narrower problem. It's btc-fiat panic/run.  This will keep happening until bitcoin use and volume is large enough that few idiots attacking exchange won't matter to price.
 why not this. Why not create a Bank/exchange hybrid. This will provide capital for bitcoin bank in actual currency, while maintaining good conversion.
- If I open a bank account. I need a) cash/dollar b) bitcoin in near 1:1 ratio.  Account size will be limited initially. each account only $1000. + equivalent BTC. As an account grow older, the bank will have enough transaction data, and can change the limit (either up the BTC or dollar store) safely.
So essentially, an individual account is also providing its own BTC fiat backing/ liquidity.)
As long as the bank is discipline, running the exchange very carefully not to go far beyond its fiat backing capital. It can maintain huge stability. things will grow very quickly.
Even if every account holder bail out and cash out their BTC, the bank still have something. (fiat currency + income from normal banking operation). as bank size grow, 1:1 ratio can be slowly changed.  Most people only use BTC in the range of thousands anyway. It's so early in the game. People want stability of their holding. extra income goes into upping members BTC selling limit.
- only member can buy sell btc in the exchange. (but membership set up is so easy, I wouldn't worry about not having customers)
- a person can only  sell proportional to his holding/account (will increase as his trade pattern is known.) One can buy BTC as much as he wants. most people simply want practical security, not crazy daytrader.  
- since the bank actually also hold dollar/normal currency, this bank can keep enlarging fiat backing capital by normal banking investment activities, thus providing liquidity  for BTC daily trade fluctuation.
- crazies need not apply (read: HFT computers)
as time progresses, the fiat($) vs. BTC tied up requirement for each account will weaken. probably after a decade or so, after BTC use become widespread, the bank can run purely on BTC.
Basically, a BTC bank will be set up like the way before paper money. Gold + promise note. except the gold is crappy/ever debased fiat money.
Since it is bank-exchange hybrid, it can control the price of BTC-fiat price in case of run/panic.  being able convert about $5-10K worth of BTC to dollar in case of emergency probably will cover nearly every regular joe. I don't care losing 5-8% fiat in case of emergency, but 30-50% price fluctuation in mere few days is not workable in real world period. I also don't care much about earning high interest on the cash part since it's small cash. But the exchange security of my BTC holding to fiat should be predictable and maintained.
This will be a boon for small merchants who doesn't need large cash exchange, but small periodic fiat to pay for stuff. One can stay as long as possible in BTC.
Come to think of it. if somebody figure out the math behind it. this will be the most profitable/easy money making venture in banking history. mmmm...
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:09:15
Big banks are at war with bitcoin because their creditcard and small transaction business will be decimated. Do not believe anythng they say, they will trick you and confiscate money later.  Always disguise your even remotely related transaction to bitcoin.
They are trying very hard to snuff bitcoin.
