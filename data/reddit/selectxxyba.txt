Use taxes from the sale of any automotive related transaction (insurance, registration, petrol, tyres, parts, maintenance).
Consumption based tax means that the supply of money grows proportionately with a rise in need.
To get the funds to the road builders you could rely on a tender based system.

It's a custom live orderbook for bitstamp that I built. I'm in the process of setting up a VPS to host it on because the el cheapo host I have now won't handle more than 5 connections at a time without the site falling to bits.

Inflation erodes a money's purchasing power. By doubling the supply of money, holders of the original supply have a reduced purchasing power.
So in the example, after the money supply was doubled it will cost me twice as much to buy the same amount of bitcoin prior to the increase in money supply.
But against that supply I could now sell my bitcoin for $20, the purchasing power of bitcoin remains constant.

The irony is that when bitcoin first came out it was both easier and more simple to use than it is now. Tech is meant to get better with time, somehow bitcoin got worse.

This is a poor mentality that helps people cope with real losses.
You can't buy as much for your btc today as you could a week ago, even without selling you've lost purchasing power which is a real loss.

What are the advantages to an annual net worth tax compared to a consumption tax at the point of transaction?
@_date: 2014-04-29 19:09:11
Strongly disagree. Only speculators buy in on a rising price with the intention of dumping later on for proffits. What we want to do is create genuine demand for bitcoin. And at the moment the biggest obstacle to bringing new money into bitcoin is the barrier of entry and level of technical knowledge required.
If bitcoin is truly for the other 6 billion, it needs to be made accessible to them without the need to download the block-chain, setup an exchange account, wire money to an exchange, setup offline storage, etc.
If we can break down these barriers of entry then new money flows into the bitcoin ecosystem and drives the price higher.
@_date: 2014-03-14 13:02:20
So how are they going to collect it? I can't see them accepting tax in bitcoin and they can't force anyone to cash out.

Miners would be assigned an internal ip address like computers on a LAN network which would preserve their real world identity but allow for the identification of all entity's submitting hashes. To combat pool hopping set a rule in place that hashes are only accepted after the same entity has been submitting for at least 2 blocks and with the original rule in place even if you had 99% hashing power you still couldn't chain together blocks as you please.

Once 21 million have been mined the miners will rely on transaction fees to remain profitable.
21 million hard limit is due to the block reward and 4 year halving, started at 50 bitcoins per block every 10 minutes --&gt; 25 --&gt; 12.5 --&gt; 6.25, etc.

SCRYPT would only be a temporary fix. Wouldn't take long before ASIC's designed for that would come along as well and then we're back to square one.
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:34:04
Yes it does because it's a deflationary currency with a hard limit. The way fractional reserve banking works is banks only ever need to hold 10% in reserve against the deposits that they take.
So if someone deposits $100, the bank can leave $10 in their vault and loan out the remaining $90.
To keep it simple, say that this is the only bank that people use, that $90 is loaned out to people who then spend it, the other people who receive that money then deposit it back into the same bank. Now the bank is showing another $90 in deposits of which they can lend out $81 because they only need to keep $9 in reserve of that $90. This process repeats itself until the original $100 has created almost 10x it's amount in loans. The real issue is if all of the depositors wished to withdraw their money, they couldn't, because the bank only has 10% of their deposits.
Sounds like a scam, but it gets worse, the bank charges interest on it's loans for money it never had, and that is what Henry Ford was talking about.

Another middleman trying to take his cut. Is there any reason you didn't bother to register a .com.au?
@_date: 2013-08-31 16:00:49
I'd say it's inevitable for several reasons.
1) Mining has moved from GPU clusters to ASIC dedicated miners which are much more efficient. This means the miners don't have to sell their coins to cover upkeep costs and make a profit which has 2 side effects. The first is that the supply of bitcoins available for purchase is drying up and the second is that those without ASIC's have no choice but to buy them.
2) We've been in a strong upwards rally since the price bottomed out at 65 and people's investing confidence has increased.
3) Have you seen all the good news recently? Good news means media attention and media attention brings in more buyers pushing the price up further.
4) And most importantly the strong organic growth of the bitcoin ecosystem is thriving. Venture capital is flowing into businesses that are building bitcoin based services which further increases demand.
I'd say hold onto your hats because we're in for an exciting ride this time.
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:25:48
Miners on the other hand are motivated by profit and are fallible. And with asics taking over from gpu miners, the hashing power is becoming less decentralized. A gentleman's agreement / constitution would certainly be beneficial but it's still too early to tell which direction things will head in.

The document wouldn't be there to limit what the protocol can and can't do but rather to ensure that certain freedoms and liberties that already exist are never compromised at a protocol or client level.

@_date: 2013-11-14 13:06:14
Absolutely nothing as that wouldn't be the purpose of this consitution. If however you were able to convince The Bitcoin Foundation to roll out a newer version of the protocol that exports both IP addresses of a transaction to a government database then that would go against one of the core principals, psuedo anonymity, of the hypothetical constitution. The miners would then be able to easily determine if they should or should not include transactions from specific client types based on the constitution that they helped to write.

Do they have daily deposit or withdrawal limits?

Users need to take responsibility for their own security. I'm sure the advent of hardware wallets like the trezor will greatly assist in this and in the future banks will offer their services to hold and protect your BTC in cold storage.
We shouldn't have to give up one ounce of liberty for any security.

Please tell me you have them stored in a completely offline wallet, something like armoury watching only wallet in an external hdd with ubuntu on it. Make sure you keep this backed up at more than one location as well. Safety deposit box at a bank would be a good idea.

Transaction fees are an incentive for miners to include your transaction into a block. You don't have to include a transaction fee but the risk you take from that is a longer time before you get a confirmation.
This is because miners that include your transaction in a block and solve that block get to keep the transaction fees.
At the moment the transaction fee has a set minimum within the main bitcoin client but you can use other clients which have lower fees built into them.
