Bitcoin is not anonymous at all in this case (and most cases). Coinbase holds the keys to your bitcoin wallet and they know who you are.
But it sounds like this isn’t a bitcoin transaction at all. You sold the bitcoin, right? So they’re trying to transfer cash to an inactive PP account. I think you should be fine. If it already failed once, it will probably fail every time they retry, so just contact Coinbase and tell them to stop.

The wallet gave me this address in the first place.
In any case, it's solved now. Thanks.

Question: How does Coinbase know that a link you are sending Bitcoin to/from is illegal? Aren't the links unique?

Thank you.

Thank you for the reassurance. I can wait that long.

Oh this is very interesting. I'll have to look into it.
It's not the mempool state lookup that I mind. I just don't want to accidentally fat finger a $100 fee :) I do like this alternative idea of selecting from a list of fee options.

Thanks. I understand that now. It doesn't help my current situation though, does it?
Here's the thing though. I use BRD specifically for it's simplicity. I conduct many Bitcoin txns per day, out of necessity, for my business. The last thing I want to do is introduce a new point of possible human error. No matter how careful I am, I WILL make a decimal point mistake eventually and lose money by sending way too much in fees. I'd rather have a wallet that intelligently sets the fees for me. Is there another wallet you can recommend that is better at doing this?

Yes, if your wallet supports it. From my OP:

Yes, Thursday evening.
