I just noticed last time that Wiki article was updated "This page was last modified on 26 May 2013" and i only see BTC/SLL on the Exchange and not SSL/BTC if that matters?

Im fairly new to understanding all this Crypto Currency. Ive been doing a lot of research and what i can take from this is to not buy Bitcoins right now and wait for the crash. Should i start investing in TerraCoins, PPCoins, and LiteCoins right now? Can someone help me out? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:06:27
Fuck, only $100?... Ive been helplessly watching Bitcoin drop then now shoot back up to Average of $680 hopefully it drops some more so i can deposit over the next couple days to afford one. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:50:30
What about MultiBit? 
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:28:21
Awesome thank you! 
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:35:55
How have you found Coinsetter so far? Do they have any AltCoins such as LTC? 
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:03:43
Interesting, in my eyes Litecoins and Bitcoins could be like Silver and Gold. But im very new at this. What do you make of people saying Bitcoins could rise to $1000 or even $100,000. It all sounds a bit extreme to me. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:27:09
Does this work well in the USA? Could i please have an invite 
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:35:01
Totally agree plus it would raise the price significantly, ive just recently started getting into bitcoin. Any chance you could help me test out my wallet jrat? :P 
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:52:20
Perfect Thanks 
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:09:24
Did you send a money order? 
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:21:44
Its very depressing that coinbase is the only closest equivalent.. :/ 
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:28:45
How much does it cost to buy one? Is there a percentage the owners of the box take? 
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:42:02
What about GoldCoin? Looks like an interesting investment 
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:47:09
Is it possible that it might drop back to $140 or less like before?  Hopefully not.. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:59:01
So would Zercoin be a good investment on an exchange? 
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:20:20
to add on, my first thoughts when reading these posts were: 
Then again look at Warren Buffet's age. Its safe to assume that probably not even he can perfectly grasp the change in currency that Bitcoin could possibly have due to the technological age we live in that is advancing extremely quickly. Nobody knows where bitcoin will go or how much it will be but the next wave of people can sure get "rich quick" off of it if it keeps on being slowly adopted around the world. Just enjoy the ride. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:35:54
Thank you! 
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:03:50
My question is: What do you think of this in Interesting Read.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:21:12
If only i could figure out how to buy Bitcoins online in the USA... everywhere i search coinbase if having problem, bitstamp is having problems, and ebay prices are double of 1 BTC in USD.
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:55:57
Elaborate a little bit more, what did you have him do to set it up? How long did it take, was the person from USA? etc 
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:23:35
No... I don't think you can straight up post a job on a freelancing site you want to buy Bitcoin or whatever currency exchange lol. So you post a job wanting some simple task AND Bitcoins to "mask" only wanting bitcoins and possibly not violating terms of service. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:31:43
Damn! Thanks for doing that though, maybe theres a site out there for freelancing with minimal fees. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:54:51
Tungsten is also a good metal to invest in 
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:00:24
Do you have to be verified on Coinbase? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:33:42
Looks like the crash stabilized itself out and we are back at around $500 and $600 on Gox 
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:52:21
Just what i need to hear! Thanks for posting on here. If you're looking for a big deposit how bad are the fees for say $100+ ? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:17:26
Too many fees, but if youre desperate its a smooth process. Other than that, send a money order. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:41:39
Do you guys privately buy Bitcoin from people looking to sell? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:02:22
No Prob dude, id do the exact same thing. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:37:08
;) 
@_date: 2013-10-30 23:21:29
Im fairly new to understanding all this Crypto Currency. Ive been doing a lot of research Should i start investing in TerraCoins, PPCoins, and LiteCoins right now? Or should i invest in a couple bitcoins? What do you make of people saying Bitcoins could rise to $1000 or even $100,000. It all sounds a bit extreme to me..
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:17:30
How secure is linking your bank account? Im very weary of doing something like that, even on a well known site such as Paypal. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:42:21
Your red shiny car just convinced me to buy a couple BTC, haha. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:37:03
So what happened OP? Did you receive your bitcoins after a while? Ive been thinking of buying BTC through paypal, but making the seller send 3/4 of my order first. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 00:26:26
Was it worth 10,000 bitcoins?    :) 
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:46:12
Brah, Beeg on one screen and BitcoinWisdom on the other
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:48:33
Whos the creator of this website and how can i contact him? This website theme is exactly what i want to use for a site (not related to bitcoins) 
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:16:57
Thats Alex Ovechkin's Mercedes. Damn!! 
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:47:31
Awesome!!! 
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:41:40
Yeah except litecoin has just been stuck at 3.80 - 4.10 the past couple weeks. What might cause it to shoot up? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:44:17
Pretty cool, but at the same time. Its pretty funny since the couple need to fund their marriage somehow, and this is how they did it. Creative, props. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:58:13
How safe is it if you encrypt a Multibit wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:48:07
Wonder if Jay-Z has already invested in Bitcoins. I know i heard in an interview that hes investing in Yen, so hes forward thinking. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:28:43
Is there any ATMs in the states like this? One in NYC would be a gold mine 
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:12:48
That actually made me laugh a bit. For some reason i imagined Will Ferrell saying that someone. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:09:13
So whats the most logical prediction? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:16:10
So what exact percentage does someone pay if they make under $37k a year from their job? Only 15% and nothing else??? 
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:36:35
Lol. I knew something looked wrong in my post, meant to say Yuan. Yes, at this point in his career JayZ can afford to play around with huge sums of bitcoins.  Which would be awesome if he endorsed it 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:51:20
Is there a tutorial on that? What are the fees for Ripple - BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:07:01
Does Kraken take money orders?
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:05:08
 Very Cool, glad there is a soon alternative to CampBX. Wonder how theyll do with support and site functionality when their site begins to have more traffic. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:24:51
Ill buy Bitcoin on Ebay from you if you sell it at a decent price, like 5% higher than BTC-E. The problem is that every seller is getting scammed because they sell for like $200 more than the average price. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:32:48
Thanks for the response! What about the statements of BTC rising to $1,000
