Thanks to difficulty adjustments, mining will likely always be profitable for *someone*. Those someones will be entities that can operate with the lowest overhead costs.  All of the unprofitable miners drop out, which not only makes the hash rate decrease and difficulty drop, but also in turn increases the market share of surviving miners. This consolidation of mining is a big win for surviving mining operations as it can turn slightly unprofitable mining to profitable, or otherwise increase profits and secure their position as a strong mining operation.
Right now the mining reward, not fees, is by far the incentive for mining. This is by design. From a free market perspective, this is probably the best way to bootstrap bitcoin and distribute coins. 
There are tons of market forces at play. It's an interesting thing to watch players in this ecosystem evolve and adapt. Never a dull moment.

I don't have an Android device either. Can't afford to upgrade.

Bitcoin is a cult? LOL.
Are all the people who recognize the genius of Charles Darwin and believe in the theory of evolution cultists as well?

Thank you so much, but I cannot accept this.

I should say CPU mining I guess. All I know is my computer wasn't cut out for it.

I downloaded the bitcoin client in 2010 just to see what all the fuss was about. Even back then it seemed like it took a good half hour or so to sync. I didn't understand what this whole syncing process was, though. I clicked on the mining button and hoped I was mining some coins. At first I thought the sync progress was my mining progress. After about an hour of mining and getting zero coins, I got frustrated, said "this is dumb" and promptly uninstalled the bitcoin software.
So if OP's friend is anything like me, the answer is no. Bitcoin was difficult to acquire back then (at least in any meaningful amount). Solo mining wasn't really feasible. No one you could physically exchange cash with had bitcoin. You basically had to hang around the bitcoin communities and hope to get some out of a faucet or beg for some or sell something to someone and hope neither person was scamming the other. The only BTC exchange was based in Japan and you had to wire money to them. Sounded pretty sketchy. Turned out it was.

I think it's time we all come to accept the fact that using the Bitcoin blockchain directly for microtransactions is and will always be impractical and unfeasible.
That said, I believe Bitcoin can still manage to help enable microtransactions with technologies that are built on top of the blockchain. So rather than have 1000 individual $0.01 transactions they could somehow be aggregated using an offchain service and settled/distributed as one $10 transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain once every 30 days or when you reach some threshold.

True. Which is why it's illegal to purposefully burn, deface, or destroy U.S. money. However hodlers of bitcoin welcome others to burn their bitcoins!

That doesn't negate the fact that Coinbase offers a poor customer experience. First impressions are important. This is where Coinbase has been dropping the ball big time.

Satoshi is not an infallible being. His words are not gospel. There is no sacred meaning in what he said.
If at any time he ever felt there was a need to destroy his keys, then he probably did. However there's no proof either way. But that doesn't mean we should use one of his quotes as absolute proof. Bitcoin's not a religion and Satoshi's words are not gospel.

The law is symbolic? LOL okay. Try operating a business where you melt down pennies and sell the copper and get back to me about how "symbolic" the law is.

Not necessarily. If you do a factory reset but don't use the computer much or at all after doing so, there is the chance a data recovery service could recover the wallet.

Keep in mind it'll be over 100 years before the last block reward is mined and the system becomes entirely fee-only.

It's awesome that you're playing around with bitcoin like any newbie should, but I'm going to tell you right now that's a horribly insecure way to store your bitcoins, and if you care at all about your money you should move those bitcoins to a more secure wallet.
First order of business is Brainwallets. The problem with Brainwallets is you must provide the random entropy yourself if you want a secure wallet. And humans are notoriously bad at coming up with truly random data. There are computers running 24/7 that work to crack Brainwallets with poor randomness. As computers get more powerful and bitcoin becomes more valuable, the issues with Brainwallets only gets worse. Those numbers you tagged on the end ought to be generated by rolling dice, and the more rolls the better. I'd do at least 60 dice rolls (60 digits). You only have 5 digits!
The second issue you have is physical loss. As goes with a paper wallet, what should happen if you lose your paper Brainwallets from theft, flood, or fire? If you only have one copy, then it's very vulnerable to loss. But at the same time if you have multiple copies of your paper Brainwallets, it's easier for an extra copy to find itself into the wrong person's hands. Fortunately should anyone in the physical world stumble upon your Brainwallets, they're unlikely to know what they are or what to do with them. But that's still bad practice.
What it sounds like you should do in your case is generate and print off a number of standard paper wallets with BIP38 encryption and load $2-$5 each per paper wallet, then make multiple copies of those paper wallets and store in various safe locations. This method is much more secure because someone would need physical access to your paper wallets to crack them (whereas people all over the world right this moment are attempting to crack your Brainwallet and everyone else's), and even with a mediocre password BIP38 is expensive and time consuming to brute force.
I highly recommend you go here and make some paper wallets and transfer over those Brainwallet coins.

A decentralized ledger cannot be maintained and protected without incentive. It is as plain and simple as that.
The money aspect of bitcoin is important. Without it there is no blockchain for people to care about.
