The people that got ultra rich (UHNWI) from Bitcoin are "nerds" into cryptography, hardcore libertarians, and mathematicians. As well as maybe a few other lucky early adopters (many niche forum users, people in the right place/right time, etc) These are the ultra rich. These are the people who mined/obtained what is tens of millions of dollars worth now. In some cases, billions.
People are still getting "rich" from Bitcoin, right now. Just not like they were in the early days.
Just admit you're bitter and be gone already.

I'm sure Satoshi is busy working on other things to be published posthumously. He/they is/are going to be one of those rare creators who receive recognition only after death. A modern day Shakespeare, if you will.
Maybe it will remain a mystery forever. 
I'd like to believe that he lives a normal life, or like a monk or something, walking around with a secret smile on his face, thinking about what else he can fix.
I hope he's doing alright, anyway.

Since 2010 (not long after Bitcoin first began to circulate), under the leadership of Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan Chase has been charged with 48 different violations of banking and securities fraud. $28,675,456,874.00 is the total they’ve paid out just in the past 7 years in slap-on-the-wrist fines by politicians who’s coffers they’ve filled with money. But no, hey, let's trust what these guys say. Seriously I'm chuckling at characters like you. I'll give you a fact, then you can do your own research:
In 2013 JP Morgan Chase was denied a patent for a Bitcoin clone over 175 times. Think about that.
Furthermore, $2.7bn was traded within the last 24 hours. You don't know what a pyramid scheme is, either.
