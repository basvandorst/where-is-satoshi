My brother complained about lags in CS:GO when I was running full node. 60/6Mbps
I would suggest to limit upload of computer with Bitcoin Core to about half of your connection upload speed.

You could do much, much worse with real quantum computer.
For example, breaking all SSL (this is what protects your communication with banks).
Bitcoin is almost unaffected and transition to quantum-proof algorithms would be easy.

"but didn't realize until now that he was prompted to write down a 15 character password which is used to encrypt the private key"
It's unlikely. During making the backup, Mycelium would first show the password and than ask to write what the password was. Unless you did it, it was showing big red warning that you do not have verified backup.
 
"Is there any chance at all that he can recover his coins without the password for the encrypted key? Is it possible to brute-force that password using some kind of a tool?"
No and no.
Sorry, but the password protection was specifically designed to protect private keys and to be immune to brute-force attack (by key stretching).

Here if you send money to wrong account, you cannot make bank reverse transaction (unless you have some special privilege) and they won't tell you who is recipient (because banking secrecy), so unless you know who is recipient, you don't know who you should sue for money return.

If escrow would be additional expense (instead of current situation where it is "standard" and there are legal issues with offering discounts), then I would expect multiple buyers to pay directly to reputable merchants.
