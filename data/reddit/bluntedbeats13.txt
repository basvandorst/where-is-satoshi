Seems that we were right.. as soon as south korea started trading again/banks starting to operate/offer bank accounts to exchanges the volume increased and prices went up in crypto market.i m expecting february to look like jan. High numbers in first 2 weeks. Sell off for profits in 2nd part. The agresive sell off s seem to be more often and i guess will be regular this year..personal toughts ;)

people forget that supply and demand is what moves the prices.that's it, nothing else. and right now demand has fallen due to many factors: market uncertainty and emotion, south korea new regulations and banks stopped for a short time to work with exchanges till they fix some things. end of jan the sk banks will+exchanges will be back fully operational with the new set of rules, new buyers will be in, demand will go up..that is it...wall street is making money on futures using advanced analysis of market movements, emotions, world news, 10s of years of trading experience,boots that can adapt to patterns etc...supply and demand it's what it is all about.the rest is paranoia and fud..learn the basics of trading anything in any type of environment.they all say: supply vs demand is moving prices.
if you dont believe me look at the trading volumes for main coins this week, drifting on low levels, meaning traders are not trading like in dec...everyone is waiting for new cash influx and a change in market emotion..my bet is south korea is a bigger part then we think in the demand part of trading.

Do you think that if i import the private key of the exodus wallet in electrum and then make a send order of the funds to electrum wallet with increased fees can fix it?
