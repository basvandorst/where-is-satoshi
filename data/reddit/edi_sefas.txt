Hey! why the dollar cow laughing? dollars should not be happy for mining its utimate death.

feel for you bro. But, the question is, whether the HODLing is enabling  WHALEs (by keeping it overpriced) or its the SODLers (by destroying the balance)? These are just noise, ignor'em.

true freedom will be, to see btc xchange  higher more and profit less. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:03:55
Secondly, even if it happens, nothing will change, cause mining will be there as usual, not for new coins, but for transaction fee. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:13:20
why? to test their nurve over a wrong spelling? :D
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:06:50
most Other cryptos also have limit, but, the change in algorithm is not hard. So, they can have any amount of coins.

No matter how much hashPower it adds, the algorithm resets it to be averaged 10min per BTC mined. Its a good deterrence for becomiing 51%. Hail Satoshi.

Soros is literally 'buy the dip' person. So, we are still gotta go further. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:02:23
First, its basically not possible to mine the last bit of bitcoin. So, it never happens

May be they are mining in guise of game.
