I think its possible. It looks like these institutions are using hashes as the information to timestamp on the blockchain. In that scenario, a miner would have to know what the hash means and then out mine the network. In that scenario the mining difficulty would be very low to low depending on the vastness of the network, and by extension bitcoin pricing would be purely based on utility which could be substantially small. but in any case people disrupting the network to change bitcoin ownership wouldn't be very profitable even if it was super easy.
SO the strength of the network wouldn't matter because only hashes are getting input to the network which are encrypted to the user's requirements.

it'll be fine, what will likely happen is a decrease in investment in mining equipment until the price rebounds.
There are estimates that point to miner's operating costs to $100-150/ bitcoin which should provide padding for reward halvings.

They could try that as much as they like, but Bitcoin DOESN'T SCALE, as of now. If fedcoin can figure out how to make an altcoin that scales as much as the U.S. Dollar with no problems than by all means it should be the winner.

increase in money supply = inflation.
and theres been a ton of inflation. look at the price of bitcoin in the last year and a half, price has been steadily downhill.
Strictly speaking though if the money supply increase matches the increase of the economic expansion, then there should be no recognizable inflation.

Freedom from the financial system is pretty cool, but at the end of the day it's not something i (or most people in my opinion) would pay extra money to accomplish.

Bet the price will rise regardless of what it goes for at auction.
The fact is that there are only going to be 10 winning bidders at the auction and a whole bunch of losers who are looking to get into bitcoin, but bid too low to acquire them from the Fed. Theyre going to be looking for bitcoin elsewhere at that point, either the BIT or on their own through exchanges. 
IMO anyone even interested in purchasing bitcoins at the auction are going to find ways to accumulate them for the long term.

Venmo and PayPal are only free between friends and family transfers bc it is monitized when people pay for services. They have the standard 3% transaction fees on those. Venmo is owned by PayPal and not a money making venture yet. Eventually as bitcoin gains popularity, they'll start eating away at the profitable aspects of venmo and PayPal which will probablyead to those services not being free anymore.
So for now it's way easier and cheaper for between friends but eventually it probably won't be the case.

In tax accounting, as with all accounting, whats called materiality plays a part in doing all those nitty gritty calculations.
Pretty much if those purchases and sales are going to be negligible on your tax return, and the effort to get all that data is a lot, then usually its not a big deal to not include them.
The worst the IRS would do is write you a letter if they catch it, with a bill for the exzpected amount you owe. but if youre using them at a loss, than you could respond back that they owe you in money in fact.
In any case, in the US you can deduct capital losses against your ordinary income, so its pretty much you leaving money on the table.

You absolutely can arbitrage, but only one way.
If someone is already invested in GBTC they can sell their shares OTC and then go back to BIT and reinvest for the same amount of shares. 
Investors with &gt;1 year holding period could arbitrage with the same amount of shares, while reducing their exposure by taking out their moolah (ie, selling the shares over the counter). It might be a wash sale or whatever, but they would still end up with hard cash while maintaining their GBTC/BTC exposure.

* you need to believe that bitcoin takes off in such a way that it's EXTREMELY easy to load it with coin, as easy as sending email. - It doesn't get more easy to use than having a device that continuosly operates by itself. 
* Secondly - If they're cloud mining with all the chips and then distributing it out afterwards there you have a steady supply of satoshis.
*It's like selling a car without fuel or an ability to refuel - It is the exact opposite of that. This is like selling you a car that does refuel. A) super awesome B) Most convenient

AFAIK lightning isn't close to being deployed (am I wrong?). Lightning isn't being worked on significantly, and bitcoin isn't scalable as it is right now. This all looks like very bad news. 
But you're a bitcoin expert apparently. bitcoin can't be massively adopted because the protocol isn't built for mainstream adoption. 6 months ago it seemed like Gavin had an actual plan for scalability which would at least allow the capability of mainstream adoption, but now it seems that there really is no plan.

I disagree. We will likely approach a point where Satoshi's intentions aren't relevant, but that time is probably decades from now. The heart of this debate is the question, "What is Bitcoin?". Mike is asserting that Bitcoin is what Satoshi's vision was. Satoshi's vision of p2p currency is very relevant to the debate. If you choose to ignore Bitcoin's origins than the answer to the question of what Bitcoin is can be severely downsized.
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:40:47
It seems like Bitcoins natural state is Bear Markets though. There is always a huge run up that attracts new users and then a secular bear market until a new batch of users arrives. If people expect a run up to 10,000 a bitcoin and a retraction to 3,000 than youre going to have a bunch of people hodling instead of spending again.

If they end up doing a bail-in, their 30grand would have been worth half as much, maybe even less. And the fact that that option is not even off the table? That's frightening to say the least. 
To say Bitcoin is a better option based on that feature, theres certainly an argument there. but in reality, no one expects volatility to decrease until the bitcoin inflation rate becomes more reasonable. And you know what? when Greece revisits this entire scenario in 3-4 years from it may very well be the case that bitcoin is a much more stable secure option than their greek bank accounts.

This is a super hard question.
If it drops to $180 from here youre going to be kicking yourself for buying in a hype period and your going to feel taken advantage of and stupid for buying a little bull market (and probably feel like selling).
On the other hand, if the market stabilizes at like $330 your going to feel like a hero for buying at the 'right time'.
If I were you, I would buy all in now, but really IMAGINE a scenario where the price falls 50%. Be ok with it. Mentally prepare yourself for the disappointment of losing your investment. 
But if you think the fundamentals are good and the prospects worth the risk I say take advantage of it. If the price indeed moves higher you'll also feel terrible for missing the train and not taking advantage of lower prices when you had the chance.

I think a lot of companies and VC's are turned off to supporting the Bitcoin foundation, but would support engineering the core technology. If I remember correctly. There were snippets of disapproval of the Bitcoin Foundation from Marc Andreessen among others because the foundation didn't want their input, just their money. 
It'll be interesting to see how it plays out. On a personal level I don't very much like the opinions and attitudes of foundation board members myself.

Goldman Sachs eouod only invest money into Bitcoin if they had an immediate buyer to offload to. They have no interest in holding any financial instrument. Take the recent purchase of Venezuelan bonds, they made a killing on them BC THEY ALREADY HAD BUYERS. Why would they buy and hold something with a huge amount of risk, when they never hold anything with a huge amount of risk? It would be a poor business practice.
Also, and this is indicative of early stages of Bitcoin. There's no real way to buy bitcoins and have a bank hold onto them without the risk of employees stealing th funds. With that said they would have to structure a fund that would specialize in Bitcoin and the. Offer that to its investors, so pretty much identical to what GBTC does. But once again, they would never risk the banks money to do that, they would be selling it to their clients as investments.
TLDR; GS would never buy Bitcoins with bank fiat

If it functioned like an ETF than the price of trades would follow almost exactly the actual price of BTC by buying and selling the underlying asset.

send one satoshi from an address that has more than 1 bitcoin, registration remains valid as long as the proven address stays liquid. At least trolls would have to buy a bitcoin in order to bash it

If LYFT doesnt start accepting bitcoins soon, I'm going to be peeved. I take uber now, but now that Lyft is 5 lines of computer code away from accepting it...I would be a Lyft user forever.

You pretty much described Stripe's business model. Payment processing accepted with just a few lines of code. untested? Fully tested. entirely new? been around for a while. arguably controversial? arguably not controversial. This shouldn't be too big of a deal

We live in a world where the pizza makers charge the same for pizza, but the pizza pies are getting a little smaller every year. Bitcoins changing the world so that the pizza pies are getting a little bigger every year.
They're doing it by saving money bc now the way to buy pizza with money is to pay the delivery boy to go to the bank for you which turns out is very expensive and makes no sense. Bitcoin makes it so that the delivery boy only delivers pizza, and instead of tipping him $5 for all that bank work, were giving $.01 to computer nerds to do that hard work using the internet.

IT really shouldn't. If you lock away money in a deep vault and the people holding the keys to it die in an unfortunate drone strike, ISIL could still get that money and use it for stuff. 
Terrorists die all the time, there would be no way for them to secure their private keys without losing massive amounts of btc.

But their using the blockchain technology as a public ledger. Bitcoin hasn't even figured out how to do it optimally yet

Totally agree, except IMO the year to make it or break it is really 2024. The effective inflation rate is much higher since there are so many bitcoins not circulating.
