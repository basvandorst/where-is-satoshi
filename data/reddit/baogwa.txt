You're aware you can buy and sell fractions of a Bitcoin right?

Yeah I mean, if State laws can't supercede federal laws then what's the point of even pretending we have a say at all, or that voting even means anything in the first place?

I'm new-ish at this, but couldn't you have done an instant transfer into a usd wallet to "freeze" the value and then withdraw from there?

Ohhhh, I think I get what you're saying now!  Damn that sucks dude.  Like for example, I just bought $10 worth of BTC for the hell of it.  Coinbase is like "derr, your coins will be available in six days.”  But if the value plummets then it could be like I actually only bought​ $1 worth by the time I get it?

Good to know. Well, at least you and I leaned from it!  I've heard worse horror stories, like the guy who bought a pizza for 10 BTC and whatnot.  I was mining for like $80+ per day when Zcoin first came out, but I spent it all renting hashing power thinking I found a way to quit my job and make infinite free money... Nope lost it all right away.  Even  if it crashes down to $1000 or whatever right now, I think it'll bounce back much stronger.  Wise to hodl, I think.

I totally understand and relate to that.  I feel like ETH has potential, mainly since it has the most media buzz besides BTC.  Also It seems like it's really taking off in a big way for the first time right now.  It might be like when BTC seemed like a joke and now I want to stab my eyeballs out with a screwdriver for not buying some...  
I don't actually have money to invest anyways so I'll probably miss out either way.
