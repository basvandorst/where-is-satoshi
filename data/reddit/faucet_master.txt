Nope. All fair play. Just some referrals.

Send me a PM and I will give you a list of faucets that in 1 week you get in total double or triple than that.  
The 2nd answer is that if you are capable to do another work, is much better not to wast your time.  
 is a good start.  
But if you have another income and you have plenty of free time and you want to earn BTC just playing faucets, yes is possible even to earn more than $1/day, but I don't see it like that. I see it that you earn free 100 million satoshis/month.

those facets are giving dust. There are many others that give much more than those that you recommend. You should review your list.

I play faucets for years and if you have patience and determination you can earn some good amounts, but not to live on.  
There are tons of faucets out there but be careful which you choose, some are not paying, some are paying too low and you wats your time.  
The last ones I play and they pay weekly and nice are:  
dailydoge.org and bitcoinaliens.com - register both with same btc address and email and you receive from both in the same time the balance. They are serious and for a long time.  
bonusbitcoin.co - is good and pay well  
satoshinow.com - great rewards! 0.01btc/week  
freebitco.in - one of the oldest faucets and serious  
epay.info - facet rotator, quite serious but they lowered the rewards.  
Good luck!

Yes, I played faucets from 2010-2011 and I still have those coins from early days...  
I have plenty of time and I want to obtain as much as I can BTC and I don't want to pay for them.  
I don't understand what is people problem if I want to play faucets?  
What you get today maybe for some worth shit, but tomorrow will worth a lot.

SCAM SCAM SCAM!  
This site is the same "team" from satoshinow.com that is not paying anymore the players. Now they just change the domain name, change the colors of the faucet and say is a new faucet that pays.  
You play on your own risk.  
Trusted faucets are only those which pays through faucetbox, xapo or similar. These that promise to pay high rewards after x days are 99% scams.
