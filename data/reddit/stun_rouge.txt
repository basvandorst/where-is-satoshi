As much as this is nice, I'm a little skeptical due to the nature of politics in Belarus. While there is no true laissez faire market in the world yet (as far as I'm aware, but I could be wrong), they have yet to experience their own "Euromaidan", let alone true free market trading.

I’d love to see a bronzed statue though, or at least that nobel peace prize push through! He’s practically saved lives in starving countries with hyperinflating currencies.

I'm not completely comfortable with the idea of this...not only is Bitcoin not ready for mass production yet, but the available local exchanges have KYC. If they can make decentralized, crypto-friendly legislation that doesn't benefit to BSP or BIR in any way, then I'm all for it going mainstream.

Out of all alts spoken of in this sub, Litecoin and Dogecoin are probably more tolerated than most. I like to think of the Cryptocurrencies as a neighborhood of sorts, like Bitcoin being the big brother, Litecoin being the little brother, Doge the...pet dog. Ether is probably that neighbor walking a barking chihuahua while Monero is that neighbor with the blinds and binoculars always watching.
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:44:54
You mean mining? Theoretically yes, but realistically, it's very murky waters. The existence of ASICs and mining pools throw that definition out the window. If you want to solo mine, it's far easier to win the lottery 5 consecutive times in a row, get struck by lightning thrice while being on the same spot, and get a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than solving the algorithm and acquiring the bitcoin rewards + transaction fees.

I’m new so I’m not exactly the most reliable advisor, but this is what I learned: 
Buy and diversify your portfolio, keep track of your currencies on either exchanges or app portfolios like Blockfolio or Delta. ALWAYS read the whitepaper. If storing large amounts, get a hardware wallet and do not store your word sheet in the sock drawer, or take a picture of it, or even encode it on notepad. If extremely worried about security against five-dollar wrenches, get MACE.��

How did you arrive at such conclusions? You may speak high and lofty words on the soap box but swift brevity is preferred on these grounds if you would care to prove your assertions on this public forum, or should I say, ELI5. Mayhap you should speak to those who develop this revolutionary craft rather than stand here and take a beating with verbal lashing?
As all things, love of money is the root of all evil but money itself is not evil. From where are your proofs that you would declaim such a rhetoric speaking of bitcoin’s supposed status as a malefaction? You must remember if you come trodding upon the ground of the opposition to present your case, what then if you speak your conviction with nary a thought on how you shall respond between your accusations when you are asked for your backing.
Everyone else: not sure if troll or pretentious academiac. If he is the real deal, muster your conviction to rebuke this person, but please do so with grace.�� This is my first and last statement on this topic.

That’s some food for thought. �� I have to admit, it’s usually very hard to extend kindness or give a second thought to anyone that isn’t tied to one’s self in any way. �� Like road infrastructure, who would build it if there were no such thing as taxes. Volunteerism can only get people so far and that’s only if someone is very willing to donate or spearhead the project. Then there’s also the chance that the engineer in charge will just hoard away the bitcoin and disappear to parts unknown.�� I like bitcoin, but if it will ever become adopted en-masse there are some considerations which must be observed.
Thank you for the food for thought. ��

Actually, that's what I'm doing and the reason why I can't invest at around a dollar everyday unless there's a windfall (though I plan to invest a dollar a day once 2018 arrives). Other than the relatively high Forex rate, living expenses take a large chunk of money, and the rest goes to a bank account as a nest egg, and I have blue chips stocks sitting as a precaution.
I don't know if it's completely foolproof, but having a bank account where most of the money goes after paying personal and living expenses is at least sensible, so we can agree on that. :)

Perhaps it’s more of spreading the word for coverage. Depending on degree of priority, what is more important for example, a nearly unheard of AIDS hospice in a mud hut community somewhere in the heart of Africa, or an orphanage in the middle of an urban center in a developed country where the government subsidizes funds from taxes anyway? �� I could be wrong though, so who knows honestly?

I feel the same way.��
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:46:28
The thing about charitability is that it’s hard to find the perfect balance between priority and preference.��
For example, a nice old lady has a hundred she’d like to donate and she’s an animal lover. One day two charities went up to her house at the same time asking for donations, one for a sick child in Africa with AIDS due to die in the next week because of a cold and the weakened immune system, and the other to fund a dog’s operation because some kids got their sick kicks by torturing the poor animal beyond recognition in a developed country. �� They’d pick the dog almost all of the time.��
What about something that provides perpetual self-sustainance when kickstarted or maybe has a ripple effect?
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:11:46
You won’t get much of a constructive discussion around these parts since November, sadly.�� If its any consolation, Mr. Antonopolous himself said, and I quote, “Reddit, I'm talking about you.” ��I wouldn’t know if lying low is best right now, but if you feel that strongly about it, you might find some others in the r/BitcoinTechnology sub. �� 
Good luck!

Hmmm…I won’t assume to know the mistake though I have a vague idea.�� It’s something that can’t be helped, and all you can do is find closure, since a door may very well never open again.��
If that is the gift you want to give, it’s just something not done. I won’t say why on the risk of agitating you, but perhaps maybe just a one-flower bouquet and an “I’m sorry” note instead of financial advice?��
Regardless, good luck, whatever your decision may be. ��
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:49:52
Oh I see ��now I know, thank you. ��
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:25:05
It’s not illegal��I never said that. It’s just not commonly allowed to bring in and out more than 10,000 dollars in the US in cash��.
If it’ll be illegal is another thing altogether.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:59:33
Oh I see, so it’s like a cryptocurrency ticker?
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:48:13
You also have to consider the fact that some of them belong to countries that aren’t serviced by major exchanges, let alone exchanges that use SegWit. �� There are a number of factors, but yes, there are some also who complain just because.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:56:07
This is a very long line! �� At least it’s not too late yet, I hope.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:45:53
That’s okay �� I have pretty much the same amount since I’m relatively new. What I did was put it in a soft wallet that checks out as legit at netbusinessreview, then once I reach around a satisfactory amount, I transfer it to a hardware wallet. I don’t know if it’s the right method though, since like I said, I’m new ��. There’s also paper wallets, but you need to self-laminate them to protect from damage, and a safe storage place for those.��
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:08:48
�� that was very colorful�� I’m new here, but I’m here because I like the technology even though I’m no cypherpunk. I also have semi-anarchistic ideals and from a “developing country”. Nice to meet you. ��
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:37:34
Well that’s really confusing��if he doesn’t care why did he even bother making a video about it?��
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:29:11
Aren’t those Chuck E Cheese tokens? �� It’s a play on the news how some scammer sold people Chuck E Cheese tokens for Bitcoin.��
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:55:11
Good job�� and good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:49:01
Oh I see. �� That’s a good site then.

Not in firefox it won’t…��it’s okay now though
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:35:03
Good luck :) hopefully you'll recover it soon.
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:38:34
Don’t go.�� It’s so hard to find magnanimous people in this soulless world. Even if you gave it all away already we still need an inspirational figure and symbol of virtue to keep our heads on our shoulders…
@_date: 2018-05-12 11:31:47
Wow �� where in Kyiv was this?
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:48:32
Or you can buy coin with a credit card from a legitimate exchange, though I’m not sure that’s safer.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:20:55
It’s a very bad idea because she could be skeptical of your intentions and hate you more, or be attracted to you again for all the wrong reasons. �� The fickleness and devotion of the human heart is not to be underestimated, ever.�� If you mean to win her back, do so with an apology and a proper courtship, but never speak about money, and don’t give into the temptation of buying back her affection even subconsciously.��
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:31:06
I'll go take a look then, thank you. :D Is Liquid in it too? :) 
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:12:03
What’s step 2 and 3?��
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:39:35
I don’t think so.�� Mining and running a node isn’t the same from what I heard. I’d sure love to get paid for doing something I like doing though, instead of working a desk job 8 hours a day. ��
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:56:28
Nothing much. It contributes to the transparency of the blockchain though. ��
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:36:44
Thank you ��
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:06:36
There are workshops? �� You mean like online seminars or the entire archives of the Nakamoto Institute and Jameson Lopp's links? Or is that something else altogether?
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:16:46
Good luck!�� I’ll look at it too.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:09:37
Thank you, I’ll go try it. ��
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:56:32
It was alright yesterday at my home, but when I went to work today (and taking my laptop which has the node) with me, it's unreachable.�� How do I fix it? I have the client up and running right now and it's updated again.  
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:43:02
Thank you! I already read the Whitepaper, all of the documented links in Jameson Lopp’s site, as well as 25% of what is in the Nakamoto Institute site.�� What else can I read?
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:15:35
Alright, so what should I do about it? Remember to use clean and concise words since I'm still relatively new to all this, please? ��
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:48:32
How do I do that? ��
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:34:02
No, sorry, just the blockchain on the Bitcoin Core client ��I’d be interested in learning how to set up a mainnet Lightning node once it’s stable though.��
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:10:23
Thank you. ��
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:09:59
I’ll go try this too then, thank you.��
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:02:39
Yes, I've read and watched them all; though I hope nobody expects me to remember all of it or understand completely since I'm not a techie. :D I saw the link for the NOOC too so I just signed up for that one. :)
I wish they had emoji icons for Reddit on computers.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:03:42
How does that work? �� I just downloaded the blockchain and keep the client running in the background while I work or play with other stuff.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:19:17
I’m confused now. ��
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:11:11
A micronation that runs on cryptocurrency? What are the official grounds for a referendum of secession though?
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:41:51
I like Segwit, it's very helpful. So far I heard Layer 2 for the bitcoin blockchain are RSK, Liquid, and LN, but I have no true idea how any of those work. I read the whitepapers, but a lot of the terms escaped me.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:58:09
I don’t know how to set up an LN node. ��I’d be willing to learn though if somebody can set up an instruction booklet using Layman’s Terms.☺️
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:08:49
I’m confused now.��
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:56:59
So I just type my IP and then the port there?��
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:31:29
I don't get it. �� Sorry, I'm still new to this and I don't understand much without explanation...
Should I have my full node mining too?
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:14:34
Ohhh ��
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:22:56
I'm not sure if this is serious or a parody of Mr. Ver's undesirable charlatanistic tendencies.
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:46:41
I don't think we have a library except the national one in my country. The other libraries are all university and college libraries, which means they're off-limits. If it helps, I attend graduate school and they have an entire degree for Data Science. ��
 I'm also not good with speaking in front of people though :(  
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:32:26
Ally? You mean like that silly "core-cash" argument others are having? �� I don't understand anything wrong with what those from the btc subreddit claim (since I'm not really smart when it comes to tech talk) but I can't respect their spokesperson because I feel as though he's very unethical for what he's done. Doxxing customer information and tweeting about someone's financial status to "rub it in" is clearly in poor taste.
Unless you meant something else? ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:29:05
Oh��what’s the link?
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:34:23
I could point them out to the .org site, the Nakamoto Institute, and Lopp's archives. Does that work?
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:44:50
Is there a link or instruction booklet for that?��
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:16:21
That's a cute username. :D Alright.
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:37:16
Which do you think is best? ��
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:32:44
Oh that. I already do that, though it's not really connected to the node. I get my bitcoin from local exchanges, and I once bought a game with it, and a US itunes card from a sub-dealer. �� The rest are in cold storage, slowly saving up until I can get one whole bitcoin, though I'm very far off.
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:32:11
Done, and I have a USB miner stick I got out of curiosity and use it with cgminer, but how does that help with the node?
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:19:35
Do you have an instruction sheet for it? �� 
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:44:06
Yes, so I heard.�� That’s why I’m slightly hesitant myself, because mainnet is told to be not ready yet.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:10:15
So what should I do? �� I'm even more confused on who's right now.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:01:59
Is that right?�� Okay, I’ll do that ☺️
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:13:11
I don’t think running a node pays any money.�� Does it? ��
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:11:19
A podcast on bitcoin?�� Interesting!
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:16:02
I don’t think I can afford an S9 or 16T, but maybe on the GPU just to start?��
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:27:14
Done, both my hot and cold wallets are segwit. :D
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:12:50
I’ll go look at your post history then. ��
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:18:06
I want to be a part of the future too, but just for me, I think it’s more sensible to test the prototype (testnet) instead of jumping the gone with an incomplete product (mainnet) that depends on the prototype’s completion.�� I want to know the most productive way to contribute while being prudent.��
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:27:46
Alright ��I’ll try and find some instructions. Thank you very much ��
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:37:28
I would love to learn to run the node with TOR �� Running a node is essentially increasing the correctness of audited entries in the ledger, at least, as far as I’m aware. �� I’m relatively new so I don’t have a good explanation for it. I just do it because it aligned with my ideals.��
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:55:42
Oh thank you but…I don’t use Ubuntu, or Linux. ��
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:33:34
I'll take that advice with a grain of salt. I heard the mainnet isn't ready yet, so I'm confused why everyone is charging forward despite warnings not to use it yet. ��
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:23:54
The best thing is, it means we can but more.��
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:13:33
Thank you.��
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:29:51
They're here? I don't see anyone from the btc subreddit here though. I read the whitepaper and even watched the videos, but I'm still not sure how it truly works. :(
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:32:34
Oh my! Thank you so much and 恭喜发财  :)
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:46:57
What was in them?��
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:48:58
Alright ��
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:58:03
I’m not really familiar with how things are on the other side of the pond. What’s being sold? ��
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:40:57
A full node �� it took a lot of time but I’m happy I can contribute even just a tiny bit.
@_date: 2018-07-28 15:24:20
Oh, thanks ��I thought they were separate signs.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:07:52
Thank you! ��
Edit: Oh this. I already read this, but the last paragraph on step 8 isn't really very clear to me I'm afraid. I even pressed on the link another site led me too, and it seemed very complicated. I have a willingness to learn but I don't know what I'd be doing and be running blind. ��
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:19:35
How?��
