Do people really buy after seeing random beverage ads? How about random car ads? Random clothing ads? Random random ads? Your logic is flawed.  You must be an adolescent.

How can a currency work if all the private keys are lost and no coins can be divided because no one has access to them.  
@_date: 2018-09-21 15:52:45
Fair enough.  
@_date: 2018-09-26 23:38:20
ECON101 might help you out.  Not worth replying to someone that doesn't understand the fundamentals of advertisement.  Your logic makes zero sense.  You are saying an advertisement means "it stops you from buying something else..."  The point of an ad is so you buy what is on the ad, not another product..... lol your perception of the world is off.

Forks of BTC don't go well... just look from the already 10+ forks and how they aren't used.  I already addressed the BTC divisibility option, but dividing each BTC by infinite decimals defeats the purpose.  What happens if that 1 BTC gets lost and there are no more coins to divide? That is the question.  There should be a way to distribute lost coins rather than create new ones. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 00:23:45
Agreed.  Crypto is the next evolution of money.
@_date: 2018-09-24 22:50:20
Right.... as in the guy that can't code "Hello World," has zero affiliation with crypto, and publicly said he never heard of Bitcoin until this publicity.  Remind me again what the importance of someone who has nothing to do with BTC?

The time to buy is anytime the price is down.  If you are thinking short term day trades, swing trades, you increase your risk.  Just buy and HODL until 2020 when we come out of the bull market and break the ATH.  Sell then and buy the crash again, the only difference will be the market cap will be in the trillions.  Then, HODL again.  Bunch of newbs in this space.

BTC "crashed" 8 times and after each consolidation period, the longest being 3 years, it broke all time highs.  The same logic can be applied here.  Simply hold on until the next ride because crypto will only become more adopted over time, not less.  Use your rational thinking to see forward, as it is a skill required to have as an investor.  Your statement, gives me the feeling that you still haven't learned enough.

This is why it's good to have an exit strategy which for me, is holding for at least 5 years after date of purchase.  I don't plan on selling until my portfolio reaches a minimum of 7 figures.  But, if it can hit 7 it can hit 8 and so on.  It's all speculation at this point and very little use case.
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:12:08
Fun fact: it takes zero additional capital to bump the price up.  People could unanimously decide to trade  at $100k right now with the current market cap and supply simply because people deem it so.  
I agree with most everything else.

XRP has the most use case and adoption of any digital asset.  Wise move.  
@_date: 2019-04-05 03:12:48

Buying the dip is a bull market strategy.  This is a bear market.  You don't buy the dip you wait for the bottom and then buy dips upon confirmations on an uptrend.

False: as the market matures the top and bottom ranges will not be as extreme.

BTC is not a hedge because it is a risky experimental asset class.  Metals are a hedge against inflation.  BTC is not digital gold, yet.  It needs to mature before it becomes a hedge option.  Your logic is flawed.  Good try tho. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:40:13
If BTC was a hedge against FIAT you'd see a direct correlation with the stock market, yet both are falling at the same time.  Therefore, it is not yet a hedge.

You can track the dollar but you can't track what was bought with it.  If some kid buys weed locally with a dollar he got on vacation out of state and then the dealer spends it in another state, there is no way the serial number can show any record of that drug deal.

Multiply the price of BTC by the quantity...
@_date: 2019-09-04 17:26:13
I stopped reading after the first sentence because you aren't comprehending what I am saying.  I am not talking about tracking a business deal, I am talking about LITERALLY untraceable transactions.  
If you go to a garage sale and hand someone cash, and that person uses your bill to pay for a good or service, there is ZERO traceable activity that the government (or anyone else) can use to know that you gave them that bill.  
Learn the differences.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:47:51
If I do a shady back-alley deal there is zero chance that transaction can be traced.

BTC is not a bubble lmao.  Neither is Facebook.  A bubble means that the business or product has zero use case and zero value as the bubble exists from a short lived FAD.  Facebook and BTC both have utility and is not a FAD.  Neither are bubbles.  Learn your terms.  Stocks go up and down.  Nothing goes up forever, and when the price goes down there is no bubble to be popped because you make money shorting.  Newb.

4200-4400 then short to 2.5-1.8k.  THEN we should find the bottom and launch up to 100k.  The next bubble should "pop" and the next bottom will be around 30k.  Then up we go to never see 5 digits again. \*not financial advice\*
