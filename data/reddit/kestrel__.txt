Awesome! Great company from the looks of it so congrats :)
Right now I have 4 options to choose from and subledger is one of them, I will let you know if I have any questions!

I just stumbled upon that, is it still beta though?

Can you give me some reasons why you think CoinCPA is the right choice? 
Really interested in this one.

Storj can be utilized by companies too, so the enterprise side of it all is a massive market Storj will try to get into.
Also, regarding your streaming point, that data has to be stored somewhere unless it is live, which eventually is archived and stored. So cloud storage is only going to grow if you ask me.

I am thinking about developing this idea further...

Give Coinigy a try - they let you connect via API and trade even when the websites of the exchanges are down.
