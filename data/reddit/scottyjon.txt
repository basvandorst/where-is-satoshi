let me tell you my story. About one week ago today i was hanging out with my friend just talking shit and the topic moved to bitcoins. He told me how he had been following the news on the bitcoin for a while now and was telling me how he planned on investing 10k. I listened and was very intrigued. I left later that day and did some research when i got home. The price was currently $200 per bitcoin so i thought perhaps that was a little to pricey and decided to see if the price fell in a day or 2 since the price is so volatile. Not even a week the the price was sitting on $400 WTF! i thought. I then started thinking if it was worth the investment i was originally planning. I then obsesed over learning everyhting i could about the bitcoin and its possible future and decided it was now or never since it was likely prices would never be this low again. Im now the proud owner of (x) amount of coins and im excited for what the future bring. I hope this helps with your desicion and i also hope this paragraph strings together properly since i just came from if you get my drift . . .

Why do people seem to think the american senate is the fate of bitcoins? America is a single country of the world, are so many of you so self centred?
