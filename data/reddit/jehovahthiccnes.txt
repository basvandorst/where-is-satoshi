Surprised the CoolWallet S isnt on there. It's a great 2FA hardware wallet.

I mean. The idea of decentralized banking is something most libertarians are for. But whose to say that you can't be a Democrat, Republican, etc that agrees with that too? How you invest shouldn't be directly related to your political ideology.

Talk to your parents on your interest in investing. Perhaps even offer your "allowance" to be in Bitcoin. Or you can find Bitcoin ATMs and some of the ones I've seen take cash and convert them to BTC. So all you would need is a wallet address.

Atlas should be the "US dollar" holding the US dollar.

The transaction times are at the exact same time. Like you sent 2 ETH to one address and at the same time it went to another, according to the ledger. It may have assigned it as another address but still went to the address you intended to send it to. Dumb question but did you double check your receipt address? Check the wallet to see if its there.

So I'm 95% certain you got scammed. This is the final address the money went to. The other address sent your ETH to this address. 0xca7445ea346b099be94d7fecca2979734f690ba1
This definitely looks like you were hacked. I'm sorry dude, that really sucks. Definitely invest in a hardware wallet.

Bro you're so funny. Hahaha omg. That's top tier comedy right there. Who would've thought that I meant anything other than a financial IRA or retirement plan.

So I'm asking cause I want to know what the average person on this subreddit does. I do DCA already and have been for a long time.
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:43:20
Shit you're right. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:43:49
Thanks for your info! I wont use them and will look into my own IRA.

Hodling till I have a lambo in my garage and a rocket ship in the backyard.

I think BTC is for lack of a better term, the gold standard of crypto. For Libra, it will be a nice gap filler and starting place for newcomers. I'm definitely going to pump a good bit into Libra as well as continuing to invest in BTC.

I'm not sure how you would go about doing this. Find a legitimate BTC mixer. Or buy Monero and use Changelly to convert it to BTC maybe idk

Congratulations, you played yourself.

@_date: 2019-09-22 01:03:38
