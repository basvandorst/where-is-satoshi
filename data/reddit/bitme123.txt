Well my point was that Tom Lee has no clue what he is talking about. 
Regarding the smart contracts: I wouldn't say so. The most basic smart contract that escrows value is a multi-sig contract and Ethereum still can't get this to work. 
What distinguishes Ethereum from Bitcoin is that it is centralized, it has crappy devs, it can't scale and it's buggy as shit. :)

That small quote in response to a leading question along the lines: "Bitcoin is bad! It is used for illegal activities by bad people and is used to hide money from YOU from the government!! Isn't that an area where you should try to clamp down to?" made it into a headline out of a ~10m interview.

Strictly speaking I guess that you're right, but why not make it more obvious that Lit is an incompatible implementation to the Lightning Network known to most users, which is the Lightning Network supported by BOLT compliant clients (LND, c-lightning, Eclair) that has all the momentum at this moment?

10k chars:
1/ TWEETSTORM about  BIG REVEAL. This is long &amp; info-packed, so buckle in. My native state is about to do bigger things for  &amp; the sector is about to pay Wyoming back big-time. Win-win!     
2/ \[..\]
3/ New bill 2 parts. 1-Digital asset custody via   wld create first true  for digital assets (for investors who by law can’t self-custody). 2-Defines property rights for digital assets—doing something HUGELY IMPT for  currencies
4/ Link to the proposed bill—Sen Tara Nethercott main sponsor; leadership of both houses co-sponsors; bi-partisan \[..\] It’s pretty human-readable. Lawyers will geek out on it &amp; technologists will see we had a lot of input from people who know what they’re doing
5/ Highlights=Choice of custody as  (consumer still owns coins so isn't forced into debtor/creditor relationship w/ intermediary, as is the case w/ securities), OR consumer can choose pooled custody but wld bear all risk of losses ( Big consumer protections
6/ PLUS legal clarity regarding status of digital assets &amp; how lenders can enforce liens on them (thus facilitating good  AND...drum roll...wait for it… &amp; other virtual currencies are subject to same super-negotiability rules as money(!!!)
7/ That treatment solves what some called  Achilles heel—that old liens may pop up years later &amp; hurt owners. The bill proposes that liens expire after 2 yrs—that’s a HUGE reason to store coins in a Wyoming custodian (cleanse them of possible unknown liens). 
8/ Next, definitions:  law recognizes 3 types of digital assets—digital securities, digital consumer assets ( &amp;  (incl  All 3 types are issued, traded &amp; settled on blockchain so their custody is v different than trad. custody biz
9/  banks would have option to OPT INTO an enhanced regulatory regime for digital asset custody which meets   requirements, incl surprise audits. Why important? This is a  not a  Banks can do biz in all 50 states but trust cos can’t
10/ Also-trust cos are also excluded from definition of “securities intermediary” under UCC Article 8, but banks are included. More important tho,  has raised questions abt trust cos as  (esp lack of clarity if a trust company ever goes bust). The 
11/  on its face permits trust cos to be QCs but try to get a legal opinion on that!  bill specifically addresses  concerns &amp; allows a  to be a  for digital assets (w/ clear wind-up rules if the bank ever goes bust).
12/ Wearing my former hat as a  of pension plans &amp; an endowment I asked what fiduciaries of big institutional investors will require to invest in this asset class. They can't agree to the vague, one-sided contracts commonly used by digital asset exchanges today. For ex,
13/ a contract that defines  vaguely as “a digital asset” or says “we have sole discretion regarding forks &amp; airdrops” won’t cut it. Sorry, such vague, one-sided terms won’t pass muster of big-time  Time to get professional. Tell clients which version
14/ of source code you’re using for each coin &amp; put it in the contract. If you’re a directed custodian, all value belongs to your customers—not you—unless you &amp; your clients expressly agree to share fork/airdrop/staking gains. Of course, custodians can still pick which forks &amp;
15/ airdrops to support but must provide a way for customer to claim all unclaimed forks &amp; airdrops (eg, roll keys &amp; give customers old keys so they have option to claim unclaimed value). And…NO REHYPOTHECATION. Not happening in  where our laws protect  RIGHTS.
16/  is a form of  3-Card Monte. If an asset has already been pledged as collateral for a loan once, re-pledging that same asset for a new &amp; different loan is fraud. In NY, that’s legal (&amp; it wins bankers big bonuses). In WY, that’s a crime (&amp; it could
17/ land you in jail--  A  Supreme Ct case (SmithvState, 1986) upheld a criminal conviction for  of diamonds. Yes, I know  is rampant in traditional financial mkts, but that doesn’t make it right.
18/ Financial institutions that  are insolvent by def'n &amp; are at risk of a bank run. But it's especially dangerous to rehypothecate digital assets bc they’re scarce &amp; there’s no lender of last resort. Failing to deliver a digital asset=default, period. 
19/ So, if you must use a custodian, use a  custodian--nowhere else will your property rights in digital assets be better protected. STAY AWAY from NY especially, bc NY permits  &amp; allows failures to deliver. WY protects investor rights better than NY does!
20/ So the proposed bill enables the first crop of institutional-quality digital asset custodians. Investors get true protection. Custodians get optimal license regime + legal clarity. But there’s more. Customers of a  enhanced digital asset custodian aren’t forced into a
21/ a debtor/creditor relationship—customer can elect a bailment (a common-law term where you still hold title to your coins even tho you give control to the custodian). Best example of a bailment=valet parking (you retain title to your car but give up control). How does this
22/ jive with  It doesn’t, clearly. It’s inferior to holding your own private keys. But it addresses the reality that big institutional investors &amp; investment advisers are required by law to hold assets in a 3rd party custodian. All 3rd parties=
23/ security risks, but until Congress changes   it’s the law of the land. 2nd best is you retain title to your coins but give control to a  custodian via a non-fungible  where custodian owes you a fiduciary duty of care. 3rd best =
24/ you choose to allow your custodian to pool your coins in an omnibus account &amp; you participate in gains from financing/staking, etc. But if you do that &amp; your custodian fails, you won’t be bailed out. All fair, all clearly disclosed &amp; acknowledged by contract. No surprises!
25/ So, that’s custody. Now let’s move to legal clarity. Commercial law in the US is defined by state laws called UCC.  isn’t changing its UCC but is adding an addendum to classify UCC treatment of digital assets. This ties back to the 
26/ concern about the wind-up of an insolvent financial institution, bc bankruptcy judges look to state law to determine the nature &amp; quality of an asset--&amp; if state law isn’t clear, no one knows how a bankruptcy judge will handle it. One wonders why no other state has clarified
27/ this yet—it’s not rocket science &amp;  isn’t inventing anything new (except a new def'n of control that reflects how the tech actually works). Wyoming is giving a clear roadmap to lawyers &amp; judges that REFLECTS THE TECHNOLOGY. Plus it allows a  to control
28/ a digital asset. Most lawyers will appreciate this &amp; technologists shld see that these rules reflect (enable!!) the peer-to-peer reality of  technology. We've been deep in the weeds on these topics &amp; studied an alternative proposal for digital assets under UCC that
29/ wld require owner to keep digital assets at an intermediary--sorry that's just WRONG! This is fundamentally peer-to-peer technology &amp; Wyoming's proposed law affirms this (you can still choose to use an intermediary, but aren't forced to do so to gain legal recognition of your
30/ PROPERTY RIGHTS in your digital assets). Had other states enacted that requirement (to own coins via an intermediary) before WY came in for the BIG SAVE, it would've been a disaster for  IMHO. That proposal would have turned direct ownership into indirect
31/ ownership &amp; turned a direct PROPERTY RIGHT into an IOU. That’s how securities work—you don’t directly own your stocks anymore; you own an IOU from your broker/dealer via layers of intermediaries. But that legal regime is the cause of many probs in securities (eg, Dole Food
32/ litigation-Dole had 36.8mil shares outstanding but 49.2m valid claims were filed for the 36.8m, all w/ valid brokerage statements as proof.) Indirect ownership (IOUs) is an awful legal regime for investor protection! Would be esp bad for digital assets \[..\]
33/ Leadership in  gets this-- has a long tradition of respecting PROPERTY RIGHTS. If this bill passes, Wyoming bank charters become more valuable &amp; I will continue to volunteer to make this win-win for the State of Wyoming and the best  companies!
34/36 \[..\]
37/ for  for  sector, superior regulatory path to  of digital assets.  Digital asset industry is $125 billion today. Securities custody industry today is $114 trillion but growing slice of that $114 trn of securities will be issued on
38/  ( recently issued A$110 million bond in digital-asset form). A chunk of that $114 trillion will migrate from trad. custodians to digital-asset custodians, &amp;  should dominate--remember, only a WY custodian can cleanse old liens after 2 years!
39/ But there’s more--diff bills also propose to authorize a special purpose depository institution, fintech sandbox, Sec of State integrating w/ a  tokenized securities + a chancery court. Plus the Governor &amp; Sec of State gave shout-outs to  in inaugural
40/ speeches last week. Zero income taxes. No property tax on digital assets. Very business friendly. \[..\]

Let's say purely hypothetically speaking, it would be possible to amend the Bitcoin Core license in this way and it was amended with such conditions, then it would now at least require that signees of the NYA requirement would have to act more ethical if they were to use the Bitcoin Core software or alternatively develop their own S2X client.

Let's say for argument's sake that it doesn't pan out like you said and the Core devs remain united in not supporting the S2x thing; neither the Core devs nor the NYA peeps care to build strong replay protection; and hash rate and economic support has a different distribution for example 70% segwit 2x - 30% original chain; 50/50; or 30% segwit 2x - 70% original chain.

what baffles me is that all the amazing(!) work the Core team puts into the development of the Bitcoin Core client can be forked with the press of a button, modified and then used to directly attack the network.
Shouldn't an IP lawyer be able to amend the MIT license, without limiting Core's rights, with conditions that require licensees to only use or modify the software in an ethical way, hence forcing them to play nicely and not directly attacking the network?
[For example: the condition that strong replay protection is required if consensus rule changes are implemented in derived works -- just pulling this out of my ass ...]

Why it is not?
As also stated "Adding replay protection would make it easier to split those coins (indeed, it would cause everyone's coins to split into two pieces), *but it also makes the SegWit2x upgrade more likely to cause a lasting chain split. The SegWit2x goal is not to split the chain*, but to bring key stakeholders together to agree on SegWit".
The way they are approaching this is as forceful as it can get without using guns. Calling this choice is not really doing justice to this attack and distorting reality.

Very true -- and I don't disagree with their ethics. What they could do however is set the donation goal of the exchange listing fund to the amount required to get the coin listed on a top exchange and not limit the donation goal to the amount that the dev team considers reasonable.
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:09:07
On your *own* deciding what is good for Bitcoin and what isn't, is no different than what EV did with the NYA, where he and a select few had taken the position that S2X was *good* for Bitcoin.
If you really believe that a PoW change is an effective tactic to fight centralization then do you likewise believe that Vertcoin - we will always change PoW to fight centralization - isn't a scam coin and will succeed with this tactic to stay decentralized? 
And secondly, you can easily run this PoW experiment by releasing a fork of Bitcoin with your PoW changes. When you do, do you truly believe that the majority of Bitcoin users, developers, businesses, exchanges and miners will embrace this fork?
I don't think you can answer both questions with an affirmative yes.
My point being that whatever the change to Bitcoin is, if it is a consensus change then you need broad consensus. I do respect you though for your ongoing effort to bringing the centralization risk to our attention. It's definitely a huge risk to be wary of.

Notwithstanding that the "circumstantial evidence", as you call it, is already in the open and you're free to post as you wish, I think it is fundamentally wrong to call out people without concrete evidence.

*Several sovereign wealth funds and Asian investors have bought the bitch on a secret auction, which was a Deloitte consultant.*
**Bulgaria secretly sells battle for 3 billion euros**
*We are buying a new Air Force squadron*
The Finance Ministry has displaced 200,000 cops seized by the Prosecutor's Office after a successful operation against customs fraudsters. The transaction was secretly concluded at the most advantageous moment at the end of December 2017 and has brought to the budget 6 billion levs, which means that for one battle we have taken 15 000 euros.
This was reported by Vladislav Goranov to the Security Council at the Prime Minister, who was summoned for the Skripal case. The real topic, however, was what to do with this money. The idea of ​​buying squadrons of new aircraft for the army.
Several sovereign wealth funds and Asian investors have bought the bitch on a secret auction, which was a Deloitte consultant. Experts from the US FBI have helped to ensure the safety of the transactions that have been deferred over time, the latter being scheduled for the early hours of April 1, Goranov reported.
The reshuffle was necessary in order not to collapse the market with such a powerful one-off offering of battlefields, according to an expert from the CoinDesk site, to which Biovoly has consulted. From there, they checked the cryptographic statistics and confirmed that from now until now, an unknown operator had poured a little over 198,000 battleships. According to experts, this is one reason why the price of the crypto-wave drops slowly.
For the confiscated battlefield, it was understood that on May 29, 2017, the Southeast European Crime Counterfeiting Center (SELEC) announced on its official site the large-scale international operation PRAKTA / VIRUS, in which the Bulgarian authorities seized over 200,000 battleships. Subsequently, the Prosecutor's Office and the GDOC disowned it, but it was part of the conspiracy operation - the most successful in our service history.
According to Bivolov, Prime Minister Borisov will offer Sotir Tsatsarov, Vlady Goranov and himself for government awards.

I would hope for Coinbase delists Bcash and Brian Armstrong steps down as CEO; but my best guess is that it will be insignificant news: Coinbase will acquire earn.com ...

Kudos to CZ for being humble. It's one thing to throw a stupid idea out there; it's another to admit you were wrong and learn from it.
