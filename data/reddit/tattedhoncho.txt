50 Cent is a legend. Haha I’m glad he supports Bitcoin ��������������������������
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:54:58

@_date: 2017-12-01 12:54:21
Thank you sir! Means a lot your comment. Also would my iPhone be safe and secure having 2 wallets on it? 
New Bread wallet going to get now and my old original Bitcoin.com wallet? Want to keep my Bitcoin.com wallet too because I love seeing my old transactions receiving and sent information 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:43:44
Thanks brother!
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:16:01
Ya Crypto needs some work to done compared to a regular exchange with stocks! Crypto very new and improving daily.. Just give it sometime boss ;)
I’m trying to use Coinsquare too but patiently waiting on getting verified..!
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:13:54
LOVE IT
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:36:50
Don’t worry you’ll be fine man. Just have to wait for yours to get confirmed.. Should be few hours or up to days. Depends how congested the BTC server is!
Consequences are nothing. You’re gold. Worst consequence is you’ll receive your money back as a refund if it doesn’t confirm in the end but it will just be patient 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:01:00
Awesome story man. Glad you and your father are HODLers now. Cryptocurrency is definitely changing everyone’s lives and mine too! Love the positive effect Bitcoin and Crypto is doing to the world and giving back to the community :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:48:22
QuadrigaCX I just signed up for and Coinsquare.. Going to see which is better both look good. But more people use QuadrigaCX 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:00:40

@_date: 2017-12-28 21:34:07
Thanks so much brother! Helps bringing awareness to the Bitcoin community
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:38:25
How do I switch Legacy to Segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:36:00
That’s a good idea too!
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:38:31

Thanks brother appreciate your comment ;)
Enjoy your weekend and more life/blessings to you and your family!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:30:54
If I were to relogin my Ledger and click Segwit option instead of Legacy which I always click and is my main chain. What will happen?
Also brother how do I switch to Legacy to Segwit? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:47:12
100 facts! It already is ;)
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:44:34
Appreciate it man!

@_date: 2017-12-05 11:06:40
Sorry for your lost brother. I truly know how it feels to lose a loved one.. My deep condolences and thanks for posting. Takes a lot to post something so personal public online like that it takes a lot of courage. We as a community are all here for you man! You’re right they’re endless opportunities to still make money and life’s too short ❤️❤️❤️❤️
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:55:10
Looks like an amazing app brother! Is it safe and secure? Just making sure?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:59:56
Thanks a lot man! ����
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:05:43
Heard great things about Airbitz thanks a lot boss! Enjoy your day 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:17:01
Sounds good brother! It’ll be worth it when we get accepted!!! Bitcoin prices will be high and we can sell or just HODL :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:16:50
No wonder I knew it. Someone I know was rushing to buy BTC today thinking he’ll get 2X like the BTC/BCH hard fork in August!
I knew it was too good to be true and also that I would’ve heard more news and buzz about this LOW KEY hard fork that’s randomly happening today 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:00:08
Appreciate the comment boss man! ����
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:05:47
For sure I’m just using these hot wallets on my phone to carry a little to decent amount most. Hardware wallet is the way to go to secure your assets and bag ;)
Once again thank you boss man for your advise and help...!!! I love being safe than sorry and making SURE 100 times I’ll be safe/secure now. Since nowadays everyone is getting their coins stolen/hacked
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:39:30
Most new updated iOS and not jail broken :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:23:53
Will do! Thanks for the advise they’re a nice combo man
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:15:04
Nice! Thanks man. I just got Crypto Pro and I enjoy it with Blockfolio still. I’ll be sure to get Delta too haha! It doesn’t hurt to have more than 1 tool ;)
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:35:01
Amazing app! I’m an idiot everyday I was doing paper math calculating my daily totals everyday... This app makes life easier haha
I’m still learning and am a noob :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:29:50
Haha love this meme man! I’m a HUGE Tony Montana/Scarface die hard fan and Cryptocurrency is my life currently hahaha happy holidays!
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:23:51
Story of my life literally.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:50:21
Brother thanks so much! Been hearing great things about Bread.. TGIF enjoy boss 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:05:17
Blockfolio I love my friend! So glad I have it now. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:35:27
Delta free? Thanks bro
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:34:08
Just got approved for Coinsquare this morning and waiting on QuadrigaCX.. Which do you prefer boss?
I used to use localbitcoins lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:47:15
Tried it didn’t work brother! Doing the regular verification and it’s going to take a few business days. HODL all day though I’d just like to have an exchange account ready in case 
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:07:23
Sorry I meant how many different CRYPTOCURRENCIES it can carry max not Bitcoins. Do you know by any chance? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:00:51
Nothing. I love Blockfolio but I’ve heard GREAT things about Crypto Pro and Delta. Wanted to try it out to see if I’d like a change..
Crypto Pro is a paid apps though only downside but it’s still worth it lol. What’s $5? Cheap and worth the investment 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:06:39
Going to go for Crypto Pro! Heard amazing stuff about it... Also $5 won’t hurt for a great investment tool for Crypto ;)
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:51:20
Bitfinex or Binance? Which is a better overall exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:29:41
Amazing story brother. I’m glad you reached your moon and will be back soon... You’re right family and your mom will not always be here and will always be worth it. 100% pray for your mother for good health and wealth!
Happy Holidays and Merry Early Christmas brother!
More life and blessings on blessings.
God is always good!
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:36:42
Thanks boss means a lot!
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:00:29
Love the detailed comment brother! Enjoy your Sunday and blessings 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:31:36
HODL strong together brother. This is just a true test from the gods if we’re true HODLers or if we have weak hands ;)
All part of the Cryptoverse and if some people can’t handle dips like this it’s not for them!
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:52:08
Thanks boss! I was thinking that or Coinsquare!!! Coinsquare looks amazing and heard great things too currently waiting for verification..
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:38:12
Yes brother I have a Ledger Nano S! :)
I just use hot wallets on my iOS when I’m carrying some BTC and knowing I’m going to sell it or buy it from my Bitcoin cash in person dealer 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:18:56
Amazing answer Yoda ;)
Love your information and it was point on with details too! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:31:45
Amazing gift man! Merry Christmas
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:24:46
Bitcoin is currently $8,873 CAD dropped significantly the price haha. I’d say it’s the best time to load up and buy more BTC. Buy low and sell high or just HODL ����
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:37:46
Thank you for your help boss!!! Means a lot man �������� Enjoy your weekend and let’s make these profits!
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:19:49
Time will tell lol. I think BTC is going to stay strong and dominate the top still 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:45:47
Me too haha!!! I was going to buy in at $5,600 CAD and I waited.. Next day dropped to $4,000 CAD and I was happy I saved myself. After 1 week the $4,000 CAD turned into $7,000+ CAD.. Lmao then after 2 months I bought in at $9,000 CAD. Still win/win situation but I wish I just bought in at $5,600 CAD and HODL I would’ve been laughing even more lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:40:05
Did the same exact move! ��������
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:31:18
What’s the site I will check it out 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:03:57
Either move HODL or switching over to BTC right now is a win win situation! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:19:51
Avoid PayPal at all cost!!! You’ll get scammed by crooks if you’re selling BTC through PayPal. Try localbitcoins.com and sell them for cash in person meet ups or sell them for only money transfers and make sure they send you a picture with the bank receipt and it says NO REFUND to secure your transactions. Happy selling brother :) 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:02:30
To the moon now!!! ��������
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:02:17
Bitcoin.com Wallet. I usually pay the normal fee but today I want to get my transaction to be done ASAP within 10 minutes.. Should I change my fees to priority or urgent? I want it instant and asap the transfer. I remember on Friday I did a transaction and paid the normal fee and it took me 72 hours to finally receive my Bitcoin/confirm the transaction... Never want to go through that BS again :(
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:00:41
I feel the same exact way!!! Crypto and Bitcoin is changing my life in such a positive way it’s too good to be true. The gains/profits daily I’m making and we are making are surreal. I still can’t believe this is happening in my life and I feel as if it’s too good to be true it’ll all go away soon.. Hopefully me and you are just overthinking and this is the FUTURE like we believe it is. I pray to god this “too good to be true” phase goes away and it’s honestly just our reality and god wanted us to live out our dreams :) Guess time will tell but let’s get back to making this money and buying future lambos hahaa 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:44:29
Ordered my hardware wallet today! Excited on it coming... Also when I get my Ledger Nano S do I export my current bitcoin.com wallet to it or open a brand new wallet and just send Bitcoin over? Thanks it’ll mean a lot your input/experience brother!
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:38:00
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:05:18
HODL my friends. Watch today I have a feeling it’s going to SURGE big time after the Big Bang Theory Bitcoin episode airing tonight 12.6 million viewers ;)
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:21:32
Just stick to BTC and you’ll be fine. HODL that’s it 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:04:43
Keep on buying my friend!! Haha it’s a great time to buy low before it goes high again
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:31:51
I love your reply!!! I do agree with you it’s going to hit close to 10K by end of the year too.. I’m just going to HODL and stay strong! This dip ain’t nothing new... it’s just going to dip and then bounce back and hit a crazy all time high again 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:20:29
HODL only way to go! It’ll be worth it in the end ��������
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:35:02
Yessir! Like the way you think... Cryptosteel seems like an overpriced product. It’s $100+ USD dollars l o l. That’s literally same price as the Ledger Nano S or Trezor 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:12:04
100% facts! The Big Bang theory when it airs it will cause millions of people in fact to know about the King of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Amazing exposure which means value will rise up guarantee ��
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:46:36
Got the money out of PayPal already. It’s being transferred to my bank account 3-5 business days it should be in my account paypal said 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:56:20
Lmao think the storm will raise the BTC prices or drop/dip again?
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:44:10
LOVE IT!!! Haha 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:45:54
It’s out of my paypal account now and being transferred said 3-5 business days 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:16:43
Time now is to HODL or HODL and buy more BTC when it’s dipping like this. Get a discount on BTC today haha
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:31:00
Can you explain with detail how to use an accelerator? Thanks will mean a lot boss ����
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:42:41
HODL all day everyday. HODL is a longterm gains/profits and almost a sure thing depends what you HODL. Trading you can lose... Both will make you profits but
HODLing = long term gains/profits and big pay off
Trading = short term quick gains/profits and you might lose trading it’s not a sure thing. HODLing you have a higher success rate 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:46:47
Always start brand new wallet for 100% security purposes and to be safe. Ledger just start brand new and don’t import and just send yourself the BTC
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:55:42
21 SAVAGE LOL. I just took in what you did there haha
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:45:32
Thanks a lot for your help man! Also usually when I’m receiving/waiting on a Bitcoin to get sent to me it’ll show up on my wallet almost instantly or within 10-15 mins.. It’s been 48 hours + and my wallet doesn’t say I’m receiving anything? This is normal and due to the congestion right? I just want my wallet to say it’s receiving my Bitcoin to reassure I’ll actually get my money and it’s not lost lol
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:02:48
I like the price it is of BTC right now but of course I want it to go up but slow and steady wins the race this weekend? This weekend was not a rollercoaster I expected 
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:55:32
Thank you!!! Now I understand it fully means a lot man ��������
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:44:58
100 % facts you stated ��������
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:18:06
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:24:33
Yup. Bought around $7,300-$7,500 range
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:15:05
No Bitcoin Cash will not be the new Bitcoin. BITCOIN IS THE ORIGINAL DON AND WILL STAY ON TOP FOREVER. To the moon! Haha facts 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:45:31
I already withdrawal the money to my bank account it’s out 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:43:22
Yeah my friend warned me and now I’m tripping balls. Am I good to go or I got scammed?!
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:13:14
Blessings and more life! ��������
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:12:04
We’ve been hitting all time highs this past week and very often though hopefully it doesn’t go away the trend 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:23:37
I was literally in the same position all day today debating if I should sell now at the ATH price make quick/easy profits aka short term gains/profit... Took me a couple hours to make the decision to HODL. Why gamble/trade for that QUICK easy profit? Quick and easy money can easily backfire.. My plan was to sell at an ATH price profit and keep that money on the side fiat I’m pretty sure that’s the term and buy in when it dips so profit even more. Buy low and sell high right?! But speaking to multiple people, experienced, and my mentors best thing for us to do is HODL
HODLing will benefit us in every way and there is no losing. We will just let our investment appreciate and be laughing to the bank in due time. Why risk our position in power and try to time the market for a dip when we never really know when that will happen right? The dip can be nothing too lmao. HODL brother together and let’s get this money ;)
It took me so many hours btw to make my decision to HODL too. I was so tempted to sell haha
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:17:33
Scams. Don’t fall for it.. Too good to be true they’ll trick you those scammers/fraud con artist. I got scammed on localbitcoin.com similar situation but a PayPal chargeback and lost $440. Could be worse thank god I learned my lesson! Watch out for those guys beware and cautious. No PayPal stay AWAY! Be safe my friend :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:12:10
Where’s the accelerator interface? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:38:36
Also hopefully within next week Bitcoin jumps pass the $10,000 all time high mark! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:03:04
100%!!! Haha brother so funny you said casino statement. I use to be a gambler too and BURN thousands to f’ing dumb casino/gambling the devil created that.. Now I stumbled upon Crypto and never been happier! Instead of blowing $1,000 on Roulette I now blow it on Bitcoin or ALT coins and make real money ;) aka casino I always lose and keep going lol. I win only like 3/10 times but it’s addicting. F the devils playground (casino) and let’s get this money in Crypto!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:13:13
To the moon brother!!!! ����������
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:59:27
LETS GOOOOO! ��������
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:41:38
Good choice on the Ledger Nano S! I’m receiving mine this week and can’t wait haha :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:56:21
Perfect thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:20:25
For sure. Thanks man!!!! HODL is the way to go 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:07:01
Amazing time to buy! Buy ASAP and take advantage of the dip
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:22:38
Well said! Preach. All facts you stated! ����
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:52:25
Good post!! Love how we basically hit 10K SO early. It was predicted to hit by Christmas/New Years and it’s still end of November.. I think it’ll hit 12-13K by 2018 around that time 
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:22:59
They send you the money for the Bitcoin and then after a bit chargeback and get their money back. While you sent the Bitcoin and when you send it it’s gone forever. PayPal payments can be easily reversed screwing us the Bitcoin sellers over.. It happened to me last week. I sold some Bitcoin through PayPal and got scammed for around $450 bucks.. Learned my lesson and for $450 I’m never getting scammed again or going to BS PayPal 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:11:18
Thanks and for sure! But is it normal that my wallet says I’m not receiving anything? Usually even when I’m waiting for an BTC and confirmation it shows up on my wallet as receiving.. This time it doesn’t say anything at all? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:15:42
Every. Single. Night. I do the same brother!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:26:30
Usually when Bitcoin dips or dips severely and take huge hits it always makes it way back to the top and break barriers though. Over the past and history that always happened. Dips or even severely big ones make Bitcoin come back stronger than ever... Minor setbacks for major comebacks! Well that’s just my opinion and facts it happened one too many times. Remember last 2 weeks ago Bitcoin dropped around 15% range I forgot the % value it dropped to be exact but that’s an estimate.. It dropped significantly and look at us now! HODL baby all day everyday. Some people lose because they think they’re smarter than the market and they think they can time it properly which is false lol. No one can time the market it’s just all speculations 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:41:57
Thank you guys! I was wondering same thing if I lost my money aka Bitcoin!!! Been well over 48 hours + and still unconfirmed.. Also my wallet doesn’t even saying I’m receiving anything at all I was worried a bit but I have my block chain info so I should be good?
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:01:46
Thank you everyone for commenting and helping!!! LESSON LEARNED F PAYPAL. In total I got scammed $432.54 could’ve been worse.. I could’ve lost $2,500 in total. $432.54 I can take as a loss.. Hopefully Bitcoin goes super high and I’ll profit and recover my scam/recent lost 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:04:06
Yessir. Do it up man. Go hard or go home that’s the way to go and say I lvie my life. They say the best time to buy is yesterday. So the best time to buy is NOW. Which is completely facts. Just HODL and you’ll be just fine boss
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:47:47
Omg hopefully I didn’t get scammed I’m a noob fml. I already received the money in my paypal and withdrawal out of my paypal to my bank already now I need to wait 3-5 days hopefully I’m in the clear. His account on localbitcoins is 100% and 6 successful transfers and 3 good comments 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:21:11
The drop is pretty damn crazy right now. I pray to god we bounce back hard and hit an all time high and stay strong...
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:51:04
I used Paybis.com to buy with my credit card. Love doing business with them. Smooth and fairly fast.. Depends on how the days going how quick you’ll receive your Bitcoin. I recommend them! Used several times and never 1 complaint! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:23:40
I’d say be patient and wait it out to see if you can save money for a dip... Try to see what happens this week or you can just buy now. They always say the best time to buy is yesterday so the best time to buy is now. Either way if you buy now or later when you dip it’s a win/win situation if you HODL 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:22:47
Wow glad you got it back! That’s really scary I’d be tripping balls and stressed
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:08:54
Paybis.com used a couple times to buy Bitcoin with credit card! Smooth, secure, and great business with them. I’d recommend them and they have great customer service! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:56:42
Thank you man!!! Appreciate it and needed the reassurance. I love using it too and been using it for a while. Some “people” are claiming bitcoin.com is a scam and a fake and not to use it.. Lol I think most likely trolls or Roger Ver haters 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:00:08
A++++ ;)
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:43:24
Thank you! I’m having a problem with it though.. Right now for the last few hours it only shows how much BTC I have and not the total in my CAD currency it use to show. Do you know why it’s not showing up the total currency in CAD anymore? Also I had to post that to make sure lol. I had some trolls saying bitcoin.com is a scam and don’t use it when I’ve been using it for a while now and perfectly fine and happy with it :-)
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:29:35
I have a strong feeling give it time but it will go back to $7,800+ and hit an all time high in due time. I’m a believer

Amazing! I kept my BTC and HODL strong. But on last Friday I bought in early and bought around 1.6 worth of BCH when BCH was only $1,000 CAD and I cashed out when it turned into $1,450 CAD a share and made a quick easy profit of $1,000. Then I put all my BCH + extra $1,000 profit into BTC again when it was very low and been happy and winning ever since :) BTC IS THE WAY TO GO

Hopefully not another crazy weekend... Last weekend was crazy enough! Lmao ����

Yessir you’re right! Paybis surely does charge HIGH fees commission and extra for credit card. But it was my first time buying I didn’t mind paying those premium prices and I was a noob before lmao. I don’t mind paying high prices AS long as I receive my Bitcoin or money safe and secure. Also fast/reasonable time I don’t mind paying high fees. After that though I never bought Bitcoin from places that charge high fees and used localbitcoins.com and did in person cash deals. Really did save a lot!!! And with the fees and commission in the beginning I probably almost spent $2,000 man.. It’s all good though that learning experience taught me a lot and I just made my profits cover those fees ;) It takes money to make money remember that.

Thanks a lot man!!! Appreciate the input 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:47:45
Scam. Don’t fall for it or take the risk! It’s already a red flag from the person asking for 2 separate payments of $1,500 each.. Be careful brother ����
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:39:43
I’m in the same position right now lol. Not sure if I should sell at the ATH or HODL... VERY VERY hard decision to make brother haha. Either route is a win/win situation but the other route will make us richer ;)
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:32:01
I’m in the same situation brother!
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:13:55
Never fall for market manipulation, FUD or FOMO. Always HODL and stay strong my friend 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:45:17
What site do you use to buy your BTC? I use credit card as my payment methods btw 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:00:07
LETS GET IT!!! BTC to the moon while BCH crashes ������
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:32:16
I’m in a alike situation... Been over 48 hours+ and still zero 0 confirmations!! I’m chilling because I know the huge congestion but same time a bit worried that I won’t receive my Bitcoin :’(
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:52:51
100% Bitcoin will always be  and always going to get stronger as time goes by. I can’t imagine how big the future is for Bitcoin... ��
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:36:12
I’m Canadian too!!! Cheers brother. Road to $13,000 now and the moon ;)
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:33:52
Debating if I should convert all my Ethereum to BCH?! Or should I just HODL my ETH 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:57:43
Bitcoin will always stay strong and give it a few days to weeks we’ll hit ATHs again!! And break records 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:26:32
Ledger Nano S! I just ordered mine and I was debating which I should choose too. Did my research and everyone is saying Ledger is the way to go! I think both are great and it’s a win/win situation either one you choose though :) 
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:29:07
You think BCH is a good investment/move and also do you think it’s a good time to buy in on BCH right now to profit?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:54:23
Yup!! Does your wallet say you’re receiving anything or nothing at all like me? Hopefully in a few hours we’ll receive our coin. I should’ve just kept my BCH and I would’ve not been in this waiting game problem.. I converted my BCH profits and put it in more BTC since I can load up! Game plan is hopefully BTC makes a strong comeback again and hits at ATH ����
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:59:41
HODLing is the way to go brother!!! HODL and stay strong it’ll be worth it in the end 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:42:53
I was wondering the same exact thing!!! Feels like forever waiting on my transaction to get confirmed.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:04:59
Mines been 24 hours no confirmation yet too. Also I’m worried because on my wallet it doesn’t say I’m receiving anything... Hopefully it’s just the congestion 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:12:44
Appreciate it man! Means a lot 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:15:05
bitcoin.com wallet! Been using it for a while and love it! No problems with it so far... ������������
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:28:30
100%! Right. HODL and it doesn’t matter if you buy now or during a dip. Either way you win if you HODL 
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:02:13
Perfect thanks boss! Your tip/advise really did save me from any future trouble.. Will do it when I receive my Ledger Nano S this week ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:02:38
Facts. HODL and don’t sell. We won’t lose anything if you don’t sell!!!! 100% love it 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:33:58
Thanks will take your advise means a lot! Your input is great man... Enjoy your weekend boss
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:08:28
Nano S it is!!! Haha I’m excited thanks brother 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:33:15
Thanks will take your advise means a lot!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:30:07
Also is it easy to import your current wallet into the Ledger Nano S? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:03:28
Do you think Roger is really with BTC or BCH then? Hard to tell sometimes lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:54:44
Cheers my Canadian brother! Hopefully we all get rich.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:41:15
You’re right.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:32:15
I bought around $9,000 range CAD! Haha been laughing to the bank ever since brother 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:12:52
You think I should choose to pay the normal fee? Or priority or urgent? I use bitcoin.com wallet
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:44:42
I pray to god too. I already have the money withdrawal to my bank account already.. 3-5 business days but not sure if I’ll receive it. PayPal said it should be in my account 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:46:50
You’re 100% right!!!!! HODL and stay strong.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:57:01
Yup. All the ALT coins doing good and stable this weekend too.. Only thing going down is BCH lmao!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:08:08
Dope! Thanks appreciate your comment. Ordering mine today and excited lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:26:42
Is etransfer a safe way to receive my money securely and no scams? Electronic bank transfer 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:41:11
Thank you! Going to buy.. Needed some advise and was always waiting for a good dip and now is the perfect time! Do you plan on buying now too for this dip happening right now? I just hate paying high fees buying Bitcoin only bad part and the whole verify processing part.. Takes some time to actually receive your BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:31:52
We will never know my friend! Haha all we can do is speculate... I’d like to know when the next dip is too so I can load up more too! But also I love how it keeps rising :) 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:53:37
I’m in the same position! Yesterday I converted my BCH to BTC on shapeshift and they completed the conversion. They said they sent me the Bitcoin and it’s been over 24 hours and my wallet doesn’t even say that I’m receiving anything!!!! I’m pretty sure it’s the congestion going on and we’re part of the 100,000+ unconfirmed transactions in the mempool waiting to get confirmed. You’re not in this alone and waiting on your coin brother! ��������
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:09:14
I like your positive/optimistic mindset!!
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:26:15
Hopefully!!! I pray to god it hits 10K and keeps going to the moon my friends. ����������
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:18:59
I can’t wait for mine to come in ordering it today!!!
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:04:16
Thank you so much man!!! Too many trolls screwing around and trying to say bitcoin.com is a scam and not a trusted wallet. When I’ve been using it for few weeks now and love it. No problems so far and it works mint! But do you know why my total balance in CAD currency isn’t showing anymore like it use to? It only shows my BTC not my BTC converted to my total CAD currency. It usually shows my BTC and then my BTC in CAD currency total 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:58:42
HODL is the way to go right now only.. We can’t even move anything there’s 100,000+ unconfirmed transactions and I’m 1 of them waiting to receive my BTC!
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:17:30
Amazing post man! HODL and stay strong. It’ll be worth it in the end for all of us HODLing ����������������
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:18:43
Thanks brother!!! And what’s the official website? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:45:45
I’d do it brother! You have an amazing opportunity.. High risks high reward but I’m a Bitcoin believer and I think we as a community got this! Each of us will touch our own moons ����⛽️����
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:14:07
HODL and thank me later brother!
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:00:59
Thanks for your advise man! Appreciate it 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:47:50
Happy holidays! What an extreme nice gesture and will pay it forward! You do good good will come back to you.. Karma beauty of life ������������
