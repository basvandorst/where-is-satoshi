Hey, you’re not allowed to say good things about central banking. That’s heresy in this sub
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:32:20
The thing is, you invest in something like a stock because it has inherent value. When you buy stock in a company, you're investing in something that produces a good or service. You give money to a company under the assumption that the money is invested in product production which will generate some return on investment. A stock price goes up when the company does well and goes down when a company does poorly. When boeing sells more airplanes than they thought they would in a quarter, their company is more valuable so the value of a stock goes up. 
With bitcoin, the price is going up simply because the price is going up. Everyone I know who has bought bitcoin is going with the logic of "Wow, it was like 9k a few weeks ago and now its 16k. I could make so much money on this." There's no actual value in it. The intrinsic value of a bitcoin (it's use as a currency) is basically in the toilet because no one wants to use something so unstable for normal transactions. The price seems to completely unresponsive to anything that *should* be detracting from it's value of a currency. It's like the textbook definition of a bubble. Eventually, everyone that wants to buy in buys in and the price stabilizes. Once the price stops increasing, everyone looking for a quick buck with no actual interest in using bitcoin as a currency sells it. The value drops which makes more people want to get rid of it in a nasty feedback loop that makes it worthless almost overnight. So yes, treat it as what it actually is: a gambling game on when the bubble bursts.

That's generally indicative of a problem with you, not a problem with every single person who disagrees. It sounds like you have a serious inability to understand and empathize with opposing views. 
You're also going to drive off a lot of people with this hard-headed mindset. Personally, I do know how bitcoin works. I did a lot of research and I came to the conclusion that it was  pretty stupid.

Shorting isn’t a magic money machine when prices go down. You still only stand to make the difference between price you initiated and price you bought back minus capital gains tax. I don’t think the average person is willing to short more than a few thousand dollars because of associated risks. With that in mind, you really don’t stand to gain all that much from a short unless you are 100% certain the price is going to plummet.

Calculus isn't stupid because it is a useful tool that improved upon previous tools for studying the world. It's usefulness doesn't arise from it's internally consistent set of rules. That's just a prerequisite for it to be a tool. Simply meeting that prerequisite isn't what makes it useful.

@_date: 2018-03-29 16:25:23


Disagree. I think most people are generally ignorant about the benefits of inflation. It’s easy and intuitive to immediately take the view of “money loses value over time = bad thing”. Problem is that reality is often counterintuitive. So people would still jump on the bitcoin train chasing ill-conceived dreams of a “perfect currency” that wont behave how they think it will behave. These ”ignorant dreamers” will give the coin some popularity.
In addition, you have many people completely disintetested in it as a widely adopted currency. They are useful in illegal transactions (Arguably what sparked the current popularity). Also, many people are just investing in them in the hopes that the value continues to rise. Most people are trying to make money off of it, so they dont care about its use as currency. Combined, these groups can give the coin significant populatity despite its major flaw of being deflationary.
In a vacuum, inflation would disrupt a dollars ability to be a “store of value”. However, we aren’t all chucking dollars under our mattress every payday. You want money to spend today? Put it in your wallet, it will keep its value for a day. Use it in the next few months or years? Checking and savings will have interest rates that match inflation to maintain the value of your dollar. You can throw money into retirement accounts for some tax advantaged storage of value. 
The point is this, our system has recognized that inflation could create issues with money acting as a store of value. We have created systems to completely mitigate these effects. What has bitcoin done to mitigate its harmful and inevitable deflationary tendencies? What possibly *could* be done since it’s inherently unregulated?

@_date: 2018-03-29 12:45:40
They’re a big reason for inflation because they *choose* to inflate the currency. Inflation is good. It’s not some negative side effect of a central banking system. A small amount of inflation encourages spending without harming the consumer. Deflation is actually terrible because consumers make money by simply holding onto it which destroys spending and investment (the things that actually drive an economy). 
Centralization doesn’t exist because the powers that be want to control you. Centralized banking exists because modern economies would collapse without it. It’s not without problems... but tearing it down and replacing it with some bullshit currency that addresses none of the money supply problems doesn’t help anyone.

Oh sorry, I didn’t mean to say I was downvoting you. I was sarcastically encouraging everyone to downvote me. 
And yeah, I understand how inflation works. It gets magnified over large time scales. But are you keeping cash in your wallet for decades? Hopefully not. There are systems that allow you to safely store your money in accounts for short, long, or extremely long periods of time so that you don’t lose money to inflation.  The money you keep in short term form should be getting spent in the short term. 
Also, your argument for a stable bitcoin is fallacious and based on the idea that an economy never grows. Imagine the hypothetical economy of clockworks. Everyone buys and sells only clocks. One year, clock factories produce and sell 10,000 clocks and everyone has 10,000 dollars. So clocks and dollars can be exchanged giving the dollar value. But next year, 20,000 clocks are produced but there is still only 10,000 dollars. So each dollar can now buy double the number of clocks. At a constant supply, the value of a dollar has deflated. 
Now, a bunch of clever clockworkians realize “hey, the economy does this every year. Why would I buy 2 clocks this year when I can buy 4 clocks next year?” And so they do that. The decreased spending reduces revenue for clock factories who are subsequently unable to increase their production at the same rate. The economy is now worse off because of the deflationary nature of a static money supply.

I’m not sure what exactly your point was at the end with Tesla coins and stuff. But I think I get the gist. You’re saying “In the long term, economies will stop growing because we will reach a limit energy production. Therefore, a constant money supply can function in the present day”. Your argument is predicated on three flawed assumptions
1) Economies only grow through increased energy production. (Automation, materials, innovation, computation, etc. are not necessarily correlated to increased energy production. Simplified: energy required go build a widget doesn’t remain constant)
2) We are anywhere close to the limit of solar energy harvest. (Far from it)
3) We do not pursue any means of energy production beyond ground based  solar harvesting (nuclear And  space based solar could be widely expanded before we reach the solar limit)
You’re talking about extremely long time scales that may never come. I don’t want to live with an economy in the toilet for centuries because it might eventually work if economies stop growing. So to answer your question 


Yes. Until someone can point out how it will not cause short term and chronic catastrophe, I want an inflationary currency.

Monopoly is designed to be a fixed maximum economic size so that players eventually lose. The end game is zero sum. Real economies aren’t like that. Monopoly has fixed prices so someone printing money could actually have an advantage. Real economies aren’t like that. Cheating person in monopoly is trying to make money for themselves. Real federal reserve is targeting an inflation rate for a healthy currency. Total player net worth grows linearly and fairly insignificantly. Real economies grow exponentially. There are a lot more differences but I feel like these fit most in the context that you’ve framed.

@_date: 2018-04-10 22:46:07
This question was already asked in this thread. You can refer to that answer. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:42:12
To start, I consider success as widespread adoption of bitcoin as a primary currency. That seems to be the general goal of people on this subreddit.
Right, so first let's look at what monetary policy is. At a very high level, it's controlling the supply of money so that prices are stable in a dynamic economy. This is actually done indirectly through securities markets, setting a banking reserve requirement, and lending money to banks. You can look these up on your own if you don't know what they are. If you don't feel like it, monetary policy = managing money supply.
There is plenty of historical precedent for caring about monetary policy. Poor decisions have been disastrous for economies in the past. Most infamous is the Zimbabwean dollar, where the money supply was increased at a rate where economic growth was not keeping up. Hyperinflation ensues because of this mismanagement and the Zimbabwean dollar becomes worthless. Poor decisions can also lead to the flipside, a deflationary currency. Also historically scary stuff. Deflationary policies have been known to exacerbate depressions, inhibit growth, and lower investments spending. The great depression was partly a deflationary spiral where debt causes deflation which leads to increased debt which leads to increased deflation. So since either side of the coin is clearly not desirable, the organization in charge of monetary policy must seek to strike a middle ground. It has been shown that a small amount of inflation is good for an economy so that's the Fed targets an inflation rate and shapes monetary policy around that. 
So, if fiat currency maintains stable prices and stimulates growth through careful manipulation of monetary policy, how does bitcoin approach monetary policy? Well, bitcoin essentially poses the question "What if we just didn't try?" No centralized management, anyone can participate in making their own money, and once the cap is reached, money supply is never touched again. Knowing that monetary policy requires such a delicate hand to produce a stable currency, our intuition tells us that this is lunacy. But hey, we really shouldn't dismiss it just because it sounds absolutely terrible. We should dismiss it because it actually is just as terrible as it sounds. 
The effects are essentially equivalent to the Fed taking a hardline contractionary monetary policy. Deflation spirals out of control, real value of debts are increased, depression inhibits or reverses economic growth, and unemployment skyrockets. The worst part is that there's nothing anyone can do about it. There's no central body to say "hey, things are bad. Let's make them not bad anymore". Bitcoin commits to not trying to have a monetary policy. So, if it were widely adopted, we'd be forced to just watch it crash and burn. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:48:14
Why are we explaining this to a 5 year old? What has Johnny added to the metaphor? Why are we explaining this to a child. Why is there even a metaphor in the first place? Inflation isn’t really a complex topic that needs a metaphor and the metaphor didn’t actually add anything to the explanation. 
Why have you typed this out???
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:04:56


Sure. Thats how growing capitalistic economies work. Its a simplified view, but alright. Whats the system that you want to replace it with?


Why? What good comes of that? I get that it *feels* better if a bank holds all its liabilities all the time. But it needs some actual hard benefits before we would adopt something like this. Would it improve growth? No. Would it decrease unemployment? No. It would be effectively equivalent to the federal reserve setting a reserve requirement of 100%. To give you an idea of how drastic that is, that’s a 90% increase from its current value. The closest we’ve ever been to being so extreme was raising the requirement by 50% in the ‘30s which exacerbated the Great Depression. 


So now we’re fighting poor monetary policy with fiscal policy. Ok. We’re going to cut taxes to incentivize spending. In a normal ecomomy, you can cut taxes and this will increase spending. Issue here is that the US government isn’t able to accrue debt like normal because we arent allowed to borrow out of thin air anymore. So they need to cut spending at an equivalent rate which is going to slow growth. Also, you’ve got a ton of unintended consequences falling out o this. First, you’re actually creating the opposite effect of what you want. Lets say you want to invest 10 dollars and you get a tax discount of 10% of your purchase. You could make that investment and get a 1 dollar tax break. Or you could wait a year, have the capacity to spend 12 dollars and get a 1.2 dollar tax break. You havent fixed the problem, youve exacerbated it. Second, by creating a bracketed system where people that spend *more* get a *higher* tax rate, you’re essentially creating a regressive tax which is just horrible by any standards. 
Also, again, the issue with “let’s just try it” is that bitcoin offers no out. There’s no way to see signs of failure and attempt any sort of correction. Nobody can touch monetary policy with bitcoin; its one of its “””features”””. It’s literally the “let’s not try monetary policy” of currencies. 


Ok yeah. Some people are fucking morons. These people aren’t significantly affecting the economy. Just because most people drooled their way through high school civics doesn’t mean that investors, businesses, and people that actually affect economic growth aren’t affected by it. Joe Shmo might not  consciously choose to by more hot dogs one year to the next. But a million Joe Shmos are going to statistically buy more when Oscar Meyer invests in a manufacturing process that makes hot dog production cheaper. 
Also, the nice thing about banks is that you aren’t losing a significant amount of purchasing power every year. Banks offer interest rates on savings. So yeah, if you’re dumb and you hold all your money in your wallet, you’re losing money. Otherwise, you’re fine. 


Boy howdy. I didn’t know if i should address this as a legitimate argument or ignore it. But I’ll address it. You can’t just say “in the end, it doesn’t matter because it’s cool”. What doesn’t matter? Economic stability doesnt matter? People living in poverty doesn’t matter? Modern standards of living don’t matter?  Also, what do you mean by “bitcoin is the first currency you can own and control”? You can’t control anything related to bitcoin supply. You can control how you spend it, but you can do that with USD. What makes it more controllable than any other currency?

I’ve been surprised at how well the community takes it. Some of you have a garbage understanding of economics, but you’re at least open to hearing about it. Generally, I stay in the positive amount of upvotes. 
But idk, maybe it’s all federal reserve agents keeping my comments in the green lol

There are a lot of posts in this sub that ride a fine line between satire and earnest idiocy. Of all those posts, you’re riding it the hardest. And I fucking love it

The entire thought process of many bitcoin proponents is pretty delusional. So yeah, that makes sense

Yeah. Ok. And the price of one Zimbabwe dollar is always equal to the price of one Zimbabwe dollar. That’s not how any of this works when you’re looking at the volatility of something. 
If you don’t like comparing it to fiat, compare it against a standard basket of goods. If you think it’s inherently not volatile because of some dumb tautology, you’re looney

I critically evaluate it as false. Governments aren’t all powerful and all knowing as evidenced by the multitude of things they can’t do or know. Since this statement is obviously false and retarded, I’m going to move on with my life completely unaffected by it. 
Ya know, how a normal person responds when confronted with absurd information.

No. That’s not how any of this works.
This is an inconsequential pandering speech and everyone there knows it. It’s some joke UKIP guy shouting about how fractional reserve banking is theft and monetary policy is counterfeiting. Nobody is taking it seriously. He probably doesn’t even mean it fully. It’s just a nice little talk to go into a 2 minute video that he can point to when talking to his base and say “see? I’m tough on bankers!” as if that means anything. 
If nobody cares, why would anyone bother wasting time correcting him? He’s doing no harm. Just let him say his piece and move on the something serious.

But it does mean actually mean something. Imagine country A makes 500b a year and country B makes 500b a year. A widget factory costs 100b to build. So they can build 5 widget factories. But if they each borrow 500b from each other, they can build 10 widget factories and global debt goes up by 1t. In subsequent years, they will produce much more than 500b due to the increased widget production. But it’s not just creating money out of no where, they need to make payments with interest on the loan. But the growth from widget factories outweighs the interest on the loan. The global economy looks very different with a world debt of 1t compared to no lending at all. 
Also, refusing to pay back a loan would be disastrous. You essentially have an established credit which is why you’re trusted to be loaned money. If you refuse to pay, nobody will lend you money and you won’t be able to grow at the same rate. You’ll be left in the dust while other economies prosper. No rational player would choose to do this.

This question was already asked in this thread. You can refer to that answer.

Sure thing. If somehow, deflationary issues get handwaved away, nobody ever needs to finance anything again, and all war ceases, I’ll think of you. That absolutely seems 100 percent plausible 
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:02:50
Eh, I don’t really think about the “cool” factor of the tech. Cell phones didn’t become popular because of amazing advancements in microprocessors. They became popular because they were useful to people. 
Also, I don’t think anyone is making the argument that deflation is bad because we currently have inflation. That would be a fallacy. Arguments about deflation tend to be focused more on the economic consequences of that.

I’m not saying he shouldn’t have a voice. He’s got a voice and he’s using it. That doesn’t mean I need to take him seriously. 
Secondly, many people make cogent arguments for centralized banking. You might want to listen to them sometime. It’s not very intellectually stimulating to only listen to people you agree with. So I highly doubt no one there was able to come up with a rebuttal. 
Also, not a tori and I don’t plan on leaving. If you don’t want my contribution to the discussion, don’t respond. I do find it ironic that you’re simultaneously telling me to leave this discussion while exalting him for daring to say his piece.

The part where you pretended that monopoly is anything like a real economy and that the fed just prints money to buy properties. Could you outline just what analogies you were trying to make with your example? 
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:51:18
No, benefit is never equally distributed by any kind of policy and nailing down what "equal" means brings up a debate of metrics which is ultimately subjective.

Hooo boy. We’re just gonna gloss over the usefulness as if it’s nothing? You can’t just say “X isn’t useful. It’s only use is Y”. If it has a use, it’s useful.

Itself. You see, the world is actually comprised of billions of entities all participating in a global economy. You and I are part of those entities. So if I lend you 100 dollars, the world debt has increased by 100 dollars. Even though I’m lending you money, I don’t have negative debt. 
Idk, I feel like this is a really simple concept. But this question of “who is the world in debt to” always comes up when someone mentions global debt. I’m not sure if it’s laziness to do even basic research or if it’s from a genuine place of misunderstanding.

That... doesn’t answer the question though? 
“How does society function without a government?” well you see, 150 years ago we freed the slaves. That turned out alright so I’m guessing total anarchy would be pretty cool too

I want you to reread what you just wrote. Now understand that you have no conception of how people judge scams. 
If people understood that my MLM is just selling products with a hierarchy of employees like target or amazon, they wouldn’t dismiss it as a scam so easily.

Does your family not understand how graphs work? Or is it just you?
