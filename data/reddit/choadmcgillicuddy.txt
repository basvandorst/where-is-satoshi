4% fee from what I can determine.

Give a woman a bitcoin and she eats for a day.  Teach her to bitcoin and she eats in her new kitchen.  Or something like that.

Use Coinbase Pro.
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:58:19
Separate.  Use coinbase for fiat deposits and pro for trading.
@_date: 2019-07-16 01:00:50
After taxes maybe?

Use Coinbase to deposit cash, but transfer to Coinbase Pro to buy/sell/transfer out.  You'll save a bunch in fees.  If you have a Coinbase account, it's the same login creds for Pro.
Don't keep any long term holds there though.  Transfer to a hardware wallet.

Use Coinbase Pro.  Same login credentials as regular, but much lower fees.
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:51:01
Consider a hardware wallet too.  I use the Ledger Nano X.
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:06:38
Coinbase Pro

I use Coinbase Pro.  Super easy to use.

Not an app...
Works fine on phone.

I meant the transfer of fiat from coinbase to coinbase pro is instant.  Sorry if I misunderstood the question.
@_date: 2019-07-04 23:47:22
Not an upgrade as much as a different platform.  It's a no brainer to use pro over regular Coinbase.  No cost and cheaper.

Market says, "I'll pay whatever it costs"
Limit says, "I'll pay no more than x amount"

You and 20 million other people loan me a few hundred sats.  I pay you and 20 million other people a few sats interest.

You could even use the lowest price for the year if you know what year you bought it.  IRS shouldn't argue with that and at long term gains rates (assuming USA), you won't pay more than 20% of your gain and could pay zero..  Depending on your tax bracket, you might want to sell some this year and some next year, especially if it will keep you in the zero cap gains bracket.
 
**Long Term Capital Gains Tax Brackets**
**Tax Bracket/Rate**
Here are the cap gains rates based on income:
|Cap Gains Rate|Single|Married Filing Jointly|Head of Household|
|0%|$0-$39,375|  $0 - $78,750|  $0 - $52,750|
|  15%|  $39,376 - $434,550|  $78,751 - $488,850|  $52,751 - $461,700|
|  20%|  $434,551+|  $488,851+|  $461,701+  |

Assuming the btc buy fees don't eat the rewards up.

You can disable 2fa on the exchange and once you have the new phone, re-enable it.

I use Pei.  Easy money.  I cash out in BTC.

Weird.  I was just able to sign up without using your link.
@_date: 2019-08-23 03:28:13
I dunno.  Quickest to withdraw wins?
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:10:07
Might as well get whatever rewards it offers.  Just pay in full each month.  I get 1% cash back.  I run everything through my card.
@_date: 2019-10-08 15:58:25
I found the same type of thing.  Turned out to be some Coinbase code I was instructed to keep safe.  Still don't know why I need it.
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:22:10
Bitcoin can divide 100 million times to one Satoshi.  Just ignore decimal places.  It would be like saying a 100 million dollar bill would end up being worthless because it is worth too much.

Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done.  It's an old scam that people are still falling for.

Back when Bitcoin is on the rise.  Probably buy back in around 11-12k.

Thanks!  Not there and no blockchain keystore in the Samsung store.  If I search the phone, I find it, but cant get to it.
