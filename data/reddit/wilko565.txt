I get where you're coming from, and in time it 'should' be used more. Like if you go on holiday you compare prices back to your home currency to see how much they cost. But Bitcoin is too unstable and therefore at current cannot be used as a unit of account - a basic and required function of money
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:07:19
That's the point though. In a worst case scenario you see the true value of something. Like how cigarettes and coffee are seen as currency in movies... Because they have use in themselves

This is my opinion and I expect it to be one that isn't overly liked, but if I can't share on reddit then things have really gone down the toilet.
I believe Roger Ver is, as I believe, trying to progress currencies in general. The number of people I've seen in this forum who support bitcoin for the sole reason that it goes up in value is crazy. Crypto's were never about making money (well directly anyway). They were about allowing two people anywhere to exchange wealth instantly. There are so many other currencies much better at doing this than bitcoin, in fact bitcoin would be one of my last choices due to slow transactions and high fees. look at IOTA, with almost instant transactions and no fees... Surely that's better, plus more scalable and more sustainable to run. I believe that bitcoin is in a bubble and  Mr Ver is trying to jump ships to what he believes will take its place when it finally pops.
I look forward to discussing my opinion

You realize Bitcoin can be burnt (effectively destroyed)  right? It's far from indestructible. I'm not sure you've done your homework here... And there's nothing against that, I just don't like false claims about intrinsic value in the crypto space...
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:11:44
Ah yes, because the best attacks are the ones you're warned ahead of time... I get it would take a ridiculous amount, but I feel like a lot happens that we never hear about...
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:30:04
Yeah, you're right, earlier this month was a one off and could never possibly happen again, but on a worse scale. I must also be crazy to think that everyone should be able to make a transaction on the network rather than just rich people who can't afford the ever increasing fees. I get mining costs money, but not mining doesn't,  so wouldn't it be better to look for an alternative that doesn't require mining?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:22:13
I agree that being deceitful really shouldn't have any place in this, but unfortunately that seem to be the level for some of the major players at the moment.
I guess in terms of transaction time I feel that 10 minute blocks, especially multiple lots of them is non-usable for most real world transactions, which is where I hope this ends up. I'll also add that I don't like all this talk about decentralization. It's not really decentralized, it's just moving the power from a bank, to some guys mom's basement (not trying to offend anyone, just trying to make a point, that the miners really have all the power), and that's something that I don't believe the greater population is ready for.
In terms of IOTA, holy smokes that whitepaper takes me back to my years in uni with all it's crazy maths, but it's also similar(ish) to what I studied, so I find it pretty cool to see it as more than just theory. I'll also be the first to admit that it's not exactly user-friendly yet, but hopefully it leads to something impressive

You mean the shiny rock that has a number of very useful properties like being corrosion resistance and pretty much indestructible...
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:53:30
I think it's safe to say that he's not going to start again if there's a chance he can piggyback on the market presence of the bitcoin name. Besides it's currently 3rd in market cap. It's doing pretty well compared to all other cryptos
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:35:04
I completely agree. He clearly just sees BCH as a more usable coin for what it was intended for, therefore supports it more
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:53:41
You mean no one like maybe a bank or a government or anyone who may suffer loss if this gains too much traction. The US admitted to spending $2.4 trillion (IIRC) on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq 10 years ago. A couple of billion even would be an absolute bargain should someone want to.
Heck Buffett could take it down on his own, just to prove himself correct (not that he would of course).
And a fork wouldn't solve anything, they'd just take that out too. If anyone was willing to do that once, they'd follow through on the remains
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:34:05
Well cash. Generally speaking it's a bit harder with virtual money
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:33:25
I'm not saying it has no value... And no, most currencies have no intrinsic value
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:54:09
I'm not sure the nakamoto consensus is that complex to be honest. I'm just saying something like IOTA seems a lot quicker, more salable and cheaper, with a similar level of decentralization, though it's decentralization should only increase with time
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:43:46
I never got the whole intrinsic value thing. If no one accepts it, it's worthless... Where's the intrinsic value there?
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:35:38
You mean like how BTC is measured in USD
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:34:35
Yes, you're right, the chances of a solar flare emp in the next few years are only like 10% and that would most likely make everyone's hands fall off anyway
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:57:06
That's not the same as intrinsic value. People accept fiat, but doesn't mean it has intrinsic value
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:48:04
I was referring to when almost everyone left to mine BCH and there was over 100,000 unconfirmed transactions.
That's like saying PoW is the best way of solving the most inefficient system. Exponentials are rarely the best way of doing something
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:04:20
Ok if, in some crazy scenario where all the miners stop, or there's an issue processing the the number of transactions. How do I get value out of my bitcoin? How do I exchange them for tangibles like food and shelter?
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:17:35
Is that really a thing though. Like do you think oh that dinner was worth 0.002 of a bitcoin or even that dinner was 2 millibitcoins. I'm not sure we've reach that stage yet...
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:04:10
I'm not sure what you're saying. A shoe is a shoe. A towel is not a shoe?
I'm not arguing that Bitcoin doesn't serve a purpose as money.
It does by definition, I'm pointing out that bitcoin has limited, if any 'intrinsic value'  as an asset
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:47:21
This is a much more logical response. I agree that while an envelope has limited value on its own, it allows you a level of privacy. However I would argue that an envelope has more intrinsic value than bitcoin. If the post office shuts down you can still post a letter into someones letter box yourself (assuming they live near you), but if all the miners stop there isn't anything you can do. You bitcoin becomes instantly worthless does it not?
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:00:32
Your argument that bitcoin has intrinsic value because you can carve you key into something... I can put money in a safe, it doesn't give it more intrinsic value
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:18:52
Well to be fair all it would take to break the nakamoto consensus is an investment in hardware greater than the total current investment aimed to be malicious... Yes it would be a huge waste of money, but if you look at the amount spent on wars I'd say it's probably pretty cheap
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:39:58
But just because something is hard doesn't mean it's not doable. Some organisations have very deep pockets.
I agree quantum computing is still a little way away, but I feel like  something should already be being done
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:33:49
I'm not saying it does. I just said that was a property of gold which gave it some of it's intrinsic value
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:58:38
But it also means it's more likely to be targeted by attacks. Kinda a catch 22.
Plus there's the whole quantum computing issue on the horizon that, as far as I know, is still going to be an issue
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:15:02
But wars fuel innovation...
Besides isn't bitcoin linked with terrorism
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:52:05
But why bitcoin. Why not a crypto with the fast payment function already part of it? I think a lot of the time first mover advantage is over valued
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:02:41
Not trying to shoot you down, but it would be a poor definition of currency. Like would you go into a shop and say "I'll give you 0.01 Telsa shares for that coffee". No, it would just be odd. Or "I'll give you 1 square foot of my land for that jacket". Just because it's an investment doesn't make it a currency
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:12:41
Gold is shiny and rare... So are diamonds... I believe that is where there original value comes from
