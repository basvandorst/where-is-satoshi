Well it is not a huge deal to buy some likes on Fiverr or so. I quitey doubt all the likes are real. For example the last post with the contest has only 15 likes...it is really really low in compare with the total likes amount.
Anyway Coins.ph is great service and my friends from Phillipines living here in Czech are using the service quite regularly.

If you are looking for secure long term cold storage I can recommend Cryptosteel.  . The best combination with Trezor.

"I totally dislike Trezor (locked software, prob hackable, kinda pricey). But i still kike ledger and keepkey"
Trezor Locked software??? Hackable?? Uff, have you read at least some review?
Pricey?? 99 USD vs. 239USD??

Similar analysis tool was already build by one guy only and it is called :  , you can easily identify not only individual addresses, but the entire wallets (composed of hundreds or even thousands of addresses) used by big names like BTCJam, Silk Road and Silk Road 2, Satoshi Dice, BitPay, BitcoinFog, and dozens more.

Unfortunately you do not have as well any single valid argument, why is Ledger better solution than Trezor, just plain words without any get to the point argument. Just one point from this review -  . "Ledger has to be set up on a 100% safe computer which is not an easy task for non technical people."

Would you mind to tell me, what changes the chinese clone bring back to the open source community?
They brought potentionally dangerous device with loads of security issues, also using Java, which is also one of the most potential security risks.
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:18:44
Mycelium is using the same license like SatoshiLabs decided to use for Trezor   .
Is anyone pushing Mycelium to change the license to LGPLv3? No, everyone is absolutely fine with it and using it without any problems.
I know, it is different situation, because they changed it in the reaction to the unsecured poor chinese clone, without any single additional new feature.
Anyway, the hypersensitive bitcoin community should calm down, because if they will be in SatoshiLabs situation, most of them will probably do the same.
Slush personally contributed to the Bitcoin community with all his developments more then most of the community combined. No one can be surprised he is trying to defend his business against someone, who did not bring any single piece of innovation to the industry and just purely take the whole code and created something what is potentially dangerous and has no ability to maintain the code and develop it further.
Do you think common Bitcoin user, who does not even know, how change addresses work, will take care if Trezor is LGPLv3 or Ms-RSL? No, they are looking for simple and secure solution, how to store their coins. The license change will definately do not make TREZOR less secure, because it is still publicly auditable.

well, if he is unsure he can manage to store his coins on paper wallet do you think this setup which is even more painful is something he is looking for. 
this type of setup is nothing for common joe looking for secure and easy solution. His only way and best way how to not rely on any 3rd party online wallet is hardware wallet.

This guy somehow created multi-billion industry so I think he knows what he is talking about.
@_date: 2016-01-18 09:49:03
Why to not choose some hardware wallet instead [TREZOR]( - you have the safest backup available + you can easily spend your coins when needed. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 12:42:25
I had the same problem with Coinbase and Fiverr, sent the exact amount generated on the coinbase payment request page but after 15 minutes nothing happened and I had to contact Fiverr support to solve the issue and needed to wait almost 24 hours to resolved. 
Hard to beleive that company with so huge amount of VC money backing  them is not capable to provide seamless payment flow to its customers.
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:38:59

I have to agree on this, but I think the music should represent the "nightmare" which is now happening in the bitcoin ecosystem.

Great! Now we just need at least 35,000 people willing to spend their coins:-)
@_date: 2015-08-06 20:45:27
It seems you completely missed the main purpose of Trezor, which is not meant to be hot-wallet to carry with you for daily spendings, but secure device for cold storage and safe transaction signing on your laptop or PC. 
Another point, why I should carry with me another standalone device, when I have my smartphone, which is enough secure to spend my coins on the go. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:14:41
May I please ask, how you contributed exactly as a Bitcoin community to the Trezor development or any other open source product development? With commenting on Reddit?
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:52:26
the project is currently running in testing phase and mostly targeted on bitcoin community to test the solution.
The main focus is simple, replace Premium SMS solution, because it is great example, where you are paying high percentage of your earnings to 3rd payment provider, while you can do it with fragment of the cost with Bitcoin.
I think is also better than cash, you do not need to carry with you small coins for vending machines 20, 50 czech crowns are quite heavy in your wallet:-)

Your nick looks you are also from Czech, so you probably read the  page.

Are you really sure the device came already damaged? The scratches looks like they have been made, when you have been opening the box. We all know, the box is sealed very properly, so if you have used something sharp to open it, you could damage the device as well.

Paper wallets are good until you are going to spend from them. Common user who does not have a clue about change addresses is really likely to lose his funds while transfering from Paper wallet to his   mobile or PC wallet. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 21:40:00
With Trezor your backup is your recovery seed with 24words. If you lose your Trezor or it breaks you can recover your keys into any supporting wallet. Electrum, Mycelium etc or into a new Trezor. Your keys are always backed with your recovery seed.
You can have multiple copies of your seed distributed in few safe places. 
Do you think Trezor guys did not thing about this basic security element? 
More info: 
You can even backup your seed with 
And the best part, you can create shared multisig wallet with copay and setup for example 2of3 wallet for your family so always 2 people will be needed to sign a transaction with Trezor.

Do you think merchants who are already accepting credit cards will be willing to spend more money for another terminal just to be able to accept bitcoin? What about some software POS solution on the market, where you do not need to have special hardware but just tablet/phone with software based solution like  . 
Does the terminal support NFC? Or you just used some "old" swipe terminal and rebuild it for Bitcoin?
By the way, I do not know if you seen this. We have custom made Bitcoin POS terminal here in Paralelni Polis and you can pay even with palm of your hand only -  .

With Trezor you do not need to worry about some regular backups at all. You safely store your recovery seed during the inital setup and you are done. Trezor and their myTrezor.com wallet, was one the first companies, which  introduced HD wallets.

I'm a very paranoid person. I (for real) keep offline-generated BIP38 "paper" wallets (actually etched in metal, but that's besides the point) buried in the ground in the forest outside of my town. I leave my cellphone at home when I go to the burial sites so my cellphone company has no record of me being in the area. I use a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated hardware-encrypted thumbdrive, with an encrypted linux partition (on which I have a TrueCrypt container) to store my wallet. I only plug said thumbdrive into a dedicated device (laptop) which doesn't even have a HDD. I'm so paranoid that I actually flashed the BIOS on said laptop with openBIOS. I run Tails OS to access my secure thumbdrive, and I carry the thumbdrive with me around my neck all day (yes I even sleep with it). I'm basically a paranoid nutcase when it comes to my data -- especially my cryptocurrency. I just ordered a Trezor and I'll be storing most of my funds on this device. I hope that gives you an idea of how secure this is. These guys really know what they are doing and have addressed every concern I could imagine.
@_date: 2015-10-26 10:44:15
Well, you can use Trezor with Mycelium the same way. Would you mind to tell me, what other ways are there to be confident about where the transactions are going if you have HW wallet without the screen?
By the way, with Trezor or Keepkey or whatever HW wallet...you do not hold your coins on the device, coins are on the bitcoin network, the device stores just the private keys for them.
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:09:08
Are you planning to add Trezor login to your website as well?
I would love to login using my Trezor without need to fill any username or password..
@_date: 2015-10-22 08:12:33
I´m not getting why they are using Authy, there is Bitid  or login with Trezor  , which works as a 2Fa as well.
@_date: 2015-10-26 09:08:07
Trezor is really easy to use solution. You can choose to use it with multiple wallets - myTrezor.com , Multibit, Electrum or Mycelium on Android. The stainless steel version is currently not on sale. You can choose from white, black and grey -  . 
The screen is definitely big advantage over Ledger, because you can verify where your coins are really going. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 15:28:55
You can load your bitcoin using  to any Visa, Mastercard. Unfortunatly it is not instant, but takes around 2-3 days.
@_date: 2015-10-26 09:27:10


I do not know, if they are legit distributor, but I´m sure you do not need to be worried. Trezor device cannot be easily tampered, because there are few security elements. Holographic seal on the Trezor box. The box by itself is really hard to open, without any chance not to leave any signs of damage on it. The most important, the Trezor device is sealed with ultrasound technology and any attempt to open it, will leave damage on the device. Also if someone will try to upload some evil firmware, Trezor will give you warning about the unofficial firmware, once you connect it to your PC. You can order Trezor directly from  , they deliver to UAE.
@_date: 2017-07-13 00:09:04
I think we are already in similar situation but much smaller company is trying to do so. 
It can secured by ledgers TEE env.  . It is a free SDK for Linux or Windows and resources are offered to let developers create their own applications, but running a production (non debuggable) application requires Intel authorization. 
I´m just looking for some other option and you know more well than me that POS is not very secure and there are not many other options.
@_date: 2015-11-23 14:20:30
hmm, not correct. Trezor is running customized version of BOP on their own servers. However this is not really important, because BOP is handling only transaction history and balances. The main thing is TREZOR, which can work with any supported 3rd party wallet.
@_date: 2015-10-26 21:10:25
I think this is totally unacceptable for company with 30M.+ in VC funding, to be whole day offline and to have these type of issues quite regularly.
Also last update from their Twitter is from 5 hours ago. 
I´m now definitely sure, the only way, how I can really manage my private keys is some kind of Hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger, where I do not need to rely on any 3rd party with my private keys.
@_date: 2015-02-19 08:32:46

(PoWs) in blockchains are wasteful.
PoWs are nonetheless the most robust solution today to two fundamental problems in decentralized cryptocurrency design: 
How to select consensus leaders and how to apportion rewards fairly among participants. 
A participant in a PoW system, known as a miner, can only lead
consensus rounds in proportion to the amount of computation
she invests in the system. This prevents an attacker from gaining majority power by cheaply masquerading as multiple machines. The cost, however, is the abovementioned waste. PoWs serve no useful purpose beyond consensus and incur huge monetary and environmental costs. Today the Bitcoin network uses more electricity than produced by a nuclear reactor, and is projected to
consume as much as Denmark by 2020 [30]. 
Solution to the problem of such waste in
a novel block-mining system called REM. Nodes using
REM replace PoW’s wasted effort with useful effort of
a form that we call Proof of Useful Work (PoUW). In a
PoUW system, users can utilize their CPUs for any desired
workload, and can simultaneously contribute their
work towards securing a blockchain.
