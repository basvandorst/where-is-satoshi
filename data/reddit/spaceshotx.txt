Don't think of it as a roller coaster, think of it more like that skateboard you had when you were a kid. Remember? You were dumb as fuck so you just jumped on board and headed straight down that huge hill. Soon the skateboard started oscillating back and forth, and the oscillations got bigger and bigger, all the while you thought you might be able to hang on and control it, and then it just shot out from under your feet at 100 MPH, and you sat in the street and watched it sail away? That's what BTC is going to do to us. 
Except in this little story we don't land on our ass on the pavement and get all blood. No, this time, we land in a pile of Benjis
ALLLLLLLL AABBBBOOOOOOOAAAAARRRRRDDD!
For any of you young kids out there making cash and spending it on all sorts of crazy shit like booze and toys and  girls, etc, take $1,000 or more today and go buy one or more BTC, store it in a really safe place, and forget about it.  It could change your entire life's trajectory.
Ever look back at home prices? You talk to your dad or grandparents and you're like, "wow, you could buy a house for $10,000 back then? Why didn't you buy 10 houses???
BTC is the same, except the scale is going to make the housing ROI look ridiculously tiny

Just like all the fake news pumpers (ex. CNN), you should read multiple news outlets (CNN and FoxNews for example), and let your brain figure out which one is the fake and/or censored news. It's good to cross check them both with a few other sites like infowars.com and zerohedge.com, and even beforeitsnews.com. Then, for example, once you notice a trend and figure out CNN is fake and pumping out pro-socialist obama-hillary-shit propaganda non-stop, you can safely stop reading/watching it. But make your own decision, read them all for a while. The fakery is easy to spot fairly quickly if you read multiple sources. 
I don't know what's up w/ /btc vs /bitcoin, so I just read them both. If one starts looking censored or fake or whatever, I'll drop it.

OK, I'm going to share a theory... I think it's quite possible that big players like GS directly or indirectly loaded WAY THE FUCK up on BTC early on, I mean REAL early on, and they are riding the up and down waves, and POSSIBLY even helping to cause them. So I think we can expect a long term upward trend, WAY the fuck up, but GS and co are going to make nice profits at every bump along the way, manipulating the market up and down and cashing in on the waves as much as possible all the way up. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 00:24:06
One thing that bothers me... sort of like obama bothered me from the first day I learned of him... is that wikileaks banned me when I kept asking them to provide a timestamped video of Assange proving he was alive. How hard would it have been for Assange to send a current video? 
EVERYTHING fucking changed the day we heard about that raid on the embassy. The entire tone and frequency of the podesta and p1 z z a g4te emails, Assange's appearances, wikileaks posts, etc. The leaks were on a super roll leading up to a crescendo and then BAM, the day of the raid, it all stopped. Some drivel useless shit came out after that, but... nah something still smells funny, brahs.

Speaking of evolution, what transaction fee do you guys typically add to get your transaction to go as fast as possible? The transaction fee issue is still a bit too complex for the average Joe--the bitcoin wallet developers need to make that super simple stupid for more adoption. 
For example, the default tranny fee is like 0.0001 in the wallet I was just using. And if you send that, you wait a fuckternity to see confirmations. Average Joe is going to say F-THIS! when he has to wait for money to move around. Come on peeps, this ain't rocket science. You have to make it so your grandmother can  do it.
@_date: 2016-12-01 12:37:34
Listen, I'm going to school you for free, kid.
First, here's a good life lesson for you: pretend for a second you don't know everything, because you don't. And you never will. (Neither will I, but I'm really close.) Someone will always know something you don't. So pretending you know everything is an inherently failed strategy so you should abandon it.
So free lesson  it's possible to send some transactions and then they get stuck and remain at 0 confirmations forever, so to speak... days, weeks, months go by... much worry, so pain. The trannies aren't going to confirm. So your "wait it out" option, that ain't gonna work. 
Collude with a minor, ppppfffffft, that is a fucking nightmare for average Joe. He probably doesn't even know what a miner is. 
RBF and CPFP: oh boy, I don't even [want to] know what the fuck they are but I can guarantee they are some geek's wet dream of a process to unstick a transaction that the average Joe will poop his pants trying to read, understand, and maybe even try to execute and quite possibly fail at. 
So that leaves us with my even better solution. It's super simple, it's 100% free, takes about an hour, and a monkey could do it. But I'm not going to tell YOU what it is now because you were so rude! 
Private message me if you need to know the solution, if you have stuck transactions and no hope. 
Class dismissed.
@_date: 2016-12-06 12:15:55
Wow, why on earth would you say that? I see it as the exact opposite. 
The wealthy have all their money stored up in various safe havens... banks, investment accounts, real estate, etc. The masses typically roll with small amounts of money, cash... 
Bitcoin allows the little guy to send that money to his friends and businesses all over the world instantly. And as of right now, corrupt governments don't really have their filthy hands in it stealing off the top. So I would think it's the quintessential masses tool, at the moment. 
I do agree with you on one piece of that statement of yours though: the big boys are playing the BTC game. Early on in the life of BTC, the GS folks had guys at the BTC exchanges checking them out. I would guarantee GS and the other big financial players have a big stake and they are keeping it quiet. I have no proof of this, just a hunch. I would also imagine they are continuously buying in each week or day for a bigger stake, under the radar. Again, just a hunch. There's probably a way to prove that right or wrong using the blockchain research tools. 
Also, some hedge funds are starting to take BTC positions as well. 
Adoption of the wallets is taking off exponentially... I think we are sitting on a massive rocket that is going to launch soon. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 12:54:45
I looked at the double spend process steps and trust me, the upgrade solution above is a lot easier.

@_date: 2016-12-01 12:44:57
Sure what? 
OK listen, because I'm a nice guy and I enjoyed our banter, here's the solution:
1. Upgrade your old BTC wallet to the latest version: Download Bitcoin Core. Run the install in the same folder as your old Bitcoin Wallet app. Go here to get it: 
2. Let the block chain sync up and get happy. Wait for it to be all synced up even if it takes days. 
3. Run the new Bitcoin app you just installed. Go into the Transactions tab and you will see your still 0/6 unconfirmed transactions. 
4. Right click "Abandon" on the stuck transactions. Your transaction will be marked as Abandoned and your BTC will return to your balance.
That's it. 
Now apologize!

Spliff it up brother. I think you will be able to buy all the paraphernalia you want in the not-to-distant future if that's your thing. You're going to be "the genius".
I am having fun watching the progress of the btc virus. Little fringe edgy outfits starting to accept it, then some mainstream places, then more, then Fidelity saying "oh yeah, we mine it". You can bet your ass the big financial guys are already balls deep in BTC and they are just waiting. They're not stupid. GS was way the fuck ahead of the game and visiting MtGox in its infancy. They are on it. But you can get on it too. Even now, BTC is a STRONG BUY. 
As far as I can tell, escorts and hookers aren't accepting it yet, but when they do, OOOOOHHHHHH BOYYYYY! 
Also remember, (I did the math before and it was great, but I don't care to do it again, you can do it) the cap on btc forever is like 21 million btc or something like that. And the total world money supply is like 14 trillion or something like that. Divide that up... future looks bright if nothing catastrophic happens. 
ALL our best information says HOLD. So you fucking hold. Don't let doubt creep in. If the best information changes, then MAYBE you think about MAYBE selling. But they have been cacking about how btc was going to die for a long time. I call bullsit. 
And one last piece of wisdom, if it's really that. I've noticed over the years that suddenly the news media outlets will post articles saying something like, just using an example "Oh, bitcoin is going to crash because blah blah blah, and this guy and that guy say it's going to crash, etc" and then it takes a HUGE dip in price. And then, you know what I think is happening? All those insider fucks are BUYING. And then sure as fuck, a short while later out comes some new articles, "oh, that turned out to be false because blah blah blah blah fucking blippity blah", and the price goes way the fuck up. Not just on btc but on a lot of things. Like OIL, stocks, gold, whatever. 
Just like these big corps are controlling corrupt cunts like Hillary and Obama, they also own the media (Murdock now owns Fox and it's going into the shitter, now supporting Hillary/Obama/DNC/corruption bullshit like turds), so since they own the media, they can effectively insider trade by making the fucking sell news so they can buy. 
I am pretty sure that's happening on a big fucking scale and that's how the 1% stay in the 1%. 
Take that for what it's worth: just one super smart motherfucker's opinion.

Guys, it's just going to be one thing after the next. 
If you have btc, you are on a surfboard on the biggest financial tsunami ever. 
STRAP IN!
(fucking girl scouts are taking btc)
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:35:15
Hillary and Obama are not going to like that fucking lowball.
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:58:35
It should have gone up, especially yesterday, it rose like 600 points.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:52:17
Yeah, I know what you are saying. 
I don't really care to get the math to the exact trillionth. So it's basically just "a whole fuckload of money"/a dinky 21 million btc.
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:15:12
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:26:39
All I know is wherever there's big money to be made, those guys are in first.
Also, GS was sniffing around the btc exchanges EARLY on. WAY early. 
The chances of them taking a wiff of btc and thinking it stank? 0
I don't think they can control it completely, but I do think they can maybe sway it, and possibly have proven mechanisms to sway such things, and certainly make a pantload of money off it.
Note, all this is speculation. Take it for what it is. GS is trying to make a buck, just like everyone else is. I'm sure if there's a lot of invisible hand stuff going on, it's not just limited to GS.

Which account balance?
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:29:34
Yes you are right.
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:58:31
The IRS probably has cryptography skills that would astound even you.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:27:11
Oh it's only going up 100 per day still? 
Very soon it will be 1000 / day.
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:28:28
Interesting viewpoint.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:50:12
Can someone tell me, SUPER fucking briefly, wtf SEGWIT is and why I might care?
@_date: 2017-07-07 16:25:30
I don't doubt the rigor of crypto, and you are probably right. I would just never assume you know everything the IRS/gov is up to or capable of. The IRS backing off just raises a red flag in my mind.
Maybe the current president reigned them in from the lawless ways every gov agency stooped to during the corrupt reign of the president before him.
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:50:56
How did you get your daily dose of obamaspeak spoonfed to you?
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:16:38
Holy shit
And as for that dweeb's comment "I'm strongly opposed to audit the fed." JUST WHO THE FUCK DO THESE CUNTS THINK THEY ARE, AND WHOSE FUCKING MONEY DO THEY THINK THEY ARE PLAYING WITH.
How about you open your fucking books or the People show up at all your fucking houses tomorrow morning??
Enough is a fucking nuff. We have the numbers, we should not be taking one iota of shit from these corrupt motherfuckers.
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:00:44
LOL! Yes, you are right. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 12:45:51
They probably hacked all the passwords. Fuck the IRS.
I think Lao Tzu said something like "If you want to attack, fake a retreat."
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:29:11
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:01:52
Strap in, you fuckers ain't seen nuthin yet.
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:28:52
Yes... I am your source.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:01:21
Told you this was going way the fuck back up. Invisible hands are deep into this cookie jar. Ride the rollercoasters they're going to make. It's how they make money. They somehow get the media to tell everyone btc is fucked, and half of you fucktards believe it and scurry to the exits, they load up on your shit, and then bam, the bitcoin monster comes back. 
Goldman is BALLS FUCKING DEEP IN BTC. I said this years ago. BALLS DEEP!
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:16:31
I wasn't thinking that but good idea. I'm sure President Trump would turn the FED into something we are proud of, instead of ashamed of.
All he does is win.
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:18:55
Haha, omg stop you are killing me! LOL!
You must be so said that Fake News CNN is about to die. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:58:31
CNN is all done. 100% guaranteed--at least as an even remotely credible news source. Fake News CNN is a corrupt Democrat propaganda machine... and everyone on the planet (except for you, it seems), knows it. 
Watch out, don't get caught bad mouthing CNN, though. Someone might be secretly video taping you. Keep your true opinions quiet! SHHHHH!! GOOD BOY!!!
@_date: 2016-07-25 18:03:10
LOVE this one, "Bitcoin was not backed by any government or bank,". Now is that statement supposed to make it legit or illegit! ROTFL!!
Burn it, burn it all down.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:11:27
Maybe congress will reconsider, considering yesterday. If they start seizing all the peoples' shit, they will probably want to avoid public places.
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:27:16
Lots of people are bullshitters, I don't think this McAfee guy is one of them. He killed a bunch of fucking people or they tried to kill him with shotguns or some shit, in a foreign land, toppled their government or some shit, had all the federales looking for him, somehow escaped back to the Land of the Free, and now he's talking about eating his own cock. I think he would gobble that fucker and not even use hot sauce.
PS. BTC is going to the FUCKING MOON.
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:41:41
You honestly think they would worry about a warrant? Maybe under Trump, yes, you might be right. Certainly not over the previous 8 years though.
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:40:58
The big invisible hand guys really did a great job getting this humongous dip... now watch them reap it. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:11:36
Call Fake News CNN, Russia is obviously trying to collude with the Burger King!
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:43:41
I almost want to use the term bankers and government leaders in the same breath. So many of them are tangled up with one another and corrupt as fuck. We need to purge.
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:18:30
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:24:43
I agree. But they and their ilk will find a new way to subject everyone.  So although having your money in btc will help, it won't eliminate the source of the problem--the corrupt bankers and politicians.
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:21:44
Yeah I was there when lead was flying at $17. Blood everywhere, shit everywhere. Bodies all over, limbs, people crying. That was just before the waves started from the big boys. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:19:56
Until the people kill a whole bunch of bankers and government officials who allow this sort of thing, things won't change. I'm rooting for the day. So many people and so few bankers and government officials. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:57:47
Relax, Francis.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:34:41
15 BTC... I'd want them to be hurt... badly.
That other guy's suggestion for a bounty hunter sounds great.
