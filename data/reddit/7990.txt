Why are you using 2.52^x and 2^y instead of 2^x_1 and 2^y ? This is giving you two numbers that cannot be compared. 
2.52^5 &gt; 2^6
175000 x 174999 x 174998 x 174997 174996 x 174995 x 174994 x 174993 x 174992 x 174991 x174990 x 174989 
is equal to 824693913956754067229207555670698635251882769851523114560000000 which is 2^~209
2^209 is significantly larger than 2^160 - A good 14 orders of magnitude larger.

Mt. Gox is an example of why we need things like insurance and dispute resolution. Not an example of why we need centralization. 
A stateless society would still have things like BBB for reputation systems. There would be multiple ones, the consumer chooses whether or not to trust an agency. It was largely known that Mt. Gox was not trustworthy yet people still used them.
The current system preys on the weak, welfare causes more harm than good and keeps the poor poor. 'illegal' immigrants can't compete for jobs in an open market. My system would give opportunities to these people.

'regulating' is a buzzword. It says nothing of what you actually want and gives the illusion of being in the interest of the customer/citizen.
That being said. OpenBazaar allows for mediators and multisig which solve any problem you think needs to be solved by a central authority.

If they can learn to use a brand new currency they can "learn" a new OS. Realistically, any mainstream GNU/Linux distro has very little learning curve for an average user. 
The install of Debain is actually easier than a Windows install.
Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSuSE, Elementary, and I'm missing a ton. These all have very easy install processes then a simple search of "how to install bitcoin on X" will tell them the command they need to run "apt-get install bitcoin-qt" "yum install bitcoin-qt" etc.

This specific change is good but it opens the door for the government to say they have authority over Bitcoin. This is the same issue that lead to our whole Net Neutrality mess we're in now.

fair is relative. the purest degree of "fair" would be a terrible society. Everyone gets the same everything, no one deviates from this exact mold.


How is this different than paying taxes?


You realize that most of these are contracted to private companies through local governments? The "public" part is the middle man.


Volunteer fire departments exist. A community of people would gladly pay for a fire department to cover their area, think Home Owners Association type fees that these people are VOLUNTARILY paying them. If we had multiple fire departments competing for grounds we'd have more innovation and lower prices for these services.
As for police, the same holds true. But they'd be a very different type of police than what we have now. Think security at concerts, not actively looking for 'law'-breakers. The same competition aspect of having multiple potential security companies would lead to the same innovation and lower prices as well as trying to please those paying. 
Please continue this list?

Again, you're clinging to Milton Friedman as if he is the single authority on libertarianism.
Governance is needed but this does not mean it has to be in a centralized or mandatory nature, in fact the more decentralized it is - being the more nodes that exist - the more likely people are to get the sort of rules that they would want. 
If you want a very quick introduction to how laws could work in a stateless society look up [David Friedman's Machinery of Freedom]( This is a summary of the third section of his book by the same title.
As for military, it is needed in a society of states, but not in a stateless society. If a single nation went stateless, its open trade would result in many allies and very few enemies, if the entire world went stateless wars would more or less be irrelevant. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 19:12:14
Yes, at one point in time the regulation and centralization were an advancement from what had existed before - largely monarchism and absolutism. And they will be followed by decentralization and privatization in a stateless society.

Milton Friedman was not an anarchist. He was a minarchist. He was very open about this. His son, David Friedman, is an anarchist and has had speeches on this very concept.
With regards to an anarcho-capitalist society, Milton said it might work but it probably won't and David said it probably would work but might not.
