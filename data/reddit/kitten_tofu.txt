I understand the nature of the equilibrium that will eventually be reached... I thought you gave me more credit than that :p
Here's the same attack scenario I tried to explain in the original post, framed differently again:
We're at a point where mining exists at equilibrium, and profitability is very low. Our adversary creates a pool that does payouts at 101% ; in this future, a 1% edge is *huge*. It might quadruple profits. It might be TEN times the regular profit -- remember, profitability is converging on zero here in some theoretically super efficient market (which may not ever happen in practice!).
So, of course, miners switch to the 101% pool, and it's a requirement of the pool that you don't engage in Two Phase Proof of Work. In fact, no matter what scheme miners use for ethical reasons, they can just do whatever the adversary insists they should, instead, as a condition of the pool.
Now, sure, maybe not everybody "sells out" for 101%, maybe they sell out for 102% or 103%, maybe they don't sell out at all, but the exact numbers aren't relevant. The point is that, at present, this only costs the adversary $18k per day, and that's assuming they already have 50% of the network (it's cheaper whilst they are gaining a following). And of course, they can start making that $18k back through nefarious manipulation, assuming:
 1. That the miners are unethical or
 2. That the miners are not set up to automatically switch over if they detect that the chain they are mining is being mined in secret.
Furthermore, if some of the pools are paying out 101%, then the miners who refuse to switch to "unethical pools" will actually start running at a loss -- remember, super efficient market.
Who knows if this situation will ever happen, but I found it interesting to think about.

I haven't run the numbers, so I can't even give an estimate, but surely the cost of the attack isn't the trillions that people often tout when they talk about the cost of buying and running all that hardware.
More to the point, the cost of this attack should converge on some constant value.. And it's unknown to me how close that constant is to zero. I.e. you claim it's too expensive for someone with, e.g. no miners.
Why is it too expensive...
1. In the present? (because hey, we're still chugging along with no massive reorgs, and mining is still profitable for some)
2. In the future? (is my assertion that mining profits converge on zero even true?)

Makes sense, thanks!

You understand most of what I'm saying (there will be a point in time where everything is in equilibrium), but I still think you're missing my point.
Let me first reiterate that I do understand that the "raw" cost of a 51% attack is "tough and expensive". It really is; nobody can buy all that equipment. But that's not what I'm talking about. I don't think the hash rate will drop.
The cost that I'm talking about is equal to whatever is required to persuade any miners (including miners who have their rigs turned OFF) to point at an adversary's pool.
Let's say our adversary has a pool with payouts at 102% of whatever is mined, costing her about $18k per day. That's assuming she's convinced half of all miners to mine on her pool; if only 25% have "sold out" to her lucrative pool, then it's only costing her about $9k per day. And so on.
So, 18k per day isn't much, it's certainly not "tough and expensive" -- not as tough and expensive as we would like, anyway.

Makes sense! Thanks for taking the time to explain

Thanks for taking the time.
I understand the cost of running 51% of the mining power. What I'm referring to in the original post is the equilibrium that is eventually reached. When you get to a point where there is no more growth, or very little growth, and everything is stable. What happens when the market is saturated with miner equipment and the profit of mining really does converge on zero?
I appreciate that I don't know much about the current mining climate (I didn't take offense at your comment, DW).

encryption + decryption is just application of EC group operations.




Addresses are more convenient for people. blockchain.info does the pubkey resolution for us. I don't like the idea of using blockchain.info, but your local client probably doesn't index the whole blockchain, so keeping things local would be slow.


Good point - oh well!


Because this is fine. Either you trust the code or you don't (in which case read the source).

I may have made a mistake somewhere. The code is there if you care to check it, would appreciate an expert's feedback.


Good point, one ought to be able to use either. I'll add the option to use a public key also.

Thanks for the response. I guess that makes sense, but it's a bit disappointing that we have to rely on people behaving selflessly if we start seeing big reorgs. Like, it would be nice to have this property that Bitcoin is sound even if we assume 100% selfish participants.
