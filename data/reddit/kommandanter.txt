I have a great amount of money in bitcoin and I would love for someone to please explain this to me.  I know I'm sorry, I'm triggering...

 Would recommend investing 5% of your income in bitcoin.  Join the party dude !

I'm at an all-time high.  Wow.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:55:57
I apologize.  I read bitcoin news on the internet everyday to try to keep up, which is also the reason I've subscribed to this subreddit.  I was just having trouble understanding what is recently happening.

Right my b.

Same.  Well, I've slowly bought up to .917...

Well.  A bit of background:  I'm 22 years old and work in the oilfield.  I have no kids or a wife.  No obligations really.

Duly noted. What would you recommend to someone who has their bitcoin in Coinbase? How would I send it somewhere else, and where to? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:02:05
Shift card?? Please tell me more.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:20:47
Why shouldn't you keep Bitcoin in a Coinbase wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:54:37
Haha.  We'll definitely see I guess!  Thanks for the reply my dude! 
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:09:50
Duly noted thank you for your opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:09:23
Nothing honestly.  I just pay rent and other bills.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:44:42
Very good information, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:48:03
