Tough question to answer, depends how everything goes over the next year. I'd say between 1 month and a few years lol.

Haha i know basic tax laws, not the question.  IRS is auditing people who invested 20k+ in bitcoin b/t 2013 and 2015 because they made HUGE profits and are easy targets.  I definitely pay my taxes but was curious as to why they were auditing so many people (based on the article i read today).  Now i see the IRS was specifically targeting people in the earlier years who made such significant profits. Just thought it was odd they were targeting anyone who invested 20k recently, as it is a relatively small amount of money.   Turns out, they are not targeting those people.

Didn't sell yet, definitely made a significant profit.  Plan on reporting to IRS once i cash out.  I am just wondering if it is something i should expect.

Right but a lot of people also sold and took the profit, and those are the people I'm talking about.

Lol love the advice, but I would bet quite a bit that I made well over 50 times your trading by hodling btc, then cashed out enough to keep me and my entire family happy and well cared for...and I still kept more than enough in to still ride the rollercoaster. You must be new to this.  You can make $ either way, but don’t act like people holding coins are idiots just because you were too late to make any serious gains :-)
