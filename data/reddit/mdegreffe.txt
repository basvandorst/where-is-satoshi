Sure, if you stretch the definition of ponzi to include market bubbles. This is just a creative way to get the words bit coin and ponzi together without having to directly accuse anyone of anything. Typical bank fud response.

Bitcoin will grow in value. Depending on how much Bitcoin you own, you'll become wealthy. It's a new currency, so it'll take time to establish itself, but once it does, it'll be the one-world currency.

What was the political view of Satoshi nakamoto?

Any law prohibiting individuals from dealing in cryptocurrency is fundamentally an unenforceable joke.
Please, governments of the world, give us more reasons to laugh at you. We hardly need them, but they sure are fun.

Any address can be tracked easily. But the owner of address is anonymous. At some extent it is still anonymous. We can generate as many addresses as we can to receive BTC instantly with no one knowing the owner.

"Bitcoin will still be subject to corporation tax" so as far as I understood individuals won't be charged a tax? if so UK is a very forward-thinking country, instead of threating btc system like other countries it helps to make a progress

Maybe price will go up and maybe will fall down. This is something that cant be predicted also it cant be predicted price for cryptos.
Seem like that it will take some time to pass before some changes accouter off course that mean that lot of companies get involved in cryptos

Very nice point of view, a failure of one will stimulate progress of others, other companies will take into consideration past mistakes and will develope very quick. But tell all this stuff to people who lost their money, big money

Interesting insights, makes me think I should hang on to the domains I have for a bit longer
Thanks for sharing

From the original EBA report:
"A governance authority may, at first, appear incompatible with the conceptual origins of VCs as a decentralised scheme that does not require the involvement of a central bank or government. However, the mandatory creation of a scheme governance body does not imply that VC units have to be centrally issued. This function can remain decentralised and be run through, for example, a protocol and a transaction ledger." -- EBA Opinion on ‘virtual currencies’ pp. 40 -- 
I agree with the EBA that an officially regulated virtual currency would be useful.

Someone may send to the wrong address and could be sad to lose 20 BTC. Absolutely return back to the sending address. Same as pick up a wallet containing cash, card, ID etc, what will you do?

The amount of good news is making me excited that the next boom may be coming sooner than we expected.

bitcoin does not need big funding, its started off as a voluntary project with random people across the world. now its funded via itself.. the coders get paid bitcoin.. and its the general public buying bitcoin from people that hold bitcoin, thus the general public are funding bitcoin..

This question has too much depth for my mind. For me BTC is cryptocurrency and that is all

I took myself for an incredibly expensive ride as some sort of psychological ego wish fulfillment bullshit that I coulda woulda shoulda done sort of thing, true, the farce of mining at the present inclusive of that, and also my willingness to buy into it.

Nice article, helps to learn more about Karpeles as a person. And it's a first time when I read about Bitcoin cafe, it really looks like a great idea, very stylish. I regret he won't be able to finish it

Very interesting, this is the first time I've thought about it this way, that with the rise of Bitcoin, there have been large innovations in fields such as anonymous transactions/privacy, "decentralized trading", "decentralized applications" and more.

Governments discourage a lot of things, pot smoking, prostitution, culture sharing (slandered by governments as "piracy"). Free-thinking people generally don't give a damn.

I think nobody will buy there stuff using BTC, but it's a very cheap and useful advertising.

 I also do not agree with the OP's text, but... let ideas flow. freedom is better than censorship. May the readers exercise their criticism.
