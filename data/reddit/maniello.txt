Why don't you take a print screen?
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:50:15
Yeah but sadly they don't deliver in Hungary

The washington Post has a ".com" domain, this link takes you to a ".org" one. Seems like a scam to me!

Beautiful pictures! I would really appreciate if you would make a few for smartphones too (iPhone 4S for me :P)
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:23:15
real first world probz right there

I tried to order an external case for an old PATA/IDE HDD from overstock.com and I ran into two problems:
They still dont accept Bitcoins from outside of the US (the guy on the chat said that they are currently working on implementing this feature). And my other problem was that the enclosure's price is $22.6 plus $12.8 in taxes. And now comes the real turn-off: shipping to Hungary costs $33.5. So basically a case that costs $22.6 (around $16 in the US store) costs $70 dollars. Even if I could pay with Bitcoins, I wouldnt do so because of the shipping cost. Thanks, but no thanks
So as far as I can tell, there is still a lot more space for these kind of websites to expand to make the European customers' lives easier
EDIT: formatting
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:21:20
still a scam
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:18:37
I guess you could follow [bitcoinstore]( Right now they only have the case for the Moto Zoom
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:45:20
I like that you made it smartphone friendly! First impression is good, I might start using it although right now I dont really need a tool like this. But of course this is just me

PayPal should already accept the ft that they cant stop this revolution

I totally forgot that I'm giving you guys a great opportunity to start making puns
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:33:17
At least we die trying, on our feet

If you would like to earn the support of a community, you should do a spellcheck and provide some proof. After that, I hope that you can achieve your goals! Ask the mods for proofing
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:26:11
Maybe you should click on what is this?
Or you could read this: basically they tip them the price of a tea/beer. So it's kind I like they invited them for one to show their appreciation
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:09:36
nooo. its not a crash. its just a little droppy-drop in the pricey-price
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:45:04
someone should do it again
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:07:09
the floor
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:41:16
Im just saying that a crash is more of a sudden price drop than the average of prices throughout a whole month
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:38:15
Since when is [+25631.51%]( in 2 years a crash? it's relative. A ~25% drop in less than 24 hours seems like a crash to me
EDIT: added a screenshot
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:23:25
I still find it to be a lot more entertaining read than any post about charts or memes or sellbuysellbuys
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:52:44
maybe we should do an AMA with him

My family and I go to Austria to ski very year, most of the time to resorts in the Tirol area. Hopefully I can make it to your place soon!

Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency and not a stock. So I would much rather not have more bubbles but a stable growth.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:32:02
I feel like I am reading one right now.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:03:15
seem legit. imma proceed and download this great thing right onto my computer
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:54:29
you could always get bitcoins for others as presents
@_date: 2013-10-18 12:29:03
For some reason I have a strong feeling that you did some really deep research before saying these numbers...
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:21:12
If I were you I would wait until this crash or correction or insert any other name here will end and the market will stabilize just to see clearly
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:10:15
never ask for financial advice on the webz but if i were you i would wait until things calm down.
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:45:15
Don't see any...
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:18:48
I was just about to say that soon we should start discussing banning all the lets ban topics

Do I understand right that I can purchase [1 BTC for $497.77?](
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:26:03
Thank you for your post. This is a real gem compared to all the damned memes
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:55:11
i wouldnt use the term many. i would use the word countless
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:26:22
I would wait until things calm down... it might stop here or go down even further
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:49:04
dont know ask the other 30 people who have already posted a screenshot like this
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:13:19
maybe you should have not reposted it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:04:31
What crash? I thought its a week's end flash sale

Jesus Christ I have already seen this chart at least 10 times in the past 5 minutes
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:25:25
as $830 does too, then $840 also... it depends in which 5 minutes you check it
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:36:11
hey kids, be nice to each other and proceed with your games
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:04:19
thank you. would you tell us in details what makes you think that?
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:18:48
I've done my duty sir: upvoted your thread and downvoted the two others about BTC breaking a milestone. Let's clean this place!
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:27:34
I'm glad it turnt out this great and thanks for the picture with the numbers!
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:13:31
Yeah but with like 800 subscriptions
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:18:46
Thank you for letting me know, my Bitstamp, Bitcoinity tabs, my Menu Bar ticker and my iPhone app haven't informed me yet and I only check the news only once a year
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:30:24
[coinchat.org]( is a great bitcoin community. At least it was around a month ago when I quit because I spent too much time on that site
EDIT: added direct link
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:14:56
good luck with that. seriously
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:23:05
btcReport. It's a great app IMO with a clean GUI. The price change notifications are offered as a one time IAP for 4.99 EUR if Im corretc. But I think it was worth it, I like the app a lot
