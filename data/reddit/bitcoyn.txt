My last transaction took almost an hour to confirm with 3x the base fee. Last year the same transaction would have taken 20 MINUTES or less with the base fee. This is f@ BS. We are going backwards on purpose to make lightning more feasible. 
Maybe there's a place for lightning down the road but for now we can solve this problem by changing a f 1 to a 2. BITCOIN CAN SCALE!

Absolutely ridiculous that this story gets banned from r/bitcoin. It's VERY relevant to the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:26:49
OPTION ONE – Change the blocksize upper limit to two megabytes. One line of code for the constant, about ten LOCs for activation trigger logic. Requires upgrading of a majority server software.
OPTION TWO – Introduce Segwit. About 500 lines of new code, of which at least 100 in the hypersensitive consensus code. Requires upgrading a majority of server software and all client/wallet software and client/wallet hardware, especially those needing to pay money to an arbitrary address (as Segwit introduces a new type of address).

So tell me why Segwit should come first again?

The problem is that they seem to be shaping (some would say hijacking) bitcoin to fit the needs of their company. 
It is very possible and should be the goal for bitcoin to manage all transactions at a reasonable fee and without a third party. That's the vision myself and many others signed up for. Blockstream devs have no insentive to strive for that vision. And their actions suggest they are striving for the opposite.

Yes that's great. Love it that I can secure my wealth. But what if I actually want to USE my wealth? Do you really want to do that on some third party lightning network (that doesn't even exist yet). 
The blockchain can do both!!! That's the vision that has excited me and offers a true revolution.
The Blockstream settlement layer version of Bitcoin; the version that just so happens to fit their business model; is not needed.

It wasn't meant as an attack. Just a statement I believe to be true based on specific actions I've witnessed.  Some of the people I am specifically thinking of are highly intelligent. But when intelligence lacks wisdom it can have very bad results akin to the teenager that thinks he knows it all. This is especially true when egos get involved. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:55:41
High fees are good. We want everyone on third party lightning networks. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:56:17
If loudest people making your argument were not acting like petulant adolescents then perhaps I'd have more time for it. 
Furthermore many core developers pushing your solutions just happen to work for a FOR PROFIT company that will just happen to benefit from them. It's a BLATANT CONFLICT OF INTEREST. 
Finally, the people I respect who have made bitcoin what it is today (Gavin, Garzic, Hearn, and even Satoshi himself) all suggest that block size is an issue and it can be dealt with easily and safely by simply changing one line of code. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:17:53
Ideally the bitcoin foundation would have been run properly and set up to fund development. 
It's not an easy answer but I can tell you how it shouldn't be funded. It shouldn't be funded by a for profit company that depends on the code being written in a certain way that benefits them. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:59:57
Scaling is what Bitcoin needs right now. SegWit was never designed as a scaling solution. It is way over built and complex. It is hundreds of lines of code. 
Segwit is being pushed through because it will (one day, if lightning networks actually get solved) allow for, for profit, third party off chain solutions.
Raising the blocksize properly to make Bitcoin scale is literally a one line of code change. Change a 1mb  to a 2mb or 4mb or 8mb. It is a simple solution and it is what Satoshi intended.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:43:37
Then take what you have now and just up the limit to 4mb. That is completely safe!! 
Plus you could get segwit added that way. The 4mb would buy you time to get lightning working. If it's as promiseing as you say it is, people will switch to that when we start to bump up against 4mb.
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:58:31
Seriously, why not just change the blocksize limit. A simple change to 4mb could get segwit in with massive consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:20:29
In software development, simplicity is better than complexity.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:25:51
Dude, it's for FUNCTIONAL reasons!
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:23:46
With consensus it can be done easily. Something like 4mb with segwit could get consensus.
Plus you know that Bitcoin has already successfully​ hardforked before right? It was done within a day.
Also the eth hardfork is another hardfork success example. Have you checked the price of eth today? That's bitcoins market cap getting eaten while we sit here arguing.

What do miners get out of a having a 2, 4 or 8mb block? What is the advantage for them? Honest question... 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:25:43
The industry, miners, and good portion of the community are in the process of firing core. You can see what the market thinks of that by checking the price of BCH.
Do some research and find your own opinion. Just know that this sub and some other forums are rigged to favour core.
PS - if you own BTC and not BCH, you better hope that the New York agreement fork goes smoothly and most miners support it. Otherwise a good percentage of the hash power will move to BCH. BTC will slow to a crawl at that point.

Good point on the privacy thing; wholeheartedly am for a lightning network for those types of transactions. But you're still trusting a third party, right? Kind of like trusting a VPN when they say they don't log.
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:33:16
I personally just want a crypto currency that I control that I can transact with in in a way that is better than a credit card. Bitcoin used to be that; I have used bitcoin to purchase (a now very expensive) dinner before. I should be able to still do that; service workers and business people should be able to use bitcoin. But they can't or won't because transaction times are currently too long and fees are too high.
Maybe lightning solves the problem (I'm skeptical as it does not seem user friendly to me) but uptake of lightning to the point where, say, a hairdresser can use it for their business seems a long... long way off.
Listen, I'm not trying to be a shill or difficult. I just want a global digital currency as soon as possible. It seemed bitcoin was best positioned to be that but maybe bitcoin becomes digital gold and another crypto figures out how to be the currency?

Not sure what you mean. I didn't state anything as an absolute; just pointing out what I am looking for in a cypto-currency. I think the transactional currency part is key to giving the store of value part it's meaning. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:12:55
Exactly right. Furthermore, if the 2mb hardfork part of the agreement is reneged on, a giant percentage of the hashrate will move to the recently forked chain. The btc chain will slow to even more of a crawl leaving one chain that works (quickly and with low fees the way Satoshi intended it to work). 
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:52:34
This. Keep that seed safe and private for this reason. Anyone can take your coins if they have it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:16:58

@_date: 2017-08-10 16:50:02
Good reply, thanks.
I know it seems insane, but yes, eventually, one global ledger for all transactions. Think about computing advances in the last 20 years. Quantum computers are coming down the pipe. Big important networks, traditionally, have shown they can scale. The idea of 4k movie streaming on the internet in 1994 would have been called insane too.
I agree with you on 2LN for the privacy thing but you'd still be trusting a 3rd party in the same way we trust VPN providers who say they don't log traffic. I'm sure there will also be big address mixing services for privacy.
Bitcoin solved problems that many people thought were impossible; yet here we are.

That's the thing, given a low mining difficulty and a percieved market value in the other chain (ie price stays high), it could potentially be profitable.

We're talking about currency and free markets; percieved and potential counts for a lot.
All I'm saying is if the New York agreement isn't followed through on with a 2mb hardfork, things get interesting. I'd definitely hodl my b c h.
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:37:15
You can get 2 terrabytes these days for less than $80.00.
Networks traditionally scale. There were a lot of people back in the day saying there was no way the internet could handle more than 50mb files. We're now watching 4k Netflix. 
Plus not every node needs to be a full node. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:23:42
Thanks. Yes that part looks user friendly. But to get my btc on a lightning network I have to pay the transaction fee. We're already at $1-$2US so $5-$10 fees by the time lightning is ready is probable. To get my $100 worth of btc on a lightning network and off again is going to cost me $10 - $20.
I suppose I could put a larger amount of btc on the lightning network and just leave it but how is that different from a bank?

@_date: 2017-08-07 22:21:34
It was required two years ago. Seriously, a simple 2mb hardfork would have proved the community can rally behind a hardfork and prevented the stupid civil war we have now. It would have given teams working on lightning the time to implement it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:54:02
Just saying there are a lot more players involved in the bitcoin ecosystem than core devs.
Core devs have not negotiated in good faith with miners and they have completely ignored users requests for lower fees and fast transactions.
With actual consensus building we would have had a hard fork to 2mb years ago... This would have bridged the gap to SegWit ( keeping fees low) and prevented the ugly split we now see in the Bitcoin world.
Instead, in my opinion, core is completely dogmatic and forces their philosophy on others. This is the opposite of consensus.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:08:23
You know that that the core devs have actively campaigned for high on chain fees right? Right or wrong, a high fee main chain Bitcoin is their philosophy.
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:11:59
It would have sped up transactions and reduced fees with very little risk. Very smart engineers, like the guy Satoshi gave the keys to for example, said it was the way to go. It would have proven the community could come together to make necessary changes to the code. It would have kept the community together. It would have bought time to implement lightning or other solutions without so much drama. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:05:17
"So the core devs came to the consensus" 
Umm... That's not really consensus
@_date: 2017-04-13 16:52:36
Technology historically scales. Whether it's phone lines, computer chips, packet networks, etc... . Bitcoin can scale on chain. I think Segwit is a bad, overly complex scaling solution that was put in place only to support third party settlement layers. And that, not coincidentally, just happens to be Blockstream's business model.
@_date: 2016-02-10 19:06:46
@_date: 2017-04-14 04:38:23
Hey, thanks for the reply. I'm glad I haven't been banned for my opinion. 
I don't have a problem with Blockstream making a profit but I do think core developers are hurting Bitcoin by not raising the limit even a little to buy other technology time and, more importantly, as a political sign of good faith. It screams conflict of interest to me to the point that core has completely lost my trust.
Very smart people agree ( Gavin for one; you know, the guy Satoshi gave the keys to; and other computer scientists)that a blocksize increase  up to 8mb would be perfectly safe. All core had to do was raise it to 2mb and this schism could have been avoided.

I'm sorry you're just plain wrong about who you are blaming. Gavin Anderson, you know, the guy Satoshi himself gave control of the project to, warned core about this 2 years ago. Core did nothing. In fact,   core purposely stifled the blocksize. 
This is just so plainly obvious it is aggravating.

@_date: 2017-06-08 17:05:40
Segwit will not solve this issue. Segwit is not designed to solve this issue. If you want Bitcoin to be more than just a settlement layer for large transactions, then it must scale! 
The current core team is preventing this scaling. They want the small transactions happening on third party (i.e. Blockstream) "lightning" networks. Segwit is designed to facilitate this but the lightning networks are not anywhere close to operational.

The more bitcoin can survive these panics (because that is what they are) the stronger it becomes. It will bounce back to the high $40's fairly quickly; making coins for less than $40 a good buying opportunity.
$50 seems like a bit of a barrier and that is probably a good thing for a while. Once it pushes past $50 then who knows where the next stop will be...
@_date: 2013-03-19 23:58:59
I really don't think so. Have you seen the volume of buy orders between $40 and $45. It would take something extremely drastic to knock it back to $30.00.  Even the fork problem, which got publicized drastically, only managed to knock the price from $48 to $35; and then it immediately bounced back.
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:46:53

Agree snakemcgraw! First of all, it was June 2011 and the collapse had to do with a major security breach at MtGox. This was a single event causing widespread panic.
I saw a little panic in the market around Jan 24 this year when the price dropped suddenly from 19 to 15. The fact bitcoin was not only able to survive this panic but totally rebound, bodes well for the currency. It demonstrates a level of confidence that, like snakemcgraw points out, is different this time around.
If this was just a normal investment, I would have already cashed out and been happy with my profit. But this is not just some commodity; it's more like I'm investing in a revolution and that is worth the risk of holding on for the long term.

Thanks for the great reply ferretinjapan. I'm just diving into bitcoin and, although fairly technical, it's pretty damn fascinating. 
After reading up a bit (including this thread:  I'm left with the impression that raising the limit (or removing it completely) is the only viable option. The sooner the better.
If the limit is not raised then fees will be and small transactions will not be economically feasible. That's not acceptable; one day I'd like to be able to buy a soda, or a piece of gum, or whatever from a street vendor with coins on my phone... if bitcoins can't do this it's not a proper currency.
So... does raising the limits or removing them constitue a "hard fork"? Is a hard fork such a terrible thing? If so, why? Will a hardfork affect the average person (non technical) that is already holding bitcoins?

Ultimately, it's the Federal Reserve and central banks that worry me. They won't give a shit about free markets and the logic of US business interests when their power; control over the money supply; is threatened. 
Just how much influence central banks can hold over governments and mainstream media in this matter remains to be seen. 
It is great that the bitcoin foundation is doing everything possible to play nice with government regulators but I feel like all bitcoin enthusiasts should be prepared to weather (and ultimately overcome) central bank resistance that could potentially be harsh.

Do you know when Coinlab is supposed to take over from Mt. Gox? What effect do you think this will have? More institutional investors?

Sold at $25... thought it was going to $20 then thought it was going to stabilize at $22... then saw it bounce back over $25... decided to put in orders at $24 and hold... .so basically, I made a bunch of money for my exchange ;P.
Chart patterns suggest that after this drop, it will steadily rise again.
The more bitcoin manages to stabilize itself after these heard mentality panics, the stronger it will be in the long run.

CaVirtex fees are f***ing ridiculous. I was on today's sell off and sold at 25 just before the crash.. I bought in a little late when it was bouncing back too fast but still managed to buy at 23, 24 and 24.50.
Bottom line: I made over $100 in fees for CaVirtex and made absolutely no money myself.
Lesson learned: panicked day trading is a fools game.

The comparison with Napster and bitcoin is bogus. Napster relied on a central name server that users logged into. There is nothing comparable with bitcoin; nothing central that can be shut down.

This cannot be overstated enough and is actually a good life lesson. Actions based in fear will almost always have negative consequences.

Back the charts out 6 months or even 30 days and relax. Old coin holders are going to be taking some profits. New coin holders, if you panic, you will lose money. I learned this lesson back durring the "drastic" crash from $19 to $15.
New normals (high $80's?) need to be established and then the march upward will continue. Breaking 100 might take some time... I hope it does... but I'm expecting a rise to at least $120 fairly soon....

yes, but after 180 days, do your fees reset to 3%? 
How much volume do you need to buy/sell to maintain that?
MtGox's highest fee is .6%  (It's just that it's a pain in the ass to get money there from Canada)
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:40:30
I don't get why it should fall? Nothing fundamentally has changed. Yes, the run up to $200 was ridiculous but, thinking long term, $80 bitcoins are good value. I'd like to see it settle around $100... a good psychological number to rest at for a while so that the bitcoin economy can grow.
As the btc economy grows, so will the value; slowly and steadily.
@_date: 2013-03-07 15:05:22
Can anyone share why there is a hard cap in the first place. And why would raising this to 100mb or even a gigabyte be "bad"? 
@_date: 2013-03-13 19:21:17
The corrections happen in the form of flash crashes of about 10%. But the amazing thing in this run is that the price has been bouncing back almost immediately. The price bounces back and then marches upwards. It tends to slow down (thankfully because spiking prices are scary) towards psychological barriers like $20, $32(the previous all time high before the last major crash), and now $50. 
The resiliency demonstrated in the recent flash crash due to the chain fork hiccup suggests a major correction is unlikely and that the upward march will continue... 
Watch it in the high $40's for a while; if no major bad news comes, it will start to break through the $50 barrier. After that, I'm not sure where the next psychological barrier would be... possibly $100. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 02:29:05
Totally agree. At first i thought the people wishing for the price to stop shooting up were crazy but now i get it. The fundamentals need to catch up to the hype. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:43:47
On the one hand you should treat this as any high risk investment. If you are not willing to lose your money then don't invest it. 
On the other hand, Bitoin has the opportunity to be paradigm changing. If we all start to simply agree that it has value (which is happening before our eyes), then it has the potential to become MASSIVE. Even a small percentage of Visa's or Paypal's pie makes a bitcoin worth hundreds? thousands? tens of thousands? 
This isn't just hype either; our current fiat based money system is broken and corrupted. The fundamentals of a crypto currency in the internet age just makes sense.
So, in sum, it's a risk but a risk with MASSIVE reward potential.
Oh.. one more thing...besides just being an investment that can make you wealthy, the positive social implications for the average person who gains more control over her money are MASSIVE also. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:43:15
Yeah. You're totally right. I made a couple of hundred today but it really wasnt worth the stress and the risk.
 I just sold some coins to get to a point I'm  comfortable with if it all went to shit. I think im done day trading. Just going to ride it out and hold until bitcoin gets established in the world; something I truly want to see happen.

I was conveying information from  and also from the chat on 
While I couldn't write a detailed essay on the topic of block chains forking and how that happened, I could understand that the problem was under control and was fixable in a matter of hours. I felt that needed to be conveyed in a somewhat technical way. Admittedly, saying the blockchains would "merge" was incorrect language and I'm not sure where I got that from; but, the headline "Don't worry" wouldn't have been very effective.
In general, I hear what you're saying; this was a special circumstance.

In very general terms it's an opportunity to take the power of money out of the hands of big banks and government and put it back into the wallets of individuals. 
A crypto currency is going to be the future of trade. And, right now, bitcoin is the best bet to be that currency.

This is a valid point.  The post modern ideal that everyone is as important as everyone else and that everyone gets a say is good to a point.  BUT when shit gets real and decisions need to be made, strong, unilateral, leadership is required. Ideally this leadership will weigh all the viewpoints but it inevitability must decide on certain viewpoints being BETTER and act.

Who makes the decisions to change how bitcoin works? 
I definitely think it's important that bitcoin tech has the ability to adapt but everything I read says bitcoin isn't controlled by anybody. Is there an organization who can implement something like a cryptography change or any other change? 
@_date: 2013-07-04 13:33:07
Agree. At this point and time, BitPay is extremely important. We are still a long way off from where a merchant can re-use bitcoin for business expenses. Until then, BitPay is the bridge that allows business to begin adoption.

I hear you that there was a possibility of a double spend.

Check out the current bid/ask chart above. The $30 pay walls are gone. Does it not look like a wave of bids ready to overtake the asks?  
With that kind of volume ready to buy I just do not see a major crash happening again. (unless there is some kind of bad news/ press that really scares people)

All I'll say is that im definitely NOT a big player. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 02:56:17
Both times the $60 floor has been tested, it's been because of a flash crash and both times it's bounced back up. The fundamentals are way too strong for the price to drop to $15. Saying it'll drop to $15 is just wild, baseless, speculation. Or do you have some analysis that supports this claim?

My understanding is that having clients forced to upgrade would have been risker (than downgrading); it would have also taken a lot longer to get everyone on .8, prolonging the problem.

Yes it was a big drop (and quick recovery) but it underscores my point that a drop below $30.00 is not likely.

dude... have you even looked at a chart... the support between $60 and $50 is huge... to say it'll dip to $15 is ridiculous (unless a major, unforeseen, technical flaw is found).
Furthermore, the long term fundamentals are amazing; legit banks coming on board in germany, legit mobile phone companies embracing bitcoin in Africa, not to mention the inherent problems with fiat money that continues to be printed faster than it could literally grow on trees.
