Thanks for the tip. I’ll check it out.

My thoughts exactly. I decided to look for a different exchange when I saw the post about Coinbase shutting off sell orders when BTC hit 17k. Ain’t nobody got time for that.

I appreciate it. 
This has been quite the experience, to say the least. I definitely dove in head first, learning on the fly all about how the exchanges worked and eventually becoming a gdax fiend. I couldnt stop watching it during the crash/“recovery” last week. So very fascinating! 
My parents were all concerned about how much money I’d put in already, but I told em... I’m an experiential learner. I won’t learn unless I have skin in the game. So far, I’ve lost close to 30% of what I put in, but I’ve learned a heck of a lot of useful information. And I don’t plan to sell anytime soon, so hopefully once the smoke clears and January passes on, some of the value will return to BTC!

*sigh* 
You’re probably right, but at least for the time being it appears to be a good sign.

How? I don’t have any cash in a wallet there and I can’t use my CC.

Direct quote from their website:
“Robinhood Crypto will initially be available to customers in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, and New Hampshire. We plan to add support for more states soon.”

This makes me feel even better about choosing to switch to Gemini regardless of whether they have alerts or not. I’m tired of all the crazy fees and wait times that Coinbase has. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:05:42
Does bitcoin ticker have a mobile app?
I have no idea how to do the programming necessary to create reliable alerts for myself. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:42:43
Pardon my ignorance, but would you care to explain what all this means? 
I am not following. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:27:38
In the most kind and gentle way I know how, and without being misconstrued as a fan of banks per se, may I just point out that it is entirely a matter of personal responsibility to avoid late fees, overdrafts and the like. We can not fault banks for charging their customers. In fact, they ought to. 
You have a better point with ATM limitations and APR, but they do exist for a reason. And the banking industry is not entirely united on that front. Many local banks exist which do not impose exorbitant APR. Some even offer ATM fee refunds (mine does).

Can anyone tell me why my Coinbase alerts didn’t fire?
I freely admit that I’m a newcomer to these parts. Also freaking out a little bit right now, just like the rest of you. 
But my real question is, why the heck is the Coinbase app not honoring the alerts I set up? I had multiple alerts that should’ve fired all the way down into this shithole we're currently heading headfirst into. 
I figured it was useless to try to send an email to Coinbase customer service. Not worth their time or mine. So..... anyone got any clues/fixes?
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:59:18
Dang, some folks are feeling confident out there! I would’ve loved to see those orders come through. 
I just wish I could justify buying this dip. I bought the last one, but I’m already a little over-invested as is. Best to refrain. 
Though... if it went down to 8k as some predicted it would, I would’ve been buying nonetheless ��
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:59:00
Aaaaaand Coinbase suspends purchase orders for BTC. 
Typical. 
Can’t wait to leave them behind.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:50:29
Point taken. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:31:54
Should be able to go ahead and verify your account now and be able to buy. 
If you use your bank account, it takes 7-10 days for you to actually get your coin, so you won’t be able to sell it for a while, but the price will be locked when you buy it. Buying with a CC will make the coin available immediately, but you pay a lil more in fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:42:52
I say what I’m about to say since no one else has thought to advise you of this, and because I’m assuming you’re asking because you want to buy this dip:
Good luck getting set up with an exchange (any exchange, it won’t matter which you choose) in time to buy this dip. You have to verify your identity on most exchanges, and you’ll definitely have to verify your bank account. The micro transactions they deposit in your account for verification purposes took 3-5 days to appear on my bank statement. So... Unless your bank is very speedy about posting transactions, it may not work out for ya. 
I hope it does! i just felt like you deserved to know  that it’s not as easy as going to Coinbase, signing up with an email address and slapping your Visa info in there. It takes some time. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:32:32
Perhaps I should amend my statement to say that I am over-invested for my own comfort level lol. I’m under &lt;$1000, 
I’ve never bought a stock in my life, never traded anything and only became interested in crypto (and even then, only BTC and ETH) because a friend told me about it. I picked an extremely volatile time to enter the market. As I began to test the waters, my ignorance led me a little further into the deep end than I am perhaps comfortable being in. 
I’ll be fine.

Coinbase is back. Got an order in for $100 at 11.5
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:30:49
Gotta start somewhere I suppose. 
Maybe they were thinking about regional representation? 
You’ve got the east coast with MA and NJ, west coast with CA, Pacific Northwest with MT, and a *very* peripheral member of the southeast in MO. 
And then again it could’ve been about which states had the lowest barrier-of-entry from a policies/procedures standpoint. Who am I kidding though... California would never qualify for that lol
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:55:23
����‍♂️ I’m not buying it. I had alerts set up at several thresholds between the current price and the recent peak at 17k that should’ve fired and they didn’t. The market wasn’t in freefall either. 
You’re right that a decently written program should have no trouble processing loads of requests, regardless of how much trading volume is occurring. Like... am I supposed to believe that executing a price alert is extraordinarily resource intensive in terms of computing power? Nah. 
What I’m saying is I believe that they’re suppressing alerts in hopes that fewer people panic sell. Like I said earlier, I’m very new to this sub and bitcoin as a concept, so... even though I’m probably a little over-invested right now due to overzealousness, I’m going to just hodl and see what happens. I’m treating it as a learning experience. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:29:33
Hopefully by the year 2020 we can all feel better about those I’ll-advised FOMO buys (my own included).
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:47:21
I don’t think so, unfortunately. 
That’s exactly what I’ve been doing. I’ve been buying with my bank-issued debit card that is managed by Visa. 
I think the system just sees it as a Visa and goes with it. Fees applied by the system according to the credit card fee scale. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:47:39
Did anyone else just see someone buy 60BTC in one transaction? I wish I had 660k to throw around like that.
Suddenly a huge green candle appears!

Will further fees be assessed if I make transfers from coinbase —&gt; coinbase pro? (To State the question differently... are fees assessed both ways, anytime you’re transferring from one to the other, even though they’re the same company???)
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:32:25
But that's the thing though... They said it would be free when I transferred from Pro to coinbase, yet here I am missing some BTC... 
I would love to transfer my balance to coinbase pro from coinbase so as to avoid fees when I decide to sell, but I'm not gonna do that if they're gonna assess fees every time I move it around, know what I mean? 
Sorry, I'm just frustrated that somehow some of my BTC disappeared

Returning BTC hodler here with some questions about selling. 
Back in 2017 when I first learned about BTC I got a Coinbase account to play around. Ended up fiddling with GDax back then too. I’ve patiently hodl’d all this time and am now considering selling some. 
I had some BTC hanging out on GDAX before it turned into Coinbase Pro. I wanted to move it to my Coinbase wallet for quick selling, so I did that earlier tonight. Only thing is... I suddenly have less BTC. It comes out to ~$30 that I lost. I know it’s not a lot, but... the transfer screen said it would be fast and free. It was fast, but does not appear that it was free. What sucks is I was only transferring an amount roughly equivalent to $100... so that’s like 30%, which makes me mad. 
Can anyone explain where that extra little BTC went? And WHY?
Edit: I mean 30% lost in fees, if that’s truly what happened. (No fees were displayed to me up front)
