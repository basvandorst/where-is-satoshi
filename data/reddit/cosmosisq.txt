[Nakamoto consensus?](
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:45:05


What's wrong with proof of stake? What makes proof of work any better? What's wrong with Ethereum? What makes Bitcoin any better?


Let me hear some of your ideas so I can judge you.
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:24:36
Out of curiosity, what are the two ~$0.50 transactions from Factom for?
@_date: 2017-03-28 03:47:09
No need to whine and scream. You seem to be misunderstanding the concept. Nakamoto consensus is the mechanism by which SHA256 proof of work conflicts are resolved. It is also the mechanism by which client conflicts are resolved. In fact, it is the mechanism by which *all* blockchain conflicts are resolved. Clients, nodes, and miners aren't "in" Nakamoto consensus, they utilize it. Likewise, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin XT, or any other client cannot "leave" Nakamoto consensus. They all rely upon Nakamoto consensus to function, and Nakamoto consensus dictates that the longest proof of work wins.
However, at this point, we're just arguing semantics. Let me try and help you understand my point in mentioning Nakamoto consensus in the first place. Many consider Nakamoto consensus to be the spirit of Bitcoin. As a mechanism, it highlights the ideology which birthed Bitcoin in the first place, and I think that might explain why Bread Wallet, the Winklevoss ETF, and many other institutional structures choose to follow the longest chain. By its original definition, the longest chain *is* Bitcoin.
I'll help you out with some of the counterarguments so you don't become overwhelmed with frustration and resort to insults again. It's a perfectly valid statement that Bitcoin has evolved, and its definition has changed. In this case, the traditionalists might be regressives. To blindly follow old ideologies is a logical fallacy, after all. However, placing trust in a consensus mechanism *does* make logical sense considering the effectiveness of natural selection. If you don't agree with this statement, then why do you choose to utilize a trustless, decentralized platform in the first place?
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:01:35
First, thank you for the calmer response this time around. I'm "trying to waste [your] time arguing" because I want to understand your idea of what Bitcoin was, is, and should be. I also want you to understand why I brought up Nakamoto consensus as you reacted with fairly irrational opposition to my original comment.


Unless we have a different understanding of the rules, I think we're in agreement here. Can you explain to me what "the established rules" are as you know them?


We were arguing about the definition of consensus and the definition of Bitcoin, right? That's literally an argument about [semantics.]( If I'm understanding you correctly, you believe that Nakamoto consensus is limited to handling invalid blocks due to calculation errors. I believe that Nakamoto consensus involves the handling of all cases in which blocks may be determined invalid by miners, nodes, and users. Based on what they have said, I think this is the interpretation of Nakamoto consensus and Bitcoin that Breadwallet has taken. Continuing this argument will not make either of us any wiser as, like you said, we "completely disagree."


Huh? I'll try and restate what I was saying more concisely. In a very general sense, the [traditional definition]( of Bitcoin is the blockchain meeting Nakamoto consensus. In other words, it is the blockchain supported, utilized, and verified by the majority of miners, nodes, and users. Naturally, this will end up being the longest chain as miners build on top of it, nodes discard alternative blocks, and users continue to use it.
Now, I personally recognize that definitions are subject to change. Has the definition of Bitcoin changed? I don't know. I don't think so, but I really don't know. I think it's in the process of changing.


Unfortunately, yes. That's how Bitcoin currently works.


I agree with everything in bold with a corollary: the market is not the sole definer. If the chain supported by the market has no miners and nodes to keep it running, it will fail. In that vein, I don't think the latter part of your statement has been proven yet. I don't think it *can* be proven until a hard fork actually happens and the market makes its choice. How else could we observe the market?
@_date: 2017-03-21 06:37:00
...market-based consensus doesn't sound like Bitcoin to you? How do you think transaction fees are calculated?
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:06:27
A fork requires consensus. How the hell is that centralized?
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:07:34


Irrelevant semantics, although I do agree with you. "Exploiter" makes more sense considering they took advantage of a bug rather than breaking any systems. Then again, how else do hackers break systems? Most exploit bugs, right? Anyway, back to what we're actually talking about.


The highly centralized Ethereum community? Do you know what an oxymoron is? Ethereum is decentralized amongst the community in the same way that Bitcoin is, and thus the Ethereum community itself is decentralized as the Bitcoin community is. There are people who own Ethereum all over the world, rich and poor. When the DAO fork was proposed, 97% of Ethereum owners voted for it with their coins and hashrates. The 3% that voted against it live on in the surprisingly successful Ethereum Classic. The whole thing was very democratic, as were its results.


If the community hadn't reached that consensus, nothing would have happened. The Ethereum Foundation developers have as much power over Ethereum as the BitcoinCore/BitcoinUnlimited developers have over Bitcoin—that is to say, **none**. When the Bitcoin community finally reaches consensus over whether to support BC+SegWit or BU+FlexTrans, will you call it a centralized system? No, of course not, because you're a human being with a working brain, and that wouldn't make any sense. "Community consensus" and "decentralized governance" are almost synonymous.

Umm... What? I'm sorry, but do you know what consensus is? Transaction fees are determined via market consensus in a way very similar to how the price of Bitcoin is determined (although, still altogether different; I can't think of an apt analogy). Miners fill their blocks with whoever is paying the highest fees since they'd like to make a profit. However, it is in a user's interest to pay lower fees since, after all, money holds value. At the same time, paying a higher fee means a better chance of getting their transaction processed sooner. So, eventually, some sort of balance is reached based on what the market determines to be the value of a transaction. In other words, this determination is made out of a consensus between users.
Bitcoin, from top to bottom, was born from and thrives upon consensus mechanisms. Bitcoin, along with many of the cryptocurrencies it inspired, rely upon consensus to secure and grow themselves.

They don't let you use debit, but they'll let you link a bank account (and they make it fairly easy, too, by using your bank's account management API rather than identification numbers and whatnot). It's all ACH and wire transfers.
You'll need photo identification and proof-of-address for verification. While the rules may seem restrictive, you can contact customer support and they'll offer any number of alternatives. I personally never submitted a utility bill, for example.
The fee on all buy and sell orders is 0.25%.

[No, SegWit alone would not compromise bitcoin's security.]( However, SegWit alongside any substantial block size increase (I'm talking &gt;&gt;10 MB) would be a disaster due to the exponential growth of the segregated witness data. The Bitcoin blockchain could be spammed to hell. In the future, if anyone wanted to substantially increase the block size, SegWit would have to be completely overhauled, if not replaced. For this reason, those over in the [BU camp]( are working on alternative transaction malleability solutions like [Flexible Transactions, or FlexTrans.]( But again, SegWit alone is still a secure solution.
**TL;DR: SegWit = OK, BU = OK, SegWit + BU = BAD, FlexTrans + BU = ???**

You should probably try mining a cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin if you want to start seeing a profit sooner. However, if you simply want to contribute to Bitcoin's hashpower to secure the network, more power to you!

Just did some web searching, and I couldn't find anything about ChinaBU. Is ChinaBU even a real thing? Or is it some politically charged misnomer like Blockstream Core? Assuming it's the latter case, I had difficulty finding any websites or articles specifically addressing how Bitcoin Unlimited destroys the fundamental properties of bitcoin with regard to censorship resistance, robustness, permission freedom, and immutability. Could you link me to something?
[On the other hand, I was able to find information about the "President of ChinaBU," as you call it. Their proposed elected representative system is definitely super weird.]( Sounds like things could get very centralized very quickly considering hashpower is the only mechanism for voting. Code improvements would be implemented very slowly as well. Then again, I suppose it's a step in the right direction? Right now, BIPs are merged at the whim of unelected maintainers. That, too, could get very centralized very quickly.

One of the primary reasons I moved the majority of my money to Bitcoin back in 2014 was because of how easy it was to spend and receive money. I was sending payments like emails. Transaction fees are high because bitcoin is becoming centralized, because a monopoly has formed over both its development and its production. A select few miners own the production, and a select few developers own the code.
Prices climb in the absence of competition; it's basic economics.
