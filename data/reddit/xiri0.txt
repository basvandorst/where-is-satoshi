After send it,  you computer doesn't matter in the transaction,  so the problem was when you send it,  or,  like one time I try make a transaction and never was send but still can't  use it,  later, I don't now,  some days, and the problem fixed  itself

If you gonna lose your money without no clear reason,  if you have to send documents proving you are you, the banks do better,  you have more guarantee over you money, if you use bitcoin and still have the same issues like using PayPal there is no point. Use green address,  mycelium,  and there are many exchanges,  today there is plenty.

Is not a good idea, since bitcoin gain value for design, your income pretty sure doesn't, so even if the interest is better than a common bank loan , you gonna pay more money,  you don't know when bitcoin gonna be more value, or lose it.

That is not true either,  even for historical reason. The gold was used for exchange for many centuries and also gain value through the time.  Is bad mix a inflationary economy with a deflationary economy in the borrow matter,  in fact is very good for lenders of other way of exchange. The trick is you shouldn't borrow deflationary money if your income is in a inflationary money  and only in that case.  In my personal case I can take debt in bitcoin without care,  because i have a income in bitcoin so if it gain value I am increase my income in dollar and the same time the debt increase and is no harm in there.

If you are in Russia you have a problem you can't buy bitcoins there,  that I hear,  I found a way you can buy until 6000 usd in bitcoins with  a additional step, and no much trouble,  buying objects of a online game and then selling it for bitcoins. But in cash have additional problem for this I guess.
