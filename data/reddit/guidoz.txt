I'm sure not *all* the downvotes are bots, but the majority of them likely are.

Look at the time frame - posted that 4 hours before canton's comment you linked.

This seems fairly cool. I'll give it a shot!

**::EDIT::** Some quick PHP security checks show no common flaws. Carry on.

My computer repair business uses it.

Same issue here, and I'm VERY well versed in BTC and social media. =) (I even tweeted on my own, even though I couldn't run through it either.) Wouldn't register the tweet, though it did Facebook, but I couldn't get past the same step. Tried FF and Chrome (latest).

And the "support page" goes to a "this domain is for sale!" site instead.

Though my setup isn't anything like yours, I also switched over to Mt Red! Thanks for the advice.

You're a gentleman and a scholar. I'll be sure to pass it on!

Thanks for spreading the love. It's important to let as many people as possible participate.

Now I'm with you. That's friggin awesome by the way! Time to go spend more BTC. :-)

Great story! Being a techie myself, I'm frequently the one being peppered with questions. Educating the general public, especially customers, is one BIG thing I'm known for. I gave up trying to convince people that BitCoin was a good thing a year ago. That is, until a few weeks ago.
I had a customer nonchalantly ask me if I accepted payment in BTC. (They actually said "BTC". I think it was a test.) After a second of realizing what they said, I replied with "of course!" They tipped me $20 (at the current rate), which has now grown to even more. I used the tip to order some "Pay with BTC!" stickers for the office. =D

So let me get this straight. I (recently, like a few days ago) purchased an Amazon gift card with Bitcoin. Say that gift card was $1000 - I just earned 30 Gyft Points, because you're back-dating it? If you say "YES!" you just earned yourself another purchase. =D
::EDIT:: Wait, I'm confused by the math. It says both "3% back in points" AND "3 points per $1 spent" - so how many points would a $1,000 Amazon gift card earn? (I was a lucky one and had a bunch of Bitcoins from the $17/BTC days. I'm laughing at all the haters because I have more in BTC than they do in life savings. While it's high, time to cash in for a bit.)
