Paypal is on board, the same way for example one could say PETA is onboard with McDonalds. There is no certainty (or even solid suggestion) that this will make it what we typically call Paypal wallet, at the moment is a project of some PMs at braintree prompted briefly, albeit with some optimism, by a VP in the parent. Whos know with the PP/Ebay split? 
tl;dr - BrainTree (relatively small crippled merchant account provider - similar to WorldPay) partnered with 3 BT exchanges to allow some customers (using payment hub) to accept BitCoin. The press prompted it as Paypal because Paypal now own Braintree a VP/CEO at the parent gave a statement for the press release..

The scamees as you put it, perhaps have no have malicious intent, they may at this moment in time believe in it (despite the evidence), Ive seen similar in timeshare, no matter how blatantly obviously they've been mis-sold (ranging from complete deception to prices paid that could purchase the same unit freehold) many, in order to protect their pride convince themselves their deal is different/better/unique.  People (inclusive of ourselves) are strange.  Note: Im not familiar with Hashtalk or the Paycoin disaster (apart from little bits here and there), just sharing a thought..
