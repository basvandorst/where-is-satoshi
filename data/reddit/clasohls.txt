According to your other post it's been 24 days. It's still very unacceptable but I don't think saying a different number of days in different posts helps.

Microsoft or Facebook have never seen their stock rise 1500% in a single year either, so why would he call them bubbles? He sticks to the logic that if he can't understand the value behind a company or a product then he's not going to invest in it.
Bitcoin is a disruptive innovation with the potential to make banks obsolete and disrupt the entire financial sector, which I'm pretty sure goes against what many people thinks is possible.

Doesn't apply to anyone except developers (of which there are probably many here) but just want to chime in there and say that the team behind Visual Studio Code at MS is definitely what I would consider wayleaders.
Never had a development tool before that's so easy to set up, use and configure as VS Code.

Yup! Had a similar "Ooooh" moment when I realized that.

I think you're right and the potential for blockchain is what excites me, but the decentralized consensus protocol behind it that no state or company stands behind just represents a complete sense of ownership to me in a way that fiat just doesn't.
In Sweden we're just now in the cooldown phase of the largest real estate bubble we've had so far in this country largely because of fractional reserve banking, reckless expansion and irresponsible lending. My money and everybody else's contributed to that whether we liked it or not.
I'd like to apply this sense of ownership to whatever kind of valuable thing I currently own.

Right now, yes. But the decentralized consensus based nature of it is not and it's impossible to have a scalable Bitcoin 2.0 without first running Bitcoin out in the wild and solve the issues you come across.

Mostly because it creates a catchy headline and because it's already been done when the combined values exceeded Facebook. I don't think people one the outside understand cryptocurrencies enough to realize that the altcoins are very different in their implementation.

When have we ever had a decentralized currency before?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:17:50
If it crashes it's a steal though!

People were convinced the Internet had no value either because you would never be able to search for anything. Then came Google. Andreas Antonopoulous keeps rephrasing that as he travels around the world he hears about businesses with remarkable ideas for Bitcoin and there are so many use cases that we don't even know about yet.
Therefore I'm less worried about its current use and optimistic about its future use.

And the rarity of it.

Feels like you have a pretty solid foothold so there's no need to sell as long as you're in the green. I've been buying around the $9.000 to $16.000 range and started selling when indicators were pointing towards the fact that we were not going to reach 20k levels again anytime soon. It made me really uncomfortable holding on to a losing asset when I knew that I could sell now and buy back at a cheaper price, so that's why the HODL mentality feels a bit dangerous to me.

Derp! You're right, thank you.

It really doesn't need a payment capacity. If the transition from gold -&gt; Bitcoin takes so long, it doesn't make sense that they would just swap to the next best thing a few years afterwards.
However, over a longer period of time it could definitely happen if Bitcoin doesn't evolve like other currencies do.

HODLing is only fun if you came in late and want to wait X amount of years. I did the same thing as you and I'm in the plus now while people that bought in at the same time and HODL'ed is in the red.

Doesn't there have to be an equal long to your shorts? Who would go long on Kodak? People who believe this will make them relevant again?

Because an online dictionary that's free to use totally doesn't deserve money.

The owner of a Swedish BTC purchasing service actually did this (albeit for a Tesla Model X) as well as Bitcoin socks, then participated in articles showing them off. He's of course still a target by being the owner of the service, but to me it seems like putting an unnecessarily big target on your back.

DataDash is unabashedly bullish, even in this bear market which makes his TA and price calls too biased. The advisors that should be listened to are the ones that actually dare to be bearish, despite the fact that bearish videos get fewer views and fewer comments. My favourite example of this is Randy at Real-Crypto.
I enjoy DataDash because his videos are not entirely focused on TA, but instead a nice mix between looking at the charts and listening to current events in crypto. For the laughs I go to Doug Polk every day of the week.
