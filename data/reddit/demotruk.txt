I think the only benefit of this is that it reminds people why Bitcoin exists (ie. it is a form of digital cash which is quite hard to seize or be devalued by forces other than market demand). It won't help the Greeks much because their money is still in the banks where it can still be seized, it would only have helped those who got into bitcoin ahead of time.
The other theory is that the eurozone as a whole will experience inflation as a result of this, which I'm not really sure of myself. What happens when the IMF gets a (huge) bad debt, as it will in the case of Greece? I understand the IMF has it's own treasury bonds it has to pay, and it is effectively financed mostly by the US.

Really depends on your country/region. Try find out if there's a bitcoin ATM near you, so that you can buy with cash.
If you're in the US, there might be a LibertyX retailer somewhere near.
If you have a bank account or credit card, there are various options like Coinbase, Kraken.com or Circle.com
If all else fails, try localbitcoins.com. But make sure you know what you're doing so that you can avoid being robbed or scammed.

I don't think anyone expected Bitcoin to fulfill all financial use-cases without stuff being built on top of it. There has been nothing like Changetip before because there has been nothing like Bitcoin to enable it. In my opinion calling Changetip a failure of bitcoin is like saying that HTTP is a failure of IP.
I agree that decentralized systems could be superior, but Changetip is the first system doing what it does, thanks to Bitcoin and bringing attention to bitcoin.  We can now do stuff that wasn't achievable before, and it brings attention and adoption to Bitcoin. That's all good, IMO.

The biggest issue isn't technical, it's a matter of incentive. You have to give them a reason to want to pay you with Bitcoin. How would you normally be paid? If the client normally pays fees, then you could ask them if they'd be willing to pay in Bitcoin and tell them how it will mean less fees. If the fees are normally on your side (such as with PayPal), then you may need to offer to reduce the price if they pay with bitcoin.
As for the invoice itself, simplest thing to do would be to use the Coinbase invoice service.
Alternatively I'd share a public key from Mycelium and a picture of the QR code, but that's less straightforward.
The next thing is how they actually buy bitcoins. That will depend heavily on where they are based.

Bitcoin is going to be very volatile for a long time. If that's not for you, I suggest getting out and taking a look again in a few years. With increased adoption we will see lower volatility in the long run, but it's a hurdle before you can treat bitcoin as a practical currency.
There are some reasons to hold or use bitcoin despite the volatility, but they may not apply to you now. Watch this space, basically.

Usually politicians use terrorism, paedophiles etc. for that purpose. Making a claim like this about the economy is a big step further, because of the impact it has on confidence.
I see three possibilities, and only one of them seems reasonably likely to me:
1. Cameron doesn't think his statement risks a self fulfilling prophecy. I find this highly unlikely, savvy politicians are very deliberate about what they say on these issues and know what impact they can have.
2. Cameron doesn't mind damaging the economy as long as he politically benefits (whether through approval or pushing through policies they want). Again, I find this highly unlikely. A recession always hurts political leaders seriously, and it will hurt his rich friends too.
3. The information available to him really does show that an economic crash is around the corner and he wants to salvage some political capital by warning us now, so that he doesn't look like Gordon Brown did, totally blindsided by the 2008 crisis. One sub-possibility of this is that he knows the trouble could actually start in the UK, but wants to deflect the fear to the Eurozone so that when it begins he has a go-to line when criticized for his own policies.

Seeing that BitPay is doing over $1,000,000 per day, which is well over 10 times what it was doing the same time last year, I'm pretty bullish too. However I don't think mainstream acceptance is 'just around the corner', but we do seem to be transitioning from phase 1 (entirely speculation and venture capital) to phase 2 (Bitcoin largely used for online transactions, but on the fly, consumers aren't generally holding it). This phase will last many years, I think. Phase 3 would be the inflection point where it is mainstream enough that it becomes worthwhile for people to hold bitcoin for non-speculative reasons, which is when the value of bitcoin could truly explode.

Currently though, receiving bitcoin is not that useful for the vast majority of people. You can't use it at the local convenience store, pub, etc. You need to turn it into cash before it becomes versatile.
Still though, the fees that OP is talking about seem excessive for what is happening here:


Receiver does USD withdraw (pays fee).
Receiver needs to wait a few days for the USD over wire/swift banking system.
Optional: Receiver does a cash withdrawal from bank account. Pay fee.
If you're paying that much to turn bitcoin into cash, it's clearly not going to be worth it for you, IMO. If you're in Europe you should be paying much less than that and the transfers will be very fast. For example, if I sell on Kraken I'll pay about €0.03c miner fee, 0.35% on the sale, withdraw to bank for free, and it will take 1 working day. There'll be a further €0.20 charge when I use the ATM to withdraw cash.
Edit: This is why places like BitSpark can afford to charge such a low rate. There needs to be some degree of a Bitcoin economy on both sides, so it won't work everywhere, but where you have it available, it can be extremely efficient.

In general, I think the spread out tipping is the best thing we can do most of the time. It's pretty viral, many people love receiving a random tip, especially if it's in appreciation for something they did, and brings in new people broadly.
I think if we do a "tip bomb", it should be well planned and targeted. We should all together tip 1 target, get as much money as we can to that one target, so that maybe it can get picked up as a story. We should:
1. make a multiple-vote poll of targets. Anyone can nominate any target, and you can vote for as many options as you like. The top result is the target. The poll can be a Reddit thread counting total upvotes on the comments.
2. ensure that we have enough people involved that we can raise a significant amount of money and noise in doing so. We don't want the 'bomb' to be a dud.

That... does not at all refute the ponzi scheme nature. The cloud mining business model makes no sense except as a Ponzi scheme. Once you've got the hardware the only cost is energy, it makes much more sense to sell those coins for yourself. Ponzi schemes work by making big promises that can be achieved temporarily for early investors, but are totally unsustainable as they require exponential growth of new users. The evidence points much more to that than to actual "cloud mining" operations existing.

Making cash/bank deposits and withdrawals is really painful and awkward, and usually involves expense. Hence paypal's fees and costly exchange rates, as well as the necessary security around a paypal account since they're holding the keys to your credit cards. It also means dealing with all sorts of AML rules and financial regulation.
By dealing with bitcoin, changetip sidesteps all those problems. Admittedly since we're still mostly dealing with a fiat system, if you didn't already have bitcoins before you started using Changetip. But that's a reflection of the problems of fiat, and exchanging it for bitcoin currently.
If Changetip wasn't enabled by Bitcoin, I'd ask why it wasn't done before Bitcoin? The concept is really simple. In my view it's the practical realities of fiat currencies that have prevented it, and the comparison to Paypal shows how much simpler Bitcoin makes it.

That's partly an issue with Twitter, it's a broadcast medium. Sometimes you do something that might seem semi-private, but you're always effectively broadcasting it to the world on a searchable database.
If you thought spam was bad before, online begging is going to be crazy. Yet, at the same time, I think bitcoin may hold the solution to online spam and begging at the same time. It hasn't yet really been approached, but you can have the concept of 'stamps' attached to emails and other private messages from people outside of a whitelist. You can have settings on your email provider that they only process messages if they provide a certain minimum stamp, effectively a small payment for the time you take to look at it.

The two things you will need to do to perform this transaction is:
Create a bitcoin wallet. Google that, you'll find plenty of instructions.
Use a bitcoin escrow service. This is to avoid scams (it's more for the buyer than the seller). More information:
Finally, selling your bitcoins for cash is the harder part. You'll need to sign up with an exchange. LocalBitcoins might be the most straightforward in your case, but other users may have better advice.

Largely agreed, the user experience (maintaining personal security in particular) of bitcoin is definitely going to need to improve for widespread adoption. I don't think that merchant adoption is even going to be the key area for bitcoin adoption though. Buying stuff online is not a huge problem for people, it certainly could be better, more efficient and private, but by and large it's not a major pain point. As with any disruptive technology it's the underserved market that's important. Even there, user experience is going to be extremely important, but the benefits gained are more likely to be valuable in those markets, such that they will put up with the deficits in those areas.
The Microsoft announcement is mostly good in terms of legitimacy, and in bringing attention to a new audience, but by and large I don't think it will be a major driver of adoption simply because it doesn't particularly solve large problems right now.

Hi Jeff,
I can't say how likely it is to take off, this is not a good place to ask that question simply because most of us are very likely to believe it will succeed, by virtue of being here. Many of us have some savings in bitcoin based on that belief, I have a small amount, so we are betting on its success. I personally believe it is close to inevitable, but may take many years.
To your second question, you might get some free PR by posting on here, or maybe a local newspaper. If you get the word out that you accept bitcoin, people who use it will remember, and you may become their first choice. A sign saying that you accept bitcoin would be a must.
In answer to your third question, yes. 1,000,000 bits = 1 bitcoin. The post following mine by the ChangeTip robot allows you to collect the very small amount of bitcoin I tipped you, just to introduce you to the concept.

If you post something along the lines of "why not bitcoin?" without the filling in the dots so that it's clear how it can help, it's pretty useless, as if you don't know much about Bitcoin you need to do a lot of research before you can evaluate how useful it would be to you.

Firstly, talk to him and see what works for him. Anything you do will require some action on his side. Also, what service are you using to email money transfer, PayPal?
One way to do it would be to have him set up an account with Coinbase, and he can send you an invoice every month. He can receive cash instead of bitcoin, but there are fees, I think around 1%. If that's more than the fees usually paid, I doubt he'd be interested.
Another way would be to have him generate 12 paper wallets, one for each month. He gives you the 12 public keys, and you pay the appropriate amount each month (you'll have to agree how to define the rate, perhaps the rate at midnight, so that you don't just wait for a time of day when the price of BTC happens to be lower). He can then sell the BTC on an exchange.
Unless there's a better service than the ones I'm suggesting, I don't think it's appropriate to pay your rent in BTC yet.

@_date: 2014-12-19 13:24:57


Only if all else remains equal. The vast majority of the demand for bitcoin is speculative. Speculative demand is strongly related to psychology. You can kill demand from other buyers by dumping coins in a situation where you have low liquidity. They won't be the only one to sell when that happens, others panic and demand drops.
This sort of activity also kills the potential demand from any buyers who start wanting to get in when they see the currency stabilizing. Stability is an important fundamental for bitcoin, although one that clearly has not yet been achieved. If you can make the price more volatile, you can hurt demand.
I am of course assuming that any such actor is willing to take large losses. Defensive losses against a disruptive competitor. A few million or billion $ for major banks or nation states may not be that much if it is seen as defending their much larger business in the long run. I'd also note that I am talking in the hypothetical, I do not know or believe that this is happening at the moment. I think it is far more likely that the major banks are not putting significant money into fighting bitcoin because they still see it mostly as a joke.
@_date: 2014-11-16 00:17:57
Are you asking an entire community to conform to a viewpoint? I understand subreddits can have a sort of "hivemind", but it's not a *literal* one. There are multiple people in the forum, some will express the first view at times, others will express the latter at times. If you find people being personally inconsistent, I suggest you highlight it to them specifically.
And the two views aren't even necessarily inconsistent. There are different motivations for excitement on this forum. Some are invested in bitcoin, the price is important to them because they are invested in it. Others are simply supporters of bitcoin in general and are arguing that a low price is not necessarily a sign that Bitcoin will fail. The two groups can overlap, and even when they do, it is not necessarily inconsistent. The price can matter for one end (make them money personally in the near term) and not matter for another end (the success of bitcoin long term).

Bitcoin replaces a fraud issue with a theft issue.
I definitely think that bitcoin key theft in the long run will be less of an issue than credit card fraud is, but right now it requires a huge change in mindset for the user to maintain security (as we've seen with blockchain.info, a lot of users aren't ready for this change).
We need to get to the point where you barely have to think about the security of your wallets, because for example a hardware solution makes it that easy, before we can say "just use bitcoin [and your money will be secure]". Every system that we have currently has its security limits, even a brainwallet has limitations.
Multi-sig hardware wallets are likely 'good enough' in terms of security right now, but the average new bitcoin user doesn't go out and buy a hardware wallet, they usually sign up with a web wallet. It needs to be clear to new users that they should get into good habits with their online cash immediately, don't let it be an afterthought.

Really hard to say, the devil is in the details. The important questions I guess are can you make a cheap transfer to a low/no fees exchange in the US, and can you do the same in reverse in Japan. The cost of moving bitcoin between a US exchange and a Japanese exchange would be negligible, but there are 5 points at which you could get hit with fees and you should investigate them and add them up:
1. Transfer of USD to US exchange
2. Purchase of Bitcoin on US exchange (should be free with the right exchange)
3. Transfer of Bitcoin to Japanese exchange (negligible, a few cents at most)
4. Sale of Bitcoin on Japanese exchange
5. Transfer of JPY to Japanese bank
Looking at US and Japanese bank fees online makes me glad to live in the EU...

I agree with the essence of your post, but I would say it's not as simple as that. Bitcoin is currently as safe as you make it. You can learn to use it safely, but you do need to put a lot of thought into your habits and how you keep your keys secure.
We need to have a standard option we can give to a new bitcoin user, which is inexpensive, habits that are simple to learn and easy to apply. I expect it will likely be a mixed hardware/software solution. The solutions may already exist, it could be just a matter of turning them into standards.

I think you're exaggerating the difficulty of taking bitcoin out of an offline wallet. It's not that hard to just take what you need for the day onto your mobile wallet, or for when you're going to use it, and put the rest back into storage.
That said, it is clear that the user experience with bitcoin security still has a way to go. I do think it's possible to store larger sums securely on a mobile device, but presently it requires a degree of diligence and deliberately thinking about your security policies which is somewhat a barrier and not to be expected of the casual user. We have some way to go here, but they are far from unsolvable problems. I don't think it will be that long before we have software and hardware solutions that allow users to be confidently secure in their wallets without having to go to extremes.

I think Youtube celebrities have the most to gain from promoting Changetip (ad revenue is declining, and ads are a crappy way of monetizing Youtube anyway), they'd be a good target. On the other hand, Youtube tipping is still a little awkward for some because of Google+/Youtube account merge issues, it's still in Beta.

The best example I can give is Youtube. The amount of money Youtubers now make per video view is tiny. It was bigger, it's been in decline because as Youtube put video ads in, more and more people have been using adblock, and as a result many popular Youtubers now rely on promotional deals to earn money (which leads to controversy sometimes).


$0.0025 per view is really damn tiny. If tipping took off, it would take 1 in 4 people tipping a single cent to match that. Would you pay a single cent for a video that you enjoyed? I certainly would, and I am willing to bet I'm not alone. I really believe the problem with online monetization has not been that people are unwilling to pay for what is free, but that they are unwilling to go through the process of paying via credit card or paypal for every little interaction they have with the web. Giving 1c, 10c or $1 for an awesome video could become as easy as clicking like and favourite is today.
If the average viewer just payed 1c, that would beat the revenue Youtube is doing overall. One in ten viewers paying 10c is not hard to imagine, if the video is good. I think the ratio could be much better than that in practice.
That leads to a further point. The video has to be good. I have to be glad I watched the video if I am to tip. If I have adblock, but I use tips, you only get money from me if I'm happy. If you made a sensationalist headline but the story didn't match? I'm sorry, no tip for me. The incentive structure has suddenly massively improved. Yes you can get me to click through your thumbnail with a cute girl displaying cleavage, but you won't profit from it.
Everything I say here applies even more to online journalism than Youtube, but tipping exists on Youtube right now, and it may only take a handful of larger channels recognizing the extra revenue potential to start talking about it and promoting it.
Edit: I misunderstood your original post, OP. Check out the stream of tips that followed Stephen Merchant's request for £1 birthday gifts. In general, no, a flood of tips is not something that happens often. Bitcoin tipping is still really really tiny! You won't see huge streams of tiny tips to the same person until:
1. People widely see value in bitcoin
2. It stops being noisy and spammy to do so (ie. it's cleanly integrated into site pages).

This argument seems like nonsense. Right now the active tipping users of ChangeTip is just a few thousand. 1% of a small number is a small number. If ChangeTip ends up being used on a larger scale, especially with users who are likely to withdraw (YouTubers with millions of subscribers accepting tips), we could be talking about very large numbers. That's the potential Pantera Capital is buying into, IMO.

Every time someone buys bitcoin to hold, those are bitcoins that are no longer available to be bought on an exchange. The seller can no longer sell those same bitcoins again. So by the laws of supply and demand, if people put money into bitcoin to hold speculatively, the price rises.
In the long run the use of Bitcoin for buying goods and services is the most important factor, as it is that potential which gives bitcoin speculative value, and why people are buying to hold. But still, just buying and holding on the belief that they will be more valuable and useful in the future can bring the price up, as long as enough people continue to do so at a rate higher than the supply of new coins.

Will be interesting to see what happens with Black Friday.
If there isn't a big increase in traffic, that will be a pretty bad sign. Maybe not doom, but a signal that adoption for actual purchases may still be a long way away.
If there is a big increase in traffic, but the price didn't grow ahead of the sales, that means it's holders getting out. That could also be a bad/mixed sign, because the traders will then sell too, and the price will be badly hit. However if the retailers don't take the volatility hit (such as by using BitPay), it may encourage greater retailer adoption for next year, so possible silver lining.
If the price rises the days ahead of black friday (there may be a big rise on BF itself, with people buying BTC on the fly for their purchase), and there is a big increase in traffic, that's a very bullish sign, even if the price drops after. It means people are buying bitcoin specifically to make purchases, which is very positive for both holders and retailer adoption.
So yeah, I think this week is going to be very important for Bitcoin overall.

It's 2014, 6 years on has everyone forgotten about 2008 already? Our financial system is the problem bitcoin solves.
He may mean consumer applications. Do they not realize just how *badly* the current system works for the internet? Bitcoin is internet cash. It's capable of being vastly more convenient than other online payments.
IRL, I can use cash to buy a newspaper. Simple as that, hand over coins, I have a paper to read. It's a good model, directly between consumer and product provider. On the internet, I have two options, subscribe online by giving my credit card details to every news site I want to use (nobody does that, and for good reason), or go to ad supported sites which pay them a fraction of a cent for each view. These models are rife with problems! The current economics of online news is unsustainable, and Bitcoin opens up new options. That's just one of so many applications. I feel like this guy would have said the same thing about the Internet. We were already able to communicate with people far away, what problems did it solve?

Love this. Upvote Prepare for people completely missing the point and thinking that you're saying "the internet succeeded, therefore bitcoin will succeed". We don't know that Bitcoin will succeed, and it could fail by not reaching broader or mainstream audiences. The point is that paradigm shifts, especially ones that involve significant technical and technological developments, don't simply happen overnight, and it's not expected that every disinterested observer will see the value in it immediately. The network builds upon itself, as it did with the internet, as it did with electricity, as it did with.. heck, the fiat currency system that we have today.

This paragraph is very much a simplification (though I understand it's reasonable to simplify it for the sake of argument). What you pay with Bitcoin is going to be highly dependent on your circumstances, it could be much more or much less than the $2 suggested. For me, I'd pay $0.35 on the exchange I use + $0.03 miner fee. Someone else could pay much more if they don't have easy access to an exchange and/or incur bank fees etc.
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:11:53
Ask him to explain precisely the manner in which it is a Ponzi scheme. People who make this comparison do not seem to have a good idea of what a Ponzi scheme actually entails.
If anything, bitcoin would more closely resemble a *pyramid scheme*, because those who get into Bitcoin earlier have more to gain by getting more people involved. For example if Bitcoin gets to $100,000 per coin, Satoshi would become the richest man in the world, many of us here would be millionaires, and people who got into it later would have much less to gain (in terms of the value of coins alone).
**However**, the increasing value of the coins, the speculation aspect, is only a bootstrap. Once the coins have value to speculators, they have value as a commodity of exchange (and bitcoin is extremely good at that). What starts off as purely speculative becomes real world practical utility. Initially it only has to be used like BitPay, people buy Bitcoin to make a purchase, they make a transaction to someone across the world, and the merchant quickly cashes it in. Volatility doesn't hurt them too much. The more it's used though, the more it will stabilize and become a true currency in the way the USD is today.
That's the hope at least. It could collapse into nothing. For that reason, don't invest anything you can't afford to lose.
Edit: Also, instead of arguing that it's not a Ponzi scheme, argue to get him to allow you a degree of financial responsibility. If you are allowed to try things out for yourself, to a limited degree where you can only lose so much, you can learn about the real world of money and investing, and personal responsibility. Those are valuable lessons, worth it even if you do end up losing a little money in the process.

@_date: 2014-12-02 18:55:14
It's only remarkable in the context of bitcoin's historic volatility. While other currencies are becoming less stable, it has strangely become more stable. It still has a long way to go before it is as stable as a widely used national currency (and personally I believe Bitcoin will be *fundamentally* unstable until it is no longer a primarily speculative investment, and is being used for economic transactions on a very large scale).

Certainly, but from the perspective of the amount of money you put in, you can lose just as much at any price. If I invest $100 when the price is $1000/BTC and it drops to $100 per BTC, I lose $90. If I invest $100 at $100 /BTC and it drops to $10/BTC, I still lose $90.
The only difference with buying in at a lower price is that there's more potential upside (because there is likely a limit to how valuable a bitcoin could become in practice). There's always just as much potential downside, as your investment could *always* go to zero.

Neither are true reflections, both are full of noise. The USD volume chart is probably much more affected by noise than the total transaction volume, because moving large amounts between individual wallets can represent no economic activity but a lot of 'volume' in that chart.

If you buy bitcoin on the fly to use for purchases, it doesn't matter if the price is low. All that matters is that the timeframe you buy and sell in is short enough that you don't get hurt by volatility.

I don't think that's deflationary, it would just be referred to as diminishing growth (of total coins).
I think what's deflationary about bitcoin is two things:
1. In the future the loss of coins will happen at a greater rate than the mining of new coins.
2. The hope is that the market in which bitcoin plays a role will grow faster than the rate of additional coins, in effect being 'deflationary', since there will be a similar amount of coins representing a greater amount of real world wealth.

Depends on your use case. This volatility hurts the main use case of buying bitcoin to use later, the basic currency use case. I don't think we should ignore this present limitation. It's not inherent, and I strongly believe that bitcoin will develop from use cases where this volatility is not such a problem, but for the present, anyone getting into bitcoin should be made aware of the volatility and not expect it to function as a stable currency as of yet.

BitPay transactions are on blockchain.
Last year there was a tonne of buzz about Bitcoin during black friday, clearly not the case right now.

I expect that fractional reserve banking will happen with bitcoin, almost certainly. However, bitcoin is the first currency that allows you to effectively bank while choosing to avoid fractional reserve banks, as a choice. Even if you allow a company to hold your bitcoin on your behalf, it is much easier to ensure and expect transparency of reserves in those institutions within a bitcoin-based economy.
I don't believe that fractional reserve banking in itself is inherently a problem, as long as it's done responsibly and transparently. Fractional reserve banking is a problem in our system mostly because of how it combines with loose monetary policy, to exacerbate asset bubbles caused by excessive liquidity.
Actual cash is a tiny percentage of the money value in the world's economy. I imagine with a bitcoin-based economy, the same would be true to a lesser degree. With an inherently limited monetary supply, the total money available will be more than the total number of actual bitcoins, due to lending, but it would be a much larger fraction of the total available.

Clearly. For the vast majority of Africans right now, if they were to receive bitcoin via twitter, it would be worthless to them. They cannot make use of it or change it into cash. There are some who can, in certain cities, but overall, it would not be worth the effort.
Still. Bitcoin based remittances are happening. Remittances are huge. Airtime remittances have taken off in recent years because, even though they charge high fees, they're *still* dramatically cheaper than Western Union etc., and airtime is something everyone needs. If the airtime remittances companies started accepting Bitcoin, which would be very easy for them to do, they cut out their costs associated with Paypal and credit cards (credit card fraud is a big problem in that area). Fees get lower and they get even more competitive.
Let's imagine this happens, and it's easy for anyone in Africa with a smartphone to purchase their own airtime with Bitcoin, and they're aware of it because their relatives have talked about it. That's a great bootstrapping situation. At this point bitcoin now has real practical value in Africa, and is easily exchanged between smartphone users. It still may not take off as a currency at this point, because it would probably still be too volatile, but that would be the only remaining hurdle.

There are a lot of benefits to using Bitcoin for online purchases if you have access to a low or no-fee exchange.
However, I don't think they will be powerful motivating factors for the average joe you are speaking of. In my view, right now it's only worth it for certain use cases, but as bitcoin becomes more widely used due to those cases, more cases will come up where it becomes worthwhile.
Currently I think the best cases for buying and using Bitcoin are:
1. Buying digitally distributed games. The discount is huge.
2. Remittance. Where the regulation overheads don't keep you out of the market, the savings are huge. Compare BitSpark or BitPesa to Western Union.
3. Tipping. This is just getting started, but I believe that if Youtubers and online publications recognise the potential for extra revenue streams, it could become huge. There is no commitment-free equivalent way to support the services you like online, and let's face it, nobody likes ads.
4. Other online purchases. Not every 'average Joe' is thrifty, but for those who are, there are certainly savings to be made as long as you have easy access to an exchange with low or no fees.
5. Black market (Silk Road et al).

Bitcoin is a conceptual currency, the transaction history of which is stored in lots of computers around the world. They don't exist, anywhere, but you can prove you own some. Bitcoin transactions go to a bitcoin address, which is described by a public key. The public key tells people where they can send bitcoins to you, but there's also a private key which you keep secret. The private key proves that you are the owner of the bitcoins that have been sent to your public key.
Changetip is a service that manages keys on your behalf, creates an account for you, and associates that account with various social network accounts. On those social networks, you can simply type words in comments, and the ChangeTip bot will respond. The bot creates an account for the person you're tipping, and allows them to log in and claim the given bitcoin. They can then withdraw it to their own private address, or sell it on an exchange, or use it at a store that accepts bitcoin, or just tip more and more people.
To demonstrate:

There is no realistic way to make a judgment on this. Since bitcoin is such a speculative market, it depends very heavily on what the market has priced in in anticipation, what the results of the auction are, and especially what bets the traders are making. All I'd say is that the price probably won't sit quietly. It could move either way, in fact it could move a lot in both directions...

I wouldn't be too optimistic yet, BitPay still hasn't announced any BBF numbers, that's not a good sign. Price correlates with interest in the long run, and I don't see any reason why interest is about to shoot up now. Give it some time, a quiet build up of adoption in the areas where Bitcoin can really solve problems now will be much healthier than another sudden bubble.

Or maybe not 'buh'. Simply allowing subscription payments in Bitcoin does nothing, the whole subscription model is flawed and bitcoin doesn't solve that problem.

That's true, but the profit made by two year holders has come mostly at the expense of people who bought in during the bubble and after. Bitcoin cannot indefinitely have it's main value in speculation. I do expect that there will be another large speculative bubble some time in the future, but I think at this point we want more people getting into Bitcoin to use it for online commerce and remittance rather than as a speculative investment. The price is high enough and the price is stable enough to find those use cases, encouraging too many people in because they may profit from a future bubble is probably what we *don't* want.

I don't think that's the way to do it. Voluntary tipping could be enough if it becomes mainstream. Only a small portion of readers/viewers converting into tips could easily beat ad revenue. Paywalls also do little to stem clickbait. It means the user pays regardless of whether the article was good or not, so the same incentives apply. Tipping means that happy customers reward writers and incentives change.

I think education about security is actually only a small part of what needs to happen. Certainly users need to adopt a particular mind set, that bitcoin is cash and thus you need to be serious about it. Just as you don't keep $10k in your back pocket on your typical work day, you don't hold $10k in an online computer.
The bigger thing though is that adopting good security habits needs to be straightforward and easy to achieve. Nobody should have to put a lot of thought into their security policies, they should be simple and standard habits easily adopted. I think the tech and UI for bitcoin still has some way to go in that regard, but with hardware wallets etc. it's certainly getting there.
The educational barrier to entry is still high. I have introduced a number of people to Bitcoin recently, but have generally simplified and skipped some aspects because they are too much for a simple introduction. Yet if anyone plans to seriously use bitcoin, they need to go through that education or they get burned. With ChangeTip I can introduce people to Bitcoin without public and private keys from the start, we need security options that are just as straightforward as that.

The solution is already in-built. Miners just have to set a reasonable minimum mining fee that they'll pick up. They don't even need to do this by consensus if I understand it correctly. Thus any application which plans on using the blockchain for purposes other than intended, simply has to pay the minimum fee. Or perhaps a dynamic minimum fee depending on the size of the message?

Apparently a user on another forum admitted to stealing most of them. Maybe you can convince him to give you your coins back, but the private key alone won't be enough, as that is now public knowledge.

Not alone, no. The transport company could have a proprietary system though based on Bitcoin. You simply get a smartcard with a public key on it. You top it up by making payments to the given public key. The proprietary system deals with deducting your balance at the gate, and allowing you to check your balance online.
We have a similar system in Dublin called the "Leap Card". It has a couple of pain points though. Can't top up online, must go to a store. Can't check your balance except when you're using it. I believe the data is primarily on the card itself. A system based on bitcoin would alleviate these pain points, but not dramatically over the same thing paid with fiat.

Bitcoin won't fully take off until the user-end of it is simultaneously easy to use, simple to understand, and secure. The back end decentralized protocol doesn't need to be understood for bitcoin to be used, but I think the front end stuff has some way to go.
Thankfully, Changetip is very simple to grok, easy to use. It still has the problem that you're letting a third party hold all the keys to your wallet, and when they're in charge of so many bitcoins, you know there's a big incentive to hack them. We'll need services that are just as user friendly as changetip, but allow you to be secure in your money.

I'm probably in the minority here but I don't see consumer adoption as the way that bitcoin will become mainstream. I don't see MS passing the savings on to the bitcoin user, and this isn't really addressing a 'pain-point' for consumers. It sort of is, in the sense that the younger audience which spends money on XBox Live etc. often don't have bank accounts, and at best can access their parent's credit card (it might be a shock to some but not all parents let their kids use their credit cards at will). Yet still, those same kids are unlikely to have easy access to bitcoin either, unless they just happen to live near a bitcoin ATM.
The pain points that bitcoin solves remain the same IMO that they were yesterday:
1. Remittances, but depends on local bitcoin networks
2. Online tipping
3. Certain instances of online purchases where the savings are very large (Steam).

I think for many perhaps the assumption is that consumers will use bitcoin because they *want* to use bitcoin. To some degree that's true, the consumer avoids the personal financial risk of giving their credit card details out, and the other benefits, but I think the greater incentive is to share in the reduced costs enabled by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-13 01:49:14
Despite all bitcoin transactions being public, this is really hard to measure. You can look at how many wallet accounts are created on BlockChain.info and coinbase etc., but that won't be definitive, people can make multiple accounts and there are lots of other wallets for which we don't know how often they're used. We can see that the transaction rate is rising every month, but even that is fairly opaque, we don't know that those transactions are meaningful economic activity.
What you can more easily measure is interest in bitcoin, by looking at Google and Twitter analytics for example. Those are pretty low at the moment.
What I'd love to see is the activity in the various remittances applications using Bitcoin. Sadly, that's just as hard to identify if you're not in one of those companies yourself.

I do agree that there's no reason for most people to have bitcoin right now outside of speculation, or privacy/security concerns etc. There are some particular use cases where you can clearly save a bunch of money by using bitcoin, *if* you have access to an exchange with low fees. The most obvious cases: remittance services where there are good exchange options on both sides, buying steam games, and buying stuff online in general by taking advantage of the gift-card system. They are fairly narrow use cases though, and most people would not be aware of them, or sometimes not financially concerned enough to bother.

The merchant selling pressure probably won't come till tomorrow. It seems that a lot of people are shorting, but are being thoroughly squeezed.

I really don't think so, because withdrawal and deposits would be more awkward and always cost fees. Admittedly you have to be in Bitcoin already, but putting money into ChangeTip and taking it out is trivial in a way that could not be done with fiat.
1. Any fiat system is going to have significant fees both ways, you won't have as much money in your tipping wallet as you put into it, and when you withdraw, you won't get the full amount from your tips either. ChangeTip and miner fees by comparison are trivial.
2. It took Paypal years and years to be able to support banks and credit cards from all over the world. To this day you can still have issues with Paypal and similar due to your particular national circumstances. ChangeTip was able to work immediately as long as you have bitcoins.
3. Any company processing credit card transactions is going to have a large burden to deal with anti money laundering and fraud. I've worked in companies that have to deal with this, and it can be a very big burden, especially when your business is essentially moving money around. Bitcoin enables little companies like ChangeTip to bypass this problem because they only deal with bitcoin deposits. The money laundering burden is left for the services that exchange in and out of fiat.

I would love to have tipped more, but I am trying to stick to a monthly budget in this regard.
I think any of these three could blow ChangeTip way higher:
1. A major Twitter celebrity tipping or retweeting a received tip.
2. Larger Youtube channels recognizing how ChangeTip could supplement their income and talking about it (TheYoungTurks would be a good example)
3. Facebook tipping coming in time for long distance Christmas presents

Because it's limited by the amount of money we can give. We could give the same amount of money over more days, but that would divide our efforts and make it less difficult to trend.
Also, some users of this sub don't like it getting filled with tips, so having it on specific days potentially reduces the annoyance.

Probably a good idea. If you tip them on Twitter, they might retweet it. If you tip them on Youtube, it is likely to get lost among the comments (who reads Youtube comments...?).
But on the other hand it's important to show people that it's possible to use in Youtube comments, because I honestly think that's where the biggest use-case for microtransactions is. In the graph someone showed earlier, far more people have been searching Google for the ability to tip on Youtube than on Twitter.
@_date: 2014-11-18 21:29:59
There is certainly going to be some disconnect in terms of how we see the problem, coming from the developed world. Zimbabwe may be a particularly extreme case. I see Bitcoin filling a need in places where there is a significant amount of money, but that money is at risk (from government actions, possible inflation, or banks freezing accounts as in Cyprus). So maybe Russia as an example, though they don't seem interested in Bitcoin right now. I would also think of places where there is a lot of economic activity despite the general poverty, such as India.
Regarding your point on cultural mindset, I think that is more an American thing than an overall Western thing. Tips certainly are much less expected in Ireland and many other European countries than they are in the US. The disposable income aspect to it however is certainly similar.


This certainly is true, the mantra on this subreddit is that you shouldn't buy more bitcoin than you can afford to lose. Clearly if you are higher up the economic ladder, you have more freedom to gamble on something new. Yet, isn't it interesting that mobile phones took off so quickly in Africa? Surely a mobile phone was a big risk for most early adopters, they may be cheap but the cost is not insignificant. It seems that the need filled by mobile phones is just great enough that that lack of disposable income was overcome.
Also, doesn't the M-Pesa example you linked show that really, this need clearly is there, and Africa is already leading the way in terms of practically used digital currency, precisely because of this need. It's an ad-hoc approach, and imperfect because of the centralized nature, but the solution exists because the need exists.


I doubt that Western Union or MoneyGram will ever be able to lower their transaction fees to something closer to 20,000 Satoshis (~8 cents). However, with Bitcoin low fees are now a possibility. Come to think of it, if you're not worried about quick confirmations, then Bitcoin potentially brings down the transactional cost of cross-border remittances to near zero. Friends and relatives sent $32 billion US to Africans last year, but they lost $2 billion to transaction fees. This is ridiculous! A few months ago, William Suk gave us an in-depth review of a remittance service that was built on Bitcoin and is working today in Kenya. In my opinion, remittances are the low-hanging fruit, and it's only a matter of time before we see similar solutions being deployed in other developing countries.
You're totally right here, I used to work in a company providing a form of remittance through mobile airtime, and they were competitive because airtime remittances had much cheaper rates, yet even they took a big chunk, especially through FOREX rates. I see bitcoin remittances as the bootstrap personally for all other services. In fact, this might end up working pretty well ad-hoc with ChangeTip right now, as long as there is a single exchange that people at home can use, though there's still the problem you mentioned of trying to get the market rate.
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:00:53
No, this is not a naive assumption. If you started accepting bitcoin, you would initially get very few customers. *If* it takes off, then one day it could save you a lot of money on fees used by other non-cash payment methods. It may never take off. Obviously those of us here believe it will.
As for legal issues, I'm not a lawyer, that's really something you'd need to talk to a lawyer about. If you're mostly paid with online transactions, there's a possibility Bitcoin is worth it for you right now, but it doesn't sound like it. It could be worth it later.
Thanks for taking the time to look into Bitcoin though :-)

Doesn't it kind of make sense that there would be extra costs to getting gold depending on region? It's a physical commodity that needs to be moved with high security, the cost of which would differ by region, especially if there is a lot of corruption in that region.

Although it highlights an important benefit of Bitcoin, I don't see this having an impact the way the situation in Cyprus did.

It's a chicken and egg scenario. Merchants could easily accept bitcoin but why bother when there aren't so many customers using it? Users have the same problem, why get into Bitcoin and accept all of it's current foibles (awkward interface, different approach to security, volatility) when barely any merchants accept it anyway?
The path to mainstream use will not be through normal buying and selling in developed countries. It will only get to that point when the network effect is so large that it becomes the preferred currency in general. Instead Bitcoin will grow by addressing the pain points of fiat and credit cards, and bootstrapping a larger network effect from that.

It is happening, it just isn't going to happen worldwide overnight. Look at the recent example BitSpark. They're offering 1% remittance between Hong Kong and Indonesia. There's a number of very successful examples in Africa too, for example the service that integrates with M-Pesa in Kenya.

Buy what all right back, the local currency? No. From there you exchange goods and services in bitcoin instead of local currency. At least that's the idea. Realistically, most people will see dollars and euros and a superior alternative to bitcoin, since they are generally seen as stable, and you don't have to explain to people you're interacting with why they should accept dollars or how to do so. This to me is the flaw in the "hyperbitcoinization" argument, at least if we expect it to happen in the near term. People are far more likely to flee to dollars and euros, at least right now.
Capital controls complicate matters, but cash itself is fairly resistant to capital controls. Dollar inflation also complicates matters, but right now the general population is likely to perceive the problems of bitcoin (present volatility, low liquidity, low understanding) to be larger than the problems of US dollars and Euros (capital controls, inflation risk).

With long term storage, you should be confident that nobody else has had access to your private key.

I don't know how a hard fork will look for certain. The last one was in 2010 when the network was much much smaller.
I think your problem here is assuming that a solution needs to be adopted by a large majority. Practically the entire community recognizes that there needs to be a solution put into place for this, and soon. Once a solution starts being adopted by miners, the others looking for one will follow, because it's in their best interest to find some solution. So, not a majority necessary, just momentum behind one particular solution (I expect that will be Gavin's solution, since it's simple, straight-forward and already implemented).
@_date: 2014-11-13 14:57:07
Ok, guess it depends on what you meant by small tip. You really shouldn't be giving less than a dollar to someone who isn't aware of Bitcoin IMO. Those tiny tips will happen when the tipping culture is more widely accepted, in larger numbers, in hopefully a much less spammy way.

Bitpay and Mycelium use an algorithm for being confident about a transaction before the first block is mined. I believe it involves running a node locally and applying some math so that you can see the confidence that there won't be a double spend situation. Apparently it rises to the high nineties quite quickly.
Not many services are using this algorithm right now but I imagine it would become standard or something similar will.

I think it really depends on how normal microtransactions become. Right now because there are so few people tipping online, it has to be a large amount to be meaningful. But, imagine a Youtube video that gets 1 million views, in a world where tiny tips are normal. If the average viewer only tipped 1c, (and that could be one out of 10 tipping 10c, or whatever distribution), then the video creator earns $10,000 for that video before you even think about ads. That sort of culture could be the end of clickbait, it would no longer be about getting the page view, it would be about satisfying the viewer to the point that they give a $0.01 tip (on average).

In the case of cash, that's probably true, because it's very difficult to verify who really owns it. In the case of private keys, you could easily just pick it up so that nobody else steals it, and send a message on the BlockChain to the public key informing them how to get in contact with you.

I don't think steady growth is possible, at least not at early stages. Slow, non-volatile growth would show that bitcoin is *clearly* viable for the purpose of storing value and exchanging it for goods and services, without having to deal with volatility. That in itself would bring in more buyers, and suddenly the growth is fast, and volatile again.

I believe you are right and that in practice, this event is already priced in.
To play devil's advocate though, the current main demand for bitcoin appears to be speculative holding. This is visible from the number of coins that have not moved in months (there was a chart of this on the sub recently, the vast majority of coins have not been touched in many months). So, the main source of supply on the exchanges is mining, and the main source of demand is holders (new or old) buying to hold. Day trading is a major activity of course, but it is not the main source of demand (and it can't be, by definition). So, when the halving happens, you will have half the new coins coming in compared to a presumably unchanged amount of buyers. Half the supply, same demand =&gt; price increase. In theory. There are obvious reasons why it's not quite as simple as that.
Edit: Another theory is that some of the mining pools are currently dumping their coins on exchanges at a high rate in order to keep the price down and keep competitors out of the market, ie. engaging in a loss-leading strategy. If that is the case, and it's purely speculation, it would be expected that they'd wind that down ahead of the halving in order to reap the benefits of mining with fewer competitors.

They're already holding bitcoin. Why would they buy back bitcoin? They have bitcoin and now they can use it. It is the exact same case as if they bought dollars. They buy dollars and can save or use it. They can exchange it for goods and services when they need to, as long as the other person is willing to accept it. The more people accept it, the more other people are willing to.
You're not really describing anything unique to bitcoin, it is the same as adopting any foreign currency as a replacement for national currency. There are problems unique to bitcoin at present, but not what you're describing.

Foreign currencies failing, especially small countries like Venezuela, help rather than hurt the dollar. Since the dollar is the most widely used currency, it's the default option when a national currency fails. So a small national currency failing creates additional demand for dollars, and reduces the impact of inflation/money printing.
The only danger is from larger countries with very large foreign currency reserves (such as Japan and China) who could do more damage to the demand for dollars by selling them, than would be made up by demand from their populace.

The price matters if you're invested in bitcoin and want to go to the moon some time soon. It isn't necessarily a predictor of success of the currency*. Two different motivators for excitement among this community.

The OP in this thread is making the argument that you don't need any more consensus than 51%. There already is consensus among non-technical users.
Nothing happens to the 49% who disagree. Their bitcoins are the exact same on both branches up to the moment the fork is scheduled to happen. I don't believe this is going to be that dramatic, it's not like every bitcoin miner has to adopt the fork at the exact same time, only ahead of the time the limit is set to be increased at. As the instances of the new version increase, it will eventually reach critical mass, miners running the old version will see the writing on the wall and switch over as well. After the date, when there are two functionally different bitcoin protocols, the scenario described in the OP will occur. That's my take on it, at least.
All that said, it certainly is a big test for bitcoin's ability to adapt when necessary. Will be an interesting thing to watch.

On the one hand, this is hilariously bad, but on the other, it's pretty dark in that it shows that they're quite serious about trying to get rid of cash and be involved in every transaction that exists, no matter how trivial.

Generally yeah, since every transaction is on the blockchain. I don't know the specifics of this situation but I imagine it's complicated by the nature of it being a very large and complex bitcoin exchange. Do we even know the public addresses that were holding the coins in MTGox? I imagine that every time someone made a deposit into MTGox, a new bitcoin address was created specifically for that, which is on chain, but only individuals likely know what address they sent to. Any transaction on the site itself would be off-chain. It's all theoretically traceable, but at the same time a large complex mess, it may not be that easy to determine what coins went to buyers who legitimately withdrew their funds versus thieves (hackers or a company insider).
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:07:53
Yup, agreed. It may work once or twice on a trust basis, after that it will be just plain exploited every time.
Although at the same time, if it's enforced with a multi-sig bitcoin wallet, a lot of people may just not bother. If you don't hold bitcoin, who's going to go out and buy $1 worth just for this?
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:15:38
Nobody holds bitcoin, you hold keys to bitcoin addresses. If someone obtains your private key somehow, they can use your bitcoin and send it to one of their own addresses.
MTGox was a bitcoin exchange, which usually entails holding keys on behalf of other people. Since they held the keys, it was possible for them (or hackers) to steal the coins by sending them to another address and claiming ignorance.

At the same time, you need to buy BTC to use it. Unless you're a holder. If you are a holder, now seems like a really bad time to get out, regardless of deals. On the other hand now might be a good time to buy some to use on Black Friday deals, if they're worthwhile (strategically, probably best to buy at the last minute, not long before you use them).
It will be very interesting to see what happens. From the sentiment on this forum and traders might sell out early for fear of merchants dumping a lot of coins. But will it happen before, during or after BF? Will there be buying pressure on the day due to deals? If people do buy for BF deals, will they get hurt by volatility when they actually try to spend them? If they do, next year's BBF could be dead in the water, but the reverse could also happen if they use their coins while the price is still rising.
And at the same time all of this could amount to nothing and BBF could be a huge flop.

Once you've downloaded the Mycelium wallet and set it up, you'll have the option to "receive" money. There will be a public key which you can share online or in your android clipboard. You want to copy that key and withdraw with it on this page on ChangeTip:

From what I've read on this subreddit (can't find the link, hopefully someone else can recall it) but someone added up the reserves all the bitcoin exchanges claim to have, and it was more than the total available supply of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-01-12 23:14:09
75% consensus is quite a difficult target to reach. Clearly Bitcoin manages the standard of being hard to change without requiring the higher arbitrary standard of 95%. It's just a matter of degree which we're arguing over, but neither are easy targets. In the long run it's likely that even 50% consensus on a change will be borderline impossible to reach.


Please then, explain to me how a system which cannot change can be anti-fragile. Anti-fragile systems are improved by the experience of stress. Improvements can only happen if changes can happen. A system which cannot change can be at best resilient to damage, but it can't be anti-fragile.

It's good that you have the humility to recognize that, but it's not consistent to use your own concept of consensus which is clearly not accepted across the community to justify the moderation policy of conflating these implementations with 'alt-coins'.

Despite that, the Bitcoin didn't show up even after the transaction had several confirmations.

I am talking about the possibility of it happening within the next few years, yes. There's no guarantee that the proof of concepts will become practical real world tools in that time frame, indeed the user interface aspects of Bitcoin itself is still seriously lacking and we're six years in.

@_date: 2015-08-25 15:49:18
Is that true? In the case when a soft fork is in the process of happening for example, there are different implementations of the consensus rules. One is stricter than the other. But they are both involved in the network consensus mechanism.
And I believe there are other ways in which the code could diverge but a network consensus still occurs at runtime.

I'm sorry to say your question doesn't really make sense. You seem to think Bitcoin is something like a traditional database, it isn't. I think if you want to understand why you can't "cancel" stolen bitcoins, you need to start from the beginning and get a more concrete concept of Bitcoin in your mind. It's not something that's easy to grok, so don't worry if it takes some time, it does for everyone.

To answer the question in your title. I've followed lots of cloud mining listings on BTCjam. Sooner or later they all go bust. It's impossible to say for certain that any cloud mining provider is a scam, but given the record and given the suitability, you should probably just take it for granted that they are very likely to be Ponzi schemes.

You should start using a new word or phrase instead of "consensus", it would make it clearer what you mean when you're arguing for it. What you're asking for would be a closer fit to "90-95% consensus". Otherwise what you are engaging in could be described as Motte and Bailey tactics where you use a commonly understood concept to defend a narrower position.
When you acknowledge that, you're arguing about a quantitative difference not a qualitative difference between and alt-coin and the forks that have happened before. It becomes an issue of how do we balance the need for a stable and secure transition vs. giving disproportionate power to dissenters.
Nobody wants to move forward without consensus. It's just a matter of degree which is getting argued over.

@_date: 2015-08-25 16:03:50
Do you believe it's not possible for the network to come to consensus on the longest valid chain with different implementations running on the network?
The actual issue I was addressing in my comment was that with one project, whatever problems that project has get inherited by the network if those are the only clients they can choose to use. If there are multiple projects, users and miners have a choice. Bitcoin was designed so that the users can come to a consensus even if the developers in one project can't.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:28:51
4 is the only one that is basically impossible. If the fork is successful, hash power will collapse relative to difficulty on the Core chain, and it would take weeks to resolve itself. Miners on that fork would abandon it as they're wasting money, and a vicious cycle occurs. One fork or the other (or both, in a catastrophic scenario) will die a quick death, that is guaranteed.

In my view, Bitcoin price is almost totally led by speculation, and only slightly impacted by actual adoption. As a result the psychological impact of the debate can end up being the largest factor in changing prices. That doesn't mean I think there shouldn't be a debate, I think it's fairly crucial that it's had, but it would impact both informed traders and interested newbie speculators on the verge of getting in, who read about the block size spat and it gives them enough jitters not to buy in.

Block rewards are all or nothing. It's 25 BTC per block reward if you're not pooling, but depending on your hash power, you could spend months or years before you actually create a new block. Pooling is a way for miners to gather together and split their rewards, to make it more of a consistent income.

Let them argue their case. I'm not afraid of people attempting to change the fundamental aspects of the protocol, because I take it as a fundamental assumption, just as Bitcoin itself does, that the majority of the network will work to maintain the value of the coin and not to destroy it. If such a scenario were to happen, it certainly wouldn't be moderator censorship or repository commit rights that protect against it. If those are what you believe are protecting the network from such changes, you should sell out of Bitcoin immediately because they are both easily routed around.
Edit: Remember that they would have to do more than control 51% of the hash power. They'd have to convince merchants to change their nodes etc. because if they are violating the rules of existing nodes, they will be ignored by those nodes.

The ledger for now until the fork happens is exactly the same. Even after the fork happens, most transactions will be valid on both and they will mostly mirror each other. Divergence will happen over time, but more realistically the losing fork will cease to exist very shortly after it happens when it becomes clear that they are wasting energy.

Yes, it's probably an opportunity to make money.

It's not like other forms of decision making, it's much harder to get such a high level of agreement in distributed software than in other political agreements because there is a lot of inertia, it takes a lot of time to debate, create updates and deploy them. You have to choose a realistic level of consensus that will allow Bitcoin to adapt with time, because it is inherently difficult to change. That difficulty to change is good and important, but it can't be unrealistic to change when necessary, otherwise it will not be anti-fragile over time. Instead it will stagnate while more flexible technologies arise to disrupt, co-opt or replace it. If you value anti-fragility in Bitcoin, then making it impossible to change or difficult in the extreme, will destroy it's ability in that regard.

The important point is that they only rule over their repository. No miner has to run their code, nor that of Core.  I feel like the water has been muddied by the idea that how consensus is achieved in Bitcoin Core is "Bitcoin consensus". In the end the most important consensus happens at runtime.

Unless you specifically use the Bitcoin P2P lending sites, you're still using a bank account to get money in and out of the platform. Even then, unless you get all your Bitcoin via LBC or similar, which is expensive, you're probably using a bank to send money to an exchange. That said, it certainly is a reduction in bank dependency. I am close to being 100% independent from the bank at this point.

The cost of fees is not determined by the price of BTC. It's determined by the available capacity for transactions, and the demand for those transactions. If BTC was worth $100,000 but the transaction volume and capacity were unchanged, you would simply attach lower denomination fees to your transactions (measured in Satoshis instead of bits).
So, the future of fees is uncertain, but it's not the price of BTC that leads to that uncertainty.
@_date: 2015-08-23 13:50:29
Clearly it hasn't or it wouldn't be such a huge point of contention.
For me 66% would be an overwhelming consensus in most contexts. A 75% supermajority of votes would be a clear sign of consensus among miners, although that is obviously not all that matters. The ecosystem itself is more important, ie. merchants, exchanges, etc. signalling their intentions. Again it doesn't have to be near unanimous but I don't expect miners to get anywhere near 75% of hashpower on XT without the ecosystem being ahead of it.

What is your definition of consensus? Mine is "a general agreement", which is the same as what I see in dictionaries. Does yours require unanimity? A supermajority behind a proposition is widely considered to be consensus.
Do you really expect miners to go forward with XT without the economic consensus behind it? A coin is only worth what people will pay for it, if people aren't going to pay for Bitcoin after an XT fork, and if the ecosystem hasn't started upgrading their nodes to XT and otherwise signalling their intentions, then they would be commiting economic suicide. As would the "lying miners", who are again deliberately undermining the stability of their own investment. It just isn't realistic that miners will adopt this without consensus... unless your definition of consensus requires permission from people with commit access to a specific code repository. By that definition there's a good chance it will go forward without consensus.

The difficulty with this is that you are ensuring that we are forced to go through this whole process again some time down the line, and quite probably very soon. The length of time between 1MB and 2MB is likely going to be much much less than 0MB and 1MB. If a contentious hard fork is difficult for the network, then a whole series of contentious hard forks is not something we should move towards. It's like the 'raising the debt ceiling' nonsense in the US.
However... I am somewhat inclined towards that solution in spite of all that. I think that the taboo we've developed over the concept of a hard fork in the Bitcoin blockchain is more harmful than the hard forks themselves. A series of hard forks may help to normalize them, and remove the stigma around them, as I think that at least a supermajority hard fork should be seen as a legitimate and normal way of forming consensus. It will also dispel the myth that bitcoin can only be changed if you convince almost everyone, because in practical terms that's simply not true.

Bitcoin is all about keys. Wallets store your keys and allow you to make transactions, but if you're using a web wallet, that means you're leaving your keys with someone else, ie. the people who run the website. Just like your house or car keys, it's much better to keep them yourself and have a back up, than to leave them in the hands of someone else. If you lose your keys, you lose your bitcoin, and if someone else has access to your keys, they have access to your bitcoin.
I don't use a desktop wallet but most people seem to say that Electrum is a good choice.

You won't need to do anything, you won't lose your bitcoin. Both will have the same historic transactions and new transactions will be valid when broadcast to either side. The divergence will actually be from the newly minted coins, but likely in practice the losing fork will be abandoned fairly quickly.

Ok, suppose we reach consensus on this issue (devs and outside community). Does that mean we will always reach consensus? I don't think so. The big test for Bitcoin is not 'can we reach consensus' but *what happens when we fail to*.
Many of the core devs feel that if we fail to reach consensus, we should make no change by default. Contentious forks are intrinsically bad due to technical risks.
The other view is that failing to change in the face of real need due to a lack of consensus means that Bitcoin will rapidly stagnate and fail to meet the needs of increasing scale, and that the ability to change is fundamentally important for the system to remain competitive.
So far I've used the word "consensus" to mean that of agreement between core developers and the community. But that kind of consensus is inherently fragile, humans by their nature will always divide along the lines of ideology and personal interests. Relying on that is a guaranteed failure in the long run. The test is for *runtime consensus*, can the runtime consensus survive and prosper and evolve even when we as a community are divided, as we inevitably will be?

I'd love to be able to set an email alert whenever a listing with certain criteria gets posted. ie. If I could set it so that whenever an A or B listing, with a short term or whatever other criteria, so that I don't have to watch for them manually.
I'd also like to be able to organize my calendar a bit more, given that I have hundreds of investments and most of them are quite small. It would be great if I could rank my calendar repayments by size, and perhaps have filters to remove the tiny payments from it. The current ordering appears to be arbitrary, and I have to dig into it to get a sense of my performance.
I'd *really* like to be able to say "Google" or "Facebook" in comments without it turning into (Website Removed).

I'm ok with leaving developer consensus behind. Developers only exist to make code available for miners and users, it's not useful to have them as some kind of political committee where any one of them can block a contentious issue from going forward despite it having the support of actual miners and users. Their input and their technical skills are valuable but that doesn't give them the right to block users and miners from progressing without their leave. Calling a fork a hostile action makes it as though miners should not be allowed to have the code that executes according to their view available to them without the political agreement/permission of developers.

They can't dictate what code miners will run. They're merely signalling their intentions and that they'll support the proposal if and when the fork happens.

It's not though. Loads of people understand consensus to be a broad concept, all the way from majority to unanimity.

A whole bunch of things. Firstly it will improve automatically as the ratings algorithm is based on machine learning, with more training data (ie. time) it will naturally tend towards higher accuracy.
But other things include more testing of features before they deploy (I see way too many bugs for a financial application), better processes for identifying borrowers (I have suggested allowing an opportunity for borrowers to live stream with investors so that the latter can be confident in identity without relying on BTCjam's processes). Taking fees on repayment instead of at the outset, etc.

But if all you want to do is buy shit online and you don't care about the privacy risks of using a credit card, then you should probably wait and see if Bitcoin becomes more useful to you some day in the future.

You have to propose a mechanism before we can say how it could be gamed. One of the current proposals introduces the possibility of a "25%" attack, where an attacker with 25% of the network hash power could continuously reduce the maximum block size until it tends towards 0.

No, absolutely not. A 100% unanimous requirement would be a disaster, it would mean that I as a banker or other party with a special or personal interest could get involved in Bitcoin and prevent any further developments by simply running a node/miner with today's version, and never updating. I could do the same by getting commit access and calling any threatening Bitcoin Improvement Proposal contentious.

While the basis of the economy today is fiat currency, nothing. Bitcoin has to become the basis of the economy, where everyone uses it and it's potentially more stable than any currency that has existed before. What's going to stop bubbles? If you believe that inflationary monetary policy is the cause of bubbles, well, that's not going to exist any more, or at least fiat currencies will be relegated to a sideshow (as cryptocurrencies are today). If you want to know about how monetary policy leads to bubbles, I suggest you read up on the Austrian school of economics. Mises especially.

For you right now, maybe. Put your coins in a paper wallet, photocopy it a couple of times so that you're less likely to lose it, store them away somewhere safe and private. Then forget about Bitcoin for a few years. Maybe someday the paper wallet will be worth something, or maybe it has all crashed and burned. Worst case, you won't have lost much, best case, you could win a very slow but potentially lucrative lottery.
@_date: 2015-08-23 12:57:10
The losing coin continuing is also not realistic. With a huge hashpower drop compared to difficulty, the losing fork wouldn't be able to handle load, it would be finding blocks infrequently and even assuming they were die-hard it could take weeks to recover difficulty. In reality the writing will have already been on the wall, long before the actual fork, and they will have switched over because mining is expensive and burning money isn't fun.
@_date: 2015-07-15 07:02:56
It's a matter of tracing where the coins came from. In practice unless you take specific measures to ensure your privacy, most coins of the same users end up going through common addresses. The pattern is the movement of coins, not the addresses.

XT is not going to fork without consensus. Anything below 70% of mining hashpower voting for it has an extremely low chance of happening, it will take many years of blocks before it would become likely. Miners are not going to all go gung ho into XT without signalling from the merchants, the exchanges, the ecosystem that this change is actually wanted and they are ready for it, nobody wants to mine a worthless coin. So, unless you have some other definition of consensus, this is not a realistic characterization of the BIP 101 fork.
@_date: 2015-08-14 12:35:12
It is though. The minimum fee is voluntary on the part of miners. It is a choice to not accept transactions with lower fees based on other limiting resource. If there was no other limiting resources, spam would not be a problem and could be accepted by all miners no matter the fee. If you send a transaction below the minimum fee, it will still get picked up eventually by a miner who does not use the default. As such there is capacity for transactions of different fees, including zero, which is the real limitation on how much you have to spend to get your transaction processed. The price *is* determined by demand, demand for fast transactions. If you are willing to wait, you can set a zero or low fee transaction and it will still get through, usually.

I honestly believe that normal purchases will be one of the last areas where we see Bitcoin take off. It will happen, but the benefits are fairly obtuse to the vast majority of people. Credit cards work mostly "good enough" already for most people in the developed world, despite their flaws.
It's the 'hard problems' that will (and are already) take off with Bitcoin, especially where credit cards fail. Remittances in Africa is a hard problem. Peer to peer lending (done internationally) is a hard problem. Buying drugs online is a hard problem, etc.
@_date: 2015-07-25 12:03:34
Most people have a low credit score. The important thing is can you afford to pay the very high interest rates as a result? Also, pay attention to what your loan is denominated in, if you don't have a BTC income you absolutely should be setting CoindeskUSD or CoindeskEUR.
Put effort into your pitch, your best chance of being ignored is if you don't give enough detail on what you're doing with the money and how you intend to pay it back.
Chances are you'll get funded unless you have chosen a crazy high target. There seems to be a flood of investors lately, who are perhaps overly willing to invest in loans with very little info. Some of the loans that get funded are shocking.

In the long run sadly, I don't see how we can possibly have every little transaction in the world directly on the chain. It seems fairly absurd that every coffee or tiny micro transaction between machines should get recorded permanently to all nodes, when that could likely mean trillions per day.
The question to me isn't whether it will end up a settlement layer or not, it has to. The question is what path we take to get there. ie. Does it happen organically (with perhaps some last minute catastrophes along the way) or does it get shepherded by developments to the code, which worry some users about developers taking central control of the protocol/ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-07-18 12:05:56

I micro-manage, because I find it fun. It's like a game, but with delayed rewards. If I were to use auto-invest I'd definitely limit it to A and B, D's listings are almost always terrible IMO, and I skip most C's as well. (by skip, I actually invest 10 bits, ie. a fraction of a cent, just to remove the listing from my queue and also to see if the borrower turns out ok)
Also, I try to be online at the time the new listings are coming up (seems to be US Pacific coast business hours), because the really good listings get snapped up quickly.
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:16:10
What is objection to Replace By Fee again? This seems like an extremely useful feature right now. Anyone finding their transaction getting stuck as it is now could simply resend their transaction with a fee higher than the spam fees, and get confirmed quickly. That is if I understand how it works correctly.
Edit: I see the answer is potential collusion with miners for a double spend, preventing 0-confirmation transactions. It seems to me though that in this environment, 0-conf transactions are already at serious risk. People are using bitcoin for serious purposes now (for example repayment of loans, if they're late they get fees), they need to be able to have some kind of 'retry' mechanism.

The platform is very much immature, and rife with scams. I'm still getting good returns despite that. If scams concern you a lot, I would suggest either not using auto-invest, changing your investment strategy, or waiting on the P2P lending sites to mature.

It comes down to the commonly held view here that monetary policy is the root cause of asset and stock market bubbles. Incidentally, yes, in the Austrian view if the economy ran on sound money, the stock market as a whole would not 'always go up', indexes would be much more stable and there would be more focus on dividends.

The value of gold has very little impact on the value of fiat. Fiat has value because people generally believe it has value, they're willing to accept it for goods and services as are the people around them, that is enough to sustain it as long as there isn't a sudden increase in supply.

If they were doing serious volume with Bitcoin, it would be a good idea to use one device for accepting payments and another for actually using the bitcoin. I believe Mycelium Gear supports HD watch-only wallets. Accept payments with Gear, but don't bring the phone with private keys with you so clients can't rob you.
Edit: Following replies to this comment, it seems it would be better to just use two phones, both with Mycelium. One has a HD wallet, the other has a watch-only version of the same wallet. I'm not sure how to do the latter, but it's listed as a feature.

Thanks for the reply. I would respond with two points though.
It's certainly a risk for every crowdfunded product today, and crowdfunds today are rife with scams. Although I think that there are ways that cryptocurrency could reduce the trust element (Koinify was making steps in that direction, although sadly it seems the business is too niche for now). I would hope for cryptocurrency crowdfunds to try and move in that direction, but it doesn't have to start with yours, I can accept a trust element when this concept is still in the experimental stages. I am considering buying some simply because experimenting with the idea of cryptocurrency for holding a stake in a project is worthwhile.
I have heard the "it will kill the product and our reputation" argument in so many video game kickstarters before. It hasn't stopped crowdfunded games from shitting on their customers and abandoning the project. Again, that doesn't necessarily reflect on any developers other than the ones who did this, but I do think it makes that argument weak through the demonstration that it's happened very often in the past.

It's a damn good thing this will never happen. If you think block size is controversial, it would be *nothing* compared to changing the reward schedule.

I have to come back to this post, because it shows something really important. I think up until now there were three main ways Bitcoin could fail:
1. Bitcoin could fail to find a real world use case while still in the speculative phase, and crash before it gets the chance
2. Technical/scalability failure (such as the situation being argued over recently, blocksize limit.
3. Killed by bank/government action.
With these remittance services, there's no rolling back. They are going to keep growing because they really do solve difficult real world problems for people. Even if Bitcoin fails, Dogecoin or whatever will pick up the pieces, because it is just too damn useful, the idea is out there and it's now proven. Same thing with P2P lending, Bitcoin makes it work on an international scale that was never possible before, it's not just going to disappear.
I've always thought that 3. was a remote but plausible possibility. It very well could still happen, but Bitcoin is well placed to win in a disruptive war against banks and eventually governments.
So that means technical failure is the only remaining possibility that's reasonably likely. And that kind of failure is only likely to be a setback for Cryptocurrency, although it could kill Bitcoin as the leader.
To me this change from purely speculative to a proven system with real world applications already working today, makes it much more reasonable to be fully committed, where a large proportion of your investments is in the cryptocurrency area.

Paxful, LBC and the like are always going to be much lower volume than exchanges like BitStamp, BitFinex etc. because the cost of transacting on those exchanges is orders of magnitude lower.

The free market absolutely will be blamed, at least in the near term. Capitalism has again become the bogeyman, to blame for all the excesses of those who are actually benefiting via special interest capture of the state, ie. crony capitalism.
However when cryptocurrency really takes off, whether it's Bitcoin or something similar, the state will find itself greatly disempowered. A heck of a lot of state power comes from control of the money supply, when it goes, the effects of that will ripple out into other areas of the state. I hope and expect that a crypto-currency based free market will force the state to recognise that it must accept a greater degree of voluntarism, or it will slowly become redundant.

Bitcoin isn't immune from that. See: Mt. Gox and what's going on at OKCoin right now. Rather, it is easier to put pressure on exchanges to be truly transparent, both because moving bitcoins is so cheap (the biggest problem with gold is the cost of security in making a transaction of any kind), and obviously because it's a public ledger, meaning you can easily see if they prove their reserves and move your coin elsewhere if they don't.
Even with this, it's clear that number of exchanges today must be acting as fractional reserves. It's up to the users to keep the pressure up and force exchanges to prove their solvency.
@_date: 2015-08-07 15:29:53
Ok. I don't really know how quickly you can turn that into Bitcoin, especially if you're not in the US now. A transfer to an exchange such as Coinbase would be normal. Could you use Circle and buy with credit card?

What about Bitcoin stock markets? Nobody says that Bitcoin stock markets should be more stable *today*. The entire Bitcoin ecosystem is a tiny puddle by the ocean that is the world economy. It's 6 years old, extremely immature and existing in the context of a world economy based on fiat currencies.
Edit: Bubbles will still happen in a world economy based on sound money. It's the market as a whole that will be more stable, as bubbles will be smaller scale and faster to burst.

I do feel mainstream payments are a long way off for Bitcoin, at least in the sense that it's not an area that will grow rapidly, early. There are certainly big advantages over credit cards for both users and merchants, but for the most part they don't outweigh the network effect on both sides, and the difficulty in getting into Bitcoin in the first place for users. Mainstream payments just isn't a big problem most people in the developed world are trying to solve in their lives, and people in the developing world don't have as much money to be buying stuff online.
Bitcoin will get there eventually, but it will do so by growing off the network effects it builds from areas where it really does solve big difficulties people are having in their lives.

A fully transparent lottery would be fantastic. In most countries lotteries have become effectively a voluntary but regressive tax on the poor. They're usually a state monopoly, or an oligopoly based on licenses provided by the state (and additional regulatory overhead costs). A fully transparent lottery would be able to return far more to the customers in terms of prizes, while still making a profit, if it could somehow get around the legal issues.

"A lot more discussion" is an issue for the blocksize debate. It's not what I was talking about, my comment was not a summary of the entire video.
As I showed above, Adam did argue exactly what I said above re: the decision making process in core.

Is this a problem in normal usage? This is a unique situation where someone deliberately intended to give away lots of tiny coins in such a way that they would be impractical for the receiver (almost white elephant-ish).
In my country, despite the fact that the euro is legal tender, you can't expect a business to accept more than a certain number of coins in a transaction. If I were breaking up my euros into entirely 0.01 coins, it would not be accepted by merchants. You can get rid of them but it takes more work(cost), and over time some solutions have arisen such as coin counting machines which take a cut. This is just a more extreme version of this since Bitcoin allows tiny denominations. It's not something that has to be a priority unless it somehow became a circumstance common enough to cause significant difficulties.

That's true, but it does give us more possibility to exert pressure on institutions that engage in fractional reserve banking, for example by only doing business with institutions that do proof of reserves.

You're asking on the forum, where almost all of us believe in Bitcoin. I think you know what we would say ;-)
In seriousness, Bitcoin is a high risk investment. It could all go down the toilet, who knows. It's only been around for a few years, after all. Despite that, I feel pretty strongly that it has a strong future. The most important thing when investing in Bitcoin is *don't spend any more than you can afford to lose*.

Yes. Fees are set by the user sending a transaction, and accepted or not by the network. It's in effect an auction system to get included on the blockchain, so if the price of Bitcoin is higher, you can include a fee that's a lower denomination.

It is unfortunately pretty hard to buy bitcoin with credit cards (due to chargebacks). Similarly with PayPal, as PayPal will freeze the money and treat the seller as in the wrong by default. It is still possible with both, but will greatly depend on where your clients are based.

Adam argues in this video that the best defence against special interest group capture for Bitcoin is to have any new proposals require unanimous approval from a group of decision makers. Where does he get this from? This sort of decision making process means that it is much easier for a malicious actor to halt any further development. It eliminates the possibility of Bitcoin being anti-fragile, for which the ability to change is crucial. It means that they only need one of the group to become obstructionist, come up with all sorts of theoretical problems to any important new change and use them to justify blocking it, ensuring that development comes to a standstill. The best defence against malicious special interest capture is not a unanimity requirement, which actually makes it more vulnerable, it's to decentralize development by having multiple competing implementations. You can then sigh a relief about being responsible for trillions of other people's dollars. Miners are responsible for the code that they run, and it is more healthy if they have multiple compatible options to choose from. Acting like developers are responsible for the entire ecosystem is unhealthy in itself.

I don't think the ability to buy bitcoin is the biggest barrier any more, it's fairly easy to buy bitcoin in most of the US and Europe now.

I can't answer for the other poster, but it wouldn't be .0001 BTC any more. Assuming that there is as much demand/transaction space as now, and the price of Bitcoin has risen, the fee price denominated in BTC will drop to compensate. Right now lots of clients don't give you much choice in the fees you can send, but I expect that will change with time (it is already improving).

Bitcoin was deliberately designed as digital cash, where UTXO's are the coin equivalent. You get the good with the bad, but the divisibility of cash into smaller coins not practical in large amounts has not diminished the fungibility of euros or dollars.


Only if it is a serious problem. It doesn't appear to be a major practical issue.


Are you suggesting that Coinbase would deliberately dump thousands of UTXO on a user? Why on Earth would they do that? Remember that it would have to be done deliberately, because a high number of inputs to a transaction doesn't mean there must be a high number of outputs. Further, Bitcoin puts the fee burden of the transaction on the sender, so it's the sender that takes the cost of splitting outputs into tiny pieces.


Why? There's no sign that this undermines the utility of Bitcoin to the user. It is possible to do bad things in Bitcoin, but that doesn't really mean that this is a problem in normal use.
Edit: Notice how unusual the circumstances were when it arised for you. They gave you private keys to sweep, in other words they were tricking you into taking the sender's burden. That is far from the normal way of making a bitcoin payment (you provide an invoice, public address and amount, and they take the burden of sending a transaction, for which turning it into tiny outputs costs them as much or more money than it would cost you).

The "internet of things" is basically the internet, but with highly connected devices. Importantly, devices need to be able to a) identify themselves and b) transact financially. Imagine devices paying and using each other for services dynamically, as needed. Some possible applications of this: devices negotiating for electricity and internet connectivity contracts on the fly. This would allow, for example, to set a policy for your mobile to buy data from wifi connections it passes, potentially making data much cheaper especially where you have monopolies/oligopolies. A Minecraft server could outsource chunk generation to online services when it's under heavy load. Your self-driving car could go refill itself at a local charging station, at a negotiated electricity price, etc. There are a lot of both very straightforward applications today as well as some pretty futuristic ones as well.

Be brave. IMO, this is an advantage of bitcoin, at least if it became ubiquitous. If you ever got stuck in a city with no money or cards, you'd need to beg from random strangers for bus money.

The only reason to feel any shame about it is if you *don't* pay them back later.

Some wallets do an analysis of recent transactions to determine what the fee should be if you want a fast confirmation. I expect that kind of thing to become more popular. I also hope that the Bitcoin Network itself will become better at handling the situation when a user sends a transaction only to find it's not being confirmed. The current way it works by default is pretty poor, you can get stuck for hours and a user who doesn't know what to do may lose money by attempting to send the transaction again.

False accounts have certainly been a problem. They introduced a fraud team a few months ago, but it will take time for any effect to be seen. I think it's definitely an area they could improve on, by giving lenders more tools to verify the users identity themselves.

You mean exchange volume rather than on the actual Bitcoin network then?


I don't think that was intentional fake transactions. The transactions were real and intended to clog the system. The question is whether the normal pattern of transactions day to day is representative of economic activity or not. I would argue that the transaction volume chart is far more representative than the BTC or USD volume charts which are almost entirely noise.
@_date: 2015-10-23 16:43:00

There's a youtube video on their homepage.
Seems to be that it's a way of buying bitcoin in shops just like you buy airtime, but I guess making it conceptually easier by hiding most of the bitcoin details, apart from when you scan the QR code to pay for something online.
Edit: It appears they hold a balance in Rands, and only use bitcoin for the actual online purchases. So they're taking on all the volatility risk too, but it means it's ultimately a centralized system similar to M-Pesa
@_date: 2015-11-04 07:50:52
You would still need some measure of purchasing power, and fluctuations in such. Volatility remains in that regard whether fiat is involved or not.
@_date: 2015-11-01 19:22:59
Another way of looking at it is that this spike is to $178 million by that metric, when a typical high day is $100 million and a low day $30 million. All those numbers are way above realistic economic activity on the Bitcoin network, and this Ponzi scheme certainly didn't just bring in $78 million in a day. It follows that whatever creates the spikes massively inflates the USD volume that's actually going on, and exchange activity is the most logical explanation for inflated volume due to their huge transaction inputs/outputs.
In other words, *something* is causing more money to be put into and/or taken out of exchanges. The rising price is a reasonable explanation of this, but the Ponzi nor other explanations can't be ruled out.

Sorry, I think this is potentially a difficult situation. I assume that the transaction had quite a low fee relative to size in bytes, since I can't find it in a block explorer (says it has already been dropped), can you say if that's true?
Do you think you could get the sender to resend with a larger fee? The sender may need to ensure he uses the same coins though, to avoid this transaction somehow confirming again in the future.

GetGems is a Bitcoin wallet. The GEMZ token runs on the Bitcoin blockchain. GEMZ is arguably an altcoin although it's only meant to be a special asset related to the app, not a general currency or competitor to Bitcoin, but the app is inarguably a Bitcoin app.

Sorry, I edited in the link now. It should take about a day to be cleared from the mempool. Yes, it will return to the wallet it was sent from.

@_date: 2015-10-21 16:47:54


This isn't exactly true. They could together censor the bitcoin blockchain, but to rewrite it beyond perhaps a handful of blocks would require vastly more hashpower, as you would be racing against the honest miners from a tail-start, given that the longest chain is recognized as the valid one by the nodes that matter (merchants, exchanges, wallets etc.)
@_date: 2015-10-27 21:39:01
It means that there is another transaction attempting to spend the same inputs. In the end, only one will confirm.
Often this happens due to a current exploit/attack where the same transaction is duplicated, but it is ultimately harmless unless you have functionality which depends on the original being confirmed. If you link the transaction then someone here can tell you if that's the case or not.

Those spikes usually align with large price changes. In my view it's more likely related to people moving coins to and from exchanges. Transactions by exchanges can have really large inputs, much larger than the actual economic activity involved.

Are you sure that the decreasing prices will compensate for the fees? If not, what do you do?


Are you sure that the interest rate will be raised sufficiently to deal with inflation? If not, what do you do?
Alternative investments are not money. They can't be used to pay for a sudden cost, like your savings can, without dealing with both volatility and the costs involved in investing. Less liquid assets are intended to be held for a long time, they are not a rainy day fund like savings.

MMM. It is openly a Ponzi scheme (although it also talks about being a sharing economy), which appears to be going viral in China. There are good reasons to be sceptical though, there's been no objective measurement of the level of demand it creates, and Bitcoin is merely one among many ways to fund it.
Needless to say, stay away from Ponzi schemes. You may think you can get in before it's unsustainable, but that is also what the people who end up holding the bag think.

The long term trend for volatility is downwards. It's pretty good that Bitcoin now is beating some major fiat currencies some of the time, even if only when they are at their most volatile.
@_date: 2015-11-01 13:22:02
The latter two are "faked" without any intention of faking. It's just the nature of Bitcoin transactions, that huge amounts of bitcoin can be tied up in a transaction which is only actually sending 0.001 BTC or whatever. They are also more trivial and cheaper to fake if it was being done intentionally than actual transaction volume.
I am not arguing with the conclusion that Bitcoin adoption is on the up. I believe that, especially based on LocalBitcoins volume charts, given that those transaction are all high cost and it would be much more expensive to fake.
@_date: 2015-10-14 12:58:28
I think it's fair to say that signal on this graph is totally drowned out by noise. The graph shows $25 million being transacted on the blockchain in the slowest days, and that's on-chain transactions only. Does anyone believe there's that much economic activity in the Bitcoin network yet? The rate of change in noise isn't something that is meaningfully informative, but it shows as the bulk of the volume.

What do you mean by disrupt? If you mean it in the Clayton Christensen sense, that's a rather bold claim, and I suspect your concept of disruption is a bit over-broad.

Volatility of purchasing power is an issue, for now. I don't think he realizes where the stability of fiat currencies comes from, it's not because they're "backed" by anything, it's by the enormous clout of their network effect (and only as long as the central bank exercises sound policy over long periods of time). Bitcoin has a much weaker network effect than almost all fiat currencies for now, but it has the potential to achieve the greatest network effect (everyone in the world with internet access).
I find it interesting that the people who get the most emotional about Bitcoin in a negative way, seem to be proponents of gold and commodity currencies. The two camps have so much in common, but it seems like this heresy makes Bitcoiners even worse in their eyes than people who support fiat.

He acknowledges that in the post. The question then is how much is it priced in now and how much is the event itself and the run up to the event going to affect prices. If you believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis, then it's already been totally priced in as it's a well known event, but the EMH is more a useful heuristic  for traders than an actual law we see play out in practice. We could look at past halvings, but part of the problem is that our collective expectations have already been set by past halvings in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

I think a lot of services like this could get going if you have a dual/general purpose Bitcoin ATM/vending machine. There is no point having a service like this without accepting fiat coins as well, any service that relies on Bitcoin being ubiquitous will be too late.
I could envision yours and similar services working well if the machine:
1. accepts coins and small notes for payment.
2. accepts Bitcoin for payment
3. sells small coins for Bitcoin at a fair rate, perhaps even favouring the buyer
4. issues job contracts via Bitcoin. Service providers must ID themselves so that there's recourse if they try to abuse the system.
The Bitcoin element would initially just reduce the overhead of servicing the machine for physical coins, services and supplies. Eventually it could be entirely self-sustaining, and overflow profits above a certain level to it's owner's bitcoin addresses.

Like you said at the beginning, the war has already started. It just didn't start in Europe this time (WWI and II also didn't start in Germany/France). We already have a multi-front war (Syria, Iraq, Yemen, arguably others) with numerous nation states in the Middle East with various factions joining sides, and a recipe for escalation. IMO the history books will have called WWIII starting some time ago. Indeed, a leader of a nation state (Jordan) has already called it WWIII.

The transaction has to propagate over the network to reach miners who will include it in blocks. In my view the fact that many block explorers can see the transaction mean that it likely hasn't failed to propagate. So it should be included soon enough.

It's the reverse. A large volume Bitcoin transaction (say 100BTC) has as much cost as a small one, assuming the same number of inputs. Pass 100BTC 1000 times and you've got 100,000 BTC volume, whereas if you do 1000 small value transactions, it's just 1000 transactions, but both cost the same in fees. The volume metric is more easily faked due to the multiplier effect involved.
Similarly, the volume created by Bitcoin exchanges, which tend to use huge inputs in their transactions even if they are mostly going to a change address, swamp the value of regular economic activity in such a metric.
TLDR; The BTC or USD volume charts are pure noise and no signal. Transaction count is more likely mostly signal.

This is where I have a problem. In the link he goes to, he eventually argues that enough distributed, trusted, known, "miners" who are not using proof-of-work, but are given permission to create periodic blocks and all have legal contracts with each other, they will be incentivised to be pro-social and not attempt to centrally control the blockchain because doing so will likely land you in jail.
I'm skeptical of this claim, and it's certainly unproven. But it's probably worth trying at least, before it can be dismissed.

Other subreddits allow posts to be tagged for filters. There are links then to limit what you see. Worldnews does this for major events, GameOfThrones uses them for spoiler management.
I personally like the occasional price thread, but I understand that they're annoying. Filters similar to those other subs is something that mods could do if they feel it's worthwhile.

If you do it, set realistic expectations. A little convenience store accepting Bitcoin shouldn't expect to get more than one or two customers in a year, because Bitcoin isn't really solving a major problem there. Focus on businesses with lots of international customers, where there is *some chance* of a practical benefit vs. fiat cash.

You can't do a bunch of wash trades during a run up or a drop, at least not without high risk. It would require the exchange themselves putting fake numbers out, which admittedly is possible of course.

They buy more at an exchange. The purpose is to increase their stock, which they will sell and rebuy on the exchange many times before the loan is repaid, each time making profit they couldn't have otherwise.

The reason it's hard to get $5 worth of Bitcoin is because the time and effort involved in exchanging fiat for Bitcoin, given that not many people have it yet, isn't usually worth it for such a small amount without a major mark-up.
Aside from the gift just gave you, if you wanted a tiny amount of Bitcoin like that you'd probably just need to know someone personally (friend or family) who has Bitcoin, and is willing to trade.
