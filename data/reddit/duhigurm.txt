Nobody is taking the largest slice.

Make sure the first thing you say is that there's money in it for them if they listen.
That way, if I can't bring myself to hand my phone over to two complete strangers, my inner money demon will possess me briefly and give me some courage.

In my opinion, it's downright impossible to learn how to use bitcoin without actually having any bitcoins. You could read or hear all you want about it, but you'll never "learn" how.
So when you give out a tip of 0.04$ to someone who has no bitcoins, you're giving them more than just four pennies; you're giving them the opportunity to learn how to use bitcoin.

Sure. Anything for money, right?
This did bring to my attention that having images to go along with the coins was probably a bad idea. Time to contact the devs!

If we can somehow figure out a way to evenly distrubute each type of node, ('cause obviously minting is "over-powered") then this would be a good new protocol.
Unfortunately, I can't believe that such a change could be organized. We'd have to nearly instantly change every client, node, and miner to support this new change, otherwise we'd have thousands of users sitting around waiting for the rest of the users to switch.
This is actually a good thing.

I have no idea what I'm doing! But maybe this will show me?

But that's part of the bitcoin experience.
