There's still some getting to be done by GPUs. Then it's on to the gaming! As long you build for gaming you haven't made a bad investment.

Kill-a-watt is under $20 and is very very handy. Just buy one and quit bitchin'. You can even hack it.

Definitely need more data. Which pool are you using? Which version of GUIminer? If you're using Slush you have to have the latest version of GUIminer with Stratum support.

I tried to find you one but Google quickly suggests ASICs. Spacebarcowboy.com has plenty of ascii porn though.

Campbx rocks. I can have a coin go from my wallets to Campbx to Dwolla within 24 hours. Often times less. One upvote from me.

Actually I've already had two replies. First one said they can't do it. I replied the site was slammed, please do it. They replied again saying click the link and do it yourself. As usual their service is pretty bad but at least I got quick replies.

Nov/Dec 2014 shipping? That's quite a bit to shell out when we don't know where BTC will be in 15 months. At least my Jalapeno has about paid for itself. If I get my Single in December 2013. I should still be making a coin a month. Remember, always include the year in your orders!
@_date: 2013-06-23 06:52:36
You don't want to know because you'll shoot yourself in the foot. It was smart to wait. May the hardware last you at least 9 months!
In other news - You got your 9/6 order already?! Wow. I'm nearly drooling for my 9/17 Jalapeno.

Have you ever looked at Campbx as an exchange option? I've been very happy with them to date but haven't moved anything from Dwolla to Campbx. Just the other way around.

And twenty units by Friday!! I bet they at least double capacity next week. What do you say? 0.5BTC to SeansOutpost if I'm wrong?
@_date: 2013-06-23 06:47:48
I can't seem to sell my soul to another forum. Even for $2. Now if it were 0.2 I'm sure there'd be some newcomers.

+bitcointip  0.09 BTC - first one bounced. Added funds.
@_date: 2013-07-07 21:33:52
What he said. Best reply. Even if you were gone for months and came back to it being 6+ times higher that would be fantastic. Especially if you were just sitting on BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-28 23:02:04
+1 funny or -1 duh? Nobody with a 2013 order will be seeing it that soon. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 00:42:11
I finally managed to get my 0.1 off to SeansOutpost as well. And my offer/bet still stands - if BFL ships at least twice as many units next week I will send another 0.5 BTC to SeansOutpost regardless of downvotes!
@_date: 2013-05-23 16:14:24
Awesome. Damn, I need more BTC to fund my account. I'd tip you if I could! Somebody tip that guy ^^^

Definitely don't invest in PC hardware specifically for mining. ASIC's are literally *potentially* shipping any time between now and March depending on what you read. If you're a gamer then buy the best AMD/ATI card you can and mine on it while you can. Local rates for me average about $0.11 kwh and I do much better than breaking even and like another poster mentioned, it warms the room. I intentionally have several machines throughout the house to help keep it warm. If/when ASIC's do ship then I'm dumping six video cards and keeping three.

Under $100 per Ghash is very realistic. It's just trying to get something ahead of others without paying a premium that is difficult.
@_date: 2013-02-24 17:27:32
Or install TightVNC which doesn't give a shit either. Fake monitors for all!
@_date: 2013-05-26 06:33:37
I think I'm gonna throw up after seeing that page. The animated flash slide show is nauseating. And the photos of charts, coins, and bills in that animation? WTF? I thought Yahoo shutdown Geocities. Show people final product as requested. Not many left who just want a show.

BBB is a load of crap any way. They want the business to pay hundreds for the "privilege" of using the BBB logo and being a "member".

Down clock the CPU a LOT though it won't be a large difference in overall power consumed. Just unneeded. Definitely mine while you can. People are dropping like flies and I'm just making more without adding more hash power. You could have days, weeks, or even months of profitability though everyone with an ASIC order is hoping only days. 
Oh, and there's for these questions :-)

8298 on a Jalapeno in September, 18498 for the Single SC in February. Really hoping the Jalapeno can do at least a coin a month as the hash rate spikes. I'm prepared and saddened it won't maintain that!
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:11:12
I think it's more like we'll move you to the back of the line so you can wait for expected power consumption / Ghash ratio. I asked to confirm my orders via Email because of the website being under extreme load.
@_date: 2013-01-20 21:27:45
The cost of implementation is just too high on my end. My peak rates are $0.11 Kwh. I didn't start early enough in the game to even consider the possibility. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:29:22
Downvotes for offering to help feed the homeless? Wow, heartless bastards!
@_date: 2013-05-14 19:18:11
Will this be available to watch on the web at a later time?! I would love to hear the guy especially since I've sent him a small amount of BTC.
