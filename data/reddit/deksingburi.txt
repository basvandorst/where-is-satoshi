Facebook coin (Libra) is going to be a gateway of Bitcoin to the whole world. And, we won't wait to transfer to the bank account anymore. Coinbase is one of the Libra partners.
Libra has inflation because it backed by fiat currency. When the number of Libra transactions growing up, Libra Foundation value increase but Libra price still the same. Bitcoin price increase by the number of Bitcoin users, stores, exchanges, transactions, and node validators.
Libra will make non-crypto people start to familiarize with the crypto payment, wallet, and exchange. Especially, how to purchase the product, that underlines the price with the dollar, but pay with other currency such as Libra, Bitcoin, or Ethereum.
The U.S. and other government always make a differentiation between Bitcoin and stable coin by identifying,  tracking, authorizing, and restricting stable coin.
Many Facebook hater governments will ban Libra but accepted Bitcoin. So, Libra can't be the world currency.

Separating level of the password also help it. People login every day but people average withdraw only 5 times per year. If the exchanges verify withdrawal account before adding it, people verify it only 1 time per 10 years. Hacker can't steal high level of password because the phishing website can't stay the first list of google for long. We can also add email confirmation in withdraw security but we can't add it in every time customer login.

Nick Szabo is Satoshi Nakamoto. 
Nick Szabo is a polymath. The breadth and depth of his interests and knowledge are truly astounding. He’s a computer scientist, legal scholar, and cryptographer best known for his pioneering research in digital contracts and cryptocurrency.
He talks about the necessity of second layer blockchain on top of Bitcoin and small block size.
"The block size shouldn't even be a public debate. It's like a public debating and voting on the graphite reactor settings that prevent a nuclear reactor from overheating and shutting down. There are certain things you should let the engineers decide, and this is one of them. For some reason, there's this whole group of people that want to pull out the graphite moderator rods and let this run at full steam."

BCH is not doomed to fail. BCH is successful. 
Let's me explain why BCash will overtake Bitcoin in the future.
Miners can't get a lot of fee from Bitcoin because of No fee from LN. But BCash has been created by miners for miners. Miners took it in our own hands. We're BCash miners and supporters. We invest a lot of money in mining hardware. How can we get our money back if we didn't block LN or created BCash. 
We don't have good developers but we can copy and modify the code from Bitcoin.
We don't care the users because we have and bitcoin.com for propaganda.
We don't need small block limit because we have no transaction. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:20:07
Do you use the whole blockchain wallet?
Do you store the whole blockchain on your computer?

We can receive the benefit from bitcoin right now. Such as I use bitcoin for moving money abroad because it is the cheapest way. I still use bitcoin at stores that discount. Someone use bitcoin at dark markets. Someone use bitcoin to be paid by people who can not pay me cheaper by other ways.
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:57:48
You have to learn more about market mechanism. Every company in the world use this concept. Only way they can control Bitcoin is they have to use ton of money buy Bitcoin at higher price until they have more than 51%. If current owners don't want to lose stakeholders new owners have to use more and more money. The amount of money that they have to use supposed to equal or higher the amount of money that current owners can make another Bitcoin (exactly same power and worth). If you sell them at lower price, that means you're stupid. The price that they buy and current owners sell so call fair price. After that, if current owners think major stakeholders make this currency direction in worse way, current owners can sell at the high price. Then they invest in another currency that they think it better or create currency that more powerful than old currency.  
Ethereum will do it soon, Let's see what happens. 
Who's learning?

@_date: 2017-10-05 11:28:02
Big blocksize's good for miners in long-term but it's bad for bitcoin in long-term. Your boss knows that, Jihan Wu supporter.
The block size limit doesn't matter in altcoin because nobody uses it. In contrast, Bitcoin block size limit is very important. 1,682 GB blockchain size increase per year is a disaster for Bitcoin.
8MB every 10 minutes: 8MB * 6 * 24 * 365 = 420,480MB per year. (420 GB)
16MB every 10 minutes: 16MB * 6 * 24 * 365 = 840,960MB per year. (841 GB)
32MB every 10 minutes: 32MB * 6 * 24 * 365 = 1,681,920MB per year. (1,682 GB)
There are block size limits in Bitcoin Cash.

Prune Blockchain has been finished the debate. It's a failed solution because someone have to store whole blockchain. And they have to upload it to everybody without any profits. The less whole blockchain validators, the less reliability of Bitcoin. If we lose all whole blockchain validator, Bitcoin will die. 
Prune blockchain node validator can secure new transaction by validates them. But they can't make Bitcoin more reliability from losing whole blockchain.

The Segwit2x agreement was immediately violated by ViaBTC who released their own fork of the bitcoin blockchain with the release of Bitcoin Cash(BCH). This was immediately listed by several exchanges in China and Japan. Soon after the release of Bitcoin Cash, several miners including Antpool, BW Pool, BTC.top etc. that were the major participants of the agreement began mining Bitcoin Cash which some can call as a violation of the agreement. Bitcoin Cash created several problems for the bitcoin blockchain as the hashrate from bitcoin mining moved to Bitcoin Cash leading to slow block generation and higher fees on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-05 10:54:54
I don't believe that. Voting by hashrate is nonsense so nobody cares it right now. That's a good thing for Bitcoin evolution.
In the future, we have to vote by how much bitcoin we hold. This's the best solution to make the direction of Bitcoin. Nobody wants to ruin their asset.

Network bandwidth is a big problem. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:54:30
That's obvious. The Lightning network with 1MB block makes miners get the lower fee in the future. Many miners don't like it.
The Large miners have blocked it for last 3 years. Bitmain isn't only the largest mining pool and the largest customer grade ASIC seller. Bitmain Technologies Ltd also invests a lot of money in research and develops secret Bitcoin miner microchip in the future.
The miners took the BCash (BCH) into their own hands right now.

You're absolutely wrong. Energy cost is affected by transaction fee and subsidy. In the future subsidy's going to be near zero but fee will be increased by Bitcoin price. Small block can decrease the fee and solve the energy problem. Lightning Network can maintain Bitcoin fast and scale. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:37:10
The energy cost when Bitcoin price is $100,000 will be disaster. Energy cost is affected by transaction fee and subsidy. In the future subsidy's going to be near zero but fee will be increased by Bitcoin price. Small block can decrease the fee and solve the energy problem. Lightning Network can maintain Bitcoin fast and scale.

Yeah, I agree with you. We shouldn't use bitcoin if the discount less than the credit card discount (3%-5% include exchange rate). We shouldn't  support this business model. 
BUT, But, But Using bitcoin helps adoption which increases the price of bitcoin. We need the benefits of bitcoin just to persuade merchants to accept it by using it. We can receive the benefit from bitcoin right now. Such as I use bitcoin for moving money abroad because it is the cheapest way. I still use bitcoin at stores that discount.
Someone use bitcoin at dark markets. Someone use bitcoin to be paid by people who can not pay me cheaper by other ways.

I didn't say Segwit2X will be worth $3600. I said Segwit2X will be 10 times more worth than BCash. I surely BCash will go down or die after they move to support Segwit2X. They know Segwit2X is the highest chance to destroy the Core developers so they will all in. Core supporters hate BCash and BCash supporters hate Bitcoin Core but Segwit2X is the middle of Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash. A lot of people support Segwit2X because Segwit2X is an NYA proposal and the most decentralized coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:39:15
That's why we need Lightning Network and small block size limit. Bitcoin can't survive without them.

Everybody wants profits so nobody can work for you for free. I'm ok with developers or someone who makes bitcoin be better makes profits from Bitcoin. 
You boss, Jihan Wi obviously make profits from bitcoin and make bitcoin's worse.
BCash always uses pure PoW (No layer 2, no evolution) because BCash is the coin that your boss Jihan Wumakes for you miners.
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:38:20

Voting by hash rate no longer exists after miners tried to block Lightning Network for their high fee and split Bitcoin to Bitcoin and BCash (Miner Coin).

@_date: 2017-10-07 07:56:28
It's free money because the dilution value less than new coin value. Segwit2X isn't a competitor only Bitcoin but It's competitor of every currency coins. Only Bitcoin holders get this free coin but BCash, Litecoin, ZCash, and etc. don't get. Crazy Core Supporters won't move money to support Segwit2X so Bitcoin will dilute a little bit. I surely BCash will go down or die after they move to support Segwit2X. They know Segwit2X is the highest chance to destroy the Core developers so they will all in. Core supporters hate BCash and BCash supporters hate Bitcoin Core but Segwit2X is the middle of Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash. A lot of people support Segwit2X because Segwit2X is an NYA proposal and the most decentralized coin. 
Segwit2X won't hurt Bitcoin but it will hurt only Core developers. Segwit2X will hurt BCash more than Bitcoin. It's absolutely free money for Bitcoin holders. How to decentralize is how to balance the power of the both sides.

I'm sorry for your loss. 
2FA is a stupid solution to protect customer accounts from withdrawals by hackers 
Withdrawal password should not be as same as trading password. The exchanges have to create 2 or 3 levels of password separately. 
1) View
2) Trading
3) Withdrawal 
We have to verify withdrawal account before adding it. That is the highest security level (level 4). We can also add email confirmation in level 3 and 4 for more security.
I've sent a lot of emails to every exchange customer services but they never care. 
Forex exchanges never get this problem because every Forex exchanges do this password and verify withdrawal accounts before adding it. The first time I came to the cryptocurrency market, I shocked when I see the security of Pholoniex. I don't know why people are OK with that.

@_date: 2017-10-18 21:52:49
Whatever unit you use Bitcoin (BTC) or fiat (USD). We also compare this energy cost between Bitcoin transaction and credit card transaction. Credit card transaction cost always decreases every year but Bitcoin without Lightning Network transaction always increases. That is the weakest of Bitcoin.

In my experience as a stock analysis, it never is an average of 2 value (2013 and 2017).
If in 2013 is the shortest and in 2017 is longer than in 2013, this time will be longer than in 2017.
days in 2013 = 625 days
days in 2017 = 1,125 days, so days in 2017 = 180% of the days in 2013
Then days in this time will be 180% of days in 2017 = 1,125 \* 1.80 =  2,025 days
2,025 - 525= 1,500 days left to hit 20k again
