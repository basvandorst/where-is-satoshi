This full course is also available on Coursera! Totally recommend it, this is what got me started into the tech side of the cryptocurrencies, it's from 2014 but has aged very well.

I got into bitcoin back in 2013, but at that time I was only 17 living in Venezuela and earning less than 10$ a month and couldn't invest any :( it's even saddest when you discovered it early but can't get in.

It happened to me at 7$, then at 27$, then at 270$, then at 420$. 4 mistakes were made, never again.

Don't put more than 15%. It's still a risky investment.

Civilized discussion among crypto supporters.. Yeah right...

Let's just add that the coin is called Bolívar Fuerte (strong) because some years ago it was so devaluated that three zeroes were removed from the bills, so actually, 1 Satoshi should be worth 1000 bolívares.

In Venezuela anything that generates you money is illegal. Having your own business, working with foreign currencies and so on, what's written on the law doesn't matter to be honest. Several people have been arrested for bitcoin mining under different reasons: money laundering, terrorism and so on.
That's how things in my country works: it's not illegal but if you get discovered doing it you'll be in problems.

I am really surprised that the złoty is even visible on that chart. That must be me.

I used to live in Venezuela, on 2014 I got into bitcoin and convinced a bunch of friends to get in as well. I left the country on 2016 and since then they still thank me for that. All they do for living is mining bitcoins or ethereum, earning about 40$ a month which is uhhmm about 8 times minimum wage.

I have, it's just that I don't fully understand it. I have read that I need to have my seed, blockchain.info gave me a 12 word mnemonic seed, do I need to use a BIP91 generator with those words and that would be my private key?
