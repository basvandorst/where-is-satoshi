The amount of bitcoins will increase over time for many years to come... until it doesn't anymore, at which point it will become deflationary.

O_O I never even thought about that.. holy shit I'm rich or something! Nevermind the USD value, I have a millionth of all the Bitcoins ever!

You're a dick, dude. He just wanted to tell a story with a lesson, it's not harming anyone or anything. Leave him alone.

Or, you know... we could just use XMPP (Jabber). That's decentralized, too. You can run your own server using one of many open-source daemons with your own security standards and talk to anyone else on any other server, with client-side encryption (OTR, PGP, etc.) and TLS from client to server and server to server. Also there are many client software packages to choose from... so why should I give my fiat (yes, my fiat. Kickstarter won't even accept Bitcoin) to Bitmessage, and especially to a third party saying he'll audit it?

dash is a proper replacement for the moment. I do miss my bash as system shell though...

Beta testing is one of my favorite ways to spend my time. Thanks for the idea.

A bitcoin can get you a whole lot of Reddit gold...

 Tell me when you can get this guy's Bitcoins and I'll worry about where my private key is :)
Upvoted anyway

They refunded it, with the reason that it was below the minimum value.
I may try again with 3 Euros worth. I dunno. Their site is VERY unstable looking, using a $10 DV SSL certificate, and no sanity checks. It looks like a scam.

Dark Wallet and OpenBazaar look like incredible projects.

Checked everything I own. The only vulnerable thing (my router) requires authentication before ever running a CGI script. Sure, my ISP could exploit it over DHCP... but do I care? No, because this is what authentication, verification and encryption are for.

"Is Shellshock a threat to me?" generally has the same answer as "Am I stupid?"
Before anyone mentions embedded devices, those fall under the category of "stupid" unless they allow you to change their firmware.

Why specifically 21? Seems like a weird number to set as a goal.
I'm planning on buying quite a few more when I have fiat to spare.

Encrypt your private keys with a **strong** passphrase.
Some people say to store them entirely offline in a paper wallet or device like Trezor or similar, but I'm assuming (maybe wrongly) that you're not extremely tech savvy, or simply don't have the time.
If you choose not to store your keys offline, then don't **EVER** let the system holding your BTC get compromised.

They actually did refund my Bitcoin, but I believe it's simply because they were watching the thread. I wouldn't have missed 50 cents, but they would've missed their credibility.
@_date: 2014-09-25 19:55:44
Oh fuck it, I'm well-off, I can afford to lose $2 of Bitcoin proving this is a scam. Hold on a minute while I send you some chump change and then present proof that you never sent anything back.

Any explanation of what these projects are, what they do and where I can make said donations?

Ensure that if you're running the node behind a NAT (home router, for example) that you have port 8333 forwarded.
If the number of connections still doesn't go up, try this from command line:
bitcoin-qt -maxconnections=100
    
    $ btc getnetworkinfo
    {
        "version" : 90201,
        "protocolversion" : 70002,
        "timeoffset" : 5,
        "connections" : 70,
        "proxy" : "",
        "relayfee" : 0.00001000,
        "localaddresses" : [
            {
                "address" : "CENSORED",
                "port" : 8333,
                "score" : 17221
            },
            {
                "address" : "IPV6 CENSORED",
                "port" : 8333,
                "score" : 6903
            }
        ]
    }

That really only helps the price, not the network itself, or adoption of it.

I heard that if you commit suicide, your bitcoins will increase exponentially (^2 every day for a week).

Not right now. Maybe next Summer. Cheapair isn't going anywhere, right?

In that case, CryptoSea should refund me my .001 and tell me that themselves. I suspect that they won't, though :) Enjoy your 50 cents and your further-ruined reputation!

Short term (24-48 hours): Bitcoin is dead
Long term (after that): Everything's fine. Everyone who matters updated. Post-quantum crypto was implemented.

How did I deal with the flash crash? I slept through it.

I'm tired of seeing it posted every week, so I wanted to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.
If they do pay out fine for a week, then what's stopping me from 0 confirm double-spending against their clearly poorly built site and profiting off their scam? I might just do that
@_date: 2014-08-19 21:33:51
What you really wanna do is buy a server in someone else's datacenter, not buy a computer and put it in your house. The entire server costs $20/yr at some providers, but you get a very barebones system and no assistance setting up your node.
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:36:41
Not sure if I'm reading this correctly. Are you asking "Should I get ripped off really hard, or should I get ripped off even harder?"
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:36:02
Doing this doesn't solve the problem. Setting a Bourne-compatible shell like dash as your system shell seriously limits your exposure though.
    rm /bin/sh; ln -s /bin/dash /bin/sh; # don't do this without ensuring you actually have dash installed. It's there by default on Debian-based systems.

I'd rather not spend it at places that accept it via Coinbase/Bitpay/Xsolla, though I did end up having to use Newegg to buy a new laptop after mine broke. Was a very nice experience actually.

Very much this. Host it with strong TLS 1.2 security and GCM ciphers only.

Guess that means there's more blood to be spilled... I hate to say it, but that's NOT a good thing.
