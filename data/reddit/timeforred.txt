Your post just reflects your lack of understanding. 
Keep your cryptocurrency in a downloaded wallet like Copay, one where it's not controlled by a company/third party, and have a backup recovery phrase. Your funds will not "disappear" unless you keep it in a web wallet like Blockchain.info
With cryptocurrency, you 100% control YOUR money.
