Well, it's illegal according to Swiss law for the average Joe. :-)
You either have to be a Swiss citizen or meet a bunch of requirements, like keeping a certain amount of money in there (a number that is beyond most people's reach, I believe, though I haven't checked in many years), if you live there that makes a big difference, etc.

No one would propose this as the mechanism, though. It would come in the form of people demanding to get paid in btc.
OP is right, though, it's probably not going to happen without some big players getting together and saying they'll back the transactions while they're in flight.

It's based on the idea that the crime you're convicted of warrants a maximum punishment, but by considering your character the judge can go easier.
That's how the law views it, so you're not suffering anything extra for other crimes you may or may not have committed, but if you can convince the judge you're awesome...

Oh, no, I actually meant in the **bitcoin** space. What is not already happening with bitcoin that would require a company like Google to come in?
I really can't think of anything. If this were the pre-bitcoin days and they came up with the idea, it's very likely they would have launched it to create a new ecosystem where they're a central player but the incremental innovation is left to others, not different from Android.






This is exactly the thing. Whenever someone says some big company should get involved in bitcoin, I always ask, "...and do what?" and this is always the answer: "Iunno. They're a big company, I like bitcoin...they should get involved and do something big."
The fact is there is nothing big to do there. What's required at this point is not on the tech side, the work there is either already done or incremental. It's on the usage side, and no company is going to move the needle there.

Actually my understanding is the old maps was done. What you saw was all that was left in the infrastructure it was running on. It would never pull in higher res satellite imagery, it would never have more throughput for submitted corrections, it would not be able to integrate with waze, etc. It was the most they could do with what they had, maybe some minor tweaks here and there, but in 10 years, you'd still be looking at basically the same product.
New maps is a rework of the entire thing from soup to nuts. So they had to drop some features that the new pipeline and rendering bits couldn't support, but the ability to integrate new things and scale more data is unlocked.
**tl;dr** one step back for maps, one giant leap forward for google kind.

Yea. I mean the only other possibility is that Vint Cerf, father of the Internet, might understand something you don't...which is patently ridiculous!
Anyway the idea that Google is not doing something in bitcoin because of any one guy–mid-level manager or Vint Cerf–is ridiculous. They've said they want to focus on moon shots that can fundamentally transform an area. Driverless cars fits that bill, wearable tech (when they first got into it), and bringing internet to the 5B.
How is being a bitcoin transaction processor going to move the needle? It's great tech, but there are a lot of companies moving in all kinds of interesting directions in the space. If they all had a big blind spot somewhere where Google could come in and go, hey, you guys need to look over here, that would be one thing ... but I don't think that's the case.
So, the question is: What exactly do people want to see Google do here?

To be fair the War on Drugs has in many ways been a war on mostly black and brown people, and it's even hard to argue this isn't intentionally so when you consider their historical disenfranchisement, economic policies that concentrate those people into ghettos, and then the War on Drugs comes along and makes crack cocaine a much more serious offense than powder cocaine (for example).
You're right that this doesn't mean you get to break laws that you consider unjust, neither does that *necessarily* make those laws just, however. Prosecuting someone under an unjust law is a much larger injustice than breaking an unjust law—this means we as a society have an obligation to take very seriously allegations of unjust laws.
It's also hard to argue that drug prohibition is for the "betterment of society" as you put it. Countries with liberal drug laws that embrace harm reduction seen to have much better outcomes for far less money than the US. When this even inadvertantly targets a certain skin color, I'd think this should give you pause.

You're talking about this case. I agree he's probably guilty and will be found so.

I'm 99% sure the air has gone out of that line of thinking since this whole thing was tried on the press by Ulbricht's counsel after he was arrested. His journal confirmed that he made a stupid mistake with the server and it was indeed sending responses for a short time on the network interface instead of using the for connection.
The people that reported it in the forums thought they were helping, but they were the ones that ended up publicizing the thing that brought down the site. They should have reported it to the admins directly and quietly.
I wonder why he didn't set up routing to forward all traffic sent to the naked network interface to the tor connection like tails does.

I totally agree with you on this, except for the "easily relock it" bit. All he had to do was shut his laptop lid and it would become inaccessible. The [takedown was designed entirely around keeping the laptop lid up]( (That's part 2, [part 1 here](
However, I will say that you're right in that operational security, if you're going to take it seriously, means you have to engage a whole ritual that almost everyone would find extreme and pretty fatiguing, and you'd have to keep probing it for weakness and fine tuning it when you find them. So perhaps it's a bit too glib to say he didn't understand or bother to use the tools correctly; actually, using such tools correctly is a huge and constant pain. The only way govt-backed spies do it (I mean, I'm guessing, I don't claim to know much about it) is by having a support network behind them.

This is interesting ... but does it make sense to take into account during sentencing any crimes other than the ones you've been found guilty of?
Look at it this way: Say the govt decides to go ahead now with the prosecutions for the hired hits, and they lose badly, and he's found not guilty.
Does that mean his sentencing will be revisited in light of the fact that these later trials undermined the basis for his punishment?

Well it's not really "reencrypting" anything, it's just destroying the decryption keys in memory. But I take your point, though it's unlikely those techniques would have worked against modern encryption there is a chance and given the stakes he should have been following better protocol.
Again though, with it without the journal I think he probably would have had the same outcome, it just would have taken a lot longer to get there maybe.

Again I'm not talking about his specific case, I'm only saying that the principle of innocent until proven guilty means the government shouldn't be able to punish you for things you haven't been convicted of. Is that controversial to you?
If not then it seems a bit strange that sentencing can be based on anything other than what you've been convicted of. I suppose the way they probably look at it is they're not doing that; once you're convicted they can hit you with the max and considering character can help lessen your sentence. If it can only help you, then I get how it's consistent with innocent until proven guilty. I just never thought about it before...
(BTW, if you've confused me for someone that thinks he should get off, don't. I think he got pretty much what he deserved based on the hits he almost certainly commissioned.)
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:56:06


He's not accused of that in this trial. See - 


You can tell what the government is afraid of by how harshly it punishes. I think this case made them–and everyone, really–realize just how powerless they are against the threat posed by what the SR represents.
According to the govt's case, in principle there's nothing preventing another SR AFAICT. Hence they're reduced to making the risk assessment weigh as heavily as possible on the side of government authority.

The analogy I like takes a bit more to lay out, but gives a lot more detail.
Imagine you share an apartment with roommates, and one roommate has the lease in his name. Every month, when the rent is due, you all send your contribution and that roommate pays the landlord.
Because you all live together, you find yourselves occasionally sharing other expenses. For example, someone's going to the store so everyone gives that person their shopping lists and that person picks it all up. You try to pay that person when they return, but they say, you know what, we're going to settle up the rent in a few days, let's just do it all then. So someone creates a shared spreadsheet, and everyone puts in what they owe and what they've paid up that point. At the end of every month, when the rent is due, you all settle up and no one owes anyone else.
After a few months, you all begin to realize that you don't really have to settle up when rent is due...that's kind of arbitrary. So whoever pays the rent that month just adds it to the sheet like any other expense (just like groceries).
The spreadsheet is bitcoin wallets. The blockchain is whatever process you define to ensure the data is accurate in the sheet. The apartment is the world, and your roommates are everyone.

As a casual follower of this whole intriguing tale, what is this bit about mycrimes.txt? I've never heard of this and I've been reading most of the articles along the way.
To anyone that has any respect for Ulbricht: find a new libertarian hero to worship. You don't need reasonable doubt to decide someone is too sketchy to follow; you only need that if you're the govt trying to put the man in jail, so stop confusing the two.
By that argument I could say we've all been way too hard on Capone, treating him like a drug kingpin mob boss when he really just failed to pay his taxes. And tax laws are too onerous anyway so who's really at fault amirite?

That's irresponsible, there might be some newbies out there that take your advice here without understanding.
**Newbies:** You don't need dist-upgrade *unless* you're outside the support window for your version (which is why you should only be on LTS unless you're willing to tinker) *and* that version is actually no longer being supported (many distros continue backporting security patches for unsupported distros for a long time...if you run Mint I believe they still unofficially backport security patches for every single version going back to 12 or something like that).
Just update and upgrade is fine for security patches.
You don't want to do dist-upgrade unless you've backed everything up and you actually want to do a major OS upgrade.

I posted on Greece elsewhere in this thread, take a look for it.
I've always thought setting an exchange rate of 1:1 in the Eurozone with no other supporting regulations was nutty.
This is essentially what being on the euro means, a Greek euro and a German euro are the same, even though they are separate economies and political entities for all intents and purposes. Again, I'll point out that this is yet another *similarity* between that situation and bitcoin.
And ask yourself, why is the collapse of the banking system in Greece bad? If I thought bitcoin was the solution to all the problems, I would tell Greece that this is a *positive* development provided they can stay on the euro. Think about it: Isn't a collapsed banking system on a shared currency exactly what you're advocating for here?
But of course this is obviously bad, and not just for Greece, it's also bad for Germany. This is the point: **No one** is benefiting from this arrangement, not the production engine of the Eurozone, not the country engaging austerity measures either. The best you can say about the euro right now is that if you're somewhere in the middle it's not hurting you.

Bitcoin certainly does this, same as cash. But there is a reason people don't like to use cash for everything. There are definite drawbacks to it.
Specifically, if you insist on total control over your money, that means it cannot be leveraged by anyone else while in your possession. Yes, there are risks associated with this, but most everyone on earth would characterize your position as an extreme one, that *no* risk is acceptable here.
It's also worth noting that in practical terms, it's unlikely bitcoin would ever actually achieve that "no risk" status. It's possible that as long as fiat currencies exist–which it is very likely they will for the indefinite future–the exchange rate to bitcoin can still play havoc by having inflationary effects.
It's also worth pointing out that you are talking about reducing risk to an absolute minimum in the context of holding a currency that nearly broke $1K a year ago but is now valued in the $200s. All such conversations that regard this as less of a problem than bank collapse are missing the huge national old growth forest for the tiny little saplings.
Again, I love bitcoin, I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying that it is not responsible to encourage others to hold a significant portion of their wealth in it. There are a lot of legimitate reasons to be excited about bitcoin, and this sub should focus on those. In the long run, this will be the best thing you can do to promote it, not this kind of uninformed stuff.

Economics and security are inexorably intertwined; I'm not confusing them, I'm recognizing the impact they have on one another.
You do sacrifice a little financial security when you participate in the economy by depositing your money in a bank, but you get a reward commensurate with your risk at the individual level. Does bitcoin pay an interest rate that's pegged to inflation, or does it just evaporate slowly?
You also get to participate in a society that has liquidity and free flow of capital to where it's most needed, you get to leverage the time value of money, etc. The advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.
Please understand me that I'm not taking an extreme position here that *no one* should *ever* hold bitcoin. It's digital cash. It makes sense to have bitcoin instead of cash wherever cash makes sense.
But there's a reason we're not a cash only economy. Take a look at Taiwan over the last several decades, it is basically a cash economy with very little credit. A few folks answered my question about buying a house with all these theoretical possibilities ... but they are missing one fact: These places actually exist on Earth. You need not speculate about what would happen, you need only look.
I don't want to live in a Taiwanese economy where no one can have a house until you can pay cash because no one trusts each other enough to pay back a loan. That is essentially what you are talking about...you're saying that people shouldn't trust each other regardless of the regulatory environment set up, do not loan money.
This is just a bad idea.

I think the example of Greece shows the danger of separate political entities (countries) agreeing to all fix their exchange rate when they: (a) don't have a fluid labor market that can easily shift around between countries and (b) don't have any special agreements around regulating import/export with each other.
Greece is the powder keg that had a big fuse put into it with the introduction of the euro. The situation now is that there were these economic ties put into place on the surface with no promise of actual underlying support between the players should anything like this go wrong, so now we see Germany acting in its own best interest because it simply doesn't want to carry the rest of the EZ, in particular Greece, anymore.
This cannot work long term. It's as if the states of the US decided there was going to be no financial ties (federal taxes paid and distributed across state boundaries) and no flow of labor over state borders, but they all wanted to keep the dollar.

That's nonsense—Linux isn't targeted because there's no profit in it *because* it's so secure. Linux (and other POSIX-compliant OSes) [run most of the Internet]( and a huge majority of the security space. IOW, all the high-value stuff worth attacking is behind a *nix box.
Most hackers don't care about attacking the desktop, because most valuable data isn't kept on the desktop. That's just what most people see so they accept that Windows is more targeted. No way, it's more targeted *on the desktop* because it's more prevalent and weaker.




10 years ago, I'm with you.
Today it's a totally different story. I have actually sat people down in front of Windows 8 and asked them to do simple tasks like write a short text doc in notepad or browse to google.com. 5 minutes later they're still staring at a blank desktop. Sit that person down in front of Linux Mint 17 on MATE or Cinnamon and no problem.
The one area where Linux has been lagging until recently is hardware compatibility. I freely admit I've always had a hard time getting my ragtag bunch of hardware and the crazy file systems I use set up. Once they're set up, they run reliably, but getting it going has always been a challenge.
Until Mint 17, that is. I have never had a more pleasant experience installing an OS on a dual head, ZFS file system, NAS over NFS, JBOD on RAID HD controller system with a Wacom tablet. I routinely would have trouble even getting some of this stuff set up on Windows. I can honestly say that I feel like Linux has finally gotten to a point of maturity on this where they can beat Windows on usability. I even just upgraded Mint 17.1 to 17.2 in place, it took 5 minutes and worked perfectly. I'd set aside several hours and I got a lot of reddit browsing done instead.
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:10:32


True, but again, irrelevant to this discussion. We're not comparing average user savvy, we're comparing straight OS security.




Because the exploits exist anyway. It's not extra effort to run an exploit against a desktop that would normally be used to pop an enterprise server ... it's already in your arsenal.

I don't count hacks that rely on user action as a "security issue". If I were securing a corporate network or something I would take this into account, of course, but for the purposes of this discussion this is more a comparison of users, not OSes. The test here is: Given equivalently capable users (that don't do things like install malware or open random attachments and execute them), is it easier to pop a Windows box or a Linux box?
Keep in mind that, as you say, this ignores the very big advantage Linux has over Windows in terms of the more techie user base, so this only makes my point harder to prove. But it still stands.


? Don't follow this. There are Windows skins for most linux distros that offer more or less the same UI.


10 years ago, sure, maybe even 5. But to be honest the expert blindness is on the Windows side now. There's so many things that people know about Windows simply because they've been using it since 3.1. The difference is that they tend to mistake "the way Windows does it" with "the way computers work"–the very definition of expert blindness. Take someone who's spent equal time using both, and see how they do on each. I submit they'll be more capable and find it simpler on Linux.
Take someone that's used Windows all their life everywhere they go and compare how productive they are with Linux 5 minutes after sitting down in front of it? This is the test of "user friendliness" that people typically have in mind. Even here, Linux does surprisingly well these days...but this is totally not rational.

This would murder liquidity. Most houses in existence would quickly have multiple owners making foreclosure an empty threat. Either that, or you have to let majority owners act as full owners, meaning few would bother to own much more than half.

Honestly, these things are not comparable. This bug executes arbitrary code on a Windows machine simply by visiting a website that loads a font.
Shellshock–though it was a security issue of the highest severity–was quite a bit more restricted than this. The most common shellshock exploit depends upon running a CGI-based web server.
First, you don't run a CGI-based web server if you're smart. CGI, lol. Second, if you do, it's in the DMZ as a front end server that doesn't have access to anything critical. Every other vector relied on having a compromised client accessing the target machine in a trusted way:
* DHCP on a wifi network for which you have the password, and unrestricted access to machines on that network. If you're smart, though, you don't give randoms access to your wifi network, and you don't get guests access to the other machines on your wifi network even when you do give them the password (run local firewalls people, router firewalls are necessary, but not sufficient)
* OpenSSH if the client can connect to the server and has been compromised. Trusted machines are trusted, this is not news.
The main reason this was such a huge deal is that ISPs are idiotic. They give you a locked down router that ... you guessed it ... runs a CGI based web server. *sigh* Even so, a compromised router would have a tough time doing any damage to machines on your network if you're running, say, ufw on each machine (as you should be, and as is default or equivalent on every linux distro I have personal experience with).

Replied elsewhere on this: Used to be this way, no longer is the case. Windows has fallen behind the curve in my experience, Linux is now easier to install, easier to admin.
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:56:40




What are we even debating then? My position is Linux is more secure than Windows, which you apparently agree with.




Yes, UX is more than UI. UI is just an example of better UX (linux provides simple options for users, Windows you're stuck with what you get). I know about tyranny of choice, that's why distros exist, and there's a small set of popular ones to choose from that solves this problem. (I mean, you basically have ubuntu or mint for starters, and if you want to go FreeBSD maybe. Outside of that, you're willing to confront the choices.)




Condescending yet noncommittal to any position that could be attacked. Reddit perfection!


I disagree; we absolutely agree.

What linux users aren't doing regular updates?
    $ sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade
In fact, I think I don't even have to do this because I think my distro automatically fetches and installs stable security updates several times a day.
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:16:45
Actually if you don't upgrade your kernel on linux, you pretty much never need to reboot. And it's only very rare that you need to upgrade a kernel for security reasons.

It's the opposite. Econ explains the fundamental mechanics of an economy you'd best not ignore lest you end up like Greece or 1930s US.
What we need is responsible government that tells hard truths when necessary and doesn't let the foxes rule the hen house.
The problem is that governments, *like bitcoin fanatics*, ignore the lessons of econ and history.

Careful. All https means is that no one can mess with your communications in flight—it doesn't mean the other endpoint is who they say they are. For that, the other endpoint needs to have an EV-SSL cert, or be "well known" and use a standard cert (you do have to make sure you're actually using HTTPS on the expected site, though...it's possible a MitM can intercept your request for google.com and send you over to an HTTP site using an sslstrip attack, which is addressed by HSTS, but in any case for a well known site like one of these just make sure you're on the expected domain and HTTPS).
For other sites that aren't well known, you'll want to see an EV-SSL cert, example: [grc.com]( See the URL bar has a big green badge with the corporation's name in it? That means you can click on that green badge and look at the connection tab and inspect the cert to ensure that it's the company you think it is.
BTW, just for general interest (not really applicable to your specific question here), if you want to know if a site has HSTS in Chrome, go to chrome://net-internals/ and query the domain in the bottom query box. (Do **not** put it in the top box, this *adds* it to the HSTS list for your browser, which you don't want to do.)
Another way to see this (again, in Chrome), is go to a site with HSTS (facebook) and open the Developer tools panel. Click the Network tab and then just over the timing graph click XHR (or Documents). In the left nav below the graph find a page that is not just passing parameters, like on facebook.com it would be "bz" or "user_info" or any of those, and click it. On the right side, click Headers and look through the Response headers section for Strict-Transport-Security. If it's there, congrats, the response you got from that site has HSTS and it's working. (If you see "preload" at the end of that header like you should for Facebook, that means that it's one of the well known sites that your browser is aware at install uses HSTS.)

Of course the price matters, but a slow, long term decline isn't necessarily bad. It could just be a sign that the insane price before was a bubble.
This happens in markets where there is no good way (or no incentive) to short. Go back a year or two...if you believed bitcoin was going to drop from its peak, how would you capitalize on it? Move your money into dollars? That's what literally *everyone* is doing.
Without some mechanism providing downward pressure, big moves up followed by long, slow spirals down will happen whenever a significant fraction of actual bitcoin buyers are feeling overly optimistic.
Ultimately you want the price to reflect its real value to the market. If it is overvalued right now, if you're concerned about the long-term health of it, you want it to adjust. And, you probably do want a gradual correction that plays out over time rather than a sudden crash. But none of these are good options, what you really want is the ability to short so that the market reflects real value from now on.
@_date: 2015-04-19 07:42:12
No I think it's an attempt to gain credibility to show you have some skin in the game. How many people that post their bitcoin holdings would be bragging if that was their entire net worth?

Yes! UTC is not a time zone, it's a scientific standard for measuring time. It never deviates from mean solar time measured from the equator by more than 1 second. (Solar time slows down as the Earth's rotation slows, which is happening all the time.)
GMT is a time zone, which is not scientifically defined but rather a political boundary. To avoid adding leap second at irregular intervals in order to maintain correspondence with solar time, GMT allows larger deviations and adds bigger leap units less frequently.
For all practical purposes, they are very close and can be treated interchangeably, but they are not the same.

You make it sound as if I have an agenda here beyond simply having a discussion. I think most people on reddit are just here for discussion.


You seem happy to ignore the expansionist tendencies of every other country in order to serve the imperialist narrative.
Is there abuse of human rights at any scale that would in your mind warrant a military response? Continuation of slavery, genocide, the ongoing existence of North Korea—in each and every case you would assert that the world would be better off if not for US intervention?

It sounds like you're saying credit cannot be useful for public entities like governments or the societies they govern because it's fraught with too many pitfalls.
While I agree that the current state of the US has stepped into some of those—and they're not examples of being responsible—that doesn't mean public entities can't ever be responsible with credit.
In a lot of ways we used credit to finance the Civil War, which I think was worth fighting, as well as WWII. From spurring the creation of the railroad in the case of the former to countless technologies in the case of the latter, wars that are fought for the right reasons can be a tremendous boon to humanity in many ways.
I don't think it is different between public and private, actually. Credit doesn't much care if it's an irresponsible country, small business owner, or even a household, it pretty much behaves the same way. How to get to responsible decisions is different in each case, but the basic mechanism isn't.
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:15:44
Actually, we are becoming so automated that we may not be seeing "creative destruction"–we may be seeing [technological unemployment](
Think about driverless cars. There is a significant number of jobs in the economy concerned with shipping and transportation. When these are automated out of existence, where will that percentage of the working public go? Will there suddenly spring up 20% of the economy's jobs to take their place? Probably not.
This is a trend that's been accelerating since the Industrial Revolution. Prior to that, it was common for families to spend generations in the same trade. In the mid-1800s, this began to change and people would normally spend their career in one profession. Then it was maybe a a dislocation once or so per generation. Now it's common to experience two or three dislocations in a typical career, and kids being born now may spend more time dislocated and training for the next thing than actually working.
It's coming. There's no point resisting it, but it will upturn our political systems. We need to be ok with people being paid for not working.
@_date: 2015-03-29 19:54:58


This isn't strictly true. If an economy is growing, a country can borrow against future growth to finance something right now. As long as the ratio of growth to deficit spending is healthy, there will still be plenty left for the next generation.
You might say that this is still immoral because the future generations should get all of the growth. Well, this is somewhat less clear even on its face—why should the future generations benefit by default for the growth the current generation is responsible for? But even if you discount that moral question, economically speaking: *What if future growth isn't possible without the current financing?*
It's well accepted that credit economies are much more effective if that credit is used responsibly. This is because it's credit drawn against future production that wouldn't exist without the investment now. Good economic planning that sustainably increases production is hard to argue against because it just creates more for everyone.

Not being flippant. You wrote:


So, it's ok for individuals to go to war against invaders or their government. I gather that you think it's not ok for the government of those individuals to go to war for any reason. Hence, the only war you support is when the people fighting are anarchistic. Did I get that wrong?


You would honestly say it's not worth going to war against regimes like Khmer Rouge, the Nazis, or genocidal dictators like Milosevic? Of course pragmatism has to enter into it when deciding such things, but to say that in principle you don't support force to stop obvious abuses is not a morally serious position. How can you have so little empathy for the victims?
@_date: 2015-03-30 06:52:08


True. We're in agreement so far.


This is incredibly reductive. Stopping Hitler required mass killing, and there was economic upside to it. The Allies shouldn't have fought that war?

The one thing you cannot say about CP Grey is that he makes arguments from lack of imagination.

I intend to watch it because it looks interesting. At work now though.


This removes a bit too much responsibility from the Axis. You're saying the US put Japan in a position where it had no choice but to attack Pearl Harbor? Hitler had no choice but to take over Europe and scapegoat the Jewish people?
The problem much of the time with US foreign policy is that we don't forthrightly stand for the principles on which the country is founded, we often lose sight of what's right in lieu of what we can get done. You may argue, and apparently are arguing, that our motivations were impure, but you may not say that those same actions (in the large) could not have come from a right place. In the end that's what matters... you are what you do, not what you say.


Defense of others. I would've thought this would be obvious from the example of North Korea, so I'll ask again: Do you really mean to argue here that allowing this regime to continue existing for so many decades is a net good because it avoided conflict at the time?
You can continue avoiding the question but I take that to be a pretty loud response in its own right.
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:15:44




No, not at all. It's not worth resisting because it *is* people's will.
No matter who you are, when your turn to become dislocated comes, you'll be in the minority. And, the dislocation ultimately makes sense because you are not as efficient and cost-effective as whatever your automated replacement. It cannot be a bad thing if more is produced for less toil.
Many of the environmental problems we have today, for instance, are due to inefficiency. Who wants to use an electric vehicle when you have to stop every 4 hours and charge it for 10? With self drivers, this is not really a showstopper as it is with human drivers, though, is it? I mean, it's still worth reducing as much as possible ... but if we self drivers had become 10 years ago instead of 5 years from now, the electric car never would have died back then. The fact is when automation is abundant, we can have all of what we want with less impact that ever.
The problem we ought to confront is not, "Should we let this happen?" but rather, "How should the abundance be shared?" This is the *right* problem to solve.
There is a not-insignificant risk of all of the wealth accumulating in the hands of the few that happen to be in a position to control the companies that carry out the transition. But when 90% of the workforce is dislocated due to automation, does it really make sense for all of the wealth to accumulate in the hands of the few owners? (Keep in mind, they're not really working anymore anyway ... the day-to-day tasks of their job has been automated in this world too. All they literally do for the most part is own stuff.)
The early entrants for social order are ideas like [guaranteed minimum income]( and [basic income]( How we structure our societies to deal with technological unemployment will probably be humanity's next great challenge.
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:13:35
You and I have a fundamental disagreement. I tend to think that motivations are of secondary importance, what matters is what you do.
When it comes to governments this is a great simplifier, as it's impossible to really understand what the motivations of a country are. Even in the simplest situations there are so many people involved in different ways there no meaningful average. At the end of the day, the question I ask is: Could this have been done from a good place?

When your wallet gets hacked, how long does it take to see the funds disappear?
It seems to me that a good business would be creating lots of wallets with change in them and then using several different methods of transacting to see which ones get emptied. Compile a security report.
Course hackers could ignore small amounts / only target wallets with lots of money so as not to tip their hand...

I probably won't have time for awhile to watch the video, but I caught the first few minutes and I think I get the gist of it.
Allow me to grant it all. Say the US avoided diplomacy with the Axis powers. Say it was an economic boon to the US, and the destruction of these economies was a great loss for the world. How is any of this a counterargument to what I said?
You'll have to draw a few straight lines here for me. It seems to me you're arguing that WWII didn't have to happen, or at least US involvement was somehow tainted. What responsibility does the US bear in creating the situation they were responding to by way of the response?
I fear my larger point may have escaped you, though. You said:


This is just flat-out wrong. Are you willing to say that were the conditions right for it, given what we now know about the way things have gone on the Korean peninsula, a bit more destruction in the early 50's would have been a net loss had it prevented North Korea?
The video you provided notwithstanding, all your work is still in front of you.
