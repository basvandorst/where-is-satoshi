I see this sub as a wealth of information for those trying to get into a new technology. There is no “too late”. Are you going to be a millionaire overnight with a $100 purchase today. No, but if bitcoin keeps going up you will make some return on your investment. Sounds like the only one here butthurt is you, feeling the need to make a post calling out a whole sub because you either don’t believe in Bitcoin or you don’t understand it.

I believe Bitcoin will be a store of value and coins like Litecoin will be used as payment systems with atomic swaps and cheaper transaction fees.

I see a lot of talk about bitcoin price correcting as money flows back into alts post fork. No one knows what’s going to happen. I’m waiting until after the fork to buy more. Just my take on it, best of luck!

Bitcoin jr. twice the fees and half the speed

I think we will hit 10k before futures news hits. I don’t think futures will give us too much of a bump, but I do believe we are overdo for a 30-45% correction, then after that we will start climbing  to a new ath.
