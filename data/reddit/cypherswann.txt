Closed my savings account, transferred every penny to DAI and earning compound interest of approximately 5%-15% APR per year. Not looked back since. 
My bank now holds spending/bills money only - rest gets migrated to DAI (SAI) 
If like me, you hate banks giving you 0.2-1.0% return per year, check out compound interest on stable coins.

I've devoted most of my portfolio into Ethereum blockchain, in addition to DAI and earning compound interest per day, with a large portfolio. Tezos I've been 'pumping' into, recently with off profits from compound interest going into that sector, to earn additional % return (as the return on DAI now is approx 4%) I've always loved bitcoin but always went into alternative cryptos as I found more use for them! As in blockchain gaming, purchasing items ect - I own the equivalent in ETH in a couple bitcoins, but would love to follow the same footsteps as OP

Gotcha, so it's the KYC policy, honestly an exchange site owner would get rinsed horribly if they don't comply with local government.
Somone needs to develop a decentralised exchange site peer-2-peer one-2-1 transactions on a network that cant be altered or amended. But then again, no profit for the coder

What leads people to use 'suspicious' exchange sites to begin with? Anything new or suspicious in regards to exchanges is a complete no go, I dont understand why their is a market for them when sites like binance are avaliable. 
Not a hate post, just generally curious why their is a market for these new exchange sites with higher fees and not better accountability?

pumping all my crypto into Tezos, still dream of owning a full bitcoin one day!

what fucks me, is I deposited 10ETH into coinbase pro, deposit is confirmed and shows in my coinbase pro deposits. 
Yet no access to the funds in my account, so - was unable to sell. 
WTF
