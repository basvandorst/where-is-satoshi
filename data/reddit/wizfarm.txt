Mac Wizard Service is now accepting Bitcoin and BlackCoin for services. We have been providing the best customer service experience for over 5 years, and what better way to keep up with the future but to accept BlackCoin. BlackCoin is a new form of digital currency that our company is accepting. Unlike Bitcoin, BlackCoin is the first hybrid POW/POS alt coin to hit the Proof of Stake only stage. Due to the Proof of Stake System transactions get confirmed super quick. BlackCoin regularly has a first confirmation in 10 seconds flat. Since BlackCoin does not accept Proof of Work after the 10,000th block mining is not possible anymore. This makes BlackCoin highly energy efficient. We hope to be in continued support of our customers locally and nationwide and look forward to welcoming our new BlacKCoin customers to our Mac Wizard Service Family. Take advantage of our solid state upgrades, video card repair, memory upgrades we do it all and for all our BlackCoin family, we will be giving out a 10% Discount on all our services..
Check Out our BlackCoin Memeber Card, Coming Soon, You will be able to order your Cold Storage card here.
