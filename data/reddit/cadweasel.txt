Its so much cheaper because its just an empty case filled with lies.

It also has a USB port, can be used as PCI-e or standalone USB device.

It looks like someone did get theirs:

Thanks for sharing!

Looks more like 222 BTC:

Activate Disco mode?

Be warned that Butterfly Labs does not support reselling of pre-orders and will not ship the product to a third party. They will only ship to the original order's address. I saw some FPGA machines on eBay at 400 Mh/s and 800 Mh/s but the prices were insane.  It would take 6 months or more just to make your money back, if you're lucky.

I assume you also received the email telling you to log in and confirm your order or it will be cancelled. I panicked a bit too and tried to log in to do so. I did not see the popup like others did that gave me the option to confirm my order or cancel. After clicking on everything I could find I still had no popup. I even tried a different computer and browser just in case, same result. I ended up submitting a ticket stating my case. The next day I logged back in and I did get a popup stating that I did not need to confirm since the popup was intended for earlier orders (from last year). So, in conclusion, if you log in to BFL and your status says "Processing" you are good to go.

They will scan the barcode on the electronic image displayed on your phone by the Gyft app.

You're welcome. It seems that ASICs are the only way to go if we are going to remain in the mining business. Now its just a waiting game for the actual hardware to be delivered. It's a good thing I am a very patient man.

Gyft just implemented purchases in Canada through their Beta webpage: 
@_date: 2013-05-25 01:49:22
Thanks for confirming. That's a  good point.
@_date: 2013-08-20 00:15:05
Go to Gyft, get an Amazon Gift card and order the equipment from [Amazon](
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:38:41
I have already used Gyft to buy Amazon gift cards, money well spent.
@_date: 2013-05-25 04:22:14
Perhaps yours is an earlier order, before they increased the price.
@_date: 2013-08-18 01:19:20
What exactly do you get for the transfer? More hashing power? The equivalent to what you had already ordered? They don't say, other than you will wait at least another 4 months. No thanks, Ill take my order sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2013-09-07 19:28:08
Use gyft.com for international purchases of Amazon gift cards.
@_date: 2013-05-25 01:30:39
Check again in 48 hours.

This reminded me of the [Ferengi Rules of Acquisition  "Once you have their money, you never give it back."](
@_date: 2013-05-31 20:16:20
Me too. I'm all in.
@_date: 2013-06-12 00:01:38
Gyft has zero fees.

I had commented 6 days ago and I heard that Gyft was allowing purchases in Canada using the Beta webpage. So like a good redditor, I wanted grant your wish. *"Unfortunately, Gyft isn't available in Canada. I wish it was."* Here, let me sprinkle some pixie dust too while I'm at it. Now think happy thoughts...
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:31:17
Did you get it at gunpoint?
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:33:24
Spend your Bitcoins on Amazon gift cards using Gyft and get anything you want, no cash needed.
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:35:58
Welcome to the club.
@_date: 2013-05-26 13:49:26
Apparently this offer was not supposed to go live yet, it has been removed from the website.

No, it didn't change mine. "Add 2 GH/s to your order. Click here now!" Will upgrade your miner from 5 Gh/s to 7 Gh/s for $100.
