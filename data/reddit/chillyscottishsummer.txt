Thanks so much :D

This is awesome. Withdrawals are free at the moment so just waiting to receive the full amount to my wallet. I'll send it back asap. Can you send me your address?

Once I'm all set up and confident I'm going to transfer my wallet over to my Raspberry Pi. Cheers!

OK would I be better with a Linux VM on my machine? Everything is backed up from my computer to an external hard drive

Haha nope further north in Aberdream! ;) Do you know if they will send bitcoin in store or is it online only?

130 bit thanks very much :)

Well I say significant, I mean like less than 1BTC. I have a bunch of junk around my flat I don't use anymore and I've found a shop that buys stuff for BTC. Going to head over and trade them in.
Thanks for the tip though!

Literally just set my first wallet up yesterday... can't believe how easy it has been and how generous everyone is. Loving bitcoin! :D

Thank you sir :)

I'm not sure my tip sent properly. Did you get it?
@_date: 2014-05-29 22:53:36
Yay! Long way to go though :)
Another question...is changetip.com website only or do they have any apps? Its a bit slow and choppy on my HTC One. At first glance I don't see anything in the Play store.
@_date: 2014-05-29 22:26:55
I've already withdrawn it from my changetip account. Gimme a minute while I put it back in
