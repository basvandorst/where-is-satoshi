Something tells me it's easier to find a parking space in your Brighton.

Yup - I had a lot more btc than now. Spent most of it when it stagnated. Wisdom comes with expensive fuckups but I still have my awesome mouse &amp; mousepads. All the drugs are long gone though :(
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:00:35
And fuck all you complex people! Ain't got no time fo your shit.

If anyone's interested I could tweet when I buy and sell. As long as you do the exact polar opposite you're bound to make money.

The second one looks the busiest. Good luck and research properly before buying and setting up a wallet.

This is the best explanation of the divide I've seen in the two weeks I've spent trying to figure out just wtf is going on. I very much appreciate the time you took to comment. You remind me of old reddit.

Is everyone here from Brighton?

 He may be fucking nuts but it's still my favourite bitcoin price tracker.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:01:15
Okay thanks.

[This is now my one of my favourite BTC price trackers](

You're not alone. I derped the same derp.
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:52:08
Nope. Not yet. The original dev of bitcoin had quantum computing in mind though, so it will just be a question of changing to a tougher cryptographic algorithm when it's necessary to do so.

HELP HIM!
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:32:37
No they still qualify as exchanges even though you can spend directly from them. Ideally you want a wallet where you can control your own keys AND back up your wallet safely.

@_date: 2017-06-28 20:58:27
Did you hear how they managed to get away?
They ran somewhere.
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:00:08
This is awesome! Congratulations.
@_date: 2013-12-22 03:57:29
Ooh, thanks! Reading the intro, however, the Welsh guy mined the bitcoins in 2009 but threw the drive out in [August or something in 2013](

Interesting: I'd immediately thought of that article when Kaminsky called the code "alien".
For anyone that hasn't read it: read it.
@_date: 2013-04-21 07:42:51
That's crazy money. Will they make that back?

Oops. Ducking android keyboard.

Interesting. [E.D. link here for anyone else](
Look under "Why is this shit back?" section.

My university landlord told me that a previous tenant had eaten nothing but flapjacks for months after spending his grant and had contracted scurvy.
[I now doubt the veracity of his tale.](

Don't forget the opensource [redreader beta]( that released 3 weeks ago. It's a great reddit browser and it's dead interesting watching it grow.
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:16:35
Apparently the typos in phishing emails are too weed out intelligent responders.

Thankyou! As soon as Bitcoin for Dummies comes out I'm buying a copy.

Not your fault - never has been. Also I believe the only way to properly kill a meme is for people to downvote and [humour police]( them.

Yes - for you can't buy drugs with beer.

Tell that to Descartes.

You could check out localbitcoins.com. You can often find a local seller that will trade coins for cash. Depends on your location, of course. There are sellers on ebay but I think you'll need to have been pretty active there for trust reasons.

Haha - it couldn't be about reddit without someone spotting a typo:


Great stuff though - very readable. Have you looked at the locus coeruleus? It seems to be a brain structure linked with novelty perception. It also responds to shock and squirts out norepinephrine. I'm guessing it may be quite active in spacedicks subscribers. You *do* have a spacedicks chapter, I trust?
