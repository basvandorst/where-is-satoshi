Even if he diversified, say 50%, then it's still only a small percentage &amp; he still has A LOT to loose.

Me too, man. remembered for us.

I had nothing to contribute until I read that part. Thought it was worth sharing.

IMHO it's obvious that he's playing on people's heart strings when in reality he's doing damage control since he's heavily invested in it. Common sense. 
Think "House of Cards"

Mintspare is great!

Yes! Thank you for sharing. All upvotes to you!

Thought the info was worth sharing. It read more of a cult-like speech to me.

What is the design style called that your website uses? Anybody know?

That's all fine and dandy but, this is written like cult leader preaching to his minions. This is EXACTLY like how Peter Schiff champions gold 24/7 because guess what? He's highly invested in the stuff.

124k bitcoins x $520 = $64.48M
Losses are 550 bitcoins x $520 = $286k
So he lost 0.44% of his bitcoins. 
Obvious agenda is obvious.

In my (major) city, the cabbies jacked up the rates too during halloween. They wanted a flat fee of $40 for a $15 ride. I pulled out my phone, got a little higher rate from uber saying it would be $20, accepted, and got picked up in a minute. 
Hardly a "fine example." The price was already agreed upon before me even entering the cab.

If it's infinitesimal to your current holdings, then yes.

The new IRS 'leaker' read like he was shilling (astroturfing) for the IRS under the guise of a "leak"

Uber didn't "nail" anyone. You have to manually type in how much extra you're willing to spend &amp; it graphs out the exact ride you're going to to take &amp; the exact cost. 
Prefect free market capitalism is more like it. Supply &amp; demand

the style has a name though... I'm hoping somebody who knows the answer will reply

That's exactly what they did when they voted to kick the can down the road

My heart goes out to the elderly in Greece. They are the ones most helpless in this situation. They can't work, move away, or anything. Many will starve, many will be emotionally broken, and many will die. That's the reality and it needs to be understood. 
Fuck the Greek leadership (and the people who voted for them) for allowing this to happen. The writing has been on the wall for a long time...

As long as the US is the world reserve currency and people seemingly don't give a crap about that the FED is buying up 80% of bonds, I'm not so sure.

At least the kids can work and/or flee
