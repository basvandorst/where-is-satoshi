This is actually a great use of trolling and isn't necessarily Anti-Daddy. Read for yourself:

Do you know anyone who would rewrite this assignment in python?

Sorry you lying sick minded troll but I'm not a "fundy", though I do like to have fun.

Yet again I embarrass myself with a knee-jerk retort. I'm only tangentially familiar with Steven Pinker, and though I wish he wasn't an atheist (I've become a traditionalist because of Alasdair MacIntyre), Pinker's work is interesting and useful to me, so now there's a lot more stuff I need to add to my reading list (or I can just watch TED:) 
Halloran's presentation is brilliant and well produced, but I think more needs to be explored, and I believe a lot of answers are in the archives of the former East Germany, but that's beside the point and we'll never see it anyway. 
My whole contention and Ron Paul's is that the most if not all the violence between nations last century were the result of the FED and other centralized fiat economies. And the bottom line is once governments relinquish their monopoly over the money supply and allow for competing currencies wars of almost every kind won't be so profitable for the few at the top. 
Keep in mind that a full-scale nuclear war will make all of these previous calculations meaningless and everything up to that point will have lead to it. At least that's the way I see it at the moment.

Thanks for breaking that down. I never even accessed their blocks page before and this encourages me to get up to speed on bitcoin if I want to play around with it a little more seriously.

Yeah, I believe you &amp; Steven Pinker, so how many people were killed by governments in the 20th Century again?

Thanks for the link.

It always cracked me up in the movie Beetlejuice that suicides became civil servants in the afterlife.

Could you please elaborate I have a vested interest in this.

Is there an an easy answer to explain why something like that happens?

You haven't lived until you've lost 100k or more on investments. Gloating over 26k (which is probably a lie) just means that you're a little girl that might never grow up and certainly will never acquire meaningful wealth because for that to happen you'd have to have some friends.

Prayer to St. Raphael to Intercede for Those Contemplating Suicide
Holy Archangel Raphael, appointed by God to guide, protect and heal, I entrust to you all people who at this moment are contemplating suicide. You guided young Tobias on his journey and protected him from the spirit of death which sought to destroy his life. I ask you to protect all people from the road that leads to physical and spiritual death, especially those in most danger of despair and suicide. Just as you led Tobias by the hand, lead them away from the sadness of addiction to peace and joy. O holy Raphael, whose name means, “God has healed”, bring them the Lord’s healing. Lord God, hear the prayer I make together with your faithful servant Raphael. Amen.
St. Raphael, pray for us!
St. Amabilis, pray for us!
St. Benedict Labre, pray for us!
St. Jude, pray for us!
St. Rita, pray for us!
St. Margaret of Cortona, pray for us!
St. Christina the Astonishing, pray for us!
St. Dymphna, pray for us!
St. Philomena, pray for us!
St. Giles, pray for us!
St. Joseph, pray for us!
All you holy saints and angels of God, pray for us!
Our Lady of Sorrows, pray for us!
Holy Trinity, one God, have mercy on us.

Coinbase is awesome until you have a problem with their verification system and you can't login to your account. That can get some folks bent out of shape. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:32:32
Instead of having Coinbase send an SMS choose to have them call the number to supply the verify code. It's worked for me in when I wasn't getting the text message over the phone.
