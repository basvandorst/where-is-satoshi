"Some have argued the opportunity for individual investors in cryptocurrencies has passed, since large hardware is now available for large investors to purchase and mine coins on a much **faster**, larger scale"
(my boldface)
Ummm, not faster! It's the same speed, or it would be an inflationary currency. The writer does not get it, unfortunately.

Sounds good. However:
1) Destroy the USB memory stick that you use to store the bitaddress.org page off-line, after having used it. USB sticks can monitor stuff (ok, being paranoid here)
2) Booting a LiveCD/LiveUSB kind of sets the random number generator in the same state for all people doing so. It might be that the hardware compensates for this, not sure. There is a package called randomsound for many Linux distros that seeds the random number generator with the least significant bit of the noise in your microphone. However then there is the question of if that module works on your setup and is coded correctly of course.
I would advise that you use dice instead and input that into your local bitaddress copy. Throw 99 times (this covers almost the entire key space) and enter the result (subtract one from each throw to get base6 notation) directly into the bitaddress local page. Bitaddress.org supports base6 input automatically

Yeah, I feel your pain. I put up a virtual machine with btcd on and it hasn't synced for many days. Currently it processes one block every 30 seconds or so and is currently in November 2013. I expect it to sync in two to three weeks.

All dice are good enough (for the purpose at hand) if you throw them 99 times. Imagine that your die turns up "5" 50% of the time. That would be a die that is so loaded that it must basically lack sides and have the same number printed on more than one side.
For such a die the most likely sequence to turn up is 99 5s in a row. The probability of that is 0.5 ** 99, which translates to a probability of about 1.6*10^-30. And that is the probability for the most likely sequence. Good enough.

Couldn't one have everyone hash their comments in javascript, and require a number of leading zeroes, that is a proof of work? This would require a bit of CPU work from every poster. 
On submitting, the server would then re-hash and verify, and if it is not verified, it doesn't get posted.
Before submitting, an AJAX call to the server makes sure the hash is unique (so you can't spam with identical comments) so you don't have to submit in vain, but that you need to change your text a bit. User name is included in the hashed text.

Unusually bad quality for being The Economist. And Ripple unnecessarily mentioned, and is said to be a blockchain company, although their concept of a blockchain is something else than what bitcoin uses. 
Furthermore, the mining process is not explained accurately:


There is so much wrong in that description it's hard to know where to start:


Uhm, no. It's not the same block, each miner is free to select what transaction it includes


Well, that happens when blocks are added *after* the mined block


It is not a new blockchain, it is a new block in the existing blockchain. And it's not the "blockchain". It is the blockchain. Why put it in quotes? He doesn't do so with the words "miners", "computers", "consensus".

"20Mb blocks just make this attack 20x more expensive, which is still trivial to a true enemy of Bitcoin"
No, that is not trivial. A 10% increase may be trivial, but a change of 20x is larger than one order of magnitude, and is not trivial.
Attacks that are just feasible with a 1MB limit are impossible with a 20MB limit. If you can get an order of magnitude somewhere in your code, as a programmer you are very happy, and that magnitude will help with all other kinds of defenses.
All other things equal an attacker must spend 20x the money, which if it goes from say $200,000,000 to $4,000,000,000 is a rather big difference.

Chromaway has some colored coin implementations: 
* Cuber handling Euros together with LHV Bank in Estonia
* Funderbeam (startup market).

It does not run flawlessly under Node.js, so a bit more attention to the code is needed to evaluate that code base.

We have built iOS/Android wallets for a particular use-case of colored coins for a customer, but in order to do a general wallet there is javascript web wallet code here that can be of use: 
It is not adopted for phone use via Phonegap/Cordova right now, but it should not be hard to do it, I have been told now.
I will actually run that right away and see what it does (not one of the projects I have been working on ).

Thanks for the info ! A podcast is one of the worst ways of sharing precise information; it would be great if there was some text describing it. I take it on your word that there are no obstacles left that would prevent a two-way peg from actually working, but I would still like to see just one implementation in the wild where it actually works, even if it is not the one that will be chosen, with whatever changes to script needed for that demo.

Cool! I got 99 six-sided dice. The process of throwing dice to generate random-enough numbers is incredibly resistant to tampering. When you raise something to the power of 99, it does not matter that much if the dice are imperfect. 
Imagine that your die turns up "5" 50% of the time. That would be a die that is so loaded that it must basically lack sides and have the same number printed on more than one side.
For such a die the most likely sequence to turn up is 99 5s in a row. The probability of that is 0.5^99, which translates to a probability of about 1.6*10^-30. And that is the probability for the most likely sequence. Good enough!

Even if the bias is known and shared I cannot see it being a problem in this context. If you can explain why it is, I would be happy to listen.

If the most likely sequence is very, very unlikely, why would it be horribly insecure? I fail to see that. If you can explain that, I would be happy to listen.

Thanks for your answer. I believe though that my math checks out. The crux is that with enough throws, even a very loaded die provides enough entropy. Now just focusing on the number 5 and a probability of 50% as I do, is simplified compared to any real world scenario. However I'd gather such high probability for the most likely number is extreme and would be detected.
Any other probabilities in a real world die  such as nearby sides coming up, would be lower. Think of it as a set of possible outcomes of 99 throws, where the most likely is 1.6 * 10^-30. Any other outcome is &lt; 1.6 * 10^-30 . Hence even if the probability distribution is skewed, the most likely outcomes are still extremely unlikely.
When it comes to being influenced by previous results, well I have as I wrote further up bought 99 dice. Actually more out of laziness, since throwing 1 die 99 times is tiresome.

Would it be possible for you to provide some kind of transparency to this? The video I saw on your site was not subititled and the only thing I could judge you on is that 494 people like you on facebook. It is sad to say, but it would be relatively easy to create a scam site.
