I would prefer BTC, but I would take the USD too. Honestly, anything is better than what I am expecting (Nothing).

If this is real, at least the image referred to is [encouraging](

Personally, I don't think the Mt. Gox situation is the same at all, though it is possible.
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:35:28
I'm afraid you are probably correct.

What if another bitcoin was created? As in, the same idea, but not actual bitcoins, an entire new network. It can be the steamcoin.

Basicly, you sign up using referral system, referrer and referred member each get .1 bitcoin. (Note, you must authorize email and mobile number)
Here's my referral link:

The request is for the purchase price, not the name

It's MtGox that has so many problems, not bitcoins.

Ah, well, lucky you. I believe I am stuck with sell orders at low prices, and probably won't be able to cancel them unless they do another 12 hour delay.

More time of no trading fees, and another new hardware transition, I guess. Maybe some Amazon hosting this time?

What if it printed out a little receipt with the code?

Oops, meant to say have the other person email them. Anyway, good luck.

In reality, no exchange should have over 30% of the market, possibly even 20%. We just need more secure, easy to use, exchanges.

This post makes no sense to me... Anyone care to explain?

Yes. If Coinbase in itself became an exchange or offered near instant purchases and sales (possibly from a number of different exchanges) then it would certainly be my preferred service to buy and sell bitcoins.

The 80% that used to use it needs to go lower than 50% in my opinion.

I imagine it will have a ton of rising and falling when it relaunches again.

~~Have you finished downloading the blockchain? Don't expect it before that.~~
Nevermind... I'd just email Coinbase, I've had problems there before.

I looked for old bitcoins too. I only found .067 though.

Yes, this! I would love an action figure with every bitcoin purchase..
