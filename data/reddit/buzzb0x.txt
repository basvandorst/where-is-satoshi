Even if you learn to code, your fork must valet accepted by a majority, as apparently the current developers don't give a s* about community dev.

The paper wallet contains the private key to retrieve the Bitcoin. He can either add the paper wallets address to his own wallet or transfer the funds to another of his addresses.

Anybody can contribute but lead developers choose which contribution is added to the main program.

You can't do this, everybody who would have scanned the code could have access to the 1000$.

But why are the lead developers so closed to a block-size increase?

Thanks for the answer :) Seems strange to prohibit debate…

Ah this is such an interesting subject! But well yeah I'm doing some research and the way core devs react can be truly seen as strange… XT seems reasonable. I've read every single Satoshi Mail and he wasn't against that kind of centralization where nodes are operated by larger entities and individuals use lightweight wallets.

Not bad, some English mistakes, but great idea :)

I love this project so much! Interesting read but it's not something like a roadmap haha. It's just a fact that Ethereum is trying to be so universal that this Bitcoin could be used as fuel.
