Will you tell it?

So it turns out coinbase will let you buy in Canadian dollars. So no exchange fees for cad to usd. BUT you can't withdraw your money. Lol. You can send it to an exchange that supports Canadian withdrawals, or deal with their extremely slow customer support. 
Money goes in, never comes out. I want to run that business!

How would the govt even know how much you made (unless you cashed out)?  Apparently all is lost.

The real joke is always next to the intended one.

Bodog is supposed to be a reputable site.  They’re one of the bigger gambling websites. I don’t think I’d have these issues with a credit card and providing all personal info. I think they get sketched out over crypto / don’t know how to deal with it. Case in point - the customer service person asked how much I deposited. So I checked my wallet to see how much crypto went out, but they needed it in FIAT. How am I supposed to remember the fiat they got on their end? it doesn’t match what my wallet exchange is showing.

I gave them $10 and didn’t want to give personal info, which they don’t really need anyway. I’m not up to anything shady, I wanted to see what happens. I would hardly call that fraud. 
I never give personal info of any kind. For frivolous things like this. Their systems will get hacked some day and then all your info gets out.

This is kind of my fear too. What if the seeds don’t work when you actually need them?
But I can’t help you as I don’t know anything. One time my electrum was acting up so I installed a new version and it solved the problem.

I guess it’s a bit more anonymous than using credit card and is not easily discovered. Yes you could inspect the ledger but all you’d find is where i bought the coins and then you’d have to figure out which user on that platform bought them., or if you bought them from one of those bitcoin atms you’d actually be quite anonymous. 
This is not perfect but better than traditional methods. Maybe if you’re paying for state secrets more anonymity would be good, but this is great middle ground, so I decided to experiment. The security only needs to be sufficient for the thing being protected.

They look good, but probably taste like whiskey and smell like a brick of hash.

Ok but are they actually sourced from Joe Rogan?  I’d pay more for those.

I didn’t get charged luckily.  Just checked my credit card.

Is this why they’re so good at soccer?

There’s  a shitty Bitcoin atm near my work. They take way too much off the top last time I saw bitcoin at $10K they were exchanging dollars to bitcoin at $13K. Some of these things are scams.

Because the article is unimportant.  Also they probably got some hate and fixed it. So a link wouldn’t show this, but a screenshot does. Hope that helps :)
