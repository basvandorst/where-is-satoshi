A little correction is due: Bitcoin is not a currency. It's thin air, and anyone using it will lose all their investment, when it falls apart. It's completely useless and there is no practicality behind it. Nerds created a new DnD just with money. Make believe for idiots.

Same issue, South-East Asia, expat, impossible to buy. I have spent entire week to register and get verified, I gave up.
Worst: there is no way to close your account yourself. None of the exchanges allows you to close account, you need to send them an email over their web-client, and you need to trust, that their customer service agents actually deleting your data and not just disabling your access.
Providing your card, proof of address and passport? This is pretty much enough to steal all your money from your actual bank account. Technically they can go and raid your account after a quick password reset with the pictures you provided. Ridiculous.

I live in Bangkok, but I won't try the Cash machine Bitcoin purchase. I gave up, not for me. I would rather open a brokerage or forex account, it seems to be simpler.

Sure, why not invest in something that could wipe out the other 98% in a minute?

Well, it is still a Ponzi until it is government regulated.

Also, you just wasted $600 of your child's money. We should call child protection services for negligence.
