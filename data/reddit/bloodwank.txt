I seriously doubt that they would be down that much. I am certain they would have a large amount of their portfolio trading in the markets. I mean with private keys as old as theirs, it's unlikely they are hodlers.

Not even that, it's just stop losses. Everybody trades BTC pairs, and smart investors (usually with large portfolios) set stop losses. When bitcoin goes up, stop losses are hit sending more and more value into Bitcoin out of the alt market.

Storage is cheap. Storage will scale.
What won't scale is bandwidth. A large portion of hash power resides in China, infamous for their poor latency (great firewall to thank). When you need to start propogatinf 1GB or more blocks every 10 minutes then the consensus architecture will fail. Miners will be building new blocks on a dated blockchain, transactions will be returned to the mempool and orphan blockchains will run rampant. 
Increasing block size will not scale, and a lot of money will be lost if the protocol breaks.

I like to think of Bitcoin as CSNET, and were still waiting for our IP.

Care to clarify?

Whenever somebody asks me how much BTC I have, I ask them how much $ they have. Most of the time they get awkward and start mumbling.

In 2040 when all Bitcoins are in circulation, there will be no more mining block reward. Mining bitcoin for a profit will require either greatly increasing the transaction fee, or else miners will leave. If both happen, we will be left with an ecosystem of bitcoins near impossible to transfer between wallets, and it will become more centralised than ever. 
Im in Bitcoin to make money, but im supporting IOTA for the future.

Unrelated to crytpo, but I highly recommend checking out Monzo! Completely all-based Bank, and it's fantastic. Now my primary Bank until living entirely in Crypto is feasible.

If Coinbase is hacked, my crypto would have half in value before I even read the news

Blockchain technology is here to stay, and many companies are utilising the concept running on private chains/token pairs. Whether cryptocurrency replaces our traditional fiat currency is another discussion.

"On 22 May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz made the first real-world transaction by buying two pizzas in Jacksonville, Florida for 10,000 BTC. In five days, the price grew 1000%, rising from$0.008 to $0.08 for 1 bitcoin."

Awesome work dude. Are the rest of the Staff passionate about BTC? Is payroll 100% USD, and if so is the volatility a problem?

What are you talking about? $30 of BTC will still (likely/hopefully) appreciate with time. I don't think OP will be day trading with it, but to hodl yeah go for it
