Did they really fail though?  Seems to have emerged better stronger richer.

Support last few days was 11,050 its been broke, sub 11k here we go...
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:16:46
I'll let you know in March, but I don't think it will be fun...
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:25:12
then you lose any bounce, let it ride, fuck it, I'm down 30% 
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:30:16
Futures markets closed for the weekend and we're in an uptrend so I'd rest easy and buy now and take profits Sunday, I expect high 12s potentially 13k by Sunday ;)

We are in a clear ascending triangle pattern with almost a double top on last two hourly highs, resistance is 11.87k if we get a bull break out then no resistance till 12.8k...  otherwise I'm sitting cash now.  I'm done Hodl, day trading now and so far good hitting daily targets and keeping my money

thats not that insaine.  I'll never forget get the great wall of GDAX last month at $17.5k, someone unloaded 1,300 BTC at once

I work on wall street and got my bonus today, it sucked and it wont be going into Cryptos, will be going into S&amp;P index especially after Trump's new corporate tax rate...  So don't count on this.

My first Reddit Post, USA about to wake up soon, do they destroy the Market again like last night by continuing to selloff or do they buy at these levels?!?!?  Lets see
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:33:39
Don't listen to this guy, right now it's cheap, 50% discount. If it goes to $7k double down and $ cost average
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:54:42
True, but that's why I set targets, and only take a trade if there is one, so what I said above is where I'll put my money where my mouth is, fingers crossed, if I'm wrong then i buy the short term dip and ride the bounce then repeat
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:27:14
looks like I was spot on in my assessment there ;)  Follow me on twitter 
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:20:32
you shouldn't be trading if you need to ask this, or better yet just stick around and give your BTC to Wall Street guys.  You can set limit orders, do yourself a favor and spend an hour on investopedia or watch a youtube tutorial before trading blindly
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:52:53
I was correct, My double top call saved me from loosing $350 per coin now, I will buy this bounce when it appears ;) take a quick percentage.  follow my on 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:59:03
nope, fuck it.  I lost 80% in 2013 and just forgot about it for all these years, looks like I will do it again
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:15:36
meh, I'm new money so it fits
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:31:12
I'm not the pessimist but the realist, if the 10k support falls, then $7k is def in reach...  That said I'm all in right whats left of my profits, first time to post but long time lurker I've held BTC since 2013 and lost a bunch of money then forgot about it until this yar unfortunately I couldn't HoDl and took my 100% profit after recouping those 2 year loses around April...  Since then I still have skin in th gam, all pure profits I play with, I also sold 1BTC before CME go live at 19k and bought a Rolex, lucky me.  Anyway I'm not cashing out anymore, this money needs to grow or die with this market!

Consider this, everyone who was going to hear about Bitcoin and invest has already done so, CNBC has been speaking about it every 10 minutes for 2 months, all those people got burnt they are not coming back
