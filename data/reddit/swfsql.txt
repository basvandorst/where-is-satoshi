But I just made my point, that this is valuable; that is urgent that government fiats get crashed. In my opinion, after that, Bitcoin will have done it's main purpose.
If you live in a free banking system society, there's no need for bitcoin. It's cheaper and more practical to use fiat (or a certificate) backed by gold (or bitcoins or whatever).
Sure, this state of affairs might never be reached and so cryptos will be permanently needed.

Well, I don't see any problem with that - the greedy long investor part. But there is a positive externality with this: relatively forcing gov. fiats to circulate around in larger quantities, facilitating a crack-up boom on those fiats.


Well, it's not just inactive, but forcefully inactive. It's different since during the locked time one always has the option of moving it, whereas the other doesn't.
In my opinion Bitcoin is a store of value, if you assume that 80% of it's price is volatile. Still, the other 20% is quite awesome store of value. And there's nothing wrong with this division of 80/20%.. it's just a *costly* store of value.


Well in my opinion it doesn't matter if people spend it or not. Right now the world kind of urgently needs to get rid of government fiats, so marginal traders are enough to efficiently give people access to bitcoin, even if they are also buying in with no selling date in mind.
