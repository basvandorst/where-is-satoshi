A transaction includes the address from which the bitcoins are transferred.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to know how much money an address has from looking at the blockchain (record of every bitcoin transaction ever)

Kinda sucks that you have to wait &gt;24hrs for an email transfer to clear, but whatever, that's better than having to submit utility bills lol

Well, too bad. Recommend a better image host then.

Could you please explain what volume means in this context? I have no investing experience and I'm just watching this bubble from the sidelines.

Are you trained in "Cyber-warfare" and have over 300 confirmed proxies?
give me a break..

Look, Imgur doesn't work for images above 2mb (e.g. the gif in the OP) . You need a pro account for that. Minus lets you upload up to 5mb for free.

Yeah, which are in base 58!

It's not about "the network". It's about individual users having a hard time or even being unable to download the blockchain. It's not a problem if you use the Electrum client or something similar, but for regular bitcoin-qt, it makes adoption of the currency more difficult.

I don't think so.
the man meant like everyone should strive for the perfection of math and the use of hard logic to solve conflicts, not fucking hash random numbers until you get something that is a product of capitalism and arguably a factor in a lot of human conflicts

Loads fine on Android ICS. This won't fit on imgur anyway, as it's above 2mb.

mBTC, Satoshis, etc

No need. Reddit has wiki functionality.
for example

(it bloats the blockchain)
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:27:55
Shut up man, the redstones cant do that

Holy shit that's awesome!! Thank you so much for the link. This should really be in the sidebar I think.

Doesn't seem to be limited to linux though.

Even better, Base58.
