The point of changetip is that you keep such small amounts that, if it goes down or gets stolen, it's no big deal. It works well as long as you keep it like that. The issues only arise if you start keeping large quantities in these bots' hands.

If this happens, and the 5% are overloaded, what they would do would be to raise their required fee, while staying below the 95%'s fee. This would maintain their overload, but reduce it substantially. It's called competition: demand is high, you increase prices. The fact that the fee is higher would, in turn, signal to potential investors that there is money to be made, increasing the supply of miners willing to compete with the 95%, and so on until the fee is close to equilibrium.
The market will take care of the long-term price equilibrium. What it won't take care of is short-term frictions: e.g. one-off 51% attacks, one-off manipulation of data, etc.

Maybe all they're doing is setting up a store A in country A where they receive fiat from A, and then allow the other person in store B in country B withdraw it in fiat from B. Behind the scenes, store A transfers from A-&gt;BTC, and then store B from BTC-&gt;B. This way the consumer doesn't have the hassle of converting to and from BTC.
This is what I'm guessing at least, OP doesn't provide many details...

Haha fair point!
@_date: 2011-12-29 17:55:35
Yeah, those seem pretty good. You must have a good setup to have them that low even when overclocked, I have a single 5770 and when I mined temps where around 100ºC in the summer (which is dangerously high) :/ If they stay that low forever, then yeah, feel free to keep it at that BTW I think there's a way of making afterburner go even lower on the memory speed, I think you needed to change some variable on some text file... google will find it for you. :)
@_date: 2011-12-28 20:10:57


Yes you do. I don't overclock "normally" either, and I barely did when mining because I wasn't running mining-only rigs. But, trust me, you DO want to lower memory speed. You see, sustained 100% loads and massive amounts of heat, both of which mining generates, are quite taxing and can cause your equipment to fail sooner. That's why you want to keep temperatures in a safe range. The lower you can go, the better. Lowering your memory speed is harmless but lowers the heat created quite a bit. Not doing so just puts your card in even more danger.
@_date: 2011-05-22 13:48:57


What?! I don't think you understand how currency works.
@_date: 2011-05-16 22:41:57
It is to be a closed market. When 21 million bitcoins are in circulation, mining effectively ends.
@_date: 2011-05-16 17:11:18
So that means that the more computational power you have (by having a more powerful/overclocked machine) the likelier you are to generate a bitcoin?
I'm just wondering because it doesn't seem too fair - anyone with a could of racks of servers would get all the bitcoins, plus the increased CPU power usage when you would otherwise be idling would just increase your power bill more than the value of the bitcoins you'd generate, it seems :/
Also, can you explain why, sometimes, the speed of hashing displayed at the bottom varies so wildly - for example, just half an hour ago it displayed over 5000 khash/s, and then dropped to 177 khash/s, and now it's at 6 khash/s, even though my CPU is averaging less than 20% usage.
@_date: 2011-05-22 20:08:07
Thanks. Perhaps, in addition to what asherp suggested, a link to the "getting started" guide at the bitcoin.it wiki would be a nice addition too.
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:59:50
I'm using my computer that I already had - I haven't bought any dedicated hardware, so all I have right now is a 5770. I get about 177 mhash/s, with the GPU at about 81ºC (it goes up a little on warmer days). I've underclocked the memory as much as possible, though, and I've got my case open.
@_date: 2011-05-17 18:06:58
Of course it isn't. AT the slightest hint of depreciation, the price is going to come tumbling down as everyone tries to sell and nobody buys, rendering all BTCs practically worthless since nobody actually *wants* them.
@_date: 2011-06-12 14:21:57

Mtgox is an exchange. If you want to convert btc to other currency (e.g. USD, EUR, etc) or vice-versa (you want to buy BTC using USD or EUR), then mtgox is one you can use. However you should still have your own client even if you intend to sell everything - you'll want to keep them some times. Install the client and generate an address for deepbit. Then enter that one on deepbit and soon your client will show you have received the coins. Then you can send them wherever (e.g. mtgox, or to buy other things with) - or simply store them of course.
@_date: 2011-06-11 14:48:41
More than one, IIRC.

DO you mean dummy plugs? If you have more than 1 graphics card plugged in, the second/third/etc will not work unless they are plugged into a monitor. A dummy plug tricks the card into thinking it's plugged into a monitor, and thus gets it to work without you actually needing to plug 3 or 4 monitors per rig.

I'd imagine it *would* be extremely hard. Steam/Valve is a big company, and Gabe isn't the God of it all. Plus, sure, he's a pretty cool guy, but I'm sure it'd raise all sorts of legal issues which wouldn't be worth it for so few people (in the scale of things) paying with bitcoins (how many wouldn't just trade it for USD or EUR and pay with that?). Plus, whatever authority Gabe has with Steam/Valve has the goal of making money, and if this isn't a profitable operation, he'd be fucking up... I'm sure he's not an idiot. He might be nice, but he's not a charity.
Might still be worth contacting them, though.

No, you could *hack* into a bank and attempt to steal funds. You'd get caught,a nd even if you didn't, odds are all the transactions would be reversed and it'd be a pain in the ass to find a way to actually get your hands on said funds and launder them. It's not just "cracking"; like in bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-12-28 20:12:43


There are many options. You can either do it through an exchange, such as mtgox, or through another method. Exchanges are exactly what their name says; you give them BTC and they give you another currency (e.g. USD) or vice-versa. Other options are stuff like buying gift cards or pre-paid credit cards and such. I recommend that you start with the wiki/faq for finding these exchanges/merchants.

Anyone, really. Once he released the paper, used TOR/anonymous e-mail, he was fairly safe. And it took a while for bitcoin to gain exposure, so it's not like he was being targeted for identification or anything.
The hardest part of it, really, would be keeping your mouth shut about your identity. And "I mined a shitload of coins because I first created it" is a *VERY* large incentive to stfu about your identity.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:06:49
Lol, sure, but the point remains - it needs to be taken care of. Just because you choose to ignore it and hope for the best doesn't mean the issue doesn't exist.

What? How is going to the shop and buying a soda not a valid exchange of goods and services rendered and taxed?
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:55:59


They didn't, because steps were taken to address those issue, and successfully at that. Quintin3265 has an extremely valid point. He's not saying that bitcoins will necessarily grow too fast for the technical infrastructure to keep up; he's saying that we're approaching a point where these issues are becoming a serious threat, and he holds (correctly, IMO) that if those issues aren't solved, bitcoin will crash because.
What needs to be done is generate a consensus about how to properly solve the transaction limit. If that's done, it shouldn't be an issue. If it isn't, I've no doubt it'll significantly cripple bitcoin.

Dropquests? I've never heard of those but just googled and they seem like one-off competitions? I've got like 8GB, did the available "share on twitter" and such things for a couple hundred MB and referred some friends - telling them you're a student doubles what you get per referral - but still, I could *really* use more! It's hard to convince more friends to sign up when they all already use it though :p

A has a wallet with money that is rightfully his. B steals A's wallet.
If B is caught at this point, I think we can all agree that the money should be returned to A.
However, before being caught, B walks into a grocery store and spends the stolen money on a soda, which he drinks on the spot.
After that, B is caught.
Is it legitimate to go to the grocery store, demand the money back and return it to A? I don't think so.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:59:47


Definitely. Along with this, I'd also include the "omg $x00!!" posts and the "omg $x00 crash sell sell" posts. We can all go check the price if we'd like. Unless it's justified (e.g. you think this price point is special for a specific reason, or you are providing useful analysis) - we don't need it.


Very much so. And especially in passing the message that bitcoin ISN'T a get-rich-quick scheme, and that this isn't a buy-now-sell-next-week-and-make-money scheme. Most of us truly serious about bitcoin have been "In the game" for a significant amount of time; the ideas behind bitcoin - the decentralization, for example - go FAR beyond "making some quick $$$".
Also, another message I think we need to transmit is that bitcoin isn't supposed to "become a currency" - whatever that means - overnight. We're not suggesting you all start receiving 100% of your wages in BTC. It's a step-by-step progress, but we believe the currency's strong points, such as decentralization and low fees, make it worth it.


I entirely agree. The TRULY useful and insightful analysis and communication ends up buried between myriad of useless posts.
However, I do need to disagree about your suicide hotline post. Although we both can agree putting your life savings entirely into bitcoin is a foolish risk, and advise people not to do it without care, the matter of the fact is that we have observed a worrying number of people doing so. And as such, even if they shouldn't have been doing it, we know there is a risk of suicide when an event that can be catastrophic for foolish investors, like this "crash", occurs - so it IS useful, just in case, to have that info available.

Don't get me wrong, from a technical standpoint I'm not independently capable of solving the issue either. But I am aware of it, and what its repercussions might be. If you have money invested in bitcoins, "we're in good hands" isn't necessarily enough.


No, just the acceptance that: a) this issue exists; b) we ought to be aware of it and, however we can, contribute to solving it in a manner that doesn't disrupt bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:58:09


This is true. I think the strategy should be finding niches where bitcoin is much better than traditional currencies. Silk Road (i.e., illegal purchases) was one of these areas in which bitcoin was much stronger. Another area, I believe, is getting money across international borders - if you have $100k in the US and want to bring them to the EU, for example, it's a massive pain in the ass. Yet another area, I believe, is online microtransactions.

They also agreed to ship that hardware on certain dates. Not to hope and dream they could get it out on those dates.
