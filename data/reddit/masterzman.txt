Either take the advice posted or delete your listing. Idk whether you are going to be to duper or dupee in this situation, but its not going to end well for one end of the parties. 
I love these threads that popup with the poster completely unwilling, or has an excuse, for every piece of advice they are given to accomplish what they need done. It always ends with "Will someone on reddit just do me a favor and buy me bitcoin and let me pay you" .... it doesnt matter if its 10 bitcoin or 0.003 bitcoin. Its a scam.

I sell electronic and video games. The consoles, ipads, and phones are   a huge fraud market and the schemes just never end. I have the entire site setup to only take cards that match the billing address, and I only ship to the customer billing address from the card. I even have "advanced fraud detecting features" enabled from the processor and i STILL get bullshit charge backs. This one from this morning seems to have shipped to the customers billing address with what looks like the scammer trying to intercept the package before delivery.

Im surprised any of it was stored at the exchange to begin with. You would think when they sold coin it would be automatically sent then sold on the exchange, without any type of balance lingering around. Plus, if you had a positive balance somewhere, why on an exchange? Wish I could ask the owner what happened

Just got a chargeback on my website this morning from a customer making a purchase with a credit card. I'll be implementing a large bitcoin discount on my site later today over this non-sense.

The ATM usually makes you sign in for larger purchases by sending a one time text message code to your phone that you confirm on screen. Then it monitors your cash you're inserting and makes you confirm a drivers license if you try to put in more than the anonymous limit. Obviously the more ATMs in the area the more money that can move around, but thats no different driving to 20 different stores and buying $1000 of gift cards at each store to avoid a CTR or SAR filing. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:32:35
Also, if you would like someone to take a look at the transaction, feel free to post the transaction hash.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:02:25
Yes that would be $100,000 you didnt have before which is extra income you have made. However, if you have had it for over a year that would technically be capital gains which is taxed at a lower rate than your normal tax bracket. 
I'd recommend speaking with a tax professional regardless.

Transaction will eventually expire and be dumped out of the mempool. If not, it will eventually be confirmed if a miner includes it in a block for you. Some miners will actually proactively clear backlogged transactions (Slush) to help clean up the mempool. So, no its not lost, but you may have to be super patient for like another week.

Depends how much you're putting in. Depends on the operator and how they interpret their business. Most consider themselves conducting a sale of property and not an exchange of currency. Usually anything around 1-3k they will consider a large cash transaction in which FinCEN regulations that they are required to opt-in to require them to record the transaction and who made it for 5-7 years. This information just needs to be stored locally with the company. Its not reported. However, any transactions over 10k in a 24 hour period are required to be reported to FinCEN. Either a CTR or a SAR will be filed. This goes across many industries including purchasing large dollar amounts of gift cards. Purchase 11k in home depot gift cards from your local walgreens and they send in a CTR or a SAR to follow Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws

Federal government does not recognize bitcoin as currency. For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. At what sum total of cash do you need to claim taxes on bitcoin? All of it. The IRS states that even small income such as babysitting should be reported on your taxes. It’s safe to assuming every single dollar you profit on bitcoin is taxable.
It’s important to understand that you are only required to pay taxes on bitcoin when you turn it into cash. This obviously applies when selling your bitcoin at an online exchange or an ATM because you are receiving cash for your bitcoin. However, transactions made for purchasing goods or services is technically realizing a cash value for your bitcoin at the time you spend it. This means you’re required to pay taxes on the cash value of your purchase. This type of transaction is treated as normal income, not capital gains. So if you spend $100 worth of bitcoin to purchase something, you need to claim $100 of additional income on your taxes.
All bitcoin you purchase and hold for less than 1 years time and sold for profit is considered “short term gains” and is taxed as normal income. You will pay your full tax rate for a bitcoin investment under one year. This percentage depends on your normal tax bracket which is based on your income.
Bitcoin purchased and held for longer than 1 year is subject to capital gains tax instead of normal income tax rates. This means that you will be taxed 15% on the total profit from the selling of your bitcoin. If you buy $1000 worth of bitcoin and sell it for $2500, you have a $1500 capital gain which you will pay ~$225 in taxes on.
Be sure to keep your receipts for all your bitcoin transactions and purchases. If you are not sure what price you purchased your bitcoin at, you can always calculate the daily average price for bitcoin on that particular day. Be sure to reach out to a tax professional when possible.

There are some quick scams that can be avoided by educating consumers and putting proper warnings in place. Education is key, but its hard to do with people frantically trying to make an 'emergency bitcoin purchase' or with a deal too good to be true on the line.  
Scammers also adapt (and quickly) to any method put in place to foil their plans. Some scammers that claim to be the IRS or police will tell the victim that THEY put the warning on the machine and its safe to ignore.
The most frustrating scenario (usually involving seniors) is when they are absolutely certain they need to send money to their husband or wife overseas. 
I told an 80 year old man that he was not allowed to use my BATM because I suspected his "wife" overseas was scamming him. He took none of my advice and refused to accept anything I said as truth. By the end of our phone call he was on his way to WesternUnion.
Anyone that wants to see the scammer's side of this should view this YouTube video by ABC News Australia: [  
Currently, I have a scam warning taped to my BATM with a red stop sign. Also, my terms of condition page is used as another warning, since most victims just blow through the purchasing process as quick as possible without taking a moment to breath. If your using GeneralBytes BATMs add  `!7! Your Message`  (7 being seconds) to the beginning of your terms of service to create a countdown the customer must wait through. This will at least slow some people down and maybe they will actually read your on screen warning. 
At the end of the day, police are already aware of these scams. Its nothing new. Bitcoin is just another delivery method, just like iTunes gift cards. I guess the best advice I can give you is to just educated the police on bitcoin, how its a delivery method and why its no different.

You are not taking into account the blockchain growth at 8mb. Currently with full 1 mb block the growth will be ~52GB per year. 8MB would be 416GB per year. At that rate the blockchain will be multiple TB in just a few years.
As Slush wrote on his twitter: [Blockchain size] *2 for indexes. *2 for RAID. *2 for on-machine snapshots. *2 for HA failover. *2 for backup and staging environment.
Suddenly 8MB blocks start to restrict users and developers of lower less wealthy classes from starting projects. Cloud services with multiple TB of disk space is expensive. People that help run full nodes in their homes unable to upgrade size and CPU requirements. Less nodes = more centralization.

Your wallet might allow you to rebroadcast the transaction with a higher fee. If not, just be patient. If you see the transaction pending on a block explorer like blockchain.info then your transaction is in the mempool and you just need to wait it out.

You are taxed whenever your gains are realized for cash value. Its a grey area trading between currencies, especially if you are not trading in cash value terms. However, whenever you cash out that coin is when you should pay tax.

If you didnt save your seed words then you have a big problem on your hands. You need to make sure you have your backup words. 
Better yet, you should always test your backup. When you setup the hardware wallet you should send like 1-2 dollars of bitcoin to the wallet then factory reset it. Type in all your backup words and verify your 1-2 dollars is in there when the recovery process is complete. 
Users storing large sums of value often repeat this process a few times just to be 110% certain.

This is by far the best idea I've seen for making bitcoin more readily available for average consumers.

LibertyX handles this. Thats why this system is great. I'm basically handing the customer a receipt with a pincode to redeem, basically a giftcard to LibertyX.

Method of payment would really be up to the merchant. Cash is secure with no disputes. Credit card would require a markup by the merchant, who then carries increased risk. Its doable, just not logical.

This is all handled by a 3rd party provider by which my store already handles money for prepaid cellphone minutes and directtv dish network bill pay. Long explanation short... I already have large ACH transfers on a daily basis. No red flags here as I have daily and monthly expenditure reports that show the amount spend minus my difference as a merchant. Obviously I claim and pay my fair share of taxes on the difference :-p

Anyone given thought to left over bitcoin and lost keys? My brother bought some stuff off the internet using bitcoin I gave him, but left 0.0006 btc in the wallet. He later 'lost' his private key because he is lazy and doesn't care about 'change'. 
Question is, if bitcoin catches on, and millions of people lose a private key with a few cents to a few dollars on it like normal people misplace regular cash, how do you all think this will affect the network?
Also, dont forget about the few thousand bitcoin that will never be in circulation from Satashi's wallets.

As a store owner that sells libertyx pins, the service SHOULD be fee free at register. The store is not expending any cost (other than the value) to print a pin. 
However, it is up to the store owner if they charge you a fee to use this service. Some employees may not have a choice with the fee as the owner may tell them theres a X amount charged per 'bill pay' transaction.

It's possible to operate under an umbrella company that acts as the MSB. The owner could be acting as the MSB's agent. It's easier to aquire a bank account this way. The government is concerned about money laundering. Someone, somewhere, has to file the paperwork and keep records.

It will be rolled out very soon, however the individual ATM operators will need to be onboarded with LibertyX and update their ATM software on the physical machine. It all depends on how large of a network these operators own. Regardless you should expect LibertyX will be making onboarding a top priority over the next few months. This type of deal has been their goal for 5+ years.

Yes I agree with your point, however, you also have a highly sensitive financial function programmed into the same browser app that's designed for slinging birds into pigs. My point being a vulnerability in chrome *could*  be out of reach for Ledger to fix. Where as depending on how often the issue updates, a native app *could* be more secure. 
But I guess the same could be said for a native app. So maybe I'm just seeing chrome as a glass half empty and a native app as a glass half full.

You should never store keys on cloud storage. Key backups should be in 12-24 word format, written down on paper using a pen. You should then store that physical backup in a very safe spot. 
Storing backups on a cloud make your bitcoin no more secure than a single email and password used to sign into the cloud backup account. Its VERY insecure. 
Here's some further reading on storing keys and backups: [

The private key is stored on the hardware wallet and is never exposed to the computer. The signing process that uses the private key is also done on the hardware. The signature is then sent to the hardware compatible bitcoin wallet on your computer.

like  says, the hardware wallet gives you backup words to recover your wallet should the device be lost or destroyed. Now, you might wonder why even bother using a hardware wallet if you can just backup words on a regular pc or mobile wallet. Well, it loops back around to the security of the key and all the transaction signing being done on that dedicated hardware wallet. You key is never exposed.

No not at all. It works more sell a prepaid phone minutes. You walk into a local store and purchase a 50/100/200/300 dollar libertyx pin number. For this example  we will say $50. The store employee takes your $50 and in return hands you a reciept. On this reciept is a pin number that is redeemable for $50 worth of bitcoin. You simply log on to the libertyx website and redeem the code for the current exchange rate of $50 worth of bitcoin at time of redemption.

If anyone wants to read up on some of the obstacles bitcoin ATM operators face, here's a link: 
Common things that drive up high fees can include
* Bank deposit / account fees
* Bank liquidity requirements (account cash minimum)
* Armored truck pickup and delivery
* ATM manufacturer fees (0%-2%)
* Rental costs at stores sometimes hundreds/m
* BSA/AML/KYC compliance &amp; audit costs
* Legal fees from company's lawyer (very common)
* General business overhead 
Some of these costs can be reduced if more people would run their own ATMs in the local community. However, owning and operating a bitcoin ATM involves a lot of non-sense. Most of it banking related.

No, you do not give a key to the machine to the host location. That's just a massive liability. Also, the more complaints to the store the more likely the machine will be removed or relocated. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:03:46
 
Looks like I'm late to the party. Glad to see an ATM related post with a bunch of comments.
I currently own and operate my own bitcoin ATM. Nothing massive, just one single machine. I've also been writing blogs and guides related to starting up a bitcoin ATM business. Hopefully I can help you out somehow. If you want to get in touch you can reach out to me on twitter 
So here's whats up. You should take care of all the legal and banking matters BEFORE purchasing the ATM. Actually buying the machine should be one of the last things you do. Whether or not you need a lawyer depends on how comfortable you are handling your own legal issues. I've manage to decipher most legal matters on my own, but I do have a lawyer I speak with from time to time.
First you need to understand the current anti-money laundering laws some comments here have already mentioned. Since you will be federally regulated by FinCEN, you will be branded a "money service business". This is basically a death sentence when it comes to being able to open a bank account. Obviously you need one of those to transfer money to an exchange. For all this, you should read my blog here:[ 
After you have educated yourself, and legally formed a business such as an LLC, you will need to hunt down a banking partner that will work with an MSB. This will likely take months. This is also the stage where most businesses fail. You will need to be able to reduce the appearance of legal risks in order to appease a bank to work with you. You can find out more about reducing your "risk" here on this blog"[ 
Last but not least, here is my "complete" guide to starting your own bitcoin ATM business. I use the word complete loosely because it's currently a draft document and nowhere near complete. However, it still contains useful information and you should definitely read it.[ 
Also, to answer your question related to cash, $5000 will not be enough to satisfy the "money cycle" required to operate the ATM business. Rounding up, after your $4000 purchase of a machine you will only have $1000 left. This would mean you would have to limit customer purchases to probably under $100 a day for your money cycle to be efficient. That would also assume you empty the machine daily. Remember, you have 4 balances to maintain: ATM USD balance, ATM bitcoin (BTC) balance, bank USD balance, and exchange USD balance.
Hope this helps not only you, but anyone else interested in starting a bitcoin ATM. I highly encourage it.

I posted this question to his twitter, but I will repost it here for reddit also. 
Did you fail to register as a MSB with Fincen? Does your company have a BSA/AML policy? Do you have a CPA firm independently audit your company's financial transactions annually? Did you fail to record buyer/seller information as required by BSA/AML regulations?

For those who dont know:
Structuring is when you split up your bank deposits, or 'structure' your cash in a way that appears to avoid totaling over $10,000. At ~$10,000 MSBs (Money Service Businesses)  &amp; Banks are required to submit a form to the goverment stating that a large cash transaction took place. Furthermore, is considered "suspicious activity" to "structure" the cash deposits into lets say day one deposit of $7500 and day two deposit of $2500, in order to avoid having a form submitted. 
Trivial detail: It's illegal for a business to tell you if they filed a form to government for said transactions above.

I'm a store owner using the Qpay system. Qpay pays a small flat fee to the store operator for printing the pin. Qpay then takes a small fee for itself. Easy to picture LibertyX paying $2/pin printed.

This morning, we worked to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and have confirmed that you will receive your full deposit tomorrow morning, in addition to any payments taken today. (Due to constraints within the ACH bank transfer system, we are unable to send the deposit today.)
We’re working with our bank partners to ensure this won’t happen again.

Same problem here, my VPS had to be upgraded because the memory demand was way to high. However, I was only seeming to have a problem during the actual download of the initial blockchain and also the rescanning of the blockchain. Maybe this will run on 1GB of ram now because of the lack of blockchain?

Not sure why someone would down vote instead of taking the time to respond to this statement. W/e its reddit.
Anyways, when it comes to merchant acceptance in the bitcoin realm, alot of merchant companies such as Bitpay actually 'cash out' your bitcoin at the time of sale at the current exchange rate. If you take a bitcoin payment worth $10, you see $10 cashed out into your bank account for that transaction. This is a very very common option.  
@_date: 2015-09-01 18:55:47

There is no risk of chargeback or fraud. Merchants can ship items without worrying about any sort of action being taken against them. Same as accepting cash.

I heated my storefront last year using 4 antminer s3 and 1 antminer s5.
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:09:22
Correct. Paypal would act as a chargeback solution via escrow, obviously collecting a percentage of the sale in the process. However, what is different with bitcoin vs fiat is that once a paid trust has been established between the parties, they can move on to the direct wallet to wallet transactions, eliminating the escrow. This differs from today because Paypal may be possible way to conduct and transfer funds in the first place. AKA you have not choice to use 'escrow'.

Only if he wants to accept the possibility of never receiving a single payout. Not one. Ever. Plus you would have to run a full node and hope you have a good enough connection that even IF you managed to find a block, it would not be orphaned.

You have also had a reddit account for 2 hours. Here's a common scam people might think your running here:

Act like your now dependent on this gracious reddit user for helping you get bitcoin. 
Sucker them into or offer a large percentage of a way larger purchase of bitcoin, like $1000 or so. 
Issue a chargeback on PayPal or Amazon cancels the gift card for fraud.

Miners miners miners miners. Miners secure the blockchain and its transactions. Basic bitcoin stuff here. With a 1MB block limit, where is the compensation for the miners? Transaction fees on the network needs thousands of transactions per second to add up to something worth value for miners to continue securing the blockchain. If it turns into a priority war where 'banks' as you would call them 'bid' by including large transaction fees, then we have created the same pay to bank system we created bitcoin to get away from.
We need thousands of transactions paying a penny to accumulate fee to replace lost block rewards moving forward. This means larger blocks with bitcoin user adoption. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:43:40

I dont understand why everyone is flying off the handle all the time about coinbase invading privacy. THIS IS LAW. THEY ARE A BUSINESS. The government will step in and shut them down if they do not comply. Without coinbase, it would become increasing more complicated for tons and tons of people to purchase bitcoin. We can all agree on that.
This concept is literally no different than it is in everyday situations. Heres one I run into a lot. I go to my local gas station and ask them to print me a 700 dollar money order. They wont. They just plain refuse. They get caught up in this government money business transfer reporting stuff and will only print me 1 $350 money order a day. So I got to a local post office. The post office will print me up to $1000 money order, and they will print multiples. Lady at the counter told me that if I was to print lets say a few of those $1000 money orders, she would have to report me to whatever the federal money transfer thing is. 
Its just this simple people. The business must comply or they cant be in business. 
You should be mad at the government, not coinbase. Pissed off you  have to give so much information to signup for coinbase? Or shit, even a prepaid reloadable credit card at or local Walmart? Call your congressman, not coinbase. Tell them you want more privacy.
And yes, the whole reason for bitcoin is to escape this bureaucratic non-sense. However, to bridge the gap between these two different worlds, coinbase will have to follow the law.

This reminds me of a story and some reddit content i found a year ago. Apparently some guys on reddit found out that if you type a certain persons name into the memo or order comments section when you're sending money, paypal will flag your account and shut it down. I guess after some research they said it was related to maybe a terrorist watch list that all financial companies in the united states have to blacklist the names on it from using their services. They had a couple other reddit users test it on their paypal accounts with different variations of the name and all of their accounts were banned. But, at the end of the day, this is the type of non-sense bitcoin will free us from.

Yeah you will need to do a couple low transactions to prove your card is not stolen. Just how these systems work. Merchants face large chargeback risks on large 1st time card transactions.
