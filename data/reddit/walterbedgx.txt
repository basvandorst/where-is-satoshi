All these so-called national e-currencies want one thing: total control over your privacy. Every purchase you make will be tracked and recorded. And once cash disappears the state will know everything. 
The only solution is independent crypto like Bitcoin.

Craig Wright has revenged himself on the Bitcoin community!

There are quite a few bubble posts.
More importantly, please don't allow your condition to put you off from posting! There is nothing wrong with you. How many people have any Bitcoin? 1/100 or 1%. You've taken that step. Peace be unto you too.

Always an optimist these banker-politican-criminals!

What worries me about Vinny is that he came across so eloquently in one of the Bitcoin documentaries. He was the personification of the erudite businessman who wants the best for all. What happened?

Ignoring the fact that no-one really knows what China did or did not ban as very few people in the West speak China and, anyhow, the Chinese authorities are renowned for their opacity, authoritarian governments do not like their citizens having an opportunity to transact outside the established channels. 
Middle class and wealthy Chinese are desperate to leave due to the lack of a rule of law. Hence, they use whatever means necessary to send funds outside the jurisdiction of their PRC overlords. Some even buy four letter domain names which they know they can sell once they get to the West. Bitcoin is yet another way to store funds which can be safely accessed if they manage to emigrate.

They don't homes. They are asking you why you are begging to pay taxes they think you don't need to pay. They are suggesting, with some validity, that you are violating the essence of Bitcoin by begging to be taxed.

Let's go back to the white paper: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. Do you know anyone who HODLs cash? What would be the response if you said: "I think you should keep all your money in cash and never spend it?" Would you be taken seriously? 
If Bitcoin is to develop some level of mainstream acceptance (e.g. 1% of the industrialized world using it on a regular basis), then it must be a payment system rather than merely a store of value. People have to use it!
There needs to be an economy in which prices are displayed in BTC. Wouldn't it be wonderful to see prices in BTC first then USD or CAD or GBP. That cannot happen unless people are spending. What mainstream merchant would bother to advertise prices in BTC if 95% of users are HODLers.
To counter the inaccurate negative perception that BTC is exclusively used to buy narcotics, people need to spend BTC on normal items from mainstream or semi-mainstream establishments. This, once again, means that people need to spend!
Cash - money - Bitcoin is for spending. It is not an objet d'art locked away that no-one will ever gaze upon. It is not jewellery stashed in a safe deposit box that never sees daylight. It is not an attractive princess hidden away by her father in some dusty castle. Bitcoin is real, it is usable, it is applicable, it is relevant, it was created for us to deploy in our current reality. Use it!

Diversify obviously if you have the money. Gold, digital gold, silver, palladium, etc. If you have the money. We don't. Swiss billionaires do.

Why would any one in this group choose AmericaCoin or BritishCoin or CanadaCoin rather than Bitcoin or other well-established alt-coins?
Maybe the sheeple would love a national digital currency but millions if not tens of millions of people want some level of financial independence from the mainstream system.

I would question whether he plans to hold BTC or immediately convert it into fiat as, I believe, Overstock does. 
Imagine if all those who had converted into fiat had kept their earnings as Bitcoin! How much profit would they make!

Question: is Bitcoin money or some kind of asset for trading? If it's money then its relation to fiat is irrelevant. I don't say: what's one euro in yen. I just spend euros. If the goal is a Bitcoin economy then people have to spend.
