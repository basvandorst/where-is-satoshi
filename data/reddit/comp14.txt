Bitcoin is an open financial network, and the race is always on between those who are trying to identify bitcoin transactions and those who are building privacy enhancement tool for bitcoin.

I am also interested to know this.

Deciding the fixed supply (21 million) is an integral of the bitcoin protocol, and the mainstream believe is that Satoshi wanted the supply to be 21m. 


I thought the 21m number was Satoshi's idea, and since bitcoin was his brainchild, I accepted it. I don't know when and where the bitcoin community decided to make the supply 21m. This is the first time I hear about it.

worst interview I have ever seen.

You are right on that part.
I agree many things with Satoshi, and when I say "I accepted it," I meant the 21m fixed supply is OK. There is no difference between 21m and any other arbitrary number as long as bitcoin is divisible down to many decimal places. But my point is: Why do people say that Satoshi wanted the supply to be 21m? I really don't see any reason to hide such information from the community.
I know there's a lot misinformation out there in the internet, but I thought the bitcoin supply was not one of them.

The question is: Did Satoshi make this hard coded change? It's important to know if someone else did that change.

Let's be clear. I am not concerned about the number (21m) itself, but I am asking why do people say Satoshi made the supply 21m? It's clear he didn't.

This is the one of earliest discussions about the supply of bitcoin that I could find.

As a customer, I have full control of whether I should accept the exchange rate offered by coinbase. Overstock don't care the exchange rate, they only set their price in USD.

No, I mean I have few of them in other systems like hot wallets, but most of my btc are in cold storage brainwallet systems. 


Isn't warpwallet a form of brainwallet?

The size of your tx is 1515 bytes, and the fee you paid is 10,000 satoshis. So that is about 6.6 sat/B.
The current fee density is about 45 sat/B as you can see it here [

This is pure FUD. They are presenting the brainwallet issue as if it is one-size-fits-all topic.
Sure, some bitcoin users can't create secure brainwallet, but there are other users who can come up with a strong brainwallet system.
I use brainwallet as a cold storage system, and most of my bitcoins are in there.

It is a real private key,(WIF compressed). But OP, How did you find it?

So you want to increase the block size limit because you prefer the blocks not to get full; then the question is: What would you do when the block size approaches to your preferred limit? Increase it again? Up to where? Infinity? Your logic is flawed.
Anyway, as a bitcoin investor, I only support hard forks that address emergence issues. Everything else should be dealt with a soft fork.
