Why would you not just call coinbase? The coins couldn't possibly be in your account yet..takes like 8 days for ach.
Call their support number and they'll straighten it out.

Are lightning fees payed to nodes?

I use cointracking.
According to them, the APIs from exchanges suck and data is "incomplete".
Leads to unintuitive negative balances, which they say are "normal".

Jeff: We always ask users that need specific information to email us. While email headers/names can be easily spoofed, as long as the sender maintains strong account security then email is much more secure

Yeah,  USA only.

I love Coinbase.. but this is a big issue around internet best practices. Last thing I want is for Coinbase users to get robbed because someone is sniffing email traffic, which *may* be unencrypted in transit.

Assumption would be someone trusted by Coinbase.com.

They are using SSL and 3rd party chat solution for live chat.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:27:32
Well, that 3rd party group said they had access to my account details.
As for PGP-- yeah-- but why not just host a ticket system for support?

However, I did get same day withdrawal a few times last week.

Wife was like this.
Now she says "keep doing what you're doing."

USB Keys degrade when unpowered.
Use DVDs, Paper. etc.

That's a chat invite to discord

Just call support... the fixed for me that day.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:12:55
I think that's similar to what IOTA does with tangle.

Mining with nicehash would be good for you. No power costs and price rise means you'll eventually be profitable after hardware is paid off.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:16:22


Not seeing it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:41:12
Coinbase works, has real support, and are stable.
Until another US based company actually can compete, it's the best out there for frictionless purchasing.

I think there are two issues:
1) banks telling us how to spend our money
2) banks treating Bitcoin as a good/service versus a currency.
 is wrong. 
 adds legitimacy to Bitcoin as a currency. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:07:49
Maybe we shouldn't be upset. I can see it as adding legitimacy to Bitcoin as a currency.
Getting Euros from a credit card is a cash advance, shouldn't Bitcoin be too?
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:09:42
Shouldn't that be a function of your credit limit and the amount of risk a bank is willing to take with a specific borrower?
Adults should use good judgement, and be penalized for when they don't.
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:51:17
Cash advances.
@_date: 2015-03-14 00:14:25
1. no.  
2. I like the fact that you are doing this.  
3. I could have used you guys earlier.
