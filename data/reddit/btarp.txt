I also made a quick demo of the chat room I made for testing

Yeah, it has issues with large amounts currently. Keep in mind it’s only beta software and the developers recommend less than .16 BTC per channel. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:29:27
For sure. Well if you ever need some tips on setting one up let me know. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 15:44:38
They can cut off access to it at any point.

I appreciate whoever tipped me 1000 sat using this tool!
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:51:15
That’s great as well but I was talking about LN
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:07:29
It is super fast! Really fun to use too. You should try out the roulette and satoshis place. 
If you downloaded blue wallet then it’s in the market place (there is a link under your balance when you are in the LN wallet)
Have some fun !lntip 500

The bot has instructions on how to withdraw. 
You could download a custodial lightning wallet for testing. Blue wallet is a good one for iOS and Android. 
Then you can play roulette with it and mess around. Or just tip others. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:12:40
You’re welcome. Have some fun 
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:22:43
Yeah $300 is steep haha. This is just the start, hopefully we will get a easy node that runs flawlessly on your phone or something. 
As long as your node is public then you can connect. 
Check out  Bunch of nodes and stats for nodes. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:18:44
Blue wallet is custodial and I don’t normally recommend it. They have a node and keep track of the funds you are putting into it and can spend. 
I have two of my own nodes, one at home on a raspberry pi and another on a VPS for testing and app development. 
It’s a pain to set up a node currently unless you know your way around Linux. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 14:09:15
Blue wallet is custodial so you personally aren’t responsible for setting up a node. You also don’t hold the coin yourself which sucks. I recommend setting up your own personal node. 
You cannot withdraw onto your on-chain wallet without use of a third party through blue wallet. 
I think just on-chain and LN wallets. Good question haha 
@_date: 2019-02-13 21:14:57
It makes more sense to mention it in sats currently but it doesn’t really matter. 
I can request you give me 10 satoshi. I’m not going to say give me  0.0000001 BTC. LN can work with these small values and that’s why people use sat

You cannot use the same invoice but this won’t be that big of an issue, they are easy to make and software can do it automatically. 
I think people are even making ways to send payments without invoices at all but I haven’t looked into it much. I made an application that you can install on top of your node and it will generate new invoices through a hyperlink or HTML image tag. Everyone who hits your webpage will get a different invoice without you needing to do anything. 
LN is still a baby and software is going to get better and make it do amazing things.

I was listening to the Stephan Livera podcast where he mentioned that cash app team has a couple lightning nodes. I have never felt so excited about bitcoin as I was right then. It’s amazing that a major “mainstream” company is taking LN into consideration. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:55:48
This is pretty cool man. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 20:54:19
Hmm this is a little outside of my knowledge now unfortunately. 
The second command you ran returned: verification progress 0.99999867 etc. I wonder if it needs to be completely 1.0 in order to be ready for connections. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 04:06:58
Checkout the bot that replied to me. I gave you 10 satoshis.

If you really want a simple first time wallet I’d get a mobile wallet. BRD on iOS is great and looks nice as well. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:03:03
It’s fun. You learn a lot. You get to host your own full node as well. More secure. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:02:12
You can move your coins now into another wallet that you trust temporarily. Then wipe the ledger and restore it using your current seed. If the seed is correct then you will be able to see your transaction history. Then just transfer the coins back over onto the ledger and sleep soundly. 
Never type those seed words into a computer.

It’s a digital currency. Digital signals are 0s and 1s, bits are 0s and 1s. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 04:08:53
I gave some to you, it's a start.
But really if you want bitcoin then download cash app. I think they only need your drivers license

That $3 a year running a raspberry pi
@_date: 2019-01-09 05:59:54
OP is about to setup two things on his credit card sized computer. 
1.	A full bitcoin node that will verify and store the entire bitcoin block chain
2.	A lightning network node that can operate on the LN securely. 
A raspberry pi is fairly cheap to buy and to keep up 24/7 so it’s a great tool for having a self hosted node. 
I just got mine up and running over the weekend and it’s been great so far.

Take a paper wallet from the printer. 
No thanks, don’t trust it.

It's a proof of concept. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 06:44:45
Do the logs help at all?
    sudo journalctl -f -u lnd
This should give some useful information. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:54:53
If you get a raspberry pi then I’d go with this guide. You will learn a lot but it can be pretty complicated. You might have to research a bit. 
If you run into problems then send me a PM and I can get back to you when I’m free. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:16:21
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2019-01-03 20:30:00
As soon as I got a ledger I started sleeping better for sure. I never had a lot of bitcoin but after the run in November 2017 I started seeing more money than I felt comfortable with on a phone wallet for sure. Worth every penny IMO, especially since I got it on Black Friday 
@_date: 2019-01-03 20:25:09
!lntip 50 Congrats everyone 
@_date: 2019-01-04 06:35:13
This one is great. Could be better but it works and I used it to send some coin today.

Ok interesting. Are you waiting for the block chain to be synced all the way? 
    sudo tail -f /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/debug.log  
Run bitcoind and then run that command. Wait until it is fully started and synced before unlocking your wallet. 
You will see 0%....15%. Etc etc and then peers connecting. Then you can unlock your wallet and hopefully it won’t exit with an error.

Let's keep that ball rollin'!
@_date: 2019-01-07 06:35:20
Great guide but it’s definitely difficult getting started into the lightning network. Just finished my node today after spending all day tinkering with it. 
The guide goes step by step but if you aren’t familiar with Linux or terminal commands I’d stay clear for now. LN has a while to go until someone can just download a program and use it securely and easily.
Good luck to anyone setting it up, if I can help with questions let me know and I’ll try.  
@_date: 2019-01-09 14:25:55
They are very low power. Plus it’s fun

I don’t think he is mining.

I’m in the middle of setting this up. Thanks for the link!
