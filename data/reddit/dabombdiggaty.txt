Snowden slides where the government talks about their progress in deanonymizing the tor network by running honeypot nodes throughout the world have been published. Documents indicating that searching for or expressing interest in using TOR or the TAILS browser will make someone a more likely candidate for NSA surveillance. You can google all of this with relative ease.

That title alone... I can't even. I love the internet.

You're spot on and I'm worried this case is going to be seen as "too big to fail" and set up some extremely nasty precedent for overseas surveillance of citizens.

Coin base is a simple platform for buying bitcoin that's been around for ages. He could have been setting his clients up with accounts before circle came out.

There are SUPPOSED to be whistle-blower protections but, well...

This is my biggest problem with this idea, but I have faith that the tor and bitcoin communities both value their privacy enough that a solution to this will be necessary for this toroken to gain any traction. I'll definitely be waiting and watching with baited breath.

Sympathetic upvote because apparently people don't recognize sarcasm when it isn't labeled with a /s

Almost every point you made is regularly poked fun at on this subreddit as sensationalist bullshit criticisms of bitcoin that have 0 basis in the real world so I'm really not sure at this point whether or not you're trolling, or just stupid.
 It's definitely one of the two though.

Can someone please explain this like I'm five? Because I totally understand what is happening... I'm just worried  about the people who don't...

They're arguing that he has no expectation of privacy (provided by the fourth amendment) unless he incriminates himself by saying he owned the server (which he shouldn't have to do pursuant to the fifth amendment). That's about the gyst of it.

It's reddit. Let's set some realistic expectations here.

Luckily, that's exactly what happened in silk roads absence.
Unfortunately, that was also one of the reasons prosecutors cited when asking for the maximum sentence, claiming he invented this entire new system for purchasing drugs and should be made an example of for the other offenders.
If you read the prosecutors letter to the judge it almost sounds like inquisition- level thinking (or lack of thinking)

Is there anything wrong about opposing and tryingtoavoid a tax on your existence?

Have you heard of the NSA?
I like using TOR when I want to be sure there aren't any spooks sniffing through my web traffic. Furthermore, you have dissenters in foreign countries that would not be able to safely voice there opinions without the TOR network.
This gentleman
 would probably be strung up by the cartels for what he posts online, but if he's intelligent that won't happen because he posts on TOR. These are just a couple reasons, but in general if you care about privacy in the least bit, you should get really offended when people claim that the TOR network is only used for illicit means of communication. 
 Asking for justifications for why people should be allowed to use TOR is like asking why people wouldn't want to use state- issued transparent envelopes for their mail when there are opaque white envelopes that actually hide their personal business. People simply don't like others looking through there personal business, our government simply hasn't come to the understanding that this is the case both in the physical and electronic realms.

Is that actually how they're hosting their domain or just a way you're proposing they could host it? Because that's a great idea either way.

Neither does banking when compared to the strengths of bitcoin, hence the issues they have with their customers becoming familiar with/ accustomed to using it.

You just received a ticket that minimizes the responsibilities you have in life. The one thing you could do for yourself is to be responsible in how you handle your magic no- responsibility ticket. Good luck to you.

Yes, that is what this apparent middle schooler is trying to assert. Facts be damned, he's handing out downvotes to anyone who dares question his hackz0ring blockch4in skills on reddit

Isn't it only the woefully uninformed that are making bitcoin a political issue for the most part? I understand that there are clashing ideologies but it still boggles the mind that people can get so up in arms over 1's and 0's that were written for the specific purpose of being apolitical
