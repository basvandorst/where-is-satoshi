Interesting how you deflect the main subject of that message, the audit that Tether themselves admitted wasn't really an audit.

That's the supposed reason it exists. Parking your wealth in something that *you believe* you can be sure won't crash overnight, without the hassle of cashing out into fiat, while whatever price action that made you go into Tether calms down. Nobody holds USDT for the sake of holding it, it's nothing but a tool.

@_date: 2018-01-27 13:55:45
Adoption can continue organically and it IS growing, LN is only in its infancy. Every day people post about setting up full nodes and supporting the network, not even trying to mine. Bitcoin might crash to 3k and slow down all crypto growth, but it's not stopping and neither will the development. 
Regardless if there are altcoins that have solved problems, it's too early to know which ones will stand the test of time. Look at the internet in 2003 vs now.  BTC will stick around for a while at least to shepherd the ones that will take over, or members of the community may try to develop it to keep it competetive. It has right to stay as a gold standard for now though.

I've read through most of the thread, and I remain sceptical. 
My question is - have they been audited yet, and if not, why is that? Wouldn't that solve a lot of problems and calm these discussions? Especially as many imply that Tether's 'relationship' with Bitfinex, as well as potentially other exchanges, is a healthy thing for the market, and that Tether is filling an important role.

Tether stays pegged and Tether Ltd takes the losses. No way an audited company of three main people with business social anxiety would just pack up shop, take the pile of fiat and crypto they can and pull a cheeky smoke bomb act.

Refusing to just pay with fiat is a proactive individual contribution to adoption and an incentive for the vendor to continue accepting crypto. Buying back in with the amount you spent means your portfolio and potential future gains remain untouched. I don't see anything strange here, unless you see crypto as a fad to cash in on and nothing else.

You should transfer your fiat balance directly to GDAX, not your BTC. Ideally, you should also get a segwit-supported wallet to store your coins in, rather than keeping them on exchange, although I will admit I myself am guilty of keeping my coins on GDAX for extended periods of time with no issues.
If you want to actively trade, I would also recommend just hodling until you learn at least some basic technical analysis like support &amp; resistance, trend lines and channels, and using a real exchange (like GDAX) over Coinbase. I highly recommend babypips.com to learn, it's for Forex markets but the majority of the skills are transferable across markets, and tradingview.com to use charts. Please also keep in mind that TA in isolation is nothing more than astrology, especially in a market like cryptocurrencies, but in my (albeit amateur) view it is equally as harmful to your trading to dismiss TA completely.

Coinbase has now implemented SegWit, allowing for smaller transaction fees. However, despite the fact that your coinbase account will display "wallets", and technically they are "wallets", that is not what we generally mean by the term, as in this case, the exchange is in charge of storing the coins and private keys. Even though Coinbase or other exchanges may promise to hold most of its reserves in cold (offline) storage, they cannot guarantee the safety or that they won't one day go poof and disappear with all of your digital wealth. If you do not own and have control over your own private keys, they are not your coins and **nobody** will help you if something happens to the exchange, eg. a big hack or bankruptcy . You should be using at least a wallet like [Electrum]( for smaller amounts or a ideally, a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor for real amounts. How you quantify those amounts is up to you.
You can transfer fiat funds to Coinbase then to GDAX to purchase BTC, or you can deposit BTC to GDAX directly from your personal wallet.
I would highly recommend watching some talks and Q&amp;As by Andreas Antonopoulos to learn about the fundamentals (and philosophy) of bitcoin. You can find him on youtube under his [aantonop]( handle, and some of his material has been reposted on [mixcloud]( if you prefer a podcast format with no video so you can listen on the go.

Wrong, it doesn't just become support as soon as the zone is breached. We've crossed below it now even with strong buy pressure but volume has been down across the last two days, we can see divergence between price increase and volume decrease on the hourly and daily charts. This short term uptrend is about to cross with a longer-term downtrend AND correction channel trendline. This is a 70% drop we're recovering from, it doesn't happen over a weekend.

Where is the evangelising? I'm not planning on holding up the line while I quote Andreas Antonopoulos for 20 minutes. You're talking as if casual exposure to crypto will somehow turn people away from it, but that's exactly what is needed to present it as more than unregulated internet stocks on crack. We NEED instances of "oh but actually somebody tried to pay with bitcoins when I was at the store". I'm not taking a fucking vegan attitude, it's not that hard.

Down channel trendline, 35-day down trendline, and 9k resistance are all right on top of us + low volume. Holding the line above 8250 but until we broke out for a couple of days, we were right at the end of a double bear flag.

From what I remember from babypips:
If your intial order is a buy order, then the stop loss is set below the entry price to quickly close the trade at a loss, exit the market and minimise losses before the price falls too much
If it is a sell order, the stop loss is set above the entry price to quickly re-enter the market and re-open a long trade, meaning you're still able to profit as the price continues to rise

You're still missing my point, your degree of disapproval of moral standards of people or institutions spreading a narrative is a separate matter to their motives for doing so and the effect of it on a number of mostly uninformed people who will nonetheless buy into it by being unaware or indifferent to the moral standards of said people or institutions. This has an impact on part the target market. We never ever said that BTC or crypto is general is only intended for good or politically aware people in the long-term, and your or mine personal disapproval won't make it so because a decentralised protocol does not have the capacity to differentiate between those who are morally good/politically informed and those who are not. It's better to try to acknowledge the source for what it is, then analyse what the aforementioned motive and effect on what part of what demographic rather than calling just call for censorship. Or at least do both. If you're so against the Qatari government, are you not interested in whether they're playing their 'we're different than other media' card to millenials, or there is a political angle that may be being pushed and what is that?
My country's society and institutions are being imploded by the government and their narrative is toxic and plays on dangerous emotions and groups that could eventually become a catalyst for (intentional or not) civil war if things play out the worst way they could, but I still hear their narrative to know what the people that do believe them are being fed.

I think I saw a count of around 20 million wallets, which obviously means less users. This is VERY early adoption. Everybody uses the internet comparison, I like to use the synthesised music and production equipment, which started in the late 50s and early 60s with quirky scientists and professors who got fired for wasting university funds for these useless, refrigerator sized beep-machines, but in the late 60s and 70s started to give us psychedelic rock and dub/Sound System culture among others. Fast forward to 2018, mainstream music is mostly electronic, underground electronic music can have musical ideas arrangements and frequency planes that couldn't have even been imagined before, and anybody can have access to hundreds of physical or imagined instruments and percussion at their disposal, live, while mixing it with "traditional" instrumentalism.

With GDAX, you still have to deal with long bank transfer times, but once your fiat is in your Coinbase fiat wallet you can transfer it to GDAX and trade there for substantially lower fees on market orders and stop losses as well as no fees on limit orders.
If you do not understand the different types of orders, I suggest checking out [the corresponding lessons on babypips]( If you are new to trading I highly recommend going through the entire course, it is for Forex (fiat currency exchange market) but aside from the fact we don't really use pips in crypto, the vast majority of the knowledge is transferable. It is also 100% free.

anybody still anticipating a double bottom?
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:54:33
Good question. From my understanding, for a channel to open or for additional funds to be deposited into a channel, a transaction has to be completed on-chain. All of the funds entering have been broadcast and verified. To get out any funds, another transaction has to be broadcast and verified, while the transaction recorder on-chain will simply state the totals - however if something shady were to be able to happen between the two on-chain transactions, the final totals wouldn't match the funds that were previously deposited, broadcast, and verified, rejecting the entire transaction altogether. This way there in an inherent incentive to just NOT even try to double spend, even if it were possible, since the funds would just stay locked up in the channel. It is a layer 2 solution, not a parallel system, so everything that happens is dictated by the rules of layer 1. But I might have some details wrong, I am still a noob.

Just to clarify, miners don't 'forge' the coins, it may seems that way when you first learn about it but it's actally a reward or payment from the network for participating in the resource-costly process of verifying transaction. So although new coins are created in the process, the term 'forge' is more misleading than correct.
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:38:39
