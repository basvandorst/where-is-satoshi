Just to, you know, reality check a little.  It is entirely possible that they didn't tell you the truth about their intentions.
Nothing personal, but if I was Big Company A and some random from the Internet sent an email asking about a project that we actually were working on, I'd probably not answer honestly.
"Golly, we're working on that right now! It's going to be awesome, we've calculated a ridiculous ROI on this project! Er... You're not one of our competitors are you?"

Cryptsy is not foreign. The owner lives in Florida and runs the site from there.

Also existed before Bitcoin.
Has been said on every exchange floor I've ever worked on. (So, at least 1985, and I'm guessing before)

This thing won't survive more than a couple of months.
They think they are being clever, but the clear intent of Apple's enterprise license is for it to be used by employees of an organization.
I'm guessing with a few keystrokes their lawyers will clarify that intent and then revoke their license.  Why does anyone think that tricking Apple into doing something is helpful in any way?
It's their platform, they are going to do what they want with it.  The rest of us get to decide if we still want to do business with them.
That's how the world (is supposed) to work.

So... Really the headline and content of this post are meaningless speculation?
The large days destroyed could have something to do with Gox or nothing at all.
Must go write sensationalist headline!

You are a little slow on the draw. I'm already validating coins.
This is to let you know that I've concluded that your coins are invalid. Please PM me for instructions on how to remove the taint from your coins.  We charge a very reasonable 5% fee to make sure your coins are valid and usable.
Also, if you need us to wash any illegal drug residue off of any paper fiat you own, we will also do this for no fee anytime you pay for our validation services.
Remember: TheCoinValidation, the only validation service with the word "the" in its name!

So how do you access risk in a decentralized way?
Or just give everyone who asks money?

My opinion is Apple will say, that the intention is for this to be for employees if organizations, not merely members of co-ops.
If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, Apple will shoot it like a duck.
I'm guessing changing the wording on their enterprise developer agreement is trivial, and trying to skirt the rules they've set is probably counterproductive to where we all want Bitcoin to go.
Don't get people's hopes up for something that you know is likely to get shutdown. Not all users are as educated about the nuances of what is going on with Apple and Bitcoin and will instead just count it as a negative experience with Bitcoin when and if the App gets pulled.

It is important to note that if you import private keys from another wallet into your Electrum wallet that the seed will not be able to generate those keys.
Best practice (and really anytime you import private keys) is to sweep it to another address.

"Market value" of a thinly traded security is measure of net worth.
Yeah, Microsoft would be worth less if Bill Gates sold his shares.
MPEX would be worth Zero if Merica did the same.
Smart guy, but his marketing is targeted towards stupid people. If you have any experience in real-world finance, you can see right through the charade.

Seeing as how I actually already have been a RTBTC subscriber, I can with 100% authority and assurance confirm that Bitstamp is the only exchange currently supported.
Please provide the link where I can enter my API credentials for any other exchange or even just view it.

Awesome strawman.
Does Gox authoring an invalid tx tell us anything about the state of their internal financials?
Is finding flaws like this before resuming withdrawals actually things working as intended?
What exactly and precisely can we assign meaning to in the substance of the OP other than things aren't working 100% as they should? (Gee, could that have anything to do with not resuming withdrawals? Do companies test stuff and by necessity need to create errors to find what is left to fix?)
You'd think by the title and tone of this post that this was the final nail for Gox.
I guess "Gox still debugging withdrawal patch." doesn't bring as much attention or sound nearly as interesting, but is probably closer to the truth.
Of course, I know the author of the OP was merely passing on information and has no bias at all.  So I guess I'm speculating about the "meaning" of it all as much as anyone.
Blah blah blah...
BTW, your coins are now invalid. PM me for the best validation rates in town!

Step aside, son. Let some real Validators show you how this works.
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:15:56
Be Aware! THECoinValidation is the only validation that has "The" right in the name.  Don't settle for less, remove the taint of CoinValidation with TheCoinValidation services.

Are there any areas of our current understanding of Bitcoin law that you think may be changed through a court decision in the future?
(For example, the finding that Miners are "money transmitters" could be reversed by a court on some legal grounds that I don't understand...)

I hope no one confuses the real coin validation team with these fakes above.
As you can tell, by the use of the word "The" in my username, that I run the only legitimate coin validation service around here.
