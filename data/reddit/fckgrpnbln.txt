is it possible for random people on the internet to run any critical part of the Ripple or Stellar infrastructure?
if not i don't see why it's being listed next to other cryptocurrencies either..

I oppose the block size increase path, yes. Do you have the impression that I don't?
Blockchains should lower the bar as far as possible for people to participate in their infrastructure, no?

how does Craig Wright still have any voice at any table? the guy clearly pretended to be Satoshi, was exposed as a fraud, and now we still have to put up with seeing his name in connection to anything cryptocurrency related?

has anyone managed to setup a UASF node on AWS?

This still sounds fine for me. Again, I should have said "connectivity" and not "bandwidth" in my original text, as pointed out.
Perhaps you think running UASF nodes on cloud is a bad idea because the point of UASF is to give economic nodes the option to preemptively choose the segwit side of a fork (thus also discouraging the fork to begin with). In that case it wouldn't be helpful for more nodes UASF to exist just for the purpose of increasing UASF node representation in the network?

I understand "block size increases" to mean hard forking the protocol to accept larger blocks, i.e. changing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE. 
By block size increase, do you mean "fit a larger number of useful transactions into a block" and/or "require more space to store and send"?
SegWit does require more space to store and send, right? I'm okay with that though. I'm saying "I won't have the bandwidth" as in "i won't have a stable internet connection through which to connect my node".

would be cool right? we just pool our cash resources and spin up the maximum number of UASF nodes on the cloud somewhere
maybe we could find a cloud provider that accepts bitcoin and pay in a trustless way

okay! well i'd like a guild to doing that then..

I disagree. This fiasco is due to mining centralisation, which is due to SHA256 being susceptible to ASIC.
My understanding is that memory-intensive PoW's are harder to ASIC because memory hardware is already intensively optimised?

i can't seem to find an explanation of this - can you link to something that explains it?

could you set up a UASF node on a cloud server like AWS? i'm looking for a guild to do this
