National currency will always exist. Bitcoin will be an alternative to whom we will all choose. You dont send a letter to another country with a paragraph, you send an email. You can't send a package through email.

How are you basing that those funds will be to fund war? Where the hell did you get that idea from. So your saying cyberpunks will fund wars? Lol I think you have a misconception of power. I would also assume that is what you would do so I wouldn't trust you. So keep on studying

Does bitcoin mining difficulty reach a maximum? Or Is there a limit to the difficulty adjustment?
@_date: 2019-11-11 19:20:53
Thanks so much

Problem is its about out of London. I think they didn't open it strategically
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:28:46
Why wate their time? They could do this for a couple of years. But not for the long run. No chance

Agree. But not yet invest now. I can't see the price going wild. It will with bakkt. But I can't see the price going mental before the 3rd halving at 2020
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:37:17
Google is stoopid. Also thinks bitcoin has a couple of CEO including Warren Buffet, Roger Ver and more

Why can I only connect to 8 nodes? Sorry, bit nooby here, I'm setting up a raspberry pi to run a bitcoin node and I'm just curious as to why it dkesnt connect to more than 8 nodes

Agree, and i think this will be like nothing we have ever seen before. Even this so called bubble. I think its nothing and I don't understand why people can't just hodl. If you belive in bitcoin no FUD will make you sell
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:35:23
Why do i think it won't be yet? IMO I think its to early for a bull run. We need to get rid of weak hands, and all the shit coins that keep bitcoin down. A pinch of regulation so institutional investors can come in the game

@_date: 2019-08-06 17:26:45
Why doesn't bitcoins confirmations go from 1 to 500 in seconds? Doesn't my transaction get confirmed by all other nodes and added to their blockchain? Why does it take time for 1 confirmation then 2 and so on?
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:52:09
Amazing. I had thought that it was 1 miner had mined my transaction and then passed that on to other and so on. It really didn't make much sense as to why. It wasnt very clear to me because it wasnt what I've been tought from all sources. I thought 1 confirmation meant that 1 miner had mined my transaction. And for 2 miners it had to be another miner to mine my transaction
@_date: 2019-10-26 23:40:41
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:47:49
So then the confirmation number 2, only means that it's another block on top of the block where my transaction was placed?
@_date: 2019-10-26 23:41:59
Can I use this as my twitter banner?
@_date: 2019-06-11 13:10:59

Ok yeah, bitcoin moons we all love that. But question. Where the f***k am I supposed to store 1 million dollars. Under my bed?!
EDIT: My point being. Don't tell the world you own bitcoin

Why aren't merchants already using bitcoin?

Where do people buy bitcoin in the UK? Asking for a friend
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:35:01
If you look at coinbase pro and binance Jersey, you tell me. Gbp/btc
@_date: 2019-06-16 20:03:09
Is there a limit to bitcoin's difficulty adjustment? As in, will there be a time that the difficulty doesn't increase because we have reached a maximum?
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:21:55
I now understand you. But earlier this morning I was shocked to see that binance Jersey was trading at +200 pounds than coinbase pro for a good 4 hours. I had to ask before making a move
@_date: 2019-06-11 15:20:16
She's my girlfriend
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:20:56
I think this is the best answer. The thing is I keep throwing cool bitcoin things at her and I cant stop it. She knows well beyond the average person because I keep teaching her this or that. But she is still skeptic, but she listens
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:04:55
There are loads in London. I really love it and get all excited when I see one. 10/10 experience!!
@_date: 2019-02-19 17:45:02
No! ETF is price manipulation. Do you not think the price of gold isn't manipulated from ETF's? Google will be your friend. Do some research
@_date: 2019-02-27 08:57:03
What about long term. When bitcoin moon. Then dat bitch wants to use them coins. Send her off
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:48:30
Public sentiment will not increase with an ETF. Public sentiment is adoption, is easy to use. Go and make a poll to the average person you find on a busy street and ask what have they heard before. ETF or Bitcoin. That is your answer my friend. Get your head out of etf ideas. It's not necessary. Bitcoin needs organic growth just like we have seen yesterday
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:49:22
Got 11/20 got most of the bitcoin correct and failed most of ethereum
@_date: 2019-06-12 12:23:31
In chart?
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:07:19
Ye, and a constant downward trend in price if etf is approved. Venezuela doesn't need an etf approval. Neither does nobody

I'm tired of putting money into bitcoin then bitcoin losing value. F***k!!
@_date: 2019-02-27 17:40:15
@_date: 2019-02-23 16:21:45
Ok so I understand that if bitcoin hits one million.  That means that 1 satoshi in value will be paired with 1 penny. But how are the governments or banks supposed to let this 20 trillion network thrive without having a word to say? Letting that nerd money get moon and lambo.
Its 20 trillion. 20 trillion market.
@_date: 2019-06-17 11:49:18
Buy on one exchange sell on another that has a hier price. Rinse and repeat. Does this actually work? Its seems very simple

Edit the eyes to make look like he's looking at the fat red line
@_date: 2019-02-05 10:20:47
I have a question.
We know that bitcoin transactions on the blockchain is increasing. But don't you think that because of lightning network transactions making 2 transactions in opening and closing a payment channel. I understand you can keep a channel open. But people also do close. Do you think because of the lightning network capacity growth this has affected the blockchain because of 2 transactions?
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:03:22
What if it goes to 0. I can explain why it wouldn't. But then the "oh that's to complicated" comes out. I come to realise it's just the people around me that dont give a shit about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-19 16:00:41
This is wrong
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:43:47
Warren Buffett says bitcoin is a 'delusion' and 'attracts charlatans'
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:42:32
What about UK?
@_date: 2019-06-11 12:08:33
So I try and explain bitcoin to friends and family. But they keep counter arguing with "what if" and "what if". How can I counter argue that shit argument?
@_date: 2019-12-21 10:02:57
This sounds like mormons
@_date: 2019-04-18 23:53:50
How did they do that? Or how could I leave a comment on a transaction or coinbase
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:11:16
Yo wtf
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:37:24
It's great that we hate each other for coin choices. But we unite for fraudsters. We unite together. Well done. Good job!!
@_date: 2019-04-26 21:43:08
What's so wrong about having a custodial lightning node?
@_date: 2019-04-06 13:44:01
 I have retrieved btc from coinbase to a bc1 address. Ex. Coinbase to Wasabi wallet
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:39:27
Relax. It will eventually go through. I sent a 2 sat byte last week. It took 2 days but got there
@_date: 2019-04-12 11:03:08
I think the community makes it quiet aware that not your keys not your bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:12:31
Hi I'm utility. Who the hell are you without me?
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:45:50
Yes. I got worried. It eventually would be sent back to the address it was sent from
@_date: 2019-12-19 22:42:24
Depends on how long you hodl those freshly minted coins. The difficulty of the network. The price.
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:25:04
Wow. Thank you for that. Then it would be invalidated if it gets mined?
I would assume so. Amazing love bitcoin so much. Its fascinating
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:32:57
Bitcoin atm
@_date: 2019-04-23 16:08:10
I very recently was sending btc to my stack. No rush. So I sent 2 satoshi per byte. Took me 2 days to get confirmed. But it did. Save sats
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:45:07
I've sold brothers. I've sold! I'm sorry, I can't see this happening to my portfolio. I will be back later, I promise. (I sold yesterday)
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:46:57
Yeah i once went to an atm and by accident bought BCH and sent it to a btc adrress. Waste of 100 quid
@_date: 2019-09-27 23:26:24
What episode is this?
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:58:29
Just think long term. 5 years. Thank yourself later
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:28:01
I think of only investing in bitcoin. Bitcoin didn't need an ICO to show its value. Neither was it pre mined
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:09:08
There are many other places to buy bitcoin other than coinbase hence 
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:11:37
Oh no, in 2 years she will be back. In some years this big boy will have all the babes he wants and a lambo. 
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:58:54
He doesn't need none of this. He doesn't need to be sold at a price. He is unique

Bitcoin ATM
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:05:02
Why use a credit card?
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:11:20
It could only crash if people are willing to lose allot of money
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:15:25
This may be correct. That's why I use wasabi wallet. Let's hope schnorr signatures gets a good implementation. So that blockchain analysis becomes irrelevant. (If I'm not mistaken. I'm still learning about schnorr signatures) Use wasabi wallet. You pay a really small fee and your coins are anonymous
@_date: 2019-05-07 10:39:26
Bch ir bsv whale? Just so they can say the average btc transaction is ridiculous high?
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:40:00
Is it possible to retrieve bitcoin that was sent to a bitcoin cash address?
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:18:42
I have a trezor one. The safety is the same on both devices. Doesn't make a difference. Only one has a touch screen
