store it on a smartphone wallet for starters if you want to have it with you at all times, or send it directly to a paper wallet.

you should put it on a wallet as fast as possible but it depends on the amout. The transaction fees can eat most of it if you don't have much.

I couldn't buy the dip because of fucking coinbase. Ima hop on every other exchange. My issue was that they were the only ones accepting virtual cards generated through my banking app.

Just want to buy some and hodl for months. Do you guys think it will go back to 14k in the next 24h? 
2) Could this be the biggest bubble ever and we're just halfway?

I just need to go back to 16k real fast so I can sell my weakest position with no losses
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:04:26

I moved away from my home town for a couple of months and left my Ltc and BTC paper wallets over there. Now I have a thrill checking the graphs daily like a wildlife explorer staring at chimpanzes. That's how you HODL.
