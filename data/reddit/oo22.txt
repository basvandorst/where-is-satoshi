This is genius

Ya, i'm looking at the cryptomarket as a whole atm.. so I don't take anything specific into consideration like the lightning network.  But I agree with your thesis.  If 8-9k holds it's steady as she goes.. otherwise, batten down the hatches for new lows!
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:34:39
It makes me sick to think of ppl getting in at 19.8k.. The bubble's popping and reverting to the mean line which is around 8k.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:37:59
This is why i'm shorting the shit out of shitcoins right now
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:40:40
Bingo.. I also predict a return to a mean price of about 8k.. So easy to just draw a line from like 2013 straight through to see the bubble... Short those shitcoins!

I mean, sure. Nobody knows for sure about anything but we need to use predictions and analysis to make a thesis about it's direction no?
I'm not just "talking". I've based my opinion on my analysis and the study of past bubbles.  Also, why does everyone think because something is reverting to the "normal" it's going down? it just means it will go forward (up) from 8-9k.. it will probably hit 19k again some day.. just look at the dot com bubble.. we've passed that recently

bitfinex.com, is fun watching ppl fight the technicals, you can't win against bots with dump trucks of money! follow the trend down.

This is where the mean line for BTC is no?  it's clearly in bubble territory right now and it's just normalizing. If it falls below 8k then it turns into a serious downtrend.

Ah, touche

Bitcoin could operate with much less miners then it has at the moment.  The difficulty changes based on volume as well.  Everyone's just in it for a piece of that sweet sweet pie atm.
Edit: sweat = sweet..
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:25:55
give me one good reason it should go back to $19k? because you 'willed' it there? there's more then 1 currency out there in the world that doesn't exist anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:31:52
ahh.. you know you've won the argument when the name calling begins
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:41:29
To back up your point, here's some [pudding for your proof](
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:27:18
That's not really how currencies work.  The value of the currency should not deter buyers because you can always buy as much or as little as you want. BUT! i agree with bitcoin not hitting 19k again for at least another 15 years
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:48:35
I guess it's relative to what you want it for right?  If you actually plan on spending the £ it doesn't really matter to you if it goes from 1 to 19 because the price of bread won't change per-se.  As an investment vehicle though, absolutely.  Again though it's relative to something like USD or EUR.

The unique properties i believe are currently the fact that its unregulated and most likely being heavily manipulated because if said un-regulation.
That uniqueness will quickly disappear once the governments lock it down just like all other asset classes.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:38:50
You can send and recieved as much Bitcoin as you like. But if nobody accepts it for real goods and services then it's kinda useless no?  At the end of the day you can't pay your bills in crypto and if you could it would be regulated
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:49:59


Right there? You want a magnifying glass to help you too?
@_date: 2019-09-14 14:52:59
This right here.. people need to do a little reading about how Bitcoin fits into the whole monetary system and the problems it was designed to solve. There lots of material out there I won't even begin to list.

It's the "stock-to-flow" of bitcoin that gives it value:
A small quote from the first hit on google:


As previously mentioned, it is not possible to copy or forge Bitcoins, and the total supply is strictly limited. All transactions are written in blocks, i.e 'the blockchain', and nobody can spend coins that belong to someone else's bitcoin address. A Bitcoin address is akin to a bank account in which you can make deposits, but without providing access to the all important private keys that are required to spend its contents. That is where "scarcity" comes into play. The dictionary definition of scarcity is when something is difficult to come across in nature or in the lab; very similarly to precious metals. Once something becomes scarce enough, it can be used as a money. Stock to flow is defined as a relationship between production and current stock that is out there.
