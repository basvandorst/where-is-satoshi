Money held within a payment service like Paypal or Venmo doesn't actually belong to you until you've withdrawn it to your bank account. Paypal has a 180 day window where the buyer can file a chargeback. 
Isn't that ridiculous? Months after a transaction has been made, a buyer can claim random bullshit like "lol it was unauthorized" and "lol I didn't get the goods (even though they were received within 10 minutes of payment" without any proof on their behalf, forcing me to spend hours building a case against them.
In contrast, once a Bitcoin transaction has been confirmed by the network, it is final. 


Paypal has a 2.9% transaction fee for people selling goods with it (I haven't ever used Venmo due to its policies). On the other hand, someone sending $400 to me paid just over $1 in fees! Looking back at my transaction history, most transactions had a tx fee of under $1 (at the time each tx was sent). All but one transaction (which was sent by someone who paid a tx fee of 30 cents pre-Segwit, which took 3 days to complete) were completed within a couple hours. The $400 transaction took under 15 minutes to be confirmed!

This. I'd rather use a BTC where transactions are final, even if I had to wait a couple hours for transaction confirmation. A couple hours for confirmation is infinitely preferable to the risk of a notice coming from PayPalCashCoin 6 months after the transaction saying "lol the sender claims the transaction was unauthorized we're taking your money get fucked".

I'm with this guy, it's very possible we could see another major correction within the next few months. The price would eventually recover and I don't think it would be as bad as the previous ones, but you could still find yourself cucked out of $10k while you don't have a new roof for a year.
