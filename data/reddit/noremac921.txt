If bitcoin dies... all of these coins die right beside it.  None of them make it. The geeks and early adopters won't/aren't making these cryptos a success - it requires and will continue to require the main stream every day person getting involved to make it successful - right? wrong?

But when Antonopoulos confirmed they actually had more bitcoin in cold/offline storage than they claimed they did... doesnt this make the coins as safe as they can be? If im insured up to 98% - thats good enough for me and most average joes... especially when you consider the risk/rewarding if the market goes the way many think it will.

I dont think the entire world will rely on bitcoin for a very very long time

really not trying to be a dick here...
So we need a tankcoin for wars? a grocery coin for the grocery store?... soccermom coin to buy gatorades at socceer games? Potcoin for pots and pans (isn't that what it's used for?).... OH how about ChurchCoins that automatically decrease by 10% every sunday!? anything else you can cook up let me know!

Antonopolous is on the JRE podcast again today at noon pst.  
I know there are going to be a lot of them... what im asking is why? what do they do? what purpose do they hold?

I agree with the govt/bureaucracy restrictions. 
I just think people would lose faith and it would take the crypto world a very long time to recover if btc left the game.

my goal is to get you people to stop paying attention to the fucking sheep out here... who the fuck cares about it touching $300 - no one - it means jack shit - it does this all the time - all the fucking time.  I consider it fairly productive to give my time to you - so you can stop wasting your life looking at this fucking waste of life. Now move along and be thankful for my sacrifice.
