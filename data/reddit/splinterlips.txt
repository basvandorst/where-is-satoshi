I ordered mine on Black Friday and it's still not here.  How long did yours take to arrive?  I felt a little better when I found out it is coming from the Czech Republic.  Following the tracking it says it arrived in NYC last week, I'm in Maine.  I figured it would be here for xmas.  I got an update this morning, now it's in San Fransisco.  WTF USPS?  Oh well, I guess I was naughty this year.  It looks cool.  I can't wait.

I got in at the same time, I've lost about the same amount, and I'm going to keep buying in until it hits 25$.  
PS I have no idea what I'm doing I'm just stubborn.  
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:58:52
I like your optimism. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 17:30:04
I agree.  I'm just having trouble wrapping my mind around the purpose of this rule.

Stay up for the night.

Whelp,  I'm sorry if I confused anybody. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:19:09
Based totally on conjecture I think it would be a 10 to 20 percent drop with a fairly short recovery time. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:56:02
History is a good indication of this.

I prefer this to that tired meme.  Well played

BOOO!  BOOO!

I going to venture a guess that this is LA.  The name First Entertainment Credit Union sounds ridiculous any where else.
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:42:49
I'm sorry,  what was this post about again? I got distracted. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 00:02:30
I hope they get it back up soon so I can continue to obsess over the price. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:10:00
These are exciting times!

It's sad but I do look forward to these tired memes when there is price action. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:49:01
I was waiting for this video to pop up.  Thanks
@_date: 2017-01-29 13:18:40
Yeah, if you can set up a Coinbase account.....   
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:01:39
This is exactly my story as well, give or take 5 dollars on all the numbers, minus the $100 coins.  Just keep Hodling on. 
@_date: 2017-01-29 13:19:25
I was intimidated too but it turns out to be pretty easy. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 02:13:44
... about cheap coins?

Dude, the line points up.  It's science! 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:53:30
I hope bitcoin gets you out of it. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:10:31
They are not looking to hold it.   They are trying to get some cash off of a credit card. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:11:49
remindme!  Dec 31. Just for fun

I couldn't convince my girlfriend to buy at 800.  I took some serious ridicule.  Fast forward to last month and now she is my ex and I get a text from out of the blue..  "OMG, how many Bitcoins do you have?"   That was mighty satisfying! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:28:55
My response was "Do you think it's appropriate ask for me to ask you how much you have in your 401k?"      
@_date: 2016-02-12 13:58:36
I put 100 bucks on Continental Bank in 1990.  Fuck me! They didn't even make the sweet 16.  
@_date: 2016-09-28 13:49:29
Damn. 
@_date: 2016-09-28 11:35:12
What does you being targeted look like? What can Coinbase do to you if you aren't one of their users? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:47:21
I hope he keeps talking.   He will either look foolish or cause another dip.  I got more coin at 3100. Thanks Jamie and China.  
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:15:07
I wanted to see the different reasonings.

Ron Paul and ToTheMooGuy are the best parts of a price spike.
@_date: 2016-10-29 03:57:26
Wait for it....  Wait for it...
@_date: 2016-07-15 02:20:41
The first time you were on is what got me curious about Bitcoin.  Now I'm all in.  Thanks
