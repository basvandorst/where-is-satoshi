Taking the sage advice of relatives and selling 12 btc at 80 to recoup my initial investment. Never again...
At least it allowed someone else to enjoy cheap btc :D

I cannot recommend CaVirtex. I sent a payment using a Taype transfer (something they no longer support and did not notify me of) in Octover and the funds took over a month to appear. In that time span bitcoin had 2x'd in value. I had contacted them about the issue numerous times. 9/10 you can't get a hold of anyone. The few times I do, I get the run around and told the funds will appear soon...but  weeks later - no funds. One agent said that I woulnd't be so frustrated if the price of btc had gone down instead! That should be my choice to make! Their fees are also far too high - impossible to make money trading.

"Virtex technicians will have the site back online as soon as possible. Sorry for the inconvenience." as per their twitterfeed

Go for it.
The pain of loosing 500$ &lt; the pain of knowing you could have made much, much more.

I tried buying bitcoin last week with CaVirtex and tried to get verified. I lost patience and just did a money transfer (glad I did). It's been 11 days and still haven't heard anything. 
I'm going to migrate to libertybit because 3% is beyond excessive.

Thanks for the  I gave them a call and was connected to a nice lady, she said she hadn't heard of this problem, that they were in a meeting and they would call me back. I'll let you know if/when I hear back from them.

Not good. I sold right before it went down - looks like I dodged a bullet. Hope it comes back soon!

Picked up some shares the other day. Pretty cool that you can invest in something non-btc related with btc!

My strategy was to do a long term hold - just set it and forget it....Except I can't forget it! I'm waking up in the middle of the night checking the prices. Torturing myself whether or not I should cash out and enjoy the nice profit.
But I decided to stick with my guns and sink or swim with the success of my new obsession.
