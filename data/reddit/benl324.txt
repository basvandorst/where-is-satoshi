Normal to what degree? What percentage drop will you accept before you sell? I know I sound like a panicking investor but I am holding. 
I want to know if this is directly affected by the BTC meeting in China over the weekend. 
There are serious macro trends that I'm trying to get a grasp on, specifically the BRIC countries adopting a cryptocurrency in lieu of the dollar. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 15:17:00
An older but a goodie, specifically referencing China. Do your homework for the other countries.

What exchange has the fastest transaction times? I love the ease of Coinbase as well but I HATE waiting (Millennials). 
That being said, what market offer faster delivery of BTC? I will always keep my Coinbase account but aside from instant buys and local purchases, I need to find faster options.

It's sold on an exchange, whether a commodity or a stock, every financial instrument is capable of being destroyed/brought to zero value. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:05:43
Sounds pretty generic, sarcastic and ignorant :)

BTC down more than 10% in 3 days, all you "buy and hold" people, shut up.
All you FOREX people, think we are reaching a fork?
Any technical analysis would be greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:02:18
YTD it is up $328 but let's not get into semantics. The surge from last year came from the lack of miners/advanced mining hardware. 
Watch your words, if the market shakes out the weak, and nobody reacts, then everyone left with BTC loses if it continues to crash. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:01:11
It seems like Mycelium is the consensus so far. Does it have the same anonymity features as Electrum?
Also, would everyone use these wallets versus an exchange like Coinbase? I'm sure the answer is yes but I thought I'd ask anyway. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:47:55
Accurate indeed, sir.

Gold and silver are going up, oil is dipping, I don't see any correlations. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:05:18
Yes, macro trends, things that make the world go round (aside from physics, of course). 
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:46:22
Lack was the wrong word, there were LESS miners and LESS advanced hardware available and a reasonable price. That is more specific. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:19:30
There's my answer! I had to look a little further down the screen. Chinese miners did not get what they went, and they don't take kindly to that. Makes perfect sense. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:07:32
Define "us"... Investors? 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:07:29
1. No, it is inferred and you have to do your own homework and have a modicum of intelligence, go do your homework. 
2. That's one of the most ignorant comments I've read from this post. The government of China is purchasing more BTC than any single entity in the world, of course BTC is relevant to China. 
3. I consider many websites reliable sources of news, I take the information I find valuable and I apply my own theories to it to better understand macro trends.

Yeah it sucks,  Circle is owned by Coinbase so I guess they don't want to compete with themselves. Between that and the IRS demanding Coinbase to turn over user info, I think it's safe to stay away from both websites. 
Coinmama is the best I've found so far, heftier fees but always deliver. 
@_date: 2019-08-06 19:23:55
Sure, and the team and everyone else will dump.
@_date: 2019-08-09 07:50:17
Nothing to say to my comments? Probably because I told the truth and you don't like hearing it.
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:55:29
Perhaps the platform should not advertise itself as a place to make money by posting, then they wouldn't be lying.
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:07:42
Seems you are drinking Kool-Aid and not looking at the facts laid in front of you. This is the truth, don't be mad with people who tell the truth, just the ones pulling the wool over your eyes. You seem to not understand how Uptrennd has failed to deliver on its promise and it is not the future, it is a presently functioning platform in beta that is essentially a crypto-only version of Reddit where you cannot redeem/withdraw the points you earn for any value. That is reserved for team members only at this point from what the charts show.
@_date: 2019-08-07 08:46:49
She's been making very valid points that Jeff is too afraid to answer honestly. 
Like the fact that I was "fired for poor performance" the only thing performing poorly is Uptrennd and its correlating token price.
@_date: 2019-08-07 06:31:12
Plenty of other stuff happened, the creator, Zach Dash and I came to full disagreements on everything because, like you, he does not take criticism well. So I did the same to them that I did to Uptrennd, dumped my tokens and left but in BOMB's case, Zach was so afraid of me he blocked me faster than I could leave the channels. You were much slower to the punch.
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:36:30
CoinMama works great, and they even take credit card. 
Once approved, it is not instant deposit, it's standard 45-minute transfer into your wallet. 
I've been scouring the internet to find sites/apps that allow purchase of BTC in all forms and fashions. 
@_date: 2019-08-16 04:39:50
Now this is how you teach people!
@_date: 2019-08-16 02:58:03
Lol did that comment really need to be made? The token price is looking wonderful at the moment.
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:58:24
Oh this is rich! I got fired?! Lol. I told you how screwed up the project was and washed my hands of it then was blocked by you on all social channels. 
Fired, LMFAO. I ran away from Uptrennd as soon as I saw how messed up the token metrics were structured. 
I love the way you remember things, you wake up every morning pissing excellence and shitting rainbows, Jeff. Surely you cannot be wrong considering you infallible.
@_date: 2019-08-09 07:47:24
Looking forward to this! Going to be a wild ride for 1UP's price.
@_date: 2019-08-07 06:29:18
I think we have reached "agree to disagree" here.
@_date: 2019-08-16 02:59:52
Oh and you have no incentives. It was just a fuck-up that should have been live from Day 1 but Jeff doesn't see things very clearly.
@_date: 2019-08-06 15:07:16
I told them I don't believe in the project, dumped and got blocked by Zachary Dash because, like you, he does not like criticism.
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:11:15
I was with the Uptrennd team for one month (January 2019) and realized this will never work. Employees are being paid in tokens and users cannot withdraw them. Uptrennd now claims that employee tokens are locked up for a year, looks like people are not following the rules. There is no way someone can exchange a 1UP point for a 1UP token worth 5 cents, the market dictates the price and currently, that price is barely 1 cent.

So many crazies! Then they go straight for the downvote. I feel like we're in the middle of a Cold War.

Could be major buys on a large exchange, could be a lot of bullish buyers just went nuts. It will be more interesting to see 24 hours from now and examine how the alts reacted after the pump.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:57:03
Can't we do both? Pay people using it as currency as well as store it for future value like standard commodities?

Damn, well said! What a great synopsis. The more posts I read over there I realize they are not having discussions but constantly shilling. What a sad community.

Buy alts while they are still on the dip. Consider it a fire sale!!

I truly believe these are people who have been converted to the dark side and the rest are paid by Ver using the tippin system. They are tipping each other BCH like it's candy.

Same, saw the chart and was happy to see it sitting at $8k, now it needs to fly!
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:56:38
Great opportunity to swap btc on the pump for some alts.
