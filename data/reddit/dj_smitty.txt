Haha it took me like a combined 5 minutes to complete 3 tasks. I figured I can do about 10 a day and in less than a week i will have 180. How long does it take to level up?

I'm not quite sure what you are asking

Haha thanks, didn't seem too complicated. Can I up my max for the next transaction? and also, is your bitcoin price negotiable, I saw that its about $100 per coin above market price.
edit: nvm, read your last message from the bitcoin site. Aight, so two more times, anyway we can up my max to $100 for the next time?

dark net markets. I bought hardly any though

thank you, and what is a good method of payment. Cash is my preferred option if possible. But I also have a debit card

I like your method, especially cuz there is a well fargo right across the street from me. I have the cash ready now, so what do we need to do before I go to wells fargo.
edit: hold on though, getting food will be right back and want to do this transaction ASAP. after i eat though

Implying that people on the internet black market are even given a fair trial.

Ok so I found a seller, all i need is my wallet number and I should be good to go?

damn those websites seem like a lot work, is this what the guide meant by bitcoin mining? Because if so, it suggest a a high-end CPU which my macbook is most certainly not.
