I don't think it's necessarily that people are taking Gox's side. I guess people just don't like the fact that there was a lawsuit at all and the resulting media attention. Lawsuits are seen as negative by people and just the fact that Coinlab filed a lawsuit (regardless of whether or not there was merit) is looked down upon.
Edit: Not that I'm trying to say I think it's rational. Just how I think people see it.

But FDIC only applys to USD, not BTC. And Coinbase holds BTC on behalf of users, not USD. When you buy BTC on Coinbase, you transfer USD to Coinbase. Coinbase never holds your USD.

There should be no reason that they are unable to do an ACH transfer to your savings account.

Maybe, but a transaction is not necessarily the same as spending. I can generate a bitcoin address and send all my coins to myself. I don't think that really makes the market any more or less healthy.

It's not really good or bad. It's just a way to look at bitcoin transactions. It adds weight to the old bitcoins that haven't been moved for a while.

Still waiting. Maybe the delay is related to the recent news regarding Tradehill no longer using IAFCU and the IAFCU experiencing regulatory issues.

You can read the rest with a free account. It doesn't cost anything.
He goes on to say that while USD has lost 98% of its value, that was over 100 years for an inflation rate of 3.75%. Bitcoin dropped 90% in a single day. The author would rather have the 98% loss over 100 years where he can plan and adjust for inflation.
His next point is that bitcoin is not a functional unit of value. Businesses will go bankrupt due to the menu costs associated with bitcoin.
His last point is that currencies must be legal and accepted for the payment of taxes. He mentions Liberty Reserve's shutdown and the California cease and desist. He figures since Silicon Valley is in California and California has issues with bitcoin, that all other states will have issues with bitcoin. He uses the following quotation to imply that bitcoin is illegal under US federal law.




His conclusion is, summarized, that both gold and bitcoin are supported by pillars made of sand, but that bitcoin has the added risk of being shut down by the government.
Edit: Its unfortunate, because I just had an article rejected by SA for not offering any new analysis. It compared bitcoin with credit cards and wire transfers and I thought it did a good job of offering a balanced look at the pros and cons of each.
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:24:11
I don't really understand the use case myself.
The idea is that it is better than just looking at the number of bitcoins transacted, because someone can just send the same bitcoins from address to address all day long.
So I send 0.5 BTC 50 times in a day. If we are just looking at bitcoins transacted, that is 25 BTC. With bitcoin days destroyed, that would be 0.5 BTC because the sum of 0.5 BTC times each fraction of the day will only add up to 0.5.
So it is an attempt to get a more accurate picture of the bitcoins transacted.
@_date: 2013-07-28 20:45:23
They do say that they keep a large portion of customer's bitcoins in offline storage. Maybe they didn't have enough bitcoins online and had to go to the bank to retrieve some from cold storage.

They do use bitpay to deposit bitcoins. After 6 confirms, you have the equivalent USD balance in your Namecheap account.

I posted on Bricklink in the past and was dismissed. I sell. They should just add it. It's just another payment option at checkout. Sellers can choose to accept it. Nothing special has to be done on Bricklink's end, since each seller would be responsible for a method of accepting bitcoins.

I think CodyFP probably means what is the longest vanity address that someone actually has the private key for.
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:19:09
The units are bitcoin days destroyed, because you are multiplying the number of bitcoins times the number of days since the last transaction with those bitcoins. So you are "destroying" the streak of not spending. So the units are not just bitcoins or days, it's bitcoin days.
If you add up the bitcoin days destroyed for each transaction in a day, you get the bitcoin days destroyed for that day. This is what the blockchain.info chart displays.

Maybe I'm just misinterpreting what he said. It sounded to me like he thought it was just the sum of the age of the bitcoins.

You can run bitcoind on a server. You connect to the peer-to-peer network to download the blockchain. Then you can somehow parse the blockchain for the addresses you are interested in. You would either need to use an open source blockchain parser or write your own. Running bitcoind yourself is the best option, since you don't rely on the honesty of a third party.
The easier way would be to query a website like blockchain.info. The website would be running bitcoind on their server. The blockchain.info api is [here]( In particular, look at the Single and Multi Address api calls. You can implement other websites to verify that the data from blockchain.info is correct.
EDIT: As zoiks1 said, you should also use an api for the exchange rate, so you can list the value of the BTC in USD or some other currency. Blockchain.info also has an [api]( for that. I am not sure on the formula, but it uses some sort of average of the exchange prices, since the price varies from exchange to exchange.

One disadvantage of keeping it in bitcoins is if you have to pay an expense in USD. You can't guarantee that you will have at least $1,000 worth of bitcoin at some point in the future. The exchange rate may drop.
An advantage of keeping it in bitcoins is that you have more control over the money and can choose how and in what amounts it can be spent.

Did you use the contact form on their website. I did that once and never received a response.

Also people offering and accepting different payment methods. Some use cash, money orders, bank transfer, OkPay, etc.
@_date: 2013-06-29 19:23:25
They have been accepting bitcoins for a while. I am pretty sure it used to be after PayPal, and that is why OP posted this.
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:11:04
Basically, it is a measure of the sum of the bitcoins that were sent in a day, but it is weighted by the number of days since the bitcoins were last used in a transaction (or since the bitcoins were generated).
So sending 1 BTC that was last spent 5 days ago counts as 5 bitcoin days destroyed. Sending 5 BTC that was last spent 1 day ago also counts as 5 bitoin days destroyed.
If a miner mines 25 BTC and then waits 100 days to spend them, that results in 2500 bitcoin days destroyed. If we change the wait time to 5 days, then we need to spend 500 BTC to result in 2500 bitcoin days destroyed. So a high number of bitcoin days destroyed means that either old coins that haven't moved for a long time are moving, or that someone with a large number of bitcoins are spending them (or both).
Edit: The blockchain.info chart displays the sum total bitcoin days destroyed for all the transactions in a single day.

Yes, I should have said that Bitcoin's monetary inflation is predictable. Technically the currency's value going down is a possible result of inflation, but not inflation itself. Today, people talk about inflation and a decrease in the value of a currency as being the same thing.

Yes, they do, though they have private registration, so it doesn't need to appear in the whois database.
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:41:04
Because you are "destroying" the streak that existed of the bitcoins not being sent.
Those bitcoins weren't spent for x days and now you are starting back at 0 days.
@_date: 2013-07-28 21:55:53
But the thing is, $1k BTC may not be $1k when you need that $1k. You may have some sort of USD denominated bill. If you don't have $1k on a certain date, then you are in trouble. If you purchased $1k worth of bitcoins when it was north of $200/BTC, you would still not have $1k worth of bitcoins.
I get what you are saying, that over the long run the exchange rate has gone up. However, there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so, and if you really need $1,000 USD at some point in the future, it is best to leave it as $1,000 USD, even if inflation outpaces interest.
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:58:23
Don't forget to spell check!
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:45:52
But there isn't a built-in RPC for getting the balance of an address that is not in your wallet. So they would have to use a program to manually parse the blockchain for transactions to or from the addresses they are interested in.
So from an integration standpoint, simply querying a 3rd party is easier.

It is a cash deposit. The buyer of the bitcoins deposits cash into the seller's bank account. The advantage over cash is that anyone with a local Chase branch can buy bitcoins even if they do not have a Chase account. You do not need to live near the seller.
The buyer sent the seller a picture of the receipt over the Internet as proof that the buyer made a deposit, but it turns out he just printed a fake receipt and photographed that.

Seems like a bad choice of name. I wonder if localbitcoins has always had "online" buying. Though from the buyer's perspective, cash deposit is local, since they go to a local bank branch.
