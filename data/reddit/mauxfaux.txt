I'm not sure how your legal team came up with this doozy as it would be clearly illegal in many of the jurisdictions that you operate in.
You are clearly placing the interests of shareholders and creditors ahead of clients, who have done absolutely nothing outside of depositing funds with Bitfinex to contribute to this loss.
Such a proposal would be tossed by any bankruptcy judge as the *first* losers should be those that are responsible for the actual loss (i.e. the corporation itself, its shareholders, and then its creditors).
I totally get that you would love to remain in business and pretend that this didn't happen, but the law doesn't allow you to create such moral hazard by transferring assets of those who are innocent to protect the assets of those who actually created the loss. 
There's no way that this action *won't* get litigated. What you are proposing is effectively a Ponzi scheme and is illegal on its face.
For full transparency, I'm not a Bitfinex client nor am I involved in BTC in any way.

That's some serious DOGE. Care to tip me a couple ten grand! :-D

Fun fun fun!
Except each time there is negative press about any crypto currency (and there will be about Auroracoin), the average lay person's confidence in all crypto currencies takes a hit. Making mass adoption of any crypto currency that much harder. 
Nice job, assholes.

No, but I do know that humans, in general, do not act against their economic interests.
Despite your technical interest in the currency, the value that you are able to derive from it is directly correlated to how much bitcoin can be exchanged for real goods and real services. It's disingenuous for you to therefore suggest that you have absolutely no stake in the "value" of your holdings.
Your original post waxes on poetically about how you "will always have your bitcoin, no matter what happens." Well that really means fuck-all if bitcoin has no value, and the only value that this currently has—as we've now both stipulated—is in the value that *people*, not algorithms, ascribe to it.
You seem to think that the only destabilizing force is a central authority, like a government, but that's been proven over and over again with bitcoin to be untrue. A single bad actor can have huge ramifications on this market, and as more and more "investors" are robbed or lose confidence in their ability to keep or exchange bitcoin, the lower the value of your holdings will be.


Whatever floats your boat, man.


I really don't give a shit about the exchange rate. I don't have any BTC holdings. But there are plenty of people who have lost real money who do.

You realize that there is an entire class of people who barter (i.e.: trade goods and services) without using currency, right? And they are far from homeless. Eschewing traditional currency may make you an oddball—and certainly isn't going to make you wealthy—but you will hardly be homeless. People have engaged in barter since the dawn of time.
BTW, why do you think black markets are so prevalent in oppressive societies? Could it be that people are opting out of the legal tender of their country to exchange in units that have value? Are these black marketeers homeless?


Bullshit. The exchange rate is a barometer of the "value" that your coin has relative to the stuff you want to consume. You can't reasonably say that you could give a shit wether the same widget costs you 10 BTC on Monday vs. 100 BTC on Friday.
And even if you are this self deluded so that you really don't care, guess who does? Real businesses. Good luck exchanging your bitcoin for goods and services when the limited number of vendors who transact in this currency if the value plummets. Businesses exist to make money, not further religious dogma.

This can only be good news for bitcoin!!!

Except "crypto" doesn't necessarily imply decentralization. Just that it's based on cryptography.

No currency is "mandatory." All currencies are used as a convenience for barter, i.e. the exchange of goods and services. In other words, nobody makes you use USD—the fact that businesses can and do accept cryptocurrency is proof of this.
All currency is subject to manipulation. In fact, this entire community is a perfect microcosm showing how the actions of a few bad actors can manipulate an entire market. 


Anything of "value" has the same property. Value is symbolic, whether it's gold, USD, my pants, or bitcoin.


Why do you own bitcoin? Why are you holding bitcoin? Are you buying on the dips? My guess is that you are more motivated by greed—i.e. the belief that your holdings will rise in value—rather than the convenience of holding a currency that most legitimate business won't transact in.

HELP!!! Let's anoint a centralized spokesman to represent our decentralized currency!!!
Haha. You guys are rich.

What, exactly, was offensive about it?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:15:21


Bitcoins are no different. All currency is symbolic. The only thing providing "value" to bitcoin are the thousands of speculators who ascribe some kind value to them.

It's a basic fact when you are investing in securities. But you didn't buy a stock or a bond (ie: a securitized asset), you exchanged one currency for another. There is a key difference.
Your currency has lost value, and it's a real loss because it affects the amount of goods and services you can now exchange that currency for.
People don't use securities to buy widgets. More importantly, they _can't_ use securities to buy widgets. They can buy them, and they can sell them, and their profit or loss is recorded when they close out the transaction.
However, people DO use currency to but widgets. Today, you can afford less widgets than you could yesterday. Meaning your currency has lost value.

Haha. I deserve that. :-)

Bitcoin is not a security, it's a currency. So yes, you have recorded a loss even if you didn't "sell," the loss being recorded in the reduction of the amount of goods and services you are able to exchange for a deflated currency. 
Bitcoin assets are not securitized, they are real, tangible, liquid monies. That you can supposedly buy shit with. 
The only real way to justify your claim is to stipulate that the real value of Bitcoin is simply derived in how much it is worth in fiat currency (eg: USD), not how much it is worth intrinsically. Which sort of negates a major underpinning of the entire premise of Bitcoin and makes it appear much more like a securitized, speculative asset (stock, bond, option, contract, tulip) than an actual currency.
Edit: changed "in" to "of."

Or, you could be underestimating how much more important the RMB is to the Chinese economy and power base.
Occam's razor and all that. 
Edit: never mind, you are making the same point I did. My bad!

Bitcoins have no "intrinsic value." No currency does.
The "value" of bitcoins is solely based on what people are willing to exchange for them.
Have you all learned nothing?
