This is good positive thought. Competition is good for a community. I am glad you went a logical route and not straight to hate or dismissal. Bit, I would edit that lower case 'i'.

I am a twitch streamer, I accept dogecoin on my channel since twitch doesn't allow smaller streamers to take subscribers buttons. 
I have viewers who basically have taken it upon themselves to say "Hey i dig your content, I am going to donate 10000 D a month as if I was subscribed."
I would love to do something like this with bitcoin, honestly. I am not huge by any means, but I have been at this for over a year and a half, I have been endorsed by some huge names in gaming, youtube and streaming, and even with that and some large numbers and audiences, twitch won't allow me to have a sub button. 
The ability to use dogecoin, or bitcoin as a way to make streaming a bit more profitable, or just sustainable, would be amazing. A bitcoin wallet doesn't have an age attached to use it, much like dogecoin. This could open up a way for younger kids to donate or even the tech suave who already are invested into bitcoin. It opens up possible exposure and adds more flexibility and viability to the currency. 
I like the idea. I wish I could accept bitcoin for my streams.

Agreed.

So what are the implications of this? Would this show that MtGox is holding funds or is it more like someone trying fraudulent activity?

I double checked and it said that my new balance is 0
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:57:34
See I don't even know, I don't know if I ever started a wallet. What would you recommend?
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:11:54
Its not an individuals job, its the community as a whole that needs to make it happen.

I wish I had never lost my 5 coin. Back when bitcoin was new and exciting, I traded something for a couple coins here and there, and like many, I didn't see much value. I lost my Wallet on a bad HDD and now I have .000005 or something of a coin. lol. 
Sad day :( I would buy the shit out of those hides and use them for Leather crafting.

While you know your intention, others do not. They may see it as an effortless win win situation and it could encourage them to continue the trend of doing nothing.

I would love to, but I barely understand the basics of bitcoin. Not quite sure how to receive or check my balance. Someone tried to show me before, but Didn't explain things well.

It wasn't a shibe that posted this, it was a bitcoiner. He is creating an open discussion on the state of the bitcoin community, which currently is pretty tragic.

There we go, that time it worked. So What do I do with these satoshis?
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:24:41
So what would be the reason behind this? Just to expand out and create alternatives to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:03:35
That's a lazy thought process though, essentially it comes down to "If others can do work and we get a benefit, why not continue doing nothing, we win either way."
That's lazy and extremely toxic. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 04:26:29
I suppose so!
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:16:38
Yes, everyone sell, crash the market for 30 hours so I can buy in a large amount before the ultimate recovery.
@_date: 2014-04-02 05:21:54
You and I sir, think alike!

You and me both brother. I remember when bitcoin was being talked about on chan boards and still new. It was filled with disbelief and excitement, both sides. People were in awe and enjoyed thinking about its uses and properties, just like Dogecoin is now.
But now, now, bitcoin has become a cesspool of asshats and lazy people. They have their wealth so why continue working towards the good of the community, they don't have to, they are done, and the rest just seem bitter. 
The difference between doge and Bitcoin is that when you enter into the bitcoin community, you are beaten down until you conform and realize you don't have a chance around these people, when you enter the dogecoin community, you are praised, welcomed, tipped, helped, and treated as an equal. 
I don't even remember the last time I saw a bitcoin tip, or a random act of bitcoin. It's tuned into a market for investors and money hoarders. Dogecoin works towards the betterment of all shibes, not just ones own digital wallet.
