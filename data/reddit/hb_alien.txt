yeah you can.  if you can log into google, you can get google voice.
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:31:49
How about getting a Google Voice account/number?  The 2FA would be texted there.
@_date: 2017-01-07 16:34:03
wtf.  they only take a utility bill as proof of address?  Not  a bank statement or cable bill?

Also, the Casefile podcast did a mini-series on his case.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:47:55
fucking coinbase is terrible.  i'm in the verification process at a real exchange right now, something i should have done years ago.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:06:32
I'm signing up with Gemini, I'm not familiar with any of them tbh.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:53:47
correction back to 2k or so.
a lot of the newest adopters will lose money and never come back
or i could be wrong...
@_date: 2017-05-05 01:27:29
I'm sure some people are doing that.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:54:36
I sign in to GDAX through Coinbase, is there a different way?  I couldn't sign in for hours today.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:53:12
Meanwhile, I've been waiting for Gemini to verify me for over a month now.
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:18:13
4 weeks here.  Just sent in a paystub and an extra phone number, hopefully that will do it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:24:32
Or you're buying something that might be worthless and obsolete within 2 years.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:51:59
Well, something better could come along and replace it.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:09:45
What a crazy day.  bitstamp back up to 970.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:54:47
Your system is broken because you didn't think of getting quarters ahead of time.
Seriously dude, your apartment complex isn't going to switch to bitcoin when statistically you are probably the only person living there who has even heard of it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:26:13
Nope.  Still dead for me.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:22:49
I'm pretty sure it's a little more than that now.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:44:26
Well, then you should have stopped by a laundromat.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:26:20
Not at the moment...
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:07:43
And most of them are probably watching helplessly as they're waiting the standard 4-5 days to get their coins they already paid for.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:17:29
Coinbase just went from 777 to 690 in minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:52:03


Because most washing machines don't have wi-fi?
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:32:41
Your laundromat doesn't have a change machine?
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:46:02
Might as well have a discussion about it, fuckface.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:21:28
Well, now it's back at 770 again.... and 725.  Jesus.
I think coinbase just died.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:45:34
Coinbase now back alive, but at $564.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:47:03
It's actually the other way around.
Edit:  He fixed it.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:58:56
Right, but if they bought coins at 1100 2 days ago, they're losing money and unable to sell.  I doubt losing 200 per coin in 24hrs is making them happy.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:25:50
Dropping like a rock.  $550 now.
Edit:  Back at $620 within minutes.  WTF? ... $650
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:27:28
I think a bunch of people cashed out and became very rich in the past few minutes.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:17:06
Just hit $800 on BitStamp.
Edit:  Right back up to 900 in 15 minutes, lol.
