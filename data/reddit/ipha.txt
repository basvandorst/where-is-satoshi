You have to be verified to withdraw coins. I'm guessing the verification process requires some proof of Canadian citizenship.

11.04 wasn't a LTS release and support ended for it on 28 October 2012. You should really upgrade.

There's no depending on who you ask here. You could get $600 in your bank account within a week if you wanted.

Back when bitcoin was first started I generated a few. But I didn't think bitcoins would ever be worth anything so I didn't keep the wallet... -_-
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:12:21
greater than (greater than $10,000)
So &gt;= $10,000.02
@_date: 2013-05-24 03:47:30
Hmm, maybe the transaction never got broadcast. Is your client properly connected?
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:57:06
Unless you start out with a very clear idea if what the finished version will be, it's hard to decide when to call something 1.0 or any other whole number.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:22:31
It should have no effect, it's just an arbitrary limit.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:09:11
There isn't any benefit for someone to pay in bitcoins unless they already are holding them. Buying bitcoins just to pay rent wouldn't make much sense.
One address per tenant should work, no need for a new address each month unless you want to.
Yeah, that is a problem with bitcoins. There's no need to transfer it to other accounts though. When you spend it, some will be sent wherever you want and the rest to a change address. As long as you don't reuse addresses it's hard to say which part you kept and which you spent.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:43:09
Fees are usually .1mBTC or .2mBTC per transaction. If you look a the transaction details you should be able to see exactly what the fees were.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:53:11
One of those was mine =(
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:08:04
Yep, for example here's a private key(normally stored encrypted in the wallet): 5JZ8onj3oAR4xmbWBabZieFZXvkG7r3oie39fgm7joQTUxS8umg
and the corresponding public key: 18cDjBQhGaV2yKmNDJ611H7oN9iq7awuqJ
Any one can send money to and check the contents of the public key, but in order to spend the contents you need the private key.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:08:26
In order to crack the password you need a good idea of what the password is. If you can provide enough information for it to be cracked you're either the owner of the wallet or chose a shit password. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 03:20:05
That transaction happened 3 days ago and has 612 confirmations.
@_date: 2013-05-24 03:35:24
Are you sure you got the address right? In that transaction 0.15BTC was sent to 1PDyES38KkYF1mpodXXV5uexkAPXUcvogQ.

There is hardware and software available to filter ddos attacks, but even if you quit replying to the attack it still consumes your downstream bandwidth. And the attackers will usually vary the source of the attack so blocking ip ranges won't work.

Rule  Don't panic sell.

Bitcoin is secure, people are not.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:52:08
It's safe. You can only send money to a public address. The only reason you would want to keep a public address secret is if you didn't want people connecting transfers to/from that address to your identity.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:58:26
I don't know of anyone that will let you do that, to easy to commit fraud.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:21:10
The 3% fee is only if the bank transfer fails and they have to charge the credit card.
@_date: 2013-03-27 05:40:14
You're asking for free money. I'm afraid that doesn't exist.
You can mine bitcoins if you have the hardware for it, or buy them.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:19:01
Who knows? It will certainly be interesting.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:07:59
Where you keep the coins depends on who you want to trust, Coinbase or yourself?
If you want to transfer them to electrum send them to one of your receive addresses that electrum generated for you.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:34:08
Neither. Just odd.
@_date: 2013-05-24 03:54:46
Ahh, there's no problem then. When you import a private key nothing happens in the blockchain, the coins don't move from 1PDyES38KkYF1mpodXXV5uexkAPXUcvogQ you just allowed to spend from that address now.
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:15:17
Keep in mind you have to factor in power costs.
@_date: 2013-08-20 05:01:30
It will come back online and people will keep using it.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:10:35
Who knows? It might keep falling, might rise soon.
However, unless bitcoin fails completely it will probably be back up eventually. Might take a while though.

Assuming a perfectly shuffled deck it would provide 225 bits of entropy, a very good password.
Personally, I trust computers to generate more random numbers than I can. I like electrum's method of creating a memorable key. It creates a mnemonic based on 128 bits of entropy:
    Hex: 723649b33e848de833a0d79f5dfd656d
    Mnemonic: crowd roll stroke human destination clear crush still pretty eternal really smooth
12 common words are easy enough to memorize, and it's secure assuming your PC isn't compromised.

If you really want something to rant about use 'shred'
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:24:17
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:06:57
Don't panic sell and you'll be fine. Unless something catastrophic happens it will be back up eventually.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:12:41
I spent $20 on bitcoins a while ago and I never plan on selling them. Either bitcoins take off and become a common currency or I'm out $20.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:51:59
*uggh* fine take an upvote.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:03:17
Just tried it. "Debit cards currently not supported."
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:45:39
Pretty cool program! I wish you the best of luck with your bitcoin sales
^^no ^^linux ^^support ^^=(
@_date: 2013-02-26 21:16:16
There will still be miners.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:18:27
There is a minimum right now, but if all but one BTC was lost it would be adjusted to allow for a full economy in that one coin.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:23:14
I don't know WTF is happening, but it's fun to watch =D
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:10:32
They're gone forever. Bitcoins are infinitely divisible, so it's not a problem.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:21:12
Because while you can buy and sell just fine on mtgox, if you try to withdraw USD it will take many months before you actually see it. 
People like to use mtgox when talking about the price because it's higher, but it isn't a good estimate of the "real" price. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 20:40:50
The 10 min/block is just the average, sometimes it takes longer, and the miners can choose what transactions get included.
