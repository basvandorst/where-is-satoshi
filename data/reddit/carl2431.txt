I think you are confused. The problems you mention are symptoms of big government. Yes block chain can solve them but it does so in spite of authority not in line with.

Noob on crypto taxes, but is there such thing as a wash sale in this case?
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:37:17
Just checked for US.  Bitcoin is considered property therefore wash sales are not applicable.

Do you feel like your quote is an accurate representation of that article and is attributable to all people who support limited government?  You are in a very defensible position if your quote is truly representative of objective reality, but somehow I smell straw around an argument that may have been inserted to make it easier to knock down.  As I suspect this to be the case: Straw. Man.

Compounding results aren't as intuitive in a inflationary scenario eh.

Honey get the pitchfork! I found me a strawman!

If you have an imagination it can.  Hear me out.  We dictate infrastructure to the government because it would be a logistic nightmare to let the private sector take a crack at it.  But what if there were a currency integrated into our smart-car's technology that allowed the cars to travel and pay private road owners without human intervention.  Roads could become an investment vehicle and stewards would have incentives to keep the roads in good working order in order to lure traffic.  It would all be possible with programmable money.
