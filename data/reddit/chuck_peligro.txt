Yup, that's why I am still holding onto these tulip bulbs.

Serious question: have the prices of things been stable with Bitcoin? It seems to me, from the outside, that the purchasing power of BTC is always pegged at whatever the exchange rate is for whatever currency denomination the good or service acquired is. If that's the case, BTC has failed to be a currency in that it is not a store of value. And if its intended purpose is to be a currency, it's doing a shit job at it.

You're talking about money supply, but using inflation as the term. That's confusing folks. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:32:16


Exactly. And it's now worth 15% of what it was because people are catching on to the fact that it is intrinsically worthless (a big problem for currency that should not be fiat, even though BTC absolutely is fiat); in fact, it has negative value when you account the negative externalities to the environment.

Hayek wrote this in the aftermath of the US dollar losing 10% of its value in a single year. The dollar was nowhere near as stable then as it is right now. The idea of ditching dollars for Bitcoins right now in pursuit of stability is insane. The idea of ditching actual unstable currencies, like Venezuelan bolivares, for Bitcoin is equally stupid when there are better alternatives... like the US dollar.

Wow, there sure are a lot of idiots out there.

My issue with this hedge is the same one I have with gold (especially gold certificates). Say the dollar goes to shit and there is a currency crisis; will people really adopt your "hard" currency in its place? I think it's a massive assumption and not one that I share with you.
And I get the lack of faith in government. I grew up in Brazil in the 80s, inflation was nuts--my savings account would get over 70% interest over the month and still lose purchasing power. But then the government changed in the early 90s and they made economic reforms and they controlled inflation, at last. So it kinda goes both ways with the trust thing. 
Conversely, the government has a lot of financial regulatory power and they will definitely flex their muscles if they perceive any threats from Bitcoin, real or imaginary. So that is some additional risk in the BTC strategy that I am not willing to take.

Businesses don't consult the money supply before raising prices on goods and services. So... very often, to answer your question.

The official rate is fiction, dude. Only people very connected to Maduro can access dollars at those rates because they are artificial and exist to force foreign companies to overspend when they have to do business in Venezuela. It's virtually impossible and therefore meaningless.
The black market rate is much more free-market based than the official rate.
If you were to travel to Venezuela and withdrew money from an ATM using your debit card instead of exchanging dollar bills for bolivares whenever you needed them with one of many eager Venezuelans, you'd probably cut your purchasing power by a factor of three (would have been 100 or more in the recent past).

Pretty sure that if you wait a month, it will be even easier.

I feel for you. I grew up in 1980s Brazil, and hyperinflation is no joke. Never going to forget getting matches or candy instead of change because it was a better store of value. And to think of how rich Venezuela is, and how this is a completely artificial, government-created disaster, really disgusts me.

And when someone asks you how it's working out for you, what do you say?
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:50:25
There is always a black market.

If the goal for these people whose purchasing power is eroding is to store value, they'd be fucking idiots to choose Bitcoin over the US dollar.
@_date: 2018-12-16 11:36:22
Pro money: It's a good unit of account. You can count bitcoin easily and we know how many units it can be divided by.
On the wall: Means of exchange. Bitcoin could definitely be used to buy goods and services, but people seldom use it that way because they're speculating on it being worth more some day.
Anti money: It's a shit store of value. And not just because it's lost value relative to other currencies in the last year; this would be true if it were gaining value like crazy. Deflation is bad for currencies because it motivates people to hoard money rather than spend it due to the potentially higher purchase power in the future, which can grind the economy to a halt. Fact of the matter is, no one knows how much one bitcoin will buy on any given day; that lack of stability is not desirable in money.
Now the thing that really perplexes me is the idea that BTC replaced fiat money. So, during the Bretton Woods system, central banks could exchange US$35 for an ounce of gold. So in essence dollars were backed by gold, though everyone knew that the dollar was grossly overvalued relative to gold at the time, and ultimately the system broke. At that point, the dollar became fiat money, as it is backed by nothing other than a government promise. I don't get how BTC adopters think BTC replaces fiat. Gold, which had intrinsic value, used to back the dollar during Bretton Woods. No such thing of intrinsic value backs BTC. It is fiat, too!

The other thing that cracks me up is the idea that 21,000,000*10^8 units of BTC would be indefinitely enough in the very long run should BTC be widely adopted. The lack of a central bank authority to allow for more mining (or easier mining of current caps) or further divisibility seems like a huge liability and not at all an advantage.
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:35:48
The fact that everyone refers to it as price and no one refers to it as an exchange rate is all you need to know about how Bitcoin is bullshit.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:21:06
So neither Blockchain, nor Bitcoin.
OK, got it.
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:03:02


You're using the official exchange rates to make this claim, right? Because I doubt that would be true in the black market (i.e. free market) exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:42:56
Cognitive dissonance is fascinating.
One could also argue that BTC dropping to zero would also be healthy, as people should stop investing in something of negative value.
