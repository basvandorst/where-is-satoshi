Wow, after seeing all the praise that's being heaped on them in this thread I might just buy a few to support them. I love the vision behind the project and I believe in supporting their vision. Anywhere I can read up on them? I'd love to see what else they have going on.

I've seen the analogy of a piggy bank. You can add money to it and check the balance by plugging it in to any computer with the software. Then you physically hand it off to make payment. If you want to add those funds to your primary wallet however, you must physically break the circuit with the pin. Then the private key will be exposed to the computer and you can transfer your coin.

Wait, really? I had been lurking and posting a few times on the sub casually for a couple years and never saw a mention.
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:12:01
You're likely correct, thanks for letting me know.

Is OpenDime not open source? I assumed it was based on the name. It seems a bit disingenuous to have open in the name if it's not.

Ah that makes sense, it seems like a fantastic product. I was surprised I didn't hear about it sooner. I've been casually watching bitcoin since it was 200$, (if only...). But I've been more actively watching for the past year or two.
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:53:13
You got it. I totally agree, I mentioned above I wish it was closer to 5$ a pop. It just doesn't make sense for regular use.
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:16:21
That's a really interesting line of thought. It definitely makes sense.

This is very cool stuff. I think I am going to buy some bitcoins or at least parts of some. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:34:16
When I can dedicate some time into this (aka tomorrow) I will do some looking around on these links. Sadly it's 11:30 PM and it must wait another day.

200 bits  
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:17:05
Thank you that's very generous. What can you use these for? I plan on tipping other people, but could you use it as currency. I have been following bitcoins for a while but never owned any. Could I go online and buy one dollar worth of something on say Amazon (I think they accept them right?)?
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:17:24
That's generous of you!
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:38:15
 good job op
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:18:26
This is really cool thank you for replying!
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:38:12
Very, it would be a great service. I imagine that it would be wildly successful if done well.
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:04:04
Pretty sure it's like coinmap and I believe it's outdated as shit.

I actually own a ledger, but I've never heard anyone strongly favor Ledger over Trezor. Can I ask why?
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:27:13
Thanks for letting me know. I don't really do altcoins, but it's good to consider.
@_date: 2019-02-26 04:19:16
No one has acknowledged you directly yet, but that's really cool. I can imagine accepting bitcoin is difficult for you as billing for you is a bit more complex than a gas station. Keep it up! 
@_date: 2015-03-04 12:18:35
Been a while since someone has done this!

I'm looking into a lightning node, that pi post 
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:48:33
I completely understand that. I expect the money I enter to be lost, as a rule, and you are off on your age guess. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:51:35
I'm having a hard time following what you're actually saying in that post. For example what is stick? 
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:08:47
I understand that. I was younger, it was almost 6 years ago now. I'm a bit older and more independent now. But I've done ample research over the last six years and have been waiting for an opportunity like this to get in.

When you say desktop wallet is it more browser accessible or is it base on the computer itself. I'm currently in college and while unlikely(knock on wood) laptops do get stolen and I'd prefer to have it on something retrievable.

So basically is there just not as much malware attack the Linux distros? What do you mean secure my machine, I have 2FA and a strong password. I also have a yubikey but I didn't see how to use it with Electrum, I'd love to use the yubikey. Your phrasing feels like you are saying anti-virus software, but that isn't usually that great at protecting your machine.

Alright, I'm officially in as of now. I now own some amount of btc. But rule 1 is never tell how much, right? 
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:11:25
What do you think about the guy below saying I'll get robbed to my last penny because I'm on a windows laptop? Seems awfully exaggerated and fear mongerish. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:52:44
That analogy is exactly what I needed to see. I've always thought that first I wanted to understand more. Often the best way to learn is to do. I completely agree, and my outlook is that what I put in is gone. Similar to poker, anything I get back is a bonus. What are your thoughts on buying through an exchange with a debit card. Feels like it could ruin any anonymity.
Also see my other comment, absolutely no ill will is being held towards him.

I'll defend him here a bit, hes a really smart man and a great dad. Missed the mark on this one, but it's life. He's more on board with bitcoin now. Coulda paid for a year of college tho
