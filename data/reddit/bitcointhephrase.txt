No one replies to ads on there. Had so many flakes and the ones that do reply are asking for prices that make them $150 on a 5 BTC transaction(Way to much IMHO for a 15 min meeting). The prices on LBC are based on what drug addicts are will to pay for some BTC, that's my thought anyway.

A discussion can happen more than once, but you didn't even bother to use the search function or do anything constructive besides sharing an unoriginal thought. There are 145,000 users on so shower thoughts from unqualified individuals just lowers the overall quality of posts in the subreddit.

I don't believe that the issues relating to anonymity can't be overcome. Yes, it is possible to track bitcoins to an extent, but it is also very possible to move and spend bitcoins in a way that they never actually track back to you. 
I too have my concerns about "Satoshi", but so far I haven't seen anything credible to be be concerned about in regards to the technical aspects of Bitcoin.

You don't know what you're talking about, as there were a handful of papers discussing very similar concepts years before bitcoin. A lot of work and forethought went into bitcoin, but it was definitely an amalgamation of many ideas from years of research and discussion.

But if you lose the other one, wouldn't you feel insecure knowing your private key is still on the other device? 
That seems like a really poor choice in regards to the security of your funds. 
I think you could accomplish the same thing by keeping a fresh Trezor2 set up with its own unique wallet, along with a paper back up of Trezor1. If Trezor1 is lost, you can sweep the funds from the paper back to Trezor2 and it'll be ready to go.

It's true those operating systems have *nix-based origins, but Linux as a standalone OS is what I was referring to. That Android and OSX were able to become so mainstream is no doubt the result of making it easier for the average user to use, and Bitcoin should learn from that narrative.  Personally, I'd be ecstatic if Bitcoin found a strong niche userbase of 1-2% like Linux, but I think a lot of people would view that as falling short of its potential.

Have you looked at the original bitcoin code versus what it is today? I had similar thoughts that bitcoin would eventually be replaced, but after a lot of research I'm convinced that bitcoin itself can address a lot of its shortcomings at the core level. A huge part of Bitcoin's success will also depend on security, and a strong, time-tested network will be an important of that. I've yet to see any meaningful alt-coin that offers something bitcoin couldn't implement if it truly were the better way of doing things.

Considering the ETF is just going to hold BTC, why not just buy BTC instead of paying someone to mange an ETF that holds BTC? These clowns catch a lot of flack because they're morons, they're trying to become middle men here. It's not a scam, but just another unnecessary, centralized investment fund. The ongoing costs of simply holding BTC is very low, but I'll bet they'll still be collecting a nice yearly management fee for doing almost nothing.

Well for one, quit acting like an ignorant child when the price of your BTC doesn't get pumped on news that a large company is accepting BTC. This is a good sign that individual users and merchants don't have a large impact on the underlying price. 
I'm a fan of bitcoin and the technology, but step out of this bubble that is and you'll see that we're still a long way from bitcoin being adopted en mass by any demographic. 
Just sit tight, or you know, sell your bitcoin and shut the fuck up. 
You problem is that you're naive and you have little understanding of how markets work. Do a little research and educate yourself before coming on the internet and whining about how a technology and a market you clearly don't understand is not doing what you want it to.

Not knowing if or when a huge amount of bitcoins will ever hit the market does make it difficult to accurately value bitcoin though. There may be 21 million coins total, but knowing how many are actually under someone's control is what I want to know. We know that there will never actually be 21 million coins available for sale, but it'd be nice to know just how close to that number we are.

You should feel safer with offline storage more so than anything else. If you're worried about your house burning down, keep a backup in a safe deposit box in a bank. There are ways to encrypt a paper wallet too, using BIP38 encryption, so if you knew the bank was robbed, you could probably clear those BTC into a new wallet before the robber had a chance to decrypt the wallet. You would have to remember the password, but for backup purposes, you could use something easy to remember like your name+social security number+date of birth+mother's maiden name. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 07:16:39
I feel much the same way. The fact that the Winkletwats are speaking for bitcoin makes me nervous. They're so clearly not the forward thinking type. All they want to do is list a bitcoin ETF. That is so unrevolutionary that I can't believe anyone on this subreddit gives shit about it. Once they get that out of the way, maybe they can help me send faxes with Bitcoin…and maybe someday we can even use Bitcoin at  pay phones instead of needing quarters. Thank goodness these geniuses are out there innovating.

Your comment echoes many of my thoughts on Bitcoin. I've made similar connections to Unix/Linux in the past and it's that example that makes me rethink how far Bitcoin will realistically go. The best technology isn't always the one that is technically best; Bitcoin could easily spend the next 20 years as a niche currency with very little mass market adoption. While that would disappoint me a bit, I wouldn't be at all surprised.

Quite a leap to come to that conclusion. You're no different than the idiots who play lotto and spend their nights dreaming about what they'd do if they won. How about instead of asking what people will do with all their BTC when its value increases, you instead talk about actual entrepreneurial ventures you could undertake to help take BTC to the moon; otherwise, like I said, you're just like all the idiots playing lotto. Do you not get that? Just talking about what you're going to do with all your BTC is a circle jerk and it just highlights the fact that you have nothing to offer the bitcoin world other than a desire to strike it rich on the backs of those working to do something truly entrepreneurial.

Search for a tutorial on setting up offline or paper wallets. There are plenty of good resources here on reddit and bitcointalk. 
I used a cheap printer without any internal memory. The cheapest thing you can find should work, and if you really want to do it right, break the printer into pieces and toss it in the trash after you're done. I also used a cheap, old computer that had been freshly wiped and would never connect to the internet again. I destroyed the RAM and HD afterwards and disposed of the rest in pieces. 
You may decide this is overkill, but to sleep soundly at night, I had to think in uber-paranoid mode. Basically, I was left with a bunch of BIP38 encrypted paper wallets which I laminated and store in a safe place. I copied all the public addresses to an internet connected computer so I can view my balances and send money to those wallets, but no privates keys to my reserves exist on any internet connected device.

Reddcoin is the fastest growing crypto-currencies next to Bitcoin.  It aims to implement itself with  social media websites for main stream popularity.  It is the perfect time to buy Reddcoin now because of how new it is and how low the price is.  Think about buying Bitcoin at $2.99 for 5000 just before the price shot up to $300 per coin and then later $800 per coin.




That is exactly the kind of site that's going to get crypto currency into trouble with regulators. That's why we have so many regulations in the US as it is, because of people like this trying to take advantage of the uninformed and the naive.

A Bitcoin is not a company, that really doesn't take much of an argument. 
You yourself even called it a product, so would you call the iPhone a company? Or is it a product offered by a company(Apple)? 
Bitcoin is a protocol which any company or individual can use or modify, but it isn't a company by itself. The only thing that will affect its price in the long term is whether or not the price facilitates the daily needs of it's users.

Obviously coins mined before a certain date can be presumed to be Satoshi's, but it's not known how long he continued mining after the network grew, and furthermore, it's not hard to mine anonymously. You really think you can identity the majority of the coins owned by the guy who invented the protocol? We know of a specific number of coins that are likely under his control, but that is likely a low-end estimation.

If you were their lawyer, they'd be in even worse shape. Capitalizing has squat to do with anything. Moreover, Apple's trademark has zero relevance here.

You can't pick generic names that are already in use within a field and then tell other people it's now your word and only you can use it. They could call themselves Blockchain and sell coffee, that would be fine, but they can't operate within the Bitcoin space and claim Blockchain as a word only they can use.

There are valid complaints regarding BTC, but most often it's because people expect it to be like PayPal or a credit card, when it should be thought of as cash. It's not meant to be a stand alone product 100% of the time and will require insurance and escrow services for some people to feel safe using it. Bitcoin still has a way to go before it is useful to everyone and all situations, but at the core it is a sold piece of technology which has the potential to evolve and address each of its shortcomings.

The blockchain is related directly to the decentralized bitcoin protocol and network, it is not controlled by any one company.

I'm sincerely glad to hear you say that, because it seems like anyone who really understands what bitcoin is can appreciate how excited I am for the technology to go mainstream. I keep trying to talk myself out of bitcoin, but unlike other technologies that have excited me, the more I learn about bitcoin, the more I believe in it. What both excites and scares me is the likelihood that no one really knows just what bitcoin and blockchain technology will be capable of and what role they will play in the years to come. There are a lot of great theoretical concepts for bitcoin, but I can't wait to see how those ideas mature and how new ideas will spawn that we can't even fathom today.
I'm considering using bitcoin for the bulk of my finances too, so it's nice to hear that others are doing the same. Assuming bitcoin isn't compromised at the core level, I don't think bitcoin will ever hit $0 in our lifetimes, so I think we'll be okay.

There is no need for them to be an invoicing service too, that is something that can be provided without needing your payees to sign up for any additional service.

I think you can hold Bitcoin and also spend it; the two aren't mutually exclusive. I am fine having a few hundred BTC stashed away for the long term while still spending 1-2 BTC a month.

Whichever option you choose to use on your phone, I recommend treating that wallet like you would treat a traditional wallet you keep in your pocket. You don't walk around with hundreds or thousands of dollars in your wallet, and you certainly don't take your life savings with you everywhere you go. Use offline wallets to store the bulk of your Bitcoin, and only carry around what you think you need or would be comfortable losing. At this stage, Bitcoin companies are still learning how to handle Bitcoin securely, so don't put all your eggs in any one basket.

The concept is the closest thing to an unbiased global ledger as we have. That is a fascinating accomplishment which will have long lasting implications.

I feel you on that one. I took my time getting everything consolidated, and I could have easily been in your shoes before I got smart about storing my coins offline. 
I now have 3 levels of storage/wallets:
Offline: Bulk of my coins
On Computer: What I need for spending in a month.
On my phone: What I need in the next day or two.
This way I only need to add what I will use, I just create bulk, BIP38 protected paper wallets in various 1-5 BTC increments so I only need to load in one wallet at time. Works great and I feel very safe that what is offline is under my control only. I do my best to protect what's on my phone or laptop, but I think of those coins as cash in my tradition leather wallet.

If he went into it with a long term outlook, then he would be foolish to get out before his investment has really had time to mature. If that was money meant for something important in the near term, then yeah, he should get out now while he still can. But a lot of people holding bitcoin are doing so because they see a lot of potential in the technology; considering the technology isn't even out of beta yet, it would be jumping the gun to get out of bitcoin so early. It's highly unlikely bitcoin would go to $0 overnight unless the integrity of the network were compromised.

That'd be like losing your debit card and just getting a new one without canceling the old one.

I don't see why you think that. You can buy a prepaid Visa for that amount without any problems. Based on everything that I've read and lived so far, I don't think the US will try to stop small &lt;$1,000 BTC transactions. It is easy to deal in cash under $1k, so the market will exist whether legitimately or not. I think the US would rather go with lax regulation, so that it stays legitimate and monitorable. The people who will follow what the government says probably aren't doing anything illegal anyway, so they'd just be regulating a group of people who were never a threat.

Are you retarded? How do you make the leap to BTC will never be acceptable for sending funds over seas? Because it isn't here only 5-6 years after the technology came out and is still in very rough stages of 3rd party development? Just because your situation didn't necessitate BTC doesn't mean it's useless, it means you don't understand when it should be used. You're only paying $50 to wire him funds internationally in the same denomination, that's not a bad price at all. In this case a traditional wire looks like the better deal. Now try sending a $100 wire or a USD to EUR and see how much you like that $25 dollar fee on each end + exchange fees. Not so cheap now, is it?

Just incredible that such a large exchange was operated so poorly.

Perhaps I misunderstood the point the previous poster was trying to make, because that is my point, Bitcoin has been trickling down, and there's not reason to think it can't sit under $300 indefinitely.

We could argue about how best to say it, but the result would be about the same.

That's great that people have ideas, but unless you're going to do something about it, then shut the fuck up, because everyone has at least one good idea. I've been around long enough to know that ideas don't mean shit unless someone's willing to put forth some effort and real time into making it a reality.

I'm oversimplifying for the sake of not talking over anyone's head. You seem to think that how these crimes are prosecuted is somehow limiting how they can and how they should be prosecuted. Decisions were made to not prosecute; not because there isn't enough evidence, but because it would be bad business. Within the current system, there was a lot more they could have done, and you can't tell me that these people were so damn good that they can't find a single person to hold accountable at any level. 
If I was selling drugs or running a fraudulent investment fund, and I was busted, do you think I'd get to keep all my illicit gains? Do you think my family would get to keep the house I bought them? 
Crimes were committed and it shouldn't be hard to see who benefited considering these businesses are supposed to keep detailed accounting records.

I was agreeing with you, my point is that even though there are "plenty of scenarios where bitcoin doesn't work," it is not a permanent issue most of the time. The functionality of bitcoin evolves as more people write new code. People who try bitcoin now and don't like it are probably not very tech savvy and in my opinion they shouldn't be playing around with bitcoin just yet. Another couple years and the seemingly complicated backend of bitcoin won't be something the average users needs to worry about.

I guess that is somewhat of an advantage, being able to recover funds, but that's an awful lot of power for a government, business, or individual to have, and as we've seen in the past, that power can and will be abused.

If I was a customer of Bitstamp, I would be removing my deposits as quickly as possible. I sincerely hope Bitstamp passes all solvency checks, but anyone who is keeping money in Bitstamp right now is taking unnecessary risk and ignoring many of the same warnings signs as Mt.

Not just liquidity, but dispersement and a larger user base is what will stabilize the market. Right now, there are still a lot of miners, holders, and hackers from the early days with a large percentage of the outstanding BTC, and when those players decide to cash out, the market can't handle that many coins at once, so the price plummets. When daily volume is to the point that even the largest wallet could be dumped at market price, then we'll be able to take the next step towards stability. When we go from hundreds of thousands of users to hundreds of millions, the tolerance for risk and need the need to liquidate won't be as homogeneous. When will this happen? Who knows, maybe never...

Bitcoin is designed to be as neutral and unpolitical as possible. Rejecting a political ideology is not really a political ideology in itself. Someone who owns a bitcoin can do so for any number of reasons, many of which may conflict with the reasons of another user. But the blockchain does not differentiate between their bitcoins. Bitcoin.org is not Bitcoin, so even though you can overlay an abstract political layer over certain subsets of the user base, that doesn't change the underlying code, which can't differentiate between a Girl Scout group and a Fortune 500 company. Most bitcoin isn't held at government regulated banks either; don't know where you got that idea from.

That is not true. A company does not need your permission to buy information on you. Depending what decisions will be made based on that info may require certain permissions and disclosures, but there are a lot of gray areas which haven't been fully addresses yet.

The shareholders often times had no knowledge, I agree with that, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't suffer some loss on their investment. No shareholder should be in jail, but that doesn't mean they should profit from the wrong doings of others. And I disagree that it's too complicated to hold someone accountable. The scale of the crimes required explicit actions on the part of many people within the company. Start treating the executives like the captain of a ship; if they signed off on something illegal, then they should go down with the ship. I also disagree that bankrupting a bank is a bad thing. As long as there are competing banks, there will be buyers for that bankrupt businesses assets. It's certainly more complicated than that, but that is where actual regulation and rules can be effective, by ensuring protections for the shareholders and the consumers who aren't complicit. There is no excuse for coddling businesses who don't follow the rules. If they're too big to hold accountable, then they're too big and need to be dismantled.

Bullshit. You are naive as fuck if you think a password and a PIN are going to keep your funds safe when someone decides to jump you for it. People have PINs on their debit cards too, but when you get mugged and have a gun pointed in your face, what good does a PIN do? A Trezor would be even more insecure because it doesn't have limits like an ATM card, and funds could be stolen on the spot using a cell phone. Walking around with the ability to drain your cold storage from anywhere is asking for trouble.

What if I overheard you telling someone else how to secure the device with two passwords? What if that becomes common practice? If the first password you gave me only has a few bits in it, I may get pissed and suspect you're holding out on me. 
I am not saying this is or would be common, but it would happen, I'm certain of it. Not having direct access to the private keys in the first place is the safest and most secure way to ensure you're not wiped out in an instant. 
Surely there are clever ways of programming the funds with time delays, limits, multisig, etc., but none of those would be as secure as just not keeping the private keys on your person at all. Who needs or wants the ability to drain their entire savings from any location within seconds? In the real world, how often are you going to need to transfer massive amounts of bitcoin with no warning or ability to access them from a secure location? I've been in finance for over a decade now, and I don't think I've ever come across a situation where someone needed their entire life savings in under 30 minutes. 
Some people may not have a secure location, and for those people, maybe this is the only viable solution, but if you don't need to carry around your life savings, why would you? With all the great security features Bitcoin offers, why trust only a password to keep your funds safe?

I think it will be great for the older crowd who still don't have smartphones. There is a huge technical gap that makes bitcoin very intimidating to those people.

Historically, buying on highs is a good strategy. Buy an asset as it's going up setting new highs, and it will probably continue going up setting new highs ; buy an asset while it's going down setting new lows, and it will likely continue to go down setting new lows.

It wouldn't be hard for Bitstamp to see where the money went even if the hacker used multiple addresses, and it wouldn't be hard for the hacker to spread the funds back out at a later date.

To some extent, yes, but a lot of the data they aggregate is public information or information owned by a company, not an individual.

The bullshit financial claims are the ones that need debunking the most, as it's the promise of financial gain that is motivating the "investors". The simplest way to put an end to this nonsense, in my opinion, is to expose the deception and provably false financial claims that have been made, making it clear to the non-technical investor why this is a scam and why they will lose money.

To be more specific, I think the answers we need are related to financial transparency. Ponzi schemes work because people just trust what they're told, but if you study past financial crimes, you can quickly see that most of them would have been prevented if there was more transparency of the company's financials. Madoff would've been busted way sooner if the SEC and investors would've demanded to see that his actual accounts matched the statements he was sending out.

It's not irrelevant. There is a limit to the influence the futures market can have over the actual price of a bitcoin. The futures market can't force a buyer or a seller to make a trade; only the buyers and sellers on an exchange have a direct effect on the price of a bitcoin. The futures market is but one of many factors that buyers and sellers consider when making a trade, but if they disagree with the sentiment of the futures market, then the price will contradict what the futures market predicts. You're conflating correlation with causation.

Those are indirect causes. How can you not understand the difference between direct and indirect? The futures market is a secondary market and is not a part of the exchange market. Yes, they may affect the price, but the direct cause is someone selling as a result of the increase negative or positive sentiment. It takes a buyer or a seller to react to those secondary markets before the price is directly affected. Do you still not understand? You are trying to argue based on the fact that people react to what happens on the futures market, but that does not mean the futures market has direct influence over the market price.

You're starting to sound like a crazy person. I am not telling you I am omniscient, and I am not asking you to take my word for it, I have presented you with facts. 
Certainly other countries can stand up to the US, but not without consequences, that is the point, a point that just about everyone but you seems to be understanding. Sure, the Isle of Man could stand up for one business, but what about when the US then embargoes the Isle of Man for harboring businesses that the US feels are detrimental to US law and its citizens? What if they choose to embargo any other country that does business with the Isle of Man? Why don't you ask Cuba how hard it is to have a thriving economy when you're embargoed by the US. I'm not arguing that it's okay for the US to have the power they do, but they have the power and you can't pretend otherwise. You're absolutely right that there are countries that don't have to listen to the US, but then they may also have to deal with losing customers in any other country that values the US over the Isle of Man, which is just about everyone.

We've gone from Mt. Gox handling 99% of trades, to now having dozens of exchanges, along with futures contracts and the ability to short bitcoin. The hash rate of the network is 40,000x as powerful and we've gone from needing to download the entire blockchain and run a wallet on the desktop, to having dozens of choices for wallets we can use directly from our phones. We can now easily secure our coin using multisig and hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger, with a handful of other options on the way. We've gone from being able to buy primarily drugs to being able to buy directly from Dell, Microsoft, Newegg, and a hundred thousand other merchants including brick and mortar stores. You can now get your paycheck in Bitcoin and travel all over the world purchasing your hotel and airfare with Bitcoin. Even better, people are starting to use Bitcoin as the backbone for international remittances.

I don't think you should feel entitled to participate in running a node unless you can meet certain performance standards. Some people have even slower connections than 1Mbps, so why don't we cater the Bitcoin protocol to work with a 56k modem? Not catering to the slowest participants does not automatically mean that everyone needs a data center connection either. As long as a strong enough majority can participate, that should be enough. The protocol being decentralized doesn't mean that it needs to be capable of running on every machine and over every connection! 
You're laying out a ridiculously convoluted alternative that is not realistic at all for a global platform. If someone needs to send $500, telling them to break it up into 50 different transactions is not going to fly. That is horrible from a records keeping standpoint and defeats the purpose of using an open ledger. 
That is so much more overhead with no real justification other than needing to meet the needs of someone with a shitty connection. That is ridiculous. You can still use the network, and it would still be decentralized, you just wouldn't be able to run a node. Plenty of people would be able to though, and that would be enough. 
It seems like you're just in denial about what needs to happen because you want to be able to run a full node on your shitty connection, but by limiting the block size to such an arbitrarily low figure, you're hurting Bitcoin more than you're helping it. 
It would make so much more sense to allow as many transactions as the network could handle over an average connection, which is currently about 5x your connection speed, and then if someone like you wanted to run a node or your own gateway, you could do so on a side chain, using your hub protocol, or whatever it is you settle on. But saying that everyone else has to be limited by your technical limitations is absurd.

I've read it, but I am under the impression that those payment channels were designed for micropayments so as to avoid bloat and excessive fees for small transactions. I don't think I would want that to be my primary means of transferring bitcoin. A majority of connections have enough bandwidth to support a higher block size limit too, so if the issue is bandwidth, the 1MB still isn't justified. That is a reason not to remove the limit completely, but it doesn't support keeping it at the arbitrary limit that is currently set.

I have a degree in economics and have been in the financial sector for 20 years, I understand what I am talking about. It's sad that you can't recognize when you're wrong and instead want to pretend like this is about semantics. You've already admitted that the futures market affects sentiment, and that sentiment can affect price, but by admitting that, you're acknowledging that the futures market doesn't have a direct influence over price, only sentiment of some market participants. If you can't understand the discrepancy, then you're the one who is hopeless.

Maybe you're missing the point:
The US has influence over any country they want when it comes down to it; if they ignore you, it's only because you're not a significant enough problem to warrant intervention. 
You asked why people try to work within US regulations and you've been given a very clear case of why. 
You suggested a company could set up in the Isle of Man or another sheltering jurisdiction, but that didn't help Poker Stars, which was owned by Israelis, not Americans. So quit ignoring the facts. If the US can shut down a casino owned by Israelis and incorporated in the Isle of Man, then what makes you think they wouldn't do they same to a Bitcoin related business if it were considered a big enough threat to US law and businesses? 
You can't keep pretending like this didn't happen. Why would Pokerstars settle with the US and spend hundreds of millions to settle with the US if the US didn't have any influence? 
This is about as good of an example as you can get and you're completely denying it's relevance.

It's a work in progress. You're putting the cart before the horse by complaining about there only being a few purchases. Not a lot of people have bitcoin, so it's moronic to currently expect huge volume as a merchant. But without merchant acceptance, no one would have much incentive to obtain bitcoin. You've got a shitty attitude, and maybe it's just because you're bitter about losing money or something, but that caveat has been there from the beginning. Yes we hype Bitcoin up, but that is because it is exciting to a lot of us who "get it". We are so limited in what we're allowed to do based on who we're allowed to do business with, and that has severely handicapped the potential of not just Bitcoin, but the entire internet. Bitcoin is the equalizer. It doesn't matter what country you're in, or what your background is, if you have a service or a product to offer the world, you can accept Bitcoin without needing permission from any damn bank or government. It's curing the cancer that is government corruption and corporate greed.

We're in a lull between demand and new coin creation. The halving won't solve all our problems, but a combination of increased demand and decreased supply of new coins should ease a lot of this pressure. We're going through Bitcoin puberty right now. A lot is happening behind the scenes and by the end of the year we should have some really great developments which attract new users, but until then, it's going to be a bumpy ride. Nothing has really changed from a technical perspective, and in my opinion, Bitcoin looks stronger everyday. Keep your head up, brighter days are ahead.

Exactly. Imagine if we kept the currently regulated stock market and financial system, but added in the ability for people to directly control their securities and finances if they choose to, with no ability for the government to seize your holdings. That is sort of how I view this. We're going to have regulation, which is going to allow big businesses to legally offer many of the same services they do today, as well as many new ones, but no matter what, the individual will still be able to take control of his or her own bitcoin if they choose. Bitcoin is all about having options, and ironically, regulation actually affords us more options. I'm not happy with everything that appears to be coming in the BitLicense, but a framework for large scale businesses is a good thing.

You can check the "days destroyed" to see if older bitcoin are being moved, which would support your hypothesis, but looking at those charts, it doesn't seem to support what you're suggesting. Most older coins still haven't moved; either they're lost or being hoarded. The more likely scenario is a simple one: bitcoin mining is producing more coins than the market can support based on current interest and willingness to buy into the market. Fortunately, we're only a year away from the halving, which should ease this selling pressure. Miners have real expenses to cover, so they will be selling coins to cover their electricity and maintenance costs. This is a good thing though, as it keeps coins circulating and makes it hard for miners to obtain too large a stake in Bitcoin.

The exchanges are just middlemen, they take a cut of the interest that the person shorting the coins is paying to the person lending the coins. The exchange also collects fees on a per trade basis, so more people trading is actually more profitable. 
Let's assume we have Bob, Alice, and the exchange. 
Bob has 100 BTC
Alice has 0 BTC  (In real life Alice will need to put up some sort of collateral, either a % in BTC or USD to show that she is capable of paying back Bob his BTC even if her bet is wrong.)
Let's assume Bob is optimistic about Bitcoin, and wants to make some more bitcoin by lending his coins out to someone else for a fee. 
Alice thinks Bitcoin is going down, so she borrows Bob's bitcoin and sells them on the exchange. Let's further assume that at the time Alice sold Bob's coins, the price was at $100. 
Now Alice has sold 100 BTC and so has a short position of 100 BTC. She will pay Bob .1BTC a day until she returns his coins; this is Bob's fee. 
Now if the price goes down to $80, Alice can buy the 100 BTC back, return them to Bob, and pocket the $20 per coin as her profit, minus the fee she's paid to Bob. 
If the price goes up to $120, Alice has to spend more money to buy those coins back and loses $20 per coin + the fee to Bob. 
When Alice is done, whether she's made money or lost money, Bob will have made more bitcoin than he originally lent to Alice (100BTC + his .1BTC per day fee)
The exchange is neutral in this situation and only works to ensure that Alice can afford to return the BTC back to Bob regardless of what the price does.

Inviting a woman for the sake of inviting a woman is the opposite of equality. When there is a qualified female to invite to such an event, I hope she'd be invited, but don't invite anyone who doesn't deserve it.  Setting quotas and requirements for including women and minorities is a joke, and it's the only reason I won't opt for a black doctor. Black people are allowed into medical school with lower qualifications than any other race, because the medical schools want to meet quotas. I'd rather have no quotas and no black doctors unless they were as qualified as the rest of the students. I have nothing against black people in general, but because of these policies I have a prejudice against black doctors. If there were no quota like this, I'd have no problem being treated by a black doctor because I'd know they had to meet every requirement that the other doctors did.

Not every payment needs to hit the blockchain, I agree. But the network does need to be able to handle more than 5-10 transactions per second. That is only about a tenth of what PayPal can handle and one ten thousandth of what Visa can handle. Bitcoin is supposed to be a global payment network, but that will not happen if you can only settle 5-10 transactions per second. If your plan is to just do everything off-chain, then you're forgoing the purpose of the blockchain. Microtransactions can be conducted off-chain, sure, but do you really think that works for every situation? Allowing centralized services to take over a majority of Bitcoin transactions is a recipe for disaster. 
It's also possible to run a node without storing the entire blockchain. So the argument that you won't be able to run a node is bunk. Storage capacity will likely outpace the blockchain growth anyway, so it is only a matter of time before you can easily afford to store the entire blockchain. If you're okay with running everything on side chains, then why wouldn't you be okay with running an optimized node? You don't need to have decades worth of transactions on your personal node. Why should we handicap the whole network because you currently have slow internet? That seems like such a backwards approach considering enough people can meet the minimum standards without compromising the integrity of the network. 
Imagine if all technology had to cater to the lowest common denominator; we'd stagnate. 
Your argument seems to be that we should make it so only a limited number of people can actually use the blockchain in favor of making it possible for everyone to participate in running the network. Do you really think that is a good idea? Why would someone run a node for a network they can't use? I'd rather be able to transact normally as I do now without having to worry about whether Bob in Iowa has a fast enough connection or a big enough hard drive. We should aim for a network that is decentralized and accessible to as many people as possible, but by limiting the block size to only 1MB, you're doing the opposite.

You can short at any price. So if there are coins available, you will be able to short them. 
Short selling quit simple; the person shorting coins is borrowing them from someone else and then selling the coins, with a promise to return those coins at a later date. Until the short returns the coins, they usually pay interest to the person they borrowed the coins from.

I think I understand the idea just fine, but it doesn't appear as though it's entirely without risk and requires a lot more cooperation than just sending a payment to an address and waiting for it to confirm. And even the paper admits that the maximum block size needs to be increased.  
It also goes on to say that payments need to be broken down into micro payments to avoid collusion and theft. 
If I am sending a large payment, I wouldn't want to use that method. It looks great for micro payments, and that seems to be what it is primarily designed for. For large payments though, I can't see many people preferring that to traditional on-chain payments that will be confirmed within the hour. 
So what is the point? If I am going to send or receive a payment that I want to clear as soon as possible, there seems to be no reason why I'd prefer this over a transaction between just me and the counterpart directly on-chain.

This was a public auction run by the US government. If the buyers wanted privacy, they could have purchased their bitcoin from another source instead. The buyer may have a right to privacy, but how do you figure the US government has a right to withhold from the public the amount it sold the coins for? Tim Draper revealed himself as the winner, and as far as I know, he wouldn't be known as the winner if he didn't reveal that information. So the price paid for the coins should be public information, the only reason it is compromising the privacy of the buyer is because the buyer revealed himself.

You don't know what you're talking about. It would be more expensive to transact in a game using bitcoins versus an in-game currency. You're still going to have a middle man because many games are running proprietary software and likely would be taking a percentage of sales and transactions anyway. If the software is unreliable, you're not going to be able to play; so what does it matter if the blockchain is up, but the game server is down? The flawed incentive model is a choice by the game developer and is not directly related to the fact that the in-game currency is a centralized service. Again, more nonsense that shows you don't know what you're talking about. 
A game could run it's own decentralized alt-coin or sidechain and that would be cheaper and overall more efficient than using bitcoins directly, especially in a game that deals with microtransactions. You can disagree and pretend like you know what you're talking about, but you'd be wrong. It's not matter of opinion when facts are involved.

How would it be cheaper and more efficient? I think you have that backwards. An in-game currency doesn't need a massive decentralized network to process transactions like Bitcoin does, so it would make more sense to use an in-game currency that is centralized, but with the ability to cashout into BTC. As long as the amounts were small enough, and the system secure enough, there's no good reason for bloating the blockchain with that kind of nonsense. This is exactly the kind of use case that calls for a sidechain or an alt-coin.

Holy fuck, you have absolutely no clue what you are talking about. Do you even know what the word dilution means? The amount of bitcoin each share represents does not change. There would be more shares, and each share would comprise a smaller percentage of the overall fund, but what each share represents stays the same. The only thing that matters here is what is backing each share, i.e., 1/10th of a bitcoin; when a new share is issued, that does not dilute existing shareholder value.
Go fucking google this shit because you are making absolutely no sense, and the fact you still can't comprehend this is astounding. You are wrong here, and you need to go do some real research. Please. No matter how many times you try to repeat the same bullshit about dilution, it's not going to change the fact that you are dead wrong. 
You must be thinking of this as equity in a company wherein the issuance of additional shares would dilute the value of the preexisting shares, but that is not how an open-ended fund works here. New share issuance in an open-ended fund would be more comparable to a stock split.

The point is to get an accurate number, not to do pointless exercises that don't answer the OP's question. 
You're ignoring obvious outliers that don't accurately represent the average poster, which is what the OP was asking about. 
If we had 100,000 users here, all with a net worth of $100,000, the average net worth of an poster would be $100,000. But if Bill Gates showed up, that would mean the average user is now worth $600,000. Does that make sense to you to say that the average user is worth $600,000 when 99.9% of users are only worth $100,000? That would be ridiculous. If you eliminate the non-average users, you can get a more accurate idea of what the average user is worth.

Even if it went up to 20k a coin, there isn't much I want or need right now, so if it reached that point, I would be fine only spending what I need to afford the modest lifestyle I want. I would certainly divest to some extent, but reaching that kind of price point would likely mean Bitcoin has reached a new level of stability, and so the risk of holding the coins would be much less. At that valuation, I would probably be looking to invest in related companies that could offer me a lifetime income in bitcoin, but I wouldn't be dumping on the open market. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 10:33:47
Why would you invest in a volatile asset when you had short term needs for the money? That's just dumb. If you would've done your homework, you'd never have made such a foolish decision. Bitcoin has long term potential, but expecting short term stability at this stage of the game was naive. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:15:47
Your numbers don't make sense anyway you spin it. 75% of the current coins are controlled by around 1,500 wallets, so we can eliminate 75% of current bitcoins from what the average user here could be holding. So that's 3,500,000 million coins left. There are less than 100,000 wallets that have more than 10 BTC, and it's very unlikely that each of those wallets belongs to a unique user. So there are maybe 20,000-50,000 users in existence with between 10-100 bitcoin. With those numbers, there's no way we have an average holding of 30-60 BTC.

Bullshit. I am not asking you to jump to conclusions, and that is not the argument I am making. Don't try to make it about that.
You helped to defraud potential investors by running ads and giving legitimacy to a fraudulent enterprise. You continued to do so even after many concerns were being raised.
Like I said, you don't have to jump to conclusions and call out the fraud until you're sure, but continuing to run ads while so many red flags were present shows that you have no spine and valued the ad dollars over the integrity of your site. 
You say that you didn't have enough information until now, and that is nonsense. Maybe not enough for a public outing, but you should have been able to see something was fishy and at the very least stop running ads for this scam. 
If it took you this long to connect the dots, then no one should bother going to your site for news, because it's clearly run by spineless fools who don't know what investigative journalism looks like. Don't pretend you know how to examine facts either, because anyone looking at GAW objectively can see that the math just didn't work out and many of their claims could've been debunked with few phone calls.

How is the value of gold sustainable? If the price of gold increases, is that not wealth appearing out of nowhere under your line of thinking? The wealth is created by more people desiring the scare resource that is Bitcoin. It's not always going to be ridiculously deflationary where we're seeing double digit increases in value; in a more stabilized future, we would a expect to see only a small increase in the purchasing power of a bitcoin as the overall wealth and productivity of an economy increases.

Yes it is. If you spend a dollar now, you forego spending it on something else in the future. With high inflation, there is a negative correlation to value, so spending is encouraged, while in a defaltionary currency, savings correlate with more purchasing power in the future. So the opportunity cost of spending a dollar versus a bitcoin are inversely related. The decision to spend a dollar is foregoing less value in the future, while spending a bitcoin is foregoing an increase in future value. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:49:48
That is a naive line of thought. Because the way society is currently structured, it allows the very rich to hoard, while the middle classes have to consume. Saving is not the same as hoarding if you're savings towards something you can't afford at the present time. I can save gold until I have enough for a house, but that doesn't mean I plan to hoard the gold forever, only until I have enough to buy what I actually want. We still pay taxes on the money we earn, so we're paying our share to society, that doesn't mean we should be taxed again via inflation when we choose to not spend our post-tax dollars.

So they say...but when the new money isn't yet in the hands of the general public, it's hard to gauge the real effects of QE. With all the new money in the hands of the already rich, it's not like they're going to cause massive inflation. It would explain why the stock market is so overpriced though. If you give a whole bunch of rich people more money at near 0% interest, it would make sense that inflation shows itself in the stock market first. They're setting themselves up perfectly so that when the new money eventually trickles through the economy, they own even more of the businesses that people will be giving their money to.

Centralization of some services can be a positive thing. I have no problem with "bitcoin banks" being centralized and managing some people's funds, so long as the underlying protocol stays decentralized and allows me to choose whether I manage my assets directly or allow someone else to do it for me. There are already apps though that make it very easy to manage bitcoin without needed to trust a 3rd party with your private keys. 
The simplicity will come from centralized services that allow you to spend bitcoin instantly via trusted wallets. So people can keep the bulk of their funds on a device only they control and then load funds into a day-to-day wallet that works via multisig linked to a service that merchants and consumers can trust. This is the route Coinbase seems to be taking.

Now you're just arguing over what is considered the open market, which is not a set term. I consider the open market to be stocks that are currently for sale. I don't consider the car I drive to be on the open market until I put it up for sale. Your house isn't on the open market if you're not looking to move. There are different ways of creating new shares and a stock split where all existing shareholders are getting equal distribution of the shares is not the same as the company issuing new shares on the stock market where they can be purchased by anyone. The shares are issued to existing shareholders who can then take those shares and sell them on the open market, but the new shares aren't issued to the open market. You're skipping a step, and simply asking whether they can sell their new shares ignores the fact that they first have to put those shares on the open market; the issuing company does not do that. If stock splits, and someone who had 100 shares, now has 200 shares, they can take those additional shares and sell them on the open market, but that is no different than if they had sold 50 shares on the open market the day before the split. So listen to me closely: in a stock split, the existing shareholders stand between the open market and the company issuing new shares; shares are not issued on the open market.

That is a ridiculous estimate. No way at all that we have 150,000 people here with 30-60BTC. Anyone can subscribe to this subreddit, and not all those 150,000+ subscribers hold bitcoin. Moreover, 75% of the current bitcoins are controlled by less than 1,500 wallets. A more reasonable estimate is that the average holder here has between 1-10 BTC. I would also estimate that no more than half of the 150,000 subscribers here have ever purchased bitcoin.

The whole point of Bitcoin is that it's decentralized, so why are people sending all the funds to a middle man instead of that middle man acting only as an arbiter? It makes so much more sense to never give control of all the funds to an anonymous admin on a dark market when you could distribute that risk across all merchants on the site. You'll still have scams, but that much bitcoin disappearing would require the collusion of both the admins and all merchants on the site. 
I get that people still want their drugs, and I have no problem with the nature of the site, but given that they're almost completely anonymous, I would expect people to be a little smarter about how they go about making their purchases. 
The administrators of the these site should be earning their money through escrow fees and other fees, but if you give them control over all the funds, this is going to happen again and again.

I think an internal messaging system would be good, with the ability to reply from email via a relay similar to Amazon, which allows buyers and sellers to respond from email without revealing their email address while still logging the chat on the servers. It'd be nice if those chats could be encrypted and only revealed to an arbitrator or administrator if one of the parties agreed. That way everything is encrypted and only becomes viewable to 3rd parties in the case of a dispute. 


As someone who has sold stuff on various sites, I don't like that idea. I've had plenty of buyers who were unreasonable and had complaints related to things that are out of a sellers control, like shipping times, item malfunctioning after misuse, etc. I think something similar to eBay, how they only ding the seller for disputes that aren't resolved would nice. If there is an issue or a difficult buyer, I would like to be able resolve it first before making the issue public. Sometimes shit just happens, and that is a part of business; it's how a seller handles problems that should matter most, because all sellers will have problems with orders to some extent. As enough sellers start using a platform, it seems like you could gauge what is an acceptable percentage of problematic orders for various categories. eBay allows 2% before dinging the seller, and unresolved issues could be weighted differently. 
Maybe more transparency would be good though, but only if it goes both ways. On eBay, I have to cave to every demand a buyer makes, because negative feedback is a major detractor for my business and I'll do anything to maintain that 100% top rated status, but eBay only allows the seller to leave positive feedback for buyers, regardless of how difficult that buyer was. If a buyer has little reputation and receives negative feedback from multiple sellers, their feedback left for a seller should be negated or removed. Conversely, if a highly rated buyer leaves negative feedback, that is probably an accurate reflection of the transaction and should be left alone. 
An example of an issue I've had in the past:
I was selling some magnifying vanity mirrors from a very popular brand. I had sold a few dozen already and then I had a buyer who placed an order and received the same exact item I'd been shipping for weeks. All the other buyers had left positive feedback, item just as described, etc, but this buyer complained that it didn't match the description and didn't light up. I never said it lit up, it wasn't in the description that it lit up, but because the buyer assumed it lit up and wanted one that lit up, it became my fault for not shipping them something that I never even claimed to have. They threatened me with negative feedback, refused to pay for return shipping, and opened a case, which forced my hand into giving them a full refund, and losing on shipping both ways. I had no way of leaving them negative feedback, and even though I wasn't in the wrong, it was the threat to my feedback rating that forced my hand. 
I want to make sure buyers are happy, don't get me wrong, but I also want buyers to be held responsible for their actions. I would gladly accept a return if the buyer shipped it back, but I shouldn't be forced into making a decision of losing money or protecting my feedback rating when I did my part just as with the other dozens of transactions that had no issue.

I can see a lot of abuse with Venmo being used to fraudulently convert dollars into BTC though, so not sure if that would be doable just yet.

I am saying that because the new money that is being created isn't ending up in the hands of the average consumer, we're not seeing traditional inflation, but what we are instead seeing is an increase in stock prices relative to their returns, i.e., massive inflation in the stock market. I think this is a very real possibility when you consider what rich people/companies would do with new money at near 0% interest rates. Current reports show that 99% of new wealth created since the 2007 recession has gone to the top 1%, and it's mostly the already-well-off that are getting new loans, so it's not like we'd expect those people to be causing inflation since they're not buying what the average middle class citizen would buy.

You're still receiving value in exchange for what ever assets you're trading to obtain bitcoin. It seems like you're just bitter that some people stand to gain more on their investment even though you're not losing anything of value by exchanging in. What you call unproductive is not the case. Those coins have come from miners who invested time and money into creating those coins. Bitcoin would not be where it is today without those early users, so while they're not doing anything with the coins currently, that doesn't mean they didn't take a risk in obtaining those coins in the first place.

The initial point is that a deflationary currency is better for the individual, and that is true. Bitcoin allows the individual to store their money in a place where its value wont be eroded over time. Many people have been using gold and other commodities for this very purpose and the economy hasn't collapsed, so how is Bitcoin any different? 
In a perfect world we would have neither inflation or deflation, but it seems we have to choose one or the other in the real world. Inflationary currencies are good for some aspects of an economy, while a deflationary currency is good for others. The only uninformed opinion here is yours, as you seem to be under the impression that we can only have one or the other.

The reality is, you're greatly overstating the risk. Even early adopters with large balances can only do so much damage before the market catches on or the user runs out of BTC to dump. As the overall market cap increases, these early adopters will divest and their stake should go down, this is how the market is designed to work and grow. It would be counterproductive for them to purposely try to crash the market, and even if it worked, it would only be temporary as long as there are other people willing to buy those coins. More people than ever can mine right now and new coins are being spread out much more evenly than in the early days. So with 7MM coins still left to be mined, the power you think early adopters have is diminished with each new block.

If the current shareholders sell, they can sell on the secondary OTC market. The fund itself can't issue new shares to the general public though. In a brokerage account that is approved to trade on the OTC market, which doesn't have as strict of requirement as the qualified investors that BIT can sell to directly, then yes, they can buy these shares. Getting approved to purchase OTC stocks is not very hard, and most brokerages will allow it. So to sum it up, the answer is yes; most account holders at Ameritrade/ETrade/Fidelity/etc. should be able to buy shares in this fund.

A few things I'd want:
* Ability to view prices in any currency. I want to be able to comparison shop without needing to convert to USD/EUR/CNY first. Similar to Google Shopping.
* Easy to navigate categories with the ability for people to vote out and block items that don't belong in that category. I don't want to see diet pills when I'm searching for a TV, or a treadmill when I'm shopping for cookware. 
* Restrict the sellers ability to remove a listing if sales are pending, or create a way for the buyer to save a backup. It should be clear what the seller was advertising if the purchase is disputed. This was a problem on some forums I frequented back in the day. (Sellers would delete their ad and then I'd have no way of disputing their false advertisments.)
* Consider integrating a third party reputation service, like this Bitrated that is popping up around here. I don't know that it's the best one yet, but something that isn't specific to the site would be nice for buyers and sellers to be able to transact with first time visitors. 
* I think a fairly straight forward interface is a must. One of the things I liked about facebook vs myspace is that everything on facebook is pretty much in the same place, no matter whose page you're on. Price, shipping policies, item details, etc should all be fairly standardized and easy to navigate across multiple sellers. Some personality/customization is fine, but it shouldn't make it hard to shop. 
* Easy way to aggregate and view current orders and their shipping status. It'd also be nice to track them directly from the order history page, e.g. Amazon, eBay. 
* Clear dispute process with as many predetermined metrics for settlement as possible. I like the idea of clear guidelines for shipping requirements, handling time, tracking requirements, review period after delivery, who's responsible for insurance or damaged packaged(clear waiver of insurance option so seller is off the hook for a buyer who refuses to pay for insurance), etc. 
* I would like it if there were a way for sellers to be bonded and have something to lose so we can eliminate the long-cons where sellers are trustworthy for a few months then disappear with the BTC for a bunch of unfilled orders. This a problem even on Amazon and eBay, so probably not the easiest fix. 
* Product specific reviews, like Amazon.

I agree, the less censorship the better, but in the real world, there are cases where a private company does not want to be associated with certain activity. Very few people would complain about child porn being censored and removed from Google Images, and rightfully so. That was my point, that not all censorship is bad, and you can't really draw a line between what is acceptable and what isn't. There is a lot of gray area on the internet and companies are well within their right to censor certain activity. Ultimately, anything can end up on the internet, but it is not the duty of a private company to proliferate everyone's opinion.

I think something like less than 300,000 addresses have more than .01 in them, so we probably have less than 300,000 active Bitcoin users at the moment, probably much less. I know personally I've used close to 100 addresses. 
For the size of the market cap, we have a surprisingly low number of users, which makes me think bitcoins are actually overvalued at the moment based on the active user base. 
If 300,000 users had $100-1000 stored in BTC, the market cap would only be $30,000,000 - $300,000,000 USD. The only way we hit the current market cap is if we assume at least $10,000 USD in average value per Bitcoin user. That seems pretty high to me, since a lot of those users don't even have one whole bitcoin. 
This is not any formal metric, I know, but it does allude to Bitcoin being in a highly speculative phase, valued very much on future potential and not current use.

99% of new wealth created in today's fiat economy is going to less than 1% of the population. New dollars aren't tied to human productivity either. They are produced because the central bank says so, and those new dollars are not distributed equally. The difference is, we know how many bitcoins will ever exist. Knowing that, we can store our wealth without the fear that one day a central bank is going to come in and wipe out our value by arbitrarily issuing new dollars to only a select few people. The more people partake in the Bitcoin economy the better, but that doesn't mean you're going to get the short end of the stick by coming in late.

It reintroduces the concept of opportunity cost. With USD, you're incentivized to spend or loan, but with Bitcoin, you can save your money for when you find something truly desirable. A day of work earns someone a few hundred dollars, but unless they immediately spend their money or loan it at an interest rate above the inflation rate, they're going to have less value for the time they worked with each passing year. That just doesn't seem right to me. If a dollar buys me a soda today, why shouldn't it buy me at least one soda tomorrow?

When you buy a bitcoin, say $1,000 worth, that sum of bitcoin should hold its value even if you don't spend it. If you worked for $1,000 dollars, why should it be worth less than $1,000 in the future? In the fiat system, if you work for $1,000 dollars and don't spend that money in the immediate future, your money becomes worth less and less. In the bitcoin economy, no one is able to creat more than 21MM bitcoins, so your value is protected. The market cap has to grow, and more bitcoins are still being created until we reach the 21MM mark. Eventually, the market cap should plateau and we'll see much more modest rates of growth. In the early stages though, it is much more risky to partake in an experimental currency, so why shouldn't those people stand to gain more by taking on that risk? It's not like Bitcoin is guaranteed to succeed, and it definitely wont succeed without enough people mining.

Nonsense. It would be no different than applying a gift card to your account, which is pretty straightforward from a regulatory standpoint.  You send them $20 worth of BTC, they convert it instantly, issue you a $20 gift card and automatically apply that $20 credit to the account. If they're not already setup for gift cards, then it won't happen overnight, but it's not a very difficult proposition. They'd probably still require a credit card on file though in the event you run over your credited balance.

This is an open-ended fund, that means they can issue new shares when they purchase additional bitcoin holdings. Nothing is being diluted because each share represents a predetermined amount of BTC; that does not change. Do you not understand that concept? 1 share = 1/10th of a bitcoin, so for the fund to issue a 10 new shares, they need to purchase 1 additional bitcoin. That is not diluting the other shareholders in any way. 
Moreover, the BIT fund can only issue new shares to accredited investors, so it would make sense for them to want to issue new shares to the accredited investors so those investors can sell the shares they've held for &gt;12 months on the secondary market.

It doesn't have to be the same system. You can create a small line of credit &lt;$500 just for instant purchases like coffee, groceries, or gas, and that line of credit could automatically pay it's self back from a linked bitcoin wallet. Meaning you could spend $130 at the grocery store, which would send an instant payment from the creditors main wallet which retailers agree to accept with 0 confirmations since it is coming from a trusted company, while at the same time the creditor would debit your linked bitcoin wallet and reset your credit limit an hour later when enough confirmations are received. Yes, this convenience would cost money, but it would be much lower risk than traditional cards and thus could be offered at rates the traditional services couldn't compete with. Convenience and services do cost money; Bitcoin isn't about making everything free, it's about making things more secure, more transparent, and giving people choices. This would be just one such choice.

I do agree that perception plays a role, but as a prerequisite, you need to start with something scarce. We perceive diamonds to have value based on perception, but their real value comes from the fact that supply is restricted. In that case it is mostly artificial scarcity, contrived and controlled similar to fiat currencies. If you printed unlimited dollar bills or supplanted the diamond monopolies, you would see a massive drop in the value of each. Utility also plays a role, which you could argue falls under the perception descriptive, but even then, the actual value of an individual object can not be determined with a near unlimited supply. It is a sort of *chicken and egg* argument, but I would argue that scarcity has to supersede perception. I think the oft cited *tulip mania* is a great example of perception being overcome by lack of scarcity.

The price can keep going down and it's not really affecting the long term utility or prospects of bitcoin. The problem is no one is using Bitcoin regularly, so it's mostly speculation. If Bitcoin can get a few niche markets using Bitcoin without people looking to immediately transfer into fiat, we can at least establish a base price below which would hard to dip below. Until we establish some actually utility though, the price could go anywhere. We also have half a billion in new coins being created over the next year or so, so the market is currently in an inflationary period.

I think the remittance market could have a neutral or negative affect on price.

Not to sound like a naive optimist, but I think it's good that Mt Gox scared away the weak investors who were buying without understanding what a bitcoin is. Now I think a large percentage of people buying are those who understand it and are in it for the long haul. This is good from a stability standpoint, because we need people with thick skin who aren't going to dump with every negative article that comes along. I'm fine sitting here in the $200's while Bitcoin matures and develops the needed infrastructure to support users of all technical abilities. The reality is, Bitcoin wasn't ready to go mainstream in 2013, it's still not ready in early 2015. Hopefully in another year or two we'll have stable markets using bitcoins, giving us the ability to set a floor based on real world use cases.

Nothing is free, especially convenience. Yes, these types of services would have a fee, but it would likely be a fraction of the 2-5% that many businesses currently pay to process transactions. But who knows, I bet a lot of 3rd party companies could offer you the convenience for free if you share your purchase data with marketers. I know that sounds like a dirty concept, but there is value is being marketed to and it can be done in a way that respects privacy. Imagine an unidentifiable token which receives marketing ads based on your purchases, but is identified based on true or false questions such as "has this user ever purchased coffee for more than $4" if yes, you may receive a special offer from a coffee roaster you've never heard of, but they know nothing about you -- not your name, not your address, or even where you bought your cup of coffee before, they just submit a marketing campaign that only sends information based on preset generic criteria. I think that is an idea that could result in a great compromise between marketing companies and consumers. Pay for the fee yourself or opt-in to a marketing program…I could go for that.

I understand that, but if you have 100MM people with a $10 piece of mining hardware, that's $1,000,000,000. And if that piece of hardware came at a minimal running cost, there'd be no reason for people to not be a part of securing the network. So good luck finding someone to loan you that kind of money so you can double spend a few coins.

They don't have to be the best or the most efficient, they just have to be cheap enough to buy and operate that the cost becomes trivial for the value you get from securing the network. You could have a few dozen people in every neighborhood running one, and you could even create a private network of nodes so you're only paying transaction fees to other people within your group of like-minded individuals.

It's not a fantasy. In some markets, a 2% fee doesn't affect the merchant much since they are working with big margins, but there are many businesses that sell items with a high risk of fraud and low margins, and for those businesses, credit card chargebacks cripple their ability to accept credit cards. Some flat out refuse to accept an order if they can't verify everything is legit, and I have had legitimate orders cancelled because of it. That is a loss for the business either way. They either accept all orders and risk losing to chargebacks, or they limit acceptance and risk losing legitimate orders. This isn't some contrived fantasy, it exists all over the internet across many different product categories.

As long as the data is publicly available to be verified, then we can have an archived blockchain and an optimized in-use system. We only really need the blockchain for the purpose of auditing and finding possible discrepancies. I don't see why we would need the full blockchain 20 years back. The IRS only makes you keep records for a few years, and if everyone agreed that a blockchain was accurate as of a set date, prior data can be compressed or deleted from the optimized blockchain. Is there any real concern with not having the full blockchain on every node?

This place starts looking like Hashtalk anytime an article comes out with any sort of warning to new users. Yes, there are some misunderstandings by the author, but the point made is a fair one. This isn't the first "game changing" innovation in money,  and there are still lot of risks in owning something so cutting edge. Maybe this article looks ridiculous to those of us more knowledgable about Bitcoin, but this article isn't meant to be an overly technical breakdown of Bitcoin. This article isn't saying don't buy Bitcoin or that Bitcoin will fail, it is just advising caution and reminding potential users/investors that there are still lot of risks involved with Bitcoin right now. I'm very optimistic about Bitcoin, but let's not act like a bunch of sanctimonious cunts every time someone doesn't fully understand the technology.

When you control that much, it's not that difficult to manipulate the market and accumulate more at below market rates.

In the context above, I meant it as users who are actively holding bitcoins. With less than 300,000 wallets holding bitcoin above that amount, there can't be more than 300,000 users. There can be less, since, as you said yourself, you have more than one wallet with at least .01 BTC. I have my funds in more than one wallet too, so the above estimate would see me as multiple users. My guess would be that we're closer to only 100,000 holders of any sizable amount of BTC.

It's not an either or proposition though, not in the case of Bitcoin anyway. I don't see any real reason why Bitcoin can't function alongside fiat currencies just as it does today. Debt is risky, and it's nice being able to eliminate that risk from a global currency. I fully recognize the benefits of debt-based economies, but on a global scale, you don't want to have just one choice in how money is handled, because then a crash becomes a global crisis. The recent recession bogged down the whole world's economy, but at least each country, or group of countries, were able to handle it as they each saw fit. The future is ever changing, so no one country or leader is going to know what to do every time; this way, we get to see multiple fixes being tried at once. Bitcoin functions as a complementary currency in stable economies and a standalone currency in unstable economies; each country can still remain sovereign over it's own economic policy, but individuals are able to opt out of that system and store there wealth in a deflationary, globalized system, independent of any government.

It may have lowered donations, but that could be, like you said, because people thought they had to use bitcoin. It is the only option listed on that page, so it is very unclear unless you proceed to the next page. Since they didn't repeat the result with another payment option in the place of the Bitcoin link, they can't say with any certainty that it is Bitcoin that turned people away and not just the ambiguity of the payment options available. I am sure Bitcoin raises red flags to some ignorant users, but to suggest based on this alone that adding Bitcoin lowers donations by 7.5% is disingenuous.

Bitcoin has existed for 6 years, but it is only just now becoming mainstream enough for businesses to even consider it. Bitpay and Coinbase have been acting as merchant processors for only 2-3 years. Realistically, it's still not accessible enough to be used as a full scale replacement. It is completely naive and nonsensical to think businesses would make the switch overnight to a yet unproven technology. It is mindboggling to me that you can't see how dumb your argument is. There are still large businesses operating on technology from the 90's; businesses don't like change, change is risky, but lack of change isn't proof that the current system is superior or without issue.

You're being naively optimistic about the role they played, many of these people just mined heavily in the early days. Yes they took a bit of a risk, but is the reward commensurate with the risk they took? How many of those wallets represent someone who actually contributed to Bitcoin beyond just mining? I'm more likely to consider an alt coin if such a small percentage of people control such a large percentage of the coins. And considering so many of those coins are sitting unspent, those people now stand to benefit greatly without having to spend or invest their coins into furthering the progress of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 02:13:20
Shared wallets are not going to change that number very much. 300,000 is already an overestimation. Regardless, as the saying goes around here: if you don't have the private key, you don't own the coins. You also need to remember that just because someone has an account at Coinbase, that doesn't mean they don't also have another wallet. So we can't automatically count those users as individuals because there is guaranteed to be overlap.

That's fine if you want to mention it and see what their thoughts are, but it's more of an inconvenience at this point, especially if you're currently writing a check which likely costs them nothing to deposit. You would likely be the only customer using Bitcoin for the foreseeable future, so it would be like asking your babysitter to open up a bank account at a completely different bank just for your payments.

Or, more likely, you can use a card backed by a company who is vouching for you by extending you a small line of credit for &lt;$100 purchases.

This is not true. What makes you think they would need to be replaced instead of just adding a couple more decimal places? 
And what reasoning do you have for thinking Bitcoin will be taken over by governments? If Bitcoin succeeds, it will likely be too large of a network for any one government to control. I wouldn't be surprised if there were "altruistic" nodes funded by governments to secure the network, but that wouldn't give governments control of Bitcoin. 
I don't buy the PoS nonsense either. If the network is functioning as it should, transaction fees should be able to sustain the network. The utility of what the network offers will be worth paying for to a lot of people.
