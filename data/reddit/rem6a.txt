Its a little volatile to run day trading off GDAX (especially with fees). Maybe get in/out early off regulatory news but not sure (no history) to have known events trigger moves (summer travel demand, holiday spending season, interest rate moves, demand). With futures and derivative contracts its going to be interesting. Just a thought and good luck if you attempt anything.

Although if they did buy in, they would hammer you at every pull back with questions.

Coindesk had a good article today regarding what we can expect when Futures are written Dec 10 &amp; 18th. Took both sides and worth reading if you can find the link. Also mentioned not a bubble but we could see a little downside once we hit those dates.

100mm is kids money funding level for these guys. A 1bn fund should be next considering interst, free flow of stupid money and having the popularity factor behind the funding. And give time for one of the Sovern wealth funds to jump in. Just a guess.

Curious if this has anything to do with Russia coming into he market soon. Maybe people got excited (another country of buyers) and it spiked, high volume and crash. Just a thought but I can't access any accounts right now because of this, just states system down.

2.3mm/price of btc at short = x (number of btc at purchase)
Current price - short price =Difference per coin
Difference *  BTC shorted = loss (changes constantly)

I work with advisors and those who would buy digital currency have issues with reporting gains and tax reporting. Layer compliance not able to asses risk to the currency, creates risk of lawsuits around suitability. ETF companies will most likely be the first to bring digital currencies to investment vehicles and amend the issues above or attempt. Good articles out there regarding speed bumps to make this happen.

Maybe he bought the leveraged VIX ETN last week. Causing massive market swings.
