Coinsecure is trusted one..may I know which exchange you use where you are not allowed to transfer coins to your wallet? Get out of that exchange asap.

Yeah you maybe right but problem here is bitcoin does not revolves around America only, but the whole world and the country I live in momentum is about to start.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:26:34

@_date: 2017-12-26 03:49:14
Exactly what i am doing ,i just keep my altcoins on exchange and couple of hundred dollars of bitcoin for trading, everything else i have it in cold storage on my bootable Linux Usb. so that i cannot panic sell in the heat of the moment.

BTC is an original idea backed by so many loyal investors. BTC is a father of  ETH or any other cryptocurrency . Think about it, if you will try to kill the father then child will suffer. so please have some respect, try to change your diaper it is full or ask for a help.

Our politicians sucks,they are soo corrupt .Taking our country back to stone age. I went to SBI bank to take 3L cash out of my account and to my surprise they said they are out of cash ,how is it possible that big branch in metropolitan city doesn't have 3L with them ,anyways it took them 2 days to give me cash, I have waisted my time visiting SBI branch multiple times and I have to give them a letter signed with explanation that I need this money for an ongoing construction in my house.After sharing my views with others they all have same experience. What's happening to our country now a days?? It feels like something freaking big is going to happen something like financial crisis or something.i am no expert just my intuitions.

I am one of the user of this  exchange coinsecure but I am so happy that I always kept my coins in hardware wallet.
