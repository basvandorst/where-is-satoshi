Hash rate is the computing power, or speed that your computing power can do the calculations to find the next block.

Also, I believe if you didn't use any of your capital gains allowance in the previous financial year, that can be brought forward to allow you double this year.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:42:33
So your annual income + your crypto gains = more than 45k, then you pay 20 percent on the amount over 45k.

The more I learn about it, the more confident I am in its future success. Bitcoin its tangibly better than what we have now in almost every way, with scope to improve and evolve even further.
Honestly I am so excited for the next 2-5 years, in my opinion there's very few ways for it no to succeed.

The good thing with them already being onboarded to an exchange, when the FOMO kicks in they won't be waiting for approvals etc
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:46:31

Doing this doesn't rely on other people's FUD.

ATM is your best bet.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:56:10
The transaction should show in the blockchain almost instantly.
That would be an issue with gdax not carrying out your withdrawal, than an issue with btc itself.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:09:56
With Lightning it is possible to do transactions off of the blockchain, only registering your final balance on the blockchain when you close the Lightning channel.

Just to make it clear, I'm not disagreeing this could happen.
If it hits 20k, I'll be happy, if not I get to watch you eat old man dick.

Hey John!
I hope you're right.

There are lot of people claiming to be making profit from Genesis mining or hashflare.
I'm unaware if there is actual proof they are mining coins and not just a Ponzi that takes from the newest investor and gives to the older ones, but I have put a very small amount of money into hashflare as an experiment.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:27:29
4k would go a long way in a poor area of South America, though!
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:46:32
Nope they cannot go anywhere other than back to your wallet or to the wallet you sent them to.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:41:49
Yeah you can do exactly that.
But then you have to turn that currency back into your currency before the price of Bitcoin goes up in your currency.
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:36:01
Looks fine in alien blue.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:57:51
Looks like somewhat of a sell-off happening before opening. This is positive for people looking to get the price low before it goes live then going long on undervalued stock?
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:00:54
Because that would make laundering money really fucking easy.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:16:16
If you're on the same computer you had then, or at least same hard drive

CoinMarketApp and Coinbase can also do this.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:31:00

Nowhere near 12. 17 BCH blocks found in the last hour , though.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:51:06
surely that's not possible?
you would have been better not selling the bit you did.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:30:28
The thing is if everyone was cashing out their altcoins, bitcoin would be up. I'm not aware of anywhere that you can cash all alts out straight into fiat?

Say your 10k got you 10BTC, later on they are worth 10k per BTC.
You sell 1BTC to cover your 10k investment, you have made 9k profit on that 1BTC which you are liable for tax on. However, proving exactly what date and price you got your Bitcoin for is probably quite difficult without an exchange aiding the govt.

So someone places a short on BTC, betting the price will go down. (being able to 'sell' BTC at a time in the future, for the current price. This costs them money.)
They are forced to deposit an amount of money, in order to cover potential rises of BTC in the meantime. If the price increases more than the money they have to cover it, their position gets closed and they lose the difference. 
Please feel free to correct this if I didn't explain so good.

Not only coverage, but the first exchange that can run Lightning transactions is going to have mass new user sign up, just because people can save themselves a ton of transaction fees.

Realistically you could get by with a currency where the smallest denomination is equivalent to $0.05 or $0.10, how much stuff do you buy that is priced individually less than that? And anything priced higher can be rounded up or down, Canada already did away with the penny.

Ever? I would say 95%.
Within the next 2 years around 75%
Unless some drastic flaw is found in the coding or fundamentals of the network which have not been discovered in the last 10 years, the basic principal of the supply constantly dwindling would indicate the price going one direction on a long time line.

Was recently running some hypothetical situations through my brain recently and one that came to mind was;
If I wanted to pull my BTC money away from volatility into a stable coin for a not insignificant period of time, say, 1 year. What would you say would be the best/most trustworthy coin to do that? Tether?
Let's say that this was $500k USD, would you personally trust half a mill in Tether?
This is purely hypothetical, I don't have half a mill.

The fact is nearly every good crypto programmer is working on evolving Bitcoin rather than some obscure altcoin. There's no reason that Bitcoin can't evolve to be a better cryptocurrency rather than being replaced by one.
It has a massive first mover advantage, which means more in this ecosystem than most due to the hashing power being directly related to the security of the network.

The price isn’t directly tied to the difficulty, but they are correlated in a loose way.
The difficulty is directly related to the total hashing rate of the network, the more people simultaneously mining bitcoin, the higher the difficulty goes in order to keep block time at 10 mins.
The higher the price, the more people are mining bitcoin, the higher the difficulty adjusts so in a loose way they will go up and down together but it is not a direct correlation , more like cause and effect.

Yes the seed is basically a long number encrypted into a chain of words.
Using any wallet that supports the 12/24 word encryption system you're using can restore your wallet using just your seed words.
This is why it is important to look after your seed as anyone who holds the seed has full access to your bitcoin.
You do not need to be able to use the trezor/ledger to recover your coins.
Please do not keep your hardware wallet and your seed in the same place! For security and fire/water damage risk.

Very straightforward with the chrome app.

It will likely be within a few seconds but obviously you are relying on someone to be on the other end of the transaction.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:00:34
No he is saying let it generate the seed for you then find those words in a book of your choosing and write the page/word number down that those words are on.
You could even make your own encryption by multiplying each number by (x) . So all you would have written down is;
23/47,17/21,145/2,213/65 etc. Then say (x2) at the end as a reminder that you multiplied the original numbers by 2.
