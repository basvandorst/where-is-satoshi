lnd and eclair are pretty stable, there were some problems with c-lightning, but I believe that they were ironed out.   
It's still not a stable release by any means, I wouldn't trust it with more than 100USD ATM, first try it on testnet, send some transactions, get used to the UI/CLI and then consider using on mainnet. 
Don't forget to report any bugs and problems with user experience!

Using VPSs centralizes the network around few hosting companies, although I wish every technology well.

Fee for individual Lightning transaction is hovering around 1sat/transaction and as instantaneous as it gets. Activating LN for mainstream customers moves traffic from Bitcoin blockchain to LN, one BTC transaction enables many LN transactions. If you think that going from 4tx/s to 32tx/s by using 8x bigger blocks and isolating people on weak networks is a solution to BTC's problem then would you kindly kill yourself? We need to scale to VISA's throughput... It's measured in thousands of TX/s, what are you going to do? Make blocks 1GB? Linear solutions to non-linear problems are what I call useless shits, not solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:07:17
Increasing block size is linear solution to a problem that increases at rates much faster than linear, going from 4tx/s for 1MB blocks to 32tx/s for 8MB blocks is nothing in comparison with VISA's thousands of transactions per second. It's nothing more than a temporary patch. Let's not forget that bigger blocks stop people on shitty networks from using Bitcoin.
Fees are horrible at the moment and we have quite problem, but no developer actually said that Bitcoin is truly ready for mass adoption. It's version 0.15.1, people were looking for quick cash grab and now they are crying because fees are high.   
Let's be honest, some people earned so much money on the cryptocraze that they can pay überhigh fees for years. If you want things to change - help out, translate Bitcoin clients to your language, report bugs, help with testing lightning network, use SegWit, write and translate documentation.

Testnet blockchain is much smaller, it synchronized in about 2h for me, weights no more than 40GB
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:03:09


People can probably live with UX inconveniences, if it means much lower fees and faster transactions, but lost funds are unacceptable, I'm not really experienced at programming, but I like tinkering and I have a lot of free time, gonna report all bugs that I find.    
Hmmm... it'll probably be a good idea to record everything and supply short video examples in case somethings goes wrong. 
And BTW thanks for your work on eclair wallet, you're awesome, have a nice day!

Atom is not really that great at handling big files, sublime text or notepad++ is the way to go. :)

In electrum you can create new SegWit wallet, there is an option to import addresses into current wallet, but I haven't tested it.

It's called Pass and supports OTP, it works from terminal so it'd run on every dumpster :D You can also use Qt GUI.

In fact, it's not. Mozilla coordinates the development process and has most of the devs, but Firefox is owned by community. 
You can say that the Firefox trademark is owned by Mozilla... but same applies to Bitcoin, AFAIK the Bitcoin trademark was owned by MtGox(or rather it's parent company) and wasn't sold to anyone.

You can just setup an OpenVPN on VPS for 3$/mo, set it to 443 port and show your pretty middle finger.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:07:58
But how would they know what the fuck I'm hosting on my remote server?
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:14:28
Internet is not anonymous, you can try to obscure information, but only to some degree. We're talking about net neutrality and limiting access to bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:33:46
Firefox logo and trademark has legal ownership, but not the source. Bitcoin is also a registered trademark owned by MtGox's parent. Bitcoin's logo is in the public domain, so it's not a problem. They said that they're allowing for free use of their trademark, but they can change their decision and all users of bitcoin's trademark must obey new rules. 
From non-legal point of view - it still is a scam to call your app "Bitcoin Wallet" or whatever and default to "Bitcoin Cash".    
Stop trying to defend a misleading behaviour.

Communication between my VPN and client is encrypted, I'm using HTTPS's port, they don't know what I'm doing. All they see is some connection from one IP to another. If China is not blocking it... it's pretty ok.

Dem open source contributors manipulating masses with their code!
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:13:20
So when I create Firefox Embers and advertise it as a true Firefox... it's ok?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:54:02
Didn't know they're using the same address for BCH and BTC, there is little to no chance of users confusing the two while sending their coins, so it's mostly okay. You're right, sorry, my bad. Have a nice day!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:51:09
I'm not talking about BCH, I'm talking about developers and engineers behind cryptocurrencies and innovation. I don't care for some forums, reddit, medium articles, facebook posts, talk is cheap - what matters is the code.   
People with millions of dollars can fork Bitcoin and other coins all they want, without good will of FOSS contributors their fork will collapse down like a rhino riding a gorilla. I'd like to see Roger Ver write 30 LOC ;)

*Bitcoin and BCH as game devs*
**BCH:** Oh, your game runs like shit? Buy more RAM, new CPU and another SSD or let us run and stream it for ya ;)
**BTC:** We can optimize this, give us some time.
BTC is technologically superior, case closed. Go home.

If the website/app is misconfigured it is possible to strip TLS layer from the connection and proceed with MITM attack.   
Although highly unlikely in the typical home WLAN scenario...

Yeah, let's start geolocating, IP throttling and checking people's wallets, then we can change Bitcoin's name to Fiatcoin... or Failcoin.  
I don't need financial motivation to run node, wet dreams about truly decentralized currency, supporting Open Source, community project and watching it grow are enough of a motivation for me. Also... It's fun to ban segshit nodes.

If it's possible - switch your routers to LEDE, your phone(if manufacturer doesn't care to update) to LineageOS (official version, if exists).    
Remember - "keep shit updated", it's highly unlikely that you'd be a target of attack using 0-day exploit.
