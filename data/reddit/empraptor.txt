I guess I don't know enough about Bitcoin protocol to tell whether an attacker can selectively propagate a second transaction to miners with high compute capacity.
EDIT: Also, as someone else mentioned, won't mining software choose the transaction with higher transaction fee if there is not enough funds for both transactions?

thefts like this will happen no matter what measures are taken.  one way to reduce exposure to risk is by forming a network of exchanges/banks/payment services between which transfer of cryptocurrency credits is easy but customer withdrawals are as cumbersome and slow as withdrawing cash from a bank.  so hopefully attacks are detected early enough that the institutions remain solvent.  probably will help to have insurance on the funds and employ people experienced at this kind of security.  so probably means fees will have to be collected for keeping deposits or raising transaction fees.

I'm sure there are already posts on the joint statement but here it is anyway.  Bitcoin companies stating how Mt. Gox consulted them, Mt. Gox failed their customers, and the rest of them are not like Mt. Gox blah blah:
[Coinbase Blog: Joint Statement Regarding MtGox](
Supposedly, original title of it referred to Mt. Gox's insolvency.
[thread about the statement](
I just realized the time that joint statement was released, 10PM ET, is an hour after you observed mtgox going down - 11AM in Japan.  I thought it was coordinated with mtgox because it happened around same time, but maybe the statement was hastily put together when they saw the site go down?

I know how Bitcoin works in general and have reviewed some of the code.  Exploiting vulnerabilities in Bitcoin is not what I mean here.  See PoliticalDissident's reply for examples.
But I expect people looking for exploits in the Bitcoin protocol/implementation will hack it for profit sooner or later.

And all I have been asking for is some substance to back up your statement that NPR is a source of propaganda and that it is just as divisive/misinforming(?) as Fox News.
I hope I didn't give you the impression that I take NPR to be messenger of some god or other.  I don't find NPR boring.  I find it informative and engaging.  I find it is clearly and measurably better news source compared to Fox News.  But where this talk of blind devotion comes from, I have not a clue.

Please disregard my speculation below and refer to the [Here's a summary...]( thread on if you haven't already seen it on front page.
--- original comment follows ---
The timing of the joint statement coinciding with mtgox halting operation seems to indicate there was some coordination with mtgox.  Maybe mtgox fessed up to the rest of the bitcoin players and this was the suggested course of action.

If store of value is perceived as the killer app, I think this make the value of bitcoin is less dependent on other uses and makes it easier for speculation to drive price swings - making it less valuable for other uses.  A self-fulfilling prophecy, it seems like.

I guess that's true in a sense.
It's just that I don't see the 200K BTC as being wholly separated from the BTC market.
200K BTC that was previously unavailable for trade will be made available via this ETF once approved.  How much new fiat money will appear on the BTC scene due to this ETF and how that compares to market value of 200K BTC is the question maybe?

Let me rephrase my question then.
Are all source of fraud that involve Bitcoin expected to incur cost that is less than costs incurred by frauds involving credit cards when compared in terms of % transaction volume associated with each payment method?
I ask because it seems like bad actors will find ways to commit fraud one way or another, regardless of payment method.  We are only looking at chargebacks, but I wonder if the unspoken assumption that there are no other forms of fraud that may be more costly in Bitcoin markets holds true.

Thanks for the entertaining reply.  I'll check out Localbitcoins.
I am less concerned about diarrhea and more with being able to convert bitcoins to other currencies without being scammed or losing the value stored in some other fashion during such a transaction.
From what I've read elsewhere, it sounds like Paypal is one form of payment that should be avoided.
I suppose I don't ask about Bacon safety since it's a low cost good that I don't plan on having much of at any given moment.

Depends on the person, I guess.  If you get to know some M.D.'s you will run into a number of them who know only enough statistics to do their job and aren't interested in learning.  Some may have trouble interpreting p values, for example.  Scary thought, given that they are suppose to glean useful information journals they read.  If Ron Paul knows a lot about finance and economics, it's not because he's M.D.  It's because he's interested in it.

None of these scenarios provide a way to gauge the value of bitcoin.
They sound like wonderful ideas.

It would be impossible to make Bitcoin infinitely divisible.  You can't have an implemention that allows transfer amount to be arbitrary rational numbers, for example, because the set of rational numbers is countably infinite and there is no way to guarantee that we can represent arbitrary member of the set with limited resources.
But for argument's sake if btc value increases exponentially relative to goods and services, I expect that average size of ledger entry will increase linearly over time due solely to the increasing precision needed.  I don't know enough about bitcoin protocol to say anything else on this topic.
