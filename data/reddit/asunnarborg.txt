The green circles (block rewards) do start at 50... you see 4 years worth of green dots before the halving down to 25?

A USD bet proposal on this thread... for shame

So if you're not buying directly from the company, they're probably going to match your buy/sell order with someone who wants to do the opposite (sell/buy) and help with the "exchange" :) Check out how an order book looks/works.

Have the "Lawnmower Bitcoin Purchase" in a shade of purple we use in the app, and the "Bitcoin Purchased" in blue, but seeing now how it might be a little hard to distinguish. Thanks for the comment.

Which chart's don't you like, some near the intro overviewing the price history? Tried to keep the primary (left) y axis consistent throughout. A non-linear (log, etc.) scale might've looked pretty good as I looked at far back data showing the rise from &lt;$1 but might have had to shift the scale back to linear for the 2015 &amp; Lawnmower analysis which could've been confusing.

Pretty cool...
Didn't like these 2 parts:
$1,242 (surpassed gold) - a little too dramatized for me. the unit (one ounce of gold to one bitcoin) comparison is pretty much irrelevant, much like comparing different stock prices. a total market cap chart might be good to replace or add? i also don't really like the "lowest", "highest", "average" under the bitcoin chart. it's not on the gold chart and i don't like the bitcoin price "average" on this data.
The May 2014 Polis campaign fundraising effect on btc price chart. the numbers on the unlabeled x and y axes look so random.

Was definitely awesome to see some bitcoin discussion on a more "mainstream" subreddit without being instantly downvoted :)

haha some ballsy predictions

uh oh - "Maximum number of Bitcoins that will be mined: 22 million"
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:37:18
so in 2021 - $3,000 USD for crazyflashpie or 12 BTC for BTCPHD :)

Well it totally depends on the exchange rate of bitcoin in the future as the block reward drops. If the price continues to rise as the block reward falls it will help that side of the incentive structure. The transaction fees may also represent a meaningful part of the incentive if the exchange rate is high enough as well, or perhaps we'll see miners charging more transaction fees to compensate, or acting as some sort of filter over what type of transactions will find their way into blocks, etc.

what part? 
GBTC ≈ $100
GBTC ≈ .1 bitcoin
GBTC ≈ $1000/bitcoin
bitcoin ≈ $580
GBTC / bitcoin ≈ 173%
Thus GBTC is trading at a ≈ 73% premium

keeping the "gold that can teleport" going lol
good stuff chris!
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:54:20
Absolutely - and actually on the horizon now :)

[Lawnmower]( uses Coinbase and has a [stats page]( like this :)

Most agree the probability of a BTC ETF in 2018 is extremely low.
The SEC can delay the VanEck / SolidX decision only until the end of Q1 2019.
In 2019 we will also likely see many new BTC ETF proposals.
Curious to see how bullish everyone is on an ETF approval in 2019 &amp; any related thoughts.
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:07:19
yup top 5 all are  
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:51:49
We have been at \~$6k for a very long time now. How long will this continue? What &amp; when is the next bull catalyst -- Bakkt, ETF, etc?

Thanks a lot &amp; awesome tool. I pulled the data manually :p
@_date: 2018-11-08 17:04:53
ah sorry what's the best, bitcoinmarkets?
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:08:04
when do you think it turns around or one gets approved (if ever)?
@_date: 2016-09-14 14:40:07
Think you're reading the data slightly incorrect. About 10.5 million addresses have a balance over 0 bitcoin. About 4.5 million addresses have a balance over .001 bitcoin ($0.61). Meaning about 6 million have less than $.61 worth. Also, a single user may control numerous addresses with one or multiple wallets.

The expected future increases aren't known, every single person would model it with different inputs.
@_date: 2016-05-09 18:16:04
Just wrote a [quick blog post]( looking at both the rise in price of bitcoin &amp; GBTC over the last few months. The price of GBTC has grown at a much faster rate than BTC leading to the current 60%+ premium (the highest since the 1st data points about a year ago).
@_date: 2015-11-22 03:20:22
because not everyone agrees on the "expected future increase" values? what's "rational" mean to you - this is the case with stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, currencies, etc. it's what analysts and hedge funds research all day and allows you to make money  investing by viewing things differently than others.

Recently wrote this paper on Bitcoin to feature on the [Lawnmower]( apps &amp; website.
I have a background in finance so tried to write it as similarly to an investment research report I’d write for traditional assets as possible.
The piece is meant to give an overview of the Bitcoin network, the blockchain, &amp; bitcoin as an investible asset &amp; the intended audience is a newcomer to Bitcoin or someone who has done some brief preliminary investigation.
Would love to hear any feedback.
@_date: 2016-07-18 15:22:35
New research, news, price, index &amp; market data, UI/UX updates, &amp; more on app &amp; website.

Hey there,
As you can see in the footnote: (13) Data source &amp; additional information: coindesk.com/bitcoin-venture-capital – of note, a small minority of deals deal with Blockchain Assets
outside of bitcoin.
Went broad on the terminology to encompass the fact that some of the deals are Ethereum or alternate blockchain related &amp; not just Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-18 15:23:48
New website, iOS &amp; Android app updates, &amp; an index tracking top Blockchain Assets. All links on lawnmower.io
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:35:27
Thanks a lot. I think bouncing around Investopedia links is a great way to learn about traditional finance &amp; investing.
@_date: 2016-07-28 21:32:41
Thanks a lot for the suggestions - good topic ideas for sure.
