They've been good to me. 6 months-ish so far.

Been working great for me. Every month I load what I need to cover bills. Couldn't pay my car payment, car insurance, internet, ect with Bitcoin without it.
Even had my card stolen and they transferred my balance to a new card.

Not familiar with his material I'm guessing...

Until you need to pay a bill that needs to connect to a bank account, and debit cards aren't options. Student loan, car payment, credit cards, etc...

That's a completely different device, no? The entropy isn't a hardware wallet...

Most ATMs have limits around 400 -500 dollars. So just drive around to several ATM to withdraw enough money then what, put that into a bank account?

Wouldn't it just be easier to just leave the money in my account instead of buying Bitcoin just to have to do theses work arounds to pit the money in my account. Not even the card that this post was about is available in the US, unless that changed the past 6 months. Being 100% Bitcoin is just not a real option at this point.

Do you believe it would be better not to go to college if you can't pay for it out right? The credit card is paid off every month, and the car will be paid off within a year of purchase.
How do you feel about mortgages ?

Yeah...its been out of stock and there is no word they are making new ones.

Yeah I remember when he first posted about the prototype.  Not a fan of the design personally. It's weird in all these years those are the only two options for this function.

According to this:
0.0006528 would have been the appropriate fee if you wanted a quick confirmation - which is 6x greater than your fee.
