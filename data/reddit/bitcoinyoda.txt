please mention also that 99% of all empty blocks are mined by the same Antpool... just a coincidence no? Actually is quite profitable to mine empty blocks, take the reward of 12 BTC, meanwhile users are struggling to get their txs into a block with high fees... 
I was waiting for a fix for this bug for years but seems that there are many interests into paying miners for mining empty blocks.

Yes it is decentralized, but not the price. The network. The price is controlled by exactly the enemies of Bitcoin. Don't be fooled by the latest surge in price. It will go down and again will surge even higher.  
Hodlers and buyers DO NOT control the price. What they control is that the BTC network remain intact, not corrupted, not manipulated. The price is just an aspect that only media cares about.

It could be used to sign with your BTC address a door locker of an apartment.  
For example you rent an short term apt. from  and they have implemented (not yet) a system together with the apt. owners that when you pay with BTC, only that BTC address will open the door of the rented apt.  
It could be used for many many applications. Is a great feature that will be used later massively. Patience, Satoshi knew why created...

[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

All txs should be done in BTC ONLY, p2p, wallet 2 wallet! That's why we have Bitcoin, to not depend on any intermediary!  
WAKE UP PEOPLE!

Exactly because Bitcoin is an **immutable** blockchain makes it strong.  
If Bitcoin blockchain would be an editable blockchain and a tool to trace anybody, NOBODY will use it anymore. For that we already have fiat money.  
The problem IS NOT at Bitcoin side when a "bad guy actor" is using it to steal money from others. The problem is with the people that ignore the very fact: **Bitcoin = be your bank, act accordingly (secure your wallets).**  
The problem are NOT the thefts of your wallets, but the govs that will trace, block, monitor all your wallets. In that case you are fucked!

The best way to do it:  
Step 1: generate a new segwit wallet, offline, using  with derivation path 49  
Step 2: use the passphrase into Samourai wallet to add your new created segwit wallet  
Step 3: (Optional import your Mycelum wallet into Electrum, to control better fees) Send all your Mycelium balance to one of your new created segwit wallet (Samourai)  
Step 4: Optional you could use the same (segwit) passphrase into Electrum to import the wallet, to have the wallet operational in 2 different apps.

Yep, those p2p decentralized exchanges are now exactly how was BTC in 2009-2010, just a weird "thing". Many ignored them and regret it later for that.  
I think very few people really understand the words "p2p" and "decentralized", they do not "feel" the power of these 2 words and in special when are together.  
I always look at Coinbase as a downloading some movie, but now using a "p2p decentralized" torrent and using instead a "centralized hub" of the gov controlled repository. In the same time being proud of me that I download a "pirated content" without paying nothing. Wrong: I pay with my freedom.

Yes, immediately. If they use an intermediary for paying you in BTC, you are back to the same shit like with fiat, or even worse.  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to be a kick in the balls to all intermediaries and free people.  
I have a client of mine (that pays me in BTC), that still do not have an income in BTC, but he buy BTC as store of value and pay suppliers like me. Not too many but slowly the number is growing. That company understand that keeping fiat in a bank account is more riskier than having BTC in his own wallet. Yes of course they didn't put everything they have, but they have now a large reserve in BTC.  
They are very grateful to me for that, because I convince them long time ago to pay me in BTC.  
Being a freelancer, here you have a list of places that already pays in BTC:

Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
You have been warned!  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc

LTC is just the perfect example of playground for BTC. All major implementations of BTC are first tested on LTC. Is the correct way to do great things. First you need to test something before launching on live environment. If something go bad, there is no huge loss.

If you think a bit more, Bitcoin is the real money, not fiat.  
Bitcoin have a proof of existence on the blockchain.  
Fiat is just a promise by central banks.  
When you own BTC it is your PROPERTY.  
When you have fiat, even cash, is just a promise to pay you a value, but on the note it says: property of... x central bank. Is never yours...  
Think again about this aspect.

For sure, I do not discard that. 99% are leaking the user info. That's why soon many people that care about their financial privacy will start using P2P decentralized exchanges like Bisq.   
Yes many would say that these are not good for "trading", but the main purpose of those p2p decentralized exchanges would be to make possible for people to buy BTC in a safe way.  
Who will want to risk, they can continue to use the centralized, monopolized, manipulated exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, gdax, Bitfinex, Bitstamp etc and be tracked, seized, controlled, taxed etc.  
But the important thing is that the new comers know the risks before they start using it.  
I am not against (dumb) people  that are using them, I am against people that "recommend" these centralized exchanges to all noobs, without mentioning any of the risks they have to take. That's why we have here on r/Bitcoin every day tons of complaints, questions, cries etc about these shit exchanges. People do not know what to expect and get burned.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:02:54
Because having Bitcoin is like  having a winning lottery ticket from the future. You just have to wait until the lottery day. The prize is NOT in worthless fiat money, is in: freedom, value, security, power.  
Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now people (us) we have to continue his work. Hodling is just a small part.

They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

This is exactly like with a "problem child": he doesn't want to learn/read a book, you give him a palm on his neck to wake up. Even if he doesn't like it, at least will stop saying "no, no, no" and in the end will read/learn and later after years will thank you for that.  
I don't care if I am harsh with my warning, but at least some of them will wake and use their brain a bit more.

Yes, you could pay with all of those any invoice with your BTC directly.  
If you are afraid to use BTC you should go back to fiat. I am sorry for you.  
Me personally I used some of them and works fine for years.  
There is missing one from that list: cashila.com. It was a great service, even integrated into Mycelium wallet, but they get eaten by corporations and they decided to move to other type of business.  
Cashila paid a lot of my bills with BTC.

People have to have options not just one direction. Make them to think not just follow others like sheeple.  
I never said that Coinbase is a scam. Scam means a lot. I just warn that Coinbase is a bank and I gave them more options.  
Don't you see here that almost all n00bs think that Bitcoin = Coinbase? This is the biggest error they make, at the beginning and it is my duty as long time bitcoiner and early adopter to warn them. I can't say just use x exchange, I give them options to choose. Is their responsibility what to do, but when you "recommend" them only Coinbase and they get burned, then it is YOUR responsibility because you push them into that shit.

Coinbase is using a some kind of fractional reserve with BTC. You give them money they give you BTC IOUs.  
You will never see the Coinbase wallet address on public blockchain, that means you see them in your Coinbase but doesn't exist! Is just a promise of BTC. Coinbase is just playing you.

I am in Bitcoinlandia from 2012 and used/tested/read many things. If I see a bad review for a bitcoin service, I dig up to see if really needs to be removed from my lists of bitcoin services. If a service is still in my lists means that worth use it.  
Yes we are swimming in dark waters, we are at the beginning of something new and revolutionary and is normal to be suspicious to anything new coming. But just testing with small amounts and see how it works is not a big deal. I did that with many until I stick with just some. I open my eyes and ears to anybody talking about these services and make notes.

For all those buying BTC I just want to remember them only one question: **why did you bought BTC?**  
1. If you answer to that question with "I want to get rich quick, by selling BTC and get the goat shit fiat" - [my advice is this](   
2. If you answer to that question with "I bought BTC just to secure my future and my freedom" - [I salute them with this message](  
So try answer yourself where you stand.  
DISCLAIMER: I am married with children and I live on BTC from 2015. I have also put aside a good portion of my BTC stash that not even my wife's lawyer couldn't find in case of a divorce (every man with BTC should consider this, you never know with women). My BTC is a form of anti-divorce protection: "if you try to divorce, you get nothing".  
Kids? They better start from now taking BTC from me, little by little and HODL, if they hope someday I will die to take my BTC they will have a surprise: get nothing. I teach my kid to HODL and how to recover wallets, I gave her every month some good amount of satoshis into her wallet. I make treasure games with hidden passphrases to find them and recover wallets. She knows that this is the only way to have her future insured.

Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.

[Here is a very good debunking of that FUD](
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:13:37
Bitcoin is still in early phase. We are already too crowded. I think over-publicity is not good. We still have free publicity from MSM (even if is bad).  
When Wikileaks announced in 2010 their BTC acceptance it was also too early to bring too much attention (even Satoshi was concerned with that).  
We have today's problems with the BTC network just because it is adopted too fast. A system like this is not just like a stupid mobile app and needs more time and devs dedication to do the right things. Otherwise all is for nothing. A simple error can bring BTC to collapse (aka see the other forks that failed).
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:24:15
I am already boycotting those merchants that uses intermediaries like Bitpay or Coinbase to get payments in BTC. Using an intermediary for taking BTC contravene to Bitcoin definition - [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract.

@_date: 2017-12-03 07:03:19
Yes it is. I am living only with BTC from 2015.  
r/LivingOnBitcoin it is possible if you really want it.  
I will explain in a TLDR my case, but is not necessary to be the same for you.  
1. You need a previous stash of BTC: mined, bought/earned in early years.  
2. You will need to find a way to be paid for your work in BTC. Direct wallet to wallet or using Bitwage.com to receive your salary ONLY in BTC  
3. Close all your bank accounts, CC BS like these. Otherwise you are tempted or forced to go back to fiat.  
4. Convince your landlord (if you rent a house) to pay him in BTC  
5. Convince as many you can small merchants around you to accept your BTC. This can be achieved more easier by creating meetup groups with friends, neighbors, small merchants. Start low, be patient, learn more to be able to teach others. Well informed people will catch easier Bitcoin.  
6. Use exclusively only your BTC wallet when you pay. Those so called "bitcoin debit cards" are just a joke, to fool you to go back to fiat. Don't think that you will save more money by using them. You save money when you pay with BTC, wallet to wallet, because that merchant will give you guaranteed a discount, for how much he earn by currency appreciation. My example, I have 20% discount on all I buy from my local grocery store, just by paying in BTC.  
7. This is an extreme point and apply only if you really care for your financial privacy: I never pay a merchant that uses BTC payment platforms by others intermediaries (Coinbase, Bitpay etc). Bitcoin is not meant to be used through any intermediary, exactly for that was created, to cut those bloodsuckers and spies. Bitcoin is a P2P currency not a P2B2P...  
I never care too much about fees, delays etc. I know it is a temporary issue and I know that will be fixed soon. I just handle it. Yes I am looking to pay less fees, I am planing to create my own LN node, I am using segwit addresses, I am managing and consolidating all my wallets etc. This is part of the "game", I am my own banker now so I am responsible for all this shit.  
**From now on my money will be managed ONLY by me not others !**  
I hope my case can give more light in your plans (if you have that in mind).

You charge in your regular currency, they pay the amount in BTC at average price of the day.  
My advice, wait to bill them until the price goes down a bit more so you could get more satoshis :) later you will be happy.  
If you have a client that doesn't have BTC, you could use Bitwage.com to receive in BTC their regular payment in fiat. This is a great tool for those who work worldwide, for example you live in Thailand and you have a client in US. You send them the bill with the mention of the bank account of Bitwage linked to your bitwafe account. They send the USD to that US bank account (for them it's easy) and you receive BTC in your wallet, wherever you are.

**This is a warning!**  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters (BBVA) and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
You have been warned! Do not come back here and complain about Coinbase, we are not here to see/fix their shit, post on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase if you have a problem with them, it is NOT our problem.  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

I can say it here. I have 2 types of wallets stored in 2 different ways:  
- 1 wallet passphrase hidden into a nice text, posted on many different online webs. I can go anytime and take that text and extract the words, in the order only I know it and recover the wallet with several BTC in it.  
- 1 wallet embedded into a nice picture using steganography. [That was inspired from Andreas tweet long time ago]( I can post that picture anywhere online or on my living room wall and anytime recover the wallet, without nobody noticing that contain a wallet with several BTC in it.  
Many will say to keep your seed on a paper in a bank vault. Pfff I will never trust a bank to keep anything for me!  
Be inventive and keep always copies of your wallet. And most important: **always practice the recovery of your wallets, to see if is working fine, before putting any funds in it and also after, just to make sure you are doing right**

You get confused.  
If you never go back to fiat, you never have to pay taxes for that new income.  
If you are paid in BTC, you are already paid taxes for that income, no matter in what currency you get. Because your employer is already deducting the tax from your salary.  
You keep BTC, pay in BTC and you always win.  
This is not money laundering, this is how you keep your financial private, because is a right, not a privilege.

99% of "conspiracies" are actually facts.  
Just take some 10 big retailers and follow the money and see who is behind the scenes... These big entities couldn't survive without a big balls money maker behind them. There are too many implications in their processes without need of a bank to sustain them with "free" loans and other favors. and this is not happening now, but it was a process of "corruption" done in decades until they get stuck and forced to play the banksters game.

No, they never make public their proof of stake or any information like this. Coinbase is using a semi-fractional reserve and will end up like Mt.Gox in a disaster.  
They have many users that uses their same wallet, that means the bitcoins in those wallets will never leave Coinbase (or reach the real Bitcoin blockchain) until they make an external tx to an address that is NOT Coinbase wallet.  
Everything you buy from them (GDAX included) stay on their chain.  
Only when you move out from their chain, they will make a real BTC tx that appear on the Blockchain. That's why many people now they have long delays of receiving their BTC into real wallets. Coinbase have to first obtain those BTC and make the real tx. That means taking from a reserve or fooling others to give their BTC.    
That means, what you buy on Coinbase are just IOUs, fake BTC. Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.

No.  
Send CB coins to a shapeshift exchange, then mix them, split them into many txs of altcoins, whatever you like or have wallets. Then after few days (not in the same day) and with another IP exchange those altcoins to other new created BTC addresses. From there put them into Bisq (that also you could use a BIP39 seed into it) and do whatever you like.  
Yes, you could use Bisq also to shapeshift your BTC, but I would prefer to use already shapeshifted BTC in it because if you send directly from CB to Bisq, those coins are already tainted, so you will compromise all the rest of the process anyway.

Instead of giving to your employer your bank account, you will give the bank details assigned to your Bitwage account. For the employer will be the same bank transfer, for you will be a huge difference. In you bitwage account you could setup later how to receive your income, how much % in fiat to your normal bank account and how much % in BTC to your BTC wallet. You better choose 100% to BTC.

**This is a warning!**  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
You have been warned! Do not come back here and complain about Coinbase, we are not here to see/fix their shit, post on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase if you have a problem with them, it is NOT our problem.  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

STOP recommending to noobs that shit! You are making a huge de-favor to yourself by doing that.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.  
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.

I was mining years ago, with GPUs and USBs. Mining like that it's over.  
Now I work and be paid in BTC. Easy peasy if you start by using Bitwage.com until your employer get BTC to pay you.  
I pay the rent in BTC too. Convincing the landlord was easier than the employer.  
There are many places that already accept BTC, you just have to dig a bit and be patient. I found merchants that didn't want to make public that they accept BTC but when I asked them if I can pay with BTC, they just sent me a BTC address to pay. If there is really a merchant that I have to buy from and is impossible to pay with BTC, I just use one of the many services that pays bills for you and you give them BTC.  
[Here is a small list of merchants (including food)](  
and here is a list of bills payments:  
 - receive salary in BTC  
 - pay bills - EU  
 - pay bills - EU  
 - pay bills in PL  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills - EU, maybe CA, US, MEX  
 - EU  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills - CA  
 - pay bills, get wages - AUS

 - pay bills, receive wages, recharge phones credit - PH  
 - pay bills etc - PH  
 - pay bills Thailand - TH

I am not the owner of the site or any involvement into that project. I post the link because few people know that there is a place where are listed so many wallets, with characteristics and features explained in some sort. It's just a start, later each one can dig more and make his own decisions. Just pointing the noobs to one or two wallets only is really dumb, people should make their own choices based on their habits, usage, preferences. We have many wallets now, not like in 2010 :)

I don't want to defend Bitstamp, but most of the complaints are users mistakes. Let's not forget that Bitstamp is a regulated exchange and they have to comply the AML rules. Many people just send/withdraw tons of shitload of fiat and do not read FAQs. That's why they get burned.  
And yes, for more and more people using Bitstamp will collapse their system. Any abuse have consequences. People should spread their exchanges use.  
So far Bitstamp is a good and honest player. Let's hope will continue like that.

If you bought BTC just with the idea of selling them to get rich now in worthless goat shit fiat, then sell them now and don't look back again nor forward, just spend your tons of shit fiat now and cry later.  
[Before selling, you should read more about Bitcoin and what really is. Start with this](  
For a person that want to be free and protected from the evil banksters and their hand (govs), Bitcoin is the best weapon. Govs/banks know that and will try everything possible for them to diminish the use of Bitcoin. By HODLing and not selling we slow down this trend until our lovely devs will come up with more solutions to fight against fiat and became totally free of fiat.

Yes totally agree with you, Bitstamp is one of the good example in Bitcoin ecosystem.  
But concentrating all noobs into there (same mistake like with Coinbase) will end up in fucking Bitstamp too.  
Let's make it clear for all noobs: there are different ways just to acquire BTC and each one of you should do his homework.  
1. **Bitcoin trading platforms** - all those big exchanges where big players are just playing with the BTC price and lots of money. As noob don't go there, you will get burned. All these are mainly controlled by banksters and hedge funds.  
You just want to get some BTC in the end, don't start trading. First you need to know more about BTC not gambling.  
On these platforms the access is heavily registered and controlled. The BTC obtained from there definitely you need to shapeshift it.  
2. **Bitcoin centralized exchanges** - all those small and medium exchanges that want some pieces of the Bitcoin pie. They will squeeze you for fees and markups. If you don't care about the price, fine, buy from them, but take out your BTC immediately to your own wallet.  
On these platforms the access is heavily registered and controlled. The BTC obtained from there definitely you need to shapeshift it.  
3. **Bitcoin P2P centralized exchanges** - all those that put in contact all buyers and sellers but they use a central platform, also used as escrow mediator. These are good places, prices can't be so much manipulated and the volume is REAL, people really put their money in orders, there is no way to be fake orders (like on trading platforms) or fractional reserves.  
On these platforms the access need registration for protecting against scams. The BTC obtained from there definitely you need to shapeshift it because is linked with your real name.  
4. **Bitcoin P2P decentralized exchanges** - the best, secure, private way to get some BTC. No registration, no need to shapeshift, only if you really want full anonymity. Yes the process of buying/selling on these platforms is slower than any of previous ones, but is real, with real people, real orders. And is clean. People don't use (yet) too much these exchanges because they get into this crazyness of "trading" BTC to get rich quick. No, if you just want to get some BTC in a clean way, use P2P decentralized exchanges.  
5. **Be paid in BTC** - Yes, there is another way to just get BTC without passing by all these methods mentioned before. And this section also could be slit in 2 ways:  
- **Use Bitwage.com** so your employer (thatr still doesn't have BTC) will just make the usual bank transfer for your salary, but not directly to your bank account but to your Bitwage account. Bitwage will just convert for you the fiat into BTC and send it to your own wallet. Not even need to keep the BTC in your Bitwage account, so full control of your money, no need to have a bank account. You can even split your income in % of fiat and BTC (if you don't want to keep all in BTC). You would say "but I want some fiat to pay may bills", [there are many services that I posted here]( that can do that for you, pay bills with your BTC directly.  
- **Use a direct BTC payment**, convince your employer to buy BTC as reserve currency for the company and pay you from that reserve in BTC, wallet to wallet. Is the best way to obtain BTC.  
[Here is a list of exchanges]( (including Bitstamp) so choose the one is more appropriate for your habits or use 2-3 more, spread your buys.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:32:54
But they are not the ones paying the fees! Only if they use an intermediary like Bitpay or Coinbase, but that is really "not accepting" BTC.  
Any merchant that accept BTC just to convert them into fiat again, is a loser and that is not acceptance.  
Any merchant that accept BTC and pay his employees or suppliers with BTC, or just HODL those BTC, is a real "acceptant", a real bitcoiner.

Bitcoin IS NOT Coinbase, damn it!  
**This is a warning!**  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters (BBVA) and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**

You have been warned! Do not come back here and complain about Coinbase, we are not here to see/fix their shit, post on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase if you have a problem with them, it is NOT our problem.  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

LOL true, sounds terrible :)  
Maybe I didn't express correctly but I think you get the point. Coinbase is playing with users money.  
I said "semi-fractional reserve" because in fractional reserve the bank have to keep a specific amount as "reserve" and the rest lend it endlessly. In coinbase case is a bit different but is following the same scenario and will end in the same result: people get burned.  
So people should ask themselves these questions:  
- is there a public resource where users can see the same volume of "trading" as the volume put in trade by the users of Coinbase, separate of the volume of hodling wallets, just users that want to trade?  
- is there a proof that all bitcoins bought by users are real traded bitcoins, sent to the market by users?  
- is there a proof that a BTC that you just bought on Coinbase and appear into your Coinbase wallet is a real BTC, with tx appeared in the Bitcoin blockchain?  
- why on Coinbase wallet is never appeared a real BTC address, verifiable on the blockchain, when you deal with txs between Coinbase users?  
And many other questions... regarding "not your keys, not your bitcoins".

Coinbase is using a some kind of fractional reserve with BTC. You give them money they give you BTC IOUs.  
You will never see the Coinbase wallet address on public blockchain, that means you see them in your Coinbase but doesn't exist! Is just a promise of BTC. Coinbase is just playing you.
Coinbase is the biggest scam ever!

Sorry to ruin your buttcoining.  
I live only with BTC from 2015. I am paid in BTC for my work, I spend all my regular expenses in BTC (mainly because I closed all my bank accounts).   
Yes could be hard because of fees but in my case I have a lot of BTC mined, bought, earned in early years (2012-2015) so doesn't affect me too much. Even if will affect me, I am willing to pay this temporary price (until LN is ready) for my freedom. Being free from banksters slavery feels very good.  
I spend my BTC on many places online, if some merchants still doesn't accept BTC I use services like bitwala to pay bills, invoices etc.  
I pay my rent in BTC because I convinced the landlord to accept it.  
I pay for gas to a local station.  
I pay my groceries to  a local shop that accept it. But there are now many others accepting BTC online too.  
I pay taxes **for what income in fiat I declare**. Tax form is not in BTC so why should I declare my BTC stash? Bitcoin is not money right? :)  
My income salary is already taxed before I get BTC, so why should I pay more taxes for something I was already taxed?  
You have to be a a really idiot to go to your taxman and say, hey you see I get "capital gains" so please tax me for that. **I do not sell for fucking fiat my BTC!** So they get NOTHING.  


Yes always goes up for several years, so my private pension fund in BTC goes higher and higher.  
r/LivingOnBitcoin is real even if you will deny it. Why? Because there are every day more and more people that start dumping fiat and get rid of banksters...

Yes, your funds will be locked in an escrow wallet until the tx is done - but is decentralized.  
Yes, you have to give your bank details to the other party in the exchange (and only to that one) - but is decentralized.  
Yes, the rates ar not like on Bitstamp, Coinbase Bitfinex or whatever other (manipulated) exchange, are the REAL rates that REAL people want to buy/sell - but is decentralized.  
Yes, you have to load the app on your computer and you have to check most of the time if your order is taken - but is decentralized.  
Yes, there are many things to improve in this P2P exchange - but is decentralized.

If you want to go full on BTC, do like me.  
In 2015 I start being paid in BTC, by using Bitwage, then few months later I start being paid in BTc wallet2wallet.  
I closed all my bank accounts, first because I didn't want to use anymore fiat, to push myself to go full BTC. Then because I hate banksters!  
I start looking to pay all my expenses directly into BTC. Yes I used that time Xapo card, it was great but wasn't what I wanted, full BTC.  
So I convinced my landlord to pay him the rent in BTC. Done.  
So I convinced a local grocery to accept my BTC. Done. Now I get 10-20% discount paying with BTC.  
So I convinced a local gas station to take my BTC. Done.  
I start using [services like Bitwala]( to pay my bills and shit. Also sometimes when I need to buy something online and they don't accept BTC, I use bank transfer option and get their bank details to pay with services like Bitwala, using my BTC directly.  
I start looking for many merchants that accept BTC and start saving those links. [An example here](  
Finally r/LivingOnBitcoin is real (not just another sub) even if there are many that will downvote those who said that.  
If you want to live on BTC, start with your local community, convince them to use BTC, make meetups and discuss things about BTC and how Bitcoin can fix "problems". If BTC can't fix some, don't use it only because you want to use it. There will be time for all, soon. Make small steps, but steady.

That bank is a real Bitcoin lover :) They make you a big fucking favor!  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.  
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.

That's total BS.  


In the past I used also those cards loaded through BTC, but I dump them after few uses. Going back to fiat is not the option. Maybe for you until you get more around you to accept BTC.  
If your landlord still do not want your BTC (I really doubt that if he is a smart person) tell him that you will move to another one that accept. Before saying that be sure you already find one. There are many that will be happy to take BTC. Check this one  definitely you will find an owner that take BTC.  
Is not easy to make this step, but if you really are determined to make this step, will be huge for your future. Who is preparing now for the future will have many gains. The future is Bitcoin for sure.

**This is a warning!**  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.

What about them?  
90% of taxes goes on politicians, corruption, wars, favors etc and the rest goes to community.  
There are many other ways to fund schools, roads, hospitals and no need for forced taxation.  
What about these, when will stop paying tribute to the masters, then we will start paying voluntary taxes for roads and hospitals etc. But until we will not have these kind of "expenses" with our money, why we should pay taxes?  
We are tired of paying taxes (aka tribute) to the masters that just:  
- lost [9 trillions from FED]( (also our taxes)  
- lost another 6.5 trillions in [military funding](  
- lost track of [Irak war billions](  
- lost track another [trillions on 9/11](  
- [all taxes goes to military complex]( - how many roads, hospitals, schools etc can be built with these trillions?    
- pay taxes to [fund these military police that kill civilians instead of protecting them](  
[- pay taxes so the gov can tax me rain water and ponds on my property?](  
- pay taxes to build railroads [that later GM dismantle them to push their agenda of heavy use of cars](  
This list is even larger than you can imagine.  
And people still pay taxes like nothing happen, thinking that is for common good...  
Enough is enough, with my btc will never fund a war or a corrupt politician.

CB vault is useless, like any other "vault" services. Will not help you in any way that vault if they will close the access to your bitcoins. Actually anything you have on Coinbase account IT IS NOT yours anymore.  
Also the CB practice to trace, seize, close, give away your personal info, make them a REAL STAY AWAY.  
The price for convenience is too high compared with the price of financial privacy,  that is far more important than convenience.  
People are giving up too easy their rights and info. They are the product not the customer anymore...

Slowly people will realize the power of being **decentralized**...  
When govs/banksters will go after all "regulated" exchanges you will see that people will wake up and go for P2P exchanges.  
Now, people are used to give up their rtights and privacy for convenience of those "regulated" exchanges, but they will cry later for that decision.  
You can see it clearly that EU people are more concerned about their privacy than US people:

Bitsquare is quite young, it born in April 2016 I think. Wait to see whan govs will go after "regulated" exchanges, many will close, many will adopt drastic rules for AML/KYC and many people will wake up and start looking for P2P exchanges like bitsquare. Then the volume on P2P will skyrocket, not only for the fiat/btc but also for the altcoins/btc, for shapeshifting...

The thing is not how much you have today, but is that you always have to think that in the near future how much you will be willing to pay for only 1k satoshis... will be veeery expensive.  
And we are still very few that really knows about BTC, imagine when the rest of the planet will realize what really IS Bitcoin, how will explode....  
Remember this: **NEVER SELL**. Use BTC to buy stuff when the price is up, then buy back +10% more and if you catch a drop better.  
Even if you see the price dropping to 600-500-100... **NEVER SELL**!

Just always buy, NEVER sell! Use BTC as money, because it is the real money!  
Fiat is already worthless goat shit, not worth it to sell your valuable BTC for shit. In the day when fiat be obsolete, you will cry for your BTC that you sold for worthless IOUs and/or you will pay a huuuge price just for some satoshis.  
**People should understand once and for all: this is NOT a quick profit race for worthless fiat goat shit! This is a race to secure your future with BTC, because there will come one day that you will not have it and everything will be based on BTC**

The best way will be a P2P decentralized exchange like Bitsquare.io. I heard there are many others like that. Or local trader from Mycelium wallet.  
Today we are giving up too many information that we will regret it later.  
Is not enough that you are moving your btc from CB account. They already have your info. You will need also to shapeshift your bitcoins, but even then, who knows what they will gonna do later?

2 - I recovered my financial privacy, closed my bank accounts, I am my own banker now. Bitcoin can restore many of our many lost freedoms and empower the individual

You are welcome to create a P2P decentralized platform like bitsquare, but for lending, that is charging a very small fee, just to maintain the future developing/fixes of the platform.  
We need more innovations and products like this. I shared this link not to make them known or push people to use it, but as an interesting idea and show that we already have other ways than traditional banking.

3. Mycelium: can pay fiat bills through cashila plugin. Airbitz: don't, only gift cards and bitrefill  
4. Mycelium: buy BTC from local trader, Glidera and CC. Airbitz: only Glidera

Each 2FA account (key) was generated based on a QR code or a text key. Those are the ones you should save.  
If you have 1 2FA for your google email, 1 for your BTC exchange, 1 for your whatever other account, you need to save for each one the originated QR code or text key. So you have to go to those accounts and generate them again and save them first.

If you compare the markets between USD/EUR/CAD you will see the difference:  
  
  
  
And that's because EU is not trusting so much the "regulated" exchanges. In EU we like to be free :)  
Bitsquare is not (yet) for trading, is just for buying secure and private, P2P some BTC and/or trade with altcoins.  
Let's be clear: **Bitsquare is P2P decentralized exchange**, maybe people do not understand those words.  
And another point to be mentioned here: on bitsquare NOBODY can manipulate the price, because it is P2P, real persons are making the offers and they cannot fuck with those orders or stupid bots or some kind of banksters behind those orders.  
Today, on 90% of all other exchanges that are not P2P, the price is manipulated even by the exchanges themselves. Why?! Because they want your money!  
Check also bitcoin.de, another P2P exchange, but this one is centralized. Even then the price is driven by users themselves...

- lost track another [trillions on 9/11](  
- [funding military complex]( 
- [fund these military police that kill civilians instead of protecting them](   
- [HSBC - funding drug cartels](  
- [Wells Fargo scam](

Once more and more people will wake up and see that they were fooled by banksters into a modern slavery, they will not use their "services" anymore. Services like  will boom in the next years.

- write down on paper the passphrase  
- write down/save on a text file some of the BTC addresses generated (for later deposit)  
- boot again Tails, test the passphrase (**a must rule**)  
- encrypt that passphrase using steganography into a nice image  
- post that image on your website or other website, or a store it together with your family pictures, on a digital frame, on a usb stick, on a DVD or whatever medium of storage with quick access  
- make a backup by inserting the passphrase words into a nice phrase text and save it in some places where you can see it freely anytime, anywhere (a web, an email, a text message, a postcard whatever)  
Be inventive in hiding your passphrase. You can use even  for making harder.

I hope that many here will learn the lesson about using "regulated" and centralized exchanges.  
This was a total attack by the banksters to not let the BTC price to go up and scare people....  
**The solution is right on your hand: P2P decentralized exchanges like Bitsquare.io** - nobody will steal your passwords/wallets/cryptos. You are **always** in control of your identity/money. No more AML/KYC and gov/banksters tracking.

By writing "BitCoin" and not Bitcoin shows enough about how much you know about this stuff...  
Also the use of the word "vault", in Bitcoinlandia doesn't have the effect like on Fiatlandia. It's useless. We all have own "vaults" in many forms.  
Your "vaults" are not helping in any way to keep my BTC safe if you can close the access to that vault in any moment? Because that vault is a centralized storage and is not helping in any way.

Actually (sad) is that these kind of bad miners are profiting from bugs in the protocol, that looks like devs do not want to fix it. This problem is for years not just now.

I tried to avoid crowded days of mempool, but I never made a sum up for the fees. You don't have to do this everytime immnediatelly after you receive the btc. You can even wait few days until the exchange rate for altcoins is better and you can even make some profit. Yes in general the price of altcoins is going down, but due to the fact that I never keep altcoins, I just use them, the lowering rate of altcoins is not afecting me too much, but sometimes I have profit that covers the fees. I also have some online mining contracts that still gives me some satoshis to cover my fees.  
So in the end I never be in loss :)  
I'm not saying that my method is the best, but is a the way I lose track of my coins and for almost 5 years of using BTC, NOBODY can identify a BTC address with my real name.

Or do you remember how was to send a picture of you attached to an email? Maybe hours...  
So Bitcoin is also in that phase now...  
Yes, Bitcoin network is having some problems today, but that doesn't mean we will not fix them. These problems come mainly from many manipulations of community and most of them from the same banksters that hate Bitcoin.  
So patience and meanwhile, buy BTC at steady pace and never sell. Soon all problems will be solved.

Please don't post your ignorance here. You have been warned so many times about Coinbase and you still ignored the warnings. Now you pay the consequences and we are not here to fix that.  
I really hope this will wake up more people that still ignore the warnings!  
This is not FUD, this is nothing against the people that work in Coinbase, this is a warning about the "people" behind the strings of Coinbase (banksters from BBVA/IRS). Coinbase continuously fuck the users and they have a huge army of shills to push more new users to their "services". But all those new users don't know the real risks of using Coinbase...  
This is like we are warning a young boy NOT to go to that "pretty lady" because he will have gonorrhea after that and will be really bad. But yet he let her fuck him hard and gave him gonorrhea... Only after that he will learn the lesson.

Understand for fuck sake! I can't use my BTC to buy bread and live free. I have to go back to fiat always and **I don't want to use fiat anymore**!  
Paying those insane fees makes Bitcoin impractical as money. We need P2P money not another "thing" to speculate the price market! I don't really care how much worth BTC in fiat today or tomorrow. I want to have a currency that I can use freely not forcibly by any gov or other intermediary.

Please do not convert r/bitcoin into the shit fan of Coinbase/GDAX. We all know that they are shit and they do not care about Bitcoin. But we don't have to see almost every day a complain about that shit company.

We warned here so many times about Coinbase that I really get tired saying it.

@_date: 2017-03-07 13:26:56
Yes but right now Bitcoin is NOT working as it was "promoted". So is quite useless to fight against banksters. We need a decentralized currency that works and that can slap in the face the banksters fedcoin.  
With these insane fees and long time confirmations is not practical.  
People needs the currency first not the store of value. The store of value come later.  
We need to trade freely first and then we can focus on how to store value. Otherwise we are just continuing to be slaves to the masters...  
Bitcoin doesn't help me to be free from the banksters if I have to go back and use their worthless shity fiat.  
How will help me to live free, if I have stored my wealth in BTC (store of value) but I cannot trade freely with another decentralized currency? Gov will seize/close/track/spy anyway my financials even if I have stored BTC.  
Bitcoin needs to be fixed/upgraded and fast...  
I am a big HODLer from 2012 but I want to use my BTC like money first. To get rid of all those bansksters fucks.

My income is only in BTC so I always shapeshift my coins.  
  
  
  
  
Example:  
- send 1 BTC from the income address, split into 3-4-5 txs for 3-4-5 altcoins  
- wait 1-2 days or see how the altcoins market goes to make some small profit or cover the fees with the price moves  
- sell those shitcoins for BTC in other 2-3 txs to different BTC addresses.  
- never link your IP/identity with the txs  
Until will be a real good service to mix your coins, this is a good solution. I think Samourai wallet is working on a coinjoin feature.

We understand you. Me myself I was in this kind of forced situation to sell few years ago and I was crying not to sell.

Did you tried to explain to those unbanked from African countries, South America, Asia etc why they can't be banked with Bitcoin and pay for fees with the cost of their meal for 2-3 days?  
If Bitcoin will not be used to pay your beers useless. VISA or other "traditional" payments can do that very well.  
But people forget **WHY** Bitcoin was created/invented: **to have a fucking P2P decentralized currency** that will  let people transact P2P freely and without any intermediary.  
If in time Bitcoin wil get more value, fine, but people need more than anything, now, a REAL p2P money not a store of value shit that can be speculated on the market.  
There are billions of people with no access to a financial system.   
Why always we have to think only for the fancy hipsters in NY that want to pay their beer with BTC?!  
Why we forget the poor farmer in Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, Thailand, Camerun, Nigeria etc that want to sell his products to other people, fast, easy, with no intermediary, no gov that will seize his account, no political pressure etc.  
I suggest to all those that are praising high tx fees to watch [this short documentary on how to live a month in a South American country with only $1/day]( How you are gonna explain Bitcoin to these people that they need a currency like Bitcoin, that they have to pay a fee that can buy their daily meal...

Or just tell to your employer to pay you using bitwage.com or other service like that.  
If you don't have a job, do this:  
- instead of drinking 6 beers/day, drink only 3  
- save the money for 3 beers/day  
- end of the month, with those saved money, buy BTC, at whatever price  
- repeat this a whole year  
- NEVER SELL, just occasionally if you have enough BTC to buy beers (only 3) with BTC  
- if you spend BTC, buy back +10% more

The first sentence of Satoshi papers said: "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."  This is what we need. Not another fancy intermediaries...  
I want to control MY MONEY, I don't want discounts, I don't want another bloodsuckers around my transactions, I want to pay the recipient directly with no other party involved.  
When we trade in gold coins, long time ago, there were no "purse" or "credit cards", was just a pure P2P trade with REAL money.  
Of course I am complaining about the miners, but who let the miners to do what they are doing now? Devs.  They knew what happen for years but they didn't changed the code.  
Now we are in the situation when miners act like banksters...  
**I don't care what will be the "fix" for Bitcoin situation (BU, segwit, LN, whatever), I want Bitcoin to function like it was promoted: pure P2P money**

Useless. Meaningless. Missing other languages.  
I f I will contract some 1000 bangladesh people to make 1000 searches/pers/day for "buy bitcoin" that doesn't mean there is a huge "trend" in buying bitcoin or that Bitcoin is doing great.  
If we want to see how is the adoption of the real trend, we should look to how many new merchants are announcing their BTC acceptance, how many companies start paying in BTC. That is the real trend not BS google searches.  
BTW... less and less people are using google to search things and also those who still use it are using secured/hidden/encrypted searches that are not contained in that "trend".

WP + Woocommerce + Bitcoinway.com plugin + your electrum wallet works great. No fees, you control your money/addresses, 5 min setup, free/paid version of the plugin.  
Also you can create your Open Bazaar shop and post the link to it on your existing ecommerce site for those who want to pay with btc (this could be in case you don't want/can't use a WP site or you don't want to change your existing site).  
Once you have done the btc payment method, you should list your shop on coinmap.org and spendabit.co  
If you create an OB shop, you will be listed automatically on   
If you want a more personalized solution you can contact a developer and pay him/her in BTC:

Nope. Only if you made changes like changing your password, create new btc addresses.  
If you recover an old wallet.dat, you will wait until is resynced with all your latest txs and done.
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:10:08
You can use/receive txs on any of your addresses, no matter were used or not. That "used" selection is just a way to organize your addresses.  
In Electrum also if you want to use only a specific address to spend, go to menu, wallet - coins, right click on the address you want and select spend. So the new tx will use that specific address to spend coins. Same if you want more than 1 address, select more addresses and click from them - spend.

It's a feature, a principle, a fight against banksters. If you sell you make the banksters game. I don't. NEVER!  
People should always remember a fact: Bitcoin was created/invented to fight against the evil banksters. By selling it today or tomorrow just to "stop loss" or make some bunch of fiat money, you are just give up in front of the machinery of banksters, you go back to slavery.  
For more you HODL/USE BTC as money and NOT use banksters fiat, you slowly win the freedom fight! This makes crazy all the banksters because they want you to be a slave forever to their fiat shit.

Is OK if you do this:  
1. export your mycelium private keys  
2. import them into electrum  
3. make a copy of the electrum wallet for both chains  
4. point/connect your electrum wallet to any of your nodes core or bu (if you have your own nodes)  
5. open your electrum bu wallet pointed to a bu node  
6. **sell all those new shit-altcoins for BTC in whatever exchange you want**  
7. open your electrum BTC pointed to your Core node, generate new address  
8. move those BTC you newly bought  with the BTU altcoins to your electrum wallet  
This is how you double your BTC in simple moves.  
EDIT: I think you can even use the passphrase from Mycelium to Electrum. Not sure if is compatible with the new versions but I know that in the past was.

So why my gov should know when, where, from who I buy bread? Financial privacy is a right, not a privilege only for banksters...  
I will remind you again the first phrase of Satoshi papers: **"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."**  
That first thing, today it is not working:  
- I have to wait until a miner will accept my fee and then wait until will include it into a block  
- I have to pay an insane fee when with a min fee will be enough if the protocol will be fixed in some way  
- I have to go back to fiat (intermediary) to be able to buy something

Yes I agree, the spam should be taken down. Me myself sometimes I report something that is not right (see that guy that over the last months is posting over and over about making money with trading, same post same shit).    
But banning a site just because is giving some shits to users is useless.  
BTW this post wasn't against reddit or mods or something like that. I was just wanted to point that in the last days there were a lot of posts trying to manipulate the price, the faith, the conscience, everything. It was like raining with shit post. And many people do not pay too much attention to these details.

I really get very suspicious to use a wallet as exchange with all my personal info stored "somewhere".  
I keep using decentralized exchanges and move the btc to my "unknown" personal wallet addresses. Also shapeshifting if some tx is linked with my real info details.  
A wallet as exchange is really dangerous:  
- will always know your real IP/location  
- will always know your real identity, later they will force all wallet providers to apply for AML/KYC and you are fucked.  
- will always know how much you bought, move, movements to other addresses etc  
- can be forced anytime to give up your details.  
**I will never give up my info the gov assholes!**   
Wallet providers should focus on **how to make easy to spend** BTC not to buy and features with merchants, to make easier for merchants to find BTC users. Promotions, discounts, merchant lists, maps etc.  
**To be clear: I never bought and will never buy from a wallet. At least should prove it that is a P2P decentralized wallet/exchange! I do not trust anymore a wallet that will ask my personal info!**  
**Financial privacy is A RIGHT and we should defend it as we defend our free speech right!**

That's why I strongly recommend to use P2P exchanges, where the possibility of manipulations is very hard/almost impossible to achieve.

Many people have the impression that IF will be a HF for Bitcoin, will be same scenario like ETH/ETC. **They are wrong**. Will not be the same. Is not the same situation here.  
Let's be clear: this is not a fork, this is a hold up... so guess what happen with those that want to steal the bank (actual blockchain): the money that they think they steal (aka BTU) are fake/worthless in the first day. Because the bank declare them out of circulation. So everybody that's will get those money will find out that worth nothing. So everybody will try to get rid of them immediately. Once we dump them, nobody will accept them anymore. **Useless**

**Fuck them!** The world will be much better without those bloodsuckers.  
Remember WHY Bitcoin was invented? The first sentence from Satoshi papers: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
For more time we still use the banksters tools like plastic cards, for more we remain in the agony and enslavement. We have to cut the crap ASAP no matter hard would be.

My first purchase was in Dec 2012, from a friend that was mining. He said to me: buy 1 BTC from me I will give it for less than the market price is, buy it for your daughter. I still have it, in my daughter's wallet. That one will be her future.  
I was continuing to buy and store in her wallet.  
No matter the price was, I was never tempted to sell. Because in that day of Dec 2012 I realized that this is the future, the future of my daughter.  
Yes I was once, like you, forced to sell, because I had some extra big not expected expenses. But you know what I did? Went to a bank I took a credit, paid the expenses in fiat, but didn't sell my BTC. Then next year I worked hard and paid with BTC that credit. Every day for less BTC. Yes is hard NOT to sell when you are pressed. But you have to be strong.  
As I said, I understand your frustration. In the end this is life and as you said, now you remain with the other half for free practically.

If you mine altcoins with minergate.com then exchange them for BTC, maybe you get some good amount.  
Minergate works nice with changelly.com exchange, using the same email you use in minergate. Send the altcoins mined, to the exchange, using the invoice system and get instant BTC (not really instant, depending on the tx process).  
Works, confirmed.

I changed that thought back in 2012 when I bought my 2nd BTC, immediately after the 1st. My new thought was how to live only with BTC and dump fiat once and for all.  
Until 2015 I bought (at whatever price), mined, played faucets, sell some stuff, work for BTC, but NEVER SELL my BTC, yes sometimes use them to buy stuff.  
And in 2015.... I closed all my bank accounts and start living ONLY with Bitcoin! My dream come true.  
Yes, IS REAL. First step to achieve that is to take out from your mind the fiat and the desire to make "huge money" selling BTC.  
Right now I just sit, [eat my HODLCORNs]( and laugh to all those concerned about price movements, ETF, NIRP, forks shits etc. Life is much easier and free without fiat and bank accounts.

You should remove the user votes and keep it simple and just present the facts/features of each. User opinion is highly manipulative and misleading. I just voted 3 times for the same exchange in different ways. And is not true opinion. I can vote every day or every hour the same exchange and that doesn't mean the exchange is good. But still people **always** choose the most voted because they **always** think that is good, but in fact is NOT...  
Leave the exchanges in alphabetical order and focus on mentioning as much as you can their features. Leave the users to decide for themselves which is better for them.

Banksters know that they can't stop Bitcoin so they will do all tricks to keep you using their slavery money fiat/fedcoin so they can control you. They don't care if you use BTC as digital gold/store of value as far they can control the friction points (exchanges, ETF etc).   
ETF is just another IOU like fiat, a promise.  
Bitcoin is based ONLY on ownership: you don't own the keys you don't have the bitcoins, you own the keys, it is your BTC.  
Also, in the actual state of BTC network this ETF will do only damage to the network. If they will start bombarding with lots of orders of buying/selling this ETF, lots of them will create mempool congestion again and again, raising fees astronomically, network collapse, users pissed off they will move out. Price will crash even lower than $600. The perfect plan to bring down Bitcoin, organized by the banksters.  
If segwit and LN will not be activated this ETF is the nail in the coffin for Bitcoin.  
**Bitcoin cannot survive if it is not used as MONEY!** Bitcoin doesn't make sense to be only store of value. Will be another tool to control the slaves.  
Bitcoin needs to be decentralized P2P money, otherwise we go back to the master/slave relationship...  
Mark my words, this will gonna happen. I know I will get lots of downvotes for this, because there are more than 80% users here that only want to speculate with BTC, they don't want to help BTC go forward and not being a slave to the masters. Many people here ARE NOT REAL BITCOINERS...

Warning about Coinbase is NOT negativity. Is just a warning. Many people break their necks with Coinbase just because many as you "recommend" it. Bitcoin is not limited only to Coinbase... and BTW Coinbase was created/funded by banksters, is a trojan horse, tracking absolutely everything.  
If you are OK to use that banksters tool and be fucked by them, it's your problem, but at least do not push others to that shit, many don't know the risks and maybe they don't want to take those risks.

Import that mycelium wallet into electrum using the passphrase you saved. When you import check the option bip39 in the passphrase window. Then you wait a bit to sync all your txs and you will be able to manage all your btc addresses from that mycelium wallet.  
Sometimes mycelium is not syncing all the txs due to lack of space on your mobile or too much cache trash. You can delete your wallet from your mobile and restore it again or just clean your cache.  
btw the wallet continue to work on both apps, mycelium and electrum.  
If you use that wallet/address for faucets, I recommend you to move to a storing address all those small amounts in one big tx to a new address (preferably in electrum). Then change your address for faucets.  
Bitcoin - be your own bank also imply to make your clean up in your addresses.

So what? ETFshit have nothing to do with Bitcoin and Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck about ETF.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:52:10
Is not. The bank account is NOT in your name. So the employer is paying to Bitwage account and Bitwage is giving you BTC. So you are paid in BTC not in fiat.  
So your paycheck is already taxed when your employer is releasing it to Bitwage. Moving to your BTC wallet from Bitwage will not be taxed again, like Coinbase/IRS tried to do it.  
Also you are protected from [exchanges "glitches"]( and you will always have BTC at a fair price with no hassle.  
Next step? Ask your employer to pay you directly in BTC. Problem solved forever.

If you look into email header you will see to which address they sent and also more details about the sender.  
Advice: always use an alias of your mailbox for all bitcoin sites, for each site a dedicated one. In this way not just you will know exactly who was the leaker but also you can block the spams by just deleting that alias.  
Be organized is the first step against scammers.

NO, that "vault" is just another way to fool you.  
How "safe" will be if you can't access that vault? What if CB will not let you access the vault? You are fucked anyway.
Coinbase is a bank, funded and created by the banksters (BBVA) and will always act like a bank (aka fuck you). 
You have been warned.  
There are tons of real wallets out there, that let you control 100% your keys, why people trust a fucking bank to keep their money?  
Remember the news about banks that open the clients safe boxes to confiscate what is inside? That will do CB also. Nothing will stop them to do that. Also you do not have any real proof that those BTC in the vault are on the real BTC blockchain, or just a sidechain of CB. another banksters trick: give you IOUs and they play with your real money.

I am paid in BTC, that was the most important thing to start. Then I convinced others to use BTC as money (my landlord, local grocery, local gas station, local bar) and start using services like cashila, bitwala, bitbill etc to pay other bills with BTC. Nowadays is quite easy to find an online shop that accept BTC for your needs.  
Everything start with our individual desire to get rid of fiat. I closed all my bank accounts once I realized I don't need anymore fiat. If people will not have this determination (to dump the fiat), Bitcoin will never go forward or will just became a new digital gold (and this can be a failure). Failure because govs and banks will be in control (again) on the pipelines (exchanges) that funnel the BTC.  
Bitcoin needs to be P2P money, as Satoshi design it otherwise could be a dangerous tool that can reverse the course to freedom.

I start buying (at any price), mining, earning, spending, hodling from then and forever.  
Finally in 2015 I start being paid in BTC so my dream come true: FUCK THE BANKS AND CLOSE ALL MY BANK ACCOUNTS.  
Yes, you are right, if you are not paid in BTC, is quite hard to start living only with BTC. But now there are many ways to get BTC from your wage: bitwage is great for that and they were my starting point to. I still use them with one of my clients.  
I don't have any bank account and I use only my BTC wallet. Yes, I'm not travelling too much and I buy from usual sources that accept BTC.  
If somebody wants to start living on Bitcoin will have a hard way, but that way is his own way and needs strong determination to do it: FUCK THE BANKS and their worthless goat shit that enslave the whole fucking planet.

Don't cry that in your area/town/country can't use your BTC wallet. The usage of BTC depends ONLY of YOU. You can make it happen not others.

Financial privacy is a right for all people not just a privilege for some banksters.  
Bitcoin empower each individual with this right. Now that an individual is dumb and link/publish all his BTC addresses that doesn't mean Bitcoin is not doing his work.  
When Andreas A. efined [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( he didn't refered only about the property of your BTC but also about your financial privacy. if you are dumb enough to use an online wallet or 3rd party custodial wallet, you are dumb enough to give up all your financial privacy to anybody else that can use it, not only govs.

If you buy BTC from a well regulated exchanges that already have your full identity and all your BTC wallets addresses, the authorities will well know all your moves and stash.

There is no such thing as "bitcoin debit card". Bitcoin CAN'T be debited. Bitcoin is OWNED (or not).  
A so called ["bitcoin debit card"]( is just another banksters trick to fool you to keep you using their worthless goat shit fiat!  
All these cards are a propaganda for using VISA. Satoshi created Bitcoin EXACTLY to get rid of these bloodsuckers!  
**Use your damn BTC wallet instead of all these bloodsuckers intermediaries.  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid these cards, don't be fooled again to go back to fiat.  
A reminder to all those that didn't read [Satoshi's papers]( the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Never forget this!  
Don't cry that in your area/town/country can't use your BTC wallet. The usage of BTC depends ONLY of YOU. You can make it happen not others.  
I live ONLY with BTC from 2015, but I never cry that is hard or difficult. I make it happen because I want it and because I hate so much the banksters!  
Satoshi gave us this wonderful and powerful tool to fight the banksters, it's our duty to continue his work, by using it as MONEY!  
Continuing to use fiat, you are giving up every day more freedom and rights and became more enslaved by the banksters.

My advice for all n00bs:  
- be aware of media manipulation, hype, shit throwing over Bitcoin. No matter how nice they speak about Bitcoin, they will always try to manipulate minds of those that still didn't read enough about Bitcoin and what really is. In my opinion almost 90% of all BTC actual users have NO IDEA about what really IS Bitcoin. They need to learn more and be protected against misinformation.  
A good start to read here:  or  or  then you can continue with more book, videos and texts, there are plenty on internet.  
- try to learn as much as you can HOW TO USE Bitcoin and wallets, before you start moving large amount of BTC. Use many wallets, learn them and stick with those which serve your habits and purposes. Be aware that there is "**no best wallet**" ever. There are only 2 main categories: those which respect [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( and those which ... don't. If you ignore this important rule you will lose. Categorically!  
Education is the key to success! ["Invest" in (your) education not in speculation!](  
- Try to minimize your use of plastic cards, bank accounts and depend too much of fiat. Start slowly to move towards Bitcoin and be part of r/LivingOnBitcoin. This is the first step to your total freedom from banksters slavery. Spend no more than you could live a normal life, the rest HODL for later.  
**May The Coin be With You!**

[The best example here]( I have a nice wallpaper in my living room containing a wallet passphrase embedded into that picture. NOBODY knows that contains more than 10BTC in there (I am adding every month some more). Yes, the picture is backed up in 2-3 other places, just in case the house is on fire. But I like to look at that nice picture, looking to my BTC... :)  
Hint: search for steganography  
Or just create a nice text, letter, containing your passphrase in a way that only you will know and post it on your website or any other online place (with backups of course). Nobody will figure out that you have hidden a wallet inside.

I live on BTC from 2015 and I am paid in BTC. In the beginning I used Bitwage too, is great, but now they pay me directly in BTC, to my wallet. Companies that I work with they are making capital reserves in BTC, not keeping money into a bank account anymore.  
I do not use any VISA card, I use directly my BTC wallet to shop/pay expenses. Yes I use services like bitwala to pay bills. But I never sell my BTC to get cash, actually I closed my bank accounts. Not used anymore.  
I pay tax for my work income (invoices, salaries), that's it. I declare what I bill/get not what I charge.  
I will never use a service like Coinbase, is well known taxman/banksters tool. Even if I see a merchant that uses Coinbase payment page I will cancel and never use that merchant again until they will fix the "problem".  
One thing: when you are paid in BTC, you should shapeshift your income. BTC income -&gt; altcoins -&gt; BTC (new many addresses). Is not good that you can be tracked starting from your employer.

Why always have to be Coinbase involved in a transaction as an intermediary?  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid any intermediary, as  [Satoshi's papers]( says: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
To accept/transact with BTC you don't need ANY intermediary!  
Why to buy BTC when we already have 18 millions of BTC in circulation? Ask to be paid in BTC and forget to buy. Spend in BTC and forget to buy. 
Today's exchanges are just for speculation, not to get into BTC. and yet are so many other exchanges that you really don't need to use that fucking Coinbase shit motherfuckers banksters!  
As I said so many times and I will repeat it again: **IF I WILL SEE A MERCHANT THAT USES COINBASE TO REDIRECT MY PAYMENT, I WILL CANCEL THAT PAYMENT AND NEVER USE THAT MERCHANT ANYMORE, UNTIL HE FIX THE DAMN SHIT!

Bitcoin doesn't need anything than just your "business" BTC wallet. Bitcoin was created/designed to not use any intermediary for a payment.  
Reminder from [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
If you have a physical store, is enough to train your employees to use a watch only wallet (you are the only one having the keys/passwords), they can take BTC but can't spend.  
Some interesting applications here:  
  
  
If you have just an online store, it's also easier, no need for any intermediary to manage your payments through BTC. There are plenty of solutions to integrate your own BTC wallet into your web. Start with Electrum, or WP+ WooCommerce + Bitway.com plugin or many others.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, act accordingly
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:56:25
Many wallets are already accessible. People have to make a small effort to change their way of thinking. Bitcoin was not invented so we can adapt it to existing systems. Bitcoin was invented to **CHANGE** all the existing systems, including the way we are thinking about economy, money, society, everything. Bitcoin is here to change the world we are living as we know it and that's why many people are afraid of it, because is changing them.  
People are afraid of big changes!  
Just by Bitcoin = Be your own bank... and many are scared out the shit of them... But this is the truth, we will be own bankers. But we have to act accordingly. Be more caution, secure yourself and your devices, invest in your tech education, read more, don't ignore the warnings just because to you still didn't happen x.

- there are many ways to deceive the thugs into a fake wallet with just some shits  
- the thugs, had mining equipment (found by police) but they never use it (it was stolen). If they knew WTF is BTC mining they will start mining and earn more than robbing people. But they don't so how the fuck they knew how to use private keys (supposedly given by the victim) to retrieve the BTC. I really doubt it  
- you have to be a real idiot to give up your BTC keys or let the rest of the world you have so much BTC

Coinbase is a bank and act like a bank: **is using a semi-fractional reserve with peoples money**.  
What you buy through their platform are not real BTC, are just IOUs. They never move BTC from public address x to y. They move it internally inside their own closed blockchain.  
In the moment you want to move out the BTC from your account, they put them into a public blockchain address and make the transfer.  
If you want to receive BTC (from any other wallet) into the same BTC address (supposedly) you already received from the CB exchange/buy. it is not possible, because that address doesn't exist in the public blockchain.  
I am very concerned that someday the "bubble" of Coinbase will explode [exactly how MtGox exploded](  
**Coinbase does NOT have any proof of stake of peoples money**

Definitely you need to read more about Bitcoin before writing that paper.  
Bitcoin will change totally the way we are get to use money until now (or how the banksters forced to use it).  
There will be no more debit/credit, but "you have the keys or not have the keys". Bitcoin is property and will end up all this shit of IOUs...

Because we need users EDUCATION and wallet devs to adapt fast to Bitcoin changes.  
I know many users that they never check the fee setup, don't even think about wtf is that.  
Wallet devs, please do something! We the HODLers we are willing to pay for extra effort in development but do something to end this nightmare!  
With few exceptions of hardcore BTC users, the rest of users are really ignorant with these things. Me personally I tried to educate as much as I could all my friends that uses BTC, but there are many more out there.

Yes I have some old friends (with lots of money) that I convinced them to get into BTC long time ago. The deal (they purpose) is that I keep them well informed about BTC and they pay me 20% of all their earnings from price difference every month. I have a quite steady income in BTC from that. Just being well informed and give the right TLDR to them.  
I do not want/take anything from any wallet provider/exchange/btc service, I want just good info not BS shills.

Dig deeper, there are options to do it with shopify, but pushing your customers to give up their financial freedom to Coinbase is not an option. They choose to pay with BTC exactly to avoid ANY intermediaries, you have to remember that and respect your customers choices.  
Electrum have a good documentation on how to build your own payment process page with BTC and your own wallet, with no intermediary.  
If not, better stick with fiat and cards and all be good. Customers will accept that. But do not lie to them. I choose to pay with BTC EXACTLY because it's P2P not P2B2P...

NO WAY! NEVER USE AGAIN FIAT!  
There is no such thing as "bitcoin debit card". [All those cards]( are just another banksters trick to fool the user to go back to use fiat. Those cards are fiat cards NOT BTC.  
Why should I go back to use fiat when I have my own BTC wallet?  
[Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Using those cards you violate the definition of Bitcoin, that means you are not using Bitcoin anymore. In the moment you supposedly load that card with fiat, by selling (giving away) your BTC, your BTC are not used anymore in a transaction to buy something. You use fiat. So we are back to the same shit.

Bitcoins are not stolen. Computers and mobiles are hacked, and not because the btc apps doesn't have enough security but because the users do not take enough precautions.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.

How many times we have to warn you people? What do you expect from a bank?    
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters (BBVA) and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
You have been warned!  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.

If I can "restore" my wallet without their services, then the question is WHY the fuck I have to use their "services" in the first place?  
A central authority that keeps my wallet will not help me in any way if they will cut my access to my wallet any time they want. So I would use their "services" if I know that they can do that and that will going to happen?  
Online wallet = bank. FUCK BANKS!

Bitcoin doesn't need ANY intermediary and in special Coinbase...  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
If I see a merchant that redirect my payment to a Coinbase or any other intermediary page, I will cancel it immediately and never use that merchant again, until they fix "the problem".  
Nowadays there are many ways to accept BTC on your website using some simple plugins or wallet APIs.

Nope. HODLing all my  BTC will not make them more valuable. Using them yes. I HODL only what I don't need to spend. Once I started to use BTC I realize one important thing: to save, to not spend money on things that I really don't need.

the wallets are just the interface app that gives you access to your bitcoins. Your bitcoins stays always on the blockchain, they never go away, they just change the owners of the keys to access them.  
Imagine you have like an old rusted key ring for dungeon (blockchain)  rooms (blocks) full with gold bars. Each key open a room door. If you have the right key to that room, you can enter and move the gold bars inside the dungeon but you can't take them out, just move from one room to another.  
Now, if you lose a key, you lose the access to your gold bars, forever.  
If you want to give to somebody some gold bars (bitcoins), you have 2 options: give him the key to that room, or use your key to take the gold bar and move it to his room (that he opens for you by giving you a public key, or to say a small hole where you could push inside the gold bar but you can't take it out).  
Now, imagine a software app that do all that described in matter of milliseconds.

Bitfinex was already.  
Coinbase is a bank and act like a bank: **is using a semi-fractional reserve with peoples money**.  
What you buy through their platform are not real BTC, are just IOUs. They never move BTC from public address x to y. They move it internally inside their own closed blockchain.  
In the moment you want to move out the BTC from your account, they put them into a public blockchain address and make the transfer.  
If you want to receive BTC (from any other wallet) into the same BTC address (supposedly) you already received from the CB exchange/buy. it is not possible, because that address doesn't exist in the public blockchain.  
I am very concerned that someday the "bubble" of Coinbase will explode [exactly how MtGox exploded](  
**Coinbase does NOT have any proof of stake of peoples money**  
Concentrating too many BTC users in the hands of Coinbase is exactly a repeated scenario of MtGox...

There is no such thing of "best wallet".  
There are ONLY 2 main categories of BTC wallets:  
- those which respect [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](  
- those which do not respect that rule  
Now inside these categories, you have [many types of wallets]( (mobile, desktop, paper/steel, hardware), choose the ones that fulfill your habits &amp; requirements. Do not use just one.  
That's why in Bitcoinlania we say Bitcoin = Be your own bank, act accordingly.

Your bitcoins will never "stay/store" on your device. They always sit nicely on the Blockchain. What you have on your mobile app is the key to access/use your bitcoins. It is a big difference.  
Keeping those keys ONLY on a mobile device you are about to lose all you have. Mobiles are for change, small amounts not all you have.  
I suggest to think about this distribution:  
- mobile app: small amounts, just for some beers or small shopping, daily usage  
- desktop app: medium amounts, for bills, medium shopping, not so often usage  
- HW wallet, paper/steel, steganography wallets: large amount of BTC, really just for storing

I have a very normal life. Yes, where I live I convinced many places to accept BTC (groceries, bars, gas station, pharmacy, landlord). We are a friendly community and we talk to each other. I started with small groups, meetings and discuss in serious terms about Bitcoin and how can help us in our community.  
Talking about is the key. Not just going to a shop and ask if they accept BTC. This is not the way to approach, each person have pro and contra points regarding Bitcoin, we have to find how BTC is helping each one of us.  
But we all have one thing in common: desire to (re)gain our financial freedom.

Coinbase IS already giving all data to IRS and other 3rd parties.  
What do you expect from a bank?    
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters (BBVA) and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
You have been warned!  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.

None. The only ones I would use will be the P2P ones, like [Bitsquare]( where the user data/money is NOT stored anywhere than local and between exchange order participants.  
Also in a P2P exchange the price CAN'T be manipulated because the orders for buy/sell are real and users can't fake them (like you usually see big walls that disappear instantly when is close).  
From 2015 I don't have to buy anymore BTC because I earn them, I am paid in BTC. I usually use P2P exchanges just to shapeshift my BTC.

For fiat, you can't have any proof that the $1 bill you have in your hands is real money or just an IOU paper. There0s nothing that can prove its value. Just politicians promises, that are every year changed....  
For Bitcoin, you have the blockchain, the birth/generation of 1 BTC, the use, the owners, everything, the whole history. And what is more important: it can't be changed!

Yes, take my example. I am paid in BTC from 2015, freelancing and also employee.  
I do the work, end of the month they have 2 options:  
- if they still no not have BTC, they pay my salary using bitwage.com (they send regular bank transfer in fiat, I receive BTC into my wallet)  
- if they have BTC, I just give them my BTC address (always a new one for each month) and they make the payment  
If I have to make an invoice for my services (freelancing) the invoice is in fiat and on the footnote I put : pay with BTC and get 10% discount, here is my address and QR code. I never give them any bank account because I don't have one in my name, I closed them all.

As I said many times here: **If I see a merchant that uses an intermediary like Coinbase, I will immediately cancel my order/payment and never use that merchant again, until they fix this problem.**  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid any intermediary, as  [Satoshi's papers]( says: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

P2P decentralized.  
Concentrating all BTC users in hands of few centralized exchanges and custodial wallets is the worst case scenario for Bitcoin...  
I don't have to start my exchange, is already done, bisq.network, a P2P decentralized exchange. People should look into that one more often. Will be more like this, soon.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:32:36
I don't use any other exchange to buy BTC because I don't need to. I am paid for my work in BTC so I don't have to buy anymore.  
But I still use instant exchanges for shapeshifting my btc income. That is a must when you have income every month in btc. Otherwise everybody will know your btc...

I live on BTC only from 2015 and i really don't care about BTC "volatility". Why? Because not BTC is volatile, is the fiat that actually fluctuates (aka going to be devaluated every day).  
For me BTC price always is going up from 2009 until now...

There is no such thing of "best wallet".  
There are ONLY 2 main categories of BTC wallets:  
- those which respect [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](  
- those which do not respect that rule  
Now inside these categories, you have [many types of wallets]( (mobile, desktop, paper/steel, hardware), choose the ones that fulfill your habits &amp; requirements. Do not use just one.  
For example:  
- keep spare change on mobile wallets (just enough to pay for a beer or small shopping)  
- keep medium amount on desktop wallets (just enough to pay monthly bills, expenses)  
- keep large amounts of savings (HODLing) on paper/steel, hardware wallets, steganography, something that you do not touch every day.  
**Don't forget to make backups to all these wallets and store those backups in many different places!**  
That's why in Bitcoinlania we say Bitcoin = Be your own bank, act accordingly.

Coinbase is a bank, funded, created and managed by the banksters (BBVA) and will always act like a bank (aka fuck you). Do you still trust a bank, even for a second?!

Not sure if your phrase is compatible with Electrum.  
Me personally I have an Mycelium wallet (12 words passphrase) "restored" into Electrum. I did this long time ago in previous version of electrum.  
Now I have same wallet working perfectly on both, Mycelium (mobile) and Electrum (desktop). For years never have a problem with syncing. And I use it quite a lot because I don't have bank accounts anymore, I live ONLY with BTC.

Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank, act accordingly.  
To accept BTC you don't need ANY intermediary. Your own BTC wallet is your own bank or payment platform.  
For your employees, they just have to handle a watch-only wallet and take payments. You keep the keys, they keep the QR codes for addresses you receive BTC.  
Always remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

Bitcoin doesn't need ANY intermediary as "payment processor". Bitcoin itself is the payment processor and the currency.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
If I see a merchant that redirect my payment to a Coinbase or any other intermediary page, I will cancel it immediately and never use that merchant again, until they fix "the problem".  
Nowadays there are many ways to accept BTC on your website using some simple plugins or wallet APIs. Do your research or ask for more information here.

@_date: 2017-11-15 19:54:48
licensed exchange = controlled by banksters, govs to be able to manipulate the price.  
I am concerned more about my privacy than the "volume of trading". For more volume it is, for more can be manipulated. I would like to see in every country a P2P decentralized exchange used by people, direct P2P, not a fancy "regulated and licensed" centralized exchange.

Just few words: Bitcoin is the best "protection" against divorces. There is no way for a lawyer or wife that could find your stash. Fuck them!  
EDIT: If your wife will know that you have BTC, maybe she will think twice if she want to divorce or not. She will get more money if she stays with you (spending your BTC), than trying to find where/how much you have, in a divorce (aka get shit). So during a "happy marriage" she will be "nice and friendly" with you, just enough to give her some satoshis... for the new shoes.

Yes I have many, but I didn't start buying lambos with it. I just live a simple life with what I have. I do not spend more then is needed. I work for pleasure and to help more people to get into Bitcoin.

Coinbase is a bank, funded, created and managed by the banksters (BBVA) and will always act like a bank (aka fuck you). Brian A is just a frontman. Their goal is NOT to help people to get into BTC, but to "study" them, track, list, pursue, create a pattern of linking BTC addresses, habits, monitor specific addresses. Everything is for a reason.  
Coinbase is the biggest exchange use because people are dumb and using it and they do not think before use. Everything is for a reason. They know that BTC can't be traced to every individual, but with majority of BTC users using Coinbase that is piece of cake.  
As I said many times: **if I see a merchant that redirect my payment to a CB page, I will cancel the payment and never use that merchant again** I do not want to link my BTC addresses in any way with CB.

- the privacy of your customers data  
- ability of your website to take many coins (aka 99% shitcoins)?  
Just think about these aspects:  
- you use a 3rd party to handle your payments (user data pass through this intermediary)  
- you use another intermediary to exchange the shitcoins into BTC, so another user data passing through another intermediary  
- who do you think will use all this data? (user IP, user coin addresses, user location, user name, user shopping etc) - not you but others.

Don't you see the perfect plan?  
Coinbase is a bank, funded and created by the banksters (BBVA) with the goal of registering, tracking, linking, watching bitcoin users, as many is possible, to build a large database from where the govs will just fish.  
They started with small fish now they move to large fish, closing tight the circle.  
Don't be fooled and give them all your data. Bitcoin was created to be anonymous, yet you go back and give them all your info: name, location, habits, shopping, BTC addresses, wallets, everything. You just sold your soul to the devil for that $10 referral shit.  
Govs/banksters can't stop or track Bitcoin network in the form it is, but they come with these trick (exchanges, custodial wallets), where they can catch and register all BTC users. Just think twice.

@_date: 2017-11-30 14:24:33
I do not "trust" any exchange, except  P2P decentralized exchanges like Bisq (because actually there is no trust between parties).  
I am from EU too and from 2015 I live only with BTC. Yes, r/LivingOnBitcoin is possible if you really want it. But all starts by being paid in BTC, so wake up with tons of money and you start thinking how to spend them. This is pushing you to use as much is possible only BTC payments.  
I don't care if people laugh about me... in the end I will be the one with a good laugh. I am a.ready because from 2012 until now I NEVER SELL any BTC that I earned, mined, bought. I just HODL &amp; use as money. Now I have a good amount to live off, just like that.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:43:40
This is a great way to move/store BTC! Should be more promoted, used, presented to n00bs.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:05:18
In 2012 I bought my first BTC and start mining.  
In 2013 I bought some cloud mining contracts and make shitload of BTC. I was still buying BTC with all money I had available.  
In 2014 I took a bank loan and bought BTC.  
In 2015 I closed all my bank accounts and start living only with BTC.  
I NEVER sold or will sell for worthless goat shit fiat. NEVER.  
My daughter will not have to worry about money. Bitcoin will secure her future.

Not your keys, not your bitcoin! Learn the damn fucking rule!  
There is no such thing as "bitcoin debit card". [All those cards]( are just another banksters trick to fool the user to go back to use fiat. Those cards are fiat cards NOT BTC.  
Why should I go back to use fiat when I have my own BTC wallet/bank?  
And worse than that, the cards are using FAKE FUCKING MONEY! When people will get this straight? Anything that is on a  card is part of the fucking fractional reserve (aka fake money). Let's stop this madness by not using anymore plastic cards and fiat. How many centuries we have to continue this slavery?  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid the fiat and those cards, and yet people want to go back to fiat.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Using those cards you violate the definition of Bitcoin, that means you are not using Bitcoin anymore. In the moment you supposedly load that card with fiat, by selling (giving away) your BTC, your BTC are not used anymore in a transaction to buy something. You use fiat. So we are back to the same shit.  
There are no merchants in your area that accept BTC? **Make it happen, damn it!** It's up to each one of us to make the adoption. not looking for these shit cards that keep us as banksters slaves!
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:38:25
Coinbase is a bank and act like a bank: is using a semi-fractional reserve with peoples money.  
What you buy through their platform are not real BTC, are just IOUs. They never move BTC from public address x to y. They move it internally inside their own closed blockchain.  
In the moment you want to move out the BTC from your account, they put them into a public blockchain address and make the transfer.  
If you want to receive BTC (from any other wallet) into the same BTC address (supposedly) you already received from the CB exchange/buy. it is not possible, because that address doesn't exist in the public blockchain.  
I am very concerned that someday the "bubble" of Coinbase will explode [exactly how MtGox exploded](  
**Coinbase does NOT have any proof of stake of peoples money**  
Concentrating too many BTC users in the hands of Coinbase is exactly a repeated scenario of MtGox...

Sorry but if it will be a "regulated" or "licensed" exchange, don't bother anymore. Or at least just push it into the market, squeeze the money from users and then close it. Take the money and live happy.  
Centralized, controlled, regulated exchanges will not have too much future. Bitcoin is going to change everything... soon.  
Mark my words.  
If you really want to stay into this business, create a decentralized P2P exchange, concentrate your earnings from moderate transactions and fees. Then you will have a long life into cryptoworld...

I am not trading. I do not have any other shitcoins, except some LTC and XMR (still mining them).  
From 2012 until 2015 I just bought and bought and bought at any price whenever I had some spare cash. Then I start mining a while. Then from 2015 I earn BTC, I am paid in BTC for my work, I don't have to buy anymore.  
I NEVER SELL. If I used, I bought back + 10% more.  
Now I just spend only in BTC, because I closed all my bank accounts.
So during this time I accumulate a nice portion of BTC that just gives me every month more than I need to spend. Now I work for pleasure, I have enough money to live free and with all necessary.  
In a limited supply monetary world, HODL is the key. Do not spend if is not really necessary. I do not need any credit loan, I have my own bank that "credit" me :)

Bitcoin is NOT an "investment". Bitcoin is a winning lottery ticket that you buy today and you win tomorrow.  
In 2015 I closed all my bank accounts, I exchanged all the fiat left into BTC and I happily live after...ONLY with BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-15 21:55:34
Nope.  
Bitcoin doesn't need another centralized exchange offering BTC to buy/sell. We already have hundreds. We need more merchants accepting BTC directly so we can get rid of fiat, finally. We need faster txs. We need more decentralized exchanges and companies that pays their employees in BTC.  
CNBC news - I don't give a shit about, even if are good or bad.  
The price goes up - I don't give a shit and price is not going up because of Square. It goes up because are dumb people thinking that this Square thing will push the price up so they buy now, so in fact they are the ones that pushes the price up. Is just a game.  
Square stocks - I don't give a shit about.  
More companies approaching - No, they will not approach BTC just because some new app accept BTC, they will approach for IT IS Bitcoin and what will do for them.  
Price goes up - is quite relative this. I see more that fiat devaluate...

I did that few years ago and in the end one of the agents get into Bitcoin! I let them search wherever they want and in the end they asked me if it was a joke or what. I replied nicely and sincere that I have in my mind a passphrase that carry at least 50k plus some others in an encrypted pendrive. And I mentioned that is cash is not VISA or a bank account.  
They let me go but one of the agents asked me if I can point him to learn more about tghis digital cash. And I said, just search... bitcoin, will open your eyes.

[Here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial/Coinbase wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are violating [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

Yes is ok. Jaxx is a decent wallet, but still needs lots of improvements  
As a beginner, you should use/test many wallets and stick with those which serve you the best.  
Each wallet have his own good/bad features, there is no such thing in "the best wallet". Some features are more or less useful for each user.  
Me for example as an early adopter (2012) and living only on BTC from 2015 (making a lot of txs), I use regularly, at least 3-4 mobile wallets and 2-3 desktop and hardware wallets. I never keep all my btc in only one wallet. Each wallet is dedicated for a specific use.

Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)

- If it was kidnapped, they knew that killing him they will get shit and he knew that not giving them anything they will not kill him. So why he gave them the BTC? You have to be a real idiot to give up the keys or store in your mind or on you the keys for 450BTC

@_date: 2017-11-12 20:36:27
I think is wrong interpretation for "justice"... Justice for all means that the balance is in the middle. On the other way, putting BTC and fiat in balance is also wrong interpretation. Bitcoin is decentralized and limited supply, fiat is centralized and unlimited supply.

Coinbase is a bank and act like a bank: **is using a semi-fractional reserve with peoples money**.  
What you buy through their platform are not real BTC, are just IOUs. They never move BTC from public address x to y. They move it internally inside their own closed blockchain.  
In the moment you want to move out the BTC from your account, they put them into a public blockchain address and make the transfer.  
If you want to receive BTC (from any other wallet) into the same BTC address (supposedly) you already received from the CB exchange/buy. it is not possible, because that address doesn't exist in the public blockchain.  
I am very concerned that someday the "bubble" of Coinbase will explode [exactly how MtGox exploded](  
**Coinbase does NOT have any proof of stake of peoples money**  
Concentrating too many BTC users in the hands of Coinbase is exactly a repeated scenario of MtGox...

Coinbase is a bank and act like a bank: **is using a semi-fractional reserve with peoples money**.  
What you buy through their platform are not real BTC, are just IOUs. They never move BTC from public address x to y. They move it internally inside their own closed blockchain.  
In the moment you want to move out the BTC from your account, they put them into a public blockchain address and make the transfer.  
If you want to receive BTC (from any other wallet) into the same BTC address (supposedly) you already received from the CB exchange/buy. it is not possible, because that address doesn't exist in the public blockchain.  
I am very concerned that someday the "bubble" of Coinbase will explode [exactly how MtGox exploded](  
**Coinbase does NOT have any proof of stake of peoples money**  
Concentrating too many BTC users in the hands of Coinbase is exactly a repeated scenario of MtGox...  
You have been warned!

I live in EU. The thing is not about countries. Bitcoin is borderless, doesn't matter where you live. You make your LivingOnBitcoin where you live not where is "accepted". Everything depends on each user, not about some kind of gov, regulator, company, merchant groups or something like this.  
Is about each one of us to fight and make this happen. Do not expect from anybody else to come and tell you "hey from now on use BTC". No! Is about YOU to go and teach others what the fuck really is Bitcoin.  
Make talking groups, discuss issues, openly, see each one how can use BTC in their life and how can help them. Find solutions together. Start from small communities, small merchants, neighbors, friends etc. Not big corporations will make this happen, but YOU the small people, because is starting low and grow, faster and faster!  
Bitcoin is FREEDOM, do not expect/wait that Bitcoin will do something for you. Ask yourself what you did for Bitcoin so your freedom will come true.

I live on BTC from 2015 and I deal with lots of merchants almost every day.  
What is sure is that: **If I see a merchant that redirect my payment to an intermediary page (like Coinbase or Bitpay), I will cancel it immediately and never use that merchant again, until they fix "the problem"**  
Bitcoin doesn't need ANY intermediary and in special Coinbase...  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters (BBVA) and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
You have been warned!  
I am paying my groceries to a local small shop run by a pakistani. The tx is wallet to wallet, 0 confirmation time (we know each other) and I get 10% discount. He shows me his QR code for his wallet, I scan &amp; pay. Goodbye!  
I am paying my gas at a local gas station, same as the grocery store.  
I am paying my rent to the landlord, each month he sends me his new BTC address, I pay and goodbye.  
For a small local shop, a watch only wallet, managed by employees is the best solution, they can charge but they can't spend. You don't need any intermediary to use Bitcoin!  
There are also many solutions for software like Odoo with Bitcoin integration, or Wordpress + Woocommerce + plugins linked to your Electrum wallet. Again there is no need for any intermediary between payer and receiver.  
Satoshi make it very clear: A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

Fact: Coinbase withdrawal limits happen because Coinbase is a fucking bank that uses a kind of fractional reserve. They have no proof of stake of users balances.

Let's stop with all these bs screenshots and google false results. The whole google stats is based on each individual history.  
When I typed the same in my browser I never get the same results like you (as you pretend). Actually when I use google (few times) is never suggest me the word bitcoin. And I am a bitcoiner from 2012. Why? Because I will never let my browser to give up info about what am I doing/searching and in special to google.

Yes, some have different technologies, but all of them will report to BTC in the end. And almost all are trying to copy BTC (and they fail just because they try to copy it).  
Will take years until few altcoins will really have some usage in real life. And that usage will not come just because a new altcoin rise, but because some big company or group will decide to create a token used inside their group or connecting people from outside with their group and for more people will want to do that, the value (in BTC) of that token will rise. Utility/necesity for the altcoin will make it valuable not the pump/dumps, shills, paid marketing campaigns and other BS.

I will tell you my story:  
In 2012 I bought my first 1 BTC from a miner, friend of mine for just $30.  
Then I start mining too and buying more and more.  
NEVER SELL.  
In Oct 2014 my wife  took a credit from a bank, I bought BTC with all fiat   
In 2015 I closed all my bank accounts and start living only with BTC (I am paid in BTC, I pay only in BTC my expenses, I HODL what remains).  
If you look into 2-3-5-10 years, yes definitely you should take a bank credit and buy the fucking Bitcoin.  
But remember: **no matter the up/down is moving the price... HODL all the way!** If you get scared, you are fucked.

Using those cards you violate the definition of Bitcoin, that means you are not using Bitcoin anymore. In the moment you supposedly load that card with fiat, by selling (giving away) your BTC, your BTC are not used anymore in a transaction to buy something. You use fiat. So we are back to the same shit.

[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
You have been warned!  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

Coinbase is a bank, funded and created by the banksters (BBVA), with the goal of registering, tracking, monitoring, seizing etc of bitcoin users, as many is possible. Reson for that? To build a huge database of bitcoin users, linking all the BTC addresses used in Coinbase with all their friends, merchants, partners etc. This is the ONLY way that govs and banksters can fight against BTC.  
What to use?  
[As wallet]( - any wallet that respect [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](  
As exchange - [here is a full list]( but I strongly suggest to start thinking in being paid in BTC, or use bitwage.co to receive your wage in BTC, or use a decentralized P2P exchange.  
In any case, is recommended to shapeshift all your known income in BTC. Known = registered account in your real name, for buying BTC.  
Shapeshifting = exchange your BTC received, into altcoins, then back to new created BTC addresses, spreading the amounts and losing track of the original income.  
**This IS NOT an advice for money laundering, this is an advice for protecting your own financial privacy** (a right that many people forget they have it and lose it too easy)

Great article!  
*"A DECENTRALIZED CRYPTOCURRENCY CAN'T POSSIBLY FAIL  
As more and more people continue to adopt bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, their value will continue to outperform both gold and the US dollar (as it has already done so since 2009)."*  
That's why govs and banksters will do EVERYTHING possible to slow down the adoption, keeping the population in the dark, brainwashed, deceiving them with shit news on MSM controlled by the banksters. But slowly people get the right information and wake up.  
*"It's not a matter of if Bitcoin or another crypto currency will succeed, it's a matter of when."*

If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries). There are already many solutions to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

Yes, I wasn't referring to bring Andreas from the first meetup. You will need some audience with some knowledge first. Take it slowly and never lose faith and hope, even if you will have more nocoiners in the beginning.  
I was the only person in my community few years ago, when I start talking with people. Now... we are more than 80% using BTC here (a small town in EU). All because of those meetups and open discussions. Don't push the things to hard, let them come up with subjects and just help them to see the path. In teh beginning try to explain the nature of money, that we use today and how could be money using BTC. Reveal the true evil nature of fiat money to those who still do not see it.

If I would be a "goxed" I would take a loan now, buy cheap coins and when they give the money back (fiat) will pay back the loan. Will remain with a good chunk of BTC actually for free.

Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.

If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.   
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**   
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
These links are a must read for all those who get NOW into Bitcoin so they will know about this issue and who are the perpetrators:

@_date: 2018-03-18 08:39:57


Why do not start paying those bills? They need an invitation from their gov or what? Nobody stop them to be the first. But without keeping the BTC, they will never be able to pay their employees in BTC.  
For example I had a client, a small company that I told them that want to be paid in BTC and they told me: we don't have any BTC.  
So I show them how to buy and HODL some. They start buying little by little, then they start accepting BTC for their services and so on. They never sell those BTC, just keep them as reserves.  
Then they start paying employees from those reserves, in BTC.  
They wanted to be a start not because is trendy, but because they want to get rid of fiat.  
Dumping BTC for fiat is NOT the solution.  
All this mentality of "until everybody will accept it" is wrong. YOU are the one that make it happening! So do it!
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:42:48


Yes, for the time being it is like this. We start negotiating now to have a base in BTC and the rest is calculated in fiat at the exchange rate of the day of payment.  
I do pay, few of my bills, that are still in fiat, through Bitwala (that is very popular here in EU). Before it was Cashila, with a wonderful plugin for Mycelium wallet that allow you to pay bills straight from your own wallet.  
I pay my rent directly to the landlord. He was the first I convinced to take my BTC, few years ago.  
I have particular bill that I pay through a friend. I gave him BTC for his own HODL and he pays my bill from his bank account. Every month. He is more than happy to do that.  
I close all my bank accounts in 2015 because I want to do this, to live only on BTC. It is hard, but I want it so hard to not deal anymore with banks. I am not recommending to everybody that jumps now in BTC to do this. Is hard and I think in special in US.  
I could do it because I had a long experience with BTC before 2015. I bought a lot, I mined, I earned and never sell. That's gave me a lot of reserves of BTC. I could even live off only from those BTC I hodl until now, actually I work for pleasure not because I need to.  
I do not want lambos and shit, I just want a normal life with all I need for me and my family (I have a daughter).  
I think also I was lucky a bit, because of the community where I live. Many people here are using BTC, some because of me, some because they have friends but most of them they realized that BTC is the future and slowly, they start using it.  
We had lot of meetups, talking to each other about this and we are a good community of people that decided to not let this to be sneaked out to the media. Otherwise it will ruin all. So we keep it low profile and we do our business as usual.  
We do not have too much tourism around so the "intrusion" will not be a problem. Maybe some day, someone will discover our place, full of BTC, but most of the merchants do not "advertise" BTC on their doors, we all know who accept it or not. We do not have any "profile" on coinmap.org too. We decided that for the time being is better like that. If Satoshi decided to not make public his real identity, why us? Yes we still have people here that are not still convinced to use BTC, but we do not push anybody. I hope none of them will reveal our little "secret", but we know they are good people, are our neighbors for years. Time will convince them too.

I live from 2015 without any fiat bank account and VISA card, only with BTC, but where I live, in EU, we understand the power of BTC and the weakness of VISA.  
Yes it wasn't easy, but first of all we had to take out from our minds the visa cards. Then all come easily.

- they can't expand the business as they want, due to more regulations and pressure from banks, so they prefer to step out full of money

I hope you learn a lesson now and read the warnings.  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)

Meetups are very good to spread the word.  
I was also involved in some local meetups in my community and was a real success.  
People want to hear more about Bitcoin and discuss directly, people know that TV is just feeding lies and they want to hear more from people involved and with knowledge.  
Make it an open event, not just by inviting people. Let others non-invited to participate into the discussions, will bring more arguments and push people to discuss, even if they are nocoiners, let them reveal themselves.  
Idea: Maybe you could bring Andreas via video conference and make a Q&amp;A session directly with people. Not sure if his schedule agenda allow that, but you could try.

Sorry but is using Shitpay-Bitpay... no more booze with BTC  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
These links are a must read for all those who get NOW into Bitcoin so they will know about this issue and who are the perpetrators:  
  
  
   
  
  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.

Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**

BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)

My way to hide some of my wallets is:  
1. take the seed words and insert/use them in a normal story text. Take that text and use it as an email sent to your mother/family or post it on a webpage/your own webpage, whatever other online place from where you could restore the text and extract your words, known only by you.  
2. take the seed and insert it into a nice picture using the technique of steganography. [An example here]( That picture file you could save it on several locations online, in plain sight, nobody will know what contains. I have one in my living room so every day I am looking to "my wallet" :)  
3. use a password manager app to store your wallet details. Take that pwd manager database file and store it on an usb thumb drive encrypted (when you plug it will ask for a pwd). Put on that usb your encrypted wallet files, seeds, databases, important info etc). Make more copies of that usb and store them in separate places. I have one hidden into a time capsule for my daughter, under a tree, deep in a forest.  
Save in a text file all your public addresses of those hidden wallets, so you could always send BTC to those wallets, without opening them, like a personal address book. I usually save them into my regular daily usage wallets (electrum have that option too).  
Be inventive, there are many ways to secure and hide your wallets.

You should be the one to refuse the payment.  
That's why I always said: 
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.

Conbase is shit! Like Google that "offers you free stuff" but in fact you pay a lot more: your privacy. Same with Conbase, you sell your identity to the scumbags of IRS, 3 letters agencies, banksters and many others. If you don't care about your privacy then you don't deserve nothing.
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**

Do your homeworks, there are tons of ways to do it.  
The 1st and simple one: just put your own BTC address/QR code on your site. No need any permission/intermediary for that.  
Later you can expand your acceptance by using BTCPay or Bitcoinway plugins/servers, with no intermediary at all.  
There are many others, just look into it. Bitcoin innovation just started.

We need a place where to check the scams? Yes.  
We need a tool to track "bad" BTC addresses? No.  
Soon we will have much more privacy and anonymity in BTC addresses so a tool that track those addresses will fade and became useless.  
In any system of control and monitor would be abuses, mistakes, bad acting, paranoia etc that will make that system useless just because these abuses will create confusion.  
Tracking scammers is another story.

Those who get goxed and expect to be paid for their loses, they should buy now on the incoming dips as much as they can BTC. After they will finish the sale, price will going to explode.  
They buy cheap BTC now, they get money back from MtGox, everybody's happy.

That was also my case. I was talking with the owner and convince him to start by keeping some of his cash/bank reserves in BTC. He start low buying BTC. Then they move to 80% of reserves in BTC and keep only usual amount for regular expenses in banks. Companies are changing.  
Now, they start accepting BTC, but they still pays me and other 2 employees in BTC from their reserves.  
For those who still do not have BTC reserves, but the employees till wants to be paid in BTC, the solution is Bitwage.com Works great with USD and EUR. Legal, fast, easy.  


When the company pays your wage, is already deducting your income tax, before paying in BTC. On your wage papers is all there. BTC is used only as a payment method. Company do not need to explain to nobody how you received the money, in fiat or BTC.

If you plan to buy a shopify store and start accepting BTC payments, you should know from the beginning that Shopify will force you to use ONLY their 3rd party intermediaries for BTC, that are BitPay and Conbase.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
Conbase we all know who really is and what is doing so no need more details.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.

For all those who still didn't saw my warning or still ignore it, here it is:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

What is life without risks? NOTHING.  
I took a loan from a bank in 2014 to buy BTC as much as I could. In 2015 I paid the credit and now I sit on a shitload of BTC... I will NEVER sell for the worthless goat shit fiat.  
I suggest to all students doing this. Today we are living a very low price to buy BTC, you will never see this price again in your lifetime!  
People are getting wrong the Bitcoin price. What you see is NOT a low price compared with a future high price when you will want to sell your BTC. Today's low price is the price you are willing to pay for 1 BTC that you will never sell it.  
I have to remember you all this:  
March 2010: $0.0003  
March 2011: $1  
March 2012: $5  
March 2013: $80  
March 2014: $600  
March 2015: $250  
March 2016: $400  
March 2017: $950  
March 2018: $8500  
If your goal is to have your money inssured for your future 3-5 years, buy now and wait. Wait for the day when you will go to a shop and pay 1 coffee with 1 satoshi, 1 car with 0.1BTC, a house with 1BTC and so on.  
Zoom out your price graph and do not concentrate to the 1h graph, see the 1 year graph... and where you want to go.  
It will come that day when the price in fiat doesn't mean anything anymore... so is really worthless to think that you will sell in a future day for the worthless goat shit fiat.

I really do not understand the point of accepting BTC if you will not use it/put it back into the market. Dumping it for fiat once you get it doesn't make any sense.  
Stay with fiat, visa, bank accounts, cash and shit and don't complicate things with BTC.  
You want to be part of the Bitcoin revolution and secure your future: accept BTC, HODL it or just use it to buy things or pay your employees. They will be anyway richer than you soon.  
Merchants should understand this: sooner or later they will have to use BTC anyway, fiat is going to be less and less used.

I would love to support your online shop, I like to buy stuff with BTC but is "Powered by Shopify". Shopify force their users to use Bitpay/Conbase as intermediary...  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
  
  
  
  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
You should really take in consideration this: 
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:10:52
Just tested.  
1. No support for segwit addresses - bad point  
2. create new wallet/seed, restore it - ok  
3. restore a seed from an old electrum wallet (non segwit) - bad, doesn't tell me if the seed is not compatible, nor that is wrong, also is not importing any of previous activity or addresses, so I can't use the app with other seeds.  
4. trying to restore a seed from stand alone BIP39  generated wallet  - it doesn't restore anything just generate new addresses new wallet with same seed. really bad, you could lose money  
5. restore seed generated with lumi wallet into electrum - works fine, same addresses  
So, is a good start but still a lot of work to do for a full release product

Yes that video is an eye opener.  
But you always have to remember: Bitcoin will never be affected by the other scams around, even if the media will try to associate it.  
Bitconnect, Bitfinex, Tether are all separate scams that try to bring down Bitcoin by deceiving people.  
Yes, Tether scam is going to blow up and all that shit will affect the BTC price, but not Bitcoin entirely.  
If people slowly will stop using that shit scam of Tether the damages will not be so big. But people's greed is big.  
You have to learn how to protect yourself from all these scams and always focus on Bitcoin, don't be distracted but the noise around.  
Yes, I will get now shitload of downvotes and insults, because there are so many manipulators here that only want to push Tether and scam people. I don't care. I care if more other noobs get warned and just make them think before using that shit Tether.

If the merchants are focused ONLY in getting quick money, Then all those should stick with VISA and fiat, why bother with BTC.  
Merchants that accept BTC should keep it and */or use it to pay employees, suppliers bills etc. If they take it just to dump it and because is trendy they are wasting their time and they fool those people that paid in BTC.  
Any bitcoiner that pays in BTC, thinks that they help the network and the merchant and the merchant that sells those BTC immediately is just throwing away that trust of his customer.

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Conbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Conbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Conbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

Just a few observations after a quick look:  
- On both webs lakebtc.com and lakebanker.com **there is no any information** about who really is behind this company/group of people. Legally, when you deal with money YOU as a customer have to know to who you are giving your money. Missing this information is a **red flag**.  
- I see that they started in 2013 and few complaints about them. This doesn't mean they are good or bad.  
- The contact info for domain names is Michael Smithland, 181 Queens Road Central, Hong Kong 999077, with a weird tel number  
More details you could read here:

Welcome to the fucking show!  
Yes, actually I live only on BTC, I am paid in BTC, I spend only in BTC and I HODL too.  
If you start taking BTC I suggest to start paying your employees or suppliers with BTC. If you still don't have enough BTC for that, just HODL. Do not dump your BTC for worthless goat shit fiat!  
I suggest you to list your business on  and   
But I see that your webshop is "Powered by Shopify".... that means you are forced to use a 3rd party payment processor for BTC payments, like Bitpay/Conbase.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.

Oliver is not doing any good with his "irony" about Bitcoin.

Nope. Bitcoin will allow in this phase the govs and taxation to exist. But soon will make both obsolete.  
Bitcoin will give more and more power to the people to control their money and also how to spend them. Right now the govs/banksters are still in power and control of the money, that's why you still pay forced taxes.  
Ask yourself what will happen when you can decide what you want to fund, as community spend/budget, with your money and your vote. First, people will stop funding politicians, govs useless spends, wars, military budget. Then will remain plenty of money for funding projects that really help society, without being forced to pay by taxation.

I would love to support your webshop and buy some keyrings (btw are beautiful), but the site is "Powered by Shopify"... that means Shopify force their users to use Bitpay or Conbase as a 3rd party intermediary for BTC payments.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

Depends where you live. I live in EU, in a small community where BTC is widely accepted at local merchants.  
Bills? There are many services that allows you to pay your fiat bills with your BTC. I have friends happy to take my BTC in exchange of paying my bills.  
All you mentioned is now largely available to buy online. From 2015 until today I have never have an issue of finding something to buy, that I need, with BTC. even if the online merchant is not accepting BTC (yet), be polite and ask in a private email if they can accept a particular payment in BTC, explaining that I can't pay with other otopn because I do not have anymore fiat. Some understands, some not. For those who doesn't understands, I ask them then to provide me a bank account to pay. So I use those services/friends that pays for me in fiat and I pay them in BTC.  
I never lose hope. Yes is hard, but not impossible.  
Yes I am a member of a small % of people that r/LivingOnBitcoin but that doesn't mean is not real.  
Each one of us os making his own future. You want to continue living in a fiat world, being a slave to the masters banksters or you want to take some risks and be free in Bitcoinlandia?  
What is life without risks? NOTHING.

Is just another bancksters trick (we already know that BBVA is behind Conbase) to fool merchants now.

That means Shopify will force you to use an established 3rd party intermediary to take BTC payments for you.

I will never let my seed on a cloud storage that will never control it 100% anytime.  
If you have your own NAS on different locations, yes, but otherwise, no.  
Remember Mega? Gov can close access anytime to any cloud storage.  
Everything you put on cloud IS NOT YOURS anymore. No matter if you encrypted or not, you can lose the access to that file anytime. And you are fucked.  
I will tell you some of "my ways" how do I keep some of my seeds.  
I have many wallets. HW, software, "virtual paper", mobile etc. Never keep all BTC in only one. spread on all different amounts, for different usage.  
Hardware wallets. Always 2 copies, 2 devices with the same seed, one device always with me, another one (copy) saved in a secure place, under a rock, 2 feet under the ground or whatever place you know only you and you can recover it anytime, fast.  
Always make the backups of the seed and test it before you put any BTC on those HW.  
The seed you can hide it easily:  
- steganography. Use a nice photo with cats and hide inside your seed. [Example here]( That photo you could post it on a blog, your web, or whatever public online place from where you could recover it fast, easy, anytime. You can post it in many places, just in case. Me personally I have a nice wallpaper in a room that contains a hidden wallet. In plain sight 10BTC, and I am looking everyday to it.  
- hidden text. You can take your seed words and insert them into a nice text, book extract or love letter. Send that text to your family, post it on a forum, blog, website whatever online place from where you could recover it easily, fast, anytime. Nobody will know that the text contain your seed. Or at least do not tell to anybody that. Just think that I can hide a seed right now in this post. Nobody can find that seed, only me know which are the words.  
Be inventive, there are many ways to hide in plain sight the seed and be always with it.

I see you have a small shop, not an webshop.  
1. First thing generate a real segwit wallet, offline, with BIP39 generator  Save all the details in a safe place (encrypted USB for ex.)  
2. Use the generated passphrase to open your wallet in Electrum desktop, for convenience and tracking orders/payments etc. In a safe computer, at home/office, **not at the front desk**.  
3. Use the same generated passphrase, if you like, in a Samourai mobile wallet, in case you want to check, track, use those BTC. You will have the same wallet as in Electrum.  
4. Use the xpub master key (see it in the moment you generate the wallet, or you could do it later from Electrum) to create a **watch only wallet** in Sentinel, for you employees, front desk shop. Never use a real wallet on the front desk. Robbery will be a real concern from now on.  
Electrum and Samourai offers you real privacy and 100% control of your BTC. Conbase is a bank and will just track, monitor, seize, share your data with 3rd parties.  
Bitcoin was created exactly to avoid these 3rd parties.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

no is not. Bcash is shit cash.  
Any merchant that announce they accept Bcash is like announcing: "we accept any IOU shit worthless paper", we just want to be our customer".  
If they would really want to support BTC they will make the announcement: we will not accept any BCH due to lack of trust and intention of hijacking the Bitcoin name.

Bitcoin is not an ideology and that's why was created: to kick out bloodsuckers like you, that only want to hijack merchants money.  


Trying to present Bitcoin payments as to be hard to implement is not gonna work, people get educated and your lies will be revealed. You just want to fool them not to help them. You don't care about Bitcoin's future or merchants to keep BTC to close the circle, you just push them to dump the BTC for the worthless goat shit fiat and take your commission. There is no difference between Coingate and Paypal, so why a merchant should take BTC with you when they can just stick with VISA/Paypal, is the same thing.

Please stop shill for Conbase.  
Warning to all merchants that want to accept BTC as payment method.  
Merchants, do your job correctly, if you really want to take BTC, there are many ways to do it in the right way, without any intermediary (as Conbase or Bitpay).  
Do not violate your customer rights and privacy by forcing them to pay with BTC through a payment processor (3rd party).  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid these and give freedom and full P2P payment solution between customer and merchant.
**Reminder [Satoshi's papers]( stated: Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Bitcoin doesn't need any intermediary to track, monitor, control my BTC payment. There are many solutions in place that gives you FREE and full control of all the process. BTCPay, Bitcoinway, Coingate, Odoo etc.  
Don't let others to interfere between you and your customer. For that shit we have fiat. If you still want an intermediary, use the fucking fiat and VISA.  
You have been warned!  
Like it or not, this warning will raise more questions and make more people think about this and bring again the question: **why the fuck Satoshi created Bitcoin in the first place?**

Steps to do:  
1. I supposed that you already set a password for your wallet, when you create it.  
1.a Take notes about your existing BTC addresses  
2. Take the file wallet.dat from your Bitcoin Core Data folder and save it/copy it somewhere else. Better make 2 copies.  
3. Proceed to the recovery test. Delete the original wallet.dat file or better just rename it in wallet.da0  
4. Open again the Bitcoin Core wallet app. It will generate a new wallet.dat file, empty, with new addresses.  
5. Take notes about new generated addresses, just to compare.  
6. Close your Bitcoin Core wallet and delete the new generated wallet.dat file, or rename it wallet.da1  
7. Recover your original (first) wallet.dat file in the same location it was originally.  
8. Open your Bitcoin Core and voila, you will see your previous BTC addresses and your entire wallet.  
That wallet.dat file is the most important thing.  
Now, if you create a new wallet based on mnemonic 12 words, you really don't need that wallet.dat file, you can recover it only by using those 12 words.

1. that is in the case you are not hosting on your own machine. **A merchant that doesn't have his own node better do not accept BTC anymore.**  
2. Why this should be 1 click install? You are doing setup for a payment system for your own shop and secure the payment for for your customers. For fuck sake you really think a 1 click setup will do that?  
3. That is the point: to hodl &amp; use those BTC not throwing them right away for goat shit fiat. Otherwise, just use directly fiat payments.

This is the perfect example that Bitcoin is changing the world and changing the way people see things.  
Until now, in the world of fiat, people used/pushed to spend money that they never have for things they never want/use and more than that, people get in debt just for doing that (stupid) habit.  
Now, in Bitcoinlandia, people start having noble goals like OP. Saving 1 BTC, because you never know when you will gonna need it later, with no debt.  
Humanity start rising again, breaking the chains of slavery.

A nocoiner even when he have an unique opportunity to buy cheap is not jumping in.  
When the price is higher the nocoiner scream that BTC is a bubble. Not buying, is too expensive.  
When the price plummet, the nocoiner scream that this is a scam and will go to zero. Not buying, is going to crash and die.  
The moral? The nocoiner always will be a loser nocoiner because is too blind to see the biggest opportunity in his lifetime to fix his wrong thinking, at least when is offering one like now.

A dump of 180k BTC, even it will be in chunks, not all at once, will push the market price, lower, lower, until all the dumped coins are buy back.  
You will never see that low price anymore, because once they finish the dump the price will bounce back like a volcano. People and in special traders will not sell their coins so cheap anymore and the pressing on higher price will be even faster.  
That's why it will be your lifetime opportunity if you didn't bought until now cheap coins.

Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**

BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)

OP you shold warn them that they joined with the devil of Bitcoin, Bitpay.  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
  
  
  
  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**

But what people should understand and have in mind is that using Bitcoin brings also a big responsibility: being your own bank is not easy as many here think. If you do not take really in serious your privacy and security, you end up bad.

You will never know. That is Bitcoin.  
BTW, if your state will buy BTC with your taxes (because a state will have money only from your contributions), you would be in rights to redeem your BTC no? Or at least your gov should inform you: we bought x amount of BTC with your contributions.  
But hey, when your gov informed you about how they spend your money? NEVER!  
So why you bother to ask if any states own BTC? It's just meaningless.  
BTC are owned by each individual not by states. Bitcoin is the money controlled and owned by the people.

No. They are not up to date. They just want you to be an idiot and declare it and give them your money. THAT's IT!  
Let's be clear: if you are smart enough, nobody can force you to pay taxes fro your BTC (gains or not gains). It's impossible for the taxman to prove that.  
So next time, in the box where it says "BTC", just put zero.

Why?  
Because Bitcoin adoption depends on each one of us not just some big companies.

Why?  
Because people start realizing that fiat money is a fucking lie and they need real money that they can control themselves.

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Conbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Conbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:52:40
Even then there is no law that will specify, you have to pay tax on your BTC. "Gain" doesn't mean Bitcoin. Seeing all over this BS media the term "pay taxes for your BTC" will have a huge impact over those people that do not know the fact that Bitcoin can't be taxed. This is total brainwashing.

All major centralized exchanges are monitored by any 3 letters gov agencies. You always have to keep that in mind.  
EDIT: [a very good article about your own protection, by u/nopara73](  
The problem is not what is describing the article, but what people do letting NSA and his gov to allow these kind of practices.... NOTHING.  
It was many times here, when I was warning people not to use that and that because is a violation of users rights. What I get? Attacks from those troll armies, because I dare to reveal their plan. Many regular and decent users come up and say that they never have any issue with that and that, they are happy with that service... That attitude of ignorance makes the 3 letters agencies to continue their evil tactics to spy on people. That attitude is far more dangerous than the spying itself... because deliberately we forget our rights and freedoms.  
After reading this article and knowing that is fact that 3 letters agencies were conducting operations to create and control deepweb sites, put in mind this: Silk Road was actually also a 3 letter agency operation from the beginning. That was a massive spy operation to track and monitor from the beginning all BTC txs. Ross was used as a patsy and that's why he will never leave the prison, so he will not be able to speak the truth.

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
A merchant that uses an intermediary for his BTC payments VIOLATES the definition of Bitcoin and with that betray the user trust itself! If they really want to use an intermediary, they have fiat/visa/mastercard for that no need for Bitcoin.  
Merchants, do not come up with the pathetic excuse of "convenience", there are many ways to accept BTC without any intermediary, there is no excuse for giving up the trust and freedom of your customers!

Don't wait... do something for Bitcoin. Every user's move is important. By just using BTC as money and you start making cracks into banksters dam. Next step to make those cracks bigger? Dump all the fiat, close the bank accounts and live free only with BTC. I did that in 2015.  
If each one of us, let's say all the readers of this sub, 760k people will do that, tomorrow you will see in the news all over only cracks in the banksters dam.  
For long we are using fiat, for long they will stay on this planet. I hope Elon Musk will put all the banksters on a rocket and send them all to Mars to ruin all martians economy and life.

Look, I live only with BTC from 2015.  
I am paid in BTC and I spend in BTC.  
But before 2012 when I knew nothing about BTC I was spending my money on stupid things that actually don't need them. I realize that when I start getting into BTC.  
Bitcoin makes you saving your money by hodling and not spending them on things you really don't need.  
From 2015 and so on, I start paying with BTC only for things I really need to live a normal life. And I could save a lot of BTC for my daughter's future and for having a nice pension funded by my HODLing BTC.  
Just look around you, we are flooded and invaded by a lot of crap products and services. Limit your spend, save for later, live a normal life.  
Bitcoin is changing totally the system as we are used to have.  
Just an example: until now we used to go to a bank, take a loan to buy a house, then you and your children will be in debt forever. Now, you HODL BTC for you children to have enough to buy a house and **be in no-debt forever.**

Recently I was talking with a friend about how to keep safe a copy of our wallets.  
So we agree to have each one an USB drive, encrypted, with a copy of his wallet.  
We exchange those USBs, without having any way to decrypt them because each one we know the password for own USB. But each one trust the other to keep the other USB, as a safe keeper. If I need my copy I can call anytime my friend and he can give me my USB copy.  
We even create a secret code: in case I am kidnapped and threaten, in case I will call him asking for the copy, if I would not say the secret word, well established between us, he will not give me the real USB but a fake one, with a fake wallet.  
Same I will do for him.

I live also in a community like that, but we decided to not make public our "marriage" with Bitcoin. We want to be let in peace by media and in special by gov.  
Too much publicity is not good and is ripping off the community.  
We live in peace, we use BTC daily, we discuss about Bitcoin together but we do not make noise in public about our affinity to BTC.  
Maybe later when all is settle ok we will bring out all our BTC stickers all over the places, but until then we keep it quiet, only between us, locals. If an "outsider" discover that we accept BTC almost everywhere, we treat it as a small "incident" and let the "outsider" to be happy that he paid with BTC.  
Again, all the best to that Italian community!  
"Ivan is one of a growing number of Rovereto merchants who accept bitcoin. Ivan started accepting bitcoin in early 2017 and has kept most of his coins, he says with a wide smile." - That's a real Bitcoin merchant!  
“I would like to set up a system where my suppliers — those that sell me cheese or vegetables — get paid their share automatically when I sell a pizza,” he explains. The last customers have left the restaurant, so he’s locked the doors and is lighting up a cigarette as he sits down to talk Bitcoin. “This solves a liquidity problem. I would no longer need to put investment up front, and instead, automatically forward a part of any payment I receive.” - That sounds like Andreas idea with LN paying salaries by each hour...  
But Ivan should get rid of that Bitpay intermediary...

For merchants with webshops with shopping carts it is necessary an extra code. But that can be done now through many plugins that are not working as intermediary, just facilitate the payment between wallets (merchant and customer).  
If you have just a simple web and you don't use any shopping cart then is not necessary for these plugins. Is enough just to post your BTC address or QR code and done.

**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

The most important thing is the node data folder.  
I have setup a node that uses the data location a [NAS]( with 4 disks in RAID 5. If one disk fails, I could still access the data normally until the bad disk is replaced. Doesn't affect at all your node.  
You could expand that to 2 node machines that uses the NAS as storage so you can have full high availability.  
I do not recommend using the same data folder for both nodes, it can be messy. Make a copy on the same NAS. In this way you can have also a backup.  
You could have also a fifth disk with regular backup sync of that data folder, in case it gets corrupted or the whole nas is broken, you could just redirect your node to the backup disk and you are still in business. Any decent NAS have the option to sync regularly or periodically when you want a folder or entire LUN.  
I still hope there will be some day an app for NAS that integrate a BTC node and/or LN.

I would love to support that online shop, I like to buy stuff with BTC but is "Powered by Shopify". **Shopify force their users to use Bitpay/Conbase** as intermediary...  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
  
  
  
  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

I strongly suggest to NOT use as a main or usual wallet one that keeps more than 1 crypto. Is not safe.  
To use multicurrency wallet I suggest to use it only for temporary txs, NOT to keep your coins there. One multicurrencu could be Coinomi.  
[There are many more out there, but always have in mind the golden rule of bitcoin.](
What I suggest is the following:  
1. Use this tool **offline**, on a clean computer   
2. Generate a wallet seed BIP39 with derivation path 49 (for segwit). Done, you have your first "segwit paper wallet".  
3. Write down/save in an encrypted file all the information needed.  
4. Install Samourai wallet and use the generated seed to open that wallet. Done, now you have a segwit wallet on your mobile, same as the paper wallet.  
5. Download Electrum desktop wallet in your computer.  
6. Use the same seed to open your wallet into Electrum. Use the option for BIP39 and derivation path 49 **(this is very important)**. Done, now you have your segwit wallet on paper, mobile, desktop. Accessible anytime.  
Optional, if you are more concerned and want to have more privacy in your txs, use Samourai wallet (also Electrum wallet) to connect to your own node. Install Bitcoin Core wallet/node/client on a computer, be sure you have downloaded and updated the blockchain database and then connect your Samourai wallet to your own node. All your wallet txs will go only through  your own node.

2. Generate a segwit BIP39 passphrase  
3. Save all the details necessary  
4. Open latest Electrum, create new wallet, based on passphrase you already have. When you paste the seed, use the "options" button and select BIP39. Next step will ask you to set the Derivation code for your wallet. So change 44 with 49 (segwit enabler).  
5. Done, you have now a full segwit wallet in your Electrum.  
6. You can use the same passphrase on Samourai mobile wallet, having in this way the same wallet on desktop and mobile.  
7. Test your wallet recovery on both apps, BEFORE moving any large amount of BTC.

You don't have to buy exactly 1 BTC, you could buy BTC worth of 20-50-100 bucks/week/month/day.  
Yes, if you want to save on transaction fees, exchanges fees, bank transfers fees, you should probably save more cash and when you are ready buy with all.  
You could do this: let's say you have 20 bucks affordable every week/day. Put them into an exchange account (I suggest Bitstamp for easiness), every time you have available. Let them there for a while until you get more. Next week/day, you have more? Put them into the same account. Do not buy yet. **Wait for a fucking dip** We always have a dip, trust me I am in BTC from long time ago. When you see "blood" (all red) going down... BUY THE FUCKING DIP (BTFD)!  
Then ... silence... wait... patience... DO NOT FUCKING PANIC... just HODL.  
Do not buy when you see green and going up the price.  You get screwed/rekt and you will regret. Regrets bring desperation and you will sell and you will lose all.  
Once you bought, MOVE your BTC to your own fucking wallet! Then forget you have them (I mean do not sell them).

Now with those 13k users, IRS will play another game, to show to rest of the population that still doesn't get what is BTC, that BTC it's easy to control so don't bother to read the white paper, just follow our instructions and use Conbase.

I am glad that a new merchant decided to accept BTC, I salute that.  
But unfortunately I see that you redirect the BTC payment to a 3rd party like Conbase, If I would buy from your shop, I will cancel the payment and NEVER use your shop until you fix the big problem you have.  
[Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Bitcoin doesn't need any intermediary to track, monitor, control my BTC payment. That's why was invented in the first place, to get rid of all these bloodsuckers, gov and banksters puppets.  
Merchants, do your job correctly, if you really want to take BTC, there are many ways to do it in the right way, without any intermediary.  
Otherwise you are just violating your customers rights and privacy.  
I am sorry if I ruined your expectations, but this is a serious warning to help you to do it right.

This is just an excuse to not do the right thing for their customers. That doesn't mean they have to continue to violate customer's privacy. We had that until now with CC and fiat. Is time for a change and merchants now have an opportunity to do it right with Bitcoin.  
People have to be well informed all the time about risks and violations so they can decide for themselves which services deserved to be used or not.  
I bet that quite few people, even here on this sub, knows that Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:52:35
I will tell you how I started my risk: slowly.  
In 2011-2012 I was drinking quite a lot. At least 10 beers/day. So I took the decision to drink less and the money that I would spend on beers to put them in BTC. I am talking about when the BTC price was around $30 not like today $8000...  
From 2012 every time I had some spare cash, I bought BTC and NEVER sell... my grandkids will be very proud of what I did for them.  
From 2015 I start being paid in BTC, I do not accept anymore fiat for my work.

Bitnovo should put their fees and charges very clear on their FAQs. Is a total rip off their system of vouchers and the users will never know how much they will get until is too late. Hiding this information is considered scammer tactics.  
Yes, is good what you are doing with these vouchers, you help people to get easy some BTC and almost anonymous. For that users are willing to pay a fair price, but at least let them know from the beginning what should expect.

People asking about "safety" of a wallet forgot one fucking big important thing: [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](  
If a wallet doesn't comply with that rule, is NOT a wallet, is simply a bank! So choose wisely   
I strongly suggest to anybody else: use not just one wallet, but many (desktop, mobile, HW, paper), educate yourself how to use each one of them and use each one of them for a specific purpose.   
In Bitcoinlandia there is no such thing of "safe wallet" because each use of an wallet is exposed to a keylogger and shit like that. So your question will be correct if you ask, how safe is your computer/mobile to use a BTC wallet.

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning: Conbase and Square are not your place to keep/use your BTC   
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)

Any merchant should just ignore any crypto to fiat service. They already have visa services for fiat.  
Now, those which really want to get "dirty" with some crypto, should stick with HODLing their  crypto and/or using to pay employees or suppliers with it. Exchange the already taken BTC for fiat is REALLY stupid and useless. No need to be taken in the first place if you plan to give it up for fiat.  
Any merchant that takes BTC and then put in circulation again that BTC (by paying his employees, suppliers) is a real supporter of BTC and that is the REAL adoption. Those merchants we have to help them because are the big engines of Bitcoin.

For Bitcoin Core wallet, is not really necessary to export the private keys, to be "safe". If you encrypted your wallet with a password, you could easily take that wallet.dat file and save it wherever you want, in a safe place, even putting it on an encrypted USB thumb drive.  
Every time you will need to access that wallet, and want to send out a tx, you will be asked for the encryption password.

I will repeat the warning.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

I stop reading at "Customer checked out with BitPay."  
All merchants dealing BTC through an intermediary/3rd party should stop this right now. They are doing more harm to themselves and to their customers.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.** 
If you do not use BTC to HODL, pay your employees/suppliers, there is no need to accept it! You have VISA and fiat for that shit.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a 3rd party I will cancel the BTC payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem.  
Bitcoin is the currency, the payment processor and your fucking pension. No need for other intermediaries to deal it for you!  
DISCLAIMER:  I live on BTC from 2015 and I make a lot of BTC payments. I jumped into BTC in 2012 and NEVER sell it for fucking fiat! I use it as fucking money.

No. I used in the past Bitwage. Now I am paid directly to my wallet. Every month new address.  
Bitwage I suggested for those who want to start or their employers still doesn't have BTC reserves, so it's easy to get paid in BTC even if the employer doesn't know it.  


Actually that is doing Bitwage, for a small fee. You don't have to worry from where to buy, fees, dips/spikes etc, you just get BTC and forget it.

Take it easy. The step to go full on BTC is not easy.  
I have many years into Bitcoin and I was planning all along from the first day of 2012 when I get into Bitcoin for the first time. Took me 3 years to make the step. Accumulating BTC, understanding BTC, testing, mining, earning. Then start convincing others and explaining them. That was the best part, by teaching others, I was teaching me too. Meetups, long talks with friends, merchants, clients.  
Today my 30% of all my income is from people that I help them into Bitcoin, consulting. They pay me in BTC (I do not accept any fiat anymore). The rest of my income also is in BTC from my normal job. Companies that I worked for, now they start hoarding BTC as money reserves, some they start paying more employees from those reserves, some start accepting BTC for their products/services (where were possible).  
Things are moving slowly in the right direction, but people have to have patience. Nothing is happening over the night.  
The most important thing is to have the right people around you and people willing to change their old mentality, the mentality of fiat.

Thank you very much for putting together all the dots! Good video!  
What people should understand is that [Bitcoin will be attacked in every aspect of it]( - Andreas was right and tried to warn us all.  
Bitconnect it was a form of attack actually. Somebody created that pyramid scheme, linked to Bitcoin in some way, just to create the false impression that THIS shit is Bitcoin, but in fact have nothing to do with Bitcoin.  
Then videos like this would be presented to the public as example: "look what you will get if you use Bitcoin".  
**This is a fucking attack against Bitcoin and Bitconnect is the weapon!**  
Mark my words, govs and banksters will use Bitconnect failure against Bitcoin itself, like they tried to use Silk Road against Bitcoin. Yes many users here will not fall into this trap, but think about the grandmas out there that will fall (again) in the gov/banksters trap.  
All those from this video... are just losers, that fall into all those scams.

To response almost to all your questions: if you **really** want to live on BTC, because of you are convinced about Bitcoin being the true way to get freedom from the banksters, **you have to forget using fiat, in any ways**.  
If you just want to play around, don't even think about it. Stay with fiat and buy BTC &amp; HODL just as a hobby or small investment thing.  
Going full on BTC is a hard process and first you will need to prepare your mind for that. First of all you need to understand what really is Bitcoin and why was invented. Bitcoin is not just a fancy new currency to play around because is trendy. It is far more than you can imagine and by just using it as money you will have an enormous power against the banksters and your government.  
Start with this: "When the people fear their government, there is tyranny. When the government fear their people, there is liberty". Satoshi started from this point also when he invented Bitcoin.  
I will give you more info when you are truly ready for this.

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.

1. Use offline this tool to generate a segwit wallet passphrase, with derivation path 49:   
1.a Save all the information generated into an encrypted file or somewhere safe.  
2. Use that passphrase into Electrum desktop wallet, select options/BIP39/Derivation path 49. Done you have your new segwit wallet.  
3. Use the same passphrase into Samourai mobile wallet. Done you have also the same wallet into your mobile (is good to have a backup or tandem mobile/desktop, you never know when one of those 2 you can't use it).  
Optional:  
- you can use PayNym feature of Samourai wallet to obfuscate your receiving address  
- you can use stealth mode of Samourai wallet, activate it only by a special PIN. The app will not shown up on your phone, only by that PIN. So a gun point theft will never know you have a hidden wallet. Keep an almost empty Mycelium wallet for the theft.

If we start comparing the GDP between African countries ( and EU countries ( there is a clear difference of buying power, in general. Of course we can't take the GDP measurement as the real way people could buy BTC. There are many aspects.  
But in general I could say that people from African continent they are more concentrated in buying food and water than BTC, right now.  
Yes, they could be helped if some companies goes there, start a business and pay the workers in BTC. Or companies going to African countries and import good &amp; services and pay with BTC. Then they will start trading between individuals in BTC.

Ok, you can do whatever you want with your BTC, but not with my privacy. Exposing me by using a 3rd party payment processor will be penalized: I will not use your services/products anymore. Slowly people will realize that privacy is more important than convenience.  
If I would want to use an intermediary I can just use fiat/visa/paypal, get fucked and get over it. I use Bitcoin because I do not want anybody to be between me and the receiver of my BTC, because Bitcoin is P2P decentralized.  
Why should I use a centralized system and intermediary when I have a powerful tool that empower me not do that?

20. The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.

Yes, there are more fees involved, but those fees are the price you are willing to pay in order to get rid of banksters. it's a small step, but let's not run to hills with no pants.   
If you just want to secure in some way your wealth, not for buying lambos and BS like that, but just to keep safe your money, yes, BTC is the safest place. Of course with the steps of securing well your wallets. For this way, I suggest the way I did it before I start living only on BTC.  
In 2012, when I realized the power of BTC, I start buying small amounts, at any price, anytime I had some cash available. I never stop buying, but NEVER sell. Then I start mining a bit with some GPUs and USBs. I made a good stash, but that is just for my daughter's future.  
I was drinking a lot those times, so I decided to drink less beer and with the money saved I bought BTC. Win/Win situation. The beers of those years brings me today the opportunity to pay entirely for a new car, but I don't. I am fine with actual car.  
Try like this, small steps, to no expose too much your life. Then slowly, find ways to make the big step.

Man, I really appreciate your enthusiasm in helping Bitcoin community, but I think you are concentrating too much effort for a lost cause. Try to focus your energy and knowledge on other parts where Bitcoin really need support.  
Centralizing info on BTC nodes is nor really necessary for Bitcoin success. There are so many other things that Bitcoin needs.  
If you really want to help, think about starting some LN nodes. This is the future and really helps Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2018-03-02 09:32:05
You better concentrate and build more important things if you are a talented developer. Join a wallet team.  
An app for watching users paper wallets it questionable, privacy intrusion etc. Almost any wallet app can have watch only address option. So having a dedicated app only for this, doesn't make too much sense.  
I am telling you as a friendly advice, I own a lot of offline wallets, with many BTC, but never use any app that can have only 0.0001% possibility to track in any way my wallets.  
This is why Bitcoin still doesn't have full anonymity: people are still linking their BTC addresses with real identity. And that's why they are fucked.  
Look I will give you an idea.  
Join a wallet team or create your own wallet app that include the following features:  
- users can see quickly merchants near them  
- based on their vicinity users can receive offers from merchants  
- buying from the merchants subscribed to that app offers, will give also points/tokens to the users  
- merchants join the wallet app with a special feature for employees (watch/receive only) and an owner mode (a PIN or whatever security)  
- merchants can create their offers ONLY for the same wallet app users  
- merchants pay to the wallet devs only a monthly fee, not too much, just to keep the developing alive. You don't have to rip off the merchants. Later you can create more Pro services for more money.  
With an app like this you bring together all parts: devs, merchants, users. Each one have his part. All happy.

I would love to see wallet features like:  
1. give incentive/tokens to users that actually pay with BTC merchants that uses the same wallet. Let's say the merchant also can create his own token/coin and for each purchase the user gets a token/coin/whatever. That incentive then could be used later for discounts/offers/vip campaigns etc  
2. Give more info to wallet users about merchants near by that uses same wallet/get tokens/know their offers. Make more interaction between users and merchants. Build a community.  
3. Only from these 2 aspects, wallet providers can earn also some good money. The door is open for innovation.  
I live on BTC from 2015 and I love to see more innovation in the relation user/merchant. This is what Bitcoin needs, not just ways of how to exchange quickly to fiat or back. Make tools that merchants want to use them, not just to accept BTC to sell it immediately for fiat because "it's too volatile". Volatility will slow down when people will stop following lambos and get rich quick and when they start paying their milk&amp;bread with BTC.

Conbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](

Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)

I would love to support your webshop (btw I like the domain name), but unfortunately is "Powered by Shopify"... that means they are forcing you to use their established 3rd party intermediaries to take BTC payments.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

None. Only P2P ones could be. So proceed with caution. Any exchange will be hacked, they are hacked every day, until we find out.  
My list of suggestion:  
 - P2P decentralized exchange, **strongly recommended**  
 - P2P centralized exchange, not so trusted anymore after they give away the user data to govs.  
 - buy from local stores in US  
 - buy from local carefour stores in ES  
 - ATM list  
 - buy btc at local shops in AT 
 - P2P exchange  
 - buy BTC with coupons in gas stations (EU)  
 - buy BTC with no account required, with cash to ATMs in EU  
I am sure there are many other P2P exchanges and will be much more after chinese exchanges ban...

I will never buy from a merchant that pass my payment through another intermediary.  
Satoshi created BTC exactly to avoid this.  
[Satoshi's papers]( the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
When I see that my payment is redirected to a Bitpay or Coinbase page I cancel the payment and never buy from that merchant (at least until he change his mind). Bitpay and Coinbase are exactly like Paypal, another bloodsucker like VISA. Enough with this!  
There are many plugins for WP sites that you can use with your OWN BTC wallet. Check Bitcoinway.com plugin. They have free and paid versions and works great with your Electrum wallet.  
Keep in mind this: Bitcoin is a P2P currency not a P2B2P....

For fuck sake are you nuts, recommending to a noob to use Conbase? That's like pushing him into a crocodile pit and say, ok now it's your problem how to swim out...  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](

Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.

But also I have many wallets hidden into some random texts, posted online or just in a simple email to your mom, containing those 12 words and only me knows the order, or location of them.  
Even here on Reddit I posted long time ago a text that contains 12 words from one of my wallets with 1 BTC in it. It is still there, I always check the balance :)

Just one advice: buy all the time you have some spare money, at any price, don't look to FUD just to dips. NEVER SELL. Use your BTC to buy stuff for living and then buy back +10% more.  
Don't drink 6 beers/day and only 1-2, the rest, keep the money and buy BTC every week, at any price.  
Try to earn BTC, being paid in BTC or use Bitwage.com to start.

Is not unrealistic if they really want it.  
Things start happen, at a low level but that is the most important thing.  
I will tell you a case.  
I start being paid in BTC in 2015 so I start asking merchants if they accept BTC.  
A local grocery store, run by a pakistani, was happy to accept my BTC. He shared his wallet with his family in Pakistan and is more than happy to accept my BTC.  
But soon he have more BTC accumulated so he start asking some of his providers if they accept BTC (local gardeners, stuff like that).  
From that moment he started a wonderful business because was enough that only one supplier accepted BTC and some other also jumped in.  
Soon my landlord, that I pay him in BTC the rent, started to buy in the same grocery with BTC.  
**The Bitcoin Revolution start from local levels and only with the will of users, not govs**.  
So spend your BTC at local shops and explain them to do the same. That will start a small wheel to roll over and over again and not depend on a financial intermediary anymore!

Stop thinking about those cards.  
Why bother to get into Bitcoin if you go back to fiat, banks &amp; cards. Those cards are VISA cards and have nothing to do with all Bitcoin features. [Those cards are the worst implementation of Bitcoin](  
There are tons of places where to spend your BTC directly, with no intermediary or exchange.  
Me myself I bought, mined, earn BTC from 2012 and from 2015 I live exclusively on BTC, with no bank accounts or visa cards. If I couldn't buy something with BTC, I make it possible, I convinced people around me to accept my BTC, I convinced people to pay for my work in BTC.  
This revolution in financial system is not based on what other big companies do, but what you as individual do.

Nice try shill for Conbase... now all nobbs will start making accounts on Conbase and get fucked.  
**Warning for noobs** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](

Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)

I wasn't referring to obtain profit later. They could easily just keep it and/or using it to pay directly with BTC.  
I really don't like people to throw away immediately the  BTC they get and not even think about using them as MONEY. They think that BTC is only an asset or payment method and is wrong.   
People should make this effort to try to close the circle, by using BTC as money, between people.

Warning to all merchants that want to accept BTC as payment method.  
Merchants, do your job correctly, if you really want to take BTC, there are many ways to do it in the right way, without any intermediary (as Conbase or Bitpay).  
Do not violate your customer rights and privacy by forcing them to pay with BTC through a payment processor (3rd party).  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid these and give freedom and full P2P payment solution between customer and merchant.
**Reminder [Satoshi's papers]( stated: Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Bitcoin doesn't need any intermediary to track, monitor, control my BTC payment. There are many solutions in place that gives you FREE and full control of all the process. Don't let others to interfere between you and your customer. For that shit we have fiat. If you still want an intermediary, use the fucking fiat and VISA.  
You have been warned!  
Like it or not, this warning will raise more questions and make more people think about this and bring again the question: **why the fuck Satoshi created Bitcoin in the first place?**

[I recommend you to watch this video about Bitcoin political missconceptions]( and then think again "how good were those banksters by giving you easiness to get into BTC".  
There are hundreds of ways to use BTC without giving up your freedoms and privacy. That's why Bitcoin was created in the first place: to give you a tool to protect your freedom and privacy.

Look nice but.... "Powered by Shopify".  
That means you are forced to use predetermined 3rd parties for BTC payments as Bitpay/Conbase.  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
These links are a must read for all those who get NOW into Bitcoin so they will know about this issue and who are the perpetrators:  
  
  
   
  
  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.

Nice to see a new exchange and also from Spain. But I read the FAQs and is not clear at all the fees system. Actually is missing totally.  
Also in About us, at the "Partners" section I see only 3 big banks. So this exchange is funded and controlled by those banks?  
Is this new exchange like Bitnovo or have relations with them?  
Is quite strange that I have to trust an exchange that hide the real owners of the domain behind 1and1.es domain registrar. Is hard to trust like that. Just an office in a central building is not enough, they can go from there anytime. At least put more company info on the website.

This will be the real scenario until more and more people will start closing the circle: living only on BTC. I live on BTC from 2015 and my circle is closed.  
1. Merchants stop exchanging immediately the BTC you obtained from customers, pay your employees, suppliers, bills with BTC.  
2. People, start demanding to be paid in BTC or at least use Bitwage to get in.  
3. Everybody should refuse to use fiat.

I convinced many merchants near me to accept BTC and none of them wants to sell the BTC for fiat. Now they pay their employees or buy from other merchants in BTC.  
My landlord also take my rent in BTC and he pays some cleaning personnel in BTC.  
If a merchant doesn't understand why should use BTC and keep it or use it, better don't bother to convince him.  
I live on BTC from 2015 with no bank accounts anymore. it is possible if many people around you will use it too. So start the way around: convince and educate people what really is BTC and then start taking payments from them in BTC.  
Even if a merchant will start accepting BTC and will not sell those BTC for fiat, keeping them will not affect in any way his cash flow, because of the low amount. They can consider it as a safe reserve not in a bank, that in time grow in value.  
Is really stupid to sell your BTC immediately after you obtain them.

All merchants dealing BTC through an intermediary/3rd party should stop this right now. They are doing more harm to themselves and to their customers. These merchants violate the definition of Bitcoin.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase page, I will cancel the payment and NEVER use that merchant again. I live on BTC only from 2015 and I do a lot of BTC payments. I know what I am talking about.

There are many online merchants that you can pay directly with BTC. Also there are many services that allow you to pay your fiat bills with BTC (aka bitwala, bylls etc).  
I manage because I convinced a lot of merchants around me to accept my BTC. I convinced the landlord to accept my rent in BTC, I convinced the gas station near me to accept my BTC and a grocery store also. None of them make it public, but we have an agreement: I pay only in BTC wallet to wallet. And they are happy with that.

Shopify webshop, that means Bitpay intermediary.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

Then start paying the rent in BTC.  
Then buying only with BTC online and looking for local shops adoption.  
Then paying groceries to local shop in BTC.  
Then start paying bills with services like Bitwala.  
Then paying gas to local station in BTC.  
Then closing all bank accounts, no need them anymore.

Same question apply for people using the state's pension system. It's a pyramid scheme, obviously, but nobody dare to say it's a pyramid scheme.

[Here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet), otherwise [you will end up with something like this](  
1. Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
2. Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
3. Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
4. Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
5. Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

A real bitcoiner that really wants to pay with BTC, knows very well that in these days confirmations are slow, so a an upfront payment will not be "weird", due to your specific service, they have to wait anyway.  
Also a 1 confirmation payment is enough.  
My example: from 2015 I pay my groceries to a local shop run by a neighbor that accept BTC. I just pay and go, never wait for confirmation. Both we know that soon in minutes the payment is done. In 2 years NEVER have a problem. Yes, there is a trust between us, because I will not go to another shop to buy because they still not accept BTC and he knows that I will pay anyway.  
May The Coin Be With You!

BULLSHIT  
The author didn't mention at all **why those are "the best"** exchanges. Is just his opinion or of the payers behind this shit article.  
There is no best exchange. Each exchange will have his own bad or good features, but the most important thing is: is that the exchange you are using respect your privacy, secure well your money ?  
He forget to mention:  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

What's wrong with anarchy? Anarchy always bring a nice order.  
Oh no, don't tell me you fall into media BS lies that say anarchy = terrorism. Is exactly what they show you to not look further in what really is anarchy.  
Anarchy is the condition of a society, entity, group of people, or a single person that rejects hierarchy.[1][2] The word originally meant leaderlessness, but in 1840 Pierre-Joseph Proudhon adopted the term in his treatise What Is Property? to refer to a new political philosophy: anarchism, which advocates stateless societies based on voluntary associations. In practical terms, anarchy can refer to the curtailment or abolition of traditional forms of government and institutions. It can also designate a nation (or anywhere on earth that is inhabited) that has no system of government or central rule.  
Bitcoin can fit very well in an anarchist society. Will give power to each person, in equal part, to decide directly what to do with his own money. No need for a gov/authority to decide for each individual.

Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

My procedure was like this:  
1. Mycelium wallet passphrase used in Electrum wallet to recover the wallet  
2. In Electrum, after waiting to full sync, go to each address and right click and see "private key"  
3. Each private key, use it in Coinomi wallet (be careful to select BCH wallet not BTC) to sweep them  
4. Use the built in shapeshift exchange from Coinomi wallet or just use shapeshift.io, changelly.com or any other exchange that support BCH/BTC  
5. Send your new BTC to a new BTC address.  
Done! You just have new 0.125BTC per each BCH. Not too much but it's free :)

Use BTCpay, Bitcoinpay or many others that are NOT acting as intermediary for your BTC payment.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to an intermediary page (Bitpay or Coinbase), I cancel that payment and never use that merchant again, until he fix the problem.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
A merchant that uses an intermediary for his BTC payments VIOLATES the definition of Bitcoin and with that betray the user trust itself! If they really want to use an intermediary, they have fiat/visa/mastercard for that no need for Bitcoin.  
Merchants, do not come up with the pathetic excuse of "convenience", there are many ways to accept BTC without any intermediary, there is no excuse for giving up the trust and freedom of your customers!

1. Use this tool offline   
2. Generate a segwit BIP39 passphrase  
3. Save all the details necessary  
4. Open latest Electrum, create new wallet, based on passphrase you already have. When you paste the seed, use the "options" button and select BIP39. Next step will ask you to set the Derivation code for your wallet. So change 44 with 49 (segwit enabler).  
5. Done, you have now a full segwit wallet in your Electrum.  
You can use the same passphrase on Samourai mobile wallet, having in this way the same wallet on desktop and mobile.

Warning to all merchants that want to accept BTC as payment method.  
Merchants, do your job correctly, if you really want to take BTC, there are many ways to do it in the right way, without any intermediary (as Conbase or Bitpay).  
Do not violate your customer rights and privacy by forcing them to pay with BTC through a payment processor (3rd party).  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid these and give freedom and full P2P payment solution between customer and merchant.
**Reminder [Satoshi's papers]( stated: Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Bitcoin doesn't need any intermediary to track, monitor, control my BTC payment. There are many solutions in place that gives you FREE and full control of all the process. Don't let others to interfere between you and your customer. For that shit we have fiat. If you still want an intermediary, use the fucking fiat and VISA.  
You have been warned!

[Here is a good resource for wallets]( Don't ask people to post their preferences here, you will get the most amazing shit answers regarding preferences and will just create more confusion.  
In Bitcoinlandia there is no central source to "guide" you the right path. Your own education, instinct, capacity to detect fud and scams will guide you to the best path/product/service.  
Even this, do not believe what I am just telling you, just think for yourself, what are your needs, expectations, preferences etc. Then go to a page like I just share with you, where you could see (without going to install all the wallets/apps) all the features of almost all wallets. Don't bother to look into how many stars or reviews have each one (are very susceptible). Important is that the wallet you like have the most of your own requirements.

Sorry, I would like to support your efforts but... shopify webshops are forced to use a 3rd party intermediary for BTC payments.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

There is no such thing of taxes in BTC. Taxes are only for fiat money (slave money).  
Let's say: I sell 1 thing for $100 and instead of $ I received BTC amount of $100. My tax report will be sales of $100 not 0.1BTC. Taxman doesn't care how you received those $100, he's interest is in you making that fucking slave report of $100 sales.

yes, the station in my neighborhood. A good talk with the owner and he starts taking my BTC. When he saw that also my landlord takes also BTC for my rent, he was amazed to HODL some. He still don't want to make too much noise about it (putting a B sign), so he just accept BTC from me and my landlord for the moment. But is a start, because also a bar and a grocery in the same area are taking our BTC. Is not hard to convince people if you know how to explain them and find the way that BTC is solving THEIR problems.

You better check bitwage.com. Going back to plastic cards (aka fiat) is NOT an option.  
There is no any "trick", just the desire to get rid of banksters - use your damn BTC wallet and be free.  
When people start realizing that they are enslvaed by the banksters with their fiat, they will start looking into BTC. Until then they are just blind and brainwashed by their govs.
A so called ["bitcoin debit card"]( is just another banksters trick to fool you to keep you using their worthless goat shit fiat!  
All these cards are a propaganda for using VISA. Satoshi created Bitcoin EXACTLY to get rid of these bloodsuckers!  
**Use your damn BTC wallet instead of all these bloodsuckers intermediaries.  
A reminder to all those that didn't read [Satoshi's papers]( the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Never forget this!

Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)

But by using a DEX, you lower the number of factors that will affect your privacy to just one - the other party of exchange.  
For a gov will be really hard to infiltrate and track every move on all DEXs.  
I can create hundreds of accounts on one DEX, hundreds on others and never have the same txs. I can do this for a while until will dry all my fiat resources buying BTC and then I would say: enough, I don't have to buy anymore, I will just live off BTC (as I do today).
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:21:14
DEXs will never be a HVT. Are just gateways that offer more security, privacy and liberty when people want to buy/sell their BTC/cryptos.  
DEXs can't have price manipulation, because of the strict internal rules will make almost impossible for these tactics. The exchange rates will be more clean and real based on real demand and offer.  
Nobody knows how a centralized exchange manipulate the orders, the volume, the access in crowded moments (see the latest "glitches" in trading on platforms like Conbase). We just have to trust them that they are playing fair (and they not).

Definitely the media (with their banksters behind) started to attack Bitcoin with all guns.  
First it was drug dealers/Silk Road using Bitcoin... uhhh so bad no?  
Then mining Bitcoin was a climate change factor because it uses lots of energy to mine BTC... uhhh so bad!  
Then ISIS/terrorists uses Bitcoin to fund their attacks... uhhh so bad is this Bitcoin!  
Now is North Korea that is "making" money by hacking/mining... uhhh definitely we should shut down this bad boy Bitcoin!

My way to hide some of my wallets is:  
1. take the seed words and insert/use them in a normal story text. Take that text and use it as an email sent to your mother/family or post it on a webpage/your own webpage, whatever other online place from where you could restore the text and extract your words, known only by you.  
2. take the seed and insert it into a nice picture using the technique of steganography. [An example here]( That picture file you could save it on several locations online, in plain sight, nobody will know what contains. I have one in my living room so every day I am looking to "my wallet" :)  
3. use a password manager app to store your wallet details. Take that pwd manager database file and store it on an usb thumb drive encrypted (when you plug it will ask for a pwd). Put on that usb your encrypted wallet files, seeds, databases, important info etc). Make more copies of that usb and store them in separate places. I have one hidden into a time capsule for my daughter, under a tree, deep in a forest.  
Save in a text file all your public addresses of those hidden wallets, so you could always send BTC to those wallets, without opening them, like a personal address book. I usually save them into my regular daily usage wallets (electrum have that option too).  
Be inventive, there are many ways to secure and hide your wallets.

Yes, is good that they get money to continue the developing. For a bitcoin project this is crucial.  
But what about funding the project  with money from us, all the community, in a fair, open, decentralized way.  
Not taking money directly from crooks, banksters and people that just want to destroy Bitcoin.  
If they would come with an announcement like: "hey the devs of OB we are struggling with this project, we need money, are you willing to participate openly?" , for sure many people would help them. And even implementing more coins into the payment system would be agreed if it is open.  
But they preferred to be funded and controlled by Jihad.  
I was even promoting OB here many times, I use it to buy stuff, I use it to sell stuff, it was good but now... OB is done, terminated in this phase!

Yes, I have to admit it, if weren't the case that I started in 2012 to accumulate BTC it wouldn't be easy for me to start living only with BTC. It was a well planned transition starting with being paid in BTC and pay the rent in BTC.  
Just an example, my 1st year on BTC paid my rent with BTC bought in 2012 for just couple of hundreds bucks.  
I paid off all my debts with BTC mined back in 2012-2013.  
From 2015 I start clean, just earning, spending and HODLing in BTC.

That means they are forced to use Bitpay or Conbase payment system. Sorry for ruining your announcement but I have to warn the users that do not know the details.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries). There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
  
  
  
  
You should really take in consideration this: 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:32:37


You are the receiver of  BTC, so will never be scammed by receiving money that can't be reversed.  
Secondly: Bitcoin IS CASH. That's why that greek wants to pay you in BTC because a greek will always appreciate what really is money (aka Bitcoin, not the worthless goat shit fiat).  
If you plan to take the BTC for immediate selling, don't do it.  
If you plan to take the BTC to HODL for life, do it but with a proper wallet that respect [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( Samourai, Electrum, Coinomi, Schildbach would be the easiest to open.  
But first things first you need more education about how to store and secure your bitcoins. So please read the educational links on the right panel -----&gt; It is for your own good.

Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](

Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

I do this "Bitcoin consultancy" for about 3 years now. I do it because people around me ask me to do it for them. It wasn't something that I wanted to do. This consulting job brings me like 30% of my income in BTC, now, with no effort. I do not accept any fiat money, only BTC. Those who still do not have BTC I give them free advice and consultancy until they have BTC.  
Who knows, maybe soon I will leave my normal IT job and go full in BTC consulting. Could be a new boom in this area.  
I started too with friends but now those friends brings more people to me.  
Is quite easy job if you are well informed and know how to listen your "clients" and find the best solution for each case. The only "hard" part is how to stay up to date with all this overwhelming flood of innovation in the field. Almost every day appear something new.  
For all those of you out there, if you are well enough educated in the Bitcoin field, start doing this "bitcoin consultancy". Educating others, will help you and also Bitcoin.   
Even if you start low, with just some friends, small advice, all these little thing can build something beautiful. Don't fall into the chimera of "trading consultancy", That is a total BS and you could lose all your friends for that. Go for real Bitcoin education. People and in special merchants need to know more about what Bitcoin is and how they can do amazing things with it.  
Like Andreas said: "educating others, you educate yourself more". I try to help people around me with using BTC, nothing more.

I live on BTC from 2015 and closed all bank accounts. I do not care about exchange rates of BTC. Now I have a better life, I always win &amp; HODL.  
Just make your own calculations: let's say for ONLY 1 year. Start with 1 wage, if you use only fiat and if you only use BTC (not going back and exchange it in fiat when you need to pay something). If you take only the part of your money that you remain after you pay all your expenses and instead of putting them into a savings account, in 1 year you double it in value. There is no bank in this world that will give you that income. Just HODL, never sell.

Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid intermediaries like these in a tx between 2 parties. You better pay with fiat and leave your BTC for other merchants.

Mass adoption will never happen. But adoption will be and this depend of each one of us. Buying just a cup of coffee with BTC will never make you a real "bitcoiner".  
Start by closing your bank accounts and accept ONLY BTC for your work/services/products. Then you became a small wheel that start moving things in the right direction.  
Ask yourself: what did you do to help Bitcoin to thrive?  
Me? I did it in 2015: closed all my bank accounts and used ONLY BTC from then.

I buy my groceries from the shop next to my building, run by a nice pakistani guy that feeds his family with my BTC, in Pakistan. every time I pay in BTC I get 10% discount.  
There are tons of places online to buy your groceries, just look closer.  
My income is coming from my employer that pays me directly to my BTC wallet, from company wallet. Each payment is done a new address, that is shapeshifted of course. This happen from 2015, after I convinced the company to keep some money reserve in BTC. They start doing it instead of leaving the money in the bank. Now they start paying more people in BTC.  
Before this I used Bitwage.com, the employer pays normally the payroll to a bank account, that is linked to my Bitwage account, then I receive BTC straight to my wallet. No more hassle to buy, to look at the price. Fuck the price! I always win.

You nail it here. I live on BTC from 2015, so I have to spend almost every day some BTC. Sometimes I am thinking the same: why am I spending my BTC? And I have the same answer: I am not greedy to see in my hands shitload of worthless goat shit fiat. I just want a normal life, living on BTC.  
Many will say that "you can't live on BTC today", my answer is YES, if you really want it and your greed is in normal position OFF. Focus on your future 3-5-10 years and you will see that BTC you obtain today will pay your living of next year. Every month, every year you will pay less and less BTC for living. For much you spend it, much you will pay less and less so you will have also for HODLing.

**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:46:49
I think that majority of all those news about "seizing" BTC are just FUD, bombastic titles to spread fear. I never saw any proof that a gov agency took full control of those BTC.  
They usually said seize for confiscating an USB drive, a laptop, HW wallet but that doesn't mean they have full control of the BTC.  
The owner of those BTC can easily have a backup in other place and in that moment the gov get nothing. REKT.  
Yes, now maybe there are cases when the BTC owners get tortured or forced to give up passwords, but that is not anymore seizing, is just robbery at gun point.  
A tiny % of cases could be that a dumb BTC owner leave his wallet open/decrypted in the moment get fucked by police and a smart police change his access/take over the control. That is a real seizing.  
People should have in mind one thing: **there is no way that somebody can seize your BTC without your consent/collaboration!** But in that moment you are a miserable coward. NEVER GIVE UP YOUR KEYS!

Bisq is the new name of Bitsquare, a decentralized P2P exchange. Please read their FAQs, philosophy and watch their videos and you will understand one important thing: for a P2P decentralized currency you need also a P2P decentralized exchange.  
Decentralized, means no gov can shut it down like chinese.  
P2P means the exchange is directly between 2 parties, no intermediary.

@_date: 2018-02-27 08:53:04


No thanks!  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries). There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.    
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
** Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**

is just a trap. Don't be fooled by the name of "vault", is a false assumption of security.  
That "vault" could be easier your own paper/steel wallet or HW wallet stored in a safe/hidden place, known only by you.  
[Just an example here of how you could create your own hidden vault](  
Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters and will always act like a bank (aka fuck you). If you still are a fool to trust a bank, go ahead use Coinbase vault, but **you have been warned!**

No need for a 3rd party to know both identities and make the payment. We fight to get rid of this old system and you now want to go back to that shit. NO WAY!

@_date: 2017-09-17 21:25:36
Nope. Each individual/user if will use BTC as money, will push the merchants to accept it.  
Note: I live on BTC from 2015 and I know how is it. First it was difficult, but once I convinced my landlord to accept my BTC, then the rest around wanted some BTC and the wheel start rolling over and over, faster and faster.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:10:03

You have to convince all the users/participants of Bitcoin to agree on changing that limit. If just a part of the users decide to do it without everybody consent, then they will just create another useless altcoin (see BCH).  
That's why will never happen.  
Andreas A. in his Q&amp;A sessions have the perfect answer to your question and many others. I strongly suggest to watch all of them: 
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:01:12

Yes, in the past I took a small bank credit to buy some BTC. I did it and I pay it back quickly.  
But the best way to reach your goal is to be constant in your buys. I started in 2012 buying, mining, earning BTC but never sell. I bought at whatever price anytime I had some spare cash.  
May The Coin Be With You and I wish you will have not 10 but 21 BTC :)

WP + Woocommerce + Bitcoinway.com plugin + **YOUR** Electrum wallet.  
No intermediaries, no fees, you control all your money.  
There is no need for an intermediary in a Bitcoin payment process.  
Bitcoin ITSELF is a "payment processor". No need for other intermediary (aka bloodsucker).  
A reminder to all those that didn't read [Satoshi's papers]( the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Your "payment processor" is YOUR own BTC wallet!  
Another way is to setup an Open Bazaar shop only for BTC payments, you could redirect your clients that want to pay with BTC to your OB shop.  
Another way is to setup your own code for payment with BTC using Electrum wallet documentation.  
Again: **No need for an intermediary!**

The first ones, I just keep then in a steel wallet deep inside a forest, never use them, are for my grand-grand-grand kids. So I use regularly only those with 1BTC each.

I will tell you something.  
In 2012 I heard first time about BTC and I start mining, then I start buying it (at any price, anytime I had some spare money), I start selling stuff for BTC, I start working for BTC (being paid in BTC for my work).  
But never sell any of my BTC for fiat money. Yes I use BTC to buy stuff, pay bills, rent, live.  
Once, my own daughter was sick and I had to pay some stuff extra. But I didn't sell any BTC, I was trying to pay that extra stuff with BTC but at that moment they didn't accept it, so I asked a friend if he agree to pay for me in fiat and I would give him the BTC. That friend now, is so grateful to me that all the time he's paying the beers.

You are very confused.  
Crypto world is like a train. Bitcoin is the locomotive and the rest of altcoins or whatever fedcoin you want are the wagons.  
A wagon never could be the locomotive, because by design, doesn't have the locomotive engine and features.  
Even if somebody will try to design a new locomotive, would be a fork of the original locomotive, but then you have to convince the travelers to jump on that train that is a copy of the original locomotive, but they are not insured that the new train will arrive at the same destination as they want. So many will stick with the original locomotive because they know for sure that they will still arrive at their destination.

I took a bill of €20 and put some chocolate on it in some way that look as shit.  
Then go to the store and when it was about to pay I handed to him in the way he can see the "shit". He not even want to touch it, so I asked: I can pay with BTC if you like and is not even necessary to touch anything, it's just like magic.  
So I throw away on the floor that €20 bill and pull out my phone, showing him how to pay with BTC wallet.  
Then he get interested and we end up in paying him in BTC.  
I never take back that €20 from the floor and I think nobody took it. Worthless goat shit fiat.

Satoshi gave us this wonderful and powerful tool to fight the banksters, it's our duty to continue his work, by using it as MONEY!  
Continuing to use fiat, you are giving up every day more freedom and rights and became more enslaved by the banksters.

As a person that start living on Bitcoin in 2015 I believe that those merchants that, in these turbulent days of Bitcoin, they start accepting BTC deserve not just attention but more support by paying them in BTC. I convinced many merchants around me to take my BTC and I see their struggle to do that. But all of them are driven by a strong force and determination that Bitcoin will bring them financial freedom and prosperity.  
I salute all merchants that have this courage! All my respects.

At least you could offer a service like was Cashila and Bitwala, to pay your bills with BTC.  
But "promoting" your new services as "cashing out" sounds like you want people to throw away their valuable BTC for the worthless goat shit fiat.  
I understand that your services are ramp for the transition period, but you started makes me very suspicious for your intentions.  
If you want to approach the Bitcoin community, give them solutions to keep their BTC or use BTC and additionally fiat services. You have to realize that in few years all those IBAN accounts are useless.  
Here are many that doesn't need anymore bank accounts.  
You could present your services here like Bitwage for example: offering to people that wants to receive their salary in BTC, the solution, the employer pays to an IBAN, the users receive BTC in their Trastra account. If they have to pay bills with fiat, pay from the same account. If they want to withdraw BTC, they can do it from the same account. If they want to spend using a VISA card, they can do it from the same account. Yes this can be an approach.  
But cpoming here saying: hey throw your BTC we give you some shit fiat for them... is not good.

There is no "best" wallet in  Bitcoinlandia. There are only 2 categories:  
- the ones that respect [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](  
- the ones that doesn't respect that rule.  
Choose wisely from this list:   
There is also a way of organizing your btc, like we always say: Bitcoin = Be your own bank, act accordingly.  
That means:  
- use hardware/paper/steel wallets for keeping large amount of BTC for HODLING (savings accounts),  
- use desktop wallets, for regular spend, medium txs  
- use mobile wallets, just to have some change for a beer or "corrupting" some new friends newbies.  
Each wallet have his own features and functionalities that will fit more or less your needs and habits. Try more than 1 wallet and see which one is best for you, but I strongly suggest to split your btc into many types of wallets and addresses.  
Be the new bankster :) !

BTCPay is the best solution, with no intermediary, easy to setup, no need super skills.  
If you do not understand what is about Bitcoin you better stick with fiat. Just accepting for accepting it is not enough. You violate your customers rights and privacy, that is what you are doing when you use a 3rd party. And many will avoid you as merchant for that.

My goal is not to get rich from Bitcoin. My focus is how to get more freedom from the banksters. Then the wealth comes more and more.  
Did you realize that the actual rich guys, for more money they have, more freedoms and privileges they have?  
Instead the actual poor ones, for less money they have, less freedom and rights they get?  
So my way is a bit different: first I am gonna get more freedom/power/rights (by using ONLY BTC)  then I will let the wealth coming to me.  
Let's change the game rules a bit, to see what happen. Let's give more freedom to the poor ones and less money to the rich ones. If we stop using fiat, the rich ones will have less and less money. Or at least not all, some of them a bit smart will start buying BTC, but actually they do not use it as money. By that, will make us a favor.

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
A merchant that uses an intermediary for his BTC payments VIOLATES the definition of Bitcoin and with that betray the user trust itself! If they really want to use an intermediary, they have fiat/visa/mastercard for that no need for Bitcoin.

You should move your mouse scroll on zooming out the price chart. Look at the big picture not the 15min chart...  
And keep in mind this: it is the USD/EUR/fiat that loses value not BTC. The more you pay in fiat for 1BTC represent the less purchasing power of your fiat money.  
Look for at least 1h at  and see graphically what really happen.  
What you see now is that people start losing faith in fiat money so they don't care how much they have to spend fiat to buy BTC. That's why the dips do not stay long and the price is going up quickly: people are buying at large BTC and dump the fiat.

Please save my advice for later: you have 19 years, those BTC are your retirement plan. Don't be excited now for the "incredible" amount of 50 bucks extra. Those are nothing compared with what you will buy with those BTC in the near future.  
Move those BTC to a REAL wallet (Conbase is a bank not a wallet) and keep it safe. Start putting every month some spare fiat money into BTC. Think into your future not today's "get quick rich scheme" chimera.

No, anarchies were always in human history, but never lasted. After each anarchy is natural to come an order.  
That nice order, always was hijacked by those who want more power (no matter which "ism" was) and manipulate the masses to get into their "ism".  
But that was possible because people didn't have a real tool to protect themselves against "power suckers".  
Now we have Bitcoin and the game's rules are changing in people's favor.  
You will see, it will be a nice anarchy followed by a nice order, the order of people. It will be nasty, I have no doubts, but that's why it is wise to acquire now some BTC and be ready for the chaos. Later you could use your BTC to bring order.

Instead of "preferred wallets" it should be **preferred wallet features and functions**.  
Or maybe we should make a list of feature request for all wallets, so the devs can see them and take into consideration to implement some or all.  
Preferences for a certain wallet are very subjective/suspicious/deceiving and in a decentralized world as Bitcoinlandia we should focus more on features not on "preferred" apps.  
A Bitcoin wallet in the end is just an interface for managing your private keys and that interface will have more or less features that will give you more privacy, security, easiness to use, UI, fun. Maybe I will use 1 wallet for business purpose and 1 wallet for personal use.

Yes I use a shared wallet, with multisig, with my wife, but that contains only BTC for regular monthly spend.  
Yes, I have a nice wallpaper in a room, that contains the passphrase for a wallet. If it would be decypher correctly they can find a nice 10BTC wallet. [An example here]( Use steganography to obtain that.  
Also I have other wallets hidden in plain sight: the 12-24 words could be inserted very easily into a normal innocent text, story, academic or love letter. That text could be posted then in many places, for backups (email to your mother, a webpage, a post here on reddit, or any other way to post online and stay almost forever there).

The "value" of BTC you see increasing is actually the USD devaluation. When fiat will die/disappear forever, you will see a stability in BTC price and will not be reported anymore to USD/fiat. We are still ate the beginning of the journey and is normal that people start using it as a store of value, not because is so good at this, but because there is no other asset to use it as store of value in such a good way as BTC.  
Look at the gold now, for years is quite steady in price so not so more investors are buying it.  
Bitcoin on the other way, have a really nice future. Yes today we struggle with all these forks and fights, but hey, who is starting these fights? The banksters, because they are afraid of BTC future and they know that with BTC they can't lie forever with their shity worthless goat shit fiat.  
Patience, the time for Bitcoin will come.  
BTW, I live only on BTC from 2015 so for me BTC is money, works perfect for me as currency. I am paid in BTC, I pay my expenses in BTC and I HODL what remains. It is perfect for me. I don't give a shit about price fluctuations, forks and manipulations. More important for me is that I can trade and live freely.  
r/LivingOnBitcoin is real and are more and more people that really live on BTC, because they want it.

Yes, Patrick is a real Bitcoin supporter, but the decision of Overstock to use Coinbase as payment processor is contradictory to the definition of Bitcoin itself:  
[Satoshi's papers]( the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
That's why when I see a merchant that redirect my payment to a Coinbase page I will cancel the payment and never use that merchant until they fix the "problem". Bitcoin was designed to be a P2P currency not a P2B2P...

Yet again people are fooled by the banksters with these cards.  
There is no such thing of "bitcoin debit card". Bitcoin can't be debited. You have your bitcoins, or you have nothing.  
All those cards are just another banksters trick to fool people to still use fiat, keeping in them in debt slavery.  
All these cards are a propaganda for using VISA. Satoshi created Bitcoin EXACTLY to get rid of these bloodsuckers!  
**Use your damn BTC wallet instead of all these bloodsuckers intermediaries.  
A reminder to all those that didn't read [Satoshi's papers]( the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

They use Bitpay as intermediary...  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
  
  
  
  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**

You are close but not enough...  
Banksters create/hijack their own "coin" aka ETH (see recent news about partnership ETH - russian gov).  
They let BTC to be used, just to get more and more people used to cryptos, but then they will push hard for using their "fedcoin". The stupid sheeple that still not get into BTC, will fall into their trap and then will start the real currency war: BTC-ETH.  
It's up to us how much we can keep BTC clean of shit and decentralized. Otherwise we are doomed.  
I am inclined to believe that Satoshi was part of a larger group that was preparing a One World Currency project long before we were thinking about. But Satoshi was too smart and in secret created his own FREEDOM currency. That's why we see now so many altcoins, 99% of these altcoins are failed coins launched by banksters, just to divide and try to conquer the sheeple. It's a simple game that they are playing for centuries.

Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.

Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)

Why do you think [BBVA was "investing" in Coinbase]( Obtaining sensitive information about users is a good start and worth a lot of money, more than initial investment.  
People are really stupid and give up their freedom in exchange for some change and nice interfaces. But they do not realize that THEY ARE THE PRODUCT!  
Now BBVA with all that info obtained can do whatever they want with it.  
Like Circle (aka Goldman Sachs) did.  
Like GetGemz (aka Citibank) did.

Never try to compare any altcoin with BTC. Will never work and is useless. That's why are named "altcoins".  
Altcoins have only one usage: shapeshift your BTC.  
You can do whatever you want with your altcoin Nano, but you will never have a Nano as a Bitcoin. For the simple fact that Bitcoin was the first one.  
We can debate here a lot about features, developing, algorithms etc, but is wasting time.

I do not doubt your honesty. I doubt Bitpay. Is time for you to look into other solutions like BTCPay. Bitpay is not playing honestly at all.  


Again, why that hassle to exchange immediately the BTC to fiat, when you can just take fiat ?  
Use that BTC to pay your employees, suppliers, bills etc. but don't go back to fiat. That is really lame and stupid. Is like the customers coming and give you BTC and you throw them away because you don't want them.

There is no any connection between Bitcoin (as protocol, network, payment) and exchanges. Are two different things. Regulation means control. In a decentralized world there is no mean for control. Only trust.

That's why I always said: never rely only on one wallet app.  
You could generate a wallet and use the passphrase on many different apps.  
As far you control all the time your bitcoin keys, is nothing to worry. A wallet app is just an interface for reading your wallet. No need to freak out just because that interface have technical issues. Move on to the next wallet app and use normally your BTC. Let's not forget that all these wallets are SPV clients not full wallets.  
The combination of iancoleman.io wallet generator, samourai and electrum is the best example on how you could manage 100% your wallet on different platforms/apps.

With very few exceptions when the BTC was sold in auctions, gov DO NOT held any private keys or control those BTC.  
Seizing a laptop/computer that contains a wallet doesn't mean the gov seized that wallet.  
They can take my computer or mobile, but I can control my wallet from anywhere in the world, from any other device. They suck it, they can never access that wallet and will never have access to that wallet.  
Stop spreading the false idea that gov agencies **can seize your bitcoins**. IS TOTALLY FALSE. Nobody can have control of your wallets without your consent.

I am just waiting a bit more to convince all owners to accept only BTC for the whole place.  
Then I will start recovering the old village, bring more partners/neighbors and start a real Bitcoin community, trying to live free and sustainable. I don't want fancy luxury stuff, just comfortable, clean, nice, original rural village with some modern infrastructures (water, solar power, gardens, sewage, satellite internet).  
I have more than enough BTC for my part, but my friends will have to do their part, is like each on their own but common things we put together the funds.  
Will be a nice, private and freedom lovers village. Maybe we will invite Andreas when will be more or less ready for visitors.

Wrong approach, will not work. They are not interested (for the time being) into cut those VISA.  
Most of the merchants are only interested into: MONEY, MONEY, MONEY and most of them doesn't give a fuck about Bitcoin, because they know shit about it.  
Go for another approach, more human, more logical.  
Organize meetups and invite customers and merchants, put them together to discuss, problems, issues, solutions. You will be just the mediator that intervene with small tips about Bitcoin. Let them discover Bitcoin and how can be used to solve specific problems.  
Me personally I did (for years) what you purpose now, and didn't work. I changed the tactic and now almost all shops in my neighborhood accept BTC and I live happily on BTC from 2015. Depends also what kind of people you have around you.

Definitely scam. If they really want to promote use of BTC and raise their sales, then make a campaign that says: next month for all orders of $100 paid with BTC you get a 10% discount.

Oh no, not again another "powered by Shopify" tied to Bitpay/Conbase...  
Seem that now Bitpay/Conbase are pushing all these "announcements" to promote their shity payment system.  
Look I would love to see many merchants accepting BTC, but when I see that everybody just jump into the wolf pit, without even looking to many other solutions, makes me think that those merchants are lobotomized and/or are Bitpay/Conbase shills. In the last month here, I saw so many "new shops" using Shopify/Bitpay/Conbase that sounds very suspicious.  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
These links are a must read for all those who get NOW into Bitcoin so they will know about this issue and who are the perpetrators:  
  
  
   
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:42:10
Nope. That "value" is not profit, it is purchase power. I do not exchange it back/"cash out" in fiat, I just use it and pay with it. If the merchant decide to charge me less in BTC, it is his problem/loss not mine.

Question: did the feds seize/stole some BTC from you? If yes, how did they do that? Force you to give up your passwords, keys to them? Because that is totally a theft at a gun point.  
If they took your phone with BTC, then you still have your passphrase and they get nothing.  
Great talk anyway. Definitely we will need a follow up of all this. Who knows maybe you man can sell the rights to make a movie?  
If you are really so fucked up by feds, set a donation address and after you recover your BTC you could give back the BTC to those who just want to bail you.

OK, but the whole idea is NOT about taxes. It is a wrong perception that by using BTC automatically you want/do avoid taxation. WRONG. You are taxed before using BTC.  
Let's say you will receive your wage in BTC, through Bitwage.com. Your employer prepare your payroll and automatically deduct the tax before paying you, to your Bitwage account. Bitwage will just receive the already taxed income, will convert into BTC and send it to your BTC wallet.  
Or if the employer already have BTC to pay you, will do the same only that will send the BTC directly to your BTC wallet, no need to send them to Bitwage. Will send you the already taxed wage. This is not tax avoidance.  
OK what other questions you have about living on BTC? I live only with BTC from 2015, in EU.

All those cards are just another banksters trick to fool people to still use fiat.  
All these cards are a propaganda for using VISA. Satoshi created Bitcoin EXACTLY to get rid of these bloodsuckers!  
**Use your damn BTC wallet instead of all these bloodsuckers intermediaries.  
A reminder to all those that didn't read [Satoshi's papers]( the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Why do you want to go back to use fiat (slave money) when you have the power in your hands (your BTC wallet)?!  
It is pathetic to see Bitcoin companies, pushing their users back to fiat/Visa!

@_date: 2017-10-06 12:43:00
NOPE!, A visa card will be a step back to fiat usage.  
Satoshi gave you a wonderful tool to get rid of fiat and banksters and yet you want to go back to fiat (slavery).  
A reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( explicitly said, the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Going back to use an intermediary is NOT the solution.

@_date: 2017-10-09 22:08:57
you don't need to do that with all now. Also is not really necessary to send btc to see how it works/test, simulate a send and see how much is requested. Simulate a wallet wipe and try recover that wallet without funds just to see if the original addresses are still there. Try a simulation to see if you can control your private key and how. This is the most important thing for a wallet not how you could send/receive btc, because for that all of them are the same.  
If I would "recommend" you a wallet that I use and is not for your needs you would say that I am an idiot or a scammer/shill. I repeat: find yourself the wallets (plural) that suit your personal needs.  
Hardware wallet/paper: for large, long time keeping funds  
Desktop wallet; for medium time/funds keeping  
Mobile wallets: small funds/short time keeping  
Online wallets; never use, or don't keep there more than 1 min your funds, intermediary storage. Is better to avoid because many could be a gov honey pot to track your btc moves.
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:07:25
I am not a "bitcoin investor", I am a Bitcoin user. Shopping from an online shop have nothing to do with Satoshi's identity. Satoshi didn't "sell" me anything, just gave us a tool to get rid of the banksters.

Yes fair enough. But instead of keeping in the cloud you better use an encrypted USB stick hidden somewhere.  
I use also steganography.  
[Example here](  
There are many apps that do that, one can be this   
Once you have a file with encrypted seed, you could post it online, keep it on your website, stored in a picture frame, in plain sight, accessible anytime, from anywhere.  
I used also a wallet seed in plain sight, in a long text, inserting the seed words in specific places that I only know. That text can be posted on your website, forum, email sent to your family, whatever online posting, from where you could recover anytime, anywhere, in plain sight, nobody will suspect that. Even in this text here, now, I could inserted 12 words seed and nobody can crack it. But only me can recover it anytime.  
Be inventive, there are many ways to hide your wallets.

A merchant that uses an intermediary for his BTC payments VIOLATES the definition of Bitcoin and with that betray the user trust itself! If they really want to use an intermediary, they have fiat/visa/mastercard for that no need for Bitcoin.  
Merchants, do not come up with the pathetic excuse of "convenience", there are many ways to accept BTC without any intermediary, there is no excuse for giving up the trust and freedom of your customers!

Another shill article:  
“The focus has been on changing this issue,” says Cole. “Projects such as OmiseGO, DASH, Stellar, BitcoinCash and Litecoin have radically improved transaction speeds.  This has eliminated some of the angst that Bitcoin has given business owners and consumers.  With new point of sale platforms emerging daily like CoinBase Commerce, cryptocurrency will be a viable payment option for businesses for the sustainable future.”  
Just think a bit about this: people that have no idea about Bitcoin, will read this article and for curiosity what they will do? Will download Bitcoin Core wallet and start transacting in a safe way?

Yes. And I strongly support you in accepting the rent in BTC.  
But... if the  tenants do not have an income in BTC, not sure if worth it. They will have to exchange from fiat to BTC and that will be an extra cost for them, in the condition that you said they are low income.  
You better help them to understand more about and find a job that pays in BTC.  
I would like to repeat for those who read  my words: do not start living on BTC if you do not have a steady income in BTC. Will never work.

3rd party custodial / online wallets are only for retards, like facebook.  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

Think again.  
Why BBVA (banksters) want to start and fund Coinbase?  
How would be easier for a gov agency to track, monitor and control BTC users? Not by making something easy for them to register and give up all their data? Convenience is not freedom. And freedom is more important than convenience. Freedom is priceless, convenience is free but you give up too much freedom.  
Coinbase "goal" is to get as much users they can to be registered, with all their data monitored. All this user data is linked to all other outside CB users data, and slowly building up a huge datamining that can monitor almost all BTC users. This is not for today or tomorrow, this is for long run.  
Govs goal is NOT to ban Bitcoin, but to find ways to get users info and let them to give up as much as they can until they are trapped.  
We have to fight against all these practices of monitoring all aspects of our lives, we give up too easy on our freedoms.  
Bitcoin was invented EXACTLY to have a big fucking tool to fight against this tyranny and yet people go back and give up their freedom.
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:19:28
Yes, there is a "negative" aspect of Bitcoin: once you start using it, you are a threat to your gov and banksters, because you re-gain your freedom and privacy (and they don't like that).  
Can you imagine how hard is to live with that burden over your head, to have your freedom and privacy in your hand? Definitely is hard to live like that.

2. Conbase - the worst place on Earth to keep your BTC. Conbase is a fucking bank!  
3. Bitstamp - is an exchange, You buy you withdraw to your wallet you control. That's it. You don't keep BTC on an exchange.  
Move your coins to a wallet that you can control 100% your keys and access. Samourai, Electrum, Bitcoin Core, Armory, Schildbach, Ledger, Trezor and many more.

As far I see you are far more than a "beginner". You have no clue about what really is Bitcoin and you want to jump into "investment" train.  
**WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!**  
First you need to understand what really is Bitcoin, as [Satoshi's papers]( explicitly said, the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Bitcoin is NOT an investment plan, Bitcoin is P2P money. If you fall into "investment" path, you will end up badly.

**Your ONLY ONE alternative is YOUR OWN fucking BTC wallet!**  
Wirex (ex e-coin, guess why they changed their name) is just another trap and is a fucking INTERMEDIARY!  
Remember this?  How many times have to be repeated for you to understand that is **the most important rule for Bitcoin**?  
Wirex is just another bank, to trick your mind, taking your BTC and give you a shit card that uses fiat.  
That is a dangerous path, like a fork, because will keep you using their "chain" of fiat not of BTC.  
The path is to get rid of all these intermediaries bloodsuckers (banskters tricks) and use your own damn BTC wallet!  
Always remember the definition of Bitcoin from [Satoshi's papers]( stated clearly: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

There is nothing wrong with Bitcoin in this case. This shows how badly some players are implementing their payment platforms with BTC.  
As I said many times here, [Satoshi's papers]( stated clearly, the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
In your case Coinbase act as another financial institution (the worst one) and you ignored the first rule of Bitcoin: do not use an intermediary when you pay with your BTC.  
Me personally when I see an online merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Coinbase page (or any other intermediary) I will cancel that payment and never use that merchant again, until they will fix their payment solution.  
People and merchants should understand the facts: we do not need any intermediary in a BTC payment transaction!

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**   
Then ask them again: why do you need another intermediary (payment processor) when your own BTC wallet is your payment processor, your bank, your money, your control.  
Why people always want to go back to the same old antiquated system of banksters slavery, to depend always of an intermediary? Satoshi gave us a beautiful tool that make us free and independent from all those shit and yet we want to go back to the shit.

I am sorry for your trouble but if I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
** Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
If you just take BTC to dump them immediately for fiat, you better just stick with fiat and not make Conbase game.  
In the last days I see a lot of "merchants" announcing their BTC acceptance through Conbase and this is quite weird, seems to be a Conbase marketing campaign or maybe the merchants are force to announce that.

You better run your own node. You could connect your SPV wallets to your node and in this way you have more security and anonymity and also help the network.  
Me personally I have 5 nodes, 3 dedicated to the network and 2 for my use.  
I really don't understand why today people are afraid to run their own node. I remember when I started with Bitcoin that were ONLY one client, the QT that was a node, miner and wallet.  
A Bitcoin node today is like a chair in Congress/Parliament, a piece of power to decide... for your own future!

It's a fucking mastercard not a Bitcoin. Bitcoin will NEVER sit/be used with a plastic card. No need for that, when you have your own BTC wallet.  
Why people (with no brains) always want to go back to fiat (slave money)?  
Satoshi gave us an amazing tool to fight the banksters, by taking from them the power of creating/controlling money and give it to us. Now dumb asses want to throw away that power and go back to use plastic cards with fiat.  
This is fucking moronic, promoting a mastercard on r/bitcoin!  
A reminder to all those that forget so easy, [Satoshi's papers]( that says: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Instead of concentrating your energy into using that fucking plastic card, better concentrate in mnaking more merchants to accept BTC directly. It's the easiest way to reach your freedom.

Electrum wallet is a great tool for businesses. Multiple accounts, multisignature, HW support, spend features, 100% control of your keys, fees control, labels, coins tracking and many more. You can even connect Electrum to your own node.

A bitcoin wallet is just an interface for your own bank.  
Bitcoin = Be your own ban, act accordingly.

In order to grow in "attention" BTC have to peg to some value. It wasn't possible to trade directly in gold for example so that's why was easiest to start be traded in USD/other fiat. That doesn't mean will stay like that forever.  
Slowly people start realizing that their fiat in a bank have less and less purchasing power or even they can lose it all, after a bailout, bailin, confiscation or whatever reason their gov will come up. But for sure they see that their money disappear.  
With BTC is not the same: you own the keys, it's yours forever, if you don't own the keys, is never yours. Simple as that. When people really understand this simple "equation" will start having BTC and use it as money.  
Just imagine how was in the old ages. A caveman start yelling at his fellows that from now on all his fish can be bought only with pink shells. At the beginning his fellows ignored him, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days but then the hunger came and they were in need. Meanwhile some 2 fellows, start looking for pink shells on the beach and store them in a hidden cave, thinking that soon they can buy all the fish from the fishermen. But they discover that instead of that they can sell those shells for more things/products and every day their pink shells gain value. Same with BTC now....

Unfortunately I see that you redirect the BTC payment to a 3rd party like Bitpay, If I would buy from your shop, I will cancel the payment and NEVER use your shop until you fix the big problem you have.  
[Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Bitcoin doesn't need any intermediary to track, monitor, control my BTC payment. That's why was invented in the first place, to get rid of all these bloodsuckers, gov and banksters puppets, 3rd party intermediaries.  
Merchants, do your job correctly, if you really want to take BTC, there are many ways to do it in the right way, without any intermediary.  
Otherwise you are just violating your customers rights and privacy.

Bitcoin will NEVER be "adopted" by any gov or country. Bitcoin is adopted by people, individuals because is a P2P currency not a centralized currency.  
Slowly govs and banksters will have a diminished role into our society. Bitcoin will bring tools to the people to self govern in a way that you can't imagine and never seen before in the whole human history.  
Don't waste your time waiting for your gov to declare Bitcoin as legal tender.

[Satoshi's papers]( say it explicitly, the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
You don't need any of other intermediaries to accept Bitcoin payments. Just accept it on your own wallet.  
That's why we say: Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank, act accordingly.

Through Bitpay... the devil of Bitcoin.  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
  
  
  
  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**

Bitcoin is a P2P decentralized currency and payment platform. There is no need for any intermediary and/or permission to use it as currency between 2 parties.  
As individual, you just need to show/give your BTC public address/QR code to the other party. Will scan your address and will just hit send, like an email. Done, in few moments you will receive your BTC.  
As a seller on web, e-commerce, you will need to setup your e-shop platform to integrate BTC payments. Again, there is no need for any intermediary, 3rd party, permission, registration to do that. Just a small software that will link your BTC wallet with your e-shop platform. Now depends on how is developed your platform, you will need or not some help from a person that understand how it works.  
What I suggest to people that have no advanced computer knowledge, and just want to start a small simple e-shop, is to use:  
- Wordpress as base platform + WooCommerce + Bitcoinway.com plugin + your own Electrum wallet. 5 min setup, no super knowledge required, no fees, no snooping, no intermediary, straight to your electrum wallet.  
- [BTCPay]( over almost any e-shop platform. A bit more time necessary to setup, no fees, open source, no snooping, no intermediary, straight to your BTC wallet.  
There are other many solutions that require a bit more help: Odoo + bitcoin module, Coingate, your own developed platform for BTC. If you search more in internet you will find them.  
What I strongly recommend: **stay away from Conbase and Bitpay** as BTC intermediaries.  
They are violating the definition of Bitcoin itself: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

Andreas is a very careful person, in his talks is attacking banksters and the status quo of existing systems, but not in a harsh way or aggressive. Only people that know to to listen him will hear what they need to hear.  
Andreas is the right person for promoting Bitcoin, he's doing a great job, no matter how.

There is no such a thing of "bitcoin debit card". Is a nonsense. Please do not use that term, is misleading. Bitcoin can't be "debited" and never will need a card in order to be used. Those carxds are just fucking VISA/fiat cards. Using those cards you are NOT helping the Bitcoin "ecosystem", you just give the fiat (and banksters) another painkiller to survive the pain.  
Each time you use fiat in any form, you give them more reason to create more debt.  
**STOP SHILLING FOR VISA/WIREX/FIAT/BANKSTERS!**  
Just because now with all this war started against companies using VISA/BTC to fool people, Wirex try to sneak into the fools minds, (but is pathetic) doesn't means Wirex is the savior of bitcoiners. Is worst! Is a fucking trap!

**it's all a farce!** to move your attention from real problems  
Independence was announced to be declared on september 2012.  
The day arrived and they said in tht date they'd "start a process" and, if they won elections thy'd declare independence next monday.  
They won, but did not declare anything. They said they will be independent after a 18 months process.  
18 months passed they said they would hold a referendum.  Ilegal, but nobody opposed.  They won it by 95% (only secessionists vote) so we expected independence next morning. But something happened and they gave us a one year deadline,.  
A year passed by but no independence, they started "the dis-connection procedure"  
- ...  
-...  years passing with a new fantasy explanation and a new deadline ... but every step sets the virtual independence closer and closer...  
-...  
- a new staged referendum,  
- a week ago Pigdemont declare independence but suspends it eight seconds after.  
- two days ago he's going to declare it, but he forgets.  
- Yesterday he was going to declare it but finally he let the decision to Parlament.  LOL What was the referendum for? They say they won it by 90%.  
- Anyway, today parlament:  
    - will vote to start a   18 months process to independence.  
or  
  - Will vote independence, but Pigdemon (or someone else) will have to declare it.  So they'll declare that, in a week, they'll have a date for an improtant declaration.   
 By November or so...  
get the pattern?  We've been laughing at this farce since 2012 here (spanish)

The REAL alternative is to use your fucking BTC wallet not a stupid VISA fiat card!  
A reminder to all those that didn't read [Satoshi's papers]( the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Don't complain that merchants around you still not accept your BTC, make them accept it!  
I live on BTC and closed all my bank accounts from 2015, but I never co complained that is hard or some fucking merchant didn't accept my BTC. I convinced many merchants around me to take my BTC, inlusing my landlord for my rent, the gas station for the gas, the grocery store for my veggies and food, beers etc. You can do it if you REALLY want to get rid of all these motherfucker banksters!  
**I am so glad that all these stupid so called "bitcoin debit cards" will be banned! Banksters are shooting themselves in their foot with this. Now finally people will start using their REAL money that are in their BTC wallets not in fucking plastic cards.**

@_date: 2017-10-30 14:09:29
Why do you think we say in Bitcoinlandia, Bitcoin = Be your own bank? So act accordingly, be a bank.  
Keeping bitcoins it's easy if you split them by categories:  
1. Small amounts (less than 1BTC) can be fine on mobile wallets, but with all safety procedures.  
2. Medium amounts (1 - 5BTC) will be OK on desktop wallets like Electrum or Core. Depends for what you use them and how often you make txs.  
3. Large amounts (5 - xxxx BTC) hardware wallets, paper, steel wallets, split the amount in pieces/types of wallets. You could even make [a picture like this]( using steganography and hide your BTC stash in plain sight.  
Me personally I use 2-3 Trezors and 2-3 Ledgers, spliting/copies of my wallets and with backups only on my personal cloud (NAS). I never store any key or info related to my wallets on public cloud storage! NEVER EVER!  
Yes, I have many NAS in different places, easily accessible  anytime, only by me. I never use any fucking public email service (gmail, hotmail, yahoo etc) for any BTC related account. All private with many aliases.

They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

Bitcoin is NOT "an investment". Bitcoin IS your future. You better say: Buying BTC today is like buying a 100% winning lottery ticket that will take place in near future.  
I always said to noobs: instead of buying stupid things, buy small amount of BTC every week/month, no matter the price it is. HODL&amp;use but never sell for fiat "profits".  
I did this from 2012 and now I have quite good amount of BTC that secure my future.

@_date: 2018-03-18 15:27:01
What you don't want to understand: Bitcoin will kick out the government. Slowly but for sure.  
A gov will never "adopt/use" BTC. Why? Because if a gov will use BTC, ALL txs will be transparent so everybody can track THEIR spend and there is no gov in this world that want that. No matter how much a gov is "transparent" for you, will never show you the real ledger.  
[Example here: 21 Trillions missing from US budget](  
So start making your own Bitcoin Parking Lot and be the first millionaire from that. Goc will never fund that and also me I will never fund a gov project because taxation is theft. But if you want I will fund a private project for that private Bitcoin parking lot.

Those you see on streets are brainwashed sheeple by the crooks that wants the power only for them (not to share it with central gov from Madrid). It's all about who will extort more money from those who are on the streets "fighting" for their so called freedom (in fact slavery).  
**IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY! Independence is just a fucking pretext**  
Follow the money and you will see **WHO** have interest in that separation.  
Let's be clear: the ultimate freedom that people can achieve is by using Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is not nationalist, communist, populist, or any other "ist". is borderless so no need for any "country" or gov to dictate what you have to do with your money.  
If we are free to trade (aka using BTC) we don't need any "regulation", law by any central gov to be imposed. So all this BS with separation and independence is just like throwing a bone to a dog (catalan sheeple) meanwhile you (the catalan gov) are eating the good meat.

I am with Bitcoin from 2012 but never "lost" trust in Bitcoin. You can't because there is no trust, just verify. Once you really understand what IS Bitcoin you can't "untrust" it. Those how leave Bitcoin community or just sell their BTC because "they lost trust in BTC" are just losers that will never understand what really is Bitcoin.

In 2014 I was interviewed by some companies and I always asked in the interview if they can pay me in BTC. Some were reticent, some interested in the idea, but only one was already willing to do that, but doesn't know how to do it. So I refused all other job offers (some even much better paying) for the one that accepted to pay me in BTC. Their condition was to teach them more about Bitcoin (the directors, accountants and staff).  
Today they are paying almost 80% of their employees in BTC, because of my request.

Any merchant that take BTC should never sell those BTC. Use them to pay others.  
You charge in USD/EUR but take as payment BTC. You don't need to tell to your taxman that you took BTC. You register your sale as it is in USD, not in BTC.  
You pay taxes for your sales in USD, BTC have nothing to do with your taxes.  
But if you are dumb enough to put those BTC into an exchange where is linked to your name, be sure your taxman will come after you.

No is NOT. There are many many other ways to use BTC without Conbase. The fact that many people are using Conbase, is because is the only one company sill like hell everywhere, people are dumb and do not read more before using a service. Conbase is used more because of the "sheeple effect".  
Conbase is a "product" tool of banksters, pushed to be used at maximum, because they want to track, monitor, register any BTC user.

I am not talking about 2 million stores accepting BTC. Square is the problem and is a bad actor for BTC.
Bitcoin was created exactly to get rid of all these intermediaries, trackers, govs and give freedom to individuals. yet the banksters system fought back and "introduce" these "nice" intermediaries like Square, to make you happy that you pay with BTC, but in fact they just make you to continue to stay in a fiat world. The merchant even don't know that can have those BTC, because are dumped immediately in exchange for fiat. So they are back into the hamster wheel...  
Until we will not get rid totally of these diseased fiat system and people start using/controlling THEIR OWN money we will not have a better world.

I would like to have a wallet that connects better with merchants.  
- wallet user want to spend some BTC in the area, open the wallet and look into the local merchants near by  
- wallet is displaying those merchants that accept BTC in near area of the user location  
- wallet also will display merchants offers of the day for paying in BTC (discounts, parties, 0 day offers etc)  
- user that click &amp; accept the displayed offer will pay with that wallet to the merchant to get the discount  
- this partnership between wallet provider, merchant and user can be extended to paid advertising services where the parties split the ad revenue. Merchant pay the ad to the wallet provider, the wallet sell to the user the ad, user get a discount from the wallet provider/merchant because he accept that ad offer. This is just an example, can be many ways to interact.  
Important thing is that people with wallets have to have an easy way to spend btc with good offers. This creates adoption for users and merchants.

[Here, the best answer](
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:26:51
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

What you need is another intermediary that converts 2 fiat currencies, not fiat-&gt;BTC-&gt;fiat. See Abra, I think that one is doing remitances conversion.  
Bisq is to buy/sell BTC with local currencies.  
What you want to do is way more complicated and you will be stuck in KYC/AML laws or you will have to find another "ways" to do it. Reddit is NOT the pace to ask for that.

No it don't need to be like that. They can simply hodl those BTC or just pay their employees with BTC. Otherwise why they take BTC in the first place? They still have  visa and fiat money for that.  
All those merchants that take BTC just to immediate dump for fiat I name them morons and they do not do any good to Bitcoin but at reverse.  
Any merchant that is not putting back into circulation those BTC (by paying employees or suppliers) is simply an idiot that doesn't care about his future. By simply going back to fiat is putting himself in a huge debt...   
 I live only with using BTC from 2015 and I do not care about price fluctuation.

You can even split your income: % in fiat straight to your regular bank acc and another % in BTC straight to your BTC wallet. No need more hassle buying on exchanges.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:18:05
Yes, your BTC wallet is your POS. You can use a watch only wallet, for not allowing your employees to spend those BTC, put the amount of fiat into request payment, your wallet will create a QR code and when the customer will scan that code will have the amount of BTC already, just push the payment into the blockchain and done.  
This takes just few seconds. No need for developing/adapting/changing anything in your actual system. Is like taking cash but in a digital form.  
Check Sentinel wallet from Samourai. You could have for you, as the owner/manager of the shop your Samourai wallet and using the xpub address from that wallet, imported into Sentinel (watch only) wallet for your employees.

Sorry but Indians are quite dumb. First they give up all their human rights by accepting that biometric ID, now they accept this supposedly ban on buying BTC through exchanges. What's next? Accepting lobotomy because your gov say so?  
The point is to only BUY BTC, not trading it. Buy BTC and start using it as money. If your gov doesn't let you doing that, overthrow it, they are there to represent YOU not only against you.  
[Remember these words?](  
Also Bisq is using a escrow system. You can't be scammed until you have the BTC/fiat in your bank/wallet, because the arbitrator is holding the 3rd key to release the money. As I said, read the fucking FAQs.

Not being dependent of a bank or central authority that manage my money, gives me total freedom of decision about my money and how do I spend them.  
I am not in fear anymore that I will lose my money or somebody will seize them.  
I can travel wherever I want with all my money I want, without anybody noticing I carry in my mind all my money.  
I do not have any worries about how/where I would spend my money, nobody can trace me how I spend my money and nobody can judge me about where/why/how I spend my money.  
I do not have anymore the feeling that somebody is monitoring all my spends and sell me later stupid products based on my shopping habits. Because they are not able anymore to track me.  
Gov if want me to pay taxes, would have to prove me first how much I have earned (if they can) and they are not able anymore to rob my money.

Good, but also they can't stop people transact P2P by using  a P2P [decentralized]( exchange until everybody will have enough BTC to use it as money and dump the worthless goat shit fiat.

Are all these "tutorials" and learning videos about Bitcoin, ever verified that says the correct info?  
I just found 3 errors in the first video. Will make a review later, but this has to be reviewed by more people.  
**Teaching bad with errors is not teaching at all..**  
EDIT:  
min 00:24 - wallet generates a new address each time you use it, to send or receive BTC
Wrong: the wallet generates a new address only when you receive and only when you specifically setup to do it.  
min 1:49 - BTC wallet balance - there is no such thing in Bitcoin network.  
min 2:06 - miners, the first to "crack" the cryptographic puzzles. Geeze such a BS. Miners solve mathematical hash not crack heads...  
min 2:18 - miners once they crack the puzzle they can claim any fee tx included in that block. WTF I just heard!?  
Oh man... I couldn't continue like that, these videos are full BS crap lies.

Is not about being cheaper, is more re-gain your financial privacy. You never thought about "how much can cost your financial privacy" ?  
BTW... there is no such thing of "bitcoin debit card". Those cards are VISA/fiat cards and have nothing to do with Bitcoin. Using those cards you just give up your financial privacy (again) by going back using fiat.  
Use your BTC wallet not a VISA/fiat card!  
Maybe r/LivingOnBitcoin can give you more information.

Why is necessary to convert BTC to USD? If you get BTC, stay with BTC, use them to pay your employees or providers. if not, just stay with fiat and VISA.  
I really do not understand why this stupidity of converting the precious BTC hardly obtained from customers that want to pay with BTC, into worthless fiat money.

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

Totally wrong question. You are NOT investing in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a company, society, group, hedge fund or something like that.  
You can say "invest in my future by buying now BTC".  
"Investing in Bitcoin" means speculation on steroids and is wrong. But coming from Trastra (a crypto bank) is understandable that they only want profits from their users, posting shills for their services here.  
This is not educating people into Bitcoin, this is giving them false expectations and making them losing more money.  
So Trastra... you have my downvote for trying to manipulate people here...
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:48:20
Bitcoin will not be the ONLY one currency used. There will be many more, but the important thing it will be that ALL of them you will buy them only with BTC.  
That's why is better to have now some BTC to HODL so you will be able to buy later some other coins.

Rule  have HODL previously lots of BTC  
Rule  earn/be paid in BTC  
Rule  start praising BTC around you, in your local area, until at least 50% of people start using it  
Rule  help others to understand/use BTC, that makes you more determined to use it too (you can't teach others if you do not use it or know almost all details about it)

The important thing that people always ignore is that Bitcoin will be only 21 millions EVER. Now put that sum next to 8 billions people on this planet. Do you really think will be enough BTC for all? Of course we will go for using satoshis as main unit. This was also Satoshi's vision. Why he should name this unit as his name afterwards? This is the trick.

- lost track of [Irak war billions](  
- lost track another [trillions on 9/11](  
- [all taxes goes to military complex]( - how many roads, hospitals, schools etc can be built with these trillions?    
- pay taxes to [fund these military police that kill civilians instead of protecting them](  
[- pay taxes so the gov can tax me rain water and ponds on my property?](  
- pay taxes to build railroads [that later GM dismantle them to push their agenda of heavy use of cars](

I tested too. I encourage many people to do it. Yes it is in beta phase, but for testing with small amounts is OK. Actually this is LN, using small amounts of BTC, if you want to make big payments, use the BTC blockchain, is still cheap.  
The experience is great.  
Here are some additional resources to find and connect to a LN node:  
  
  
  
Also you can test with Bitrefill

Answer to your Q: [this](
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:08:30
NONE.  
Use your damn BTC wallet and NOT a so called bitcoin debit card. Al those cards are joke, a pathetic intent of banksters to suck more blood from bitcoiners, pushing them back to use the fucking fiat.  
Don't be afraid of using your own BTC wallet! There are many places where to use your BTC directly.  
Those are NOT Bitcoin cards, ARE VISA/fiat cards!  
**Bitcoin doesn't need any intermediary to be spent. Going back to fiat (aka those cards) is NOT an option!**  
I am sick of all these bloodsuckers that just want to keep people using fiat and [putting a horse in front of a car](  
This is again another banksters trick to fool people NOT to use their P2P money, but giving away their freedom of using their own Bitcoin wallet!  
People should always remember the 1st line of [Satoshi's papers](  
**"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."**   
These cards are just pushing you back to those "financial institutions" that Satoshi wanted to get rid of them!  
Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now (stupid) people want to give back that power to the banksters... what a shame!  
**Use your own damn BTC wallet!**

I did your survey.  
When I saw that is on Google servers, I switched to a TOR network.  
Observations: Cybercrime is not equal Cryptocurrency. That makes me think this survey is run not by a student but by a "journalist" that have no idea about what is Bitcoin and crypto. Or maybe even worse, a cover gov. agent.  
Please, don't do anymore some of these stupid "surveys", will be worthless anyway.

Wrong. You are already registered and tracked.  
Use a decentralized exchange that doesn't force you do that, shapeshift your bought coins and be sure you never leave traces.  
Or just live only using BTC. Be paid in BTC and spend only in BTC.

If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**

Cool, now everybody will move to P2P decentralized exchanges... and soon will start using only BTC. The whole fiat world will collapse in few years.  
I wonder how the "smart" polish gov will identify each BTC tx on the blockchain that is related with a polish citizen to be taxed... LOL this is hilarious. First they will create a parliamentary committee to analyze it it and create a legislative framework. That will take between 6 mo and 3 years. Meanwhile BTC is growing fast. Once that framework is done, they will need to implement and create a law enforcement division able to deal with that. another 1 year. Until then BTC is already fully anonymous and fiat world is collapsed. In 3 years from now, we will not have anymore politicians, they will be replaced with DAOs.

[The important question that people do not ask](  
People are concentrated too much in what gov will do against them, but they are not concentrated at all in what they are doing against their gov.  
Govs are there, because you people put them in place. Is time for you to take them out. Not by force. No need for that.  
The Silent Revolution is here.  
Just dump the fiat, empty and close your bank accounts, buy BTC and use only BTC as money. Only like that you can crush the banksters (the real masters of the govs).  
If only 5% of population of each country will do this, they can't keep up with bank runs. They are not prepared for this.  
I know I will get a trigger against me by the gov agents, for this post. I don't care, they can't do anything against me. Ban me if you want but there will be more to say it loud and clear here: **YOUR END IS NEAR!**

I suggest to use Mycelium to buy from a local trader option not through the bank cards option. Is much easier, and no ID needed. Find a local trader close to your location through Mycelium directory and contact directly.  
If you just want to test BTC with your father this is the best way.  
If you want to go further, I suggest to use a real exchange.  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](    
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

Bitcoin is not “unregulated”. It is regulated by algorithm instead of being regulated by government bureaucracies. Un-corrupted.  
Bitcoin allows the free market of ideas being flooded with innovation without the need to ask for permission.  
Bitcoin doesn't need a law to be "legal". **Bitcoin is the new law** of mathematics that will make govs and banks illegal/useless.  
Bitcoin will survive the banking regulators and oppressive governments. The converse however is unlikely.  
Most people are yet to understand how disruptive the Bitcoin technology really is.  
Bitcoin’s success is owed to creativity and innovation. It has nothing to do with the government’s endorsement.  
Bitcoin is regulated by math. Banks are regulated by committees that are either completely powerless or entirely "captured" by those they regulate.  
Bitcoin doesn’t just disrupt money. It also disrupts the models of modern corporations, macro-economics, nation-states and the Internet.

So, follow Andreas example and I created a nice paper wallet, embedded into a nice picture wallpaper that stays out in the open into my living room. Absolutely nobody knows that the picture have inside the passphrase for 10BTC (or maybe more later).  
That picture can be enywhere in this world, out in the open - on your website, on your instagram, on any other cloud or storage NAS, on an USB stick, on a picture frame in your office etc. And nobody have a damn clue about what contain (not even your wife).

**Use your damn BTC wallet and nobody will touch your money!**  
Resistance is not futile. Yes is hard these days with all these fees, delays, blocks etc but that doesn't mean we have to surrender in front of all banksters tricks.  
If you have BTC, spend them directly with a merchant that accept BTC directly.  
If you have fiat, spend it in cash as much is it possible. Do not go back from BTC to fiat, that is the most dangerous thing and you fall back to their trap.  
**FUCK THE BANKS!**

I wonder how you get to have BTC in the first place. Because from your post there are only 2 conclusions:  
- you never read anything about Bitcoin and still you don't have any willing to do that (bad for you)  
- you are a desperate gov agent trying to obtain more information for free on reddit.

Your own BTC wallet (hardware or steel or steganography) is your pension fund that nobody will touch it.  
Buy now BTC, keep it safe and wait the days of your retirement. Buy every week/month a steady amount, no matter the price it is and never sell. You will have plenty for your retirement.

Instead of buying with CC, you better look into buying from an ATM. Can be cheaper, safer and more private for that % you pay over the market price from a regular exchange.  
Make your own calculations, study the price market, see the exchanges how they operate and then choose the one way is better for you.  
Today we have plenty of exchanges out there and ways to buy BTC. Just few years ago there were only 2-3 exchanges.  
  
  
  
  
  
 - ATM list  
   
My personal advice: don't ask on reddit "best place to ..." or "best wallet..." or "best exchange..." Reddit is full of shills and "bots" paid to promote things.  
I gave you those links just to be able to make your own decision and choose by yourself. Do not believe me, verify what am I saying and be well informed.  
Bitcoinlandia is JUNGLE! Watch out where you walk through.
@_date: 2017-05-13 07:48:04
Find another way to buy BTC, there are tons of other ways out there.  
Every day that you continue to use CB is increasing the possibility that you will lose your money.  
Cloinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters (BBVA) and always will act like a bank!  
Here are some other places where you can start buying BTC with no fear/frustration:  
 - P2P decentralized exchange, **strongly recommended**

But you put a link to a list of exchanges where to buy BTC and not even a link to coinmap.org where they can see that there are many places where to spend. No wonder noobs coming here and ask so many times where to spend and what they get are just "advice" for gambling trading and move the discussion from what really is BTC.  


No problem, users can do that. I didn't say that you or mods personally have to stay and gather that info. Let the participants adding items and you just have to approve or check the consistency.  
We want adoption of BTC not extensive day trading and speculation in the end. Adoption can be achieved with education and access to the right information. If r/Bitcoin will not provide it, then who?  
As I mentioned in other post, [why this sticky post was taken down from r/Bitcoin?]( - it has all info a noob will need and yet is hard to find it. THIS should be posted on the right panel links.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:07:27
almost 50% of noobs leave the scene in the first contact and come back later (sometimes when is too late). Some of them learned the lesson, some are equal dumb.  
Very few noobs you can consider them interested into learning more in using BTC. The majority are just idiots hunting to be "day traders" and buy a stupid lambo.  
We really don't need mass adoption by idiots. Bitcoin is in the incipient phase, still need a lot of tools to be a real form of money and more important is that people get educated. All these "day traders" have only shit in their brain.

Nothing. Bitcoin will continue to be used and even more.  
Gov can ban ONLY something they can control it (aka exchanges, bank accounts). But there are many ways to obtain BTC and use it without gov can do something.  
Gov will not ban Bitcoin because they are afraid of what will happen: capital flows to other countries where BTC will not be banned.  
Also the narrative that "Bitcoin is used for terrorism and money laundering" is not going to stay too long, people are waking up and realize that is just BS. So they will start asking: What the fuck is wrong with my gov?

Bitcoin will cease to exist if we start acting like banksters today. Bitcoin is based on the feature that no one can stop a transaction if that tx is correctly broadcast.  Bitcoin was created exactly to avoid that.  
Is not quite strange coincidence that NSA created tools like those ransomware, release them to the public, so the public will "demand" that the addresses should be tracked and seized?  
Is not this sounds to you like the well known scenario, problem - reaction - solution?

Evenb if a bank will "share" with you the private keys of an account, the question then is why the fuck I should share it with the bankster when I can be my own bank.  
I see few people that understand the meaning of this:  
**Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank = Act Accordingly**  
Also people should understand another fact: Bitcoin is NOT here to **adapt** to existing systems, Bitcoin is here **to change the existing systems** forever and irreversible. People and systems **have to adapt to Bitcoin system!**  
That's why banksters shit their pants right now, because they know that Bitcoin is the asteroid over their head.

Let's be clear:  
Bitcoin = FREEDOM  
Fiat = Slavery  
Selling your BTC is like selling your Freedom.  
I started in 2012 by playing BTC faucets, buying BTC from miners/exchanges, mining myself, at whatever price it was, everytime I had some spare cash, I bought and HODL.  
**BUT NEVER SELL MY FREEDOM!**  
Sometimes I used BTC to buy stuff, then buy back + 10% more.  
**BUT NEVER SELL MY FREEDOM!**    
From 2015 I start being paid for my work in BTC...  
**BUT NEVER SELL MY FREEDOM!**  
So from then, I closed my bank accounts (slavery tools) and live free ONLY with BTC.

Break the slavery VISA chains and don't be afraid of using your own BTC wallet! There are many places where to use your BTC directly.  
Those are NOT Bitcoin cards, ARE VISA/fiat cards!  
**Bitcoin doesn't need any intermediary to be spent. Going back to fiat is NOT an option!**  
I am sick of all these bloodsuckers that just want to keep people using fiat and [putting a horse in front of a car](  
This is again another banksters trick to fool people NOT to use their P2P money, but giving away their freedom of using their own Bitcoin wallet!  
People should always remember the 1st line of [Satoshi's papers](  
**"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."**   
These cards are just pushing you back to those "financial institutions" that Satoshi wanted to get rid of them!  
Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now (stupid) people want to give back that power to the banksters... what a shame!

You are one of those that when somebody warned here about CB you said "I am fine for me always working, CB is a great exchange". After years of using CB and you still never been at least curious if other exchanges exist in this world? You never clicked even on that simple link from the right panel of this sub where it says "how to buy bitcoins worldwide"?  
I hope that many others will learn the lesson from you and those who are on the endless list of Coinbase "victims", that ignorance will make you pay a high price.  
Here are tons of other places from where you can obtain BTC:  
  
  
  
  
   
To remember you the warning: Coinbase is bank, funded and created by the banksters (BBVA) and [will always act like a bank]( to track users money, to seized users money, to close users accounts, [to give away users data to Negan]( to store and incriminate all your BTC traffic, to put you in a most infamous list of BTC users (for later use) and so on.

In Windoze:  
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Electrum\wallets you will find a file named default_wallet.  
I suggest to just rename that file (always is good to have a backup) and when you open electrum will create a new one and will ask you where to save it. You can keep the wallet file anywhere you want and anytime you open Electrum, will open the last opened file. You can have as many you have wallet files, but be sure you name them as you know them.  
Warning! **Always backup your passphrase when you create a wallet!** That is your only way to recover your wallet. **You have been warned!**  
Read carefully all the FAQs from electrum.org page, they have very good documentation and help.  
I used to carry with me an encrypted USB drive containing: latest Electrum executable (stand alone) and vary wallet files (encrypted also). I can use anywhere that USB by carrying also a bootable USB with Tails.  
Of course the USB drive is just a copy, backed up in many other places.  
The passphrase used to create an Electrum desktop wallet can be used also to open it on your mobile Electrum.

There is no way to link every BTC address to a real person. So? You will never have the real number of BTC users. Maybe you will have a number of addresses with some coin in them, but nothing more.

Don't take me wrong. Your intentions are good and welcomed. But the "reviewers" intentions are not good to be trusted.  
If you really want to educate and inform people about services and companies, just make a detailed, real, specific listing of all features and/or making a comparison of pro/contra aspects between similar services/companies.  
Letting others to "review" is more than suspicious and not trusted and can damage your initial good plan to just inform people.

"Market cap" is a TOTAL NONSENSE!  
You can't compare limited supply of money with unlimited supply of money.  
At least we can do it comparing with gold but even then is something that is meaningless.  
Those who think that they will sell their btc for fiat because today is 1700 or 10k fiat they are fooling themselves. Because from the moment they bought BTC with less fiat until they sold the BTC for more fiat, that fiat value was decreased/devalued in the time they wait until sell, so they will buy less things with those "more money"...  
Let me put it in a simple way:  
- you have an apple tree in your garden that every year will make 100 apples that you sell me for 100$ (1$/each apple).  
-but next year I get a new printing machine that will make for me easy money whenever I want. So I will start printing when your tree is making apples.  
- you don't know that but for me the cost of printing is getting less and less every year and for your is harder and harder to have 100 apples  
-your supply is ALWAYS 100 apples no matter you want. My money supply is INFINITE anytime I want...  
So... do you think you will be richer if I pay you next year 200$ instead of 100$ for your 100 apples? NO WAY, the papers that I gave you are every year less valuable (worthless).  
Exactly the same happen with BTC now.  
But... one day you will say: "no more your worthless papers, from now on the currency will be my apples" and people will start making trades with your "apples".  
Guess what will happen? Your apples, being limited will became every year more valuable, because the supply is limited.  
Happy HODLing :) and ignore all those BS crap post about "marketcap is about 1 trillion of billions of worthless goat shit fiat papers!!!" Are just pumpers... When you hear them screaming, remember how was in Zimbabwe the "marketcap"....

Where I live almost every merchant accept it. No need to go back to fiat. I closed all my bank accounts long time ago in 2015. And is not USNazi... is EU.  
US mentality is too pegged to plastic cards and $$, people can't imagine that it is possible in 2018 to live only using BTC. EU mentality is different.  
r/LivingOnBitcoin is real even if US people do not believe it.  
There are other people in EU that live only with BTC (as far I know more 3 persons close to me) but I get info that every day are more. Many will not say it loud as me, they just live. Not everything happen is happening on r/Bitcoin. Many merchants that do not promote their BTC acceptance but still accepted for those who knows.

Another desperate banskters shill for those shit cards.  
Those are NOT Bitcoinb cards, ARE VISA/fiat cards!  
**Bitcoin doesn't need any intermediary to be spent. Going back to fiat is NOT an option!**  
I am sick of all these bloodsuckers that just want to keep people using fiat and [putting a horse in front of a car](  
This is again another banksters trick to fool people NOT to use their P2P money, but giving away their freedom of using their own Bitcoin wallet!  
People should always remember the 1st line of [Satoshi's papers](  
**"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."**   
These cards are just pushing you back to those "financial institutions" that Satoshi wanted to get rid of them!  
Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now (stupid) people want to give back that power to the banksters... what a shame!  
**Use your own damn BTC wallet!**  
Bitpay should focus on how to make/help merchants to accept BTC not to keep them using the fucking plastic cards. With this, Bitpay again demonastrate that is NOT a Bitcoin company but a fiat/banksters company.

Coinbase was funded and created by the banksters (BBVA). What do you expect from banksters? To make your life easier? No way, CB was created for a reason and that is NOT to help BTC users but to track them, seize their money, [give up their info to "3rd parties"]( close your account when you need most, having platform "glitches" exactly when is supposed to work normally, save &amp; store all info about anyone that enter in contact with their platform.  
If I see a merchant that redirect the payment to a CB page I instant cancel that tx and forget about that merchant.  
This happen by design not by coincidence

Try bitsquare.io or BTC ATM or localbitcoins.com  
Then shapeshift your BTC to altcoins and back to new BTC address, spreading the amounts.  
There will be no way to trace back to you in this way.

Nope. If a polish citizen buy BTC in a P2P decentralized exchange like Bisq, that tx will be only between 2 citizens. Gov will have zero knowledge about.  
Polish shops operates in zlots not in BTC. If a customer pays in BTC, the shop is charging in zlots and pay taxes in zlots.  
What you/polish gov are trying say is that if you pay using Paypal also you could be taxed 1% more for that tx. That is a total stupidity.  
Anyway this scenario will never work. Let them break their necks into bureaucracy first.  
For example: I am a freelancer and I bill my clients in EUR, but I take payments in BTC. No ones more than me and the payer have that info. No bank, no gov, no taxman. I register for taxes my invoice, I pay the VAT and taxes regarding, in EUR, but my money are in BTC. There is no way that a gov will be able to tax (again) my invoice with an extra tax of 1% for the BTC tx. First of all they will have no info on that.

No one from outside Venezuela can tell you their "opinion" about Venezuela situation because will be a total BS crap. We don't know exactly what they live inside that country.  
As we see it from outside is a total other story. What we see is that the majority  of population are so deep in stagnation that they are not capable to dethrone that imbecile that name himself president. People are complacing in this situation of being fully subsidized by the state instead of being free. A normal person will up rise against the regime and put in place a democratic gov.  
But I think there are many influences from outside that are trying to keep this state of chaos in Venezuela, because is in their own interest that Venezuela will not be a real power in the region.   
We saw many communist countries from Eastern Europe that changed their regime and we all know that all of them without any "help" from outside will not do that move. The state of fear against population is a good weapon.  
That's why Venezuela is kept in this state, to be like a boogieman.  
Venezuelans should wake up and with own internal forces to change the regime. Yes, Bitcoin could be a real good weapon for them but that needs education and that is hard to achieve for people in a permanent fear.

If that will happen (track/block their addresses), Bitcoin will cease to exist. Bitcoin is based on the feature that no one can stop a transaction if that tx is correctly broadcast.  
What you are asking is exactly what banks are doing today. Bitcoin was created exactly to avoid that.  
Is not quite strange coincidence that NSA created tools like those ransomware, release them to the public, so the public will "demand" like you, that the addresses should be tracked and seized?  
Is not this sounds to you like the well known scenario, problem - reaction - solution?  
Is not NSA/gov those who want to see Bitcoin tracked or dead?

[Satoshi's papers]( first line state:  
**"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."**  
A blacklisted coin will contradict that first line, that means we don't have anymore Bitcoin in place. Would be another altcoin/shitcoin/fedcoin.

Many people take Bitcoin in the wrong way. We don't have to adapt Bitcoin to existing systems, laws, taxes, mentality, way of using money etc.  
**Bitcoin is here to change all of those, Bitcoin is here to change the world as we know it!**  
We, the people and the systems we have to adapt to Bitcoin "way" not the way around.  
Forced taxation (theft) will no longer be as we know it in Bitcoinlandia.  
**I will never give away my bitcoins to be used for wars, corruption, useless politicians, useless spends etc** And what is more important: govs and taxmans, they will never have a way to take my bitcoins. **NEVER EVER!**

Your BTC will always sit nicely into the blockchain.  
Most of the online wallets doesn't respect [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so it's up to you if you want to give free your BTC to a 3rd party holder. All those backups, encryption that attract you are just BS lies.  
**Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank = Act Accordingly**  
Online wallets = Bitcoin Bank  
A bank will never stop being a bank (aka the ones that rob you). That's why Bitcoin was invented, to get rid of all these thefts.  
If you read [the Satoshi's papers]( the first line is explaining the very first thing why Bitcoin: *"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."* This is NOT a coincidence, it is a FEATURE!

I convince my mom to start buying BTC in 2014 after long discussions. She was 20 years a director for a small bank in a small town. Not a bankster :) in the real sense, just a worker in a bank, but with lot of "inside" information and a bit of brainwash from top positions and "training".  
So in 2014 she start buying small amounts of BTC.  
Today she convert all her pension into BTC. Nothing stays in a bank! A banker that is no longer keep money in a bank!  
Do you know what was the key point to decide to get into BTC? Her granddaughter.  
I said: OK you don't want BTC for you, for your retirement. But at least do you want that your granddaughter have a great future ? Because she was always giving her some money and support her in all.  
Then I said: Buy some BTC at least and put them into your granddaughter's wallet and forget about them. do this for her future.  
Next month she start buying small amounts, all for her granddaughter. Today she use bitwage to receive all her pension in BTC. No more fiat! And some amounts of BTC goes to my daughter's wallet too.  
Now my mom understands the power of TRUE MONEY, after she worked 20 years with fake money, now she feel what is to really have ownership of your money! and most important thing is that she know that this is for her granddaughter future....  
**THIS IS BITCOIN!**  
My advice to all bitcoiners that want their moms into this: try to find a way that first they understand "why", "how" and "what for", find "their need" for Bitcoin, that each person have it in some way. Never go for the "investment" road... that will never work. Bitcoin is NOT an investment. Bitcoin is more like buying today a "certified winner ticket" for a lottery in the near future. Each BTC is a winner against the banksters and fiat.

Are you fucking nuts?! Bitcoin acceptance IS NOT ONLY about the fucking Coinbase! BTW Coinbase is a bank, funded and created by the banksters (BBVA) and will always act like a bank. Do you still trust a bank?  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid these types of bloodsuckers and intermediaries. The Satoshi's papers started by this: **"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."**  
Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank = Act Accordingly.  
Accepting BTC on a website takes between 1-5 min to set, with NO intermediary.  
FYI If I would have to buy something online with BTC and I am redirected to a Coinbase payment page **I WILL NEVER DO THAT PAYMENT and never buy from that merchant again!** I will not let a bank to interfere into my financial details.

Is really stupid to think that you are a "millionaire" in fiat money because you will sell your BTC for that.  
[For more the BTC price will go high for more fiat will be worthless goat shit](  
Let's be clear: who is HODLing now BTC is not even thinking to sell for any price. Because there will come the day when fiat will cease to exist. Will obsolete like faxes today.  
Just think that what you buy today with 1 BTC you will buy in 5 years with 100k satoshis.

Yep, pay your taxes and even declare everything that your taxman have no idea about. Why not? Your gov needs more money to fund wars and terrorism and take more rights of you... Fund your own slavery!  
Please move your questions about paying taxes to your taxman, Here is r/Bitcoin not r/tax!  
Stop this disguised propaganda for paying taxes!  
Bitcoin is not here to adapt to existing laws, systems, taxation etc, but to change dramatically all of those! Systems, laws and most important, people have to adapt to Bitcoin system.  
The govs still have no idea what is Bitcoin and until they will have 1% idea, people minds already changed, shifted to Bitcoin system and they will no longer accept the old, antiquated, slavery systems run by the banksters.  
Humanity, in order to thrive, first will need to get rid of all wars and gov agencies that create "terrorists". How? Stop paying taxes, boycott them.  
Society can live without wars and Bitcoin is here to help doing that.  
You can't have endless wars with Bitcoin, because nobody will give his BTC to fund wars.  
Just a latest example of what gov is doing with your money from those lovely taxes: [give $100 billions to Saudis in a new arms deal](  
**$100 billions!, are 5 times more than the total value in $ of all bitcoins in circulation!**

The goods and services that you buy with that medium of exchange have value.  
Bitcoin is MONEY, [as it was mentioned by Satoshi Nakamoto in his papers](  
**Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
That's IT! Nothing else.  
The fact that people are hoarding BTC is that not because they are "investing", is because fiat is no longer a good medium of exchange.  
The value of BTC never rise, but the "value" of fiat is going down. Why? Because fiat is NOT money as BTC. Is just a fucking worthless IOU.

In 2015 I did like a "treasure hunt" for kids. My daughter and 2 of her friends had to find a treasure in form of a BTC wallet.  
So I create a new wallet with 1 BTC and split it in 3 different addresses inside. One for each.  
So I hide/carved/wrote 12 words of the wallet seed in 12 different places around the place where we live. Trees, bridges, stones, postal boxes, etc.  
They have to find each of those 12 clues/words and in each place I gave them a clue about the order of that word in the whole passphrase. At kids level not so hard.  
Once they find the 12 words they had to create the passphrase and try it into an Electrum wallet to recover it. Then they had to split/send from each of those 3 addresses the amount to their personal wallet.  
Took them 3 days of playing around for "treasure hunt". Fun and educative and profitable too!

People easily forget history and nowadays these kind of history is omitted in schools.  
[People are brainwashed to forget what really is gold and its value and now they prefer to choose a candy bar instead of a gold bar](   
Extrapolate that to Bitcoin...  
I usually see this world like a greenish bottle, full of ants, just walking around inside the bottle with no sense whatsoever.  
The "government" is some kind of big human outside of that bottle that is poring water inside the bottle and use technology to screen on that bottle walls, the TV media, full of "news" that just keep busy the ants inside the bottle, to work and pay taxes.  
So this happen with every country, each one with his big/small bottle and color of the bottle.  
But in 2008-2009 something strange happen.  
Some ants, with a bit more strange curiosity and willing to see what really is on the other side of the bottle glass, they tried a way to "escape" from the bottle and finally they get out.  
The Pandora's Box just opened and in front of their eyes was rolling over a new world, with plants, dirt, rocks, more food etc but also something else. **FREEDOM**.  
Until then they didn't know the meaning of that word and some of them not even know that the word "freedom" exist.  
So, one of these ant guys, name the way of escape from the bottle, Bitcoin. and spread the word about it to other ants.  
Then guess what happen, many others ants go back inside the bottle and throw down a rope to the other fellows inside. And some other ant guy name that rope, **exchanges**. So quickly many other ants find that rope and take it. In the beginning with curiosity or ignorance or hope or enthusiasm... So after few years many ants start seeing the REAL WORLD outside the bottle. Some of the ants just want a sneak peak and go back to the bottle, the TRUTH was **too dangerous** for them and they get scared... They go back to their old work and pay taxes, watching fake TV on the bottle glass, but with a strange feeling and question: what if the world outside the bottle is the real world? So why am I still here?  
But years after years the number of those who decide to go full outside the bottle and never go back is bigger and bigger.  
So now the government saw that escape rope going out of the bottle and they always try to cut it, to put more sticky things on it or burn it, sometimes putting a cork. But you know what? Now many ants inside the bottle already know about the existence of that rope and they start pushing the gov not to cut that rope, they try to control the access to those who are allowed or not to use the rope.  
But what govs do not see yet, is that at the bottom of the bottle, where their eyes can't see very clearly, there is a revolution starting, a silenced not aggressive revolution. And that revolution is that some other ants will start digging a hole under the bottle and will bring down the whole bottle once and for all.  
Is just about time until all the ants will see the REAL FREEDOM of Bitcoin!  
Thank you for you time to read this.

I start doing this in 2013-2014 and now I have a steady number of clients that pays me in BTC for my informing "services". People that doesn't have time or patience to catch up with all news and stuff about Bitcoin. They are good people, with money, that buys, HODL and use BTC.  
They pay me every time BTC goes up and if it goes down they pay nothing. That was the deal. They stay informed, I stay informed and educate myself, I am paid in BTC for that. Everybody wins.

@_date: 2017-05-15 22:30:49
Nope. This is not even a fart... Anything that you see linked with a bank means: [your money will not be your money anymore...](  
That's why we say: Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank = Act accordingly  
They said: “We recognize cryptocurrency as an investment class similar to other securities,”  
That means: we will sell you a paper (aka another IOU) that says you invest xx amount of BTC in some kind of shit "investment" or even "bitcoin shares".  
This is another trick of banksters to fool people to give away their money.  
[When people will really listen and learn the lesson of what Andreas is repeating over and over for years?!](  
Banks knows that they can't control Bitcoin, but they know they can control the stupid users. Once you give them your BTC, you will be tracked, seized, controlled.  
Exactly what happen with Coinbase, that was just a test, funded and created by the BBVA banksters. They fooled people to get easy into buy/sell BTC, use a wallet etc. But the real reason was just testing the tracking of usage of BTC... Make a step back and see the BIG PICTURE, don't be a sheeple...  
If you respect the Golden Rule of Bitcoin you will never be "controlled" by them. And they know it. That's why I will be downvoted like hell for this. I don't care. I will continue to warn people. Use your damn private wallet, not a custodial wallet!

You really want me to post here a 2 pages list of all CB users that get caught in the middle and lost their money? Just look at reddit 2 years history about CB and you will see hundreds of cases when they lost their control of their money.  
**Coinbase is a bank, funded and created by the banksters (BBVA) to fool you!**  
They will track your money, your use of BTC, will give up all your info to IRS and other "3rd parties" and you will end up in even worst cases...  
Just an example:   
Buying BTC is NOT limited ONLY to Coinbase. CB is the worst place to go to buy BTC.  
BTW, when I see a merchant that redirect the payment page to a CB page, I immediately cancel the buy and never use that merchant. I will never directly link my identity with CB logs and users... NEVER !

Sorry, yes I am a strong critic of CB but I am not a shill for any other exchange.  
Criticism is good for both sides, shilling/promoting is wrong for both sides. CB started to be heavily promoted and sheeple jumped blindly into that wagon without thinking about consequences.  
99% of all exchanges that let people to trade BTC are manipulated or controlled by a "3rd party entity".  
Only P2P marketplaces are safe and the real way to obtain BTC. Prices on these marketplaces are almost impossible to manipulate and also you have minimum chances to have your account blocked or lose money, you are always in control of your money.  
For P2P decentralized money like Bitcoin is better to use P2P decentralized exchange, otherwise you are back to banksters manipulations.

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets (aka Conbase) = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

In a correct free market system, deflationary currency will never push the economy to a collapse, but to thrive. The free market MUST function properly otherwise we are just in a communist/socialist system.

There is also bitsquare.io a P2P decentralized exchange with integrated escrow service, but is limited to small amounts.  
Or just make a "shop" on [Open Bazaar]( (another P2P decentralized marketplace with integrated escrow), let your client know about it and he can buy directly with BTC from you. Will be his "problem" getting into BTC.

"Market cap" is a TOTAL NONSENSE!  
You can't compare limited supply of money with unlimited supply of money.  
At least we can do it comparing with gold but even then is something that is meaningless.  
Those who think that they will sell their btc for fiat because today is 1700 or 10k fiat they are fooling themselves. Because from the moment they bought BTC with less fiat until they sold the BTC for more fiat, that fiat value was decreased/devalued in the time they wait until sell, so they will buy less things with those "more money"...  
Let me put it in a simple way:  
- you have an apple tree in your garden that every year will make 100 apples that you sell me for 100$ (1$/each apple).  
-but next year I get a new printing machine that will make for me easy money whenever I want. So I will start printing when your tree is making apples.  
- you don't know that but for me the cost of printing is getting less and less every year and for your is harder and harder to have 100 apples  
-your supply is ALWAYS 100 apples no matter you want. My money supply is INFINITE anytime I want...  
So... do you think you will be richer if I pay you next year 200$ instead of 100$ for your 100 apples? NO WAY, the papers that I gave you are every year less valuable (worthless).  
Exactly the same happen with BTC now.  
But... one day you will say: "no more your worthless papers, from now on the currency will be my apples" and people will start making trades with your "apples".  
Guess what will happen? Your apples, being limited will became every year more valuable, because the supply is limited.  
Happy HODLing :) and ignore all those BS crap post about "marketcap is about 1 trillion of billions of worthless goat shit fiat papers!!!" Are just pumpers... When you hear them screaming, remember how was in Zimbabwe the "marketcap"....

Also WTF, these guys will start a fractional reserve for BTC? That's stupid and impossible. BTC will never be endless generated/mined. Very soon will stop the rewards for mining.

No need any central authority or exchange to issue for you a "paper" bitcoin. That means we are going back to IOUs worthless papers. There will be no proof that the issuer have the reserves to issue those papers and also there will be no guarantee that you will be in control of the private keys.

@_date: 2017-05-26 20:38:10
EXACTLY!  
I am inclined to say that this also could be another intent of the banksters to bring down the trust in Bitcoin, by manipulating the price.  
They bought many BTC during months (with their fake money of course) and now they are dumping, but hey not all at once. If you look closer, these drops happen 2 days in a row at the same time, with the same intensity and almost same volume, on all exchanges no matter is in which currency is.  
There will be another drops, for sure. This is just testing the **reaction**, to see if the newbies, the "new traders" have weak hands and follow their evil plan.  
It will be a big wave soon, to panic all, including the new HODLers. They will weak their trust and in the end will make them to sell.  
But hey banksters! I know you are reading this. We have news for you. We are many now. Much more than you can imagine. Those who we are real HODLers you can't trick us again. Me personally I will take a fiat loan and I will buy all the cheap BTC you drop even at $1/BTC, so you will not have anymore BTC in your fat pockets.  
We are many now! We will not surrender! This is not 2013! You fool us once but second time will be hell bad for you!  
**There is no turning point from here!**  
Ok let's do it! Throw all your BTC you fucking banksters! We are waiting for that! Your dirty tricks are not valid anymore!  
**WE ARE NOT SURRENDER! FUCK THE BANKSTERS!**

Looks like you are one of those that still doesn't know what is it... going on that side with "investors" definitely is the wrong understanding.  
Bitcoin is NOT an "investment" and wasn't designed to be anything like that.  
Maybe you should start with [Satoshi's papers](  
**"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."**  
In the whole document there is NO mention about "investment" or "investors"...  
But still we are in the phase when people still believe that fiat will exist for many years from now. I have news for them: Bitcoin is here to change the whole world as we know it, including the way we use money.

There is no such thing of "best wallet to keep your bitcoins safe".  
Any article that try to "present" the best wallet is a paid shill or just a blog that want more attention from noobs.  
Bitcoin wallets are just 2 categories:  
- those which respect 100% [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](  
- those which **do not respect** the rule mentioned.  
BTC wallets can have many or less functionalities, useful or not for the user but if the wallet do not respect the golden rule of Bitcoin doesn't matter anymore.  
I strongly recommend to any new BTC user to practice, test get used to have 2-3 wallets and use them, do not stick only with one wallet. Each wallet is an app, an interface to your BTC keys. Each one has his own features and functionalities that for some users will be useful for some not.  
REMINDER: the safety of your BTC is not in the wallet app, is in the option that gives you full control of your keys.

A lot. But I am a lucky early adopter (2012). I still have plenty of BTC. But I don't like that I am ripped off with high fees pushed by greedy miners. That's why I am organizing and calculating my "shoppings" trying to do them in calm days of mempool and limiting the high fees.  
But sincerely... every time when I pay with BTC or I receive BTC, I feel soo good, because .... **FUCK THE BANKS!**

Is a good question this.  
But this came to my mind: what stop banks to close your bank account and leave you without any of your money not just a stupid bill. And this happen many times, remember Cyprus, Greece, India, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil and so on...  
Personally I never have a problem like that (sending BTC and not paid bills) but if would be will be a legal problem and these companies will have to respond for their actions.  
My personal opinion is that this is an automatic process and will never be a "bad guy" in those companies taking the BTC and run.  
But again, I will not take out a possibility that a bill will not be paid. Everything can happen these days.  
That's why we have to do everything possible that ALL merchants will start accepting BTC directly so finally we can get rid of banks.

Even using Bisq I strongly recommend not to pass your country laws for P2P bank transactions. Some of them will trigger anyway the AML when you send more than 1000-3000€/tx or month. so be sure you know the rules.  
On Bisq you won't get ID verified but the bank transfer is still under the AML laws/rules. But that doesn't stop you to make multiple orders under the limit.

No need to be, when you charge the product, you input the value in fiat and your wallet will show up the value in BTC. Why is so difficult to understand this simple process? There are tons of videos and solutions for POS systems with BTC if you really want to fully integrate your BTC wallet into your accounting apps. But is not really not necessary. When is about to take the money, just show up a watch only wallet, put the amount in fiat and then show to the customer the generated QR code that already includes the amount in BTC. Customer just scan&amp;pay. Now you have recorded your sale as usual in your existing system, you pay taxes as usual for your sales. Bitcoin is just another payment method.

I will give you some clues to think:  
- shadow brokers (SB) = CIA creation to scare people and have a hidden hand to do dirty jobs.  
- CIA created the base of the ransomwares and used SB to spread them, pointing to russian hackers, north koreans, bitcoiners, whatever you want name them, anything you want to be the boogieman.  
- CIA with JPMorgan, created and funded ZCRASH, a kind of fedcoin, disguised in a crypto.  
- SB used some BTC to take some shit ransom but that is just a distraction to point media attention to Bitcoin and how bad it is.  
- now SB want to shapeshift those BTC because people are looking to them all days long like idiots, but they are just making CIA game, point out that BTC is traceable. So why not lose track of these BTC into a more controlled zcrash jpmorgan coin? A fake assumption that zcrash could be a good way to "hide" your coins, but in fact is another honey pot trap for idiots.  
Forget about SB, it was all a distraction. Do not give them more attention the deserve, aka zero. Attention mean playing their dirty game.

**What a BS article!**  


"Strict financial regulations in Norway, specifically to curtail money laundering and the financing of terrorist organizations, require banks know the origin of money involved in a transaction which, due to Bitcoin’s inherent anonymity, can cause problems. Hernaes made a point of saying that these regulations are not anti-Bitcoin, but in place to fight corruption. He did, however, acknowledge that they might not be able to approve all Bitcoin-related transactions, noting that this is just the first step as the bank ‘tests the waters’ of the cryptocurrency space."
So let's analyze a bit:  
1. Users will let that bank to **KNOW** which is their wallet address and private keys. That means **violation** of financial privacy. Bank can seize their wallet anytime, track their wallet anytime, stop the access to their wallet anytime. This means violation of [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( Who ignore this, deserve to be robbed by the bank.  
2. So they (banskters) saw that they can't control Bitcoin, then start controlling users, by making them to give away their private keys. Let's be clear, the "money laundering" and "terrorism" will be used anytime when banksters can't control the money flow. This is about **total control** and they use scaremongering to fool people. Being a free person and have financial privacy (that actually is a right) is seen as something really bad. People forget their rights!  
**Don't let them fool you (again)!**  
Use your damn BTC wallet, you don't a bankster to tell you what you do with your money!  
Bitcoin = Be Your Bank = Act accordingly   
Let's be clear: banking as we know it and Bitcoin are totally incompatible, will never work together, just because they will always violate The Golden Rule of Bitcoin. People, please learn this lesson, this is not a joke! What [Andreas was warning for years]( and many are laughing at this, but this is a serious aspect of Bitcoin and Bitcoin will never play fool with this. Bitcoin is **property** is not a stupid IOU paper!  
[Satoshi's papers, the first line saying, clear and loud](  
**"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another WITHOUT GOING THROUGH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION."**  
Bitcoin was created **EXACTLY** to get rid of all these scumbags blooodsuckers and yet they try fool again people. We don't need banksters anymore, they are desperate that they lose terrain really fast, but the asteroid is really close to their heads.  
We can do it without them, we can do it all P2P if we want.

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.

I started with Bitwage because some of payers didn't have BTC yet so they send the fiat and I received BTC.  
That was OK to use as middlemen Bitwage. It's a nice and easy way to be paid in BTC.  
But then the payers start having BTC, we cut the middlemen and they just send me the BTC, wallet to wallet.  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to cut the middlemen so why a "blockchain company" goes back to middlemen to pay with a currency that doesn't need middlemen?  
Remember the 1st line of Satoshi papers?!

If that will happen, Bitcoin will cease to exist. Bitcoin is based on the feature that no one can stop a transaction if that tx is correctly broadcast.  
What you are asking is exactly what banks are doing today. Bitcoin was created exactly to avoid that.  
Is not quite strange coincidence that NSA created tools like those ransomware, release them to the public, so the public will "demand" like you, that the addresses should be tracked and seized?  
Is not this sounds to you like the well known scenario, problem - reaction - solution?  
Is not NSA/gov those who want to see Bitcoin tracked or dead?

Coimbase is **not to be trusted** in any way. I will never buy from BTC from CB and will never make a payment through their platform. If I see a merchant that redirect my payment to a CB page I will cancel it and never buy from that merchant again! I will not link my identity with Coinbase.

In the moment the BTC price is crashing, you lost all your friends. Why?  
- because you were terrible at explaining them what really is BTC, so they didn't get it correctly  
- because they were thinking only "how to make money fast" and they bought at a peak.  
- they don't understand the term HODL

You're a bit wrong but I understand your "pain". When you spend it you have to buy back +10% more.  
I do that from 2012 until 2015 when I start being paid in BTC. I bought at any price, whenever I had some spare cash. If I use BTC, I buy back  + 10% more.  
Once you get paid in BTC you don't care anymore about the fucking price in fiat. Yes you will spend more wisely and HODL more.  
This is the first thing that Bitcoin will change in our mentality: save your money and don't spend them on stupid things.  
Fiat have another mentality: spend your money as much as you can on stupid things, take credits from endless printing money banks and let your grand kids paying the debt...

All those are INTERMEDIARIES, that means another gateway like paypal or VISA.  
This is NOT what Bitcoin was created for. Bitcoin doesn't need another intermediary to finish the payment.

Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](

BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc

Yes Changelly have some platform issues.  
Yes they have a real bad support response time.  
BUT no, they are not skimming their users. I had many exchanges with them, from mining with their sister company Minergate, yes, with many tx issues, but NEVER lost any coin with Changelly. Yes, were many delays, but in the end all OK, just have some patience and their system will send the money.

I never continue a payment in BTC if I see that is redirected to a Coinbase payment. NEVER!  
And I will not buy anymore from that merchant until they will give me a direct BTC address of them to pay.

I love to see all these posts about extremes: trillions of worthless goat shit for 1 BTC or the doom of BTC to 0$ (buahahaha).  
I love them because all of them are missing the whole point: we don't give a shit about the price in fiat of BTC. That price is just an illusion of wealth in fiat goat shit. That will never happen.  
Yes you could say: what I buy today with 1BTC I will buy in 1 year with only 0.5BTC. That can be a fair assumption.  
But saying that BTC will be sold in few years for 1 trillion of quadrillions of shit papers, means NOTHING.- Same way you say will worth $0.  
If BTC price will just reach 3000 or 5000USD in that moment many more people will realize that fiat money worth shit. So fiat will fucking die forever! So nobody will sell anymore for any goat shit fiat.  
So "businessinsider" please stick your article into your butt and throw out fiat shit. Is a total nonsense.

Why do you think Coinbase (and many other exchanges) always having "issues" when the price moves fast (up or down)?  
Coinbase is a bank, funded and created by the banksters (BBVA) and is the head of the spear into this.   
I can confirm what you just point out, my mom that was working in banking for 20 years also told this but a year ago. Some old friend of her, (he's still in some high circles of banksters) was really surprised when she told him about that she's converting her pension into BTC.   
**His answer was: "Oh, so you do like the big banks, buy BTC, but they have other "reasons" than you..."**  
I was stunned when my mom told me that. Immediately I make the connection: they are planning to dump them to crush the price like in 2013....  
**THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN! HODL your BTC! Do no make their evil stupid plan!**

Get started by understanding what really is Bitcoin. On the left side panel ---------&gt; you have lots of links to read.  
Jumping directly into "trading bitcoins" can end in breaking necks.  
Bitcoin is far more than just a speculation asset. Not understanding what really Bitcoin is, is like passing by the most important discovery of the world and say "ah whatever, not interesting".

Quite shit article, shill for usage "visa cards". Using those cards doesn't mean you are using BTC, but just keep using fiat. Giving to a merchant the same fucking plastic card from visa you will not give him the chance to take BTC.   
I live on BTC from 2015, closed all my bank accounts and not using those fucking visa cards. Just my BTC wallet.  
YES, is hard to do this, but you need determination to do it. I hate banksters so I have a very strong determination to do this.  
For more we use fiat as money, for more the banksters will survive.  
**Use your damn BTC wallet, push all the merchants to accept your BTC, push the companies to pay you in BTC for your work, push your suppliers to accept your BTC! Start from local level, around you.**  
When people will get out from their habits and mind the use of plastic cards then there will be adoption. But many people still think that the fucking plastic card is money. They are 100% wrong! That plastic is just more debt, more slavery to the banksters.  
I will remember to all those that didn't read [Satoshi's papers]( the definition of Bitcoin: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

Depends how you create your own "environment".

Nope. Is worst than Paypal. Coinbase is tracking every single move of your BTC wallet and give that info to the banksters/govs.  
That's why **when I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Coinbase payment page I will cancel the payment and never buy from that merchant anymore.**  
Bitcoin was designed to be WITHOUT any intermediary between parties of a payment and Coinbase act like an intermediary.  
I really don't understand WHY people forget the very first sentence of [Satoshi papers]( that is the most important thing for Bitcoin and for the future of humanity:  
**"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."**  
Simple as that, what role you see for Coinbase in this case? Why people IGNORE this very important thing?

That card is NOT BTC powered, that card is using ONLY fiat and is powered by fiat not by BTC.  
YOU are taking the BTC and give back goat shit fiat in form of those cards. You are just making the banksters game: keep the sheeple in line to use fiat and NOT BTC. This is NOT good for a Bitcoin company.  
OK I understand that you have to promote your BTC services (and some of them I use them and are great), but promoting VISA cards as a Bitcoin company is a real shame...  
**SHAME ON YOU BITWALA!**

Maybe, but then would not be Coinbase anymore, would be just another simple exchange trying to survive.  
Coinbase exist for a reason and is NOT to help people to use BTC, but to track them and give more info about them to their gov. Coinbase is the new Paypal for Bitcoin. and is in total contradiction with the first paragraph of [Satoshi's papers]( "Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution."  
In this case Coinbase IS the financial institution, disguised in a company that facilitate to users to buy/sell BTC. Convenience and easiness always hide something against your rights: privacy. There is NO privacy in using Coinbase.  
That's why when I see a merchant that redirect my payment to a Coinbase page, I will cancel it and never buy from that merchant anymore.

**You get it TOTALLY WRONG**:  
1. "invest some money in bitcoin" - you name money that worthless goat shit paper fiat? **Bitcoin IS REAL MONEY. [The rest are just IOUs.]( Don't "invest" in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not bonds, shares, stocks or whatever you think (wrong) it is. Bitcoin is your future. Invest in knowledge, invest in knowing better Bitcoin and you will have your future secured. Bitcoin is your insurance to have a great future.  
2. Coinbase and GBTC are NOT the only ways to acquire BTC. There are hundreds or thousands ways to get it. Coinbase is **the worst place on Earth to get BTC!** You have been warned! Coinbase was funded and created by the banksters to fool people to get easy into BTC but with a huge price: to be tracked, seized, taxed, controlled, jailed, robbed etc. I don't want to post again and again the long list of "issues" with Coinbase. See my posting history and you will find it.  
3. You want to get into this train? Start by working for bitcoins, start by using Bitwage.com if your employer still doesn't have BTC to pay you. start by selling stuff for BTC, start by using those hundreds of other exchanges and in special the P2P ones (see my previous posting for the entire list).  
In the end I strongly suggest you these 2 links:  
  
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:00:01
I am a freelancer and working with 2-3 clients. They pay me directly to my BTC wallet and I invoice them for my services in the currency they want. No more intermediaries.  
Is not so hard to ask your employer to pay you in BTC. Also a good way to be paid in BTC is to use Bitwage.com. Easy peasy no more hassle if they still don't have BTC to pay you, they can just send your salary to your Bitwage account and you receive BTC.  
BTC fees? Sorry but I am an early adopter, from 2012 so I have lots of BTC saved from early buys and in this moment, yes these fees are exorbitant, but hey, at least I know are going to some miners not to evil banksters.  
Soon all these problems will be gone.

What's your plan? Do you still trust the banksters and your gov ?  
Like Andreas A said: Bitcoin is the Revolution of TRUST.  
Bitcoin as Satoshi said in his papers is P2P decentralized money. Why not just use Bitcoin as money and forget about fiat?  
Using fiat as money you are just giving to the banksters a blank authorization for your enslavement. Using Bitcoin as money you take the power of controlling your money from them and live as a free person.

Mom: Where should I start?  
Me: Change your bank account to receive your pension with one of Cashila, automatically you can convert it into bitcoins. Use the wallet I created for you on your phone to move your BTC into it.  
She is doing this  from 2015, only that now is not using anymore Cashila, they close the retail.  
Now, from her pension, is sending to my daughter's wallet, BTC not worthless fiat.

Electrum Master Public Key (MPK).  
Launch Electrum wallet and get Master Public Key value from: Wallet -&gt; Master Public Key, or: older version of Electrum: Preferences -&gt; Import/Export -&gt; Master Public Key -&gt; Show.   
2. Copy long number string and paste it in this field.   
3. Change "gap limit" value to bigger value (to make sure youll see the total balance on your wallet): Click on "Console" tab and run this command: wallet.storage.put('gap_limit',100)   
4. Restart Electrum wallet to activate new gap limit. You may do it later at any time - gap limit does not affect functionlity of your online store.  
If your online store receives lots of orders in bitcoins - you might need to set gap limit to even bigger value.

It's a WRONG perception. The value of 1 BTC always would be 1 BTC. What fluctuates is the fiat not BTC.  
People are missing the point: Bitcoin is ALWAYS going up, slowly and with up/downs but will never go under. Why? Because it have a limited supply!  
The "volatility" you see is from the fiat because is on unstable waters and is about to crash. The whole system based on fiat is about to crash.  
A smart merchant, will NOT sell any BTC but will HODL a part of his BTC income and pay his employees in BTC. A merchant that will exchange his BTC into fiat and let that fiat in a bank account, in the end he will lose. If he will HODL in BTC will just win all the time.

Bitcoin is MONEY, [as it was mentioned by Satoshi Nakamoto in his papers](  
**Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
That's IT! Nothing else.  
Satoshi took the power of creating and controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now is time for the people to continue his great work and USE IT, to break free from the banksters slavery!  
Bitcoin will change the world as we know it in all aspects and will change our way of thinking. Slowly but will be. Many will disagree with me, but they are still blind.  
Bitcoin is a giant step in human history (I could say that is like the discovery of fire) and many will not let you think about that, because they are afraid of their "positions". Bitcoin is going to change many things in this world.

Yeah maybe I miss it but you can't compare it with P2P exchanges.  
P2P exchanges are NOT for trading for quick profits, are just to buy/sell BTC when is necessary, with the privacy and security of a P2P transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:11:58
Wrong. If you buy now to sell tomorrow is the wrong approach.  
I start buying in 2012  bucks, at any price, whenever I had some spare cash and didn't stopped buying until I start being paid in BTC. **BUT NEVER SELL**  
Will never sell for worthless goat shit fiat.

Use your damn BTC wallet and NOT a so called bitcoin debit card. All those cards are a joke, a pathetic intent of banksters to suck more blood from bitcoiners, pushing them back to use the fucking fiat.  
Don't be afraid of using your own BTC wallet! There are many places where to use your BTC directly.  
Those are NOT Bitcoin cards, ARE VISA/fiat cards!  
**Bitcoin doesn't need any intermediary to be spent. Going back to fiat (aka those cards) is NOT an option!**  
I am sick of all these bloodsuckers that they just want to keep people using fiat and [putting a horse in front of a car](  
This is again another banksters trick to fool people NOT to use their P2P money, but giving away their freedom of using their own Bitcoin wallet!  
People should always remember the 1st line of [Satoshi's papers](  
**"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."**   
These cards are just pushing you back to those "financial institutions" that Satoshi wanted to get rid of them!  
Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now (stupid) people want to give back that power to the banksters... what a shame!

This is not a joke at all!  
Bitcoin is here to change totally our way of thinking, way of living, way of administering our money.  
Bitcoin is NOT here to adapt to existing societies, economies, mentalities. Bitcoin is here TO CHANGE all those as never was before. Many people wants to adapt Bitcoin to existing systems, but in fact Bitcoin will change all the systems as we know them.  
Not having anymore banksters to fund and manipulate them, govs will cease to exist slowly replaced by blockchains and DAOs.  
Our children yes, they will see that.

@_date: 2017-06-14 06:16:55
Acceptance is done by each one of us. I start talking with merchants and neighbors in my local area, I did BTC meetings, teach them and we help each other.  
all start like that, not by waiting until a giant X merchant announced that they accept BTC.  
Yes, I am not traveling too much and all my BTC I spend are in my local area. There are many merchants that accept BTC, but they are a bit afraid to say it loud so they do it only with local clients, that they know them.

I will not tell you exactly, but I will tell you my "vision and strategy".  
I start in 2012 with my first buy  from a friend miner. I never stopped buying until 2015, every time I had a spare cash I bought at any price.  
Then I mined, with CPU, GPU, USB.  
Then I start working for BTC (in 2015).  
Then I start living on BTC.  
Then I closed all my bank accounts, so I can't sell anymore :)!  
BUT NEVER SELL! WILL NEVER SELL! What for?! [For the worthless goat shit fiat?](

Oh you mean UZNazi... yes you people have deep inside stuck the plastic cards... Here in EU we start waking up and get rid of them.  
Why should be risky to be paid in BTC? today is more risky to be paid in fiat, because from the moment you are paid until you get to the bank to take your money, they will close the bank or your access to the money.  
Each time I am paid I generate a new BTC address, then I shapeshift all the income into altcoins and back to 4-5 more new BTC addresses. The payer will never know where my money are. Including my fucking bloodsucker government.  
Working for BTC today is quite easy. But people are afraid to ask their employer: "can you pay me in BTC please ?"

Is not because the majority of people are lazy and don't have balls. They just wait until a big fucking gov, merchant or whatever will announce that from now on they accept BTC. Even then they will not spend their BTC because they still want to sell it for fiat (IDIOTS).  
Only those who really understand what Satoshi said in the first phrase of his papers, will use Bitcoin **AS MONEY** and breakout from banksters slavery.  
I am sure that more than 80% of r/Bitcoin users didn't read Satoshi's papers and from those who read it only 50% understand exactly what Satoshi created.  
Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. If we do not use and understand this fact, we are doomed to be sheeple forever...

Bitcoin "issues" will be fixed and many other "issues" will be again. That will make Bitcoin even stronger.  
All those "invested" companies, govs and people will just be lost. Yes maybe there will be a bit of chaos, but from chaos will rise a fair order, the order of Bitcoin.

Use your damn BTC wallet and NOT a so called bitcoin debit card. All those cards are a joke, a pathetic intent of banksters to suck more blood from bitcoiners, pushing them back to use the fucking fiat.  
Don't be afraid of using your own BTC wallet! There are many places where to use your BTC directly.  
Those are NOT Bitcoin cards, ARE VISA/fiat cards!  
**Bitcoin doesn't need any intermediary to be spent. Going back to fiat (aka those cards) is NOT an option!**  
I am sick of all these bloodsuckers that they just want to keep people using fiat and [putting a horse in front of a car](  
This is again another banksters trick to fool people NOT to use their P2P money, but giving away their freedom of using their own Bitcoin wallet!  
People should always remember the 1st line of [Satoshi's papers](  
**"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."**   
These cards are just pushing you back to those "financial institutions" that Satoshi wanted to get rid of them!  
Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now (stupid) people want to give back that power to the banksters... what a shame!

I am quite afraid of these "in-wallet buy options". This could be a strong violation of financial privacy that a personal private BTC wallet will offer.  
Any intermediary into a tx like this "in-wallet buy" could be a tool to track BTC users and add to watch list, monitor usage of those addresses.  
Watch out! You could end up in a gov list of registered bitcoin users and there will be a day when they will use it.  
This is like when Facebook was launched, everybody wanted to be in, but they never think that there is no way out from CIA watch list... we all know that FB is a CIAbook.  
Coinbase is doing this for your own gov for years now and people forget too easy some important things:

See the top of that list. P2P is the way to have lowest fees and the most trusted way to do a transaction (you are always in control of your money).  
In Bitcoinlandia we say: Don't trust, VERIFY.

There is no such thing of "best wallet to keep your bitcoins safe".  
Any article that try to "present" the best wallet is a paid shill or just a blog that want more attention from noobs.  
Bitcoin wallets are just 2 categories:  
- those which respect 100% [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](  
- those which **do not respect** the rule mentioned.  
BTC wallets can have many or less functionalities, useful or not for the user but if the wallet do not respect the golden rule of Bitcoin doesn't matter anymore.  
I strongly recommend to any new BTC user to practice, test get used to have 2-3 wallets and use them, do not stick only with one wallet. Each wallet is an app, an interface to your BTC keys. Each one has his own features and functionalities that for some users will be useful for some not.  
REMINDER: the safety of your BTC is not in the wallet app, is in the option that gives you full control of your keys.

I will tell you my experience with Bitwage. Started in 2015 to accept only BTC from my clients (i'm freelancing).  
I gave them a notice saying that from now on my service invoices can be paid:  
- with fiat bank transfer will have a surcharge of 15%  
- with fiat bank transfer to my Bitwage account, no surcharge  
- with BTC directly to my BTC wallet, 5% discount  
Gues what? Nobody wanted anymore to pay with bank transfer. Now I have few paying to my Bitwage (they still can get BTC directly) and many pay already wallet to wallet.  
Bitwage is the best way to get fast and reliable to get BTC straight into your wallet.  
If you still do not want all your income in BTC, you can split fiat/BTC in your Bitwage account and also you can use their partnership with XAPO card.  
Me personally I prefer ALL IN BTC! Fuck fiat.  
Forget about endless problems with exchanges, verify identity etc. Exchanges are only for those who want to make trading BTC/fiat. If you just want some BTC use Bitwage and forget about issues.

Coinbase is NOT a Bitcoin wallet!  
Coinbase is a bank, funded and created by the banksters and will always act like a bank.  
Are you still trust a bank?  
**You have been warned**, you will end up like many others in this list of Coinbase ex-losers

It's about regulating Bitcoin exchanges, NOT the currency Bitcoin. It is a big difference.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:50:26
Please stop these price nonsense predictions.  
The BTC price in BTC is unreal and actually is representing the **RAMPANT DEVALUATION OF FIAT** not the appreciation of BTC.  
There will be a point when trading BTC for fiat will be meaningless, nobody will use anymore fiat.  
Is really stupid to think that you will sell at 100k in few years. You will never sell, because what you buy today with 100$ you will buy with 100k$ in few years, so [you will be a "rich guy" in worthless goat shit fiat](  
**STOP FOOLING YOURSELF THAT YOU WILL SELL FOR A TON OF GOAT SHIT!**

NOTHING!  
I did that in 2015. I closed all my bank accounts, converted all my money into BTC and start being paid in BTC.  
r/LivingOnBitcoin IS REAL!  
FUCK BANKS! FUCK FIAT!
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:16:13
I pay bills, rent, groceries and being paid in BTC from 2015. Don't tell me that r/LivingOnBitcoin is not REAL.  
The first step in BTC adoption is not using the VISA bridge but closing your bank accounts. If you don't have balls for that, you are just an opportunist and you don't really appreciate BTC as its real value: FREEDOM.  
Using those "VISA bridges" [you just put the horse in front of your car]( and you will never have full BTC adoption, just because merchants will be so lazy to accept your BTC when you just give them the same fucking VISA card.
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:27:07
You could use also bitwage.com, They just send regular payment to bitwage bank account and you receive BTC same day.

Wallets are just the interface app that gives you the option to control your bitcoins. You could take the private keys/seed and use them into any other wallet app.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:29:29
When BTC price reach 10k, already NOBODY will sell anymore for that worthless goat shit. So the "target" 100k is just a useless "prediction".  
So what? Idiots will sell their BTC for tons of fiat IOUs to use them [like wallpapers or worst?](

**There is no such thing "best wallet".**  
Bitcoin wallets are just 2 big categories:  
- those which are supporting [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](  
- those which don't  
People always first go is to choose convenience and NOT safety. Always they think safety is that the app is not hackable, but there is no such thing.  
The safety is the feature that gives you FULL CONTROL OF YOUR MONEY!  
That's why Satoshi took the power of controlling/creating money from the banksters and give it to the people. Yet stupid people give back that power to banksters by using wallets that do not respect [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( This is the most important thing in Bitcoinlandia. If you ignore it, YOU LOSE!  
Here is a list of wallets, choose wisely:   
Don't stick only with one, spread your stash, use in dual mode, use 2-3 in the same time, each wallet have his own features/functionalities that can be your ally in each occasion you have to use them.

Gov/banksters fucked me in 2011 so I was looking how to fuck them back. A good friend of mine, BTC miner, told me about BTC and I start reading, then booom, realized that this is the way we can fuck the banksters!

r/LivingOnBitcoin is REAL no matter you want it or not.

**Financial privacy is a human right NOT a privilege just for the banksters...**

Even then is quite stupid to publish your BTC address on reddit.

Nope, **THIS is the real graph**, because the fiat devaluate at rampant pace.
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:39:50
r/LivingOnBitcoin is REAL, you just need determination to do it. [I have that determination because I HATE BANKS!](  
Yes is hard to live on BTC today, with all the issues but I will never go back to fiat. Why?  
Because Satoshi put it very well and clear on his [Bitcoin papers](  
**Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
That's it! There is no need anymore for the fucking bloodsucking banks. I am the [**Decentralized Banker**]( from now on!
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:23:43
Yes it is, because people are starting to wake up and understand that they still have some rights.  
This is not about hiding black money, this is not about illegal activities, is just about a basic right: privacy.  
People today are too used  to give up their rights and privacy in the name of so called "fight against criminals" but in fact real criminals are those that are taking your rights and privacy.  
Bitcoin is here to change that. Finally people will understand how to protect their privacy, just by using Bitcoin.  
As I said here, [**Bitcoin is here to change this fucking stupid world**](
