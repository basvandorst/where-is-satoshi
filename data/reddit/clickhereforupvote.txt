I couldn't agree more.
Bitcoin at the moment is great for the big players but is 100% unusable as a day-to-day currency due to insane fees. And I know that sounds more like than but I suppose everyone understands this. I, too, am just hodling till this thing turns into something useful.

Thanks. I have other coins but the main purpose would be to secure my BTC for a long period of time.

TSLA not so much. A normal person like us wouldn't be able to get past the giant funds hogging all the shares.

Can anyone please clarify how people do this?
Whenever I bought BTC in the past year, the fee alone was so high, I had to buy at least $100 just to make the fee seem reasonable...

I might do something like that. I already have my 12 word recovery phrase but then I'm still prone to Blockchain.info hacks, no?

I really want one but I don't want to spend $10 to move my low amount of BTC onto the wallet. Is there any way to do this for free? My BTC is on Blockchain.info

Pretty new to bitcoin and only a casual investor but I'm wondering if there is a solution to the high fees?
It seems like a major hurdle in Bitcoin adoption when your fee costs more than your coffee?

You can exchange your mined coins in their web dashboard. I haven't tried it yet but the button is there.

Transaction fee included?
