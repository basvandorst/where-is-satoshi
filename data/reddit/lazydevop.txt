Well, FDIC insurance is not the only way to recover damages. It's just easier and more likely to happen. If you sue Coinbase, they have to respond to that. If the money isn't there for a judgement I guess you are fucked though.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:05:02
LOL, maybe so. But it makes sense that the formal threat of a lawsuit broken down in detail may elicit a response without having to go through all the bullshit. So, it's worth a shot.

I don't think BTC has the power to topple governments, and I don't think greedy people are going to stay away from anything that has to do with money.

He's playing Satoshi Dice with your missing bitcoins. After he doubles it, he'll put them back in your account.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:47:33
They would probably respond by giving you your money back, and hopefully paying your filing fee back. Assuming you give them a reasonable chance to remedy the situation before filing a lawsuit. But before you file the lawsuit, the correct thing to do is to send a demand letter which states what happened, the steps you have taken to attempt to resolve it, what you are requesting be done, and what you will do if you do not receive a response within usually seven business days or so.

Yeah the CFPB is basically dismantled at this point LOL. But, what I was saying is that there may be grounds for a win-able civil lawsuit or arbitration under California law regardless of whatever the TOS and user agreement say. Coinbase has made a promise to deliver something. You can't just sell something, take the cash and then not give what you were supposed to. 
Being extremely swamped due to shitty business decisions is still their fault, and while it doesn't constitute fraud it is most certainly negligent.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:43:55
Well, he passed the KYC requirements for both Coinbase and the bank he uses. So how the fuck would that happen and why does it take over a month to resolve the situation? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:35:02
I'm not alleging that they are stealing anyone's money. My allegation is that they are negligent, and what the reasons are for the negligence don't really matter. It's their responsibility as the seller to hold up their end of the bargain. I also do not think that the feds would interrupt a transfer to investigate it. That would just tip off the parties involved.

Plus Coinbase used to respond to complaints in a customer friendly way. I actually hit up their support about a mistake I made asking if they could reverse some of the fees (because, IMO if you don't ask, you can't get it anyway). I didn't think they would do it, and this was in early 2016. But they did reverse about $10 in fees which was really nice (although, they were a little snippy about it). But now, they not only don't give a fuck about looking good, they just ignore shit entirely and I guess the squeaky wheel gets the grease. But if the squeaky wheel isn't the guy filing complaints with agencies over $40k USD missing for over a month then WTF is the squeaky wheel? Are they getting sued? How many cases are pending against Coinbase right now?

Yeah I moved my whole portfolio into XRP at $0.24, $0.51 and $0.70 over the course of this month after some profit-taking on BTC, BCH, and LTC. I knew this was coming man, I have been in the space since 2009 and made plenty of mistakes over the years. This is pretty normal actually. I think there's a lot of factors here: Coinbase scamming, BCH bullshit, Futures, and the profit taking after the prices have hit a ceiling. I should have sold XRP at $1.37 last night and bought back in at $0.74 but that would have been an emotional decision which could have gone either way.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:53:55
You're right man. There's so many BTC noobs now that nobody can see what is going on except for those who have been in this long enough to understand the space.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:48:22
There is still quite a bit of risk involved given the transaction time, volatility, and the potential for liquidity problems if the price trend changes while you are waiting and you are moving into a smaller exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:02:56
I think they have a vault or cold storage wallet don't they? I'm not saying that I'd trust it though.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:06:55
Well, it is up 33% over 24h and briefly surpassed Ethereum as number 2 by market cap, so it looks like you're wrong about that. Not sure what evolution has to do with any of this stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:21:31
15% isn't that much?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:04:37
There are a handful of individuals who hold a shitload of almost all the currencies who can very drastically affect the price. But even XRP is decentralized and not controlled by Ripple. In fact, it's been around since 2004 ish. Bitcoin is not special in any other way than it's market cap and awareness IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:07:51
Not all of them will. XRP just doesn't have these issues.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:01:39
Yeah, I agree but it is still a pretty notable change in price, and given his personal connections you can't say that isn't a little suspect.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:37:11
That's true. I was more referring to BTC arbitrage which I did some of a long time ago. I mean, we are on But you're right. There's even programs out there that you can buy which basically just skim money off the markets for you all day.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:07:34
It's actually pretty damn hard to build on a protocol that is being used in a massive distributed network. People have to all agree on that, or mostly agree. Even with lightning protocol bitcoin is going to see problems with volatility and therefore widespread adoption. If drug dealers don't even like it that much, why would internet retailers or coffee shops? It's much more complicated and a way bigger pain in the ass than cash is. And at this point, it's all just bitcoin fanboys (which I used to be, back when things were sane) and speculators holding the currency. But it's actually being used less and less for real world transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:28:25
I never said I got rich off of it. I did CPU mine on a Core2 Duo E8500 though lol, then I GPU mined 2012-2013, and early-ASIC mined (with the USB ASIC's). I also bought and sold BTC on MtGox and used it to buy psychedelics. I've made a lot of mistakes and didn't see the potential really. And in hindsight, it makes sense still why I didn't - it's tough to predict. I have learned a lot doing all that stuff though. I see where you are coming from though.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:13:49
And many protocols have been ditched in the process - IPX/SPX, and soon http (without SSL) and IPv4. So by this comparison, let's not be delusional and think that a superior technology can't overtake BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:37:46
Yep, and the Litecoin guy who works there sold all his LTC (which doesn't matter) but he had to go and tell everyone publicly about it which can have only one effect on the price and that's exactly what he intended to do. FUCK COINBASE.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:13:21
Well, I'm sure he's connected enough with the people over there for it to really not make a difference whether he's getting a check from coinbase or not. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:38:52
Why don't you come back and talk to me when you can properly format an argument, spell correctly, and use proper grammar. Who's they? What is bitcoin - it is a digital asset that we've decided has value, residing on a network controlled by the people you are probably calling "they." You need to stop talking about bitcoin like some kind of religious zealot man. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:20:03
That's not going to happen anytime soon buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:58:37
You don't know what you're talking about. You can go look at the XRP source on github, and you can take a look at how long XRP has been around. Do some research on who owns most of the BTC. It is actually worse that they are individuals. BTC is outdated and shitty and will not have a place at the table in the near future. XVG and XRP will be the top two eventually unless some other players come in and improve on them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:33:18
Yeah, I mean I will give you this, Bitcoin has been around a long time, is well known, and has a provably secure blockchain and core. With lightning protocol and some of the other developments it has potential to go somewhere way bigger than anything we are seeing today but the market cap even at it's floor right now is a little scary when you compare it to the actual uses it has. The transaction times for a regular bitcoin transaction even back in 2013 were a little high. Not a problem for a currency that doesn't have extreme volatility, but how can bitcoin not have a lot of volatility? I guess when enough people hold it and the market cap is extremely huge and it is usable as a currency, but it has had a long road and has a lot of hurdles ahead of it if that is ever to happen. Making it through this crazy speculative phase while changes are being made to the technology and it is being attacked by stupid shit like BCH and falling victim to Coinbase (whom I hate with a passion) and so on is going to be tough.
I am happy to have learned the hard lessons and I try to communicate that to people on here as best I can because I see a lot of people doing terribly stupid things (things I wouldn't have done even when I was new at it). It's actually sad to see all of this stuff happening. I guess I feel a sense of responsibility to people who think they are now day traders all of the sudden, most of them know nothing about all of this stuff. 
Anyway, all these lessons I've learned over the years will pay off in different ways throughout life in the form of sizing up new tech early on, seeing potential, being realistic, and gauging human behavior properly - all important things for an investor. 
I think one of the most important lessons here is not really being sad about not doing things differently, it sort of had to happen that way and hopefully there will be an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of something else (crypto or otherwise) that will be a game changer. Money isn't everything, and certainly not worth going into a deep depression or killing yourself over. Just being alive and healthy is pretty enjoyable and I have a lot to be grateful for without being a millionaire.

Yeah man, things were amazing back then.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:49
I have been in BTC since 2009 and I'm totally out of it since a few weeks ago. I don't think it's going to permanently die in a short period of time because it has the largest network and has never been hacked (the tech itself). This does not make me an expert or some kind of oracle but I'd say my opinion is valid enough.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:24:23
You can't beat yourself up over this shit. It does really suck, but even if we had held onto them there has been so much opportunity to just freak out and think it's time to get out. I remember seeing BTC hit $40 and think it's way overpriced LOL. 2013.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:56:12
Jeez. Well, it would be nice to have the money but 2mil is easy to burn through. Don't go killing yourself man.
Buy some cheap altcoins like ripple maybe.

Mass speculation isn't the same as mass adoption. None of these people are using bitcoin to pay for anything, transfer money like moneygram/western union, or save money. That stuff is happening, but this is the single biggest bubble I've ever seen in my life. I'm still making money off of it though and I've been in for a long time and used it as a currency plenty though. We should be realistic here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:49:08
It wasn't there long though :( and GDAX was all fucked up.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:22:32
Yeah, and if anybody should have the talent, money, and market sense to run a fucking BTC exchange / trading platform properly it should be CoinBase. I mean, WTF are they doing over there. It's pretty clear the "login issues" and "minor service outage" etc is all due to high API requests and their cluster behind CloudFlare.

Good points man, thanks for the perspective. The volatility is still a problem, but it could just be growing pains.

I used to throw whole bitcoins around like they were worth less than a dollar. Because they were. And I have none of them anymore. I do have .04345 BTC though from last November.

Right after they poisoned that regulator making it look like he had a heart attack? That's a little suspicious.
