Take a look at batch 3.
March 25th: Ordering opened.
May 30th: Expected ship date.
 August 7th: When I received my machines.
Assuming 70btc each for 600 units at the market price on March 25th, that's about $4,000,000 worth of units that were about 3 months late.
I wish they were only a month late. Keep the faith... they seem to get there. Just add 3 months for avalon.

Every ASIC manufacturing company so far has overshot deadlines by months and months. We'll see how they turn out.
28nm architecture? Intel uses 22nm on their last line of CPUs. The drastic performance increases are going to stop soon.

They really aren't. You should see the threads on it on the forum.

That's something thats going to need to get fixed somehow.
Having transactions take forever to confirm will kill bitcoin.

Avalon produces and sells the units in batches (batch 2 in title). They only make so many per batch and it's a first come first serve basis.
Batch 2 opened for sale early in februrary for $1499 and they only accept bitcoins at payment. I think at the time that was around 80 bitcoins or so. Right now batch 2 is shipping out.
The last batch that went on sale was batch 3 which opened march 25th and sold for 75 bitcoins each. If i remember correctly bitcoins were ~$90 at the time putting the total cost around $6750 per unit.
Batches sell out quick so you have to be fast. I think batch 3 sold out within the first day with small windows of availability as some orders fell through.
