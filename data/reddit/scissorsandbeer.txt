Ah, the difference here is whether you're moving USD or coins. USD is insured on Coinbase, but coins are not.

Also, when you bought the coins, some of your initial purchase money probably went to fees, so it'll take some growth in the coins to offset the purchase fees before you see growth.

Why the fuck would you mash F5 on GDAX, it live updates...

Gdax is an EXCHANGE it is NOT A SECURE WALLET. Gdax is for trading only, NOT storage. Please please do not store your coins on an exchange : )
But to your other question, depositing/withdrawing BTC to/from gdax couldn't be simpler. Go to your "accounts" tab on Gdax (top right of page), and you'll see your balances of USD, BTC, ETH, and LTC. Each balance has a little "down arrow" for deposits. Clicking that button just gives you an "address" that will allow you to send the relevant fund type to your GDAX account. The "up arrow" is to withdraw your funds, and you'll enter an "address" you get from another location.
Edit: You log into GDAX with the same login credentials as Coinbase. Moving coins/funds between the two locations is even simpler than using the "address" system because they are the same company, just with a different "face" and different fees/uses.

Personally, any time Bitcoin starts going up or down, I rush to the front page to look for the rollercoaster meme.
