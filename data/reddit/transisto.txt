No you can't be 100% anonymous, I had to provide passport and proof of address. Apart from their fee scam, which I think they can be sued for, they pay out interest to people keeping their bitcoin there, apparently they're making money doing arbitrage aka "trading". That is a giant red flag, even if they give 0.00001% back per year. It's an additional risk and there are huge systemic risk with any bitcoin exchanges. The risk to me is definitely not worth it.

Is this better ?
    concerned with the "notification address" 
    requirement, which entails address reuse and blockchain spam. Since it entails 
    address reuse, the recipient is forced to either leave them unspent forever 
    (bloating the UTXO set), or spend it which potentially compromises the private 
    key, and (combined with the payment code) possibly as much as the entire 
    wallet.
    
    Instead, he suggest making it a single zero-value OP_RETURN output with two 
    pushes: 1) a hash of the recipient's payment code, and 2) the encrypted 
    payment code. This can be searched with standard bloom filters, or indexed 
    with whatever other optimised algorithms are desired. At the same time, it 
    never uses any space in the UTXO set, and never needs to be 
    spent/mixed/dusted.

One of the thing that worries me is the code review.
For me it need to not only be open sourced but also sufficiently reviewed before I secure a significant amount into a multisig.

You missed the part where one side say they will do Blocksize increase after segwit and the other that say they will fix maleability (segwit) after.  And both side to do trust each other to follow up on their promise.
The compromise is for segwit ship also with a postponed 2mb block increase.
That mean, If you accept segwith you also accept a 2mb HF.  Anything above 2mb is risky and would not get passed at this time.

I foresee miner openly running a version that activate after 60% of last 1000 block agree as the worst case.  60% of 1000 block can be mined by less than 50% because of variance in block finding. If that happen then we're in deep shit.  Nobody debate using a variation of trigger under the form of dates + 88% of last 888 blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:03:37
It mean both scalability and fungibility as well as speed of transaction can be fixed without a hard fork.

Now, what ATM manufacturer is considering RBF (Replace by fee) transactions as any safe?
My wild guess is they should be the one responsible to cover this lost to the operator.
Edit: Was GenesisCoin 
@_date: 2019-03-13 05:47:04
They were accepting RBF (replace by fee) zero-conf which are specifically designed to instruct miners that it should be allowed to be replaced.
@_date: 2019-03-13 05:38:10
I would accept a non-RBF zero-conf of 1050$ worth of BTC in exchange of 1000$ if the fee is ~3 times higher than last 10 block average.
If you can figure out an easy way to do that online I'd be willing to put money where my mouth is.

To speed it up some have a web interface where you send your Bitcoin prior then go pick pick up the cash in exchange of some code you get sent as SMS.
@_date: 2019-03-13 01:27:25
Might sound risky but non-RBF zero-conf are safe for small amounts and 1-conf are safe for most-all ATM sized transaction.
I'm almost certain they were RBF transaction if the manufacturer consider those the same as non-RBF that's obvious incompetence on their side.
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:52:39
I'm willing to risk 1000$ to make 50$ to make a point to you.
If you think there is no simple way to do that than for me to buy and setup an ATM you're an idiot or don't have the balls to take the bet.
Zero-conf are not at all to be relied on, we're just dealing with odds that I evaluate at 5% or less.
BTW these transaction were all RBF!
@_date: 2019-03-14 05:38:26
I have detail of one of the double spend at an ATM of my partner and it's a RBF.
Thanks for taking so much time to think about it, finding out what is the actual risk cost money (unless you ask and trust what code miner say they run.) and will eventually get riskier and riskier as the hash power decentralize and the block reward diminish vs fees. So I'm not even interested in monitoring that risk... Thiefs will do though if an opportunity is presented. 
@_date: 2019-11-19 20:44:23

I understand what you mean but I think we've come a long way from explaining why a MtGox yubi was a bad purchase given GA already provide a significant increase in security.
Given your use-case of needing to access a very secure PC with a static password, for example a Truecrypted OS, depending on the frequency it need to be accessed and the required entropy, a static password into a yubi may be less secure and less convenient than typing a padding part (fast) followed by a medium entropy string. For example typing the keyboard pattern "asd654asd654asd654asd654" take about 1.2 second and can provide sufficient entropy when combined with an easily memorable word. Compared to the time spend accessing the yubi, the risk of theft, the risk of having it being read unknowingly if left untended.
I see the use of a static yubi bank as a benefits if one's is at high risk of being seen while typing the password or as a complement to a wireless keyboard entry witch I'd avoid at all cost.

No the network pay 50btc per 10 min (on average).   This will change to 25btc in early 2013.
The 599 is older generation that mine to the tune of 1ghs, the company decided it would be replacing these with newer generation unit (ASICs) That cost 1200$ , So returning old unit and adding 600$ will give you something that hash 40ghs.  This is 40/24000 of the network, or 0.00166 which equate reward of 0.5btc per hours.
The difficulty adjust itself every two week so that valid results are found every 10min (50btc reward)

I personally have a few standard yubikey that I use for LastPass beside mtGox.
Less secure because ;
Running google auth on a smart phone is roughly the same as running a software on a 2nd PC which is likely as vulnerable if not more than the host PC.
The Google Auth (as as app) does not, per se, require physical press of a button in the same "hardware" way.
The yubi is more convenient to me because once inserted it take rougtly 1 sec to press the button instead of having to launch an app and type a string of numbers, (had many issue with off time / wrong timezone)
How would you use a yubi static password in combination with a lastpass account ?   Would you use the static password on bank 1 and OTP on the 2nd ? 
When large and static entropy is needed I usually pad my password with repetitive, easy to remember, strings.

Completely agree,  There no way to import / export / save wallets, 
That wouldn't be such a problem if the wallet wasn't saved in a default and protected folder,  I had corruption problem on my C drive,
 I could install the client on another drive but could not have it to save my wallet at a safe place. "AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin"

The increased centralization of mining might create a little dip but not for long, The increase in hashrate is one of the best thing that can happen to the network's longterm viability.
Selling bitcoin now and expecting to buy later is extremely risky, the ASICs trend is upward, the bitcoin trend is upward too and the value is underrated anyway (

I'll do some math for fun, 
I want to buy 250btc
trading fee 2.5% 
( GST is being included in the transaction fee.)
122$ for buying 4500$ worth of bitcoin
40$ is 3%+hst-0.6%* of ~1560$
*(Mtgox is 0.6%)
So around 1560$+ you're much better off wiring to mtgox.

How many printer actually have enough non-volatile memory to contain a full picture let alone a few ? NONE,  unless it has a harddrive, in which case it's rather obvious or easy to find out.
print your wallet as a screen capture, then send another picture to print behind.
mid-high end printer often have very little RAM (16 to 128mb ) and very few have HDD,  From my experiences I can say a high resolution picture barely fit into 64mb of ram, and anyway you can just power it off and ram get erased.

I found your answer to be rather lengthy for a ELI5 and since I understand much of bitcoin already I haven't read it so pardon me if my comment is irreverent.
  From my experience explaining bitcoin to 5 and 65+ I agree, you have to swallow it all to understand how any parts of it really work.  I always begin by explaining encryption as a one way function then go on to explaining P2P, signature of signatures + transactions, (blockchain) , the random nature of mining ect.

I think it's a good idea because for the last 30 day's we've been told abut the queue of 25 000 verification.  That in itself should be a signal the price is to go up.  But for all we know it could be manipulated too.
So between sporadic vague disclosure and full public disclosure I think the later should prevail.
MtGox has an this unfair advantage if trading on it's exchange and the market would find a way to adapt around the variations in dormant funds (usd/btc)

+1 for Van Eck and video surveillance, which are both easy to deal with.
As for running a javascript on a offline and clean machine I think it's very secure if you can read the *short* code. How is it vulnerable to side channel attack ?

Thanks for the tip, I'll look into it.

Gavin himself is against making the client attractive or easy to use.  Bitcoin customer support is at full capacity right now.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:35:27
That's been taken care of already ;)

MSM likes easy to understand stuff like "bitcoin now worth 1B$"
@_date: 2013-06-28 05:47:45
This is a very good idea,

**Please try understand what I mean before down-voting.**
What will you do with your 1920 BTC that you couldn't have done with what you had before + hard work over time ?
If you can't answer that question you're still a looser.
@_date: 2013-01-25 04:28:46
What amount are you looking for ?

I completely agree, but there are **RARE** occasions when gambling is a worthwhile risk to take.
When you have more to gain than to lose from the odds, for example : Given limited funds and time constrain an opportunity arise that require this much money and would allow with good certainty a larger profit in the future.
Example : "I've been offered this awesome job but I need "X" much to purchase the equipment by Y time or I loose the opportunity."
It's sad to know that 99.9% of gambling is not used for that purpose.

look for btccharts.com for having almost all exchange and pairs on the same screen.

Would tip more if I could get the data in a consumable form.
I don't know how you did it but it seems like you're 95% there.

How so if people downvote the crap ?
@_date: 2013-06-16 18:33:40
Why ? I personally trust BitFunder more, is that why ?
I tend to have my shares spread across the two.

New blocks are found every ~10 minutes,
An interesting submission would be, "I found a block solo mining @ 800mhs"

Bitcoinica most likely.

He willfully released the bitcoinica source code which contained the API key to mtGox while there was a group willing to pay the ~60 000 btc lost by a previous hack, A 50 000$ + 50 000btc theft ensued, (supposedly made by Chen, the imaginary friend of Zhou Thong.)

Irony ? Bitpay isn't an exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-06 09:03:02
I think it's more ~80 000 BTC total
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:49:14
25btc per module, and 0 btc for everything else , I wonder who though of that pricing.
@_date: 2013-03-05 22:57:01


And bitcoin "being added to the volume at an exchange" or not are part of the market cap.
