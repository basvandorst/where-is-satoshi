For all the Coinbase hate, I have had nothing but good experiences with them. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:00:32
Can you not use Tor?

Has anybody actually tracked the number of transactions in and out of Greece lately? 
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:54:12
Keep up the good work.

I like the fact he is not putting up with any BS and calling people out on it. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:11:57
[Well they have nodes running.]( Not that you can really tell anything from that. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 01:05:53
It would be cool to get actual tickets with bitcoins. Not sure if AT&amp;T would let me pay that part of my cable with it though. I have been to at least 5 UFC events and they are fucking amazing. Would definitely support this and get some more awareness for bitcoin and the sub as well.

Can't we just raise that money and pour the shit on BFL Josh? I mean let him think he is charge of dumping the shit, but we rush him and pour the shit on him. That is an idea I can get behind. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:06:50
Not gonna lie, I am [this]( excited about the price going up.
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:42:42
Wipe first. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 20:47:24
Same here. Withdrew my entire BTC balance less than an hour ago. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 19:32:26
This is the [second]( time I have spotted a BTC sign on ESPN. Guess I am the only one watching Game Day on Saturday. War Eagle!!
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:39:41
There was about 7 people, including myself, there tonight. The ATM is from [BitAccess]( It was just delivered recently, and is supposed to be up and running in the next few days. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:45:30
@_date: 2014-09-27 22:07:20
Yeah, but he gave the majority of it to Sean's Outpost. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 14:26:50
They are, just not for long. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:03:13
Have not read a Clancy novel in a while. Gonna have to grab that one.
@_date: 2019-11-10 15:54:45
I posted the link back then. Actually got a little BTC myself. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:23:57
edit: and its gone. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:36:48
Thanks for being open and honest. Need more mods like you. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:34:46
I did not sign up for this. Go ahead and ban me here and bitcointalk. Not really much use for an "open discussion" if no one can have their own opinion. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:28:55
I was trying to find the article again and was curious why it was not on the front page. Stay classy mods. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 13:58:17
And not start a fire. Those Neptunes can get quite toasty. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 16:22:08
When I found one a couple of years ago, somebody was nice enough to blow it up so it was scannable. Whomever made the sign, when I found it, got a fair amount of BTC. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:58:57
Whenever I sell BTC and money shows up in my bank account, it is money to me. My accountant basically told me he does not count it as income, yet. Should be interesting and terrifying if the government ever taxes BTC.
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:55:16
They are only here to piss people off. Downvote the asshat and move on. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 02:47:20
I see at least 4 BTC shirts I want. You do good work. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:55:40
Block 346879 is gonna be big. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:08:31
Great to hear. Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:12:06
Alabama is not on there. What do you need in order to service my state?
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:34:01
I will be in Atlanta yelling War Eagle!! Can't wait for the game. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 01:25:20
Now BFL is removing my links to the [original post]( on reddit. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 22:44:31
What was your pay date? 
@_date: 2013-09-16 03:20:32
Upvote this man!!
edit: Since I linked this article on the BFL forum I have been [banned](
@_date: 2013-09-16 16:27:55
I only posted this screenshot here and on the bitcointalk forum. If I log back into my BFL account the ban screen pops up and I am directed to the bitcointalk forum. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:04:31
Also BFL_Jonathon has stated that manners' order was not a valid order  Manners and I spoke on the phone today, and he was kind enough to let me into his account. [Here]( is the screen cap from his account. That order looks pretty real to me. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:10:28
War Eagle!! 
@_date: 2013-09-16 02:22:53
All my subsequent posts have been removed by BFL as well. I can still view the locked thread on bitcointalk 
@_date: 2013-09-16 06:59:29
He has opened a new [thread]( now.
@_date: 2013-09-17 02:45:35
@_date: 2013-09-16 12:39:31
edit: [Here]( is the reddit link. 
@_date: 2013-09-14 16:21:41
Did any thing ever happen with the tracking info? 
@_date: 2013-09-15 23:30:14
Since I only have jalapeńo orders, I am already screwed. So I could give a shit about my place in line. 
@_date: 2013-09-23 15:20:44
Why not use Coinbase? I get the verification stuff takes time, but for the .44 BTC I currently have there the fee to transfer the money to my bank account is $.70. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:41:31
[Here you go]( 
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:36:20
That is crazy.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:51:06
@_date: 2013-09-16 12:49:08
Yeah, if you paid BTC or did a bank wire transfer you are shit out of luck. I am in the same boat. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:23:36
I cannot believe that one post blew up so much. Pretty cool. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 04:06:24
[Apparently]( I do not know how to communicate like an adult. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:52:43
I cannot believe a pic I took in my pajama's would start all of this. Crazy. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 15:50:50
Trick people? Plenty of people want their money back. There is an entire thread about it [here](
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:54:05
I thought it was just as funny as it was genius. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 21:47:14
I spoke to him on the phone today, and he gave me permission to use the photo. If you look at the photos OP himself posted, his name is in there. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 14:18:07
Nope. I posted one link to reddit and when it was removed I asked a why it was removed. [Here]( are the screenshots. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:19:39
Somebody else just posted the BFL Refund reddit link and it was immediately removed. Keep us posted on what happens with your order. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:13:21
Nice work!
