I've liked Coinbase Exchange for getting better overall rates. Their "taker" fee is 0.25% and their maker fee is 0%, with a spread of usually a few pennies per bitcoin.

I get where you are coming from, but in one respect we already rely on this (and it's not necessarily a bad thing). As I understand it, pooled mining has close to infinite economies of scale, where there is no direct financial benefit to having more than one mining pool. BUT, there is at least one enormous indirect benefit to having multiple competing pools: a miners' income correlates with faith in the currency. Since a single entity doesn't have control over the transactions included in blocks (and double-spending). I suspect a rational market puts far more faith in a currency that doesn't exhibit this type of structure: the price is the "check and balance" against arbitrary control by a single actor.
I think the same effect would mitigate the mining pool centralization aspect of larger blocks. Even if it increases the cost of running a pool, which may result in marginally fewer pools, the loss of market faith that comes with a critically small number of pools (or individual pools with a majority of the hashing power) would likely outweigh the benefit of reaching dangerous levels of centralization.

@_date: 2015-06-15 02:58:30
I agree with the general sentiment, but I think the key difference is the absence of market power. [So far, miners are free to join or leave pools without huge costs.]
Without market power/the power to exclude other producers, miners have little incentive individually to promote smaller block sizes. [Assuming fee-dominated blocks.] 
[aside from security and centralization ramifications], a small block size is a way to theoretically subsidize difficulty (at the fixed number of transactions) by pushing up the transaction fee and encouraging more hashing investment. But, this fee is not captured by the current pool of miners; rather, it is captured by the pool of miners that has been induced to mine at the higher difficulty. If the same degree of equilibrium is assumed at each point, the miners of today would be no more profitable than the miners of tomorrow (individually), but there would just be more miners tomorrow.

[On the Art.

Primarily to preserve privacy. The QR code in this thread contains the public address (derived from the public key) for the transaction between OP and the merchant. Since the blockchain is a public ledger, this transaction is completely visible (via services that let you search by transaction). From the public address and the context within this post, you can determine the time (&amp; maybe place) of the transaction, which of the transaction outputs is a going to a [change address]( and potentially the identities of the parties to the transaction (or at least would permit narrowing of potential address holders).
The bottom line is that you probably don't want to link addresses to your personal identity, or reveal which address is a change address. Publicizing even a public address of the merchant in a transaction could accomplish both of these. Bitcoin is less anonymous than cash, but precautions can make it pretty close.

is correct, but for the other part of your question:
If bitcoins are "lost," (e.g., sent to an irretrievable address), then they are gone forever, yes. 
But there is no chance of running out of bitcoins, since bitcoins are highly divisible (which can be increased if we ever get there) and the price mechanism will cause each Bitcoin to accrue more value in proportion to the amount of Bitcoins lost (essentially).
[If this destruction/loss happens enough to become a substantial problem, Bitcoin will trade at a discount b/c it would have lost its ability to store value more securely than alternatives.]
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:19:23
But if you do this: 
* You are storing 50% of a company's *revenue* in an asset that cannot be used to pay off normal expenses. All businesses have costs (inventory, salaries, rent, debt repayment, utilities, taxes, etc.) that cannot be paid in BTC. [Maybe salaries, and other things long-term, but not presently.]
* Most (small/mid-sized) businesses don't want to directly speculate with their assets. They aren't investment companies. A company sitting on a large portion of its capital (in the form of BTC) is being inefficient &amp; taking unnecessary risk.
Once you can use BTC to actually pay business expenses and enter into contracts, this will change. But until then, instant conversion to domestic currency is superior for a typical business that isn't sitting on a ton of cash. [BTC might be able to serve as an investment vehicle if you're looking for something to store this surplus cash, but otherwise it isn't better than reinvesting in the business itself.]
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:27:37
Nit-picky, but if you want feedback . . . Holding BTC (or gold) also not technically investing, since you aren't obtaining profit from capital, only on the appreciation of an asset.[Investopedia Definition](

You can conceptualize it as a tax (I prefer service fee, since payment is directly to the miner that includes your transaction in a block). 
The amount that many wallets use a a default is 0.0001-2 BTC (0.1-2 mBTC or 100-200 bits) (3-6 cents). You don't have to change this default unless transactions start taking a long time to confirm. (A block is mined about every 10 minutes. If your transaction isn't being included in subsequent blocks, your fee might be too low.)

But this point is actually a falacy. If someone is using BTC at a merchant, that person is "selling" his/her BTC, creating selling pressure when the merchant exchanges back to usd, sure.
However, this is all based all on the premise that the "BTC user" does not replenish his/her supply. Assuming that users do this, merchant adoption has no intrinsic donward effect on the price of BTC.

Real "take-home" income may have peaked at that time, but overall compensation now includes lots of additional "benefits" that were not popular in 1960. (e.g., healthcare, etc.)
Also, CPI is terrible in that it fails to accurately account for technology and improvements in quality.
The real tragedy is that the inflationary dollar leads the public to think about the past nostalgically. (e.g., the $0.70 gas/gal) A stable currency would help people realize that we are actually getting richer compared to the past, not poorer.

I've been theorizing about the role that banking will play in a Bitcoin-centric economy. Fractional reserve banking is likely still possible (but will pay appropriately higher rates on deposits since physical security isn't an issue), so the "money supply" will not be constructed to M0 (closest approximation of total bitcoins on the blockchain).
It seems that nothing would prevent a central bank from using open market operations to adjust treasury rates &amp; affect the "interest rate." (Assuming the government is still financially trusted, people keep paying taxes, and it's all done off the blockchain.)
It looks like expanding the monetary base won't be an option, but a central bank could still have some effect tinkering in the economy (albeit diminished b/c it cannot inflate away debt). Are there any major issues I'm missing?

Changetip has blown up over the past couple days, after a few threads giving out coins got 5000+ comments. [Unless something else instigated it.]

Looking historically, values of a currency's largest unit have represented huge amounts of economic activity. The purchasing power of a British 
Pound in 1270 and its fraction of the British economy at the time ranges from [800-250,000 in 2013 pounds](
At this time, a pound was divisible into 20 shillings, 240 pennies, and 960 farthings. As long as you can break the currency down into small enough pieces, the size of the 'largest unit' doesn't really matter. (Or probably the fact that it is fiat, in this respect.)

DNA &amp; fingerprints are objectively available and unavoidably sloughed off by humans in their day-to-day lives. You lose hundreds of hairs and a million skin cells in a day &amp; touch lots of things, so demanding production seems at least somewhat reasonable. 
Handwriting sounds more like subjective knowledge that should be protected though, but I guess the courts have figured that "your handwriting" is closer to DNA for your own writing than to a piece of knowledge.
There have been some cases about forced decryption of a hard drives, but there isn't a bright-line consensus yet.

The new mining chips using a more efficient architecture (i think they will be down to 14nm, but I could be mistaken) are going to be coming out in the spring, so whatever you buy now will already be behind the curve. This could affect the difficulty as larger miners adapt, etc.
If you plan on mining, please be sure to take into consideration the likelihood that your fraction of overall hashing power could fall very substantially before you have recouped your capital investment. Pure electricity cost is very important, but it isn't the only thing to think about.
If you want to buy a cheap miner (old generation or a little USB miner) to play around with, that it's usually the advice I see given, since it can give you a realistic feel for the likelihood of turning a profit at all.

I'm not sure if it would trigger AML/KYC laws since it would operate quite differently than disposable CCs. 
In the latter, you buy a card in the store and your cash enters the payment system, with the CC company owning you the balance of your card. This balance may then be used within the CC network, and by moving money behind the scenes you don't trigger identity obligations. (Afaik)
In BTC-card, you would be purchasing a claim to actual bitcoins, deliverable whenever you input a scratch-off code online. This transaction might plausibly fall under "transfer of money" since the BTC would be dispersed directly to the customer.
[Another note: Distribution &amp; production costs are probably very high, so it wouldn't surprise me if only a handful of companies supply all those gift cards you see in the store. These economies of scale might substantially hinder a startup from entering.]
If the legal issue is a nonissue, and you can make the logistics cost-effective (e.g, selling at 5-10% above market), it would be a great way to introduce the ecosystem.

2FA everywhere, strong passwords everywhere (via keepass, last pass, 1password, etc.) , and careful browsing habits (I.e., don't download random torrents on the machine you use for BTC w/o knowing the risks, always check URLs, use a strong WPA2 password, use an antivirus program, etc.) are fundamental protective measures that have to be established to prevent many of the "low-hanging fruit" bad experiences.

I'm not sure that's fundamentally a problem though. Centralized actors could still exist in the future, managing BTC investments, etc. Off-chain transactions can work "fine" for these. You don't necessarily need to think of these transactions as undermining the tx fee system in an unsustainable manner, since they can stay off the block chain long term.
These models do have intrinsic centralized security risks, so it might be less preferred, but this is probably far in the future. Consumers aren't that risk averse (yet).

"They don't offer the recourse that consumers expect from using cash . . . ."
Bitcoin gives consumers *at least* the same legal recourse as cash does, and likely more. Every transaction for goods in the US (aside from those in Louisiana) contains implied warranties of "merchantability" and of "fitness for a particular purpose". Credit card companies have tricked consumers into thinking that a chargeback is their only recourse, when it actually represents only an abbreviation of pre-existing legal rights (which has the benefit of reducing transaction costs, but is hardly the panacea that the CD companies would have you believe). 
Bitcoin's ledger can even provide a greater degree of consumer protections than CCs or cash, in that the blockchain is  immutable and serves as absolute proof (after a # of subsequent blocks) that the transaction occurred between the parties. Credit cards, and certainly cash, cannot provide this level of certainty without trust (perhaps misplaced).
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:57:44
I agree that there is too much hesitance to accept valid transactions. The cost of making a successful fraudulent transaction is very high compared to the value of the vast majority of transactions.
However, the distribution of hashing power among pools might be another factor to include, since waiting for confirms is based on the statistical likelihood of fraudulent blocks being propagated by a dishonest miner. (The 6-confirm baseline included an assumption that might no longer hold: that wrongdoer couldn't obtain more than 10% hashing power, which didn't seem to take into account mining pools of 20 or 30%+.)

The original type of bank probably wouldn't be able to compete in today's market, since it would charge negative interest rates and deposits (in the US) are 'insured' against bank failure, so there is not a direct risk to depositors when using any given bank.

Fundamentally, I would argue that merchant adoption through intermediaries has no (i.e., a negligible direct) effect on price. If merchants adopt BTC by reselling the coins instantly, they are not "demanding" coins in a way that would cause a price increase.
And if Bitcoin users turn around after using the coins with a merchant (I.e., selling them) and rebuy on an exchange, the selling pressure and buying pressure from that transaction essentially cancel each other out. [I imagine this is the general practice, but have no evidence. A survey would be helpful.]
Merchant adoption (unless they actually hold the coins, which is potentially dangerous for any business, since it locks up cash) is most likely neutral on the price if they use intermediaries.
There are second order effects that increase BTC's attractiveness the more places you can use it, making consumer holdings more valuable. These appear to be small compared to inflation and other selling pressure, but disentangling the particular effects isn't very feasible.

I suppose the best way is to give people exposure, even if it's less than the amount to cover a single transaction. 
When first buying BTC, I assume most people purchase a very small amount to play around with &amp; become familiar with the technology. (I bought $0.50 to send around &amp; make sure I understood the simple concepts.)
Changetip can serve this role, making it easier by skipping the first step. Purchasing coins has barriers, even if they aren't too high (for some people they are).
Imo, suggesting a tip of $0.50-$1.00 is extremely restrictive. The tipping thread yesterday had 5000+ comments and thousands of tips. 
Bitcoin faucets worked to provide people with their first coins, but quickly became overwhelmed by bots, etc. Tipping via changetip is serves the same purpose but is much less abusable, and gives people a personal connection to ask questions and find help.

If all the coins were sold by miners, then $525 million+ (based on selling price) was paid to miners, yes. However, It's not really possible to confirm this. 
If mining costs (mining unit+electricity+labor) are less than the market price of the of bitcoins mined, then a miner has surplus income to invest/use. If the miner chose to keep the income in the form of bitcoins, it is possible that the $525 m. number overestimates the amount paid to miners since last year.

The "vault" is a big improvement over normal web storage, but it is still vulnerable to more attack vectors than a strong self-managed cold storage solution.
This might be overly thorough for just staring out, but it would give you a very high level of security. (There are some ridiculous additional precautions, but they are a pain in the ass to deal with.)
Electrum Cold Storage Step-by-Step-guide-
1: The GNU/Linux distro Trisquel now includes Electrum in its default DVD image. You can just download and burn it to a DVD.
2: Remove network cable, or just don't connect to wifi. Then boot Trisquel and start Electrum. Then write down the 12 word seed on a piece of paper
3: Export the master public key and save it to an USB drive
4: Create a m-of-n SSSS-split with previously saved  on an USB drive, like a 2-of-3 split
5: Print out the codes of the 3 splits.
6: Remember the 12 word seed. Make it something like a prayer in hour head you tell yourself every day 3 times
7: Once you are confident, that you remembered the 12 words, destroy the single piece of paper with the seed on it
8: Place the splits in trustworthy places. For example, one for your mother, one to a friend, one to your lawyer.
9: Import the master public key into an Electrum installation of an online device. You can now see only the addresses and send your funds to them.
To access those funds:
1: create a transaction in the online, public key only installation of Electrum
2: save it to an USB drive
3: boot up Trisquel again and restore from seed
4: load the unsigned transaction from the USB drive
5: sign the transaction
6: save the signed transaction to the USB drive
7: load the signed transaction into the online installation of Electrum and broadcast it. Done.

Not answering the "justified" question per se b/c that's more based on subjective value, utility, expectations, etc. But a lower price has ramifications for the network as a whole:
Lower btc price = lower intrinsic block reward = less incentive for mining = fewer miners, since many would cut their losses as their variable costs began to exceed their mining income = lower blockchain difficulty = less security &amp; greater likelihood of attacks = lower price as capital flees to safer assets
Transaction fees could likely rise some in the interim, but the major pools would need to have a fairly effective cartel to make this happen to a great degree.
@_date: 2014-08-23 16:06:53
I guess it would depend on how deposits are stored. If they are individually stored on block chain addresses, you are correct. But if the deposits are stored on paper (figuratively), then the bank can just say you have 1 BTC in your account and not literally mean that there's an address with your name on it that contains 1 BTC. This is basically how it's done today. Money is pooled and used to fund larger projects.
The same could be done with BTCs. The bank would just recognize that it owes depositors a certain amount of BTC rather than fiat. Transactions might be more automated, allowing easy withdrawal to a block chain address (and easier bank runs), but the concept of leverage could still exist.

Setting aside my skepticism of the assertion that cheaper capital automatically creates an overinvestment in capital . . .
I don't see why fractional reserve banking (FRB) wouldn't continue to occur under a bitcoin banking regime. Off chain transactions could easily facilitate this financial technique. Banks don't literally print money, it's just held electronically. 
My theory is that consumers *demand* fractional reserve banking (in the aggregate sense of the term). Consumers want to be paid for allowing banks to lend out their demand deposits. If they wanted to pay for banking, one would expect this option to be available. Btc detaches the "physical security" aspect of banking from the FRB aspect of lending out the money, so the transparency of this future scenario will probably have less of the "fraudulent" aire that comes when consumers are unaware of the practice.
Luckily this is also something that is objectively falsifiable. I look forward to finding out if this intuition is correct if (/when) btc banking takes hold.

A few reasons I can think of:
* There are enough nodes without a reward [Edit: So far]
* There isn't a good way to create the right incentives with a node reward (people would potentially run node server farms if lucrative enough, providing little additional benefit to a decentralized ledger)
* There isn't as much marginal benefit to having additional nodes. Each miner helps increase the difficulty, securing the network. Each node helps process transactions, but there isn't a need for more nodes just for the sake of more nodes.

I have trouble forming a concrete opinion (positive or negative) on this issue. With the efficiency of ASIC miners increasing, alternate sources/prices of energy in the future, and unknown adoption rates, it isn't feasible to make an accurate prediction either way.
The subsidy per transaction is [around $20 right now]( which is probably not sustainable in the long run, yes. However (unless I misunderstand mining) the overall transaction process could easily operate with lower hashing power. Therefore, there is an equilibrium level that will be reached where fees will offset these costs, maybe even at a lower aggregate hash-rate than we currently observe. The difficulty in forming an opinion about this issue is that we can't predict when technological breakthroughs will reduce energy costs, what adoption rates will be in 2050, or whether some unknown external factor could undermine bitcoin entirely.
The war of attrition aspect of mining—that if all miners upgrade their rigs &amp; increase their hashing power, all they do is bid up the price for a fixed-size reward—serves the purpose of securing the blockchain and making it more difficult to attack. I worry not that fees will be too high for transactions, but that the blockchain would be vulnerable to external hijacking if the equilibrium is too low. (Which ends up being fundamentally related with your concern.)
A fixed-inflation altcoin might remedy this issue if it does become a problem, but the mining subsidy would always be higher than "necessary."(Which might be a good thing, since you would be subsidizing security rather than only facilitating transactions.)

Apple Pay uses a token system that doesn't give the merchant the CC number directly, but rather a placeholder. This reduces the risk in the event of a merchant being hacked. 
Although the reduction in merchant fees isn't direct, there is a benefit related to fraud prevention, which might help reduce fees in the long run. It's "sexy tech" and not as elegant a solution as Bitcoin, but saying it does nothing isn't entirely accurate. 
[Apple takes a cut of the transaction, sure, but that doesn't add directly to the merchant's burden, so it's too early to tell if CCs/banks will pass this cost on to the merchant long-term.]

This is based on the underlying assumption that the buyer is not repurchasing the bitcoins. Assuming that this occurs, no selling pressure occurs and the markets remain flat, even with 100% merchant adoption through liquidation intermediaries. (e.g., Bitpay &amp; Coinbase)
The merchant adoption does, however, help spur the value of BTC as a medium of exchange, which would lead to an increase in price.

You're right. As adoption grows, the strength of wallet providers in setting the default tx fee also grows, since many users won't understand the infrastructure (they want something that "just works").

At least on this aspect, I think there is huge potential for innovation. If a company's transactions are conducted on the pseudoanonymous public ledger, or even on private sidechains within a company, "cooking the books" could become nigh-impossible. This aspect of traditional agency cost can be substantially reduced, eliminating expensive frictions and vitiating opportunities for financial fraud to take place. 
The transparency aspect is also applicable to government, but to a lesser extent. With well over 95% [of the US federal budget] public anyway, the incremental accountability might prevent some of the most duplicitous activity, but might not have such a large effect.
There will still be governments, banks, a lack of pure democracy (most are republics), corruption, and power.

Yes, it absolutely adds risk that consumers don't have any incentive to care about (since they are insured), so there are agency cost and moral hazard concerns about the current system. But, it serves the important purpose of utilizing underused capital and pays capital-providers what is required to attract capital (i.e., ~0.5% interest is enough).
If btc replaces the most liquid forms of demand deposits (e.g., free checking, debit card-type banking), fractional reserve banking would still have a reason to exist (capital allocation). But consumers would need a greater incentive to allow it to occur, since the physical security aspect of banks would be nearly irrelevant due to competition from cryptocurrency holdings.

There's no need to secure your BTC, so you might be right in that traditional banks will no longer play this role. (And you don't have to fight against inflation.)

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "come directly into," but it did not "cost" $525 million to produce $525 million of coins.
Price isn't subject to the law of conservation, but rather supply &amp; demand, so it wouldn't necessarily take $525 million to come to the current point. Price is created by buyers &amp; sellers transacting at a point between what they think the thing is worth.
(e.g., Satoshi mines 2 million coins with a market value of $0.00, making a market cap of $0.00. Once a transaction occurs, say 1 BTC for $1, BTC's market cap is now $2 million, even though only $1 "entered the ecosystem.")

The merchant has no demand to hold, so it is tantamount to a consumer selling his/her bitcoins on an exchange directly, yes. However, this selling pressure is nullified by people that rebuy BTC after each transaction.
The merchant only serves as an intermediary between the consumer of goods and a BTC exchange. If we had 100% merchant adoption via coinbase/bitpay, this wouldn't add selling pressure to the market unless the current holders of coins weren't buying the coins back after "selling" them to a merchant.

Art. I, Sec. 8, Clause 5 deals with the coinage and regulation of money.

No, NY has the authority to regulate activities that touch and concern its jurisdiction (e.g., to tax the wages of an employee working in the state, paid by an out-of-state company).
There could be valid legal ground to allege that NY does not have authority to apply bitlicense to all the commerce that passes through a foreign exchange, but it can undoubtedly apply the license to interactions that the exchange has with citizens of NY. [Mass-banning IPs of NYers would be an attempt to avoid this rule, but that might not be enough, depending on the circumstances.]

Actually a pretty interesting constitutional argument. There are several SCOTUS cases that discuss the "exclusive" power to coin money, but there don't seem to be any precedents directly on point (though I could have missed one). There's a 2014 NC district court decision, but it deals with private tangible currency.
The dicta of previous decisions appear to be conclusive on this point, but I believe that exclusivity is not a necessary conclusion based on the language used, based on several factors. (i.e., contemplation of "Foreign coin;" the "exclusive" language used in the Articles of Confederation but not the Constitution; the structure Section 8; ban on State coinage of money in Section 10, etc.)
In any manner, if Bitcoins are 'created' (discovered / authorized?) by mining, a finding that Bitcoin creation is unconstitutional in the United States might not be a complete death-knell. The only current remedy for the creation of Bitcoins appears to be an injunction, since Bitcoins are (probably) not covered under current couterfieting laws. This would technically make Bitcoin a "Foreign Coin," since it is 'created' entirely outside the United States. However, whether it would then fulfill the Constitutional definition of "Foreign Coin" is potentially an issue . . .

It's an interesting thought experiment, but I still think the conclusion is wrong for a few reasons:
* A botched hard fork could have little if any effect on price, unless there exists substantial expectations that a fix would be coming. Users could revert to a previous incompatible version of the "fix" is worse.
* Miners do not operate as a single unit, and would cease mining at different times, dampening the hashing fall, depending on their marginal prices &amp; any hedging efforts they have taken.
* Miners &amp; node operators have a greater incentive to adopt any fix than to languish in this catastrophic hash crash, I doubt they would be hesitant to adopt something that could revive the value of their investments 
* A preventative fork could likely occur before any of this 99% crash could happen.

In something as as liquid as Bitcoin, I'm skeptical that someone can buy (or sell) enough to spike (or tank) the price high enough (or low enough) to cash out at the top (or bottom). The market doesn't just cascade in either direction. I would be interested to see some data / research characterizing this phenomenon.

Good post, thanks for getting people thinking about the actual systemic issues rather than short-lived growing pains. But I think saying you have no customer protection is a little but of an overstatement. You have at least the same recourse as paying in cash, with the benefit of an immutable ledger that proves your transaction occurred.
The "too anonymous" point does illustrate the danger of this though. You can't spend cash instantly halfway around the world, and would have virtually no recourse when doing so. Institutions will have to develop to remedy this trust problem, else there is "money left on the table," so to speak. 
Luckily this creates a pretty strong incentive for independent arbitration companies to spring up, serving the role a CC company's chargeback process. But since the payment mechanism (bitcoin via multisig) is independent from the arbitration service, the consumer should be able to capture more of this value compared to the oligopoly that currently exists.

"Safe enough" is probably relative. I wouldn't use it to store my life savings, but keeping some spending money on Coinbase can be convenient. Even though Coinbase has insurance and Vault prevents withdrawals by a delay mechanism, there is inherent risk &amp; it could be a hassle if something goes wrong.
I currently use Armory offline for my primary storage (via a similar setup), but the implementation I listed is a more elegant solution. (I got it from another poster.)
I plan on moving to electrum soon though. I might skip the passguardian portion for the password, and rather preserve the 12-word seed in a secure location with redundancy, but I'm still thinking about how I want to do that part.
(Memorization is dangerous to rely on. If you are injured you could lose your health and all your Bitcoins, so it just seems like an unnecessary centralization of risk to me.)
If you want to just experiment with offline transactions you can skip everything else and just run a Trisquel LiveCD (never connecting to the Internet) to practice signing &amp; transferring transactions. [recommended to build familiarity &amp; confidence]

* bitcoin-related services (rising popularity of Changetip and increasing numbers of remittance &amp; payment processors around the world)
* 3rd party Cellphone-based payment systems, teaching the consumer to trust payment-by-phone (makes BTC transition easier)
* diversity &amp; competition between wallets &amp; services (distribute risk, indicates interested developers)
* exponential growth in VC interest (they aren't investing for charity)
* public identification (even if it's only name-recognition, but things like [this iOS tap-game]( help give BTC a playful image, rather than news stories that propagate BTC's association with things the public considers shady)

The main reason is unrelated to the programs themselves. Electrum is installed by default in Trisquel distributions, making it extremely easy to simulate an airgapped computer via LiveCD. I could be wrong, but I don't think any linux distributions include Armory by default, necessitating either a persistent LiveUSB or LiveCD + Armory on a USB drive for the same degree of security.
As long as you keep networking turned off and your kernel / USB drives are secure, there is only the risk of physical access. 
Armory's ability to generate x-of-y recovery seeds would let you skip a step compared to electrum and obtain the same degree of physical security, but it would add steps compared to running the program that is pre-installed with the OS.
Another drawback of Armory is that it requires a fully-downloaded blockchain on your hot computer, which many users find to be a hassle.

Buffett's use of "value" and "intrinsic value" really muddles the whole discussion. His statement is a tautology that illustrates an investment philosophy rather than a particular reason to avoid bitcoin. Btc won't generate cashflows and thus isn't a technical investment, but this just means that btc the currency has no productive value (independent ability to generate more wealth). But the "value" of its improvements on traditional payment methods is hard to ignore.
To use Buffett's example, imagine a limited supply (whether mildly inflationary, deflationary or fixed) checks that could be used to store and transfer wealth (or even that someone has a patent on the the business method of using checks in this manner). These checks would have a market value derived from their usefulness at performing this function, even though they are devoid of intrinsic value, just like any other currency that isn't inflated infinitly. (E.g., (Reductio ad absurdum)If the US treasury printed $1 quadrillion tomorrow, the "value" of a $1 bill would be the same as a blank check, no more than the "value" of the paper and ink used in its creation and whatever other uses it would have.)

By pegging, do you mean fixed conversion rate between btc and RNs?(XBTXRN?) If you peg to bitcoin, what would be the difference from holding bitcoin itself?
My first impression was that RNs would have a market exchange rate like btc and other assets, and (somehow) derive value from actual shares.
But the intentional vagueness of 'backed by stock but not backed by stock's could just mean that they are trying to figure out a solution that doesn't draw the ire of the SEC.  The release is still 9+ months away, so they probably don't have answers to  structural questions yet. It's certainly fun to theorize about though.

Sure, just buy enough BTC for $350 (you might want to buy $370 to be safe), and then sell back the remainder to coinbase when you're through.
Coinbase.com is probably the easiest to use for buying/selling starting out.

Coinbase is reputable as a payment processor, Bitcoin market maker &amp; wallet provider. Backed by some big names in VC, it is generally trusted and hasn't indicated any  shady activity is going on.
Circle and Trucoin are also easy ways to buy Bitcoin without having to go through the whole exchange process. (Credit/debit/ACH bank transfers accepted)
See the Bitcoin FAQ for some general answers.
Don't buy 1 BTC all at once until you understand how to transact, etc. Sending a couple hundred dollars to the wrong address would be really painful.

I can answer a few of the questions, but initially my thought is that your solution might be overkill. Is there a reason you are using electrum and armory and Trezor and independent paper wallets? Those are usually replacements rather than supplements to each other. Choosing one cold storage solution and using redundant backup methods should be just as secure and much easier to manage.
Moving on to some of your inquiries:
* SD cards still have [low-level vulnerabilities]( so being 100% safe while transferring transactions between computers isn't feasible quite yet via USB/SD. (Maybe CD-R burning would be the safest right now?) Personally, I think these vulnerabilities are close enough to 0 to ignore, compared to events far more likely to occur, like getting struck by a car, or lightning.
* If the file is encrypted with a strong enough password, a brute force attack should take many lifetimes. 4 or 5 random words is typically enough, but there's a lot of literature on password strength out there 
* If making an m-of-n backup, I often see people giving them to attorneys, giving them to trusted relatives, keeping them in home safes, and keeping them in safe deposit boxes, so there is no single point of failure.
* Don't rely on your brain as a single point of failure, unless you recognize that the chances of losing all your coins in the event of a head injury are relatively high compared to the incremental security benefit.

Apple pay:
* Uses credit cards, very easy to set up, but is the traditional "pull mechanism" of payment
* Gives merchants a token representing your card, rather than the CC# itself, so even if their systems are compromised, you do not have a risk of fraudulent charges on other sites, etc.
* Retains the usual merchant fee system (with Apple's % cut coming from the CC &amp; Bank's side, rather than being passed to the merchant directly, afaik)
* Limited to US Apple customers [so far]
* NFC-based physical payments &amp; In-App purchases
Bitcoin: 
* "Push mechanism" of payment, so you control exactly what is transferred to the recipient
* Slightly less user-friendly to set up, general computer virus/keylogger vulnerabilities &amp; opportunities for the user to accidentally lose money [so far, but tutorials &amp; storage solutions are improving]
* Disputing transactions is more of a hassle than with CCs, since you often have to rely on the legacy legal system [This could be remedied with multi-signature escrow transactions in the future, but there are few current options.]
* Usually QR-code based; essentially requires internet connectivity on both sender &amp; receiver devices for confirmation, but proof-of-concept NFC transactions have been demonstrated

Oh, I noticed another couple factors I missed. In a BTC economy, it would serve as the world reserve currency. There could be some negative ramifications from this:
* creates a greater impetus for global cooperation between central banks, perhaps consolidation. I'm not sure if this would be a slippery slope scenario, though.
* if BTC is used as the reserve, with countries creating their own crypto-fiat currencies, could it play the role that gold played in the late 1920s? With more liquid capital markets, maybe it isn't realistic today, but France's hoarding of gold is believed to have contributed to the global financial crisis by causing deflation in other gold-based countries around the world.

Accounting/Auditing - [theorizing] Due diligence &amp; auditing could become incredibly efficient, with accounting software that incorporates blockchain transaction tracking. Fraud could be substantially more difficult to hide.
Banking - physical security of currency will be substantially less of a role (it's barely a role with universal FDIC), so 0% interest demand deposits will likely disappear. But banks will still be able to utilize fractional banking, assuming they don't literally store depositors' bitcoins in discrete addresses for each user (I.e., they don't store 100% reserves).
B2B - instant payment could turn receivables into cash, but contracts will probably still allow for future payment. BTC can reduce the risk of transacting via Multisig &amp; reduce frictions related to transferring large amounts of money. Transferring any amount of Bitcoin for $0.03 or less is feasible.

Unless the mining pool can make a double-spend attack large enough to pay off all the miners, the incentives are aligned in not making the price of Bitcoin go to near-zero.

It depends on your definition of "manipulation," really. The way zero-hedge uses it is pretty ambiguous and all-encompassing.
Distributed systems ideally have negligible barriers to entry, so the market can punish any attempts to "manipulate" the market. (E.g., the bearwhale's sell wall didn't independently push the price down enough for the whale to make a profit by "scooping up cheap coins.") (I would argue that the whale's efforts could not achieve this goal in a well-functioning liquid market.)

It doesn't have to be a scam, so long as it satisfies the definition of "investment contract," "whether the scheme involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others." If the definition is satisfied, the instrument (i.e., cloud mining agreement) is deemed to be a security under US law, and subject to SEC regulation.
There's probably a good argument to be made that it fails the "investment of money" and "profits solely from the efforts of others" portions of the test, but it could still be risky to litigate.
Hopefully (1) the SEC decides it isn't worth pursuing, or (2) this letter is fake.
@_date: 2014-12-29 15:25:59
They are essentially offloading the volatility risk of btc to people who "purchase cloud mining." I would guess that their fee structure is such that they would still make money if BTC crashed, and turn into a pure mining company if BTC skyrockets.

* ExchangeTradedNote - a "note" (debt instrument) denominated in BTC that will pay ~~a certain amount of BTC~~ (edit:as noted below) out based on the BTC-USD exchange rate on a later date (edit: i.e., the redemption date chosen by the issuer / holder). This should allow for more arbitrage &amp; greater access by financial institutions and the investing public to BTC. [This differs from the COIN ETF in that it is directly related to the credit of the issuer, rather than tied to the underlying BTC asset.]
* GBTC - a share representing 0.1 BTC, sold only to accredited investors &amp; cannot be sold for 1 year. This allows for some exposure, but presents barriers to arbitrage &amp; results in a dampened market effect.
I'm not sure how accessible the ETN will be to investors outside of Sweden or the EU generally, but I would expect it to track the actual BTC price more closely and represent a "better deal" than GBTC to most investors.

This is based on the assumption that you're not buying the coins back on an exchange. If you don't buy the coins back, it's tantamount to selling your BTC on the exchange directly.

"Store credit" means that you can be paid in "cost of goods sold" rather than in cash, thereby locking in a future sale and allowing Newegg to make the profit from the transaction up front.
Even if btc were the dominant currency, you would still be given a store credit from most places because it is so economical for the business and people are willing to accept the ease of returns for such credits. Btc lowers the cost of refunding via 'cash', but it doesn't change the underlying reason why a credit is more favorable. As long as consumers tolerate the practice, and it helps the business compete on prices, it probably won't be going away.

If supply was permanently greater than demand, the price would continually fall. 
Selling coins through bitpay can lower the price if holders are not replenishing their holdings.

I'm not sold on it being very viable, but I'm willing to throw you a few thoughts. It might be viable long-term if users have a huge amount of freedom to mix &amp; match the modules.
Potential thoughts:
* Inexpensive standard model with barebones features
* Consumers can pop in multiple CPU/GPU modules when you want to render 3D graphics (could be hooked up to your TV) or do something CPU-intensive. 
* Adjustable SSD storage modules make it easy to upgrade your phone's internal storage
* When a new wireless standard comes out that your radio doesn't support, you don't have to upgrade everything to have access.
* The current 2-year (or 1-year) upgrade cycle is very attractive to people that want "the new thing"
* Why would phone companies want to destroy such a revenue stream? Are the savings for developing hardware for a standardized platform supposed to outweigh the potential profits of the current model? [And if it isn't standardized, fragmentation could be worse.]

Physical oligopolization is much less likely than pool oligopolization, so I'm skeptical that attacking another individual miner will ever be profitable. [A single farm would need to be providing a substantial fraction of the processing power (10-20%+?) to reap much of a benefit.]

Sticky prices (and wages, to some extent) are partially because changing the price is costly in itself. I imagine this will be solved in the future with electronic price tags that can make price adjustments on the fly. 
The psychological aspect of sticky wages will probably be more difficult to overcome, but with (ideally) a better measure of purchasing power it might be feasible. (Even if they don't adjust, wages could be be slightly artificially lower to account for future expected deflation, causing demand-side shortages. Wages therefore might be artificially high in today's market, causing supply-side shortages.(?))
It's also important to remember that the magnitude of deflation should be very low by the time BTC saturates the market. (Based only on the rate BTCs are lost, which shouldn't be huge.) The deflation while getting there could be psychologically difficult though.
Ultimately, one point I love about a deflationary currency is that long-term prices will actually reflect the improving efficiency of the world and the effect of technology. Inflation misleads people into romanticizing the $0.57/gal gas in 1975 ($2.42 by today's CPI), even when car mpg is up probably 50% since then. (Ignoring the gas rationing.) People think that our standard of living is about double what it was a century ago. Inflation enforces this mentality, despite the actual number of probably 10-30x.

Startups like Coinbase have a lot of funding, so I'm not sure they would be understaffed on the security side of things.

While that's (quite) concerning, the mining [revenue per transaction]( (and difficulty) is already being highly subsidized through the seignorage-based block reward. Transaction fees would need to be around $10 right now to generate the same revenue &amp; incentivize the same level of difficulty. 
If an attack like that were to occur, it might be time to consider switching from sha256 PoW mining.
Edit: This isn't really a rebuttal to the general concern, but I don't think restricting transactions to 1800 trx per block would be sufficient to protect against an attack that sought to spend so many times BTC's market cap.

I think both scenarios will result in the same profit margin by a miner, but under the block-restricted scenario there will be more capital invested in mining and the difficulty will be subsidized compared to the "natural rate" (with no block size restriction). [I'm assuming the natural rate accurately reflects the value that users place on the convenience and security of transacting in bitcoin.]
Since the barrier to entry is relatively low (very limited regulations, essentially only capital / utility / labor / lease costs), I think assuming idealized conditions is justified. I.e., fairly free entry and exit, so that the profit of a miner is "reasonable" given the alternative investments of capital in the economy ("market rate of return"). 
If the number of transactions per block were artificially restricted, the transaction fee would likely rise (assuming the demand to transact in bitcoin continues to rise) and the total revenue that miners receive would likewise increase. This revenue would initially translate into higher per-miner profits, since the whole pie of mining rewards is increasing. But as miners (and market entrants) realize that they are receiving above-market returns, more capital will be invested in mining equipment. This drives up the difficulty and spreads out the mining revenue until the profit of each miner reaches something close to the market rate of return.
So ultimately, a restricted block size would lead to greater investment in mining capital, above what would be necessary at the natural rate. Combined with the deadweight loss associated with the limited transaction capacity, I don't think this over-investment would be socially desirable. The network would be "stronger," but it's impossible to know whether this additional strength is actually worth the cost. [And if it proves not to be worth the cost, transactions will be driven off-chain and/or to alt coins.]
TLDR: A block size limit would result in higher total miner revenue and (potentially unnecessarily) higher difficulty, but not higher per-miner profits. Difficulty inflation isn't an ends in and of itself, so I don't think a restriction on the block size is justified on those grounds. 
Edit: And this is assuming that the block size limit isn't too far up on the demand curve to be affirmatively harmful to revenue.

Yes, currently you can fit around 3 transactions per second into a 1 MB block. This jumps to 60 at 20 MB. Not as much as a CC processor, which deals in thousands and has capacity for tens of thousands, but the plan is to scale up over time.

Right, so under some future Bitcoin banking scheme, fractional reserve banking would still exist.
It involves putting faith in a third party (Edit: assuming no insurance), and thereby assuming some risk in return for payment. But this isn't innately a bad thing, since every investment entails some degree of risk. I wouldn't want my money in a bank leveraged 1000-to-1, but that doesn't mean fractional reserve banking can't be a useful financial technique. However, the possibility of bail-outs does complicate things . . .

To add a point of clarification, there aren't actually any bitcoins; it's all unspent transaction outputs. Once a payment (A) has been made to an address that has coins (B) (e.g., 25A+25B=50C), the output (C) from the transaction is all that remains. Subsequent transactions could be thought of being 50% A and 50% B, but there isn't really a technical distinction there; later outputs are simply parts of C. [You might still want transaction outputs that have been mixed with other outputs the least amount of times, but I hope this helps with understanding the way transactions operate.]
There probably are few if any nonpool miners operating today, but I guess you would ideally be looking for someone who received the coinbase payment and simply never combined the coins with any other holdings. That might be difficult, but maybe some people deliberately kept their coins "separate" because they could receive above-market prices.
@_date: 2014-10-11 15:17:40
Yes, I was wrong to ignore the currently subsidized mining market. The VC funding as a subsidy is probably more arguable. It is possible for Coinbase/Bitpay to be using "promotional rates," but it's just speculation without seeing their finances. VCs want a return, it isn't charity (usually).
I guess I'm optimistic that transaction volume will rise quickly enough to maintain low rates. We aren't at the marginal cost of mining yet, unless a lot of miners are mining at a loss, so there's still a lot of uncertainty about the future of transaction rates.

Falkvinge appears to be wrong under the current law of [personal jurisdiction]( A corporation transacting with a NY resident online is most likely subject to the laws of NY, taking into account the business's contacts with the state.

If the block size is still limited and gradually increases, it should remain accessible for non-government entities to mine / run nodes.

Bitcoin could replace credit for the ~ 50% of US cardholders that pay off their bill in full every month (using a CC like a debit card), but credit could still be useful for those that run balances (though I wonder about the CC businesses model if the aforementioned 50% leave the CC ecosystem). [These numbers differ substantially in the EU.]
(Btc can also supplant debit cards / checking in the same manner.)
CCs would potentially still be useful for particular types of purchases:recurring bills and subscriptions, to reduce the number of monthly bills consumers have to worry about. 
Theoretically, CC companies serve two main purposes: (1) moving money and (2) private dispute resolution. Bitcoin could replace (1), but there might still be room for escrow services of some kind to minimize fraud, etc. under (2). Multisig is great, but I think you still need a third party to judge objectively whether the transaction is complete. CC companies may have to shift to this model in the future.

I would say the Network effect means that a single network is greater than the sum of its parts, by being far more efficient than many fragmented independent networks. Each of the smaller networks (altcoins) would need to build up the notoriety with the general public, which could be hard to do &amp; become confusing to non-tech-savvy users. This is why a single coin will rise, but not necessarily why bitcoin will be that coin.
Bitcoin is the crypto with the best chance to succeed because it benefits from "first mover's advantage,"(and thereby has: larger install base, the most recognition, far more hashing power, etc.), not merely because cryptocurrencies have a general "network effect."
I would guess that most people that have heard of bitcoin don't even know that altcoins exist (and even greater portion of you remove Ltc, doge &amp; ripple). That's a pretty big head start &amp; a major hurdle for any alt to have widespread adoption. Not insurmountable, but pretty unlikely unless some unforkable flaw is found in btc.

Safe, yes, but it might reduce privacy. Each address you create (or could create) with a deterministic wallet is forever connected to that wallet, based on the randomized seed.
On the privacy side, it would enable someone to potentially use blockchain forensics to link the connection to you personally. Unique addresses for each transaction make this a lot more difficult.
Addresses are essentially designed to be used once, based on the way that change addresses work, to emulate a cash system. Reusing addresses isn't literally unsafe, but it's generally not recommended.

Except "the miners" have no [market power]( the barriers to entry  in mining are very low, so I wouldn't say that individual miners have as much control as you suggest. I would rather characterize it as votes being held by those who demand/use the currency. If a fork occurred tomorrow, miners would presumptively flock to the version that provides them a greater return (the one with the higher price, based on market demand). This demand would be a function of the same factors drive BTC demand today: general expectations for the future (including security, usability, etc.). The aggregate hashing power contributes to security, but predications based on the block size and use by exchanges / services are important as well.
And since miners don't seem to be a very effective [cartel]( (and are interested in profit, currently almost entirely tied to the BTC price), I think the other contributors to the "consensus" have a larger effect.

The approval process is actually not that strenuous for selling securities, your registration automatically becomes effective 20 days after the filing unless a delaying amendment is included(which is always the case).
 It takes so long because you actually want the SEC feedback, to make your filling perfect (to avoid liability for misstatements). You also want to make sure the market is right for the IPO. The Winklevosses don't want to just dump coins, they might want to wait for a more favorable price.

Theoretically (strong efficient capital market), nothing, since the market should incorporate this information already.
In actuality you really can't predict the effect on price. It could go up as the supply of btc injected into the economy decreases, our or could decrease if people are worried about the future.

If you find an alt that does something better than BTC that cannot be incorporated into the BTC protocol without a huge amount of effort or shift in philosophy, there is a chance of coexistence by each filling a different niche. But if your alt is practically identical to BTC, the likelihood of it taking off and having any value from use/investment/speculation is very low.

A few factors:
* Many payment processors check for transaction propagation across multiple nodes, verifying that the coins are not being double-spent. (Single nodes can sometimes be confused, but dispersed consensus world be very difficult to defeat.)
* Mining-related double spend attacks are very expensive too successfully pull off without detection (and become exponentially more expensive every ~ 10 mins), so waiting for multiple confirmations for a small transaction is overkill.
* The 6-confirmation "gold standard" is derived from an acceptable risk of 0.0001%, based on an assumption that a malicious miner does not control more than 10% of all hashing power (which doesn't necessarily hold anymore). This is lower than the degree of risk of an average credit card transaction, so it generally fine.

The economies of scale of a large operation probably aren't that important in mining, since you're going to be in a pool anyway.
The most important factors are cheap electricity &amp; cheap cooling, which come from an efficient rig, low electricity prices, and using the heat to heat a living space.

Good point. Slowly declining is not likely unless the price is falling and kicking off the least profitable miners. Once you have the miner, the price/ reward will have to drop pretty far to justify turning off your machine.
A decline in the increase of the difficulty rate would be more likely to occur, as new entrants consider a halving before entering the mining space in the first place.

I'm not an expert with secured transactions, but the fact that the asset liens have been "perfected" means that the interest is effective against third parties.

There are a lot of cases, but it's really not that precise. This definition is actually notorious for its broad application.
The most applicable definition is for "investment contract," which is defined as an "investment of money due to an expectation of profits arising from a common enterprise which depends solely on the efforts of a promoter or a third party." SEC v. Howey (1946)
A very strong argument could be made that all cloud mining implicates this definition.

By off-chain transactions I mean that they are transactions that take place off the Blockchain (think Coinbase, Circle, Changetip, etc.), not that they are actual sidechains. This would allow a fractional reserve scheme to operate, I.e., buying and selling btc on credit. A central bank could denominate treasury bills in BTC, buying and selling them to "target an interest rate," as happens today. 
There could be some long run macro problems with this system, since the central bank would literally not have the option of printing more tangible currency, but that might not prevent people from trying to control the business cycle. 
I figure the central bank would eventually be global to account for btc's lack ease of transmission internationally. There would be a "network effect" of a single central bank adjusting the interest rate of the world, since many independent central banks would counteract each other, like we saw with gold in the 1920s.
Edit: this structure would test the ability of a central bank to exist on faith, since it might not have global taxing power to ensure solvency &amp; a pristine credit rating. 
This is all very theoretical, but is still an interesting thought experiment. Institutions won't stand still and wait for bitcoin to happen.

I don't know enough about the definition of price manipulation in commodities situations to know whether this is true or not. This [summary]( suggests that "price manipulation" would fall under [CFTC Rule 180.2](


It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to manipulate or attempt to manipulate the price of any swap, or of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity.
However, if a raw $20-price floor were occurring with an equity security after an IPO, it would be an illegal price support under the Securities laws. This analogy isn't perfect, but it gives a taste of how similar transactions are regulated.

Based on the GLD ETF in 2003, this might be the last amendment, or the second to last. I would guess it launches within a couple months, but I could be off.
Based on the filling, the Trust will sell shares to an "initial purchaser" entity in exchange for bitcoins. This entity (which might be the winklevosses) will then go on to sell the shares on NASDAQ at the ~~Windex~~ (edit: Winkdex, autocorrect)  market price. [So it doesn't look like there will be a closed sale portion like in a normal IPO.]
The trust will also issue shares on a continuous basis in exchange for deposits of btc, permitting arbitrage to mediate the prices, etc.
But really the winklevosses have all the discretion in the world at this point. They could technically "go effective" at any time, but have an incentive to really hammer out the particulars &amp; potentially just wait a while. 
Things they could be waiting for or working on:
* More SEC feedback on the filling &amp; general edits.
* For the price to rise, so the ETF's initial sell-off is more profitable.

I fail to see why BTC will solve the problem described in the title. Off-chain transactions allow fractional reserve banking to continue &amp; tinkering with the BTC 'money supply.' 
BTC might make it difficult for a country to drastically devalue its currency over night, but there's still room for central banks' influence.
The same core principle that gives people faith in domestic fiat currencies will mean that countries' central banks can adjust BTC's inflation &amp; deflation rates: confidence in a government's ability to tax its citizens' future productive activity (over a very long time horizon if necessary).

Alt coins with completely different security features, like Darkcoin and Monero, would be impossible to implement on Btc without fundamental changes, so they have an independent raison d'être from bitcoin itself. 
And since they are filling an alternative "need," it is *less likely* that the coin was created to enrich the development team &amp; early adopters. 
It's not a fool-proof check for a "scam" by any means, but asking "why does this coin exist?" can be a good first step to double-check a fishy-looking alt. [This is akin to asking "how does this business make money? does it have a future?" before making an investment.]

There are two options, I think, that a free money supply could pursue: (1) fixed supply / floating value, like bitcoin; or (2) variable supply, with value fixed to a basket of goods. Even though (1) has the potential for deflationary / inflationary cycles, I believe it has fewer sources of error than (2): (2) would require some sort of third party (i.e., trusted oracle) to choose the basket and continually adjust both it and the money supply, accounting for improvements in quality / new technologies as well as demand for the currency. 
Psychologically I'm not sure which is superior [buying more goods with constant money (1), or simply having more money (2)]– but either could turn out "better" depending on how asymmetric human biases are.
[e.g., under (2) I am thinking that the money supply would spontaneously increase, giving users 11 bitcoins for every 10 bitcoins held if monetary demand increases by 10% (much like a stock split). There would be no seignorage.]

Correct. For example, if you got a new phone or computer, all you would have to transfer over is the "recovery seed phrase" to regenerate all the addresses contained in the previous wallet. [Some scanning of the Blockchain may be necessary to ensure accurate balances.]
Each of these deterministic wallets (also called hierarchical deterministic, or HD) can generate a near-infinite number of receiving addresses from this recovery seed, so using a new address for each transaction for the rest of your life (and your heirs' lives, if they want) is feasible as well.

I guess I'm trying to make two points. Even if bitcoin is the only currency in the economy I think they are both true:
1. (Private) banks will still be able to use fractional reserve banking if consumers permit them to do so. [This seems somewhat straightforward, and we've seen how exchanges have tried to do it.]
2. Central banks will still be able to run deficits &amp; use open-market operations, selling/buying treasuries to fund operations &amp; adjust for inflation. [Maybe not both?, but many monetarists thought that the stimulus &amp; fed's balance sheet would cause rampant inflation, so it's unclear.]
The magnitude of btc-wide inflation &amp; of the interest on these treasuries is very hard to predict. The backstop of the printing press generally eliminates the possibility that the US could default on its loans entirely, but BTC would remove this option, leaving bankruptcy as the default. A bail-out of any kind would be entirely faith-based, requiring "tangible" btc or clear fiscal policies that nearly eliminate the likelihood of default by the bailor.
I'm not saying that this scenario couldn't create a sort of virtuous-circle of incentives at the government scale (treasury interest rates based on bankruptcy as the default, rather than the printing of domestic fiat or a bail-out), but I'm skeptical of claims that it will be simple, central banking will disappear entirely, and that power over monetary policy will necessarily be decentralized.

Interesting. I guess allowing it to grow in response would be attractive, but that could hypothetically hit the same problem of growing too fast. 
There might be a way to look at current network propagation and predict the effect of this change. (I.e., Whether the current network existing right now could handle it easily, or if it would make consensus times too long.) (Ignoring for the time being the effect of increased cost to run a node.)

I absolutely agree. The block reward / # of transactions is not the cost of the block, but rather the revenue that miners capture for their efforts, per block. This chart, often cited when making the claim, is labeled incorrectly: 
Calling this number the "cost" ignores the way that markets operate. Yes, this additional BTC increases the money supply and enacts an "inflation tax" on current holders, but it's not as simple as dividing X by Y and calling that "cost." This so-called "cost" is at most the amount of non-BTC money that must demand BTCs for a stable price, and you can't distill the "cost of transactions" from that metric.

GAW was a miner company that turned into a "cloud mining" company that turned into an alt-coin "cloud mining" company. (Unless I misunderstand something.) Throughout this process, it ostensibly possessed a certain number of devices capable of mining btc. If those devices were not mining btc during the "cloud mining" / altcoin mining phases, and just recently focused on the blockchain, that could potentially cause an increase in difficulty.
It's entirely speculation, but it would be an interesting cause to the recent hashing bump.

This is really the key element. Massive inflation &amp; deflation each screw with expectations and can freeze up markets entirely. 
If inflation/deflation is tiny &amp; predictable, it is priced into wages, agreements, and nearly every economic transaction. 
Pure inflation for the sake of inflation (assuming it is already price in everywhere) is essentially transfer payment from the holders of currency to the creators of the currency. I'm not sure it's so clear that taking away a fraction of each person's wealth each year and giving it to another group of people (or central government) actually fosters investment &amp; an increased growth rate. 
The main classical detractor to a deflationary currency is that nominal wages are [theoretically] sticky downward, so employers will under-hire rather than force a future pay cut. People psychologically *hate* taking a wage cut. Empirical examples of this are all in the past, so it isn't clear whether this effect would be mitigated when pricing becomes more fluid (electronic price tags, etc., with adjustments based on market conditions; this would be problematic with the $0.99 marketing), but it might take an evolution of how people think about wages &amp; salaries.
Despite this drawback, I think a slightly deflationary currency [i.e., only from lost coins] still has an incredible benefit. Consumers would be able to observe the world's increasing economic productivity over time. Many lament the weakening of the dollar (sometimes for good reason) and how "cheap" things were in the 70s, 60s, 50s, and beyond. But really, the average first-world habitant has experienced a huge boost in standard of living over the past 50-100 years, partially hidden by inflation, and thereby partly (if only psychologically) unrecognized. I'm uncertain whether a deflationary currency would help individuals recognize the importance of long-term economic growth, by seeing the direct effects of increased productivity over time, but I think it's worth a shot to find out.

Side note: If btc "succeeds," it will get a lot more volatile before it settles down. Paying wages in btc will bring the stability sooner, but it is bound to be a rough ride until you can justify btc-denominated long-term contracts.

Sounds right. Banks borrow short and lend long, making money on the yield spread between short and long-term interest rates. 
[Bitcoin and fractional reserve banking aren't incompatible either. Fractional reserve banking is a series of contract relationships between lenders, intermediaries, and borrowers; its a tool, not some inherent evil. Bitcoin does however have the added bonus that it's a bit harder to bail out institutions because the underlying coins cannot be created spontaneously at a whim.]

The bitcoins themselves will be worth the same, all else being equal, but the cost to move X's bitcoin will be higher. 
I moved 50% of my bitcoins a while ago from a wallet and paid over $1 in fees. The last 50% cost only $0.14. The wallet collected smaller utxo's into the first transaction and larger utxo's into the second transaction, leading to higher fees for the first.
The bigger issue with differential coin pricing is when coins are stolen in a hack or related to online gambling. Because bitcoin wallet addresses can be associated with these events, the coins in those wallets can be "tainted." Theoretically, people could value those tainted coins less than freshly minted coins without this history. 
I don't think this has been very common in the wild, but it is a theoretical possibility.

He has a point about it being a bad currency (for now) due to volatility.
But in the long run, you would want your currency to be controlled by market forces just like the prices of everything else; fixing a currency to a basket of goods may be problematic for a couple of reasons:
1. How do you distribute the seigniorage? To banks? To another class favored by the powerful? To coin holders directly? (The latter doesn't differ from a floating exchange rate, except in perception.)
2. The basket cannot account for technology except by arbitrary guessing. When do you add a car to the basket and remove the buggy whip? When do you add the newest version of the iPhone and remove the older one? 
If bitcoin "succeeds," many believe that the volatility will not be substantial because the market will just be so large. But prior to this success, there is going to be a hell of a lot of volatility.

At this stage of the Bitcoin economy, mining is essentially impossible to be profitable if you have the electricity costs of the US/EU.
Also: "cloud mining" doesn't generally pay off. If it were profitable, the company providing the service would just mine for itself, so the business model doesn't make sense for the consumer.
As an aside, "cloud mining" is probably a security under the US securities laws (and maybe other countries), so it is likely illegal securities trading.

I agree. Additionally, the time to think about changing the policy is when the transaction fees are shown to be insufficient to pay miners (i.e., when the hashing power is not high enough).

My reading of the article is as follows: 
* Bulbs were an investment in the early 1630s for many local nobles
* Germany had a crisis peasant revolt in late 1636, so the princes dug up their own bulbs &amp; sold them, causing the price to fall precipitously 
* The Dutch nobles, who had previously invested in the bulbs (in a leveraged manner), began to lose money and go insolvent because they had entered into futures contracts to purchase bulbs at the pre-1636 higher price
* Rather than go through with the contracts, the Dutch nobles successfully petitioned the Dutch legislature to convert these futures contracts into option contracts (with the contract-holder paying 3% the contract price of an un-exercised option)
* The now-option prices rose substantially (10-20x) to account for the shifted risk, whereby the contract-holders would pay the tulip-seller only this small 3% to not exercise the option
Thus, the oft-repeated tulip-madness trope is just a rational reaction to changing rules on how contractual obligations would be borne.

Historically people theorized things has value for different reasons, such as the amount out labor required to make a thing.
Austrian economists in the 19th century proposed a simpler solution: value is determined by the collective preferences of everyone who demands a particular thing. This has since been mostly accepted in economics, but you still hear people speaking of intrinsic value from time to time because it sounds so attractive.
I believe the only thing with intrinsic value is human life and potentially things that are life-sustaining.

Sure, if you cannot afford to lose your bitcoin holdings, you should reduce your holdings of bitcoin. 
But rebalancing (especially doing so frequently) guarantees that you will miss out on much of the up-side if Bitcoin "succeeds."*

Although, my opinion may be biased: I'm generally not in favor of rebalancing for stocks anyway. Imo, if you want a balanced portfolio, buy index funds and don't give it another thought.

Irrespective of XT, I would argue that this position undermines a major feature of bitcoin: the capacity to incorporate any necessary technological / economic changes to remain the "longest chain." The "network effect" of cryptocurrencies suggests that there will be a single dominant coin, but a narrow view of "what Bitcoin is" by could make it more difficult for "Bitcoin" to compete for this position.  
[This is unlikely to have an impact in the near-term, but policies that make Bitcoin less nimble and adaptable run the risk of inhibiting Bitcoin's future.]

I think the online banking analogy is apt. Let’s say you’re carrying a really long password on a piece of paper that gives you access to your bank account containing $11,000. I don’t think that would qualify, even though you could technically only access it with that piece of paper.

Does this count transactions in blocks or transactions posted? In either case, don’t think it’s necessarily concerning:
Also, because the price necessarily rises with demand (and new block size can’t be supplied except by segwit / forks), you would expect there to be countervailing downward pressure on # of transactions as the fee price rises.

So, is there any confidence that the model is better than random chance?  I don't see the report mentioning any sort of control sample; it seems to find correlations and discuss theoretical contributors.  Perhaps it would be impossible to make a control sample without verified sock puppet data, but that doesn't make presenting the raw correlation any more useful. At best this gives a hypothesis to test out.
Self-reported data from this thread might be used to build a list of account pairs that suggest that they are not sock puppets. It's not perfect, sure, since you have to assume the account users are telling the truth, but it's just another metric. 
For instance: I have no relation to this account is not my puppet and I am not its.

A few rebuttals that come to mind:
* It is potentially more environmentally friendly than the alternative (banking sector, money changers, etc.).
* Bitcoin could serve as a waste-electricity sink. A substantial of electricity production goes either under-utilized or un-used, since usage drops significantly during the night and many sources of electricity are only productive during a certain period of the day, etc. Mining can be a productive way to make use of the excess capacity &amp; generation. 
* As long as the electricity's price is properly incorporating externalities, the market will sort out how it's used. This may rely on a carbon tax / credit system. (Which I presume the Green Party is in favor of anyway, so it doesn't pose a problem unless people choose to oppose mining simply because it uses electricity at all.  If this view is held, more subtle persuasion may be necessary.)

Mining revenue has to pay for: (1) electricity, (2) labor, (3) rent, (4) capital cost of miners &amp; other equipment, and (5) reasonable profit.
Electricity is part of the equation, but not all of it.
The price affects the difficulty level (hashing / electricity cost), sure, but the difficulty level probably has very little effect on price itself. It doesn't turn into a sustainability problem because miners can cease mining once it becomes unprofitable to do so.
Edit: the economics during the "bootstrapping phase" of 50-25-12.5-6.75 block rewards will be a bit funky, leading to inflated difficulty / hashing, but eventually the value of increased difficulty will equilibrate with consumers' willingness to pay transaction fees.

By ERIC LICHTBLAU
APRIL 9, 2015
WASHINGTON — Presidential fund-raising, never known for its transparency, may have just become even more secretive.
In announcing his candidacy for president this week, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky waded into new waters when he said he would accept campaign contributions in Bitcoins, a largely untraceable virtual currency, in amounts up to $100.
Interested donors at randpaul.com were given three options for making a contribution: a credit card, PayPal or Bitcoin. While some state and federal candidates in California, Colorado, New Hampshire and elsewhere have started accepting Bitcoins, Mr. Paul, a Republican, is the first presidential candidate to do so.
The novelty of the payment method is likely to help Mr. Paul highlight his edgy appeal to other libertarians, tech-savvy voters, young people and others who favor Bitcoin. But it also raises questions about whether illegal contributions could make their way into campaigns more easily.
The Bitcoin itself is essentially untraceable if the owner wants to maintain anonymity, and political candidates who accept them must rely largely on donors’ disclosing their identity.
Federal law bans contributions to individual candidates from foreigners, corporations or straw donors, among other restrictions, and campaigns are expected to make their “best efforts” to collect and publicly identify donors who contribute more than $200 in a year and to detect contributions that may be illegal.
“At some level, we are trusting candidates,” said Richard L. Hasen, a campaign finance expert at the University of California, Irvine School of Law. The system already relies on some measure of trust from candidates, he said, “but the difference with Bitcoin is that it is inherently untraceable.”
In a ruling last year, the Federal Election Commissionagreed to allow a political action committee to accept Bitcoins with a voluntary limit of $100, but the commissioners split over how the online currency — which can fluctuate widely in value — should be treated on a broader scale or whether it should be capped.
“Bitcoins are no more anonymous than any other contribution,” wrote Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner who was then the chairman of the panel. He said that technological innovations should be embraced in the political system and that Bitcoins should be treated no differently than a computer, securities, a painting or other legal, “in-kind” contributions.
But the three Democratic commissioners — Ann M. Ravel, Steven T. Walther and Ellen L. Weintraub — were much more cautious in endorsing the limited use of Bitcoins.
Bitcoins should be treated the same as cash, with a cap of $100, to protect against unethical and illegal activities, the three commissioners wrote. “The fact that Bitcoins are ultimately untraceable makes prophylactic measures at the outset of the transaction particularly important,” they said. The commission did not adopt the cap.
For Mr. Paul, who has been sharply critical of the government’s electronic surveillance programs as an attack on privacy, his embrace of Bitcoins – with their added layers of privacy – is a way to establish his bona fides with younger voters who put a premium on Internet freedom and technology.
“Senator Paul will run the most tech innovative campaign in 2016,” a spokesman, Sergio Gor, said when asked about the decision to accept the digital currency. “From Snapchat to Bitcoin, we’ll engage in various forums before anyone else.”
“This is certainly new territory,” said David Mitrani, a Washington lawyer who specializes in campaign finance law and has represented several candidates who have accepted Bitcoins.
“It is traceable, but only if the campaign follows the strict instructions that were given by the commission” for identifying the donor, he said. “If a committee doesn’t implement these strict measures, there’s certainly a concern.”
As an experiment, Mr. Mitrani tried to make an online donation of more than $200 in Bitcoins on Mr. Paul’s campaign website — above the voluntary limit that his campaign placed on Bitcoin donations.
The donation was rejected. “Bitcoin donations are limited to $100,” the automated response said. “If you would like to contribute more than $100, you may select Credit Card as your payment option and contribute up to $2,600 for the primary election and up to $2,600 for the general election.”
Representative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, became the first member of Congress to accept Bitcoins as donations last year.
Mr. Polis said he collected $1,986 in Bitcoins, a tiny fraction of the nearly $1.2 million he raised over all in his 2014 re-election. He said Bitcoins were not only a way to give people another way to donate, but also to show his support for Internet freedom, a cause he has championed.
“It’s no riskier than any other kind of contribution,” he said.
Bitcoin enthusiasts predicted that Mr. Paul would be the first of many presidential candidates to rake in Bitcoins.
“He’s at the forefront of a tech revolution, like the first candidates to have websites,” said Brian Klein, a Los Angeles lawyer and a Bitcoin supporter who has represented many clients involved in the currency.
“I bet other presidential candidates will follow his lead, and soon,” Mr. Klein said. “I also believe in a year or two, this won’t be a story because every candidate will accept Bitcoins — just like every candidate has a website.”

I guess it isn't a major worry that the wrong choice will be made by miners/nodes (and a proposal is coming in the coming months), but rather the 260k cap deters some companies from jumping in because it is still quite small. 
Btc has enough room for some applications, but many major chains see millions of customers per day. They might not want to risk entering the ecosystem. in before btc can handle their (although, this probably over-estimates adoption potential in the short run).

Definitely (but I usually don't open with it because people worried about collusion are perhaps less likely to be swayed by pure market arguments). The great thing is that antitrust law in the US has generally been moving in this direction. Low barriers to entry have come to be seen as the way to maximise consumer surplus. The "government action" exclusion is still problematic, but maybe there are some cracks forming in that doctrine as well. (The recent NC Dentists v. FTC case turned out well.)

But I would say that perfect competition means 0 opportunity cost (long run) compared to a different utilization of capital, rather than an actual profit of 0.

coinbase.com has a daily "buy limit" of $3000 per day at the first verification level (bank account and address, iirc) for bank transfers. Further, once an order is placed via bank transfer (ACH), it takes a few days to be deposited into the account.
Circle has a weekly "buy limit" of $2,500, so I think coinbase would be a better source. (Or both.)
All together, it might take a week or a week and a half, provided that he cooperates. 
P.S.:I  recommend you open a circle or coinbase account and become verified yourself, so you can sell once the bitcoins are received (it may taken an hour for the transaction to be fully confirmed) and have USD deposited into your bank account.
P.P.S: if credit cards are the only option, it could take quite a while longer, since coinbase doesn't take credit cards directly and circle has a weekly limit of $500.

I'm surprised you saw such a large effect. Hopefully it wasn't a fat-tail scenario or something like that. :(
Generally I would caution against analogizing the Mozilla experience to normal online shopping. Since payment options are usually only available at the end of an online shopping transaction, I would expect the effect to be lessened compared to up-front visibility when making a donation. If a purchaser has already invested time &amp; effort in choosing a product and going partly through the initial steps of checking out, I would guess that the purchaser would be less deterred by an unfavorable payment option. (Maybe the 5.8 v. 7.5 explains that, but drawing analogies across populations is reckless.)

This phrase irritates some because it harkens back to the Labor Theory of Value, which was the basis for a lot of ignorance prior to the realization that humans create value by subjectively desiring things / services. Using "subjective value,""productive value," or just "value" would be better in the technical sense.

Fractional reserve lending is still possible with btc, because off-chain contracts are honored. 
If I borrow 1 btc from you and then lend 0.9 BTC to a third party borrower, the money supply (technical definition) has now risen on paper to 1.9 BTC (your holdings in my bank and the 0.9 BTC held by another borrower).

Which is better, (1) a constant supply of bitcoins with the intrinsic volatility issues, or (2) a constant purchasing power for each bitcoin, with the supply variable to maintain this purchasing power?
Example: 1 bitcoin buys a basket of goods. As demand for bitcoins grows, the purchasing power grows commensurately, such that 0.9 bitcoins can now purchase the same basket of goods. When this change in purchasing power is detected by the protocol (via an oracle, for instance), each bitcoin grows into 1.111 bitcoins, returning the purchasing power to 1 bitcoin = 1 basket. 
The gains are distributed evenly throughout all holders of bitcoins, so I think the two options would be economically equivalent. Potential issues related to the oracle's accuracy (and the problem adjusting the basket over time to reflect technological improvement) aside, would it be psychologically better to have 10% more bitcoins or bitcoins worth 10% more?
[Yes, bitcoins don't exist and that might make the implementation more difficult, but ignore that part for the sake of this thought experiment.]

How? Once smartphones become more commonplace. It will take a few years for prices to fall and adoption to rise. I've seen estimates that by 2019 smartphones should be a sizeable portion of phones in the developing world.
Positive effects?: Holding value without anyone else knowing. In some parts of the developing world it's nigh impossible to save capital when friends / family know you are doing so. Even if BTC falls in value, its capacity to protect wealth from physical appropriation is pretty valuable. I'm not sure if this is as applicable in the middle east, but it has been true in Africa (and one of the most redeeming features of services like mpesa).
Of course, btc is still a very speculative store of value, so competition with fiat denominated services could be difficult. Bitreserve and coinapult hedging features would be helpful, but even those transaction costs might be high compared to other services.

I would argue that Bitcoin mining doesn't necessarily qualify, since the marginal cost and barriers to entry are not 0.
I like to think of equilibrium breaking down like this:


The profit margin shouldn't be monopolistically high or anything, but it should just be reasonable compared to the other places you can invest your time/money in the economy. Hypo: if mining gives 10% ROI and alternatives in the economy gives 5% ROI, then capital will enter the mining ecosystem and its return will fall to 5%.

If bitcoin were threatened in such a manner, it would probably have gone underground and implemented encrypted traffic of some sort (which I think should get around the threat you describe). It would slow adoption probably, but not kill it.
There’s not much threat at this point in the current climate, but anything can change. If this threatening change does occur I doubt it would come from ISPs.
 Net neutrality could be more threatening if implemented because “suspicious” traffic could simply be banned by the administrator of net neutrality. And bitcoin could be deemed suspicious . . .

The "centralization" and "adverse incentives of miners points" are really nonissues (largely because the economies of scale of mining aren't infinite and the barriers to entry are relatively low due to pool mining). 
Perhaps the cost v. security of Proof of Stake will prove better than Proof of Work in the long run, but Bitcoin will be in the bootstrapping phase for several years so it is hard to compare apples to apples.

But one aspect of the future of mining is that individual miners don't necessarily require scale to break into profitability, they just need sufficiently cheap electricity and reasonable access to mining devices. 
Scale helps you get better prices for utilities, miners, rent, etc., but it isn't as crucial as in many other industries. And if heating your home with electricity is viable and you have some extra space / bandwidth, mining may help better-utilize existing capital. 
The barriers of entry to mining and/or making miners are objectively pretty low, so there's potential for hobbyists to have a resurgence in the future.

Consensus is also affected by the holders of coins, theoretically. Even if it becomes centralized by a few miners (which I doubt it will, since the economies of scale are not naturally infinite or very large for physical or corporate centralization), they would be deterred from making changes that the market didn't prefer. If a bad change were made (or if a major fork breaks up the network), one would expect the price of BTC to fall significantly. I think this wealth-destroying effect of bad decisionmaking and destabilization creates a pretty big incentive to get extremely high consensus and make only changes that survive strict scrutiny.
And there's also that democracy is a poor method for aggregating preferences, so I don't see much of an alternative to consensus forking with its incrntive-aligning relationship to the price.

The market cap doesn't matter to a large extent if you're just using it for small transactions. Of course, it caps the amount you can liquidate/buy without affecting the price too much, but that shouldn't be a problem for small day-to-day transactions where you want privacy.
On the storing value issue, volatility and inflation (depending on the monetary policy of the coin) could big detractors. But it can't be lost or stolen unless the private keys are lost/stolen, so its main virtue in this regard is in the form of increased physical security.

The bitcoin blockchain is stored on thousands of computers worldwide and essentially immutable after 10 minutes. (Edit: Maybe an hour depending on certain factors.)
How it would work: a block of transactions (including hash of a document) is "mined" at a given time, and then subsequent blocks are "mined," with each given block including a hash of the prior block for validity. This chain of hashes means that someone essentially (theoretical impossibility with given technology for all intents and ppurposes) cannot go back and change data in an earlier block and forge something on the chain.

"Actual investors" don't seem to realize where they'll be once the block subsidy (i.e., security subsidy) runs out. 
If Bitcoin has no users (or is capped at 3tps) --&gt; Bitcoin has far less security because not enough hashing power will chase the small block reward that remains --&gt; even at $1 per transaction, it would be only $250k per day, which is less than a quarter of the $1.1 million that is paid to miners today.
Proposals that give miners power to inflate the fee run the risk of creating a "free-market cartel", where entry and exit is easy but the consumer is presented with a fixed &amp; inflated price and bitcoin's security level isn't able to be chosen directly by a market mechanism.

A couple of points: 
* Your taxation provisions would probably cover every transaction for BTC, creating a gain/loss whenever you use btc to make a purchase. This is a huge, nigh unenforceable, hurdle. (If treated like a currency by the US IRS, only transactions resulting in a capital gain of $200 or more will result in a taxable event. See US federal tax code.) 
* Legal tender (afaik), only covers debts. Merchants are generally free to restrict forms of payment that they accept. I'm not sure if this has been tested in case law, but there are plenty of businesses that don't accept large bills. You should probably remove the provision at the end of Ch.2.

[I understand the concern, but I personally don't view this as a problem. Reverse [tyranny of the market]( of sorts: if there are enough consumers that want to spend USD, there will be merchants that accept USD (and/or a profitable opportunity for market entry). Merchants that accept only BTC will be severely limiting their consumer base, but it might make sense for certain industries (e.g., marijuana business that can't access banking).]
If you still want to accomplish your objective, I would suggest changing the words "A merchant" to "such merchant" (or merchants exclusively accepting cryptocurrencies) to specifically refer to merchants described in the preceding section.

In the long run, providing demand deposit accounts like checking could be partially displaced by btc, but fractional reserve lending will still be technically feasible (and something like FDIC will still exist to support illiquid [but still solvent] banks). So the traditional model of lending in the community and sharing the interest with depositors is likely to be continue (but could be less profitable).
On the btc-specific side of things, people might like a service to secure their btc. Either by holding one of a m-of-n splits to a HD wallet recovery seed, providing multisig escrow, or actually holding the coins for customers.  BTC decreases the cost to individuals of supplying their own physical security, but some people might still like a specialized intermediary to trust. As long as security measures are taken and private keys are insulated from the internet / disgruntled employees, the risks of holding btc should be minimized to the normal currency exchange rate fluctuations.
And also, since the bank has already done AML/KYC for its current customers, it can potentially provide BTC exchange services without much trouble. (Or help facilitate another party providing these services. Coinbase, etc., have bank partners, afaik.)

Entirely offline, yep. Ideally you wouldn't use a Wi-Fi-enabled printer (or turn it off) to avoid that vector. And as long as your printer doesn't have a hard drive or other long term storage, power cycling it should clear traces of wallet (this may vary based on printer).
Also, the latent risk that you bought a printer with a btc-snooping vulnerability is probably far less than the risk that the kernel of a btc-specific piece of hardware is compromised anyway. You can't get to 100% without doing it all yourself, but entropy avoids many of the typical weak points.

If this means zero-knowledge, I think using that terminology would be worthwhile. 
Suggested services: circle, coinbase, bitstamp, other major exchanges, public master key importing for armory, electrum, other HD wallets.
On the API side, if you can limit it to "watching only," (as default, or just an optional feature) when accessing a coinbase wallet for example, it would make users feel safer. Granting control of coins via API takes a lot of trust.
Another useful feature: keeping track of btc purchases for tax purposes. The IRS makes every transaction a taxable event, so having a single service to keep track of everything would be useful for some people.

It might be ETF v ETN distinction. The ETN is technically a debt contract that follows bitcoin (and doesn't necessarily have to be backed by bitcoin), the ETF is backed by an actual basket of bitcoins held by the issuer.
Since the company providing the ETN here is hedging the btc price, it shouldn't make a difference, but there's also always that pass-through effect of bankruptcy risk; if the issuer goes bankrupt: (I think this is how it works) for an ETF you get the commodity (or value thereof?), but an ETN you're left with a claim in bankruptcy court.

It probably depends on age of user. If you're in your mid 20s and got in a few years ago, I would guess it's pretty high. If it fails or you bet on the wrong crypto, you'll have a chance to rebuild.
If you're older and already had investments in other things, it's probably lower (and you likely have a more conservative approach generally). The cost of failure is quite a bit higher.

Confusion is theoretically more likely, since you don't have an easily identifiable benchmark, but I think there would still be a benefit to consider.
Maybe it wouldn't be any different in security than requiring the same number of characters total (3 in front, 3 in middle, 3 at end v. 4 in front and 5 at end), but I think usability could suffer if you lengthen the front + end comparison portions. Adding a middle- based comparison would let you just compare small numbers of characters without getting too inconvenient for the end user.

If you're arguing against exclusive dealing agreements, then this still belongs in the realm of the FTC AND DoJ's Antitrust Division rather than FCC regulation. Such agreements do not generally harm consumer surplus in the absence of high barriers to entry (like government-enforced monopolies).

I suppose my thinking is that the mechanism will be more straightforward and less opaque. Part of the difficulty with the legislative process is that it's extremely easy (politically, i.e., via logrolling, bootlegger &amp; baptist strategy, etc.) to make very minor changes and incrementally pay off your respective interest group.
With btc, every major structural change essentially requires a supermajority and can't be hidden in a "must-pass" budget bill, for example. I feel it would be a lot harder to push through the kind of concentrated-benefit-dispersed-cost changes that result in monopolistic regulation and favoritism, which are prototypical in the current political process.

I don't believe this is correct. The D.C. Circuit in Jan. 2014 voided the FCC's attempt to enforce rate-discrimination since ISPs are not classified as common carriers, as discussed in [this]( news story. Net neutrality is not legal right now, which is why the FCC is being pressed to implement new rules &amp; it has developed into such a public issue.
The issue of selling "speeds up to10mbps" to 10 users fed by a single 20mbps line is more a case of potentially misleading advertisement. But it reflects how internet service is provided, from main conduits rather than direct lines to the provider (at least for cable). This tech background means that an ISP cannot guarantee a given bandwidth without underutilizing its capital (e.g., sell 10 1-mbps connections on a line with a maximum capacity of 10mbps). Differential pricing is one way to pass the cost of consuming additional content on to consumers, rather than spread that cost out to all consumers. [Which ISPs aren't doing anyway because it is not popular to do so. To the argument that they are just waiting, I would respond that we can have the net neutrality discussion again at that time. Precautionary regulation unnecessarily preempts new business models that could conceivably be even better for consumers.]
A key flaw in net neutrality is that it disincentivizes companys from building out content delivery networks or entering into preferential deals even if they feel that their traffic is important enough to pay an additional amount. If an MMO gaming company wants to prioritize its content as it flows to consumers, it could not do so under net neutrality. The unintended consequences of this regulation could decrease the quality of many applications of the internet for only a theoretical corresponding benefit. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:34:19

It's really two issues: (1) physical centralization and (2) mining pool centralization. 
In my view, the economies of scale to mining are not so great that physical centralization is inevitable. Cheap electricity, cheap labor &amp; mild climates can also be pretty big factors.
Conversely, mining pools have essentially no diminishing returns, so absolute centralization is more theoretically possible. But realistically there is a huge incentive to avoid a 51% scenario, since btc would lose a major aspect of block security. The price would hopefully incorporate this knowledge, incentivizing miners to break up.

The marginal cost of storing the additional data is pretty low, I'm skeptical that it would have a large negative effect on network node decentralization, which already depends on people utilizing hardware w/o compensation. 
Paying miners based on an artificially scarce block size will subsidize blockchain security in exchange for making it more expensive to transact. (3tx/sec, 1800 tx per 10-mins means that very few transactions globally can occur on the blockchain, requiring centralized off-chain systems.)
It's a policy choice to pay miners at the marginal cost of mining (plus whatever profit they will collectively demand), but I would rather have that result than guessing that staying at 1MB will be fine. Many of the incentive effects that the quoted people in the article discuss are based on the seigniorage-dominated block reward, which isn't ideal. But an artificial restriction of 1MB block sizes could more easily lead to a more abrupt failure of the currency than a partial removal of the restriction.
There are just too many moving parts to the btc economy to make me believe that the permanent quota of 1MB blocks is a good idea for miners, consumers, or bitcoin.

I would much rather the telcos compete on that aspect as well. I'm not sure if the barriers to entry aren't too high &amp; the industry full of cludge for that to happen, but 80% of US households have access to 2+ providers at 10mbps, so I'm willing to give it a shot.
When YouTube and Netflix use a combined 47% of the US downstream, you could say that they (and users) are exacting a cost on other internet users, a form of pollution if you like. Should the market have the opportunity to pass these costs along to the producers(and consumers of Netflix), or distribute them widely among all Internet consumers? [Perhaps the market will choose not to discriminate, as it has done so thus far, in response to consumer demand.]
Blocking encrypted traffic would be a terrible result, but it begs the question why it isn't occurring right now? ISPs have stayed neutral based on consumer preferences so far, and there's not much reason to think drastic changes will occur. Net neutrality generally includes exceptions for traffic that is illegal, malicious &amp; unwanted, so the telcos (or the FCC, or another 3-letter agency) could still block suspicious encrypted traffic on a whim.

Long term Btc-denominated contracts will be functionally impossible (hedging aside) without stable value in real terms. Businesses don't want to risk their cashflow in this manner.
Not permanently crippling, but it just means that btc won't be used as the primary contractual medium for quite some time.
Edit: oh, stability for everyday goods &amp; services relates to the long-term contracts aspect, but also includes psychological aversion to volatility. See shoeleather costs of inflation.

It isn't a get-rich-quick scam by the creator. 
[Seriously, the incentives of an altcoin creator to cash out are  high and this can result in alts being more prone to fraud. Not all alts are like this, but one generally doesn't want to be stuck trusting someone who has an opportunity to dump his/her coins and bail on the entire project.]

Legal tender has a fairly technical definition (I.e, legally obligated to accept the form of payment for debts). I don't think btc is ready for that yet. Forcing people to take it as payment could cause problems.

I don't know the actual implementation, but it could be set up like this: legislature enacts extremely broad law &amp; mandates that NYDFS promulgate regulations interpreting the broad law. Essentially informing the public how it will exercise prosecutorial discretion.
That's generally how US securities regulation works.
Alternatively, the legislature could simply delegate lawmaking power to the agency, depending on legality under NY's "nondelegation" doctrine.

To follow on point, It's also uncertain that forgoing the fees from a particular block for the chance to mine a block with higher fees in the future would be profitable. 
The barriers to entry in the mining industry are theoretically* very low, so the risk of a monopolist strategy should also be very low. 
* - mining and electricity centralization may impact this prediction, but it's probably too soon to be sure about these

Theoretically, I believe the argument relies on the underutilized Greek labor (&amp; probably capital), since unemployment is still incredibly high. "Borrowing" or creating money to pay these unemployed people to do productive activities (thereby inducing them to spend / invest the money that they are paid) is thought to be preferable than letting them sit idle.

If you double check the transaction with two nodes you can essentially avoid this risk (or at least make it very difficult to pull off). I think many of the payment processors do this to allow for quicker settlement.

Probably gyft, for both the reason you mention and that you'll be purchasing from a company that has done a lot to popularize btc and support the ecosystem (btc on their front page, btc in their ads, etc.).
You won't show up in Amazon's btc metric, but you'll show  up in their gyft metric. This could create an incentive to grant a native Amazon discount, depending on how much they read into the data.
Amazon will gain goodwill with me personally by accepting btc, but I'm not sure if it's enough to make me buy directly unless they are willing to split the windfall with me.

I'm characterizing the 1MB block limit as artificial and arbitrary because there is no natural (market-based) reason for blocks to be limited to such a size. There might be pragmatic reasons for some limit (feasibility of block propagation based on node download speed), but I don't think external limits should be imposed without a strong technical reason.
If the block size is allowed to float up to a maximum of 20MB (and increase over time per Gavin's proposal), supply and demand are not hindered from reaching the "natural" equilibrium level of difficulty v. block reward. The difficulty level will be related to the value that btc provides, that users are willing to pay for via trx fees. I have more confidence in this result than in an imposed scarcity of block dude that inevitably leads to deadweight loss &amp; a transition to off-chain trxs.
Maybe btc doesn't survive, but I would rather give it the best chance to do so by leaving it largely unencumbered by limits that aren't based on price discovery, etc.

Worldwide global settlement is definitely one of the most useful current applications. This is great for remittances or purchasing digital content from another country, which can be a real pain otherwise.
Other cases include lighthouse crowdfunding, avoiding CC datamining when making purchases, streamlined checkout/donation processes that don't reveal any financial information, and other gift card / purchase sites like brawker &amp; purse.io which give greater discounts.
You lose the convenience of chargebacks, but this can get you put on a "blacklist" if you use it often and merchants often provide robust return services anyway (as required by law in most US States).

I don't like the characterization of the seigniorage directly as a "cost," since it really is just the revenue of the mining network and doesn't include the profit margin that miners receive.
Aside from that, I agree with most of what you said. The coinbase transactions are subsidizing the network security level and the cost will eventually be borne by users directly.

You could accept payment in coin or small bills, things less likely to be counterfeited. [This might be really inconvenient though.]

The over-the-counter (large volume) market spread is larger than that on small exchanges. Companies that receive large amounts of BTC can take advantage of this to still make profits even if they are buying btc at the "market price."

Yes, living on 100% btc is a novelty and will probably end up costing you money, but there are still many useful applications out there.
Gyft/eGifter give 3% in rewards, which more than offsers the 1% conversion fee. There are also options like cardflip.com which sell gift cards at a discount, with bitcoin purchasers getting an additional % off. [At cardflip you can buy walmart gift cards and use those directly for groceries / gas (via Sam's Club).]
It's not universally consumer-beneficial yet, but there are plenty of use cases where it outperforms alternative payment methods.

Securities aren't actually just ownership in a company, that's just one of the definitions. 
"Investment contracts" are traditionally considered securities as well:  In this case, people were buying the right to receive oranges from an orange grove, without actual ownership in a company.
There's certainly arguments that this definition is too broad, but it has been sanctioned by the courts for decades. 
If misleading hash contracts are going on (and the business model seems fundamentally flawed), sending the SEC after the sellers is actually a good thing.

I don't think it would have as large direct economic effect, but it should have a few indirect effects: (if enacted)
* As the first jurisdiction to accept it for payment of taxes, this would add legitimacy &amp; serve as a test case for other states to follow if it turns out to be worthwhile (if savings are realized, if taxpayers prefer it).
* A portion of the value of btc comes from the ways you can spend it. As adoption increases, this "velocity value" increases. [The bulk of btc value is speculation-based rather than velocity-based, so this will likely be small in magnitude.]
I agree with your skepticism though, this probably won't lead to a large new demand for btc and will almost certainly be through a payment processor. [And could result in a short-term price decline if people use it as a BTC-liquidation method.]
