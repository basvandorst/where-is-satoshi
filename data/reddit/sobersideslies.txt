I would pay for a lawyer to fight me ex for more time with me son and to keep him in the state he has grown up in and where his family is.  She is trying to to move 1200 miles away and I don't have the money to fight it.  I own a small business and I scrape by to make payroll now.  To be honest if I lose the custody battle I will just sell my assets and move across the country and live out of a tent if that's what I have to do to be in my sons life.  At this point in my life the $10,000 for a legal team to keep my son is all I would care about.

No.  They didn’t show even as pending 24 hours later l thought I hit a wrong button texting while I was doing something more important.  Money was even still in my bank acct.  so I did it again.  I look later and there are 2 pending now.  So I put a stop payment on it.  I would have let it go through but if it didn’t clear on by Friday I wouldn’t have the money for bills.

 No.  It wasn’t that.  I made a large deposit and I didn’t see it go through later that day.  Not pending or anything.  So I thought I fucked up.  So I did it again.  Then they both show up...so I had to have my bank put a stop payment on one of the purchases.  8 days later my other purchase is still pending .  So I talk to their chatbot and was getting pissed because it was a decent amount of money.  Their chatbot says they can’t help me and it could be up to another 2 weeks before that transaction was verified due to the stop payment.  Making it 3 weeks total.  I guess it’s hard on their network for stop payments but they wouldn’t even let my buy bitcoin with my debit card.  They fixed that but put my $200 limit back on.  So I told the chatbot that I could get access to my money faster by just putting in another stop order and using my bank, who has a telephone.
Then they shut me down lol.
