@_date: 2018-01-17 08:01:55
FURTHER FUCKING MORE.....god you pissed me off lol. You don't need an exchange to transact in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:29:55
No worries. I was in your shoes a few years ago and this tech is a big rabbit hole. If you want to think of the price, than yes it acts like a stock market in that prices go up and down. But it really is not a stock market. You're 'share' of bitcoin is similar to your 'share' in the U.S. Fed when you have a couple dollars in your wallet. Why does the function work? Well, to make a long story short: math. Math and economics lie at the heart of the Bitcoin network. The math secures each bitcoin as well as proves to everyone on the network that A) this person has X amount in bitcoin and b) this person can spend X amount in Bitcoin. If you try to spend more than you have, the network knows. If you try to send the same bitcoin to two different people, the network knows. Furthermore, bare with me, math also keep the network running. Every ten minutes, a group of transactions are confirmed as valid by supercomputers spread across the world. These super computers compete against each other to be able to say "I, supercomputer A, approve all these transactions and have verified they have been sent to a person by a person". If the super computers all agree that that computer was the first to confirm these transactions, then the network rewards them with a certain amount of bitcoin as well as all fees included in each transaction they verified. Thus, there will always be an incentive for large mining(these super computers are known as miners) companies to invest in computers that will compete for this reward. As the price in bitcoin goes higher, so too does that reward.

You realize the likelihood of you living in Africa and having a faster, cheaper, more secure currency that Bitcoin is rare right? You and me are privileged by living in a world that does not suffer from economic problems. [Do not assume everyone has your economic privilege](
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:18:47
Why do you argue it is nothing new? Human history has never had a form of money that is as efficient as Bitcoin AND not be backed or forced by a single entity as the default currency for a population.
And I would say how is it not doing anything better than what is already being done? If you had to send $1 million to someone in Africa at midnight, how would you do it and how long would it take for the money to be sent and for the money to be received? While you think about that, I can send that same amount in Bitcoin to the same person and same place in seconds. In 10 minutes they will have a confirmation that other people recognize the money has been sent and in 1 hour it will be so secure that no one can take that individuals money or prevent them from spending it unless they find 25 hidden words.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:32:12
Ahh, so you are pretty aware of what's going on. That's great! Yes, the network has gotten quite expensive to use and alas, it probably would cost my a significant amount of fees if I wanted to send $10 using the BTC network and have it confirmed quickly. But there is so much time to improve the system!!! It's only been 9 nine years! The future is bright and I for one am optimistic and confident you will eventually be using bitcoin in the background. You just won't really know you are ;)

@_date: 2018-01-17 06:20:53
No no, value is generated. What's the value being generated? Well, computers are transferring huge amounts of energy into bitcoin. By using electricity, they are taking a cost, an expense, into proving cryptographic hash functions for the purposes of securing a global network and are thus rewarded every ten minutes for their hard work. The more you have in expenses, the more likely you will receive a reward.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:03:24
Hey there. Well, owning a stock means you own part of a company. Owning a bitcoin or even a fraction of a bitcoin means you own a piece of data that has certain properties that allow it to act as a currency. Bitcoin is not a company, it is a peer to peer network very similar to the peer to peer network me and you are responding to each other on.

@_date: 2018-01-17 02:09:16
Precisely. Value now has a different definition however. That is, the dollar has value because the U.S. population trusts it as a currency. Why? Well, because we've all grown up knowing that the dollar can buy goods and services and furthermore is backed by the U.S government should people start to lose faith in it. Bitcoin has the same value, in that it can be used as a currency, but the why is different. People don't trust a government to back it, instead they trust the mathematics and code that govern the Bitcoin network. Does that help at all??

I have to disagree with you again. Don't mistake a loud idea or comment by one to represent the views of many. You say censorship resistance money as if it's only use is to subvert laws. Yet, earlier I showed you an example of money being censored for free speech. We allow free speech even though the kkk would love to protest in the streets of minority communities. We shouldn't not allow censorship resistant money just because a few want to abuse it.

I personally don't want anarchy. Anarchy is chaos and chaos is not good for the world. I want a world where power, money, is not controlled by the few but instead by the many. Where money is secured not by the faith of a government but by math. Where money is fair and out of the hands of the corrupt.  I think you'll find many of us are on this side too.

I'd replace your last statement with 'And trust that a later date its value will be relatively equal to when I first received it and I can use it to transact with in return for a variety of goods and services". But yes, you seem to be mostly getting it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:05:49
No worries. I understand you're skepticism. My guess was based on your comment that seemed to imply bitcoin has no value. I argue against that, obviously, but if you wouldn't mind I'd love why you think that?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:18:53
I think I read an article that countered that but I can't find. Assuming you're correct, I'd argue the distribution will be much better down the line. Additionally, the bitcoin rich are not in control of the money supply. Miners take this role and if they choose rules users don't like, then they will kill their golden goose. Miners and full nodes also enforce our consensus rules, again not the rich. Lastly, I'm OK with all these bitcoin millionaires. They took a risky and smart bet and won. They weren't born into money  because their ancestors earned it with a history of violence, coercion,  corruption or all of the above.

I totally get what you're saying. When I first started I did $20 here and there and gradually $50 here and there. I haven't purchased since before the U.S.election. I was so close to just 1 BTC I decided to use some of my tax return towards that last piece I needed. My intention is actually to earn the next BTC but we will see. I don't have a unique service or product yet. Part of me today did worry when the price dropped but I realized I forgot how the media and traders can blowup bitcoin news. Especially the bitcoin being as complex as it is and knowing new hodlers panic as well. Thank you for reminding me of that.

Congrats. Same here as well. Very few people I interact with would want to carry a conversation on about it, let alone even know what I am talking about. It's a hard concept to discuss with most. Money is just money and they're not interested in going farther than that. However, I have found there are a good amount that enjoy to listen to an explanation of what it is. But honestly, for regular day to day purchases, visas and cash are much easier for the average consumer. People don't have to think with visa. You swipe the card and the money leaves from my bank to their bank. But with bitcoin, there's so many layers to it. I remember Andreas Antonopolous once said bitcoin is an onion layer and I recently understood what he meant. Most people laughed at how the Internet was this crazy new thing that was hard to understand and only scientists used . Now, some kids don't even bink an eye when communicating with others through emojis on Facebook and YouTube. It'll will happen eventually and people will just know it as a network that either ensures they get paid for something or enables them to pay others for something through whatever coin they choose to transact with.

Same thoughts. $3k tops but that's being overallly optimistic 
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:15:41
I am also slightly worried about the price as well. I've bought the majority of mine prior to the price hitting $1K. I've definitely lost about $10 since this most recent purchase but, the long run, I'm still in the green. I'll most likely sell once I get to close to coming even. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:01:10
I had to sell some bitcoin recently for financial reasons. While I was deeply saddened to sell, I now have your comment to reflect on in a month. Thank you for your +10% comment. I never thought of that. I'll be sure to do that in 1 month. It's also nice to know other people aren't just hodling. I feel like on this subbreddit everyone talks about hodling. Continuously spending is the best way to get bitcoin out to others in my opinion. Hodling just treats it like an investment. If it's meant to be a currency, we should be constantly working for bitcoin, saving bitcoin AND spending bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-18 05:31:51
It's not as easy as you think. A large portion of the Bitcoin community cannot seem to understand people aren't as technical as you. Trezor is not easy to the average Joe and Jane. I'm sorry but peoplr here need to accept that. Coinbase is a good starting point. I started with coinbase and three months later I invested in a trezor. I'm fine. It's disheartening to see so many people tell everyone how easy it is to be your own bank. I think it's easy yes, but I am on a computer every day. I understand the difference between private and public keys. I understand how to recover a lost or stolen trezor. But as soon as I explain it to someone else, or send them an informative video, 3/4 the people I explain it to lose interest.

Don't worry about it. I get what you're saying. Coinbase is fine. Is it the best? No. Do I reccomend it to a first time user? Absolutely. Andreas Antopolous uses it. Maybe used now, but he's confirmed he has used it. I always say coinbase at first and I find out they like Bitcoin I then explain trezor to them. No need to call people faggots.

Well, most of these altcoins are created by people who feel they have a unique idea. Satoshi showed us the tools we need to create bitcoin and altcoins in general. At this point, it's completely free for anyone to inovate and create whatever coin their heart desires. It will really be up to the market and their technology on whether or not it helps society as a whole, even if that society is as local as a village or small town. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:19:35
So sick of the price posts
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:39:48
Fees are not fixed. Depending on what wallet you have, you can sometimes specify the amount you'd like to spend in fees. Higher fees means a higher probability your transaction will quickly enter a block. Unfortunately,  fees can currently be what many would consider high. However, many believe with segwit that fees will be lower for those who choose wallets that utilize segwit technology. It should also be noted though that others do not agree segwit will help. In my opinion though, it is a small and immeasurable subset of people. It should also be known that some core developers believe fees will not go down and it's a feature of Bitcoin rather than a bug. Time will tell us but I believe the market may also favor lower fees. I think right now though the majority of the current market is more interested in different properties of Bitcoin such as being decentralized or censorship resistant. Thus, as a result, low fees have yet to be really addressed other than segwit as a solution. Many in the community and particularly this subreddit believe segwit will lower fees.

I'd love to discuss with you how exactly you did this. Sounds like you had a big advantage but the fact that you have kept it up is amazing. Do you literally get paid in BTC, or do you have your paychecks go straight to BTC through a third party? PM me if you'd rather discuss privately.

Yo, people talking about price is inevitable and you'll never change it. I've only been around for 2 years now, but it's been like this for a while.

I wasn't trying to associate freedom with happiness. Ultimately, I think you are correct and you've helped lean me towards your line of thought. Do you think these voluntary regulations will be enough to fund healthy societies for the majority of its residents?
@_date: 2016-12-28 06:30:06
What of Denmark? They pay extremely high taxes and consistently rate as one of the happiest countries. Many European countries happily pay taxes and are happy doing so. Your opinions are very U.S. based. I disagree with the  opinion that taxes are evil. I would agree, especially in the U.S., that taxes are often wasted or misused. If handled correctly though, they're an investment in society. The problem lies in taxes not being transparent. I agree with voluntary contributions for the future but will that be enough to fund schools, roads, power grids, police, hospitals, etc. that a thriving society will always need? Maybe, but not in our near future.

Do you not realize the power of putting fiat into Bitcoin instead of a bank?
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:10:20
Well, one there is no such thing as 'the technology'. Bitcoin has its own technology, the Bitcoin blockchain. Ethereum has it's own technology, the Ethereum blockchain. Monero has....and etc, etc.
Also, the problem with placing your trust in a company means you are ok with trusting whoever owns that company and whoever they have to listen to i.e. governments. Part of the lore of bitcoin is that no one owns it, not just because of its technology. If VISA used a blockchain to compete against Bitcoin it wouldn't matter. Visa is a single entity and thus we have lost the decentralized and permissionless nature many of us are seeking to build.

Woke up to the news this morning on the lnd slack channel. SO STOKED
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:02:07
Hello fellow hodler. Everything is new when you learn about Bitcoin.
Essentially, early this year the Bitcoin community had a dilemma. Do we increase the 1mb blocksize, do we activate [segwit]( or do we do both? An agreement was made early Summer at [Consensus 2017]( where many Bitcoin companies came together and said ["Let's do Both"]( and made an agreement to do so. As context: Generally, it's believed many core developers did not attend nor were invited to the meeting responsible for the agreement. It's also true that for the general public, the price tag for this event was pretty [high](
Well what happened? Three groups emerged.
The "Let's increase the blocksize" crowd created [Bitcoin Cash(Bcash, BCH)]( on August 1st and did not activate segwit.
The group that wanted to activate segwit, [Bitcoin Core(legacy chain, BTC)]( did so on August 1st but with no blocksize increase.
Now the "Let's do both" group is up. Since the agreement, "2x" has been coined to represent the future chain of this group's agreement. 2x stands for 2 times the 1mb blocksize of the core chain which also means their chain would INCLUDE segwit. Their hard fork which would create this chain is scheduled to occur sometime in November.
Have I lost you yet?
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:43:12
As I stated earlier, obviously they won't give a shit. That's not the point of this post.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:37:05
Interesting, I've never heard the argument that running a lightning network payment channel could be expensive? Could you explain further why or how it would be more expensive than say large blocks?
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:59:35
Um...I don't think so. To the best of my knowledge they're on board with 2x. 
Do you have source saying otherwise? I can't find anything. They are apart of the agreement.
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:51:29
Thank you for the clarification 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:39:48
Yes and no. A hostile takeover is by definition a takeover of a company of which Bitcoin is not. IMO it's all open source. Anyone can take the code, modify it, convince miners they're right, and roll the dice. I'm not even concerned, I think users and miners are more rational that that.
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:16:17
I doubt it but maybe? I think they'll add replay protection or abandon it last minute. Time will tell though.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:01:40
You can increase the blocksize all you want. It will never be able to compete with Visa without Layer 2
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:07:31
Will you send me bitcoin if I do?
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:36:38
It's not even that I think they should or should not follow the 2x chain. Let the free market take care of it. And after all, this is open source. But I listen to Bitcoin podcasts on the daily, I follow people from all sides of Twitter, I really try to keep myself informed. This 2x chain is not regarded highly. Especially considering many wallets have yet to upgrade to segwit. I just want any coinbase employees out there to know I, despite many, do enjoy your service. They're shitty, but I enjoy it. I will leave your business though if you support this hard fork. We already have two major hard forks, and Bitcoin cash will either succeed, exceed, or fail. Let Bitcoin cash determine the causes of large blocks. We already have a block size increase. Developers are STOKED for segwit. We haven't even had time for them to deploy the possible. Let's just wait and keep the discussion going. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:02:14
A little of everything but mostly build something 
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:20:15
Can't argue with the replay protection part. For sure it's more dangerous. I mean they're playing another game of chicken. They think replay protection will allow them to take over bitcoin when in reality it will lose so much development as the core team leaves.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:22:15
How is it like gambling at all?
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:54:59
You should at least read his [response]( otherwise we're no better than r/btc. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:28:57
Not really.


More users and higher adoption. Visa is the King of this right now. The point is we do want more users and more adoption. I just don't believe raising the blocksize limit will ever allow us to reach as many users and adoption as Visa. If Visa still competes better at transaction per second than Bitcoin will never get more users and adoption.
As I stated in another comment, I am not concerned with an immediate need to pay people cheaply. As an end goal sure, of course I want that as that would be good for the globe. But I value Bitcoin more as a censorship resistance store of value.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:58:23
ohhh. this sounds great. Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:23:24
Definitely. However, comparing other crytpocurrenices to Bitcoin is like comparing apples to oranges. I mean, comparing any cyrpto with another is comparing apples to oranges. To me, Bitcoin is valued not for transaction output but as a censorship resistance store of value. To me, even if Bitcoin cannot compete in TPS with other cyrptos I wouldn't mind too much. I'm a believer in layer 2 though so I am slightly biased.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:53:27
Look. I'm against 2x but this petty shit needs to stop. Quite frankly they're not enemies, they honestly believe they're helping bitcoin. Imo and in the opinion of others they're wrong, but they're just trying to help lower fees. Core devs are doing amazing work but not everyone. They're a large number of contributors that love bitcoin which is why it would be horrible for them to feel as if no longer belong if 2x is approved. No 2x for sure but you've listed names that have been supporting bitcoin from the early days. It's fair to disagree, but not to call someone an enemy of bitcoin if it's only because they disagree. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:24:16
'We'. I hope you can realize once you start saying 'we' you are creating a 'they' and once there is a 'they' you leave room to not listen to those who don;t understand 'we'. There will also be noobs in this space, at least for the next decade.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:56:59
You have to understand this is bound to happen for a while. If you really want to help then learn to code and pick the side you agree with :) 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:02:14


is is really that simple!? I'll try it tonight. Thank you!!
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:39:02
Well it's bound to happen because you have modern internet commenting mixed with tribalism in regards to communities regarding money. The money aspect changes a lot of things when compared to other groups. At least imo. Fantasy football groups who cares who does what or says what? But now we have communities dedicated to telling others why their money ismore valuable than yours. We have communities believing others are jeopardizing their money. I guess that's the point I was trying to make.
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:18:41
Hello there and thank you for your response. In your opinion, is it completely possible for a beginner to enter in the space with a entry level programmer position? Becoming a Bitcoin developer seems like an incredibly difficult task for someone who has some SQL knowledge and CodeAcademy Python experience. Maybe I just need to actually put in the hours but I find it hard to do with a 40 hour day job that has nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:03:20
Sorry, I meant 500gb but sounds good. Thanks for the advice.

Will i need two separate storages of the the blockchain? One for testnet and one for the mainnet?
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:34:45
I'm kind of playing around for now and experimenting with running a node. I've only dedicated about 500gb of my 1Tb hard drive. I know this isn't a lot, but do you think I'd last at least a year if i had main, test and reg all downloaded?
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:15:43
Normally I would believe that but I have a lot of respect for Jimmy Song, personally. But after these comments I have realized the price tag is too high, even if it would mean a great networking event. I think I'd rather HODL.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:38:56
Well of course not. Investment bankers work in a centralized environment. Each has a pro and con. Centralized systems are all about control and efficiency. There is no need to argue in a centralized environment for what is right and wrong. You simply go to a higher figure and do what you're told. Decentralized is about transparency and inclusion. It's easy to argue about what is right or wrong since we lack a central authority. But as a result, ideas can battle each other out until the better outperforms the other.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:53:30
OK, ill try both options. Thanks again and I'll let you know what i find.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:03:41
Yea but your argument of "Increasing the blocksize will enable more transactions per second" is irrelevant if it doesn't improve Bitcoin as a whole. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:05:30
Why are you bringing altcoiners into this? Of course not.
Miners are the security to the double spend problem. So yes I do believe they should be listen to AS MUCH as users and AS MUCH as developers.
I could also give two shits about what any market prices something. Bitcoin itself is undervalued so that already throws your futures market out the door. Bitcoin has a lot of definitions to a lot of people. All I can do is run a full node, approve the rules I agree on, educate myself and others, and hope/fight for the best. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 07:24:06
True true. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:12:58
Well, at least IMO and going back to your example of investment bankers, there's some big differences between how they work and how the Bitcoin community works. Long story short really goes down to investment bankers need to save face since this baking is their career. Their career depends upon rational conversations and they distance themselves from bickering. I'm sure behind close doors they do just as shady shit though tbh. Crypto on the other hand, because its decentralized you acquire all walks of like. 15 year olds to 70 year olds, anonymous usernames, public faces, bots, etc. Most fit in the less mature side and tend to remain anonymous. You'll find most civil conversations in this space take part between individuals sharing their identity with the audience that's listening. I wouldn't say decentralization leads to  low discourse standards, I would say it allows it much more easily than centralized systems. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:06:10
ehhh, bitcon cash proved otherwise. I don't know about "tanked". Maybe 50% of it's value?

@_date: 2016-10-31 01:21:44
No suggestions but I'd advise on having the mentality of a long term game. I myself am looking for the same thing as you but my interest in the blockchain has showed me this will be a long lasting technology. Just a word from one Bitcoin enthusiast to another.  PM if you'd ever like to share dialog. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:45:41
Yeah I noticed that too. I wish I lived in a world where Bitcoin is fully developed and these troll comments actually cost the troll 
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:31:14
Congrats man. I started the same as you about 10 months ago. Go slow. $30 here and there is what I did as well. Don't panic sell and before you buy always check bitcoin news just in case its better to wait a few more days. It's impossible to predict daily or weekly fluctuations but it doesn't hurt to take advantage of free information. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:56:02
Wow. I've thought all of this but could never articulate it quite as well as you. Thank you. One of the first things I recognized about ethereum was the amount of investment its gaining from big companies. I too think it will gear some profitable uses for centralized services and less for global peer-to-peer payments.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:23:20
What? How? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:52:43
Couldn't you argue the same for Bitcoin though? As in, regular users will not understand how Bitcoin works, but instead a group of developers made it possible for me to pay someone for something I want to buy? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:49:05

I really need to learn to sell and buy like this. If you don't mind me asking, what exchange do you use? 
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:10:24
Yes, absolutely! I always tell my friends and family this as well. However, the difference I am trying to point out is that a new user does not need to immediately go down this path if they choose not to. Whenever I tell a friend about Bitcoin I point them to my favorite wallet, give them $15 in bitcoins, tell them to start with Coinbase if they want more Bitcion, only buy what you're willing to lose, once purchased transfer your coins to a non-coinbase wallet for good practice, and when you have a small savings and are still interested in Bitcoin, lets talk again in a month about trezor and other cold storage devices.
@_date: 2017-05-09 01:35:03
I've tried to reiterate this concept multiple times on this sub and have also got continously down voted. People don't really seem to understand there's people in this world that don't need anything more than a web browser and thus have enough technical knowledge to go to a website and check email. Hard wallets are something to look into after your comfortable with the concept of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:49:53
Can you elaborate? I'm really interested in hearing criticisms for this thought. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:03:31
I do have some serious debt but paying off this credit card wasn't apart of that. Don't really know how being responsible is being  schmuck. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:23:34
I LIKE WHAT U GOT
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:35:31
You know, I used to think like that to and I still mostly agree with you but this event has given me a new perspective. I mean, had I only paid the credit card off this past year I wouldn't have made any profit from Bitcoin. But now, I have almost half the amount left in my savings had I used a traditional savings account and my debt is gone. I'm focusing on paying debt for sure and always pay more than the minimum but at the current return on long term investment in Bitcoin, it's something I'm looking into. I'd love to see if there's a point in time when its more advantageous to invest early in Bitcoin, assuming of course it doesn't fail, versus paying off debts you owe you. I guess I like to be more of a long term guy and only focus on short term when needed. Ultimately I agree with you though which is why I felt the need to sell. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:06:18
Wait, can you clarify what you mean? Having an advantage in mining destroys the incentive of doing what's best for Bitcoin? I'm sorry but I can't agree you if that's what you mean.    
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:22:02
Haha, it's ok. I weighed out all my options before I sold. I almost got a personal loan to combine my CC debt but was worried they wouldn't approve me and my credit score would be dinged. I was basically in a situation where had I not paid one of my cards in a month, I'd have another $500 charged to my account in accumulated interest. I figured either I could keep the bitcoin and maybe(very strong maybe) earn another $500 dollars, or just pay off the debt now and know for sure I would not get charged $500. I guess I'm learning young the dangers of credit.
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:14:21
I'm focusing more on developing Bitcoin versus investing in it but props to you I guess. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:49:34
Hahahahaha, I'm on the exact opposite side. Sold most at $1700 and got locked out of my coinbase account the next day! I've been trying to climb my way back to my old amount ever since!! Nice man. Congrats! 
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:04:59
Tell the average person they don't need a bank account to monitor just even $1,000 in a device smaller then their phone and I can promise they won't understand how let alone belive you. If they don't understand how, why should I go on a long tangent to buy Bitcoins with localbitcoins.com and make sure you buy a trezor first. Bitcoin radically changes the concept of money. Money is a rooted knoweldge many people have not questioned. I think its totally fair and reasonable to tell someone to start on Coinbase, work up a small (small!!!) savings, and lets talk again in a month or two so I can tell you about a proper cold storage. I did, other users did it, and the sky has still not fallen down.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:43:57
I started my job a year ago and accumulated a small amount. I said fuck it, I'll take the 30% tax cut and put it into bitcoin....already made my money back and some.

Thanks for this. This is the most true statement. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:59:03
Very true. Thank you for the edit. Those two sentences are drastically different. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:57:08
Hey there. I'm also no expert but I have been in the space for the last year. What hardware wallet do you have? I own a trezor which is one of the many hardware wallets on in the market right now. With it, you and only you have access to your private keys. Private keys are what's needed to tell other Bitcoin hodlers "Hey, this is my Bitcoin and I can transfer it to you". You never want to share your private keys with anyone else nor do you want a wallet with a company/software that can also access your keys. They, like everyone, can be hacked and the less people that have your keys the less chance your wallet can be hacked. What do you mean when you say you have your "wallet.dat file backed up in multiple locations"? If its encrypted I'd have to research how safe that is. Generally, anything that opens your wallet (private keys, seeds, etc.) should be saved offline, never digitally. When you hear someone reference a "cold storage", it means their hardware and keys are completely offline. It's only when they choose to transfer bitcoins they connect to the internet.
No, the hard fork never happened. It's still a possibility but generally its accepted as a horrible move for Bitcoin. Hard forks have the potential to raise serious issues and must be considerably vetted and agreed upon in the Bitcoin community. The hard fork you are referencing was, in my opinion,  an overblown conversation due to gridlock between frustrated developers, miners, and users. Just remember that, as Andreas once told me, "the tech is there. Ignore the drama." Hope this helps! PM me if you have more questions.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:51:24

No, not really looking for that. Thanks for the usual r/Bitcoin snarky comment though.
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:02:51
Oh wow. I knew about halving but didn't think about it the way you put it. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:44:14
Once you figure this out be sure to get your coins off the exchange. Please learn from this. If you don't own your keys you don't own your coins. Best of luck!!!
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:10:59
Well because it was in my 401k. 20%tax if you withdraw early and another 10% if you're less than 59 1/2. But it was a small amount, like less than $2k. I'm 25 and I figured I'm young enough to take that risk.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:00:26
I feel like you could say the same about segwit too though 
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:57:29
How much influence does Vitalik have? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:31:52
Yeah for sure but tbh you could say the same about r/Bitcoin and miners.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:41:33
I believe that's incorrect. To me, their statement read as if Segwit2x or UASF do not have a majority of the hash power within the fist 12 hours of August 1st, then Bitmain will dedicate all their resources to a UAHF. They're telling everyone what they're going to do. It's classic game theory. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:49:49
If you don't mind me asking, what is your opinion of the current situation and how do you think it will pan out in the long run? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:15:50
We're in bills now. We made it
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:14:27
Thank you for this. This is on my to do list tomorrow. I had no idea. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:04:54
So true. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:44:57
Naw. I asked the same thing recently and was promptly shut down lol
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:36:31
Which is why we should raise the block sizr limit, no? Furthermore, on technical reasoning, Bitmains most recent statement seems well thought out. They're planning for the scenario where UASF receives a hash rate in between majority and minority, which can be dangerous. They even showed their game theory functions. What are your thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:22:41
Hahaha seriously though!!

This sounds wrong....
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:00:45
Think it about bro. If you wanted to, you can always find a way to download music and movies for free? If the government can't stop music piracy, how do you expect them to stop  a global currency?  
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:27:45
But should we allow patents in the Bitcoin ecosystem in general and why? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:22:49
It won't be like that forever though 
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:04:31
Don't worry about it. Consider it hazing haha. Just buy in small amounts and never invest what you cannot afford to lose. If you start worrying about the price of Bitcoin you probably have invested too much. You'd be surprised by how much $25 every other week will get you in one year when you compare it to $25 every other week in a savings account. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 05:24:47
Be careful man. You're assuming it will continue to just grow at that rate. For sure ethereum will be huge but crashes do come and go. Ethereum is young but not invincible. Remember, by your logic if ethereum decreases by $250 you've lost big time. Bitcoin laughes at $250 drops weekly.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:40:08
Ditto. Feels good. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:40:35
Assuming you're correct and it eventually gets passed the examiner, approved, and becomes a patent, what then though? 
@_date: 2017-06-27 22:36:51
No I didn't. ACH. I didn't even know you could use paypal with coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:12:38
Wait....how exactly will the first create higher fees? That literally makes no sense to me. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:43:05
What do you mean? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:45:46
I guess it's debatable but part of the reason 95% was chosen was to ensure a consensus was reached and the network stayed secure after the upgrade. If we lower it to 80%, what's to stop us from lowering it to 70% or even 35%? Miners always need to choose what's in their best interests. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 05:19:23
Definitely helps. Thanks! Never realized the "nasty fact" you pointed out. Has there been any cryptos that have solved this problem? 
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:27:03
Personally? I'm not too worried but I might ask if the amount of testing is enough. Has there been any major problems with segwit on litecoin? Overall criticisms I've read online is that we will still need a blocksize increase, it's a huge change in the protocol, transaction maelibility can be fixed with simpler lines of code, and a blockize increase can compete with segwit in transaction speed, network capacity and fees. On a side note, writing this out made me realize how much more I need to research current technical debates.

Is less miner activation a good thing though?

Hear me out. How would Bitcoin become more centralized? What would prevent miners outside of China to mine? Bitmain has been the 800 lb mining gorilla for a while now and Bitcoin is still more decentralized than all fiat and the second best cyrpto ethereum.

Yeah but I'm pretty sure it enables the creation of ICOs. RSK is supposed to be a rival towards ethereum no?

Also, since you seem to be more informed than I am, could you comment on this article?
 
The fact that it is pending seems not to matter in regards to legal actions and consequences relating to ASICS boost. And while the article states Jihan may actually not even be allowed to use ASICS boost, it's still a technology that can be backed by a government and cripple mining opponents.

They're being sarcastic lol

No need to get frustrated. However, I haven't found any material supporting your claim. From the videos and articles I've read thus far, it's a patent. Do you have a source I can follow up with for your claim? Thanks.

But the problem is that Bitcoin was meant to send millions AND milicents. $1 is a lot to underdeveloped countries.
