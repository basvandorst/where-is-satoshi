I think he did a brave and bold move to buy them all himself. That being said, for me, Bitcoin is a chance to create a decentralized trading platform that changes the architecture of commerce. It is a chance for the 99% to participate in the global economy, not make the 1% that much richer. 
My hope is that this provides a liquidity pool for transactions in the 3rd world. Still Vaurum is a centralized exchange, funded by wealthy VCs that stand to make much wealth... same old story. ... meh....

Hi all- thanks for the comments. But my point was that these rule potentially make this the most surveilled financial system conceivable. Not only are every single one of our transactions known once the blockchain is updated, but conceivably, some solid data mining could tell:
*Instantaneous Net worth
*spending patterns and habits
*monthly spends on specific categories
*the HISTORY of money flows (at an evidentiary level) money trails would be trivial
*taxation could use this
*criminal prosecution could use this
*family law could use this
It would be the end of any financial privacy.

Thanks for engaging on a reasonable level. It is not important that anyone agree, but hurling opinions without any backing seems a fruitless effort. While strong discussion often refines perspectives.
Personally, I see that the Internet was a decentralized communications technology originally designed to function in the case of a catastrophic disruption to the conventional centralized circuit switched communication structure. This is the problem addressed- I am not certain it was designed with a promise aside from this. The Internet we have today is largely the result of a massive capital infusion in technology and services based on the astute observation that the Internet could be extensible far beyond it's original design. One previously unintended result that it is the most widely distributed communications media ever produced. Why do people use it? Well, let's ask the little questions eh? I think it is used because it is pretty and there are cool things on it and it is fun and has utility for recreation, information and communications. It also happens to be a monster business and commerce platform unlike anything else ever made.
Bitcoin solves a number of problems. Like it is low cost funds transfers. It is currently hardly regulated, it is distributed, it permits a low cost way to leverage the Internet as a business platform (as opposed to credit cards.) It has also been a mondo-cool investment opportunity. It is not controlled by governments or banks who have not been fair market participants. Why would people want to use it? I think because while Bitcoin is cool and useful, it ALSO is far extensible far beyond its original design. If it is only a digital currency that is cool but kind of a "meh." But is the blockchain technology is extensible into the very fabric of commerce over the Internet.... then all bets are off and the Internet looks very small compared to the opportunity of Bitcoin.
What is wrong with a sales pitch? How do you think things get sold and business happens? I am absolutely struck by the IDENTICAL mindset of people who were involved in the early Internet to many of the Bitcoin folk today. You speak as though sales is somehow morally deficient? How can that be? The human animal is a social creature (yes, even the coders in a certain way). But fundamental to that humanity is the need to communicate and trade. These are to be embraced as part of our humanity, not disdained as though they were deficient.
I am not talking to the average man. I am drawing a comparison of market criticisms of one giant market in its early stages of adaption to another one. I am talking to innovators and risk capital and saying there is a similar pattern here that is worth investigating. The average man doesn't even get into the game for a long, long time. That is why they stay average. :)
As I have studied market adoption curves- I've realized that markets and fortunes are not driven by the "average business" or the "average man/woman". They are forged in the furnace of entrepreneurship and risk capital. They occur when a person gets into a boat and sails off to find something new. It is those that envision a future and can extend the utility of a platform when most don't and have the tenacity to achieve their vision. If it was obvious, there would be no risk- and equal reward. But the "average person" and "average business" doesn't delve into ambiguity and risk. They huddle over the small flame of the fully known and obvious. They turn up long after all the risk is out of things when they are easy and fun and mechanical.

Dear Mr. Lawsky:
I read a portion of your "rules/regs" today but became so discouraged at the dystopian reality that they represent, I frankly gave up. I do admit it is a shrewd move on your part to ask for so much that when you give some back, that your opponents are fooled into thinking they have a victory. However, it is a classically sophomoric bureaucratic technique. I hope it backfires on you.
Speaking of sophomore, I read this tidy little story in the link at the bottom of the post, as a sophomore in high school. As I read your missive, I was reminded of it. The same tone and value system seem to permeate both documents. Enjoy!

Hey banker- In case you missed the source, these were direct quotes from an interview with Mark Andreessen by Vox.com.
* 
Follow the link and tell Mark yourself that he is mistaken by claiming these things were said. You may want to catch him on Twitter as he is often posting there. If you wish, I could pass it along for you. It is surprising how often he replies back directly.
That being said, I was in investment banking during 1996-2000. And I would say that these are fair comments.
 
@_date: 2014-07-20 04:50:08
so... by your phrasing of the original comment, it sounds as if you have made a judgment prior to any critical evaluation? Definitely not an opinion I am willing to take seriously.... in fact, it sounds like a bit of an underhanded delivery of a negative opinion from a threatened person....

So you are not able to understand the basic market adoption curve of multiple technologies? Contrast them, discuss them, infer potential scenarios, see how they are similar or different (contrast), and grapple with the ambiguity? Really? Wow...
How is that not meaningful when you are trying to plan a business, or fund an operation or determine whether it is a good idea to start accepting Bitcoin this year or next or not at all? How would you decide how to allocate capital for investment in your company or which development choice among the many you will choose? 
If your boss asks you for a market estimate of the average velocity of Bitcoin transactions how would you reply? Would you draw a straight line or an exponential one or a declining one? 
I also never said they would be the same... I made an observation that many criticisms leveled at why the Internet would not be adopted on a broad scale I also hear being leveled toward Bitcoin. I never said anything about my opinion on the adoption rate I anticipate. How did you infer this?
@_date: 2014-07-07 11:04:30
I am talking about market adoption rates and challenges, not technologies. I am not sure why you cannot parse those two things when they often follow the same mathematical model?
@_date: 2014-07-05 09:44:10
I cut out a section of offenses listed... but it is true that Thomas Jefferson preceded Reddit. So TL;DR was not in the original Declaration of Independence. This document was crafted as an edited version of the original so I did not include a TL;DR.

Very simple.
1. Go to GitHub
2. Download the fritzletorgen.js version with the A7XRb fork (BE CAREFUL if you accidentally download the A7XRB fork.... well then you are completely "forked")
3. Install
4. Open Command Line window
5. Create you own random number to use as a "seed" (most people just use their SS
5. Using the random number, run the fritzalate process.
6. After several hours of this, it should be ready.
7. Be careful on step 5, if you make any mistake whatsoever, you will need to re-format your hard drive and reinstall everything. You may also need to do this on your tablets and mobile phones.
*Done* You are now officially "Goxed"

the declaration was an edited version of the US Document. It is not a religious document nor a nationalistic document. Please don't derail the conversation of a global statement of economic independence.
@_date: 2014-07-14 08:37:34
I think that it is pretty well understood that the current global economic system is fragile. And that it is structurally challenged with respect to being robust in times of distress.
What needs to be shown is that Bitcoin resolves part or all of the challenges in the current system. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 02:47:29
If you use any system that is based upon a Counterparty platform it is not possible to hold the funds beyond the settlement date. It is hardcoded into the Counterparty protocol which rides atop the Bitcoin/Blockchain. Once the triggering event has occurred, then the protocol settles automatically. Neither party can access the funds during the time that the transaction is entered into until it is settled.

Great comments! There is clearly a history of individual freedom throughout the entire history of computing. SInce it was the 4th of July- the US celebration of its birth, I was curious how applicable the old document was to the current situation. It was quite surprising...
I especially like your idea of an updated universal document. I would support a document that is tailored to all individuals and not merely those generally considered to be cypherpunk. The statement is that individual dignity and independence has an undeniable economic link and our current global political-economy has become a tyranny in this regard. 
And based upon comments below, would need to avoid any reference to deity (or lack thereof) and any nation lest there be extreme P&amp;M&amp;W (pissing, moaning, and whining.)

It has been fascinating reading the replies to this post. Before dawn in the US, it was reasonably well received. A couple digs for nationalism and God. But hey- it was an American document and I wanted to see how true it remained in today's very distorted measure of freedom.
But when dawn hit the East coast, all the sockpuppets arose and hammered it. I take that as a compliment by the way. It confirms that this hit the bullseye and shows how distorted our politics, freedom and economy has become.
The real irony of it all is that I was motivated to write this based out of an annual 4th of July tradition I have. To read the declaration of independence and recall the commitment to my nation its founders held. 
Now - I find that this same duty of patriotism that once dreamed of being part of the NSA, now compels me to write this document. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 08:59:37
Thanks for the comments. Very useful. I think there is a market niche for:
1. "Trusted, Known" Addresses. Since the limited level of anonymity is provided by an ambiguous relationship of Blockchain addresses to verified identity, there are useful business reasons to be a transparent, verified address to validate BitCoin transactions where legal identity verification is needed. In the Mt. Gox case, having an ambiguous identity has created the possibility of "self-dealing" with no potential to disambiguate the address-identity relationship. A trusted, known address would act as a 3rd party clearing  house to provide testament to a completed transaction between 2 parties. (alternately, you can call up the NSA and ask to borrow their palantir- inference generated address-identity tables- but good luck with that.) 
2. PKI key escrow. PKI is not new and has been around a long time. Governments, militaries,etc.... have used it and have developed a set of protocols and methods to safeguard private PKI keys. While noting is 100% secure, there are ways to manage private keys that minimize the risks at reasonable cost.

It appears that current state-sponsored currencies are not in immediate threat from BitCoin et al. 
It seems to me that BitCoin has very simple advantages for individuals and yes- governments. For individuals, BitCoin offers the lowest transaction fees of any payments system. This is very positive. It also increases the velocity of transactions because of the lower costs. For financial intermediaries, this is bad news. Their margins cannot be artificially inflated anymore. It will be some time before they are under significant pressure. And no doubt, intermediaries will put a full-court press for Regulatory Arbitrage on BitCoin as well to keep their margins artificially inflated.
What is very interesting is the transparency of BitCoin. While it there is no strong linkage between blockchain address and identity, there is a complete record of EVERY transaction for every BitCoin. I'm pretty sure that no currency can offer this. But what governments won't like is that it is public information and they don't have any way of classifying it to obtain informational advantage.
From an economic perspective, I don't see how you put the genie back in the bottle. It simply makes too much economic sense. Why pay more transaction fees when you don't have to? 
So what is the solution if you do not wish to see BitCoin succeed? You cannot compete along the lines of cost- BitCoin buries EVERY intermediated system of payments. Features? Not a chance because BitCoin can already do more for less than standard currencies. On top of this, the technology entrepreneurs have trained their talent and capital on it. This could be trouble for intermediaries and political control of money for governments. So what is left? 
Sadly, FUD. Fear. Uncertainty. Doubt. No small coincidence that there have been several, high profile "problems" with BitCoin exchanges. Then unleash the press to say, "Is Mt. Gox the END of BitCoin?" [note: if writing a $1.2 T bill for the mortgage loan debacle wasn't the end of global finance, how is Mt. Gox the end of a crypto currency that for all practical purposes, has not yet even started? Seriously.] Then - silence. And all the public remembers is that BitCoin = hacked. Nice.
This will be a long term battle... very interesting.
