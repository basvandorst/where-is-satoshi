I get the joke and if cash was not scarce you would literally need a backpack full of cash for some bread although the government recently released new bills with "more value" but they did nothing to stop the inflation so in a few months the story will be the same
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:21:10

Minimum wage venezuelans are not the ones using BTC. Also, most people I know use localbitcoins.com where they buy btc with our local currency and never move it to other wallets so they can sell later when they need the money so they only pay the localbitcoins.com fees and not the network fee
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:27:12
That's why people are starving... The minumum wage was recently increased to around 20$ but in a month or 2 it will be 3$ again. People who earn minimum wage are struggling very bad. They have to wait for hours in line to get cheap food (some food is very cheap but very scarce) or beg the government for a box of food (they give food to some people in exchange of "loyalty") to survive a few more days. Right now a lot of people are just leaving the country because anything is better

Yeah but if people know you have them they can take them or force you to sell the eggs super cheap. Still a good idea but has it's risks
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:21:57
That's exactly what I do. I literally exchange BTC for Bolivares like every 2 days
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:55:19
People still use money but mostly with debit cards or bank transfers but if you have any extra money you have to spend it as soon as possible... Some products, specially food like flour, pasta, sugar and rice can be traded for other suff and for expensive things like cars or phones most are priced in usd but that's only accessible to a very small part of the people
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:39:53
Yeah, hyperinflation is a horrible monster... Imagine the older people that just can't keep up with it because it's very confusing so they save their "money" not realizing how it's becoming worthless. Also we have basically become a cashless society because to pay for a meal in cash you need bags full of cash and the government just can't keep up and print enough because the paper is worth a lot more than the bills themselves. Our highest denomination bill (which is VERY hard to find) can buy you about 4-5 letter sized sheets of paper and the rest of the bills are worth less than 1 sheet of paper
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:45:18
Well from the banks the interests are very low but the amount they lend you is also very low (my credit card limit is the equivalent of 3$) and asking for a loan to get a house, a car or even a cellphone is not possible but big companies are relying on that to continue to exist since they can get bigger loans. Most things can't be bought with credit and if you can find someone to lend you then the loan is in USD and not in Bolivares.
@_date: 2018-06-20 23:04:34
Hahahahahaha wtf...
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:31:32
You could get 1 dollar for 100k Bolivares in january of 2018. Now to get 1 dollar you need 3.2 million Bolivares

A lot of politicians have bitcoin mining operations but not as a government but for their personal profit... They are not interested in ending the economic crisis at all, everything that is happening is going according to their plan. They have talked about using mining operations to help our economy but that's just bullshit. They even have a department who's job is to implement mining projects like farms for public universities and schools to make them self sustainable but not a single project has started
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:47:51
The basic services are super cheap, like ridiculously cheap even for someone who earns 1.5$ a month. Specially electricity and running water. Internet can also be very very cheap if you have the government's company as your ISP, others are also cheap but not as cheap as that one. The thing is that the services don't work very well. Where I live I only get water service for about 6hours a day and sometimes we can last 1 or 2 weeks with no water at all (our house has a water tank so we can store water but most people don't), also electricity in some areas is horrible. Where my inlaws live they only have about 12h of electricity a day. And in some rurals area everything can be worse. Internet is the same case unless you hire a private/corporate internet service. There are still big multinational corporations like mcdonalds, burgerking, pepsi, cocacola, kraft, nestle, p&amp;g to name a few but a lot of them have left and I guess some others will also leave soon (like kellogs that recently left our country after being here for like forever), also even when they are still working, the final product is not the same as if you were in another country because they have to reduce costs so people can buy their stuff and so they don't get their company taken away by the government (yeah, that happens here). I'm doing fine because I invested some money that I earned working in the US in mining equipment but we'll most likely be gone by the next year because I have a small kid and education here is also going to hell and the health conditions are non existant, I also don't want my kid to have to worry about stuff a kid shouldn't. Also, even if you are "doing fine", seeing so many people having a horrible time is something that not everyone can handle
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:48:01
Well I do have to do some shady stuff to get then in the country, like bribing the guys at the customs to let the machines get to me (I have to pay 200$ per asic) but that part is already arranged, I'm just asking around before I pull the trigger
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:00:13
Yeah, I have a lot of family in a situation like that. I try to help them the most I can but it's very hard. Every day I'm thankful for being on the very very small part of venezuelans that have all needs covered comfortably.
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:04:59
I'm not sure what you mean by evangelical but Bitcoin here is a HUGE thing. We're the country in latin america with the most transactions (chile, colombia and argentina also have a lot and a big part of that people are venezuelans who left the country) and considering that 80% of the people are starving that makes it very significant. Also a lot of people have mining equipment because electricity is basically free.
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:30:00
My parents are university profesors (both phd) so the first stage of the crisis did not get to us, we were living comfortably even when things were bad around us (that's around 2008)  but after a while the conditions and salaries started to decrease a lot and by 2014 things were just too much and they left the country. From 2013 to late 2016 was my worst time since I was still studying and me and my brother were living off my parent's venezuelan salary (they both retired so they still got paid even when they were outside the us) and by rough I mean that I could not afford ANYTHING that was not food but I still had that part covered and then in 2016 I decided to go to the US as well to work ilegally in whatever I could find so I spent 6 months making burritos and saved around 3k which I then came back to venezuela and invested that money in some mining equipment which is what's keeping me and my family (I now have a wife and a kid) living in good conditions. It's still scary because we all know how this works and 1 day I can make a lot and the other I could have nothing but we have some savings to flee the country in case mining becomes unprofitable even here (which would mean that mining is dead)
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:19:44
By faaaaar better... When btc was at $20k a btc in Bolivares was 3 billion Bs., now with the btc at $6700 a btc in Bolivares is 17 billion Bs.
Edit: Now after 1 day, it is 19.5 billion Bs for 1 BTC
@_date: 2018-06-21 04:12:22
I was mostly curious because even when everything is fucked up here I'm probably part of the 1% that is not bad at all (basically as good as the situation lets me). I have enough income to support my wife, me and my newborn son, I have a car, a house and I always have food on my table, the thing is that I'm living in a bubble even when a lot of other issues still affect me badly but a lot of people around me are having a horrible time so that information might help some friends.
@_date: 2018-06-21 03:11:55
Electricity is basically free... The cost is so low that saying free is easier. I paid for 4 months of electricity less than 25c (USD cents) and I have some mining equipment.
I wasn't aware there were WoW bots for gold although I do know about venezuelans that work farming gold on runescape and selling it. Any place I can read about it? I do have internet and capable computers lol
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:58:05
Yeah most people have no clue... Next time you see a venezuelan (you will since we are emigrating a looot) you'll know one of the reasons
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:54:27
They actually don't print much and that's why cash is so hard to come by. There are a lot of meassures that can help but it's like the government is not interested in doing ANYTHING that can help because or their anti capitalist/communist ideas, they want people to be poor so they can control them, we are dealing with people that wants us to go deeper
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:33:09
Well the venezuelan government have their own cryptocurrency called Petro which is precisely for that but it's definitely not a good idea to invest on it because only they sell it, you can't trade it in any other exchange
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:42:04
Yeah and the worst part is that our currency already suffered a "reconversion"where they took 3 zeros out because it was ridiculous. If it was our same currency from 10 years ago it would be 17000 billions for 1 btc
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:46:57
They did not raise it... In january the minimum wage was around 5$ a month. I mean, they are always adjusting it but it's always less than the inflation. Last year minimum wage was around 15$ and now it's almost 2$
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:42:50
Absolutely not lol... Not sure why I used that word because it's the exact opposite lol
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:22:35
Very cheap. I have a t9, an l3+ and 12 gpus. Also 3 AC that are on about 12h a day and I paid 2$ for 4 months of electricity so yeah, basically free... The perks of living in a broken country
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:30:07
Venezuelan here. AMA lol
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:51:17
Absolutely, thanks. The only issue I see with that is that at first they have to pay for at least 1 month of wow and the bot which is not very easy when you earn 5$ a month (an average salary here)
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:59:40
The thing is that here almost no one invest in crypto for long term. People sell bitcoins for fiat to buy food mostly and more wealthy people sell them to buy maybe a phone or clothes but basically everyone that sells btc is to expend that fiat almost inmediately unless they are exchanging those btc for usd (it's not rare to see people that have american bank accounts, specially people that were able to travel before the crisis). Here it's common to see a whole family living of the mining profits of an antminer or a few gpus because what a job can pay you here is ridiculous (as an electronic engineer the most I could earn working for a company is around 10-20$ a month)
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:02:25
People have been saying it's too late to invest since the price was like 400$ so we can never know when it's too late
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:37:24
If there are no buyers then the price is not 10k
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:36:32
I don't think that's true. Bitcoin is an asset and getting it requires an investment (mining equipment or straight up buying the btc)
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:30:47
Yeah I don't mind if they ask for id. And I'll be selling btc mostly since I have some equipments mining and want to get some usd in my account instead of buying stuff with btc
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:43:17
I'm just getting started so I'm not selling yet, I have like 50$ in btc lol but I wanted to know about recommendations. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 01:05:50
Well actually cash deposit works too. I didn't even know that was a thing
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:05:45
Most people are not leaving with 10k. They are taking 500$ some family has saved to eat for a few days on wherever country they left to
@_date: 2019-01-26 18:57:56
Can anyone confirm this?
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:28:19
Go to localbitcoins.com and you'll see the actual rate (spoiler alert: it's about 3000 times more), google shows the official rate which is a lie because you can't exchange VEF for USD at that rate anywhere, it's just a lie so the world thinks we're not that bad and our government can say we have the highest minimum wage in latin america (it actually is about 12$ a month)
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:58:43
She got ripped off
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:35:16
Yeah you are lol... The thing is that I don't know how people who make the minimum wage doesn't just starve to death (I make considerably more than the minimum wage) but here around 70-80% of the population make around the minimum wage, maybe 20-30% more than the minimum but still. There are things here that are ridiculously cheap (like gas, electricity, water, cellphone service, internet, etc) but replacing a tire from a car is basically the same as if you were in the us and people are constantly queueing for food because when you do that you can also get food cheap but a VERY limited ammount, if you want to buy food like a civilized human being you have to pay the actual price which is out of reach for most people
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:12:44
And then they print more money while having the same gold reserve reducing the value of all the money in circulation since now each dollar is backed up by less gold
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:47:35
It's like any asset in the world. When you buy a bitcoin is because someone sold it to you, it's not like it was magically created by coinbase (your case), as long as some people are willing to buy and others are willing to sell then the trading will work just fine even if every bitcoin available is already owned by someone.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:03:06
You're either Venezuelan or a liar lol
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:51:50
That's exactly why I sell btc in Venezuela lol
@_date: 2017-09-04 04:05:31
It's worth considerably more than 10$ but not sure how much. Check the 2014 btc price and do the math 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:15:42
I wouldn't invest in something I couldn't afford to lose. It's not like I'm assuming I'll lose it, I just mean that I wouldn't sell my house to invest money. I have invested about a year of work in assets and mining equipment and I know there's a slim chance I can lose it all but there's also a chance I can make a lot
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:56:43
Honestly I have no clue lol
@_date: 2019-09-22 16:27:11
Venezuelan here, the days of 10$ 5 star hotels are gone, we have an inflation both in bolivares and in USD, 2 years ago you could get a nice room for 10$, now you can't get it for less than 50 and most 5 star are over 100$. Coming here as an american, even if you get the visa is not safe at all and with 1000$ you can have nice things but I wouldn't say you would live like a king. Right now with 20$ in a supermarket I can purchase less stuff than my brother in the US while earning hundreds of times more
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:49:16
I would never deposit 5btc in an exchange. Not only hitbtc but any other. You don't own your coins if they are in an exchange.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:47:11
I'm pretty sure that won't happen anytime soon
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:06:06
The worst part is that inflation is actually higher because our economy is so fucked and our media is so polarized that you can get 2 completely different statistics of the same currency by 2 "reputable" sources because meassuring and reporting it accurately is not easy. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:00:19
I can confirm that. Also Venezuelan
@_date: 2017-06-22 05:19:19
Amazon takes btc??? Is that a new thing or I just never noticed?
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:06:52
But steam does take BTC lol
