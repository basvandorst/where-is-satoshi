It took them almost a week to handle the issue, and they apologised and said that with the exchnges they bought they have been overwhelmed with support.
Well unless its been clear that they have been avoiding you I would rather put this on them being overwhelmed with other things. I have never heard of them scamming people.

I lost 5000 bitcoins myself in bitcoinica. I never contemplated suicide but was quite depressed by this and can easilly understand those who are.
There is a french guy that lost his bitcoins in a scam, and it got him very depressed and suicided afterwards. This is really tragic.
If you lost a huge amount I can guarantee you that  after a while things can go better but it can literally take years to swallow a huge loss, whatever the reason. It is especially hard with the never ending rise of the value of cryptocurrencies.
Strangely out of all the advice the one that worked the best for me was accepting that it was my fault, I kept putting the blame on Zhou tong and amir taaki, but then somehow when I shifted the narrative in my head that all this loss was my responsibility it became easier to accept.

You must be under the impression that this is a democracy, while it is in fact a Theymocracy
Its interesting to see how far an obvious [cognitive bias]( can go when nobody can put it a stop. 
All kind of absurd conclusions are reached ("we are brigaded !" "the comment system from reddit is baddly done") when no one can challenge your fallacious premises. 
The problem from reddit is actually that admins are too powerful, not that sorting and voting algorithm have any kind of problem. Thats the same thing as if someone was the president of a country, just because he has been there the longest time.

Actually, yes, if the result was random, the expected payout should be 1.99 or something (2 minus a fee)
However, and you can check it easilly, the prediction rate on 15 minutes is close to 85% (example with one of the players here : 
Thus, the payout of 1.20 can even be a loosing proposition against the best players.
There is a variety of reason why people can have high predictive rate on short timeframe, but the longer the timeframe the less its predictible.
The most probable reason is that they exploit walls and patterns.

btc-e is very shady. 
We ( had customers sending them 1.5+ btc several times because our customers did some mistakes, and they just pocketed the money each time without refunding their customers.
Edit : for details we function like satoshidice on the blockchain, so some users were careless and used their btc-e "wallet". But sending back the funds to the origin address just send the coins back somewhere into btc-e wallet.
They just ignored the tickets on this opened by their customers.

At least thats not the kind of exchange where I would want to trade.

The procotol (colored coin and colorcore) is taking care of sending / receiving coins, and our exchange is taking care of matching the trades.
Regarding dividends, we have not defined a mechanism yet but it will not be hard to implement a specific one. Contact us if you wish to issue dividends.
@_date: 2017-02-25 05:41:40
Well I actually have not checked any specific implementation. I am not a bitcoin developer. I am just saying what I know is theorically possible easilly.
I will agree with you there that for the specific case of signature less IBD segwit feels much more elegant, but I really think there is not much value in signatureless IBD (and anyway, it would still be possible)
If you are willing to go down that path, you might as well use a SPV node which in my opinion offers almost the same amount of security but with much lower requirements.
Regarding the signatureless IBD, again I would much rather have a single merkle tree (rather than two) than a more elegant signatureless IBD
@_date: 2017-02-25 05:34:04
If you remove the signature from the blockchain download (as in : signatureless) it immediatly imply that the serialization string is different from the normal serialisation string (as in : with the signature)
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:01:41
Saying 100% is false. Clearly any code not using the transaction hash or developed on top of a bitcoind (which should be the way most of the code should be, especially for sensitive stuff like business) is not concerned.
Also, with segwit you also need to make potentially major change to your software to handle segwit.
Finally, in a segwit world your non upgraded legacy code is not verifying signatures anymore for segwit tx, so that could be potentialy very dangerous. And you might not notice since thats how a soft fork works.
Still that is by far the best argument I have seen so far against simply changing the hash calculation.

I really dislike the music.
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:01:59
I know that. I think you have not quite understand me.
Lets assume a hypothetical chain of txo A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D
Of course you can spend D at any point without verifiying A's signature.
But you can still be tricked that you got D if the previous signatures were invalid. If A is invalid, so is B then C then D.
Meaning, you are still trusting the miners to verify and validate the signatures of the previous transactions.
Of course all this is pretty safe in practice because you have no reason to assume that the miners are all doing validationless mining, but so is using a SPV node where the security rely on the same assumption.

Obviously Mark is spreading FUD so he can win his bets at btcoracle.com
@_date: 2017-02-25 04:57:46
Thats false. It simply needs any malleability fix which is as simple as removing the cryptographic signature from the hash calculation, which would be completly trivial to add in any hard fork.
@_date: 2017-02-25 05:15:56
It is not hypothetical, since I just described it to you.
And yes, it also allow enables signatureless IBD.

I did skim trought the paper as it seemed to be quite good &amp; serious research. I admit that I only skimed and might have missed a thing or two, but here is what I got from it
They argue that the bottleneck is the bandwith, this is a proposition most people agree with : "Table 2b shows that the cryptographic overheads associated with transaction verification, and disk I/O are unlikely the bottleneck."
Once we focus on the bottleneck, what they say is that if the block size is increased, a proportion of the current nodes would not be able to keep up with the increased bandwith. They decided to choose (somewhat arbitrarly) the ratio of 90% of the current node as an acceptable decentralisation.
So they argue that if we reach 4MB, 10% of the current node would not be able to catch up and would "drop" from the network
The interesting thing is that they also show that if we choose 32MB as the block size, then 50% of the nodes WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP UP. So according to this paper, we can already go to 32MB if we are fine in keeping only half the nodes.
But the beauty of growth is that if we ever reach 32MB, we will probably have around much more users, so we can even estimate the final number of nodes to be higher
TLDR : This paper actually just shown me that 32 MB is quite accessible. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:57:47
Fuck... Wanted to do the same joke :(
@_date: 2017-02-25 05:52:27
Well if you want to spent an UTXO from an old block for which you do not have the inputs signature, you are not verifying the signature. 
At some point if you want to verify that a specific chain of transaction is valid you need the signatures - including the old ones.
Of course you can just trust the miners that the signatures were valid. But thats exactly what a SPV wallet is doing.
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:10:23
Thats true, but as well the benefits are much lower than those of a SPV node.
Anyway thanks for the discussion I am gonna go now. See you around.

Very moderated and neutral article, thats refreshing
@_date: 2016-03-29 19:13:35
Its trivially false.
If there is an average of 900kb in each tx, with 1MB block you only have 100k of transaction to pay to spam the blockchain.
With 2MB blocks, you would need 1100kb. It is thus 11 times harder in thise case to spam the 2MB blocks.
And I am not even talking about the case where the blocks are already full without spam...
Increasing the blocks does not mean that the transactions have to be cheaper for the spammer.

Slightly biased. For example, I think the quote saying that Gavin / Mike and Satoshi are in a disagreement with the vision is clearly false

Disagreed very strongly.
Story time, in 2011 I had only my "unsecured" gamer pc with craploads of warez games. No other computer, no hardware wallet at that time.
As a computer geek, I felt like even printing a paper wallet on that piece of shit was unsecured. Right ?
I felt like it would be thus much better to leave my bitcoins in the hands in the community proclaimed "experts", the "bitcoin consultancy team", with top security hackers and security experts... I name Intersango.
Long story short, I lost all my 5021 bitcoin on bitcoinica. Lesson well learned.
Even a phone is safer than an exchange, look at stats. The main reason being that your crappy computer or phone is not a specific target to anyone. Your architecture does not need to be multi tiered, replicated and complex to handle customer demand. You will not compromise on some point because your support is under water.
Your wallet is not used and accessed 24 / 24. Also, of course, insider theft.
In the meantime, I have seen people use tons of crappy online wallets, phone wallet and node wallet. Myself and others have never been hacked despite using the worst security conditions you can imagine. I am NOT saying that you do should do that, but thats just to put things into perspective.
But please move ASAP to a ledger or trezor wallet if you have any meaningful amount. Or a paper wallet. Dont leave coins in the exchange because you are procrastinating for a never existing "perfect solution".
But whatever you do I feel like exchanges are the WORST solution. For so many reasons.

Sorry but thats not how it happens nowdays.
It is not "You need a fee all miners will accept" but "You need a fee in the highest 1MB of transaction" 
All miners and pools take the biggest tx by fees / byte, and thus you only have to analyse the current mempool to have a good idea of which tx will be included in the next block, and to thus know which fee you need to be included.
There is theorically always a chance of non-rational miner mining based on principle other than the biggest fee / byte but this does not happens in practice

The quadratic time signature problem can be solved very simply in a hardfork with a simple limit on the maximun size to sign.
@_date: 2016-11-20 07:51:56
Right now there is no other working solution in production than scaling onchain, as segwit is doing or as bigger block would do.
Some people also think that the other scaling solution (for example sidechain and lightning) are both : 
* Hypothetical while they are not implemented and testable
* With an unsure timeplan, while demand for bitcoins transaction might increase earlier
In theory they should works but it is truly unsure how they will unfold in practice. The practice part is important, for example decentralised exchanges were once the holy grail of crypto until they were actually implemented and well, nobody uses them for a bunch of issues that I wont go into.
The fact that there is no plan in case of a acceleration of the growth for example the fee reaching 2$ is problematic to some people.
The way the fee market works is pretty simple, the fee is increased until some people or business say "fuck it, I am going to do it another way for this transaction" essentially pushing them out of bitcoin.

So you do not understand that the mempool is supposed to go from 0 to huge in a very short amount of time when the average number of fees broadcasted per block goes from 0.99M to 1.1M ?

Yes its possible to "attack" by getting 50%+ of it. At the same time its possible to "attack" a pow coin by getting 50%+ of the mining.
Its actually way cheaper to attack a PoW coin : taking bitcoin example, buying half the bitcoins would cost 3 billions (which is not even a realistic figure, since the price would go so much up that it would probably cost maybe 50 billions or more)
But taking all of the mining would just require to buy or lend the power to mine several millions worth of coin each day.
And thats the case for most of the coin. Also, a few coin with PoW have been successfully attacked, while it never happened with PoS.

I am against UASF however it sould go even much better than you are arguing if things follow your scenario
If price of old coin is 400$ and the "segwit coin" is 600$, since the difficulty is the same on the 2 chains, the hashrate should go almost universally towards the segwit coin, not be proportionnal
In fact thats one of the reason why I think there is barely any danger to hard forking. UASF is almost a hard fork

This post is so wrong that its really hard to know where to start. I am ready to get downvoted, but if you are interested in actual facts :
1 - This quote is not talking about an alternate coin, but about an alternate implementation of the bitcoin code. He is afraid that with several competing implementations a fork might happens because of a bug, which is of course a horrible situation. This has nothing to do with altcoins....
2 - But on the topic of altcoins, Satoshi actually had an opinion ! 
He created the concept for the very first altcoin (Namecoin) and while doing it he outlined the obvious benefits he saw in using another chain : He thought that piling all concept on a single blockchain was bad because it would be hurting performance, and thus he said that having differents blockchain for different things was certainly a good idea.
So now you can go back to upvoting absolute false statements and downvoting me....

Its still pretty bad by that default the bitcoind raw transaction code considers that "unspent" amount in a transaction are fees, those should always go to the sending address as changes.
Problems keeps happening, its NOT a good default behavior.

Sorry, the question should be printed or stored in a secure device. Better to make several copies against risk of losses as well :)
I have not really thought a lot about how a software would work. I suppose this would need some work to get something good. But yes it could provide a set of some "standard" question like :
 "What was the last name of the first girl you slept with ?"
"What was the name of your first pet ?"
It is of course better to provide a lot of questions and some highly personnal questions, which the software could not think of. It would then offer to print the question or something
And also force some generic salting questions like the one I offered.
@_date: 2015-11-19 10:06:50
Hey man sorry for you. good suggestion. Not sure if it would be safe then however. If you forget just one thing (like a name or date), its always bruteforcable still

Hey thanks !
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:00:30
Well you have to store them in several places (i am confident in my questions so I even use my mail).
But yes, maybe its not really a brainwallet variation but rather a paper wallet variation
@_date: 2015-11-18 18:25:55
Yes but then you have another password to remember again, so you are creating another problem while solving one.

Haha yes gets much harder when you are someone famous. An conscious effort should be made to use things that nobody knows.
I dont think anyone knows the last time she had a diarrhea :)
But STILL, even for Madonna, it can have the strenght of at least a paper wallet : The list of questions should be kept private and stored securely.
@_date: 2015-11-18 17:09:29
Hey thanks for a detailed criticism - its always interesting to exchange point of vue.
You are saying that the information is "easy to rainbow attack" : I disagree.
Do you have a specific example of how you could attack ? Even assuming you found the list of questions.
For example, one of my question is the last name of a girl I randomly met and hooked up with an evening. Only one friend know of it, explain to me how the last name is gonna be "bruteforced" ? There is literaly thousands of last name.
Of course based on probably distribution on the last names or finding the school maybe you could improve your choice on this one, but when you use 15 similar question, there is absolutely no way that you are susceptible to a rainbow attack.
Not more than using random words.
Maybe a couple questions could be bruteforced, but you still would need to have the answers for all the others, and to find the list of questions
The mere fact that you HAVE to find the list of question makes it (in my opinion already) much better than a paper wallet.
But yeah maybe I used some bad questions in the examples : I actually used questions that I thought about a lot in my actually used question wallet. In that case it would be a good suggestion to point such inefficiencies. For example the question on the mark of the cigarette is absolutely bad since there is so few of them and I should probably replace it as an example.
If you have specific criticism (for example the salting might be too small ?) I will totally consider correcting and improving my "algorithm". I am all for taking specific criticism and improving the article based on it
Yeah maybe I used questions too easy. I ll try to correct that
@_date: 2015-11-18 16:10:52
First off, you still have to steal the list of questions to be able to start the attack. In that sense, thats a paper wallet already. No script kiddie could code something to get the paper stored in the vault of my parents.
Then you should use private information. The basic idea is to use VERY private information, meaning information that nobody has especially online.
Yes you should not use information that can be found anywhere online.
The salting could be found, but thats absolutly NOT the point of the salting. The salting is there to protect yourself against blind brute force.
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:12:28
Certainly better than a random generated 20 words list :D
But yes you have to carefuly choose
@_date: 2015-11-18 17:22:45
There is a lot of private information that is almost random. A phone number is random. A birthdate is random. A birthplace is random (though not uniformely distributed) etc.
@_date: 2015-11-18 18:03:20
Well if you don't want to give the "inheritable" property to your wallet, you can use information that only YOU know. Specifically shameful ones. No one knows about that hooker that you saw, and no one knows that you actually had a diarrhea when you canceled your second date with that girl last year.
The thing is, if you want to make it inheritable, you have to use information that some people might know. That's what I used in my example. I mean if you wish for this property, the choice is either giving a paper wallet to your girlfriend, or the question wallet. I don't see how the question wallet would be worse in those specific use case : At least she HAS to ask your friends and family about the answers.
Maybe you can store it in a vault, that's still better if its a question wallet. That's why I like them : I see them as an improved paper wallet, where you need to put less trust on your storing place.
The question now should become : How to choose good question so that even when its found, you stay secure ?
The permutation is actually a really really good suggestion. I am thinking about how to integrate it. Everybody has specific events in their life that are ordered differently.
We are closing the exchange because it was costing us too much time for the money we were winning. We had a good run with it and it was interesting, but now its taking us a lot of time in support and maintenance and its not worth the minimal revenue we get from it.

@_date: 2016-05-28 02:30:26
Were you in charge of the withdrawals for the claims ? Yes you were.
You had access to the wallet ? You let an access that allowed the maximun withdrawal amount with an API key.
The first thing you should have done as a "security expert" should have been to secure and control access to the wallet.
Instead of that your friend "leaked" the sources. How bad is that I dont know but pretty horrible
The only thing I saw you doing during all this clusterfuck was to post ridiculous memes. Please have the decency to shut the fuck up, or at least akwnoledge your partial responsability

Hey thanks for the comment. I agree that "impossible" is maybe too extreme, everything is forgetable in theory.
But in the same way you can forget WHERE you are storing your paper wallet. If you use information thats more memorable than the place where you store your paper wallets, then thats fine. You should use almost unforgetable information anyway.
@_date: 2015-11-22 11:23:07
No its not.
The point is not to be faster than Mysql, just more secure, resilient and easier to develop.

I dont think we can trust the human memory that much, especially to remenber a random set of words.
if you can, then yes I agree its way better but I do not think that everybody can. I would never trust myself with this, I can forget passwords and phone numbers that I used thousands of time several years ago, I dont see how I could be better at it with a random set of words.

Hey maybe I was not explicit enough : What I propose is to actually store the questions, for example on paper.
I see it as a kind of paper wallet where you have to put less trust on the storing place, since if someone finds it he still have to find the answers.

Excellent blog. First time seeing it
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:56:04
Yes my post is neither professionnal nor well written, its venting and based on personnal experience. 
However, as I am running a business I have a duty towards my customers and we are the one as a business suffering from it. We are already looking pretty bad and spent a huge amount of time on XCP, so maybe you can call that the "chain of whining"
Our problem is not just thats its been "clunky" to install, its that it has not been working so far. We installed on 2 fresh unbuntu boxes, and several times on our "withdrawal server" both on unbuntu 12 and 14 and it has never been working.
We of course tried both command lines, APIs, and other weird stuffs, to no aveil. 
Also finally this post got me a ban from the support channel of XCP, so things do not look brigther in the incoming future.
So maybe its a super pro code ultra secure, but using it, it feels like besta testing. I think the usability and stability can be pretty unrelated to the power, cleaness and security of a codebase.

"So I (allegedly) sybil attacked their forum until they proved my point, some moderation is necessary otherwise chaos."
So you admit that you ABUSED and that you were indeed... moderated. Not censorship then.
I love how you basically admit your responsability with your argument but at the same time you try to play it like you are guilty of nothing
Censorship is banning certain opinions, banning fake accounts to spam is moderation.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:56:17
I can detail other "weird stuff", things like the "send many" script that we were suggested by the development team :
It was based of the API and I see it just has been removed. It was sending nice error message like "error : there has been an error (error code error)"
Maybe they noticed I was referring this and removed it. 
I don't think any business will dare to take a public stand if they have an issue, that would be bad for business. 
Our counterparty market is almost already dead due to those issues so...

Sorry but beyond stealing the fund yourselves, you could hardly have acted worse
You did absolutly nothing to secure the fund, provided plausible deniability for Zhou tong and tried to claim no responsability
You did not even file a police report or anything
I still remenber amir doing hackatons left and right seemingly unconcerned by the theft while I was crying my years of hard work lost in dust
Stop trying to evade any responsability, you were in charge of distributing the payments (so you indeed had access to the funds) and even though you are not guilty of theft you managed the whole situation horribly.
Its even more ridiculous seeng how you were bragging about your insane security skills left and right.
really the best thing to do for you about the whole thing would be to recognise your part of responsability, ask for forgiveness from the vitctims and shut the fuck up
@_date: 2015-11-18 17:34:58
Yes thats probably a relatively bad list in term of entropy. I mean I KNOW its good entropy because I know the answers are quite varied and random (for example I know that the name of my pet is a imaginary name and that I broke my ankle very far from home in a small village), but its probably extremely bad as an example.
To be perfectly honnest I did this list quite fast while the ones I am actually using are much longer and done with much more questions. Quantity actually does matters for entropy, so maybe forcing a longer set of questions and specific topics should be better
Maybe I should use some guidelines : Using a phone number, using names, using places, using dates etc. to diversify the entropy sources
What do you think ?
Anyway thanks for the suggestion I am taking them into account and try to suggest a better guideline in choosing the questions.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:55:02
Yes, that was done on purpose.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:43:32
I don't think you had the same experience as I had. Because its not smooth at all for us, and extremly slow, with or without APIs.
Maybe there is some specific reason for us, I dont know, its not my job to know why but the XCP developer's one.
Also, to be honest, we had almost no issue BEFORE mid-december and the lastest version. It was a bit annoying to install but it was running quite fine. 
It all went downhill afterwards.
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:36:45
Its not true.
We have 4 different completely separate environment : 
One for the web end
One for the deposits
One for the withdrawals
Another for some others stuff
So no, we dont have "all on one server". 
Also, are shell commands intended to "not work" ? Because you have the only client for which they not work.
Maybe you should remove them altogether from the documentation if they are unusable.

I am not and was not a mastercoin investor. Yes my exchange relied on mastercoin for a long time but now the volume is close to 0 and so are my earnings.
I have been pretty critical of mastercoin, especially in private, because as I was having "the mastercoin exchange", I did not want to publicly criticize mastercoin. But anyone having talked with me IRL now how i was standing regarding mastercoin ;)
Anyway thanks for your comment.
And yes, obelisk was a piece of junk and we were running mastercoin tools on it, thats why i am saying that current version of XCP remind me of it :) Because the early version of mastercoin was running on obelisk + mastercoin tools, and it was pretty unusable, so it went away
I have personnal history with bitcoinica / amir (loosing more money to those guys than I ll earn my whole life) so you can say that I am biased regarding him and I ll agree.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:29:46
I think they also do have issue but :
- Each environment is different so there is a huge part of randomness in this
- They are probably much bigger team than us and can dedicate someone full time for administration and maintenance of the environements

Nice digging but this is completly unrelated. 
This was 2 years ago+ for another project altogether. Mastercoin did not even exist at that time.

I use a brainwallet with a 16 word password where all the elements refered to my personnal history (name of first girlfriend, nickname of a friend, custom name from our student association, city where i have been in hollidays, game where this friend took me an item etc.)
While largely inferior to a same lenght random password (ofc) in pure term of entropy, it beats any "smart" attack by many many order of magnitude and can allow my familly to recover it if I ever die - while not being vulnerable if a hacker or theft takes its hand on it.
In short : A smartly picked brainwallet can be very efficient, but yes if you are noob I would not suggest it. 
I would still advice 16+ words handpicked brainwallet IF there is like 4-5 words at least which are not in the dictionnary - hence making it almost impossible to attack. Of course all words should be picked separatly, not something from a sentence or have any common theme.
What should be done, some kind of "security check" should be added to online website like brainwallet.org to prevent people to hurt themselves. This is something that should be done. Maybe it should add some random chars to all brainwallet or suggest them "try adding fsdhrtze to your brainwallet", ie some kind of really strong warning should be in place because even the default presentation "horse battery ec." makes it seems like 4 random words is an ok pass.
Because let's face it, all the brainwallets that have been hacked were having really stupid password way below what any smart recommandation would have been.
It is for website, clearly not for bitcoins where people are stacking huge amounts of hash in rainbow tables

Well, we are french and actually everything is in France. 
Right now we were just "testing" the business idea and did not bother much with all the implications, as if you do that you might wait a long time and need a lot of lawyering money to even know in what legal framework you have to set up everything.
As it seems the business idea is sound so far (but we still unsure it is too early yet), we probably will have to think more about all this stuff but anyway thats a risk for us not really for the customer. We would rather move to another country if everything works fine than fight a country that kinda forbid it.
I am not sure if I can expand too much on this topic as as you've said there might be a lot of regulatory issue and maybe making a public statement about any previous knowledge of the law on these is not so smart, but be assured that we will take those issues seriously and try to find some way of dealing around it, even if that means moving in another country.

Hello, I am Emilien from 
Here is my opinion as a victim here :
I personnally lost 5000 bitcoins.
Let me share why I have so many qualms towards the intersango team :
1 - They marketed them as top security expert. History now showed this was absolutely not the case, but this point made me commit to my investment :
Given your history, this page should be wiped out from earth.
2 - They had a total lack of communication while in charge. Zhou never missed an opportunity to explain WTF was going on, while we were hanging out on a dead website for how many month and no feedback from anyone.
3 - They denied any responsibility whatsoever. As long as you were having full access AND were operating the website, whatever the legal papers and the initial state of the security, it was obviously YOUR responsability. Whatever was your relationship with others and all that.
You don't want anymore to be part of it ? Revoke all your access and make a statement. You never did that.
You accept this job / responsability ? Secure all accounts / passwords / access. You obviously don't get the basics of security, which are assuring yourselves that the access are restricted to a very small subset of people (ideally, one person) and that most of the money can't be available at once (small hot wallet or withdrawal limits.)
From the day you have been in charge, this should have been your focus.
4 - They were never sorry for anything. I don't recall any post from any intersango member saying : "We have a very big responsability. We are so sorry for everything." All I heard was : due to the bad nature of the code (Hey, it is not us !!!!) another theft happenned (oh noz, not our fault, lets not precise that we leaked the code source with passwords in it LOLOLOL)
4b - You never answered anything. Never any answers to my mail, nothing.
5 - The infamous leak. Taking the value of the website and the users for your personal feud and for political reasons is beyond madness. How can this move even tried to be justified is beyond me. All you can be about this is sorry and sorry and sorry.
6 - You never ACTED in any way for the creditors. You did not report a theft (how is that possible !), you did not attack zhou or personnaly go after him. Your reputation is stained, take a stand and do something, don't spend your time trying to argue you were doing good. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
6 - You never gave anything. Not even a bitcoin. You are among the worst moral scumbag of the bitcoins world and we are still waiting for anything showing anything else.
Whatever Zhou's responsibility, which might be much bigger than yours but no one knows, he was sorry for everything, never told he was a crack of security, and he showed a lot of pain, true or not. He took 5000 bitcoins and spread them out.
So maybe he is much worse than you in responsability. Maybe he deserve the bigger post. But I don't hear him talking here and there about how he is a bitcoin leader and doing TV interviews.
Sorry but when I hear story about you selling bitcoins all it gives me is murder's idea. Genjix told me repeatedly he does not have a cent to his name but I hear stories here and there that he offer planes ride to his friends and that he sells bitcoin at any opportunity. 9/10 for honesty bro.
Conclusion :
The fact that others might have also huge responsibilities doesn't liberate you of yours. Given the current status, any asset or compagny you have should belong to the bitcoinica users, and I strongly stand by that moral statement. 
One of your biggest "protector" was Nefario, which was managing the biggest scam nest of history.
I lost 5000 bitcoins and went trough my biggest depression ever. You won't get any sympathies from me trying to get your ass out of this mess. 
We see how men are when they are in tough spot. You showed you don't care and just try to fly away from any responsibility. No one should ever give you any meaningful responsibility. Your name is stained.
Maybe roger and his friends were greedy, pressured you etc. Ok thats definitively not cool, but they were missing 24 000 bitcoins. And they don't have any responsibility in this mess. They were just victims. I don't see what could be worse than blaming the victims. Sounds like rapist argument "but they were dressing like whores !". I can totally imagine the mental wreck they were in, we share it.

"Well, you could store the website inside an encrypted truecrypt volume that you need to manually mount, if someone stole the computer, unplugging it would unmount the volume but even that isn't perfect."
Yeah, we actually intend to do that. Just we have not done it yet cause we are still in beta so we have not implemented everything we want to.
"Depends on your meaning of bold - in that we expect to be told to "suck it" when money gets stolen, it is fairly unuasual for someone to say "This is my real name, I will give you money if our website loses it"."
Yes it is, and I think it is something missing in the bitcoin world. I would feel more confident putting money on a website where the owners are known and they are willing to put their name up to the eventual lost. Doesnt mean you could not be scammed, but I have seen so many huge amount of bitcoins stolen by people that hid themself behind Tor &amp; secrecy that it gets ridiculous. I cant believe people can trust shallow anonymous business. Pirate, bitcoin scalper etc...
Of course I could not assure that I garantee the funds if I was doing an exchange and having a immense amount of bitcoins stored, and I would not feel very confident having a business owning such an amount.

The theory was retarded to begin with.
I cant understand why all those "Professor of economics" don't see the obvious syllogism in :
A - The money experience deflation
B - So people hoard instead of spending
C - So nobody use the money
D - So the value of the money drop
D contradicts A. Since A is not an hypothesis but a fact, the only logical conclusion is that the reasonning is false.
I wonder how they can keep again and again coming with this argument without seing how stupid it sounds.

And in case you might think that maybe there is a slight chance of dacoin minister being right in his grand vision, there is now an humble way of buying mastercoins :

As we are trying to have a very low edge so the odds stay good and since we are paying money, we will certainely loose money on 0.01 btc bets so thats why we dont offer them actually.
Maybe we will try using another form of payment for very small amount but we are still using the standard client right now and it is showing a lot of limitations.

Well sorry, of course it was an adverstisement but I am kinda disapointed that everybody seems to know btclevels but not us even thought we have been out there longer and no one complained :)

Am I the only one happy that a massive scammer / thieft is at last being pursued ?
This double standard of "this is a free world so I can steal" but "hehe I am protected by the law so nobody can touch me, beat me or kill me without facing consequences" does not work well together, and is a reason for the massive amounts of scamemrs in the bitcoin world.
So many people want to hurt other ass but they can't do anything, so they can keep scamming and going unpunished forever.
He caused much pain and cries, for me any thieft that face anything is good. So real authority considering bitcoin theft as REAL is good news in my good.
Disclaimer : I did not invest in his fund since it was from my point of vue a obvious ponzi. Argument that investors were too naives (yes, they were) sounds a bit like those arguments with women rapes where it is "their fault" for being too sexy (yes, they probably are).

Hello Ryan,
What are you gonna do about my 5000 bitcoins that your "art friend" stole ?
Oh surely, you have better things to do than helping me with my incredibly depressed mood.

good luck !

Certainely you were able to duplicate the server but were not "operating" anything ? Are you kidding me ?
And your linked excuse for releasing the source, the next time you working at a factory, do you plan on putting a bomb if your boss speak badly to you ?
After everything went to hell you communicated almost nothing and it was very poorly done to say the least. I remenbered VERY clearly you being at some hacker week end in Berlin or something while the first hack just occured and pages and pages of post of people were sad and asking for explanation.
According to all "witnesses" at this event you seemed only slighly worried about the million dollar fuck up you did
@_date: 2013-04-25 10:59:49
Well I know in a theoric world security trough obscurity absolutly sucks. 
I concur it does, but still in the practical world anyone can make mistakes or bugs even when the theory behind is sound so divulging all the information is rarelly a good idea except in a test environment (like in a contest).
Also, the fact that we have security trough obscurity does not mean we cant use other means of security :)
Anyway if anything happens, we will always keep below whats manageable for us as far as we are concerned on our hot wallet and fully reimburse users.
I would much rather loose money than stain my name.

I had money on (5000 btc) bitcoinica, which was hacked because Genjix released the sources with the password in it because you know, he was "unsatisfied" with the management.
Of course there's a whole lot other responsability and possibly insider theft from others people (zhou being suspected as the thief) but trying to flee away from this one is a little big for my taste.
At this level of fuck up there is only two possible strategy : Shutting the fuck up and going far away, or being awfully sorry and trying your best to redeem yourself. It seems like genjix is doing none of those.

Well to be 100% honnest I wanted to say something like "we are doing our best for our security etc." so maybe we should change it back to that as it feel more honnest and maybe less "scamy" ?
I actually think my partner (OP) did rewrite it like that as he is more the "commercial" type than me ;-)
Anyway, I dont believe anything I have done to be PERFECTLY secure. Even when everything is 100% fine on paper, as I said anything can be forgotten or bug. Hell, even your OS can have a 0 day exploit that you could not predict so...
Thanks for the feedback !
Edit : Anyway I am still quite confident in my security skill, just never 100%. This is my master degree and I have done it for big software in the banking world (ie security audit). Still doesnt mean that you cant hack me etc.... as holes are often created from lazyness (using an unclean OS etc.)

Hey nico thanks for your bet !
Hopefully you'll run better next time

So... If I sold something from you in cash and gave you my word etc. but never gave you anything it would be fine if I had NO formal compagny ?
He is not just guilty of lying, he is responsible for a 7 million dollars theft.
@_date: 2013-04-26 07:34:05
It could, I encourage anyone with the skills to do it to try it as any problem should be known as early as possible
@_date: 2013-04-25 11:42:05
I totally agree with you on the security part. As long as we are living in the "physical" world, nothing is 100% secure. Well bitcoin protocol in itself is as it live in the realm of ideas :)
It is not a bold statement if what I have in my hot wallet is less than what I could reimburse. 
I am totally willing to put my name next to that statement right now, and we wont accept more than I am ever willing to loose. Thats part of the reason we limit the bet size right now.
Thanks for the discussion !

Hello there, [BtcOracle]( here !
We are also doings also most of those points, except :
- We are here since 3 months
- Our names are up and front.
Congrats on the nice design &amp; good luck
@_date: 2013-10-26 19:43:31
As someone said, even thougt it is interesting it is security by obfuscation. I would not do it for a serious password, or this could be part of a bigger password.
For example add some personnal information and it is fine.
I think in a practical world this is secure enough, but you don't want to take even a 1% chance that someone could think of it and do that for all books and play and whatever, so dont use something like that !
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:37:28
Thank you sir !

I don't think Amir is a "bad guy", but please dont donate any money to this project.
Just because a video is awesomely produced (I really enjoy watching it, congrats to the producer) does not mean that people behind it are trustworthy.
Amir has a clear responsability in the bitcoinica trainwreck, that left several people that commited their ressources to the bitcoin vision financially crippled.
And now, you want to give him funds and trust him with your bitcoins ?
I can tell you what will happen if things go south, you wont have anybody to turn to.
Of course Amir's responsability is completly shared by Zhou tong and others.
But you are here jumping from project from project, why is your ex partner Patrick Strateman blocking the bitcoinica liquidation ? Can you answer that ? Can you try to help handle that instead of jumping to whichever project sounds the coolest ?
It would be great if we, bitcoinica claimants, could at any point in the future get any closure. We are far from that and all responsible protagonnists have left the sinking ship.
My 2 bitcents.

I totally agree that betting is risky and we don't encourage people to bet more than they can loose. Dont go to the casino with your rent money !
That being said, we are not hiding the fact that this is a gambling site. I still believe this service could be used as a profitable tool for an experienced trader, but probably not for most of the people.
@_date: 2013-04-26 09:48:06
And of course, you have to obey your national law regarding gambling and financial subproduct ;-)

This is good. Nobody should use intersango due to their particular history (bitcoinica...). 
You know they will be the first to leave the ship if things go wrong.

Very good feedback, thanks very much for your input. We will look into every point and see what we can do about it :)

I see 3 good arguments to justify gambling :
First, the thrill and fun of it. Most distraction cost money, are aimed at providing emotions and feelings like a good movie, and clearly gambling provides that.
Second, the  "I need 150$ to buy this item but I have only 100$".
Finally, and I think much more useful than the previous, the "I got 0.03 bitcoin cause I have been tipped or been given some by a friend but there is no way I would bother setting up a mtgox account, making a expensive international wire and all that stuff just to get back 2$"
Getting rid of change easily with a low probability of getting something worthwhile is great. I mean, who would not accept to gamble his useless change jar on his desk for potentially much more money in a usable form like a nice pile of dollars bills ?
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:44:36
While 1200$ for an exchange is a joke, most of the features of a exchange could be done in a couple of month by a couple of geeks, so 1m$+ quotes are really unrealistic as well.
100k$ is a more fair estimate, and that include a good front end designer.
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:54:27
Actually since there is 3 hours between the actual bet and the payout, we have plenty of time to be safe from double spend.
But we encourage any user to try a double spend as the site is in beta :) 
We would appreciate if you could send the bitcoin back if it ever bug thought xDDD
