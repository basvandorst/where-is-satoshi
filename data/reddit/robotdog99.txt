interesting angle .. or maybe this 'giveaway' is itself a way to launder the earlier stolen BTC? i.e. he 'randomly' chooses an associate to give the coins to.

Planet was fine 4.5 billion years ago when it was just a churning mass of boiling lava, it won't miss us ;)

it does look like [those 1000 BTC went into that address in 2013]( so unlikely to be related to the finex hack surely?

IMO he's attention whoring. He happened to post a tweet that I reckon was just in anticipation of what Bitstamp might announce at the Bitcoin Conference in Miami (or wherever it is) then shortly after Bitstamp got hacked.

yeah, I'm worried that the reason they're stalling is because they're in serious financial difficulty, and they're right now desperately trying to find investors willing to prop them up. The "moving to secure server" is a smoke screen to buy them time.

Not completely silent, Nejc Kodrič is twittering meaningless statements and unfulfilled promises on twitter. Still seems quite likely that they are bust and trying to secure more funds to cover the losses. 
Like you say though, we don't know, and won't until they either come back online or announce insolvency.
They are currently funded with venture capital I believe. Imagine you are the investor - what would you do right now: A) put in more money to cover the losses and hope to recoup your increased investment even with the severe damage to Bitstamp's reputation that this debacle has caused, or B) demand that Bitstamp close down, and sell their customer's bitcoins to cover your investment.
Any realistic hard-nosed venture capitalist is going to pick option B.

Thankfully they have come back online, panic is over. I'm very relieved that all my funds are safe.
Do you think I was being pessimistic to think that any bitcoin on an exchange that declares bankruptcy is unlikely to be returned to the owners?
I'm not a lawyer, but I was under the impression that bitcoin, being in a legal grey area, isn't protected in the way that fiat would be.

It's a really clumsy and unsophisticated attempt at manipulation. Seems unlikely to be Ver or anyone high-profile behind it, more likely some amateurish PnD group.

Lightning Network dude. If you want LN to succeed, you need to realise how that prospect is undermined by a bitcoin fork which operates with low transaction fees.

Germany has a rule that if you hold an asset for at least a year before selling, then there is no capital gains tax due. However if you hold for less than a year, then you have to pay income tax on the profits.

It helps if you include traffic islands.

It's the rarity and difficulty of forging gold that makes it a logical choice as currency. 
Obviously paper currency began as promissory notes for specific quantities of gold, for convenience.
I might be missing the point you're trying to make though.

Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of bitcoin? You know, cash that can be transmitted to anyone very quickly?
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:25:44
Well That's Funny

Actually it is true that if your dad gives you bitcoins, it is counted as a disposal, just as if he sold them at the current value, and is a taxable event liable to capital gains tax (CGT).
Anyway, he's not giving them to you, he is selling them. Regardless, due to the tax rules in the UK, he would pay no tax if he bought the same amount of bitcoin on the day that he gave them to you (and at the same price). 
Alternatively he can buy them any time in the following 30 days but CGT would be due if he buys at a different price to what he sells them to you at (if he buys for less than he sells them to you, he would owe CGT on the difference, if he pays more, he would actually be able to count the difference as a loss for CGT purposes). This is a consequence of the "Bed and Breakfast" rule.
Somewhat curiously, it doesn't apply if he buys the bitcoin one or more days before selling it to you - in that case, he would have a tax liability (or a deductible loss) based on the difference in the price you pay him and the average price he paid for all the bitcoin he owned at the time of sale.
