My name is David, I'm the Community Manager here at Xapo. Please allow me to explain. As with any website from which you purchase Bitcoins, we are required to verify your identity. This is an important part of a common process known as “Know Your Customer” (KYC), which prevents unknown individuals from using Bitcoin for illegal activity like money laundering. Xapo asks for the last 4 digits of your social security in order to complete the identity verification process. Xapo is not a lender of currency and you will never be asked to provide your full social security number. We therefore have no interest in, nor could we perform any credit check service or anything like that on any Xapo customer.

Hi Nell
My name is Dave, I'm the Community Manager here at Xapo. This is a valid concern we get from many users. As with any website from which you purchase or transfer Bitcoins, we are required to verify your identity. This is an important part of a common process known as “Know Your Customer” (KYC), which prevents unknown individuals from using Bitcoin for illegal activity like money laundering. Your money is coming in from a faucet, but for any other user, it could be from a variety of legal or otherwise illegal sources. Most importantly, however, is that Xapo only asks for the last 4 digits of your social security in order to complete this identity verification process. Xapo is not a lender of currency and you will never be asked to provide your full social security number. We therefore don't know your SSN, can't perform credit checks, and certainly aren't a threat to the security of your identity. Any other questions, let me know!

We're actually simply incorporated in Hong Kong. Based in USA. The majority of our customers are not necessarily from USA. Bitcoin businesses are very global by nature. With some quick research, you could easily learn more about why incorporating in many places other than USA (especially as it relates to Bitcoin) could be better.
@_date: 2014-12-29 13:50:55
Definitely not! Our customers are from all over the world.

Would you mind clarifying?

We use the last 4 as a unique identifier. It is sufficient information for us to confirm ones identity.

Definitely more the latter there Mitch. Xapo's Compliance team is sending this notice only to older users that hadn't yet completed the verification process, as no one wants to run the risk of not complying with Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer regulations (whether in place now, or soon). I suggest anyone interested in why Bitcoin companies do this have a quick read of a recent Cointelegraph article:

While I couldn't speak to what was going on exactly with the mobile app and your account freezing without more details, significant improvements were made to both the Android and iPhone applications in November, so maybe you haven't tried the latest releases? You should give it another try! We have outstanding reviews in both the App Store and Google Play. Also, as you know, people are really into the debit card, something not offered by other wallets. Any other questions about Xapo, I'm happy to answer!

There is. It's in our "FAQ" section of the website. There is a contact form, or you can reach out directly to support I'm also quite active on Reddit, so feel free to PM me as well and we can go over your eligibility for early access to the debit card (still currently in beta).

True, but the same can be said for a variety of technical limitations in a variety of industries. It'd be like telling Henry Ford in 1900, people will only want his fancy cars until someone invents teleportation (I understand that example is a little extreme, but you get my point). We will continue to supply the most secure means of storing bitcoin, and would naturally adapt in the event that our type of service became obsolete. We also have bitcoin debit cards, buy features, and a variety of other businesses in the works.

As much as I dislike the overuse of the word "disrupting" in today's tech culture, it is, by definition, a disturbance (large or small). Suffice to say, it is causing a disturbance (albeit minor, at this stage) to the way Argentine officials in government are used to doing business. They've had to address it, and therefore, it's disruptive. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:10:05
It's a partnership, that on so many levels, is a massive step in the right direction for bitcoin. The team at Taringa! best explain the struggle they continuously faced trying to affordably pay users, across many countries, many of which have a poor financial infrastructure. Simply put, it was not possible until bitcoin. This is one of many real world solutions bitcoin will provide.

If you don't want to be remembered, then alternatively, we have to send you a code to log-in (like I said, we don't disable 2FA). If you don't whitelist, you get a code, unless you set-up 2FA via Authy, or Authenticator. No, unfortunately you cannot pick the exact amount of days you choose to whitelist. We've never been requested that feature as far as I know, but i'll make a note to see if this is a practical feature worth implementing.

That's correct. Edited my post.

I will remind those, the card still is in beta, and by pre-ordering the card, you're essentially joining the team of beta testers. We were aware of the issue you were facing, CEO-011, and apologize, but we continue to improve the program daily, and these issues can happen for a product still in beta. As you can see though, we promptly resolved this issue.
@_date: 2015-04-29 20:04:54
If selling bitcoin in your country is hard, and you have BTC income, definitely consider the card if often have a need for fiat.

It will create more competitive gamers. Many people love to play, and play very well, but can't justify spending hours on video games without a tinge of guilt. Bring bitcoin into the picture, and you'll naturally see more would-be gamers getting involved in the competitive gaming industry.

It's not a "pre-paid" card. Xapo debits your main wallet's BTC balance, and converts it to local currency at the POS in real time. He is right, I do see a lot of misinformation on the cards.
@_date: 2015-04-16 14:26:38
Hey nter, First, I apologize that support didn't get back to you. Know that you're not the first to mention your discomfort with our identity verification process, and I understand your position. I'll avoid sounding like a broken record as I have throughout Reddit, and instead encourage people to check out the FAQ about identity verification. In short, it's regulatory. It's a requirement, and failure to comply, would put us in a very bad position. Comparing Xapo to Changetip from a KYC perspective isn't fair, as we provide a very different service, and are at more risk from an AML perspective. To answer your question, "We are unable to verify your device", is related to your second factor code. We discourage people from using SMS for second factor, so if you can, use Authy or Google Authenticator, or the native second factor in our Xapo mobile app (log-in, option, Second Factor). With SMS, you can only attempt 3 times within 15 minutes, with a 60 second wait time in between. If you attempt too many times, and fail, the messaging provider may block your device. I'll direct message for your email if that's the case.
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:55:40
This is the greatest incentive to actually use BTC from a consumer perspective I've seen. I almost made a purchase via Rakuten when it was announced they were accepting BTC, but it was cheaper on Amazon Prime, and 2 day shipping, but $30 off? That cannot be beat.

Yep, the did a little name change shortly before the announcement.

"And of the 27m registered users there are only about 300k active users."
That's wrong. There is usually around 200-300k active users, browsing Taringa! at any given time. Like right now, there are 197k users on Taringa! To call those registered users not currently on the site "inactive" is simply wrong.

Thanks for your interest in the Xapo debit card. You haven't ordered that card, as we are still operating the beta program on a smaller scale for the Xapo debit card. What you have done, is added your name to the pre-order list, which operates on a first come first serve basis. Usually, if users express great interest in the card, and add $30USD or more worth of bitcoin in their account, we can streamline the process and get your quicker access to the card. Feel free to message me for details.

If it disturbs the status quo, it is, but enforcing new laws that a government creates to collect more taxes (an example of "economic activity") isn't very "disturbing", is it.

Hey AscotV, the card is still in beta, being released on first-come first-serve basis for those who pre-order. Having said that, users with more than $30USD worth of BTC in there wallet and contact me directly, showing greater interest in using the card can usually have a card shipped out in weeks vs. months. Feel free to contact me.

Every point (equivalent to up/down vote in Reddit) is transfer of bits (like tipping, so as you say "in Xapo" not block chain), and almost everyone uses, and will continue to use Taringa!'s reputation system, just like how almost every user on Reddit uses up and down votes, so we're not talking 1%.

Precisely what I just wrote on twitter. The partnership is a massive education on bitcoin to the demographic that needs it most, and has the capacity to understand it.

And those people were not representing Xapo or CEVO.
@_date: 2015-04-16 14:55:09
It was interested users who posted the partnership, CEVO and Xapo, posted once, respectively. There was a giveaway of $21,000 worth of BTC, so naturally there was a lot of people who wanted to share their referral code.
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:51:19
If you don't want to receive the SMS, then set-up second factor alternatively with one of the applications I suggested. We don't allow users to disable second factor. It's one part of many that Xapo takes to ensure ultimate security of ones bitcoin. I think most would agree here, using a wallet without second factor is a not a good idea.

Having a referral system and endorsing people to spam Reddit with their codes are two very different things. In fact, my only comment on this issue would be for users NOT to do this, it is a bit tacky, and we don't encourage it.

That's the idea of the card. We hope someday bitcoin is accept everywhere, until then, the card is a great means of bridging the gap between a wholly bitcoin economy, and our current system. Maybe someday someone not accepting bitcoin will be as uncommon as merchants that don't accept credit cards.

You don't load "money" onto it. It draws funds directly from your Xapo wallet. We have a partnership with Bitwage. We have a lot of debit card users who do get paid in bitcoin. Purchasing bitcoins, and sending them to your wallet is not the same as existing pre-paid, or pre-load, bitcoin debit cards that require you to transfer BTC from another BTC source as needed. This is not the case with Xapo. Also, we, along with coinbase charge 1%. Many who receive a wage in bitcoin pay 0%.

The easiest way to explain it, considering you're on Reddit, would be to compare it to that. There is link karma on Reddit, which is essentially the Revenue Sharing program on Taringa! for content creators. They get paid for posting popular/quality content. Alternatively, users are given a set amount of bits per day to give to others for content they like, essentially like comment karma (up votes) but instead of being an arbitrary reputation system, is now tied to bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:27:48

@_date: 2015-04-17 14:47:54
We get a lot of people puzzled by the 0 balance, failing to realize, it's a bitcoin debit card. You don't hold a fiat balance, your balance is your Xapo wallet balance! As you so well explained, everything happens in real time, the withdraw, transfer, etc. If Denmark used the Euro, your fee would essentially be 0, as I imagine you got the Euro denominated card. Cross over to Germany, and you'll see :)

A huge part of our business is institutional investors, who are attracted to our reputation as a secure bitcoin storage solution, so you don't often hear from their positive experiences using Xapo on places like Reddit.
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:56:25
I see your point, but that's assuming you live in a country with historically stable banking and currency, and have a bank account and debit card with modest fees. This doesn't apply to many users of our debit card though.
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:20:41
Awarding all users with bits to share, and earn through bitcoin integration with Taringa!'s reputation system isn't the half of it, though it will have a very significant impact on Taringa!'s user base using, and learning about bitcoin. Taringa! estimates that top content creators will be able to earn upwards of 5k Argentine pesos a month, or potentially more. That's a pretty standard minimum wage, full-time salary in Argentina.

Consider, if large investors, hedge funds, and institutions trust our security infrastructure, and insurance policy, at the very least, it's worth investigating more about Xapo. Wences, our CEO, comes from a long history of success in financial services, and our security team are some of the brightest people I've met. VC's believe in our business model, and I think that says a lot. I personally keep all my BTC investment in the Xapo Vault, and my everyday BTC in various other wallets.

Xapo remains the only bitcoin debit card that doesn't require preloading the card (like Coinjar). I don't doubt that using a card denominated in your currency makes more sense, but a European resident for example, using Coinjar would have to pay a 3% foreign transaction fee, transfer funds to the card as needed, and pay a 1% "Loading currency onto Swipe fee" for that transfer. When we come out of beta, we hope to expand the card to more currencies.

It's never been that simple for me. Assuming you're talking to a decently intellectual person, they're gonna have tons of questions. It's not unreasonable to ask "where does it come from?", next thing you know, you're deep into explaining hash rates.
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:09:24
Which fees are you referring to? The card is still in beta, but it's sent for free. Monthly fees from MyChoice  (our card provider) are covered 100% by Xapo. If you're referring to a foreign transaction fee, it's competitive with every other debit card provider. We even have the option of EUR, USD, or UK, to provide you more options to avoid foreign transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-03-27 20:22:37
Imagine if the bank had a two way BTC ATM? Deposit cash into bitcoin ATM, and transfer BTC instantly. Tons of options to withdraw to your bank from there, depending on what country you are in. Skips the slow money-exchange part.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:16:25
Again, it depends on which type of users are providing the feedback you read. Our reputation with institutions, and other clients looking for secure storage of large amounts of bitcoin have nothing bad to say about us. Other users are sometimes outraged that they have to provide personal information to withdraw 1$ worth of bitcoin (which is understandable, but also tend to be the people who like to write on forums). The debit card had hiccups upon the initial launch, but we've since reverted to a beta testing phase and the reviews since are tremendous. We also have 4-5 star rating on both or Android and iOS app.
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:41:07
Hey Ethan,
Definitely look into signing up with Bitwage to start. You can theoretically avoid any fees if you're paid in bitcoin via Bitwage, and using your Xapo debit card for your everyday purchases in the currency in which the card is denominated. No banks, no fiat.

So that would explain it, because you signed up literally 3 days before the implementation, so you would have had account access for that short period, without receiving the notice that all the other users did several weeks leading up to Jan-21.

T-mobile obviously took a look at the numbers, and between no chargebacks and low transaction costs, decided that 20% credit was a reasonable promotion. I can't understand why more companies aren't giving back to bitcoin users. If you want widespread adoption, incentive customers to use bitcoin. Kudos to them.
@_date: 2015-03-26 16:09:05
CEO-011 is right in some ways. While the beta release of the card is currently based on a first come first serve basis, there is a long list of users with no BTC in their Xapo account waiting for the card. We want to avoid sending  the card to inactive users, as this IS a beta period, and we require regular activity from our beta users. Funding your account, and reaching out shows your genuine interest. We have a promo for European users who fund their Xapo wallet via wire transfer, but we're pretty flexible over here. If you really want to the card, I'm happy to help you out!

Not yet, but we are constantly working on a solution to this.
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:44:16
You're going to get a lot of opinions from a lot of people on how best to store your bitcoin. On the more technical side, people love to bash online wallets because you don't have access to the private keys, and many people who like bitcoin, like it for its anonymity (and it's a great reason to like bitcoin). 
If you use an online wallet like Xapo, Coinbase, etc, you will be asked to provide the same information you provide a bank (because that's essentially what it is). You trust a bank, though some people do not. You trust an online wallet provider, though some people do not. Not saying one is the better than other. You can argue that a wad of cash in a safety deposit box is pretty safe, but maybe not that practical, and still susceptible to human error (paper wallet). Or you can store a large amount of cash in a Swiss bank account. Safe, but requires trust, and establishing your identity to a third party.
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:19:32
"In fact AMLKYC is completely ineffective if bitcoin takes off with merchants and completes the payment cycle, it only serves to stifle early investment opportunity." 
Absolutely true, but companies have to do their due diligence, regardless of its effectiveness. Call it stupid, but you can take it up with the regulatory bodies making the rules, not the companies complying (who don't want to go to jail or be fined).
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:12:32
It's fair to say that if he wants access (and the resulting responsibility) to his private keys, he may want not want to use a service like ours, but Xapo is very much a wallet provider (a wallet isn't defined by whether you have access to the private keys or not...). Since our Vault is backed by a legally separate insurance company, it's probably more likely he lose a paper wallet than his insured coins not being covered in the off chance something should happen while storing them with Xapo. A lot more money has been lost as a result of irresponsible wallet users than Xapo (which is none, by the way).

We have over a dozen FAQs addressing our insurance, many of which detail how our insurance works, and why captive insurance companies are formed. We're completely transparent with this regard and discuss it openly.

If the issue is related to your Authy 2FA code not working, you can at least access your account by using Xapo's native 2FA in the Xapo mobile app while we investigate any possible issues with Authy's integration. (Log-in to the mobile app, select "Second Factor" from the options menu).
So I can pull up your account information, you'll have to send me a message. Hope we can resolve this for you quickly.

ninjalong, I'm happy to help, will get in touch.

The amount is no excuse to not pay you, so my offer to make things right stands. You provide details of what happened, and send me evidence that bits are owed to you, and you get rightfully paid. Other option, you don't provide me with this evidence, and you can acknowledge that Xapo hasn't done anything wrong. I'm happy with both outcomes.

There is no longer any fee for our insurance. If you store your coins in our Vault, they are legally insured, and protected in the event the coins go missing, or the odd chance Xapo disappears.

It does depend on what kind of bitcoin user you are. We're the only provider of deep cold vault storage, backed by insurance, and a bitcoin debit card that doesn't require pre-loading. A lot of our users are grateful for these.

This isn't the first post I've seen like this today, and reiterates the fact that education is key. I'm yet to meet someone who after after a solid 40 minutes of accurate bitcoin education (whether watching this, or reading the first couple chapters of a good bitcoin book), doesn't get excited. Sure, according to Coindesk, about 63% of Americans know what bitcoin is (but it's more like have heard of it), but only a fraction of those people can explain why it's revolutionary.

How come more people aren't showing interest in BTC gift cards. Not gyft, but literally a gift card, with BTC loaded on it. Xapo has them (they're not widely available, but conceptually speaking), and if you're from the USA and provide true information, your ID verification is instant in most cases. You'd instantly have a bitcoin wallet loaded with the denomination of the gift card you bought. This isn't a solution for you today, but could be in the near future.

The reception has been very positive lately. It is still shy of a full launch, but our beta testers are happy with it. You really have nothing to lose out of pre-ordering the card (the $15 order charge is waived while the beta program is underway, and there is no monthly fee).

Care to share any reason why you believe someone should not trust Xapo? We've invested more than anyone else into bitcoin security architecture, and businesses and institutional investors are very important clients of ours who continue to trust our services for the most secure means of storing their bitcoin.

Can we send a Changetip somewhere?

Every user who had not yet verified their identity was sent two emails, with over two weeks notice, leading up to the implementation, providing plenty of time to move their funds out should they have wished to do that.

It's certainly not an "all or nothing" deal when it comes to bitcoin compliance. We're hopeful in the very near future that we can differentiate a real threat, from people trying to collect a couple bucks worth of bits on SaruTobi. As most of you know though, bitcoin is so young, and regulations as they apply to businesses dealing with a commodity/currency/whatever the regulatory bodies want to call it/ like bitcoin is sort of all or nothing right now, but we're working towards a solution.

I just wanted to make sure it was known that we weren't talking about that much bitcoin, as most people will respect the time both Fernando and I have spent with someone who slanders Xapo over a few dollars. If you send over any evidence you have to your claim, and your wallet address, I can make sure you're paid what is owed.
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:10:04
Thanks for that. There might be a discrepancy in the info you provided. I sent it to compliance team manually to be rushed. I'm happy to do this for anyone else in verification review, just drop me a line. EDIT: Compliance got to your account. You're good to go!

You don't have to share this information here, but when did you sign-up?

Xapo is the only company to offer a non-preloading bitcoin debit card, that offers a variety of denominations ($, €, £), and links seamlessly with your bitcoin wallet. At least for now.

Could also be interpreted as what requires the most to least amount of responsibility, and technical prowess on your part. Paper wallets can, and are, often lost, and require more extensive knowledge of bitcoin. While D requires you to put your trust in a third party, much like you do a bank, it's not necessarily less "secure", and certainly a lot easier for those new to bitcoin.

In Xapo's latest blog, I point out the chicken-egg situation of bitcoin, that no one wants to use it until volatility eases, and volatility isn't easing until people start actually using it. Only 10% of those holding bitcoins are using it for meaningful transactions, meaning the price is entirely in the hands of speculators. It's not a big deal. We're in bitcoins infancy. What matters is growing interest, merchant adoption, and buzz. It will all fall into place in the next 5-10 years and stabilize. As soon as you accept that, and stop looking at the price everyday, you'll rest easier.

Type your city name slowly, let the Google Maps API detect it, and select it. Disable any adblockers, and your problem should be solved.

I expect people to express frustration about the need to verify their information (which we collect for AML/KYC purposes), but for those who don't understand WHY Xapo requires this, this interview explains well: 
Here is an excerpt from the article for those who'd prefer to complain instead of learning about this real situation all bitcoin companies of our size face.
"If you are referring to AML compliance, they should keep in mind the wisdom of putting an AML compliance program into place. Otherwise, they risk sanctions, including jail time, if they are flagrantly violating the law, and their company is linked to impermissible activity.
@_date: 2015-02-18 15:08:28
That's right. You will need to verify your identification before gaining access to your wallet address. The process is for AML/KYC purposes, and ensures both our businesses and your security. There is tons of information about this on our FAQ page worth reading.
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:55:14
You can almost always solve this by simply logging out and logging back in.

There is no fee to use the Xapo Debit Card. You can order a Xapo card denominated in either EUR, USD, or UK pounds, and as along as your transactions are with the native currency you ordered the card in, there is no fee. If you have a USD denominated Xapo Debit Card, and were to use it in Canada, there is a 3% international transaction fee, not unlike using a Bank of America, Chase, Citi etc. Debit card outside the USA, for example. There is a fee associated with withdrawing funds from an ATM with the Xapo Debit Card, but the intention of the card is for POS transactions.

Curious. I imagine that the government has at least a few bitcoin experts on payroll. It'd be fascinating to see an AMA of one of those guys.
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:28:09
Congrats guys. I haven't yet seen a hardware solution I could personally recommend for those who will never be comfortable not owning their private keys (regardless of ours or any others security architecture), but I'm a fan of what you guys are working on.
@_date: 2015-02-26 14:49:03
David, Community Manager at Xapo here. I want to correct several things OP said. First, we do no freeze funds. If you complete the ID verification, you have full access, if you don't want to, we're happy to transfer them out to another wallet for you. Second, we ask for the last 4 digits of your SSN, not the full SSN. This is a comparatively small amount of information requested for USA users versus other wallets*/exchanges. I know that a lot of users who previously were able to use Xapo anonymously are upset by the move, but as many of you know, financial services operating in the bitcoin space face increasing pressure to comply with laws as they apply to anti-money laundering/terrorist funding/illicit activity. We're constantly working towards a balance between the two.
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:07:37
It's likely just a discrepancy in the information your provided. I will get in touch to see what we can do for you.
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:01:16
R2, Was all the information you provided accurate and correct? I'd be happy to look into this for you.
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:37:18
If you have a legitimate claim to money owed by Xapo, let's chat. I can't think of many circumstances where this would occur, and you're not providing a lot of detail, but regardless; If you're unwilling to work with me towards a resolution, it must not be that important to you, and you shouldn't slander Xapo over it. 
With regards to the card, the launch initially had more fees as set out by the card provider than anticipated, and a discontinuation, followed by a relaunch of service was done shortly after. Since the relaunch, all significant usage fees for the debit card (not credit, as you said) have since been absorbed by Xapo, and customers are unanimously satisfied. I should mention, it's the very first and still only BTC debit card offered in a variety of currencies, with no preloading, linked directly to a bitcoin wallet, so I think it's fair for some flexibility with these type of products upon initial launch, especially when we acknowledge any shortcomings.
