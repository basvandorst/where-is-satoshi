Also the "add mobile phone" option did not work for me.  I live in Thailand so maybe non US countries aren't supported yet?  It kept telling me that my mobile number was "too short".  Lol, yes I was putting in my correct mobile number!  I thought maybe I had to add the country code (even though it was already showing), so I added that in and then it gave the message that the number was "too long".

I think it is great.  Can you add in QR code for the wallet address for the funding step?  Would have made it much easier for me to fund it - as it was I didn't get past the funding step as I couldn't be bothered copying and pasting the address into emails to get it onto my phone.

This is great.  Really wish we get an ATM here in Bangkok soon.  I pay part of my kid's allowance in bitcoin and it would be great for them to see this in action.

I see that StartCom offer free SSL certificates.  I've never used them so can't give any personal experience, however you can read reviews here 
Might be something to help reduce your costs

On first look I thought that on the right side of the illustration it had "DDOS" and then I realized it was DODDS

Unfortunately the buyer doesn't get the opportunity to tell myus what the product is.  Myus act according to the description of the goods provided by the manufacturer / seller.

The best free plugin I've seen yet!

Hmmmmm.  No actual street / location address (just some district in Shenzhen - equivalent of me saying "Soho, NYC".  The phone is a mobile number in China.
Something about "walking like a duck' comes to mind

This is brilliant Acejam.  I just tested it out and it works a dream!  I blogged about it to my friends and family and hopefully they'll sign up for an account. I compared it the ease of signing up for a gmail account - only pointing out that bitmessage is the absolute best method of keeping their correspondence private.
Fingers crossed that you will be just as successful as Gmail!

Please let us know how this plays out.  I also have an account with myus and will change to another provider if they don't deliver this to you.

You are right it is confusing!  The first time I came across it I thought that the website must have read my IP and presented me with prices in Baht (I live in Thailand obviously).  "Everything's so cheap!!!"  I erroneously thought.  I showed my friends who were sitting with me at the time and they were stunned at how 'cheap' everything was too.  I bought some stuff and when I got the bill on my credit card had a real WTF moment.  FYI currently Thai baht exchange rate is about 30 to one USD.

The current version of Armory works fine for me on a machine with plenty of RAM.  However I'm looking forward to the next upgrade anyway.  I have an old laptop with 6GB RAM and Armory will run for a short while on that before crashing.  My current machine has 16GB RAM and Armory runs smoothly, even when I'm working with a couple of VMs open.

Great idea!  If it helps my kids have started a website on cryptocurrencies at 
They haven't done many posts yet, but what they have put up is purely their own stuff.  I have not changed any of their material to insure it is 100% from a kid.
They are part way through their next blog on getting some bitcoins.  I have given them some cash and they have contacted a seller on localbitcoins and arranged a trade in person next weekend.
