She is the FED chairman. Since they are an illegal corrupt private entity working outside the government - printing dollars into infinity, she wouldn't be very happy if their real balance sheet and agenda would become public.

"The possibility of a Bitcoin ETF is once again at the forefront. The SEC is now considering whether to approve a petition filed from global investor VanEck and SolidX Partners Inc. To make the determination, the SEC will meet on August 10, 2018."
I'm kinda curious for the announcement the SEC will give on Friday.

I didn't read the link you provided. I did read his book. An asset from his point of view is something that generates cashflow to your own pocket. A liability generates cashflow out of your own pocket.
He emphasizes to have assets that generate incoming cashflow, equipment tipically does not generate cashflow in itself (unless you rent equipment), so he would consider this a liability.
He also emphasizes that many people misconcieve what is called 'an asset'. He explains this by looking if something considered to be an asset is generating positive or negative cashflow. Is it generating positive cashflow? Then you may have an asset, is it the opposite, you may have a liability.

What a strange move from this man. Why would he do this? He will understand himself that bitcoin is not going to die. Maybe he got offered a shitload of money by central bankers, in return for some negative publicity. Exactly at right moment when also Cryptsy goes bankrupt. I find this very suspicious on several different levels.

They have no choice in participating, at the same they are digging their own graves. Really nice development!

This is a really nice book to read for global description of bitcoin. Easy to read, very informative: 
 
Of course Andreas Antonopoulos has written a very nice book published by O'Reilly. Mastering bitcoin is more into the technical part of bitcoin. Andreas shows you with actual examples how bitcoin works. 
Buying these books is not wasted money. I enjoyed them a lot, very useful in trying to understand the underlying technology. Also the books mention potential disruption in different markets.

Hey, I have a question. Once I created a password to encrypt my wallet, is there any possibility to change this password? I only have the option to type in the fake password, after I initially typed in my password. Thank you
