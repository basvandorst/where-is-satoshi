I've used them from the start, and they've been good. I'm mining, using their service has been fast and reliable.

My main concern with bitcoin is that it relies on working computer networks, thus it is not any good for any post-apocalyptic scenario.  In many end games, guns, gold, bottles of vodka, toilet paper may be better.  
As far as servers mining bitcoins, it takes substantial processing power to do this.  I currently have &gt; 1 gigahash/second mining in a pool, and it is returning enough to pay for the incremental cost of the hardware, but I don't think it's gonna return enough for me to quit my day job. 
The pool I'm working with is currently running at greater than 1000 gigahash/second, and judging from the hardware I'm using, that's a substantial number of computers.  Maybe the whole bitcoin thing is a plot to sell HD 6990 graphics cards.
For the Fed,  they are their own worst enemy.  Since the US dollar is a fiat currency, it's instructive to look at what has happened to all the fiat currencies that preceded it.

The process for converting bitcoins into USD isn't very straightforward.   There is, of course, the issue that the bitcoins are limited in number and represent real work, whereas US dollar production is controlled by the US government.  I don't see bitcoins as being a good permanent store of wealth, since it relies on the correct functioning of the internet to exist, however it does not suffer from the hyperinflationary collapse scenario that is the end for fiat currencies.

Where are you gonna plug that stuff in, and how are you going to keep it cool?

Repaying mining hardware - since I had some cards available I'll be even pretty quickly.  I'll probably buy silver or gold bullion next.

Five hours ago it was the middle of the night and I don't believe cavirtex is a 24 hour operation.  
Hopefully their staff can get into work - I saw that the water levels have gone down since the weekend.
