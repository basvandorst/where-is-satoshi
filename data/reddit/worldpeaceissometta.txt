Don’t be such an asshole dude. Why do people on this site harbor so much resentment toward those with fortunate circumstance. My hope is that I can one day give to my own children. Does that make me a dick, does it make my kids entitled? Or is it just how the world works and a ton of people online are obsessed with complaining about It?

Okay- you’re right. What does that mean then?

Did you know: Bitcoin mining consumes less energy per year than a pulsar?

Nobody knows what this comment means but it’s provocative and it gets the people going.

Also, have you considered that your “hard work” might produce lower quality outcomes than my “hard work”? No two people are truly equal, nor is the output of their work. Does not mean they should have less rights or opportunity, but should value contributed not have any input on their social space?

Are you not also picking misaligned situations? Given that your argument is that your problems weigh larger than mine given the lack of money, even if the problems are different? It’s a belief that castigates success as outliers, and argues that all humans should have the exact same situation across all points in their life. There simply is no real world case which can defend your point. Humans and their inherent flaws break the illusion of potential perfect social justice. All we can do is hope for constant correction to get closer to a more ideal outcome.

The concept of “hard work” in this case would require knowing everything about somebody else’s life. All I’ve learned over time is that everybody’s struggle is different. What if I grew up wealthy but with severe mental health issues in myself and those around me? And the “poorer” person grew up with some stability and support, even if they had to do more work at a job in their younger life? Does that make my life easier, or theirs? The truth is that compassion for others is the only truth and the only measuring stick. The world is not black and white. We all empathize with our own problems more than the problems of others- that’s natural.

I would say this is a good sign for the upcoming block halving. We’ll have half of this activity

Literally why?

Literally no. It’s a phenomenon based on currency whose value is derived 1:1 from reserve assets. The same thing would happen with people trading gold instead of fiat, and the same thing would happen if people only held btc without a liquid intermediary

... 
Do you really want to live in a society where people will reproduce and have 0 access to improve their lives? It would be overrun by inequality and you would have a society ruled by hyper intensive resource allocation, and either a massive mob class or else lots and lots of genocide or revolution, depending on who wins the battle.
This is just platitudes supporting platitudes

There’s nothing to say everybody would end up using any single coin. I’m all about digital money but why would authority-issued stable coins have no place in this world? Also, basing all transactions off a single, supply limited reserve asset alone would cause massive economic swings and deflationary spirals
