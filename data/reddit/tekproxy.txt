I'm sorry you can't figure it out bro.

I agree with everything you say about what Bitcoin community needs -- better UI, PoS systems, etc.
However, you're not going to change the minds of scammers, and I don't think you should. We need scam artists and bullshitters to inoculate the community and boost their immune systems. The price of freedom is personal responsibility, and people need to learn that no one is going to save them from stupid mistakes.

I'm appalled and shocked.

While interviewing for one Bitcoin company, the recruiter and I laughed about how no one has any experience. It's a known thing.
For my two cents, the employer I spoke with was more interested in what white papers I read, any related skills and programming languages, and why I was motivated to learn new Bitcoin skills.

You buy from coin base. They assign btc to wallet where they have custodial control. At this point, it's only nominally your money. You need to move it to a wallet only you control or they can lock you out or confiscate your funds.
Your wallet, your money. Not your wallet, not your money.

I understand. I assume the bubble will burst and the price will fall considerably but it'll eventually keep rising because fundamentally Bitcoin has major utility. You can try and time your exit before the drop and buy in at a low point. It takes discipline and luck. Lots of both.

Antpool said they won't, this may be old: 
Check out the other groups that haven't activated yet: 
Seems that some are pretty serious about negotiating about a hard fork before segwit. I'm beginning to doubt it'll be activated.
The only technical complaint I've heard about segwit was that it's complicated. I'd be curious to know if there are others.

If the transition was instant and painless, you're right, it wouldn't mean anything. But, you know it wasn't, right? Cash shortages for weeks, people standing in lines, wasn't always easy to exchange, people died, so on. 
My point was that's a kind of deflation, though temporary, and there are many types of deflation. Some everyone agrees are bad, others not so much, and it's important to be careful when discussing.

Your bitcoins aren't really moved anywhere, they're just effectively reassigned to some other private key. Technically, when you "send" bitcoin, you create and broadcast a transaction to the bitcoin network which does two things: 1.) proves you can unencumber (spend) some existing bitcoin by proving you have knowledge of the private key (yay math!), and 2.) require that those bitcoins can only be unencumbered by someone with private key corresponding to the destination bitcoin address. 
Super technically, it actually does a bit more, i.e. it has to handle "change". So if you have had only a single transaction to a wallet, say, 1 BTC, and you send 0.7 BTC to someone, the transaction will say "take this one input, give 0.7 of it to destination address, and give the 0.3 change back to a NEW address generated from my private key". This is only the most simple case. Realistically, the transaction may have to aggregate several smaller inputs to get the target BTC amount.
The more complex the transaction (e.g. many small inputs), the more bytes required. Transaction fees are based on transaction BYTE sizes, not BTC amounts. This is because eventually the transaction will be stored on the blockchain forever by miners and node maintainers, and this understandably has a cost because hard drive space is a "scarce resource" (i.e. not limitless).
Once the transaction is broadcasted to the network, it sits in the "mempool" (memory pool) until a miner decides to include it in a block. Transactions have to compete with fees to get included in blocks, so you see the fees change based on demand.
It's so simple it's a wonder more people don't use it! /s

It can be hardware or software. You can have a wallet on your phone. It's just a private key, or a big random number that you keep secret.
If I were you, I'd put my money on my wallet, at least until the forks are done. Also, imho, if you have more than 1k$ or plan on speculating with that much eventually, look into hardware wallets and physical security.

I figured, but why compare to 1 Bitcoin? Precious metals are all similar enough for comparisons like that to make sense. But it's just as valid to compare 0.5 of some digital asset to 10 pounds of rare metal.
I figure a lot of people think like you. It's an easy mistake to make. Free your mind of the psychological attraction to think of bitcoin in terms of "whole Bitcoin". It's trivial to denominate one billionth of a Bitcoin. Long term, money will become a flow.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:52:19
When it's truly mainstream, 1 Bitcoin will be worth 1 Bitcoin.

However you measured rarity is retarded.
Atoms of platinum? Stone? Pounds? Ounces? Kilograms? Milligrams? Decagrams? All equally valid and meaningless.

Not your wallet, not your Bitcoin. 
Hardline approach, sure, but no one said financial sovereignty was easy.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:35:55
In general, I can only trust my own wallet. It's the wild west right now. 
Airbitz might use local wallets, in which case you'd be fine, but I don't know if they do. If it's not your wallet, you have to trust people to not fuck you.

Bitcoin itself is under heavy development
Lightning network may solve a bunch of scaling issues making "actual uses" possible
Here are some LN stores, even though it's not really ready yet
Schnorr signature aggregation and other improvements are constantly being discussed and developed
MimbleWimble fundamentally improves privacy, scalability and fungibility
Side chains is another approach to scaling, and it's not mutually exclusive with other ideas
Atomic swaps open up a world of possibilities by allowing swaps between side chains and block chains. This direction could lead to really potent decentralized exchanges

The main idea behind fixed monetary policies is that purchasing power should *increase* rather than decrease. Simply, this means maybe 0.20 btc buys the laptop in 30 years. In general, if you keep the money supply constant and you have improvements in production efficiencies, cost reduction, new technology, etc. you should have increased purchasing power of the money. Some people call this "deflation" like it's a boogie man because they've been living in an inflationary world for so long, they can't imagine a world where prices go down.
Also, historically, deflation has a bad reputation because every time it shows up it's both large an unexpected. Fixed monetary policy would be small and predictable. Some people argue that "if you get a loan at 10%, paying back that 10% over time has an increased cost because the value of money will be higher later" but I'm pretty sure if everyone can roughly predict deflation and it's not too sharp, you won't have problems, at least not any more than huge, unpredictable inflation.
Not that you asked for a wall of text, so I don't blame you for not reading this far, but there's imho a powerful moral argument against inflation. How is it just for some private group of people to create more money and devalue your savings? How is that even OK? It's only because it's complicated that people aren't pissed off. You're forced to invest in the stock market (i.e. gamble) so your savings aren't worthless when you retire. Not only that, but when the FED creates more money, they give it to their friends so they can spend at pre-inflationary values. Bitcoin is competition the government can't shut down.

The United States federal reserve targets 2% inflation every year. Every 30 years, your money is worth half as much. Bitcoin doesn't have inflation after 21 million. Should be fun to watch competition between fiat and btc.
Now is the wrong time to look for uses. The tech is undeveloped. If you want to follow something, follow the tech.

Global, anyone in the world can participate with a feature phone
Borderless, like the internet
Decentralized, freedom from coercion, shared control
Permission-less, no need to get permission or license or certification to innovate, good ideas win on merit
Trustless, system designed so everyone helps secure network by working in self interest
Censorship resistant, emergent from other properties
Ledger, keeps track of who owns what
Trust network, certain trust functions can be offloaded to Bitcoin, e.g. Banks primary function is to maintain ledger but that can be handled by Bitcoin

Is coin source the name of the app? If it's an app, you're probably not downloading the block chain. Can you link to the transaction?

No one can block segwit. Permission-less innovation. However, no one may use it.
The the knowledge of many minds, working alone or in groups, will discover the value of segwit, i.e. the market will decide.
No one can really say what's going to happen with any confidence, imho, because this shit is without precedent.

Drugs are bad because people are expressing personal freedom over their own bodies in a way I don't approve of. Let's make them all illegal so only criminals will get rich selling them and killing people to protect their turf.
