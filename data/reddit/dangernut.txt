Dollar cost averaging has nothing to do with running a business. It is an investment term. 
This is akin to using the term "penny stock" over and over again as if you are actually following my argument.

Please pay attention. 
You are responding to a comment I made explaining why a *company* would not wish to use *bitcoin* for *commerce* exchange.
What you do in the comfort of your parents' basement has nothing to do with the topic at hand.

Bitcoin is not being used as a currency in any meaningful way.

Overstock has not been doing well. Furthermore WikiLeaks is not a company.

Dollar cost averaging has nothing to do with running a business. 
For example, if I worked for a company based in Japan, providing services in the EU, the value of the Yen in relationship to the Euro will greatly affect my ability to maintain a positive cash flow. Ideally, I would desire that the Yen maintains a weaker position than the Euro as much as possible as for the same cost to the consumer, my income increases. 
This is a very big problem for international commerce as local currencies can fluctuate considerably, though not nearly as violently as bitcoin. 
You are displaying a common problem with this subreddit. You view all potential users of bitcoin to have the same goals and concerns as yourself. 
It doesn't matter what true believers want or desire. You will keep pumping money into the system. Until it is user friendly for commerce, it will remain a fringe use tool. 
This is the whole reason why phone banking in sub-Saharan Africa is so popular compared to crypto-currency. The cost entry point and the ease of use is far superior to the likes of bitcoin.

A company can invest in oil futures...this does not mean that the company is using oil futures to purchase services and goods, funding payroll, etc.
You seem unable to recognize the difference between commodities and currency.

It would be a nightmare to run a company as you propose. 
The transaction time and rapid change in Bitcoin price would be massive negatives.

Coins cannot move. Moment coins move --&gt; bad problems. 
Too difficult to move without panic. Imagine stealing priceless painting without buyer ready. Priceless painting is now worthless. 
Any living person shown to have that much coin at once, market panic and system struggles. People drop out. Impossible to move coins.
