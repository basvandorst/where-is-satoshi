Whitepaper was expected to release this month but it didn't. Gov said they'll release 100million coins first. It's still unkown If it'll be premined or capable of be mined, but those first release of coins are going to be pre-mined, and be sold as an ICO. A website published "leaked" information about it and they said Petro will start on Etherum's blockchain, as a token. Then, they'll migrate to their own blockchain in near future.
That's all I know.

If higher fees could solve this but a fee of $20 might get it stuck for a couple of hours as well.

Why is under attack. It could be all the huge amount of people interested in Bitcoin and buying it.
Which makes sense because this month Bitcoin will be traded in future markets. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:34:50
Next time do re-search.
You maybe didn't even read about how Bitcoin works.
If you dumped all your money here, then I assume you didn't need it all.
So wait a longer time. It has ups and downs. Most likely to go up in the short term.
No one knows the future. But math tells me that Bitcoins is going up soon.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:45:22
Only 21million coins are going to be available. If everyone wants a Bitcoin, it’s obvious it’s going to be worth over 100k. Even more.
That’s all. Also come on it’s been one or two days since last crash and you are already asking if it’s over. How long have you been holding? This is nothing like previous times. To be honest dip was quite big compare to most previous ones, but it restored half of its value faster than other dips. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:25:04
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:00:02
That was not his question. It’s cool If you don’t like Bitcoin.
There’s a lot of reasons for it to grow. Most buyers don’t understand technology behind Blockchain apart of making money quick.
Also most alt solutions are coins that hardly process same amount of transactions like bitcoin so stability problems will happen again at some point for the next coin that holds the first spot. Only coin that can be specially named is Etherum which holds more single tx than any other coin and operates better than any other. That’s thanks to its popularity and all the altcoins that depends on smart contracts to process tx.
Thanks

$5 in Venezuela 2-3 dinners you genius. In India as well, in China probably. $5 latte for your 1st world countries. If you really care about mass adoption you should care about low fee transactions. Said it the guy who doesn't place a foot in latin america and wants to talk about usage. Otherwise, you can prove me wrong. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:48:30
Do you have any technical knowledge of how bitcoin works? You know time between blocks shouldn't be any particlar reason to keep fees high? All I can tell is Bitcoin scaled constantly. 1MB wasn't the initial size for its blocks. If you scale the size of the block it handles a bigger amount of TXs.

@_date: 2018-09-09 20:55:13
Did you even read the OP's topic? It didn't say any solution for low tx fees. He just said Bitcoin should be used for big transactions. Incredible. This forum totally lost it. He apparently stated that Bitcoin is useless as a day to day payment system and only millionares should use it to trasnfer their shit between countries. No, that's not mass adoption there, sir. Mass adoption and utility of Bitcoin depends on people saving and using it everyday. Not to upgrade the size of your pyramid for lambos and dreamy life. You have to bring real use cases and Venezuela is a potential example just as Argentina. If Bitcoin isn't prepared to handle big ammount of transactions, it's fucked.
It's that impressive that even Blockstream knows and its doing LN. Whcih will hardly even work at this point based on all the time they have creating it and all the mess it is right now.
So you are lost compeltely the real use of Bitcoin. I gues KEEP PUMPING IT until it dumps when everyone notices you can't even send $1 to your friend without spending $100 in fees. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:09:53
Yeah I believe it coming from a guy who wants to use on-chain big fees transactions and upvoted a post that stated that we should use fiat instead of bitcoin to spend $5. What a joke. I was the one who mentioned LN in the first place. You are welcome, you learned something new today. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:58:02
And that's how you make no statement, are you all programmed to say "troll" when having no responses? What a waste of space.

This post it’s stupid tbh. Not worth explaining math. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:17:41
Well it's harder for the new user's experience to "experience" money revolution when they have a transaction stuck for almost two days and fees are around $20
Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin but this is too much. I've seen a lot of people mad over 3rd party services because of this. New people won't understand it.
And yet, we still have more transactions coming as Bitcoin becomes mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:05:24
Bitcoin is backed by people's demand.
It does not depend on dollars price to go up.
You can buy BTC with whatever the seller and the buyer agree to change.
If they hold Bitcoin, that's the value. Not selling it.
If people is no selling, and there's demand, price goes up.
Smaller the amount available to sell, the higher price gets.
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:36:47
Read the whitepaper again and ask yourself how that was not the real purpose.
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:44:09
Please, BTC is worthless If it ever hits mass adoption with fees over $50. Paypal is a clear example, people use it but they hate to. I know perfectly Venezuela economics and If BTC goes over $50 in fees they'll just drop it to hell... in a country you get $15 a month BTC should be designed to handle transactions for low cost. 
And hell yeah, 50,000 USD worth to send to Venezuela? You a narco or what? Give a real use example like sending $100 to venezuelans and I know a lot of people in the country owns a non-venezuela bank account to receive those USD.
BTC should be LOW COST FEES. Stop pretending it shouldn't be. If it ever hits the fees to $50 again, Venezuelans will drop it forever.
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:00:55
Because you doesn't have any knowledge and you only handle it by calling troll like most of this forum. Only cares in pumping the price and doing bad-mainstream memes. You are just a waste of space here and not even useful for the people you apparently defend. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:02:00
That's how it is.
But BTC always goes up.
Worst time was after mtgox hack. It went down from 1k to $400/300.
Stayed there for a long time. Almost a year or two with small increase or decrease.
So maybe BTC sellings are to be kept the long term. Its a risk. Maybe they do sell it when they have profit or exact estimated gains.
But that depends on the company inside operations.
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:39:54
Also you make no f*** sense. I've been in Venezuela one the countries this forum keep using as example for BTC "real adoption" and the salary is no more than $15 a month... so you say "hey let's keep bigger fees because Bitcoin is designed to send millions".
What a NON-SENSE. Apart that it'll make bitcoin unusable in countries like Venezuela (where people own little of money worth in USD) you expect to handle mass adoption having fees over $60? December was a clear example and you know what? It'll get worst If we hit the real stages of "mass adoption".
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:05:30
"Redditor for 3 months" probably bought bitcoin last week. God, what a waste of space you are. Read a little, at least Lighting Network whitepaper or Bitcoin original documents, and get back to try to defend your statements. You are clearly a sad example on how not to get in an argument. You can state whatever you want after this post, it won't change the fact you failed to bring any useful information to defend BTC. Worthless!

That's not it.
They are IP blocking access to the country banks If you are out of Venezuela and try to log in.
Misleading title. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 22:42:43
In this case it’s not security measures, but just blocking access to Venezuelans in other countries to prevent selling bolívares with bank transfers (there’s people from Venezuela living outside that sell/buy USD for Bolivares; this is the biggest black market business since cash is unusable). But there’s just too many ways to keep this business going; for me it’s just simple stupidity from the government. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:41:07
I guess it can, not sure. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 22:39:07
I mean, it’s not good news because the intentions are bad. It shouldn’t be a problem to check your account while you are out of your country.
But they don’t block the account, they just block your IP to prevent you log in.
I own a bank account in the US and I am capable of using it anywhere. Should be the same in this case. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:55:06
I am sure it won’t catch up if it happens this year and you should also know. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 12:59:58
Now wait until there's massive amount of TXs. BTC fees go up to $50 again and the truly powerful tool (sending $1) will be a joke.
@_date: 2018-10-21 00:15:47
LN doesn’t have usage and it’s pumped because test net. This is a fact, you can cry over that all what you want. I would bet you don’t even use it but I don’t care. 90% of users from this board doesn’t know how to setup and the way it works it’s totally a non sense for worldwide adoption. You just need to read the facts and how to set it up to know it’s a complete mess. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 03:31:17
Maybe in a few years If LN is ever ready for mass adoption. Consider this a warning to see BTC fail. Before all this block limit mess propaganda BTC was already accepted as payment method in a few major companies. They droped because it didn't work anymore as payment method. And it still doesn't, BTC fees will rise again when we hit mass adoption phase once more. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 00:12:55
I know how bitcoin works if that helps but I don’t program for it. If you read programmers concepts you’ll see differences with each other everywhere. But it is a fact LN is a system that currently doesn’t work, just for a small group, testing. It will fail, as LN doesn’t use bitcoin original technology and concepts. It is a system over bitcoin original system. And funded by banks. Makes no sense. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:20:26
I'm Venezuela, and there's people who own bitcoins like I do. But it's not everyone... it's just popular or starting to be popular as a way to generate money by savings... or people getting others in these pyramid type of business as a solution to generate more money (because most people here NEEDS money due bad economic situations). It's not as popular as the USD anyways, I mean, people from Venezuela buys USD rather than bitcoin. There's still people that does not know much about what an exchange is. Most of the venezuelans do not know BITCOIN yet. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 23:34:04
Because bitcoin doesn’t work anymore for massive adoption, that’s why. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 14:23:51
Bitcoin doesn’t work for payments in the long term otherwise. Fees kill its usage. Only savings and speculation. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 00:20:41
It won’t be friendly as to create a node it requires people to download the full blockchain. It also requieres to have your computer on all day. It also requieres to fund the channel and use all the funds to receive (you can only receive the amount that you used to open channel, no more). All ways to make it friendly requieres 3rd parties. No privacy, you need trust.
Tell me if that’s ok for you based on bitcoin original goals. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 23:49:20
No, because LN isn’t friendly, doesn’t work (read salesman problem), it’s usage it’s low, segwit adoption is stuck at 40%, and you’ll just need to use the shitty liquid system which is centralized and it’s basically a bank. 
If you actually know bitcoin first purpose (decentralize payment system) you’ll see why this is a mess. I will quote jimmy song: “use credit cards”.
@_date: 2018-10-21 00:29:59
As everyone been posting here it is a fact you need to keep the computer on if you have channels open. Otherwise you’ll close the channels. For that you’ll need watchtowers which aren’t done for now. This doesn’t look like a system based on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:03:35
But never went down as low as first dump so it’s “breaking down” but not breaking down at the same time? 
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:02:33
That’s a lie. My facts, I got em reading about it here. I support BTC but LN doesn’t work and it’s not user friendly or system friendly. Not even a middle level computer guy can manage to create a node without proper guide. And no, rerouting it’s not working well. Be honest. LN is unusable at this stage and it will take a long time until it is. So if we ever have a second bull run this year with a lot of activity, BTC will fail to keep fees down. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:04:18
Trying that for what? I open a channel and pay on chain fee to open it. Then, LN pretends I can receive and send but no. I can only send until I have space to receive, but only the same amount I sent as max cap. 
The channel opens directly to open person so I have to pay fee no matter what as original on chain tx. Core fanboys now say you can re-route to pay for more businesses and people, but no. I can’t. A successful Re-routing is 1% chance to happen at this point.
So in a few words you are forcing people to use a system that doesn’t work very well. A system where I have to keep a node open 24/7.
Come one, with what pride you can say to somebody to use LN when it doesn’t work and it is a mess to start using? 
@_date: 2018-06-26 08:34:31
Can’t believe people upvote this kiddo. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 00:10:48

Won't say anything about Petro apart that I won't be buying their ICO. If you need a personal opinion I'm glad to receive a private message. About Maduro approving Bitcoin as option, I think that's ok. I guess its to make Petro easier to adopt and to open exchanges to trade PTR to BTC and other coins. About the last, I'm concerned about that since a couple of months ago. So yeah, If you are holding big amounts of Bitcoin best option is to keep it private. Still, I know a lot of people from Venezuela that are adopting BTC and other coins as savings, but not big amounts. Still, haven't experienced this type of stuff by myself but I know someone who did experience this last year. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:44:56
If you go to a supermarket you’ll hardly find anything. Some supermarkets are ok but with unregulated prices. So for a salary that’s 700k Bsf, the unregulated market settles its value to $4 USD a month.
I just paid $26. But I must say I work with companies outside Venezuela. I can afford dinner like this sometimes. Also there’s still people with money in Venezuela but majority or big part of the country is suffering from economic problems.

I know someone who got extort by gov. security because he owned Bitcoin. It happened a couple of months ago, before all media hype last december.
Not sure what's the plan with Petro. So far its hard to understand what's the long term plan on that.
I don't understand last question. Are you asking If I'm willing to help people to adopt BTC? Maybe I could, but I would prefer to keep low profile for now. As you know, it's a little dangerous, at least here in Venezuela. I'm not holding a lot of money in crypto, anyways. But I guess it depends what's a lot of money for some people.

I know you didn't say it, but a tourist paying almost everything in crypto means mass adoption at least inside the country. You can pay almost nothing with Bitcoin inside Venezuela. Maybe in a couple of months It can be different, I guess. Maybe not just here, but worldwide.

@_date: 2018-07-04 18:44:06
You are saying the truth. Bitcoin being used as gold is a big mistake. It does not offer anything new or good that way. It will be replaced by something better if that’s the case. Real utility of bitcoin is transferring money easy fast and cheap. That utility will be lost when market goes up again and transactions start to fill the mempool. The only good thing bitcoin has is their stable mining community which gives bitcoin a descentralized backup of its system. Just wait until other coins grow as much as bitcoin and you’ll see how it ends. Sad but true. Bitcoin should be meant to be used apart of being a saving asset. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 08:16:52

@_date: 2018-02-26 08:39:33
Doesn't mean is advanced. Maybe New Zealand is good with their current economy. Not sure of that. But Venezuela has massive inflation problems, so it makes sense people looking to adopt other solutions.
