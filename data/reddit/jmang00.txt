But a satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin at the moment. You can’t have 0.6 satoshi.
However, it is possible in the future, with consensus, to add smaller units when they are needed

Ok I think I get what you’re saying, but what’s the point of saying 0.6 satoshi when it’s the same as 0.6 bitcoin?
Edit: This is wrong, there not the same. Imagine satoshi like cents.

And satoshi is a second currency. Like $1.00 = 100c, 0.6 btc = 60,000,000 sat

You mean 0.6 bitcoin. A satoshi is 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin.

How to buy in Australia? Coinbase looks okay but you need to give passport/drivers license.

Do you convert it to fiat straight away or do you hodl it?

I’m fairly new, and need clarification.
After the hard fork, did you receive bitcoin AND Bitcoin Cash? Are my coins fine in breadwallet for the segwit fork?

It’s at $93B now, but I think it might of reached $100B when it was over $6k
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:41:48
Has this happened before?
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:22:03
Ok cool, good luck!
