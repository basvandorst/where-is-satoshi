The planned layer 2 solutions will have a much smaller affect on decentralization than any of the layer 1 scaling "solutions".


I feel that you are grouping a large spectrum of opinions of many individuals (a few of which are extreme) that weigh many aspects of a complex ecosystem differently into a homogeneous dissonant opinion of the group.
Conspiracy theories are just a way to make sense of overwhelmingly complex issues because it is easier for the mind just to relax it's filters for one or two unbelievable claims than to balance and keep track of the whole ecosystem and understand it.
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:02:22
If that is the case then seems we will get a better,  well engineered, fully tested  solution on layer 2 if there is indeed more of an incentive.
Layer 2 also has the option of multiple competing solutions, which should make profiteering of little concern. Yes people are going to make money off of layer 2 solutions, but that just means it will be economically sustainable. The whole bitcoin ecosystem is built on the idea of incentivizing honest participation. People profiting off of it's development makes it stronger, not weaker.

Jimmy or the those that would be able to target the server. Armory is designed to run on two machines. One connected to the internet that keep track of your balance and a full copy of the blockchain (watch-only) and an air-gapped computer that keeps your private keys.
To send coins you make a transaction and save it to a flash drive on the watch-only computer. You then take it to the air-gapped computer to sign it and then back to the watch-only to broadcast the signed transaction.

And even with all that, the proof is only as good as Satoshi's opsec was. If somehow his computer ere accessed remotely or physically by an associate they could have all the information to make the claim.
Your last bullet certainly has a learning curve, but assuming it is someone that was an associate, it's not a stretch to believe they have some amount of a background in CS. I do think it will disqualify Wright; nothing I've seen of him gives me the impression he has anything but a basic knowledge and a gift spouting BS. That's plenty to fool the media for a bit, though.
Frankly, anyone who seeks the claim sets off flags for me and raises quite a bit of doubt that the evidence will have to overcome. I don't know that such evidence can exist.

I will not be surprised. I can't decide whether to find that entertaining or annoying.

*Everyone* has the opportunity to plan and make intentional decisions about their finances. Most buy frivolous shit at Walmart and large portions of their income eating and drinking out. Then they play the victim when bills (usually including $100+ cable bill) come. 
Many do not have enough to make it month-to-month- it is even more important for them to plan and intentionally prioritize their spending. The cycle of poverty is hard to escape and some do not have a way out on their own. However, many do have the ability simply by creating and sticking to a budget and making better choices of what to and what not to spend money on.
But we're not just talking about the poor, we are also talking about the middle class who has amassed ridiculous amounts of consumer debt by living beyond their means; means that already afford a lifestyle far greater than most any time and place in all of humanity's existence so far. Lives that could be drastically different if they drove that car a few more years (and then finally replaced it with a previously owned one) and cut out that complete sports package off their cable bill.

You do not need to open a channel with any of the vendors. Once you open a channel with someone you are connected to all the channels that they have opened with people and the channels those people have opened and so on. After a few hops you are connected to thousands of people. Throw in a few large hubs (exchanges, miners, e-commerce sites would all have incentives to maintain large hubs) and you could with a few hops (automatically routed by software) reach millions of people with instant low fee payments.
If someone has an open channel on the network and you have an open channel of the network, there is likely a route to make a transaction between you.

The hash of the previous block is part of the new block.
If the previous block is invalid the new block would be invalid because the previous hash did not match.
If you change the previous hash to match a valid previous hash, the new hash of the new block would change and would not satisfy the Proof of Work requirements (The block hash must start with a certain number of zeros) and would not be a valid block.

Yes, that would be an issue, but that's not how it works. "Locking" your funds probably isn't the most accurate description but will go with it.
If you open a channel with your coffee shop, you are not locking them up with the shop. You are locking them in the lightning network. Your funds are freely spent at the coffee shop or to anyone the coffee shop has a channel open with or anyone that has a channel open with the people the coffee shop has a channel open with... Thow in some major hubs, like exchanges or e-commerce sites and you could be "locked in" to be able to spend to millions of people within a few hops. All of this routing is done automatically.

Jobs/Wozniak already had a successful line of PCs, the Apple ii series, when your story took place. They certainly were part of inventing the PC, though you could argue that others played a role and deserve to share credit. The innovation that Xerox had was the mouse-centric GUI (a desktop)  that lead to Apple developing the Lisa and the Macintosh.
However, when systems become as complex as a computer, the word "inventor" falls a bit short of accurate anyway. With the Macintosh, you definitely have to give Jobs credit for *creating* the first economically viable consumer desktop computer. And you can say he *invented* it in the same sense that Satoshi invented Bitcoin. He shuffled a number of complex ideas from others to create a packaged system that worked.

So, your hardware wallet created a transaction that sent the full balance of it's address(0.004521 BTC) minus a (54.36 sat/B) fee for the miner which was 0.00010382 BTC. That wasn't enough for a miner to select it, so you asked and ViaBTC benevolently included it in a block for the small fee you had offered. So ViaBTC got the 0.00010382 and your coinbase wallet (at address 1GABa1nL...) got the 0.00441718.
Coinbase then created a transaction to spend the balance (0.00441718) to the address you asked it to (19Q5D...) minus a (steep) 381.51 sat/B fee of 0.00085839 and the mystery 0.00003016 BTC to 1M9Rq5b...
First the mystery address. My guess is that maybe you asked to spend the USD value of the balance. Ie there was something like $75.31 and you aske to spend that, but due to a rounding error or price fluctuation it ended up not being the full balance when it converted the units. If that is the case the mystery address should be a new address in your coinbase account and that 0.00003016 BTC is still there. Unfortunately, any fee to transfer it out at the moment is going to be more than the balance.
As to the fee, it's high, but 381.51 sat/B is what I would expect from coinbase which estimate a little higher for a really quick transaction. You can see the current pending transactions on the Bitcoin network and fees they are paying (bidding) to be included [here](
The annoying thing for you as a customer is the sat/WU you saw. That unit is for segwit transactions and doesn't apply to non-segwit transactions. Your 255 byte transaction would have only taken up 57 bytes of the miners 1MB limit so a 0.00021459 BTC fee (~$3.75) would have given you the same bidding power as the 0.00085839 if coinbase had create a segwit transaction.

Because it's a limit everyone who is capable of constructive conversation is aware of.

If it is the iteration that you feel will scale better, go prove it. Though, there is a long way to go before there is even close to enough use to challenge even Bitcoin's blocksize. I suspect a hardfork (or similar mechanism with better safeguards) with an increase and a number of amazing improvements will come to Bitcoin before Bcash blocks grow consistently bigger.

No, it just seems that being able to manipulate the populous and those in power to bail you out is a desirable trait that nature has selected at the moment.
Evolution isn't a god that selects the traits that progress toward some ideal we can rationalize as the best outcome over the long term. Genes are not 'superior' or 'inferior' except in microcosms of existence-- specific situations that give one set of genes a predisposition to survive.
Evolution, that led to us, and the fundamental idea of capitalism is to throw eggs into as many baskets as possible and hope something makes it out of the other side after nature throws a random set of stressors at it. Communism is a practice of predicting the future and deciding which basket to throw your eggs in. You get the right basket and you'll have quite a few more eggs when the dust settles. No one has yet chosen the right basket. 
Like it or not, capitalism is more of a natural flow than communism. Doesn't mean one is better than the other or that one has a natural mandate to exist. There are just more fundamental barriers that existence has in place against communism.
In the end, life itself is a struggle *against* nature. Natural selection is just a mechanism that exists in the blip of unnatural low entropy that will succumb to the heat death of the universe unless life lucks out and finds a way to overcome that natural barrier.
But... maybe this is all just a simulation. :)

Keeping the base layer as accessible as possible and easy to build new layers upon is essential for the longevity of the project because of that. 
Building on top of an open and low barrier multi-billion dollar infrastructure is far more likely to succeed than to compete with it. Tyng to scale on chain like many advocates would be short-sighted, at least at the pace they propose). It would be an opening for new tech to try to replace, rather than improve the global chain. Not that replacing is always undesirable, but for a monetary system it should be infrequent or there will be no confidence in it or the new tech that keeps supplanting it.
Of course, with every new iteration of tech there will likely be teams that attempt both approaches. So, it will really just be the market deciding if the value of supplanting outweighs the economic shift of assets.

It's been a couple years since I have used coinbase. It is likely that your balance is off-chain and only accounted for internally. Your transaction there just became part of their global wallet and was used for someone else's withdrawal. If your balance still says 0.00441718, that is probably what you have in their system and everything on the blockchain past your deposit has nothing to do with your balance. 
It sucks that the fees are so high, but if you are not in a hury they do drop during lower traffic. The price right now is just filling up the demand to move funds. There have been a few run ups like this followed by fees going down to pennies for a transaction. (though coinbase will still probably choose slightll higher fees)

On the surface, it sure seems that way. Anecdotally, the people I know who put a ton of effort into that are not debt free and have very little savings.
There is a lot of subtle spending psychology at play, and it takes a lot of effort to be conscious of any changes to your spending habits. The CC companies know what they are doing and have quite a bit invested in understanding how to manipulate you.
I used to do it, it feels good to open that rebate check. There is a nice little dopamine release that makes you feel like you are winning.

There is the possibility of quantum computers finding addresses with exposed pubkeys, but then we're not talking about brute forcing anymore.

And they don't know the real cost to produce the bucket of ice and high fructose corn syrup they got at the dispenser next to it, nor the long term cost to their health. That is probably more outrageous than a 25% markup on their BTC purchase. Long-term they'll likely be ahead with the BTC.

The lowercase to use for a smaller denomination was, I thought, the strongest argument for using Ƀ for bitcoin.

They force customers to put high fees on their transactions so their coins don't get stuck. Unfortunately, coinbase has not implemented segwit. Without the discount in fees that segwit provides, that sounds to be an accurate miner fee for a quick confirmation.
You should complain to Coinbase and ask why they are behind implementing such a needed feature to save you and the rest of their customers money.
Though really, they don't have much incentive. If the fees are high, fewer withdraw their funds and the balances just stay there under their control. It's short-sighted, but the CEO has shown before that he has an affinity to be short-sighted.

Yeah, he could have just let okcoin out of the contract or renegotiated before it got to the point that they started forging the signatures. I know there are people around here that hold contracts high the highest principal in society, but not all of society shares that value system. The real Bitcoin Jesus would have just parted ways with okcoin because there was still money to be made with the asset and hurting a Bitcoin startup to make a higher personal profit was not worth it. Not doing so is really just an admission he sold it to them for way above market value.

THE LIGHTNING NETWORK WILL BE MUCH CHEAPER AND ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE. Sorry, but you seem to completely gloss over this point.

I'll misplace a decimal point or screw up some mundane detail because I need to get some sleep, but I'll give this a quick go.
If every satoshi were in a separate address and each was transferred to a new address every day for the next 1000 years (far more tx than possible for longer than BTC as we know it will likely survive)
21,000,000,000,000 x 365 x 1,000 = 7.67x10^18 addresses to have been used
There are 2^160 possible addresses
2^160 = 1.46x10^48
7.67x10^18 / 1.46x10^48 = 5.25x10^30
So after 5.25x10^28 guesses, you have a 1% chance of finding one of the used addresses.
To continue the ridiculously conservative estimate lets say someone mass produces an ASIC for ECDSA, dedicates a power plant to the effort, and the cluster guesses 3000 exakeys/sec (1 million million times faster than LBC and far more than would ever be sustained)
That's 9.5x10^25 guesses per year
5.25x10^28 / 9.5x10^25 = 552
After 552 years of guessing there would be a 1% chance of finding one of those used addresses. And there is only a .00027% chance that it would have one of the satoshis in it.
It's not going to happen.
edit: if I'm off somewhere, borrow some orders of magnitude from the number of target addresses and/or guess rate, there is plenty to spare.

I'm not sure I am following well enough to say what is happening. Maybe leave the txid here and we can see a bit more detail. What hardware wallet do you have and what wallet is telling you that you have a balance of 0.00441718?
 One thing that may be confusing you is change is being sent back to you. Say I have a wallet with 2 btc in one address 3 btc in another. I make a transaction to send 4 btc to my friend. What happens is the 2 btc and 3 btc go in as an input and all have to be spent. Anything that is not specified to go to an address goes to the miner as a fee. What my wallet would do is make a transaction that looks something like this:




















**signed by private key A &amp; private key B**

Further some of the evidence (A PGP key) has been proven to have been back dated-- the piece of evidence most valuable to a community such as Satoshi was part of and interacted with.
Maybe he was being extorted, but it was for the tax implication of the sum of bitcoin he had hidden from the government, not for being Satoshi. He, himself, has been sprinkling comments around the internet as hints for more than a year. I would believe that extortionists did it to frame him, but he did the same thing live when he skyped into the conference panel.

Seems more like a guy that wants to get a boat load of funding for his projects because everyone thinks he is Satoshi. It is a brilliant hoax, he can deny it the whole time and many will just believe it all the more.

One of the rules to investing is don't purchase something you do not understand. The general rule of purchasing applies here too, *caveat emptor*.
The biggest variable in mining is the difficulty. Every 2016th block (about 2 weeks) the network adjusts so that the available hashing power will find the next 2016 blocks at an average of 1 every ten minutes. The current round is producing blocks faster than 1 per 10 minutes because a lot of hashing power has been added.
The 2016th block will be found in a  few hours and the network looks like it will adjust difficulty up 17%. So you will get 17% less bitcoins with the same hashing power tomorrow. In 2 weeks it will likely go higher again reducing profits even more.
I don't know any other details about what is standard in these contracts. Are they paying based on the blocks they actual find [edit: and what guarantee do you have they are not making these numbers up to benefit themselves] or based on the theoretical return based on difficulty? Is the price for electricity already build in, or is there a fee for that? If there is an additional cost taken from the mining returns, they will likely be higher than the return before you break even.
I hope you at least followed the other important investing rule-- Don't invest money you can not afford to lose.

Do you understand than many believe liberation and decentralization are not just important but more important than [ridiculously] low fees and central to what Bitcoin has always been?
What you really meant in your first post is "I want to to stick to what it's been **to me**". I'm not saying you are wrong to value that, I'm just saying that what Bitcoin is at it's essence is not cut-and-dry and treating it as such marginalizes the deeply held beliefs held by many, especially a fair number of the core devs and community [cypherpunks] that gave birth to Bitcoin.
It certainly goes the other way as well, but the side that wants to preserve decentralization is also working on technologies to get global transaction volume higher and fees lower. SW is certainly a step toward that, for instance. Sidchains and LN address this and offer ways to choose a little more centralization for the benefit of lower fees than on the main chain.
I reject either extreme: 1MB blocks forever, scale bitcoin to require data centers to be nodes. Fortunately the vast majority of devs are somewhere in the middle, even if they are closer to one side.

No, there aren't shiny buttons or a flat UI... or whatever it is you kids go for there days. I would love to see you try to download the current blockchain with the client that existed while SN was still around, though.
Satoshi left us with a great monolithic client that was the server, wallet, and miner all wrapped up together and depended on cryptographic library maintained by a third party. Taking apart and rebuilding the infrastructure of code responsible for billions of dollars in value takes time.


You clearly have no idea how much brilliance has continued to be poured into the bitcoin code base fixing the problems left by SN (it was only a proof-of-concept with no monetized value when he wrote it) and innovation on top of it to lay the groundwork for a system that can scale globally and accomplish what you quoted from the whitepaper.
To touch on your original post-- 6 years in the perspective of moving from elementary school to graduating is huge. From the perspective of a major paradigm shift in a social construct central the power structure of the globe that has slowly evolved over thousands of years... not so much. These things take time, especially if you take care to do them right. Bitcoin development is not comparable to iPhone development.

Linux servers do not belong in your argument trying to discredit the userbase as a factor. Not many sysadmins install browsers to visit malicious webpages and email clients to click on malicious attachments.
Lets just be clear that neither of us have good numbers to support our case and we are relying on anecdotal correlations to make our point. With that as the foundation, lets look at your number 21%. I would imagine that is a larger portion than the statistics overall. I would also tend to think that that population tends to be a little more well-rounded when it comes to computers and are less likely to do things like click on vacation_pictures.exe. 
Ever seen an attachment to spam that was .bin, .rpm, .deb? I don't know that I ever have. You have a minority target with Linux to begin with, you have a more educated user base to try to trick into running your exploit and what you have left is fragmented between architectures. Your exploit that runs on a particular kernel or desktop environment isn't universal.
It's just not worth it. You need large numbers to exploit for those statistical few to give you what you want. That just dosen't exist at the moment with Linux. Saying this is not a factor is ridiculous.
There is certainly some better security architecture in Linux systems but with a desktop environment, with products from Adobe and Oracle installed, you are open to many of the same vulnerabilities as the typical windows user.

The problem is when talking politics simple becomes masturbatory and you shut off the ears of those who disagree with you. The purpose of bitcoin is to have a choice in the way we interact with our monetary system, rather than be slave to another's ideas.

The power and purpose of bitcoin is that YOU DON'T NEED THEM TO AGREE for you to have the freedom to use it.

There is no "plan" but that beats current CC rates. I could have said 10% of the CC market and .1% fee and maintain the current miner reward. If the other areas of Bitcoin (like user experience) are ironed out, a .1% fees sure would be attractive to well over 10% of CC merchants. OR the reward might not even need to be that high to support the network. All I'm pointing out is that there is quite a lot of room for success, certainly by the time the block reward drops to almost nothing.
The "math" about miner reward does not clearly spell doom and has quite a lot of room for success. Adoption affects the reward and other factors are what will drive adoption.

If the reward drops below the cost of electricity Bitcoin is already done for and it was for reasons other than the reward dropping. If it's "shit I will now only make $40,000 when I thought I would make $100,000", then you mine the $40,000 to only lose $20,000 rather than $80,000.
Either there is hope to recover some of the investment through mining or Bitcoin is finished and worthless. It can't be both.
The mining reward will fall as a result of Bitcoin failing. Not the other way around. There are ways Bitcoin may not manage to succeed, but this is not one of them.

Of note:

"An administrator or exchanger that ... (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter under FinCEN's regulations, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person."

The biggest difference at the moment it the bitcoin network's 20 petahash/sec. The important stuff, like a distributed blockchain and a know set of rules for currency creation are present in them all. The other differences, such as hashing algorithms how many coins will be created, and how they are distributed are things we can (and probably will) argue about with no clear winner. The hashrate building the Bitcoin blockchain represents millions of dollars of investment in creating an infrastructure that secures it from attack.

If Bitcoin survives long enough to see the block reward drop that much, the transaction volume should be quite reasonable and transaction fees should be quite profitable. If the level of economic activity does not increase from today's levels, Bitcoin will die before this is even a problem.
The math you are using (if you really are doing more than just hand waving yourself) has just as much speculation (about hardware costs, transaction volume, the fee rate the market can handle, and other factors) as the math that says it will all work out.
But lets start with some numbers we know, and speculate from there.
Currently Bitcoin is creating a block reward of less than $2,000,000/day which has supported the creation of one of the most secure networks in history. Visa and MC transact over $20,000,000,000/day. Taking just 1% of that market at a tx fee of 1% will support the future network at the same level relative to the level of Hashrate/Dollar.
It all comes down to whether Bitcoin is adopted or not. In reality, compared to other factors, miner reward has no effect on that.

I've only used Bitcoin Armory(linked in my previous comment) for the past couple years. Before that I printed paper wallets using the [source]( from bitaddress.org.
The setup for Armory is a bit more difficult, but (I think) easier to work with when you want to get some of your coins out of cold storage. With a paper wallet if you have say 10BTC at the address and only want to use 1BTC and keep the other 9 in cold storage you sweep all 10 into you client (or online wallet) and then send the 9 back to another paper wallet address.
With armory I create a transaction for 1BTC with my online "watch wallet" save it to a USB drive, stick it in my offline computer sign the transaction, and put to drive back into my online computer to broadcast it. The 9BTC were never exposed to my possibly trojaned online computer or online wallet.

So, what's the obvious reason that makes this so laughable? Is it insolvency and unavoidable bankruptcy? Every time Gox screws up that accusation is shouted everywhere. Every time (so far) that has been shown to be wrong. Gox has pulled in some serious income in that past few years. It would take quite a level of mismanagement to squander the good fortune they have had that even Karpeles can steer clear from. In just the past 2 weeks they've collected at least $600K and 1600BTC in fees. I know those desert-like coffees aren't cheap, but I doubt Karpeles has blown that much money away. He certainly hasn't been spending a lot on employees.

This. There are hardly large operations ready to invest millions in mining an asset that's value has been on a decline for most of it's existence. If Dogecoin begins to be taken seriously that could change. Though I suspect the userbase would need to start taking it seriously first- much unlikely.

How would that not cause a loss of confidence in Bitcoin? A number of small double spends would be easily detected and the statistics would be enough to get articles blaming the pool for being complicit which would shake confidence. A large double spend that is the result of a behind-the-scene fork that orphans enough blocks to attack someone sticking to the advise in OP would certainly be noticed, and definitely would cause problems in the market.
Perhaps one could set up a pool and have nothing invested but the hardware to run the backend (no mining hardware) and could entice enough people to join the pool to get that kind of share of the network. Maybe the short term gains of such a scheme would make it profitable. That's all speculative, though. No large pool has existed that wasn't heavily invested in mining hardware itself. As such, staying honest is much more profitable.

Specifically the security section. It is quite trivial to calculate a reused private key connected with a weak rng. There are people actively running scripts to sweep balances, large and small, out of accounts open to this weakness. You should expect your funds to disappear in minutes if you become vulnerable to this. 
You seem rather uniformed about Bitcoin security practices. That's okay, you're obviously open to new things and learning or you wouldn't be here... but, perhaps you should shy away from gving abvise to people on how to secure their assets. Err on the side of caution rather than giving them the green light if you don't know all there is to know.

The first graph is misleading. The second with a proper scale shows how misleading the first is, or at least begins to. 
For instance, the latest date on the graph. The pretty lines create a "buy" range that is (using my fingers as a straight edge) roughly $300 to $1000. So $700. The Range of the "sell" bands is $1400 to God-only-knows-where-that-red-band-ends-up. Likely a range a order of magnitude higher.
Very imprecise. The low resolution of the log scale hide the inaccuracy and make it look reasonable. Extrapolating using exponential curves and an organic data set with large swings is completely worthless. The slightest deviation (say a sudden jump to $30 early on) from the natural trend (if there is one) introduces large amounts of error.
The results are probably so statistically insignificant to go to the trouble. You should just flip a coin to decide whether to buy or sell.

This is likely just an issue with semantics. It can be used to *verify* the integrity of the data you have and include checkpoints to verify the good and bad parts if something is corrupted.

The evolving terminology makes this thread a bit ambiguous and fitting all our distinctions (Miner, full node, SPV client, and unfortunately SPV miner) cleanly into this discussion is hard. 
Here Satoshi talks of a "network node" which mines and a "client node" that does not. My full node only does transactions (receives, validates, and relays some of the transactions on the network) and does not generate blocks, is it the client node that Satoshi was talking about?
We could probably go deep into the hermeneutics of Satoshi cannon to advise us on the blocksize debate; we could also dig through writings and quotes of Edison to advise current light bulb manufactures.

I'm not giving anything they said credibility. I just noted that the database is consistent with what they said. The database, in no way, suggests that they were lying. That doesn't mean they were telling the truth. Connecting the dots with a bunch of weak evidence is as intellectually responsible as LMG's "journalism".
The 180K BTC are not proven to be from Gox (though it seems quite likely) and that wasn't what we were talking about.
Don't assume people who shoot holes in weak evidence are arguing against the proposed question. I think theft by Gox is quite possible. I just want good evidence to support the accusation.

AND it it clears the way for layer 2 solutions like payment channels which are already in development. There is huge demand and many people dedicated to getting several implementations of LN working. It is a much better scaling solution than just bumping maxblocksize and is going to be ready sooner than you seem to think. Any dynamic block size solution is going to take even longer to implement and test... if it is even possible to do without compromising security.


Correct, but no one is proposing it as a scaling solution. Segwit is just the first big step toward the whole of the scaling roadmap.

Periodic audits. That's the best you are going to do with physical assets and legacy currencies. Having the feature of instant continuous audits on part of the assets is certainly a  step in the right direction. It doesn't make fraud impossible, but it makes it harder to hide.
When we are worried about solvency to carry on business uninterrupted, assets like real estate and depreciated equipment is not really that important anyway. If it's to the point that they have to sell that to carry on, they're probably in a situation that you'll want to jump ship anyway.

I agree and they should only happen if we fail to raise capacity with optimizations and limit the activity to actual economic activity by allowing fees to raise slightly.

Core is rolling out an increase to throughput which is the actual issue blocksize is about.  Simultaneously, they are solving other issues that need to be addressed, like transaction malleability.
After rereading everything you said in this thread, I would say the point you are arguing is technically correct. The spirit in which you make the argument is critical of Core and comes off as if you are arguing that they have done nothing to solve the issue. Those arguing with you are merely pointing out that they are working very hard to solve the issue of throughput, while you are pointing out that they have done nothing about blocksize-- which is a solution (which has it's own trade-offs, but many feel they are worth it), not the issue that needs to be solved.
"Technically correct is the best kind of correct" is not true of social interaction. Small subtleties of our very imperfect language, individual experience and worldviews all make talking about things difficult (especially on the internet) and arguments often tangentially end up arguing about the wrong issue. Like blocksize vs throughput
Originally the narrative from the blocksize-increase side was that the Core devs wanted to limit the throughput (it was phased as "blocksize", but in context clearly means "throughput") to create a fee market. Well, if that was the case they compromised and are moving forward with an increase.
From the need-for-big-blocks-is-not-dire side is seems like the argument has move from "Core wants to limit transactions" to "Core never wants to increase blocksize" to "Core isn't going to increase blocksize soon enough"


But it fundamentally solves (or at least begins to solve) the same issue. You're lack of acknowledging that deafens others to any appeal you make to increase blocksize. Why would they give you more if you are ungrateful for what (they feel) they already have.
Consensus is messy, not because the process is flawed, but because it forces us to step out of our normal way of getting our way that tend to involve systematic dehumanization of the other side in a struggle to outwit and gain public appeal for our side. It's only a long and slow process because of pride and arrogance to give up being right, even about small unimportant details or semantics.

It was certainly a mistake to switch the licence... or at least to change it the way they did and the the specific licence they did. The backlash was deserved, if for no other reason than it showed a lack of foresight to predict of the community would react. 
At any rate, any malice I felt toward their decision has been fixed by this reversal. The move probably had a lot of emotion tied up in it and I can't fault someone for that when, I'm sure, quite a bit of their lives and livelihoods are riding of the success of their project. The SL team members have contributed a good deal to the community over the years, they deserve some grace when it comes to making a mistake, especially when they admit it and fix it so quickly. 
Not that my opinion is worth much to them since I'm not in the market for such a device at the moment, but when I am I WILL buy a SL product over a cheaper knock off.

In my opinion, I would say your sentiment is true (or will need to be true to scale) of layer 1 and the blockchain. Layer 2 solutions might fit very well under a definition of currency. Personally, I would include both layers under the umbrella of Bitcoin and say it is both.
It is a hard conversation to have though, as these labels are artifacts of an old technology. Transposing the definitions to a still emerging technology is not going to be done consistently for a while. We are going to be using the same words and mean different things. Getting anal about the use of words at this point isn't helpful, and just fuels contention.
Nobody wants just a settlement layer. They want a solid, robust, permissionless settlement layer to build (possibly many competing) payment networks (and other technologies) on top of. If broad enough adoption of a layer 2 standard happens and is built transparently into most Bitcoin clients, why would that not be Bitcoin?
Why be so abrasive and insistent that everybody use words the way you do? Why not just discuss what you want the capability of bitcoin to be, leaving the solution open to discussion?
A global p2p *currency* is still the goal for everyone participating in this discussion, the solution to scale to that ability just happens to be different.
The internet works because we have one global interoperable standard. Specific competing solutions are built on top of that. That's where competition is good-- necessary, in fact. The more distributed layer 1 is the lower the cost of entry to build a layer 2 and the more healthy competition you will see.
If you are afraid of Blockstream (for the sake of argument, I am not saying you specifically are) then their idea of Bitcoin actually makes competing with them easier. When a small startup or individual only need a decent server and a good internet connection to  run a full node and have direct access to the full validation of the network, we can't imagine the innovation that will be possible. If we limit it to a hand full of data centers and have to start paying for preferred access to the API, hoping they are honest, Bitcoin ceases to be distributed and, at best, becomes decentralized and the complete trustlessness and security of the network is replaced by trusting the hops between you and the blockchain.

It's a reasonable thing to ask for in an exchange and would have made something like the fraud at Gox much more difficult to go on as long as it did. It's not perfect when much of the assets are held in legacy currencies that can not enable such transparency, but it's certainly a step in the right direction. 
This is the time to drum up support so consumers start demanding this feature from exchanges. While I agree Peter Todd has been guilty of FUD on past occasions, he's is spot on here. The market isn't going to respond with more transparency if our behavior doesn't demand it.

The spam attack will become very costly before Bitcoin fees approach any other form of transfer. Once the spam attack drops out there is still plenty of room at the moment. Obviously, there won't be indefinitely. Fortunately SW is on it's way and blocksize increases after that.

Does the attack require that they still pay 40 satoshi/byte for the extra 1mb? Or could they accomplish it with less?
@_date: 2016-01-30 13:49:12
Still is. The argument is over how long until it is required. And how much more time is bought by SegWit.

@_date: 2017-02-27 15:59:34
Which is what segwit and LN will help do. Bitcoin fails as a currency now no matter how big the blocksize is, confirmations take an unknown time and waiting for that make it impossible to pay for your cart full of groceries and leave.
An argument can be made that people are mostly honest and 0-conf transaction could be accepted for things like coffee for little risk, but a currency needs to make larger riskier transactions faster than the security model of Bitcoin-as-is allows.
The currency like features that these 2nd layers allow are much more important to Bitcoin becoming a currency than the blocksize (though segwit increases that too)
Anyone who opposes segwit opposes bitcoin as a currency.

@_date: 2016-03-28 14:25:19
I just want to push back a little; I agree it is sad that our live are dictated by the things you mention. But such will only disappear when (if?) we achieve a post scarcity society. Unfortunate, so far, our goalpost of fulfilling needs moves as fast as out technology provides for them. But until we get to a point where resources completely fulfill every need and want, we have to make choices and prioritize our needs and wants.
Money is not negative to humans moving forward. Scarcity is. Money is a tool that enables us to quantify our resources and the cost of our decisions. Is it so sad that I ask how much it is going to cost if it gets me to to make a decision to save for food and rent rather than go out drinking? Whats the alternative without money? How do we decide what is frivolous and what is a need?
I don't think a post scarcity society is achievable with our current level of technology, or the technology of the foreseeable future. Money is the best we can do in the mean time.
I do think (hope?) a world can exist where money is just not needed-- obsolete. I think mankind should embrace that goal, but we have no idea how to do it yet.

My harsh words, however, are much less harsh than the reality of being responsible for the loss of other's money. Many many times in this space people who have been great at developing usable interfaces and apps decided to create something with custody of or access to spend funds that are irreversible and were hacked. My previous insults are quite mild compared to the words that were said to them afterward. 
To be clear, I am not speaking to you from an ivory tower telling you that you are not good enough for what I do. By the looks of it you seem to likely be a better PHP developer than I am.

Seriously? How about those that want to scale actually run test after test and generate tons of data to throw in the face of the opposition. When the Chief Scientist can't even generate overwhelming scientific data to support his strong position, something is wrong.


Why not try SW and see where we end up, then. Even the spam attack wasn't enough to do much damage, that was easily mitigated by a small fee. Lets see where we are after we get a little more head room from something we are doing anyway because of the other important benefits. Then we can make a decision from a better vantage point.


If layer 1 becomes more centralized layer 2 is just as centralized. The fewer nodes the easier it is to revoke permission to participate on the network. If a few dozen letters can be served that limit processing certain kind of transactions and forwarded to the few miners we are already left with, severe damage can be done to the network. A distributed network can route around such attempts.
Maybe the risk of decentralization isn't great enough, but lets see some data. And lots of it. The burden of proof is on those that want to make the change, not on those that are actively pursuing a solution that has broad consensus and, at the very least, helps the problem.

You wait for consensus. When pretty much everybody is on the same page it is a good indicator that there is little chance of there being an unmeasured segment with any significance. It's why HFs are dangerous if you don't have consensus. You have an unmeasured segment that can cause big problems.
And it is why UASF is not great either. If the industry got together and nearly all the exchanges and businesses where leading the charge of UASF it would be different. That impossible to measure segment would be be in consensus and what is left (miners) would be measurable. 
However, if thousands of nodes want to take the risk because segwit is worth it, there is not much that can be done. Come flag day, if segwit is not activated, it will be a bit messy but there will only be a fork if the anti segwit side can maintain a majority of hashing.

No amount of nodes can override the consensus rules on my node. As long as there are other nodes (including some miners) that have the same rules we will have our own network and will reject an invalid chain no matter how long it is. That is a characteristic of Nakamoto Concesus that give it value; a value I would not trade for any USD conversion of the network token.

I think your misunderstanding is just semantics.
A **valid** transaction just means it passes the rules-- it is formatted correctly and the balances are available to be spent.
A transaction is broadcast by the sender and nodes pass it around each checking if is valid. If it is not valid the node drops it. If it is valid it propagates through the network and ends up in the queue of miners.
When a miner solves a block and chooses to include one of these valid transactions, the transaction is now **confirmed** and is considered by the network to be spent. The block is then passed around the network by the node, each checking that it follows the rules and when a miner receives it they then switch to solving a block on top of the new one. As block upon block is built the confirmed transactions become more secure.

It didn't because building a chain with 2mb in invalid. No matter how long it is it will be rejected.
In the right circumstances the minority may change their rules and join the new chain, but as seen with ETH/ETC it is not a fundamental characteristic of a blockchain. The longest chain does not have absolute economic power and it has no power to overtake the chain with the consensus rules I choose to run on my node.

Segwit *is* onchain scaling. Schnorr signatures *is* onchain scaling. Before these huge optimizations happen we'll never get everyone to agree to a hardfork.
When they are exhausted and we see what happens in the real world with second layer solutions a compelling case to increase max_block_size can be made. If scaling is still needed, there are few better options and we're well ahead with progress of consumer tech there will be little to argue against it.

I got it in Jan of 2014 (so pretty late from my perspective) from one of the major back issue suppliers. A couple months later a fairly prominent Bitcoiner posted that they had just purchased a copy from a private collector after they had checked the same place I had as well as others with no luck. I really lucked out and must have purchased one of the last ones.
It cost me £58. I didn't tell my wife how much it cost, not because she would care, but because I was a bit embarrassed to pay so much for something so silly.

Softforks do not need replay protection-- segwit is consensus compatible with the "legacy" chain so there would not be a chain split.

And what ventures are those exactly? Would they have the same low risk level as collecting fees over and over with cryptographically secure funds with very little overhead? Are these ventures so abundant that an unlimited supply of BTC can be invested without the rates falling because of the abundance of investors trying to put their money in something better?
There are 21 trillion units to divide amongst the economy and all the niche uses. I have no doubt that the value of BTC will scale appropriately and the rates of return of each type of investment will align the the properties that investment offers. With programmable money, we should see that balance happen more efficiently than we ever have.

Correct, it was a bubble. But he described it as an "unfounded fad" in the same category as Tulip Mania. Tell the early investors in eBay and Amazon that those companies have no value beyond what people will pay for them. Many companies reached beyond what the internet (at the time) was good for; much like many ICOs and alts reach past what a blockchain is good for.
He probably doesn't have the technical knowledge to sort the good from the bad in the space, but rather than just acknowledge that he labels the whole thing a pyramid scheme with little to no value.

No, the expectation that a distributed, pseudonymous, borderless, permissionless, non-seizable payment network that uses megawatts of electricity to secure should be practically free with such a narrow user base to spread the operational cost over is ridiculous.
As it grows and tech improves (the version number is below 1 on purpose) the cost will go down. It will likely be possible in the nearer future due to payment channels, but the true utility of Bitcoin is not for middle-class white Americans to buy coffee. Compare the fees to western union. Compare the fees to the cost of being unbanked. Don't compare them to Paypal and Visa-- quite yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:51:26


For the sake of argument, I'll agree that this is likely eventually, but there is no reason to try and get it done in a couple months. It is a ridiculous timescale to roll out a hardfork. There are plenty of other options to upgrade capacity being worked on as well as safer ways being developed to achieve a hardfork cleanly.


First, *I* will break nothing by running my node that rejects there invalid blocks. I did not sign. NONE of the Core devs signed. Quite a few large Bitcoin companies did not sign.
Second, the deal has been broken already by those who did the HF blocksize increase before segwit was activated. Broken by a proxy of the largest party to the agreement.

Context is important. That excerpt has nothing to do with voting on new rules.
That section is about coming to consensus when the chain is under attack by a dishonest actor. The majority outpaces the attacker and the attacker's chain is discarded by the entire network because it is the shortest. New consensus rules are invalid and would not be accepted by the client no matter how much hashing power is behind them.

The fact remains that a large portion of the devs and user base are not satisfied and think it is reckless and dangerous. Politics and hand-waving aside, the devs that produce Core are the ones that are trusted by users and the industry... even many claiming to support other implementations this past year still ran Core. The Core devs overwhelmingly believe it to be a bad choice for technical reasons. 
Segwit wasn't a gift or a concession-- it was nearly unanimously believed to be an upgrade. ONE entity opposed segwit got their proxies to play games to stall it so they could continue to use their optimization (protected by patents) covertly.

There is no way to achieve the throughput needed for Visa levels on anything but a private or, at best, a network with a few federated nodes.

All we would have managed to do is supplant Visa with a new corporation that will eventually inherit all the qualities we hate as it bows to the will of the shareholders and governments it operates under.

They can't change the rules of what defines Bitcoin and then claim that they are Bitcoin rather than the continuation of the consensus rules. Certainly not just because a handful of miners decide to support the new rules.

As they have heavily criticized other developers, I think the burden of proof for their own proficiency lies on them.

Most of their own codebase was written by the devs that they most heavily criticize.
Many proposals have major issues pointed out to them by these Core Devs. Maybe the core devs are wrong... then the BU devs need to provide a working implementation that proves them wrong.

The Ƀ seemed a simple and elegant solution to me. It's supported ubiquitously and it is not used for anything else. There is even a lower case that could be adopted for a smaller denomination. I'm not sure what 'major effort' it would have taken to switch fro the 'real one'; It wasn't used in anything but graphics since it didn't exist and still won't be supported everywhere for some time.
At any rate, the decision between the two are entirely feeling and preference based and I am fine with that. I just wish the people who care enough to argue adamantly for the 'real one' would admit tat rather than just insult the appearance of the Ƀ.

Your emphasis is narrowing the context even further.


decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to
redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the
work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up
diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.
To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,
the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.
There is the rest of the section you snipped your quote out of. It is about how PoW secures the blockchain from an attack from a dishonest actor. It has absolutely nothing to do with voting on upgrades to the protocol.

It's both (focusing on the foundation) or neither. Of course, I use the term Bitcoin as an umbrella that encompasses all of the technology built with like layer 2 payment networks.

If you were mining on your PC in late 2013, you likely have no worthwhile balance to speak of. ASICs had already entered the scene and difficulty was too high. You would have nothing if you were solo mining and pennies if you were mining with a pool. If you were mining with a pool it is likely the balance is there rather than on your computer, unless maybe it was p2pool, but it's probably not worth the trouble. You're going to have to download and verify another 80GB of the blockchain before you can load your wallet. It doesn't sound like you have that space at the moment.

No one is taking about settlement only. In such a scenario there would be nothing to settle. 
Instant cheap layer 2 solutions are the completion of Bitcoin. They push toward a feature-full Bitcoin 1.0 that operates all levels (including a newly possible niche of micro-transaction) of the economy. By keeping the settlement layer relatively slow and dumb the trustless immutable characteristics of it can be passed on to the derivative networks that use it as a backbone.
I honestly don't understand how anyone can not be completely excited about the potential global changing power of such a topology. Some are happy to sacrifice that to a Paypal 2.0 just to hopefully get user adoption right now? A few corporate datacenters running the mining and all of the nodes?

Even with a dynamic blocksize there would still be a blocksize limit that, if the mempool is full, will limit you from including the fees from 2 blocks.
If the blocks are not full then there is no fee market except by miners artificially limiting transactions like this. Putting the decision of the artificial limit in the hands on the few that are directly profiting from it doesn't seem like it could have a feedback loop that hurts the network?  Maybe it could be done... But I only said it would be hard to implement. Please tell me the algorithm that will limit abuse and sustain itself in ab environment with greedy cartels as actors, if it is so simple. If you can not then your accusations of rhetoric are merely rhetoric themselves.

My comment was more along the lines of "this is why we can't have nice things".
This situation just shows that miners are willing to play political and economics games to benefit themselves. There is not a problem with that in itself; Bitcoin is designed on the idea of making that into a strength. But handing direct control over  economic factors to those profiting from it, when the balance of power is so concentrated in a few would make the mechanism that keeps the system in check hard to design.
Certainly, it would be in the miners best interest to sustain the system, but a large actor focused only on the short term or a miner who is just miscalculates the effect of their action could throw the balance off and create a feedback loop that harms the network. Or in the case of heavy contention like we've seen around the block size here; instead of playing political games of rhetoric, character assassination, and all the crap spewed on reddit and elsewhere while the blockchain kept on rolling, the fight would be played on the network, with ideologies, economical misunderstanding and inaccurate predictions of a few all being accepted as input that directly shapes the system.
The sample size of miners  is too small and the viewpoints to different to expect to have a mechanism that can handle the decision well.

I would say the intent here is to help (at least pretend to) with people that made  a mistake and now have a stuck transaction. Mistakes happen, clients calculate fees wrong; there needs to be a mechanism to fix those errors.

That's what addition development like Lightning is for. Once transaction malleability is fixed with Segwit, Lightning (several implementations) and probably some competing solutions will not be far behind.

In your quest to make it simple you over simplified and cut out important factors like layer 2 technologies that enable high volume low cost transactions without sacrificing the entry level to running a node.
No one wants bitcoin to be used for only high value transactions; they want high volumes of low value and low fee transactions to be combined into one high value transaction. It's not a compromise it is the best of both worlds.

Defending Bitcoin by whatever means are at your disposal is not a benevolent self-sacrifice. It is an act to protect your interests.

Any fork regardless of segwit is dangerous for users on both sides


EDA is sure working great for Bcash, so good they are doing an emergency hardfork to fix it. Miners will mine whatever people are buying. 


What issue issue? There is none. There is plenty of space at the moment and room to grow with optimizations and second layer tech for a while. As the time for needing a hardfork nears consensus for it will grow. A little tiny increase right now will just remove the pressure to optimize and make things work better and will split into 2 chains for no functional gain.


No shit. But this little increase won't be enough. Further, If VISA level payments are going through the network on the consensus level there will be only a few companies able to process blocks. (and will likely end up merging into one) Those companies will be subject to listening to the government in any territory they operate. They will have the means to censor and the directive to do so. Bitcoin will be a failure. It will be a Paypal that takes a powerplant to operate.

Mods doing censorship here != the opposition. To suggest that the concerns of some of the greatest minds in the field are baseless and irrational and that substantial argument does not exist or has not been communicated is ridiculous. You may not agree with their arguments, but quite a few of the brightest minds in the space do.
Many on the XT side, including some devs, have pandered to populist politics and arguments based on emotion.
Many on the Core side, including some devs, have pandered to populist politics and arguments based on emotion.
If you are letting the actions of a few decide the legitimacy of the position, (I'm not saying that is for sure what you have done, but it's the only substance in your post other than you position) you are being just as irrational as those who you are complaining about being irrational.

The transaction is likely to be in the mempool on BTC1 mining nodes and may get confirmed on both chains. And even failing a carry-over in the mempool, the transaction may be replayed. The person you are sending BTC to would likely end up with both coins. 
That would have been the result if the transaction had made it through before the fork, though.

That sort of sentiment also sounds religious. A system that survives an attack while the users remain idle in their apathy may not be possible. It is the best system that has been invented and no other system can weather it better that we know of (this attack is actually a feature of many other cryptocurrencies).
If people have to mine for a short period to preserve a system that they believe has the potential preserves their freedom-- good for them. It's not for free, they are getting something out of it.

Permissible != let it happen without comment
Bad ideas can get implemented with significant ignorant influential people. Public discourse even uncivil discourse is an important part of a free market.
No one is proposing a structure that makes such thing illegal or impossible (would such a mechanism even be possible?) They are participating in free speech and the free market by openly criticizing ideas that they see as flawed. There are a finite number of users to participate in the natural selection of ideas. Most need weeded out before we test them.

They do make more miners than they have the ability to use themselves because they have a limited supply of electricity available. It's not as simple as you suggest. Selling miners gives them an extra profit stream and ramps up their production to lower the cost of their own equipment.
Their mining profitability would suffer from the increasing difficulty, but I think their (rather high) pricing reflects that.

This is true, but it is a choice between this attack and mining 2X as an attack.

Common sense. I have no strong technically sound reason or scientific data. Hell, I don't really have any strong data that suggests a correlation, but you can't have that for everything in life. I read a bunch of articles about the fork that cast doubt on the future of Bitcoin and then the price dropped.
Do you think my claim is preposterous that the timing of the price drop and all the "bitcoin is in a civil war" articles are not connected? Or are you just being a reactionary dick? Chill out.
When the F2Pool says things like the following it certainly suggests there is bad sentiment from the miners toward the XT drama. But that's just me making assumptions with an incomplete dataset again.

@_date: 2017-11-13 00:11:29
Bitcoin is resistant to such attacks, but it (and nothing that we know of) is perfectly guarded. Part of the defense is honest actors exposing the dishonest. Idly sitting back and watching an attack is a ridiculous notion. We're not talking about censoring them at the protocol level and cutting off their financing. Past that level Bitcoin has no inherent morality.

Transactions are a series of inputs and output. Outputs are a balance and an address (hashed public key). When I make a transaction I take outputs (now inputs in my transaction) and define how much of the total balance of those outputs goes to which new addresses (these are the new outputs)and sign it with my private key. Any leftover balance not going to the new outputs from the total of the new inputs goes to the miner as a fee.
If one of those new outputs was one you have the private key for, you know have the ability to sign a transaction with your private key and specify what new output(s) the balance belongs to.

I'm not making a claim, I was making a summary of our conversation. It went like this--
Me: Mods doing censorship here != the opposition.
You: The hell it doesn't.
My comment seems apt to me.


The bulk of the real debate happens elsewhere. There is a lot of discussion that happens here and BCT, but it's really just filtered bits from the dev mailinglist. Even so, I think the censorship is ridiculous.


No, that is not rational. I'll go ahead and accept the premise that the only reason to censor is because you can't win otherwise. (that is just an assumption that ignores other possibilities) It's the same small group of people censoring here and at bitcointalk, so the rational conclusion is that this small group of people (a very small minority of the people against the fork) doesn't believe they can win otherwise. 


You keep trying to change the subject, this whole conversation I have just been trying to get you to remove your blanket stereotype of those against the fork. Somehow you pretend to be afraid to discuss the pros of XT yet you feel safe arguing for it using logical fallacies, attacking it's supporters, and being unwilling to admit that they have any valid reason for their disagreement with you.
My rational conclusions:
* You are too emotionally involved in this to carry on a rational discussion. Perhaps, that is a reaction to being hurt by the censorship of you thoughts. If this later is true, I empathize, but further conversation will likely not result in finding any middle ground. We should end this conversation, no good will come of it.
* You are trolling. We should end this conversation, no good will come of it.

You are also assuming that the action was taken (by a few) because it was needed. Many good ideas are supported by lunatics that do horrible things. That is not a reflection on the idea and not a reflection on the rest of those that hold the idea.

I have a decent computer and live in a country (mostly) covered with broadband. Correct, I would have no problem with 8MB block and I could go larger. Bcash proponents don't stop there, though. The claim that Visa level transactions on the consensus layer is the goal. That scale is unreachable by anyone without a data center and a way to profit off of running that data center (like a subscription for permission to participate in the network). You just end up with a federated permissioned network with PoW that takes megawatts of energy just to secure a blockchain when none is even needed at that point.

Not everyone needs to, but it should be reasonable to do so if you need to verify transaction. BCH proponents argue that VISA level transactions on-chain is the goal, and if that means it takes a supercomputer to process trasactions (it will) then so be it.
That barrier is only going to be possible for a few entities and it will have to be enteties profiting a good deal off of it to justify the cost to operate. Big data off of spying off transactions? Subsciption to participate? It's hard to say what that income stream would look like.
What it certainly does is put those few companies in the sights of regulators and censors. They will beable to crush Bitcoin's freedom like they did the dreams of Paypal when it started.

This does not change the fact the existing infrastructure in the US was not created in a free market and the current players were given advantages and any emerging competition is currently hindered by regulation.
The current players have a government granted advantage. The next step toward a free market is not granting their privileged position power no one else can yield.

No one is against larger blocks. Many (most of the developers) are against a hardfork at this time that sets the policy for years ahead of what we can anticipate the market will look like or what optimizations will bring. 
We need a lot of things before we get to 10-15 million users. Blocksize is an easy one and can be scaled up rather easily if it is *needed*. 


Oh, I see where you are coming from now. If the axiom of the blocksize debate is you're own wealth, do you see why I might not trust that you opinion is in the best interest of the entire network?

It averages the cost. You get equal good luck and bad luck and it cancels itself out of the equation.
Beating the market is a zero sum game which means you have to be in the smartest 50% of volume to win. In the long run, people are just really bad at beating the market.

@_date: 2017-04-01 19:07:48
Rainbow is heading there too
edit: and I thin we'll have better defense in the long run being nested with the bitcoin symbols.
@_date: 2017-04-02 17:13:24
We can't stand up to nationalism on that scale in this environment. Working together would have had the same results. 
Edit: Now working against each other certainly is very undesirable. This is the newest segwit script. Is severly in the way of plans?
@_date: 2017-04-15 21:52:28
And the irony is we are waiting on segwit to be able to build those fraud proof.
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:17:53
Excellent. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-04-02 03:10:08
Me an one other person have been making good progress. A few more would really help

Who specifically has rejected it? I am aware of no one that makes rational decisions that has.

It's a fallacy if I think his lacking supports my side, or even negates his. It warns against accepting his council, though. He thinks he should be listened to and that his opinion caries weight. One of his main arguments is that Core Devs doesn't care about Bitcoin as much as he does. Setting his flawed character on a pedestal is the only way to way to argue against his irrational arguments.
Rational people (without an ulterior motive) already dismiss his position because the rational argument has already been made.
@_date: 2017-04-17 13:41:15
It used to be here in spades. It got a bit better when the other sub split off. There was some overzealous moderation here but it was targeted at the low quality conspiracy ridden post that made this place unreadable at the beginning of this drama. There were some I was sad to see go, but for the most part it just took the riffraff and made this place better.
It's still here to a point mixed in with quality content, but at at least it is not drowning out the quality content. And reasonable replies are not downvoted out of existence.
@_date: 2017-04-08 02:31:18
Running a pool != owning hashing power. Ver just has a pool that allows his buddy to unload some of his hashing power and make things look more decentralized than they are.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:53:49
It does get quite old when something is continuously trending up.
And there is much more interesting drama at the moment.
@_date: 2017-04-12 12:13:15
If BU supporters try to reconcile their cognitive dissonance, their heads might explode. It will be a slow road to recovery after attaching so much of their identity to following liars.
@_date: 2016-02-28 21:48:24
The amount of computing power required to verify the PoW would be substantially more than to create a bad request. It would probably open additional DOS attack vectors rather than solve any.
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:39:26
What really sucks is there were a bunch of people focused on trying to "claim" the 2px strip outside of our border instead of on the words.
@_date: 2017-04-24 12:40:18
I have a feeling someone wanted to stop paying for the many virtual servers they were paying for to fake support. Roger's comment last week about nodes not being unneeded as something that just slows down the network was planned to give something to point to other than abandonment.
edit. Oh, that's even steeper than the steep decline over the past week. Yeah, BU devs done fucked up again.
@_date: 2017-04-01 22:55:49
It just won't fit. It's way to large in too crowded of an area.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:19:43
UASF was going to jam that spoon into that babies mouth and it no amount of wiggling or clenching of the jaw was going to help. The hand with the candy was not from the same person. Maybe the second hand knew the 2X would fail, and they are responsible for any trickery. The first hand was honest all along.
And to be clear, only a couple of Core devs were wielding the spoon (it was mostly users). Most devs were trying to convince the babies to pick up the spoon and feed itself.
@_date: 2017-04-02 07:24:37
Aside from the transparency around "wit" the script will allow that.
It ignores the pixels in the upper left and the few between the banner and icon and whatever goes they will stay
@_date: 2017-04-01 16:50:41
The outline is just starting. Feel free to help bring it to life.
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:38:25
No one s asking you to trow it away. The idea of a functional well adopted currency for small transactions will reduce the distributed nature of Bitcoin. Something I think most would agree, on it's own (there are likely trade-offs that many would be willing to make), would be a negative thing for Bitcoin.
Dealing with the capacity increase on the Blockchain reduces the distribution for the entire network. Dealing with it on a layer 2 protocol such as LN only reduces (it does not remove) the distribution on that layer.
The question is do you want large data centers to be the only ones capable of payment processing for the entire network or just the layer 2 solutions? 
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:40:14
Well me and at least one other are working at the bottom if you want to join us. If people seem to like yours and jump on I guess I give up and help you.

Now that things seem pretty much uncer control on the main logo. If somehow you've missed my spam, we're working on a segwit logo just below.
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:40:41
No, that's not the face you make when doing that.
@_date: 2017-04-14 16:51:18
It's not like he deleted anything unique. Listen to any other interview of Ver and you can hear him say the same three things over and over again. If you skip to the end of his interview to hear is talking points you'll save some time because he is repeats things faster as they go along. Though, he also tends to be speaking at a much higher pitch by then and that can a bit annoying.
However, I'm all for airing his antics as much as possible. His frail emotional state is quite apparent and just highlights his lack of any substantial argument.
Hopefully at some point he'll watch one of his own interviews and realize that maybe he needs to see someone to talk through his issues and whatever baggage in his life is causing this break down. The guy did a lot for Bitcoin at the beginning; I do hope he gets some help and gets better.
@_date: 2017-04-24 18:52:56
Their philosophy prefers you not run a node. Unless you are solo mining, of course.
@_date: 2017-04-02 21:52:21
That looks like a lot of fighting
This can be done in stages without haveing as many pixels to focus on. IE we do the logo first which will stand on its own aesthetically without a background.
When that established we move to the "Bitcoin"
And then we can fill in the background
edit: 
@_date: 2017-04-20 14:25:47
Of course it is a political statement but "smash the state" might be an overstatement.
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:13:04
Probably because of the awesome logo at @_date: 2017-04-10 13:54:25


And without a doubt would be the result of his plans. There is a HUGE chuck of users that will never accept EC and will never adopt consensus rules that validate an EC block.

If we had 2mb blocks today this attack would still be trivial and still only a minor inconvenience that can be thwarted by a small fee.
@_date: 2017-04-27 13:43:24
If they had not created such tools we wouldn't know if we should trust them or not. Now that they have positioned themselves as a dominant force on the network and not used their devastating power maliciously, we know that we can trust them. They should be commended for their benevolence. I think it time to switch the protocol to proof-of-Jihan. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 17:46:46
Craig Wright might have a few pointers of what not to do. Though, if you're not committing fraud his advice might not be useful for you.

**If you are participating manually do not follow OP**
I screwed up with the script and left a row out of the "bitcoin" text. It's still totally legible and looks fine, which is why no one noticed until it was too late. Now that bots are running with the scripts below, changing them would just cause an autonomous war with those who have left for the night. So, if you are doing it manually follow [this](
~~I'll work on the script. Someone figure out the coordinate of the top left pixel for me.~~
**Stage 1**
**Stage 2**
Once the center logo is established, run this to maintain that and start the white and "bitcoin"
**Stage 3**
[preview]( Left finish this off
@_date: 2017-04-01 21:00:03
Even if I accept your reasoning as objective, segwit does have a logo; so it's to late to argue about it.
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:43:24


@_date: 2017-04-02 03:50:25
A couple of us have been working for hours. A few more people would get it done.
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:35:22
Unfortunately there were number of people obsessed with expansion and trying to claim the 2px strip on the right. So, we got lopsided orange and messed up words.
@_date: 2017-04-05 14:08:08
It's a shame Gavin worked so hard to push this guy away.
@_date: 2016-02-05 20:56:23
Then perhaps you are not using the data for it's intended function. Being imprecise has no ill effect on the network and no technology exists to synchronize time without a centralized operation. A few options exist, but do you split the network if they disagree on data that is not critical?
You could make an argument that it should just be discarded, but I think a change would require an argument that retaining the timestamp was a burden. Otherwise, you are just being difficult and arguing for the sake of being right.
@_date: 2016-02-25 22:38:57
Then why did they fight so hard to stay on the list of wallets on bitcoin.org a couple months ago?
This is perhaps a step forward in customer relations, but it would have been nice if they apologized for not realizing or not communicating effectively the distinction. Acknowlement and a small apology for their part in the frustration and confusion of it's users would have gone a long way.
I expect that to be consistent they will soon ask to be delisted from the wallet page on bitcoin.org.
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:06:05
It's a good question to figure out after we have exhausted other means that are on the table to increase throughput. It's not a black and white answer and any inrease would have an inverse effect on user security. How far to you push the boundary (which is hardly defined) while you still have a bunch of great options, some of which are ready to go?
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:42:32
Yes, it is.
@_date: 2017-04-02 21:34:34
Thoughts? I have a script ready to go. It fits pretty well in our area. I've dropped segwit. Maybe I'll try a smaller one to the left if this goes well. But I think we can rally and get this done.
It ignores the background for now to get the main part done, but we can add orange later if we get this established.
edit: actually go [here]( to keep comments in one place
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:23:34
Core devs can't promise. The few that could make it to the meeting could promise to write the code, but there is no way to promise adoption of a HF.
It won't be uncontested. There will be a chain split if something like that occurs and some core devs tried to speak for all core devs.
@_date: 2017-04-02 02:41:50
Let's really show them and finish segwit despite their effort.
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:07:58
So anyone with with an antminer could run asicboost if there was a pool that supported it? Any pools hosted somewhere that doesn't care about these patents? I'd like see how long they keep calling an optimization if asicboost is running on a competing pool with the hardware they sold... and signalling for segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:56:34
Anyone with old scripts running. Please shut them off. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:37:35


Yes, that is correct. But the safety that the economic majority support earns is miners following suit. The economic majority is a hard metric to measure, though. IF we go into it with what we persevere as the economic majority and a minority of hash power, we would have an unclean HF and merely hope that we were right about the EM supporting our chain and hope that the resolve of the EM is strong enough to stay supportive of our chain.
If there is a majority of hash supports BIP148: game over, no HF, segwit wins. If not, there will be a HF and a bit of uncertainly.
A world where bitcoin continues to be stalled or that Jihans continues to gain more control are not great options either and may actually be riskier than even the chance of a HF from neither side relenting.
@_date: 2017-04-05 13:16:00
Correct. I forgot about that, I wasn't actively working on it quite yet. I don't have the source frames with me. I might be able to add the 5 or 10 second of that later.
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:00:46
A few compatible public pools and an easy to follow tutorial could make this interesting if a lot of people jumped on board. IANAL either, but the US patent holders (Lerner?) probably have a case against Bitmain with the tech being present on the chip; certainly, they have a case if Bitmain US customers are using the tech.
@_date: 2017-04-26 12:00:35
I get it and feel the same; certainly the same about Coinbase. Decent amounts of anonymous money flowing through the organization would probably cause them far more problems than the few donations they lose because of it.
The organisation doesn't have all the same ideals as me, but they do have many in common that result in a product that could be sighted as a milestone in humanity. So I'm not going to hold back my other assets over the issue.
@_date: 2016-02-21 00:18:20
Maybe it's not completely black and white especially now that we are talking about something much more conservative than BIP101, but I would go nowhere near as far as saying that the opposite is true. There are many simple ways to deal with the issue in your post mentioned in the discussion.
@_date: 2017-04-03 00:02:39
This is only drawing the logo in the center at the moment
@_date: 2017-04-21 17:10:14
That has potential. Though, ubiquitous internet coverage and payment channels will probably provide better options than trying to physically trade something. Those will probably be available before widespread ownership of a stand alone verifying device.
Not trying to be a naysayer; I'm sure there is a niche market for something like this even at the current stage of development and I strongly encourage trying to solve the problems trading with a  decentralized currency. You certainly are continually progressing. Don't stop doing what you're doing.
@_date: 2017-04-20 13:04:15

You kick off the people riding the bus for almost free just so they can say it is full to get more support for their new bigger bus by charging a slightly higher and still very reasonable ticket price.
Meanwhile Core devs are retrofitting the bus with more efficient seating (segwit) to fit more people and others are developing Uber (LN).

There is an inverse relationship between the between a big blocker talking and other's perception of their intelligence. You would be best served to sit in silence with a contemplative look on your face. But be careful, there is a fine line between looking like you're working through something and looking confused.

One thing I liked about using the Ƀ for bitcoin was the lower case ƀ for another denomination. Though, I think the biggest factor was that I can already type it on the internet and expect it to be seen by nearly everyone. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:00:03
Maybe we can ask to replace the small bitcoin logo. We pretty much the same people. No need for two varied, oddly placed logos.

Emergent Consensus -- the proposed scaling 'solution' of BU. The only way it is going to happen is with a contentious miner activated hardfork. In the face of that USAF is certainly a safe option.
Not only did he not know UASF would happen, I'm not sure he even understands now that it is a much more powerful tool and has way more leverage than his threatened HF and his panic political maneuvering is just driving more users to support a UASF, He is not going to win this.
@_date: 2019-04-17 02:40:21
 was kind enough to post this here so we could share in the lulz. Dude is not asking for your support and I don't think he cares if you believe this is true or not. Besides, what could he possibly do that would prove it any further?

@_date: 2017-04-10 14:03:59
First we would need to define disastrous. There could be Mt Gox scale effects on the market, but there is little that could cause a technical failure. Bitcoin will go on (even if as 2 chains) no matter what it trades for and would likely recover in the long term. Especially now that long sought after bug fix now enables some pretty great technological advancements. Certainly negative, but not a disaster in my book.
@_date: 2017-04-02 07:08:30
Not a bad effort overnight. Someone at the other sub was kind enough to take a screenshot for us

If no change was made that was against his will, what does that imply other than the fact that they take the consensus model seriously.
If you are trying to find out his level of direct control he has, the question would be: "Was there a change you wanted, that was not adopted, in the past year or so?"

Because it is outside the scope of their business plan? They are still operating in a space quite a few have failed in. I assume they have a clue about what they are doing.
They are happy to sell chips, but nobody really seems to think that it is that lucrative of a business to do the R&amp;D for consumer hardware.
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:20:39
They've been updated.


Meh. Most of the work was done by someone else. I only modified it slightly and converted the new design to the array. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 11:47:55
It gives us 2MB blocks almost right away. The other things already mentioned are next, which gives us more throughput (which is the real issue) and then a block size increase likely with HF is on the roadmap. But no, there are people  saying no segwit, that's the problem. It's the first step that enables quite a lot more scaling.
Here is a good video with an understanding of how networks scale.

This needs to be near the bitcoin logo to the and there is little space left for us to fit. Maybe you can move down and to the right a bit? We might have more pixels to move at this point. If you do, I'm sure we'd be happy to help/defend you after we're done.

I haven't looked at the transactions filling up the mempool at the moment. Are they all actual economic activity or are they again thousands of transactions spending the same coins over and over?

I've (barely) started the segwit logo to the left, if any one is interested in helping.
@_date: 2019-04-25 01:40:06
That is about as far from how a Ponzi Scheme operates as you can get. A Ponzi Scheme relies on people's greed to keep their money in a (fake) investment with (fake) high returns. Real negative returns on funds trapped in a system is an unethical scheme, just not a Ponzi Scheme.
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:14:47
Not to mention, there is significant doubt that those signaling are really running BU as they claim.
@_date: 2017-04-18 14:53:31
They are offering to pay for your loss of profit. Subtracting the expect electricity cost that you are not paying from the expected revenue seems reasonable. Though if your electricty cost are lower than thte figure they use, you're getting screwed.
There is also the matter of compensating for the depreciation incurred while mining with it in the interim and sending you a used miner, but I'll doubt they admit to doing that.
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:06:50
So the default state of everything, including ideas not yet conceived, is rejected?
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:27:53
We can solve it again at that threshold. Why is that a problem? I trust game theory in the design of Bitcoin to guide incremental changes far more than I do an 'expert' projection of technology limitations or economical predictions.
I have not yet seen an elegant solution that does not greatly shift power to a particular part of the network or have a growth model based on something better then crystal ball predictions. If an elegant solution is proposed it will quickly gain consensus, much like SW was quickly accepted.
edit: removed some extra some words.
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:18:36
If a small fee, solves the problem and leaves the entry to running a full node low enough for the average extra computer, I am for that solution. You're slippery-slope argument does not sway me. We can deal with capacity increases if they actually become a problem rather than the current sky-is-falling agenda driven narrative.

Commit access to a public repository is hardly the center of power in an open source environment. That position is closer to menial labor than a position of power. All power here is political.

Unless the minority is isolated, it will not continue building off it's chain that is being rejected. If the minority worked together in isolation and could over take the majority at some point, yes it would be a problem. But if they are connected to the network they will reorg themselves nearly every time the majority mines a couple of blocks. The rule of thumb about waiting for 6 confirmations would be very important at that time and maybe a few more blocks would be a good idea. But if you are doing that there is little danger unless the hashing power is closely split.

How? There are idealists that will maintain the minority chain. Just like with ETH/ETC.
All you have is conjecture. There has never been an example play out like you say.
I'm not a fan of UASF, but there is nothing that can stop it if the masses decide to stand up to the handfull of miners in the way of progress.

Especially when one side just hammers the same point and emotional sound bites over and over, louder and louder.

Exactly. A UASF does not have the power to completely subvert the miners. If UASF were pushed with a majority of the miners against it then it would just become a UAHF with the miners continuing with their non-segwit-signalling blocks and and a longer chain that the UASF side could touch with their new consensus rules.
A UASF is more like a futures market to get the market to virtually react and figure out where it is ahead of time and smooth the volatility of a somewhat contentious change. A successful UASF needs the non-UASF holders dump their shares. If they still have value on flag day it could get ugly if people see a way to leverage things to make some money.

You forget that your full hard drive is full of compressed jpegs and mp4s optimized to use as little space as possible.
Segwit double the blocksize and can go up to 4mb. Segwit also enables [schnorr signatures]( which will increase capacity even further. It also enable payment channels, which increases capacity and enable microtransactions and instant transactions secured by the blockchain.
A HF to 10MB is more akin to your growing collection of lolcat bitmaps taking up your harddrive space and trying to solve it by stacking platter after platter onto a hard drive with no optimization of data density, no optimization to data transfer, and no optimized compression of data.

Only if a minority tries to SF is there any risk. If a majority of hashing power gets behind the users the majority keeps mining a chain that is accepted by the minority and they themselves (unless they take action to do otherwise) will orphan their own blocks. In a contentious hard fork the mionority chain will split off and the new majority chain would be invalid and not accepted; there is a guaranteed fork.
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:51:32
The plan for BIP148 is to abort without a majority of hash power. So I am assuming BIP148 would have the majority. If it does not and they went through with it, then it would cause a HF.
The minority "chain" (non-segwit blocks) would never make it past a few blocks before a reorg to rejoin the majority.

There is no minority chain in UASF. If it is a longer chain, it is the majority. If it is shorter it orphans itself because the longer chain (in this case UASF) does not violate consensus rules. ALL hashing power in the UASF is dedicated to orphaning the blocks not signaling for segwit.

It would be a disaster. Forget whether or not is is a good idea on the tech side and realize it is not a good idea on the social side. A SF is less problematic, but they still wanted 95% support before activating. On the flip side UASF wouldn't be a thing if **just a few people** would signal segwit.
A HF right now would have hundreds/thousands of people against it. It's not something Core devs can just decide to do.
Convince a few people to signal segwit or convince hundreds of people to change their consensus  rules. Which is easier?

If you don't have a single safe place to store a seed make an M of N wallet that can be distributed to those you trust, but now you don't have to trust a single person not to steal from you, you only have to trust that a number of them will not collude to steal from you.

Not only did they say the cost outweighed the benefits they provided the benefits in a better way and stuck the blocksize increase in their back pocket for a for a future deployment that will cost less and have more benefit if it is needed.
And maybe he meant the poo-pooing of the HF concerns and issues of a minor blocksize increase brought up by nearly all of the top engineers in the space. That has indeed been a big problem amongst CEOs and startups that don't want to hire quality engineers because their VC runway is running short.

There is a lot to keep an eye on in this community and it's easy to miss things and really hard to catch up if you are new. 
This is a very old conversation, however, and it has been discussed over and over. Currently, the greatest consensus seems to be behind using the name "bits" for 100 satoshis. 
See [BIP176]( for details and rationale.
But simply it means:
1,000,000 bits = 1 Bitcoin
1,000 = 1 mBTC
Not included in the proposal is the "ƀ" symbol, which I think would work really well. It's a Unicode 1.0 symbol, so it is pretty universally supported, and its use around the word it very limited. It is also the lower case for the "Ƀ" which has a good bit of use for Bitcoin around the community.

The BDPL uses the patent system against itself. It is a threat of mutually assured destruction. Claiming we should not use patents is the same as saying citizens should give up their guns to stop gun violence.

They have a CEO that has been hostile to the dev community. He thought he was firing a select few devs, but the reality is that the overwhelming majority of talent agree with and develop alongside those few.
He interjected himself into the scaling debate when he can't even scale his webserver infrastructure. He showed more excitement for crypto kitties than he ever has for segwit or lightning.
Anybody with enough talent has far better opportunities in this space than to work for that asshat. 
At this point, the only thing I hope for them is a quick failure so a better company can fill the vacuum. Fuck short-term gains from mass converts (that just end up turning into weak hands), I want the bad actors gone.

Yes, probably most, but you're exaggerating quite a bit; I still see a lot of the same people that have weathered "crash" after "crash" since the first (public) Mt Gox hack in 2011 sent the price to $2.


Yeah, that is how it works. That's how price rises in stock of Apple, Google, Exxon Mobile all happen.
Every crash shakes off a bit of the chaff. Those who understand and believe in the tech remain and some of the get-richers finally look at it from a new perspective and their motives change.
There has been a lot more to cope with over the last two years of division in the community that was arguing over scaling than the price. If OP is coping with anything it is the losses of reputations, the character attacks and slowed development of the tech. One side chose to push one direction and OP is excited that it is working- it was worth it.
Your judgements based on the short-term perspective of price do not interest me.

Absolutely not. If they are in a wallet you have the keys for you will have an identical balance on both chains that you can spend immediately (though it's probably best to wait for the dust to settle) on both chains. On an exchange, you will have to wait for them to decide which chain to support. If they choose both it will probably take a while to implement both. If it is only one you will be out the balance on the other chain.


If you have the full bitcoin core client, v0.15 will provide the cleanest and safest split by not talking to the client that has planned to implement the incompatible rules.
If you use a light client, you will need to check with the provider to see what chain they will support and what dangers may be present in the aftermath of the fork.
 &gt;Will we end up with both versions of the coin automatically or do we just get one and have to claim the other somehow?
If you have the private keys, you will have an identical balance on the identical address on each chain. If you create a transaction without replay protection and broadcast it on one network, the same transaction will be valid on the other network and troublemakers will likely copy it and the same balance will be transferred to the same addresses on the other chain. 2x has refused to implement replay protection by default so care will need to be given after the fork. 


As long as you have the private keys for the address a balance is in at the moment of the fork then you will be able to spend the balance on both chains. Though, you will need a compatible client for each of the networks.


"Upgrade" is the wrong word. There is a change to the consensus rules, but the 2x client is actually struggling to keep up with the many tech improvements and upgrades being released by Core. They will indeed need a new name Segwit2X sucks for a name and because the change in 2x (or at least the way the change is being executed) is very strongly opposed and the Bitcoin chain *will* continue as "Bitcoin".


It's possible. Though, when it comes down to it, these forks are just new altcoins that start with the transaction history of bitcoin. Just a specific way to do the "airdrop" coins that have been relaesd from time to time. It's just a gimmick that will get old eventually and new launches will see diminished returns which will dimish the frequency of new lunches.


I have no interest in long term speculation on 2x. The creation was subject to the decision by a corporate oligarchy behind closed doors and further decisions will also be subject to the same. Really worrisome is that such an oligarchy is subject to pressures from the government to implement features that weaken the power of cryptocurrency.
I will dump my 2x coins shortly after the fork.

Whatever address your bitcoin balances are in at the moment of the split will have an identical balance on the 2xcoin chain in the same address. After the split, you can spend your bitcoin on the Bitcoin Blockchain and your 2xcoin on the new alt chain. 
It gets tricky after the spilt because the 2x developers refuse to add replay protection. At first (while the balances are in the same address on both chains) when you create and broadcast a transaction someone could copy that transaction and broadcast it onto the other chain. So you need to spend them on one chain to yourself first. There will likely be some tutorials to help people, but those who aren't aware will likely lose money on one of the chains thanks to the 2x developers.

It works like this. If I create a transaction to send Bitcoin from one address to another and sign it, because the outputs and keys are identical, the same transaction is valid on the other chain.  If you sent me Bitcoin or 2xcoin I could rebroadcast the transaction and receive the same balance of the other. Also troublemakers (even though they aren't profiting from it)  can (and probably will) watch for those transactions and copy them to the other chain.
There are ways that 2X could make it so you could easily make transactions that would only be valid on one chain, but the 2x developer refuses to do so. 
Still, there are slightly more difficult ways and there will probably be tools to split your coins and once the balances are in different outputs on each chain they can no longer be replayed. However, since 2X keeps changing their plans (even though it is only a bit over a month away) it is unlikely anyone will release a tool until after the fork. If you just sit tight your funds are safe. They are only put at risk if you spend them to an address you don't own.
Also, an alternative (which may not be crazy if 2x happens to fall flat on its face and not be worth much) would be to not care about the balance on the other chain. If you only want the BTC and don't care what happens to the 2X coins you can freely spend BTC as you please, it won't be put at risk, but whoever you send BTC to could also end up with your 2x coins.

The beautiful thing about a second layer is that it can be diverse and full of competition. Sidechains that do specific business targeted tasks are one possibility. Sidechains that are open and have a different set of security/convenience than Bitcoin like MimbleWimble are another. Then there are payment channels, like the several interoperating competing implementations of Lightning. And many other technologies probably to come. Open to anyone with the desire and skill.
And they can all coexist.
Scaling with a simple blocksize increase gets us paypal 2.0 with a handful of companies running $20k nodes. A far different topography where the free market will constantly be struggling under the thumb of a cartel and government intervention.

No, that is in reference to a computer just able to verify transactions in blocks. Once you get to large enough blocks an average computer wouldn't be able to verify blocks fast enough to keep up blocks that are coming in every 10 minutes (on average)
That's the consequence of the vision of big blockers and their visa level on-chain transactions. And once you make the base layer inaccessible to the average user the layers built on top will rely on the permission of the shrinking supply of those that can bear the cost of entry.
Core vision is a base layer distributed amongst average computer users. (forget raspberry pi's no one has that as a serious long-term goal) Permission to build on top of that is easy when thousands of average users are running the base layer and it is much harder to shut down.

A few cents cheaper (only at the moment)  and a few minutes faster (though sometimes an hour or more) is not why Bitcoin is better than PayPal.
That might be something to point out once payment channels are broadly deployed and adopted, but for now PayPal is probably the quicker cheaper payment network. Unless you can't use PayPal because you are denied banking because of your social standing, fear confiscation of your funds, or wish to participate in commerce that does not meet PayPal's moral code;  that is where Bitcoin outshines PayPal.

I *really* hope for the former. There are people on that side that I've admired and respected in the past. The current course 2x is on is contrary to everything I thought they valued in Bitcoin and would mean my judge of character was wrong.
While I disagree with them, I see where they are coming from and understand they are frustrated, but if they could humbly wait a little while for a consensus to develop rather than try to (and unsuccessfully) force me to go along with them, I would respect them more.

You're bitcoins are not in your paper wallet. They are on the blockchain in the outputs of the transaction that last spent them. Your paper wallet holds the key to unlock and spend them from where they are.

It won't really help, the overwhelming majority of nodes will already reject the fork. You sybiling and making multiple diluted connections to other core nodes adds nothing to security.
If it's just about political posturing, adding a few more "votes" to the super majority will do far less good than the damage you've done by giving the other side the idea that the node counts are just a sybil attack and are not real.

The 2x is also not large enough for long-term usage. But there is plenty of road left to roll out a few more things into a hard fork. It's what is being asked for by the technical community. That will make it an easier decision and will give people plenty of reason to support it.
Again, the issue is not the change, it is the method. A hard fork is dangerous and will split the coin if there is not overwhelming agreement. That's the reality. Be as shocked as you wish, but it is in your court to convince people otherwise. Repeating the same arguments over and over doesn't seem to do it. No one is even arguing against the need for bigger blocks eventually. 
The continued failed predictions of an imminent demise without quick action doesn't help your cause either. 
This "compromise" to keep the community together is the only wedge splitting it apart at the moment. Which now seem to be the planned result to pump the new ICO from the 2X leaders.

Maybe I am just hopelessly cynical (paranoid?), but I assume that the narrative of Kleiman being Satoshi and CSW swooped in and stole his Bitcoin is just a new angle to CSW's con.

There is no concrete percentage because there is no concrete action by any miners at this point, only political posturing. They can wave their hands with "NYA" all they want, but until their operation switches the yet-to-be-final, hastily developed client they haven't really gotten on board.
Currently, the BT2 token on bitfnex (which represent coins on the 2x chain after the fork) is trading at less than 1/5 of a bitcoin. If that is an accurate prediction of the market value then switching would cause an 80% reduction in income. I don't see many miners going through with it, they aren't mining for charity.

I think you've got a grasp of it. The most funds the miner could possibly end up with is the transaction fee, which would likely be higher than most fees because the hacker would want to have really good chance of being chosen and included in the next block. It would still likely only be a few dollars. If it we higher in the hundreds of dollars worth or more I would bet the majority of pools and large scale operations would be kind enough to return them after the fact.
Any transaction validation would likely be done in ignorance though because the hacker is going to move much quicker than the incompetent admins who are loosing the hypothetical millions.

Forget arguing about incentives, there has never been a case where a hacker has compromised a system for millions and knowledge spread fast enough (10 min) to stop the transaction. Perhaps the buttcoiner is arguing that the new residing address should be blacklisted so the funds can not move further. However, that only works if the blacklist is universal. If it is not universal the transaction will get through eventually. You could blacklist found blocks that include the transaction and create chaos and forks on the blockchain, but the network will likely not be able to create a majority supporting the blacklist faster then the hacker can move the funds.
This is actually good news^TM though, because it also mean blacklists can't stop funds from moving to and from whatever social minority is the target of the political agenda of the government.

Not that the trend is certain to continue, but so far the value of bitcoin has increased at a higher rate than the block reward has decreased.
Also there is nothing stopping miners from participating in the economy of LN and collecting fees off of it. There are also probably many efficiencies to be gained that would give them an economic advantage over non-miners.
Of course they would hope to stay safely the status quo, as all dominant business do, but innovation and technological advances are going to require them to adapt and find their niche in the economy as it changes.
It is ignorant to believe the economy is as simple as you describe and that it is certain doom. You don't know what the value of Bitcoin will be in the future. You don't know what the fees will be on LN or on-chain. You just have wild guesses.
If Bitcoin has a value to society those fees will balance out according to that value. The security that the value affords will be provided by miners; and as long as it all stays decentralized it will have a chance to find an equilibrium.

The only thing that stops counterfeit printed currency is the difficulty in reproducing it accurately. If you give everyone a printer to make it you destroy the security measures needed for paper currency and it can not be trustworthy.
If you cover the private key with a sticker there is no way to know if the balance is actually redeemable; you have destroyed the security measures of Bitcoin and it is not trustworthy. (or you could just have a copy of the key and redeem it after you give it to me)

Don't expect the Ƀ to go away. The fact that I expect the vast majority to see the symbol speaks to the wide inclusion of the character in fonts due to being part of unicode since version 1.
I still see boxes for several of the latest additions. Results will very with other operating systems and fonts, of course. But that is the problem.
It's a rational argument. There are rational arguments for other symbols and even less-rational ones that are important and valid argument, such as traditional usage. However, don't expect others to yield their preference because you have an inclination to see acts of rectal penetration in inanimate symbols.
I am happy that a Bitcoin symbol is being added to the currency symbol block, whether it is my preference or not.  I do lean a bit toward the the Ƀ, but in the end I doubt any debate of the matter will have a lasting effect on adoption.

The specialized hardware for mining (ASICs) are millions of times more powerful than a a high end PC at mining. PCs probably can't even participate in pools today. Even if they could there is little to learn that is applicable to mining with an ASIC. And if you want to spend a couple grand on a ASIC, you will probably not make that back.

I don't think you are following what is being said. Self regulation is me making conscious choices based on my morals and conducting myself in a manner that treat other idividuals in a way that aligns with my beliefs. ie. I think destruction of property is wrong. Therefore, I do not smash in car windows. Also, If someone asks to borrow my crow bar to go smash a car window, I decline. I have no obligation to support the beliefs and morals of others who may believe smashing car widows is okay.


Defined by the person making a decision about their personal resources.


You can stop that with either:
a)More Regulation- I think we both already agree this is a bad option
b) Competition- Use an exchange that aligns with your values. (self regulation that provides market pressure) Or start a new exchange with like minded individuals.
No, I'm not for it. Though it's only possible with government regulations that bars new competition from entering the market. If that is the situation I don't want to solve it by adding additional government regulations.
Of course, there is not an oligopoly at the moment so it's not really a valid argument to begin with. 
If I look at the blockchain and see payment to you from an address of a known [insert hyperbolic social stigma here], I have a right to refuse business from you.

The fear of offchain transactions leading to centralization is gone because of payment channels and lightning. There will be "banks" of sorts, but there will many in competition and the barrier to entry for new "banks" will be quite low. Further, the counterparty risk in dealing with offchain transactions with government controlled entities like Coinbase will not be precent because of the design of these second layer scaling solution. While not as fully decentralized as the protocol layer, payment channels will still be very decentralized and the full decentralization of the protocol layer can be used for other use cases.


Quite possible. However many of the vocal supporters are okay with centralization any becoming "paypal 2.0". The main obstacle in getting miners on board has stated that Bitcoin is destined to become a monopoly and it would seem that it is his ambition to run it.

Honestly, I just don't care. Even if he were untrustworthy , he's not going to slip something in unnoticed, so who care if he gets it back. It doesn't seem likely he is going to use the access in the near future, so who cares if he doesn't.
The decision either way is just political theater.

Assuming you and JB are in the US... You do not owe. JB may owe. It depends on the value of the 10BTC when JB acquired it. If it he got it for $4K and you took it as payment for $10k, then he would owe taxes for $6k. If he held the BTC for more than 1 year he would only owe capital gains on the $6K; if not it would be the full income tax rate because it was a short term investment.
Though if this is more than a hypothetical question you might wish to talk to a licensed tax professional.

Already there is huge disagreement about what the signers thought they were agreeing to. Some believing it means Segwit ASAP then immediately starting working toward a HF. Some think it is redeploying segwit with the HF code in place and set to activate. The later is complicated for a number of reasons and will take months to test and deploy. And some (Roger/bitcoin.com) somehow got the idea that HF would come first.
Even if they get on the same page, (It seems even that might not be seen before Aug 1) I have no faith that those stalling segwit aren't just waiting for some technicality of the agreement to use as an excuse to drop support for the it and delay further.

Keep in mind, while I believe Bitcoin will succeed in the long run, there is a very good chance that deployments in early adopting businesses will fail. It's really not something I would go out on a limb to get someone to use in their business... especially if they don't have the technical knowledge to grasp it fully. If something goes wrong and money or time is lost it will deeply sour their view of the technology.
Definitely educate him, but don't push him to invest resources in it until his technical understanding goes way up or the learning curve goes down because of software advancements.
Unless, he just has a webshop and would be adding it as a payment option. In that case he doesn't need to understand Bitcoin or how it works. He just need to know that is someone chooses to pay him for the $5 item with Bipay(or other processor), $5 will end up in his checking account.

I don't believe this is true. Everything in the Core roadmap will create a p2p cash system.
Nothing Satoshi ever said implies scaling had to be done in in a layer 1 protocol. In fact many things elude to more centralized solutions layer 2 solutions. Lighting and similar is actually much more p2p than what Satoshi may have envisioned at the time and even leaves room for layer 2 solutions to compete rather than an all or nothing solution to scaling.
Satoshi was a man, and his ideas even evolved for the time he was around. The ideas since he left may have changed slightly, but it's had to imagine his would not have chanved at all if he stayed. The vision is the same.

Even though they can't even take it from my cold dead hands (assuming proper opsec) I won't take it that far. I probably would choose their backdoored cryptocurrency if that were my only other option to prison.

We need a better network for those transaction spikes, not just bigger blocks. We could be on the path to bigger blocks if segwit were activated. 
Simply throwing blocksize at it would be like scaling a computer by adding more and more Pentuim 3 CPUs to the mother board. We need better CPUs with technology advances in a number of areas as we start to add more transistors, Hell we could even offload some of work to other processing layers, like GPUs.
Segwit is block increase and almost no one is against further block increases in the future, but you know this and are just being willfully obtuse.

He doesn't have commit access which means he can not finalize changes that he or others have proposed. He still has the same access to propose changes, the same as most devs.
He has barely used the commit access for quite a while because he wanted to do other things. He has been asked to give up the access previously because it's good security practice not to give elevated privileges if they are not used. But he never agreed to it and no one forced the issue.
They removed it when Gavin's blog post about him believing Craig Wright was Satoshi was published. Craig Wright being a previously debunked Satoshi made it seem like Gavin may have been hacked so it was a good idea to remove the commit access until they knew for sure. (Satoshi's idle account that still had commit access was hacked and used to change the codebase on Sourceforge once)
Circumstances forced their hand and now that things are where they should be according to the simple security principal of [least privilege]( there is no reason to change it back-- especially if Gavin hasn't even asked, as OP is trying to clarify.

Roger decides he wants to play a new game with the ball. He huffs and puffs reminding everyone that he has been playing with the ball since recess began and that he should decide.
Everyone else on the playground decide on some new rules that include the things Roger wanted to do, but he wants it his way and runs around in the middle interfering and keeping the others from playing their game.
Some teachers step in and tell everyone to play both games; first the one everyone else want to play and then the one Roger wants. Everyone starts playing and realize that Roger's rules are not needed, at least not yet. Besides there is not enough time before recess ends to implement his rules in a way that includes everyone.

That would suggest to me that it isn't an issue in the Gentoo community. The 3 or 4 people in the intersection of Gentoo users, bitcoin users, and users who blindly install binaries seem to like it the way it is.
If you are in that demographic and have a problem bring up the issue in the Gentoo community. If you are not, stop with the drama to shame others into complying with what you believe the set of rules should be on the Bitcoin Network.
If you really care, you can vote by setting up your own full node with your set of rules of what you believe is appropriate use of the network.

Indeed. However Capitalism is not a pure and perfect ideal. It's the best humanity has come up with, for sure, but it does fall short at times and an idea needs to stand on it's own merits rather than justifying it by simply being the capitalist answer. It is also not anti-capitalist to say that one ought not compete but work together. If I however said their should be a law specifying they work together rather than compete, that would be anti-capitalist.
As much as "is it capitalist?" does not stand on it's own as a litmus test, neither  do the generalized aspects of capitalism. Would "competition is good for users" true of hardware standards? Would each manufacturer producing screws of different incompatible standards be good? No. The ideal for users is they all use the same standards and compete in other areas of the manufacturing process.
