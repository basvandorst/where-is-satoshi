Wait what?
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:15:38


Yes they are. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:50:29
yep. made some nice gains over the past few months thanks to bitcoin. now looking to diversify into cryptos with true potential.
I still have a large portion of my holdings in BTC. Hopefully one day the scaling issue is resolved
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:43:09
This only applies to people who want to cash out tho
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:06:02
I feel like Bitcoin was just an experiment. There are much better cryptos out there in terms of tech, believe it or not.
But who knows? I think having a hedge position in bitcoin is always a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:50:03
Hopefully you're holding it on an exchange
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:50
Go for it, though I wouldn't recommend mining Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:51:30
What are you talking about lol. It took me like a few hours of googling to find 100 other exhanges that are better than coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:48:55
That doesn't really explain why posts get removed at the mention of an alt. What if I want to talk about alts in relation to Bitcoin? I can do that on any other sub except here
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:50:09
He has it backwards
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:24:18
I think we'll hit 10k if not 11k sometime in the next month or two, before crashing to the current ath
this is simply by looking at the current pattern, and it's all speculative of course

I moved my btc out of electrum, but the btg is still there. You can check your balance here: 
I don't think you can send/receive btg yet though

Buying and hodling.
I'd rather the market crash and I lose all my money than sell at a loss and regret it later.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:41:59
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:29:59
If there's anything I've learned in the past 2 weeks of Bitcoin investing is to never sell at a loss. I've gone through far too many posts of people regretting not hodling onto their btc.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:44:48
Calm down, you can still exchange currencies as soon as you buy them, you just can't take them out until the payments fully clear.
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:00:23
Opinion discarded
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:56:47
I wonder how he would react knowing the value of Bitcoin today
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:34:56
I wish I knew Bitcoin existed back in the day, I would've definitely invested. Unfortunately I've only been in the game for about 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:41:59
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:39:32
Meh, I only have a couple hundred invested right now, not worth it
I'm hoping it tanks so I can buy more
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:58:29

@_date: 2017-10-31 18:57:33
Honestly I agree. Don't see the point in these threads
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:37:20
Yeesh...good luck with that
@_date: 2017-09-25 01:01:47
Stop reminding me of what could have been
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:14:17
Buy low, buy high, sell never
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:43:37
Exaggeration. Transaction fees won't kill bitcoin, but they will make adoption extremely difficult
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:25:04
Welp, time to go buy a costume
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:04:43
This is why I don't put in more than I'm willing to lose. I'm more willing to lose it all than to sell at a loss.

He basically won the btc lottery and acts like he knows what he's talking about. Dude's ego is through the roof.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:29:46
I use Gemini right now. I'm sure GDAX is better but I can't verify my account for some reason.
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:37:20
Yeesh...good luck with that
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:38:11
No losses are guaranteed until you sell
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:12:50
Can't wait for mine in a few years lol
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:17:54
There's a subway at my uni that accepts btc. I would've bought if I wasn't a hodler

But the reason I invest is so that I don't have to work
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:40:43
You're basically gambling when you try to time the market. Just hold and DCA. I've made back 1/3 of my investment only in the past month by simply buying and waiting.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:30:10
I mean, I made more than 1/3 of my initial investment back in just the past month, simply by buying random amounts at random intervals. Just going off that, I think it's possible
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:23:24
No one knows what you "should" do when it comes to Bitcoin. Do what you think you should do.

Which exchange are you using? Gemini lets you invest as soon as you initiate the bank transfer. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:44:29
I left it til the last minute too, except I was using Gemini which has no withdrawal limits or fees, and my coins arrived in minutes
