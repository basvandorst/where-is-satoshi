They're paying for the internet like everyone else, what they do with the internet they paid for is up to them. Welcome to internet.


​They're paying for their mailbox like everyone else. What they do with their email is up to the. Welcome to email.


​They're paying for the parking space like everyone else. What they do with their space is up to them. Welcome to car parks.


​They're paying for the phone calls like everyone else. What they do with their phone line is up to them. Welcome to telephones.


*They're paying miner fees like everyone else. What they do with the block space that they've paid for is up to them, not you. Welcome to Bitcoin.*  
No, welcome to logic. Having the ability to spam/abuse a system does not stop it being spam or abuse just because you spent money doing it.
I wish Veriblock and equivalents would use BCH and fill the blocks to 64mb, then we will see if "spam" exists when BCH has a congestion problem in the same way and can't actually raise the blocksize any higher, "scaling".

I understand what you're saying, but there is one dimension of this system that you're not accepting - that is the general purpose of the system itself.
If we say Bitcoin is just a distributed ledger with no intended purpose, use as desired, then what you're saying completely applies. But Bitcoin was designed as "P2P digital cash", it WAS designed with a purpose.
"Email was designed for communication, not to advertise, using it as an advertising tool is abuse/spam.
Car parks near shops are designed to service the shops, not to store cars indefinitely, blocking shoppers is abuse/"spam". "
I gave multiple examples highlighting this concept, the purpose of a system can be abused/spammed regardless of whether you pay money to use it. It depends what you're using it for.
If Bitcoin was full to the extent that each transaction on-chain was 1M USD fees and used \*\*only\*\* for underwriting insurance (and no second layers), nothing to do with payments so nothing sent, only a fee to underwrite - is that abuse of the p2p electronic cash Bitcoin system? They paid the fee.

I don't think people understand yet that the fees are meant to be high according to its current design, Bitcoin is "permissionless, decentralized, unconfiscatable". It's Lightning which is the P2P cash aspect of it.
In the next 12 months large players will push out all the "normal'" guys from Bitcoin, who will go to Bcash or will adopt Lightning (hopefully).
But 1,000,000 "normal" guys are worth 1 big player. The Amercan big players (behind the up coming rally) won't be going to Bcash on the basis that has too much Chinese support and is less secure.
Everyone can make their choice, there is no "right answer" in this. Only what is suitable for you at the current time.
In the meantime Bcash bcash blocksteam core blah blah /s

You're confused. The question is whether you can't abuse a system if you paid to use it. Not whether or not you can build more car-parks. After the number of examples I gave, you'd think everyone would be able to follow what the point was.

Go to an OTC desk, I have to think you're trolling to ask here. In fact, I know you are.
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:56:08
The other poster that was arguing with me now gets what I was saying. The issue isn't with me, you are just too thick to understand a very simple premise.
Bitcoin is P2P Electronic Cash System you can't then fill the system with high fee transactions, that don't transfer any value, without destroying the entire premise of the system.
I'll assume you still don't understand.
Bitcoin's PURPOSE is outlined in the whitepaper, P2P electronic cash system. If, for example, you fill the blocks with transactions that have the sole purpose of writing insurance claims to the blockchain, no cash transferred, to the point where the fees were 1M USD a transaction, you no longer have Bitcoin. It's no longer used as an electronic cash system (assuming no second layers), the "transactions" that destroyed the systems original purpose are SPAM. They're an abuse of the purpose of the system. 
Like using emails to market, or using a shopping mall's car parks to store your vehicles and prevent shoppers having easy access to the shop that provided the parking in the first place (Oh look a car park owner that doesn't just want the parking fee).
Get it yet, obnoxious arrogant dim wit?

It doesn't matter, you will lose all you made and more if you continue. Your gambling win has given you a misplaced confidence. Trades are made with no more than 3% of your balance, this affords you a losing streak without wiping out your account. 
The best traders in the world are right 60-70% of the time, that means statistically you will get a few trades wrong in a row - based on how you trade you would wipe your account after the first set of bad trades. If you understand what I'm saying, you should thank me, not call me a dork as I'm telling you the cold truth.
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:01:34
The fact you fail to realize the point of those examples is just mind blowing for me. They're about abusing the intent of a system.
If the car park analogy was not good enough for you surely the others could have assisted in helping you get the point of what I was saying.
Let's take it down a notch, if Veri block equivalents filled the BCH blocksize to 64MB, then outbid each other to create 10USD fees - such that you could nor anyone else could no longer make payments inexpensively - is that abuse of the system? A cheap payments network has been taken down for an unrelated use case.
One could say "Veriblock killed BCH's main use case", but who cares, because they paid to do it. Starting to catch on?

No they don't have to do shit. As you said this is real life, people make their decisions and mistakes and face consequences whether positive or negative.
If giving an employee access to the cold wallet is required to rectify this mistake, should they do it and put everyone at risk? If the boss of the company needs to leave his new born and unwell child to access the cold wallet in another country should he do it? It's his choice, that's the point. 
Fact is 5k might be a lot to you, but it's not worth any discomfort for many...the dog sitter, plane ticket and hotel to get to the correct jurisdiction could be worth more than this 5k - no way. Tough luck.

Sorry but you're an idiot and this comment has clearly been brigaded to have any up-votes.
"I'm not ddos'ing their website, I pay to use use the internet to open lots of someone's webpage, if I'm blocking other users that's because their server is too small."
"This isn't a spam email, I'm sending lots of emails because I have a use for it as part of my business and I'm using Email as intended, if that fills their mailbox quickly disrupting their normal use its because their mailbox is too small."
"I'm not abusing the car parking system, I store my cars here permanently instead of using a garage and pay the fee like anyone else would. If it's full its not my fault, it's just too small a car park."
"I cold call as part of my legitimate marketing, I pay to do it like anyone else would pay to use the phone, if I'm blocking your phone line and preventing other calls reaching you it's your fault for not having redirects."
"I'm not spamming the blockchain, I'm paying like anyone else and it's part of my new veriblock business, if I'm preventing others using Bitcoin as easily its because the blocksize is too small."

That's literally the point, many examples in real life where people get annoyed over abuse of a system. 
You're making my argument for me, but writing it in a style that implies you disagree with what I'm saying.

Wrong wrong wrong.  Liquidation means the position was closed by the exchange due to their entire account being empty and they can no longer go in the red.
If they had a Stop Loss the position would be "closed" not "liquidated".

Valid phone calls are not spam, they were paid for with fees. Phone calls are permissionless......"there are no spam phone calls".

Do you want to know why? Because we all made enough money that we don't NEED the remainder.
Take Roger Ver, if Bitcoin goes to 0 he is still crazy wealthy. It's the same for all long term hodlers.
We are smug as fuck.

It's not opinion, it's fact. Liquidation means the position was closed by the exchange due to their entire account being empty and they can no longer go in the red.

I think there are MASSIVELY more Bitcoin multi millionaires than you could ever imagine.
There are literally hundreds of thousands of people who ran businesses accepting Bitcoin as a payment method since it's inception.
A single order ran 100+ BTC for a long time. People make many orders a day. It wasn't easy to cash out large amounts for a looong time, which meant that people were playing with free money, outside of the profits of the business itself.
Anyway, Congratulations :-)
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:08:40
My position is not wrong, there is no rebuttal. If you destroy a system's original purpose you have abused the system, it could not be more simple.
EVERY single present use case for Bitcoin would be destroyed if it became an insurance underwriting system with 1M USD fees. But no, according to you that's fine because they pay the fees. Jesus fucking christ where did people like you come from in this community. Talking about mental illness, you're something else.
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:29:24
BCH had potential, it was right on the edge of complete shitcoin - but now, seriously, it's completely finished for them. Censoring transactions is the end of the line to any claim to "Bitcoin".

Selling and seeing the price go down isn't the hard bit, it's getting back in before it goes back up. Buying back in at a higher price cancels out your "profits" or causes you to miss the entire bullrun waiting for a dip that doesn't come.
That's the point of the OP, which you've clearly missed.
