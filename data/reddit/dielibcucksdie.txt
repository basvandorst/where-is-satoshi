Even worse than that, it's an "I heard some talking heads say a thing in the MSM and pretend that means I'm an economist". 
Those types of subs (r/historians is another good example) are echo chambers for MSM revisionism. Anything that isn't specifically pre-approved by MSM "authority" figures simply doesn't exist to those types.

Ding ding ding. Any NSA created digital currency would have them owning master private keys that would allow them to sweep any wallet or create any amount of coins from thin air.

That's what they claim. The reality, as has been proven by numerous letters blocking funds for wire transfers from BoA accounts, is something else.
You realize that corporations are capable of lying, right? There's not some universal law in effect that prevents them from doing so. There's also a huge history of them lying for personal gain.

Eh, not really. People just haven't figured out what to use them for that's actually good. 
Ultimately I think they will be instrumental to trustless P2P multi-server virtual worlds, where each server doesn't have to trust the owners of other servers in order to link to them, and allow players to go from one to the next with their characters intact.

If you put money in a bank, "legally" they own that money. It's not a safe storage method.
Most times they won't steal it but if there's a bank run they have no obligation to give you anything but "bank stock IOUs" that are worthless if the bank is going through a run.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:07:08
It's not their fucking money, is why.

It's the r/all threads that are the worst. Every retarded Keynesian "economics" "expert" rushes in to tell us all how we should be in love with usury and fraud via the Federal Reserve, and how unlimited money printing is the best economic policy, "bcus reasons".
The sub should probably just start locking threads as soon as they hit r/all, because every time one does, it's pure retardation, people just regurgitating whatever the propagandist MSM told them to think.

This exactly. This article was about moving to a "cashless society" to more closely monitor and control what you're allowed to buy, via a fiat one world currency which would be controlled and printed by, you guessed it, the Federal Reserve (Rothschild Usury Bank).
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:01:13
It's not only that, it's also that the MSM are propagandists at their core, and they have a vested interest in the fraudulent and usurious Federal Reserve sticking around and ripping people off for decades to come.
They are hardly objective. 
They've declared Bitcoin dead 236 times, let's just listen to them *this* time, surely they're right *now* /s
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:43:56
TIL Bitcoin hasn't been a store of value for 9 years already. Oh wait.
If you tards from r/all can't actually form a coherent thought about Bitcoin that you're not just regurgitating from the MSM, how about shutting up, no one cares.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:03:14
Because when you put money in a bank, you no longer own that money. It is, for all legal purposes, the bank's money. They are obligated to give you nothing but IOUs/bank "stock".
So of course they feel entitled to tell people what to do with the bank's money.

There are basically dozens of reasons why the comparison is stupid and useless, and no reasons why it makes a good comparison.
Of course the MSM started running with it, so every person impressed by MSM now repeats it as if it's wisdom straight from the Bitcoin Gods.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:07:45
"Coincidences" that all just happen to line up to make the person who "accidentally" had them happen tons of money are almost NEVER coincidence.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:55:04
Plus, they don't produce anything of value, ever. Engineers are constantly building things that have value, Bitcoin included.
Number of projects by Wall Street people that are comparable? Zero.
Turns out being a leech who simply skims off the top of others' transactions is pretty useless.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:44:30
Tell us more, oh grand master of all things Bitcoin. Please don't forget to work in the "tulip fever" myth into your long winded, nonsensical explanation.
TIL people who don't even understand the most basic concepts of computers, the internet or cryptography, but heard the MSM say "Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme" once and decided to uncritically regurgitate it at every opportunity are "skeptics".

Tons of bcash shills and brainwashed useful idiots who love the MSM and listened raptly every time (201 times!) they declared Bitcoin dead, or whatever other fake nonsense they claim at the time. Doesn't matter the topic really, and the more false and retarded the better for the sycophants.
People like that only care about virtue signaling to their little clique that they all heard the message from the talking heads on high in the MSM and are dutifully bleating it back out like so much diarrhea everywhere they can.

@_date: 2017-12-22 17:14:04
LMAO why do people think the dot com bubble is comparable at all?
You do realize the dot com bubble ONLY HAPPENED because of fraudulent IPOs, right?
Goldman Sachs lobbied to change IPO rules so they could start IPOs at companies that were *already tanking*, take insider-priced shares and sell them off right when the IPO hit, after which the company folded and investors in the IPO lost everything.
They did this with dozens of companies, the same way each time. 
The dot com bubble had nothing to do with any real market forces and everything to do with fraud.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:16:42
Cue long winded reply about how purposely packaging garbage loans as AAA is not fraud when banks and their ratings company subsidiaries do it because reasons. $3 trillion+ in fraud when done in that fashion is A-OKAY, they'll tell you, because committing mass fraud isn't illegal if you're a bank.
Toss in some retarded mumbling about how of COURSE it was just an accidental, honest imcpetent mistake that made them $3 trillion via orchestrated, coordinated fraud.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:24:22

Is it any wonder they resent people who actually create tangible, valuable products? They haven't actually created a single dollar of value in their lives.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:53:51
That would require Wall Street to actually invent anything at all, first. Turns out people that make nothing of value resent when people who have real jobs make something awesome.
Maybe they should go get a real job producing something of value.
