Rumors has it that the CIA is monitoring r/bitcoins more closely these days. I hope they haven't hired doom and gloom trolls too.
Edit; BTW, you will find most of the good news about bitcoins on the controversial subsection. This is because I noticed most good news get downvoted to hell before it even gets up to 20 votes. This forces the post to move to another section by default, so it gets hidden from the frontpage.

Uncle Sam doesn't really like BTC, so the IRS might decide to go a little further than big capital gains. IMO, its safer to report BTC gains above $300 to stay out of legal trouble.

Other upcoming crypto alternatives would neutralise bitcoins' monopoly. Bitcoin may end up just serving as the reserve currency backer for other more sophisticated and applicable coins.
Or bitcoins may serve as the common international peer to peer currency conversion.
I think that's why the massive bitcoins infrastructure is being roles out worldwide. While other coins are just traded.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:40:53
Is bitcoins likely to be a future reserve cryptocoin that gives backing to other coins?
Also, do you see a cooperation between bitcoins and banks in the near future?

You are the one who is trying to change the original subject of discussion. Because i gave that as an example doesnt mean i am wrong in my original assessment.  Thieves, hackers and murderers do exist everywhere not only in the bitcoin community. 
So for you to make your earlier statements that "it is only wierd, jealous and greedy bitcoiners who are obsessing about Satoshi meeting a violent end", is illogical. The bitcoin community have good reason to sympathise with him because his privacy has been voilated and that exposes him to risk.
@_date: 2014-03-14 12:54:41
Don't be scared that you are being downvoted to hell. Reddit is changing these days.The good inspiring news about bitcoins are being furiously thumbed down these days on reddit by mysterious redditers. 
That's why you see only doom and gloom news on bitcoin frontPage, while the good news such as yours, will end up at the controversial subsection if it can survive the downvotes.
Go to the bitcoin controversial section, you did be surprised the bitcoins news post that end up there. Some have even been automatically removed completely.

From day 1, I knew Mt Gox wasnt going to succeed. Everything about them just didn't appeal to me. When I started using bitcoin, i had several options, but blockchain was my chosen platform.

Auroracoins is circulated both in Iceland as well as in the international community. It is also traded by foreigners in exchanges. Since it is one of the popular coins, It's possible to do buisness with it outside of Iceland. For example; If an Icelandic clothing importer needs to buy and import clothing for sale in Iceland, he may do the trade in auroracoins if the foreign manufacturer accepts the coins.

As usual,  the IRS randomly selects people for tax audits. If a randomly selected person happens to be in the category you mentioned above? Then Yes, the IRS can go to the extent of issuing a subpoena to Overstock or exchanges to release information.  
They can even go further than that if you don't have backups.  
What if the IRS decides to randomly target Bitcoiners for audit. I don't mean to scare you, but that could be possible.

I like some occasional bad news on bitcoins. Its needed at times cos the price will fall. Yeah let bitcoin price drop, more more buying!
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:16:50
It may be a deliberate effort by some redditers who lost their money to Mt Gox to negatively circlejerk on bitcoins so the price will drop. Then they can buy more coins.
Or it may be what my fears are; That some very powerful people are hiring trolls to bring down bitcoins cos they don't want to see it succeed.

Bitcoin looks like a Ponzi scheme for now because of these issues; 1) It has a mysterious owner. 2) Its anonymous, no registration with personal identification. 3) you can get defrauded of your coins with no recoverable trace of it. 4) If there is a technical failure along the line in the system, there is no clear path on how to repair it.
Okay thats it from me.
Edit: But apart from these issues I earlier, its still in its infancy stage, and has a great prospects ahead. If bitcoin aims to be a currency and not just another stock investment, then I hope these issues get addressed soonest. For now, its more like a stock investment just like other stocks. By the way, wall street stock trading is seen by many people as a ponzi scheme.

India regulators would not clamp down on bitcoin if the whole concept of bitcoin is explained to them. When i mean d whole concept, i mean everything entirely. This includes how to operate d system incase a technical flaw occurs; revelation of d true owner of d system; how to trace hackers if that occurs; and how to trace a thief/money lauderer cos there will be thieves; and finally how to remove anonimity if its eventually needed along d way.

@_date: 2013-12-09 21:23:57
Bitcoin would be sustainable if 1 they eliminate all the technical flaws of the system,
2 get rid of anonimity, that is require account holders to be identified, this reduces fraud.
3 build a legal network into the system, that is, create accountability. By the way, this is needed because we are dealing with people's savings and hard earned money.
I see a great future for the bitcoin world though.

What people don't understand is that bitcoin is never a top to down movement and can never be. Bitcoin growth is naturally a bottom to up movement just like a grassroot movement. 
But that said, governments can decide to make it miserable if they want to. So I think the best thing to do, is to try to negotiate with companies and make them see the profit in it, then corporations do pay governments, boom they will convince the governments. It will be great to gain some support from the powers that be on top.

If the feds wanted to kill bitcoins, it will be a piece of cake for them. They can simply arrest the number two guy of bitcoin. Put him under intense scrutinity or torture to get some information. Then, if they are not satisfied with the information, begin picking up all the owners of exchanges in US or simply shut down coinbase, just like they did with silkroad.
Its pretty easy for them to do. All I am saying is, I think the feds have given bitcoins a pass and want to see it progress.

Tracing thieves: if tracing thieves snd recovering stolen coins is an impossible thing in bitcoin, then i guess that is why some people are skeptical about it, and some countries have branded it as a commodity, not a currency. 
If bitcoin is to succeed as a currency, these flaws would hav to be addressed.

 A lot of people keep asking me this questions; 1)If their bitcoin gets stolen, can they recover it or be reimbursed in the shortest possible time? And if there is a technical system failure somehow, how will it be tackled. 
Most of these people are the average salary working man who are reluctant to put their hard earned money into the system. How can we get the confidence of this middle working class folks on board the bitcoin train. Remember 90% of them are non-risk takers and I think they are the key to bitcoin becoming a success or failure. Pls ask them these questions thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:27:38
If it will not be much trouble, just open up a little bit about the major shareholders of the bitcoin buisness, (927 people own half of bitcoins), so people get to know a little about them. This will ease fears about bitcoin being a ponzi scheme.

The most threat to bitcoin i forsee is when a larger entity such as BRICS, mega-banks, China, Google, maybe EU creates their own altcoins.

I read the entire article, and i think it is a very good policy by the bitcoin foundation. At least, this will make faucets to increase the amount of satoshis they dispense, and weeds out those that give very insignificant amounts.
 If you read the end of the article very carefully, it says that some faucets came together to jointly form coinbox.me where your coins can be stored locally until it gets to the required amount. So, from what i get, these faucets were not even entirely weeded out, rather they found a way around the policy.

I don't think decentralization is a bug because no doubt, this is the greatest invention of our time. What I am saying is that unregulated decentralization is a disaster waiting to happen. There must be a way to make the bitcoin system accountable to its account holders and they have to create a way for stolen money to be recovered and given back to its owner. This will increase a lot of people's confidence in the system and make it more popular. 
A lot of working middle class people are asking these same questions I addressed here. Getting the confidence of middle class into bitcoin is the key to finally making it global, and if their concerns are not addressed, then.......I don't know.

1) So you can make an international wired transfer without paying high fees at western union.
2) So I send money to the person standing next to me in a second without the long process of writing checks, or going to the bank.
3) Had to delete my third point because someone told me to hush hush it. They dont want more organisations opposing and fighting bitcoins. They already had enough from banks and governments.

People who are affected by the disaster will be asked to place their QR code along with some form of confirmatory pictures/video to show they were actually affected. I think this eliminates scams.
Edit:I am saying, there may be no need to send donations to any organisation. With bitcoins, donations can now be sent directly to the victims through bitcoin peer to peer transaction.

My only worry about bitcoin is if a technical fault develops in d system along d way,  how is it going to be corrected/repaired. Also, there should be a way for people who have their coins were stolen to get justice. That is, there should be a way to trace thieves and recover stolen coins.

The Chinese don't like taking risk, so they want to be last to get in. That way they avoid any pitfalls associated with bitcoin.
