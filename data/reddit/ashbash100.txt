Cloud mining is a scam. If you could really profit from it, then the companies would raise prices or stop offering it, because they could make more money by using their rigs themselves instead of renting them out to us.

Oh, because my friend is looking to buy BTC with PayPal, and he hasn't found one that doesn't require you to show them your passport and tons of other confirmations.

Whoops must have spelled it wrong. It's something like that. I'm not lieing

I think that if bitcoin becomes the currency of the world, the price will rise up to about half a million. Otherwise, there wouldn't be enough coin to support the world economy.

What site do you use to buy BTC with paypal? But I agree with you. More BTC ATMS!
