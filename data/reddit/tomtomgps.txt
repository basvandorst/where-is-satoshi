Yeah I agree.  They don't have to be marketplaces. But they do have to give back to the community in one form or another.  When you look at the internet the reason it became so successful is in my opinion because people invested a lot of time building the infrastructure that was needed. 
I think this is what bitcoin and its community  is missing. Just look at how many exchanges exist and how many apps are actually trying to give something to the bitcoin community.   Everybody's trying to make a quick buck which is ok but only  a very few people are  investing hard work in creating services that benefit bitcoin and its users.

Sure you can argue that bitcoin has taken off if you look at the rate of development and the increase in value but when it comes down to it who actually uses bitcoins to buy stuff or sell stuff ? When I walk down the streets I never see any stores that accept bitcoin and yet I live in a fairly large city.  A lot of people look at bitcoin and think of the many opportunities but in the real world I don't see any signs  of  massive adoption, just people saying how much potential it has. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places but from what I see, no one uses bitcoin irl. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 02:43:47
Thats very understandable. I think the problem is that bitcoin is in the hands of only a few. I mean talk about centralization of wealth bitcoin pretty much tops everything out there right now.  I see how bitcoin can work online but irl  the chance of having a customer that actually owns bitcoins is like non existent. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 03:59:44
could you give examples of apps like opebazaar ? 
@_date: 2016-04-09 04:10:29
 In my opinion Openbazaar is the first app that's actually trying to  give something to the bitcoin community instead of making a profit off   bitcoin enthusiasts. I would like to see other apps that have that same desire. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 05:46:33
an app store that uses bitcoin as its currency off the top of my head. A micro payment music platform...
@_date: 2016-04-09 00:14:56
Yeah I feel like regulations are stifling bitcoin. Although I must say , I have a lot of hope for bitcoin and open bazaar.  I have a record shop on open bazaar and I just sold my first record today so I'm pretty happy.  Open bazaar is probably the best bitcoin app yet in my opinion I think it has the potential to create an international market for all kinds of stuff.

from what I understand the lighting network is supposed to help with scaling. I'll admit I don't know much about it though. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 03:35:36
sure anyone can buy bitcoin but why though ? I think  Bitcoin's worth right now is purely speculative.  Everybody 's busy building fiat to bitcoin exchanges and stuff like that,  to make a quick buck on   the average joe who thinks he's gonna hit it big  by pouring his cash in bitcoin. If people want bitcoin to succeed then there must be a community or commercial  driven effort to develop  apps that actually serve a tangible   purpose (like openbazaar).  Apps that allow people to exchange goods and services for bitcoin.  Right now i feel like bitcoins real shortcomings aren't about scalability or technical stuff it's about "what can I do with this  bitcoin?"    
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:21:26
I don’t own bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 11:54:40
Why would not owning bitcoin invalidate anything I have said... Again no logic...   If anything I have no vested interest in bitcoin so I'm better positioned to form an unbiased opinion.
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:34:42
Based on what ? The only thing behind your beliefs is conjecture.  “Because I trust bitcoin I will be greatly rewarded” What type of logic is that?
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:38:06
Moving to a different system only makes sense if the different system is better than the old one. With bitcoin fluctuating up and down, I would not choose to put any savings in it. It seems pretty risky. I don’t buy the “bitcoin is a reliable way to store money over a long period of time” statement at all.
@_date: 2018-09-03 18:37:33
That's not who I was criticizing. I'm not criticizing companies or people who want to make bitcoin better by fixing it's problems or running a business that accepts bitcoin... All I'm saying is that the bitcoin community has a major B.S. problem.  
@_date: 2018-09-03 18:14:47
People on this subreddit are  blinded by their wishful thinking.
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:30:42
Yes I misspelled losing. If thats the major gripe you have with my post, I don’t believe your opinion to be very constructive. Also I’ve never tried to sell ETFs as a solution...
@_date: 2018-09-04 09:18:08
Pretty funny.

@_date: 2018-09-04 11:51:05
good joke!
this subreddit isn't subjective at all...
I'm not saying that bitcoin itself is bad, I'm just saying that it's not at all where it needs to be at for adoption  and that it's community is cancerous.   Maybe it was released way too soon... 
"bitcoin will be worth 100 000$ in 2019!!!!!!" BLABLABLABLA. 99% of pure idiocy when it comes to anything bitcoin related.
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:32:30
why can bitcoin only handle 2 transactions/ sec  ?

this video is SHIT. How about making a video that takes the common Ebayer  through a demo, explaining how the software works and it's  advantages compared to traditional services? 
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:09:39
can you send any amount of bitcoins to another wallet or is there a minimum ?
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:06:58
Ok. I understand now. Another question: Once all the bitcoins are created i don't see how mining could be profitable. But mining is required to process the transactions. So how will the bitcoin network funciton?
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:49:49
sure i'll call it begging no shame in that. Why do you think begging is wrong ?
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:56:45
yes. I hadn't realized that.
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:14:11
Actually. You are right. If online begging was more accessible.  I'm sure it could help alot of people in need. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:00:51
Yes. I am now an online beggar.
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:35:51
Ok. Is mining profitable given the proper hardware? 
From what I understand mining is  required for the bitcoin network to function. I was wondering if people don't gain money from it won't we see a decline in the number of miners in the long run ? to the point were the computing power required to process transfers isn't enough?
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:28:34
how is the transfer fee determined ? 
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:10:18
unless the transfer fee becomes more expensive?
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:25:57
Same here. I just begged for money on this subredit. Someone sent me 0.122971.mBTC  
With the fee it amounts to 0.071 mBTC in my wallet. I can only transfer 0.06 mBTC with the 0 fee option so i guess the fee is always superior to zero.
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:42:44
I don't trust dollar / bitcoin exchanges. There is nothing wrong with asking for a fraction of a bitocin just to get started.  
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:06:22
The whole argument that Bitcoin has to flourish because the internet did is stupid. Even people like Andreas M Antonopoulos keep repeating that same flawed argument. Nobody knows where the bitcoin is heading towards only time will tell  and trying to predict it's success based on another technology just seems wrong.  Yes bitcoin is awesome but in the past numerous technologies were better than others and yet they failed. Example Betamax vs VHS. Yes banks are crap and bitcoin is better but the vast majority of people still use banks(currency). This doesn't mean that the bitcoin will fail but it certainly doesn't mean that it's success is certain.  
@_date: 2015-08-21 19:46:04
Dudes come on, stop with these shitty  internet posts , it sucks. 
I see hundreds of shitty posts like this daily that ruin this subreddit. keep all your shitty propaganda to yourselves. "X said 30 years ago that internet will fail so now everyone who is unsure about bitcoin is STUPID".  Bitcoin and The internet are very different things and even though i love bitcoin just because internet took off doesn't mean bitcoin will evolve the same way the internet did. DOWN VOTE ME IF YOU WANT, BUT PLEASE STOP POSTING THIS GARBAGE AND RUINING IN THE PROCESS. LET THIS SUBREDDIT BE A PLACE OF INTELLIGENT DISCUSSION AND NOT SHITTY PROPAGANDA THAT SUITS YOUR VIEW.  
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:23:52
some people on this subreddit are biased and upvote because these types of posts make them feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Bitcoin is great but some arguments put forth by it's community aren't always true.

Maybe I am the only one but I get the impression that this guy kinda talks crap. Is it ever going to be released? I'm not convinced. Is it going to be open source ? If you interested in open source decentralised and mesh networks you might want to checkout these few projects.
