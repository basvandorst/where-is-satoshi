Great help, thanks
@_date: 2016-08-30 01:58:18
I'm hearing disturbing rumours they might be expanding to Mexico :+)
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:46:24
You mean from Bitwala or from Bitchain?
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:07:26
According to  their volume used to be around 6 btc a day, that's not much. However, I wonder if someone exploited a vulnerability. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 05:56:45
Their price ticker is wayyyy off as well...
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:40:26
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:03:42
Still down

Hey! Your valuable input is needed here.
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:06:27
AH! The eternal optimist :)

Almost any work on securing 120 k coins is cheaper and easier than losing them. The industry will do whatever it takes to stop losing millions.

Definitely will if I get close to the area – thanks! (edit: format)
@_date: 2016-08-30 02:59:07
I agree with all of that. Using Bitwala to pay for my registration was great, I was hoping there were other tricks. Very disappointed that Bitchain's ATMs are not two way...
@_date: 2016-08-30 01:47:34
I was worried that was the reason...
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:21:49
Bitstamp recovered and is still a "big 4" exchange. You can't predict what will happen. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 16:54:28
Good idea – will do.

Pretty awesome.

It helps that the MXP is diving and government support is flimsy at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:56:11
Price usually drops in January

Fraud protection on these cards is not that good.
@_date: 2016-11-30 20:43:58
You can use things like bitwala to pay via bank transfer, this works well for some things (in Europe). You can now pay train tickets in Switzerland directly with Bitcoin as well, and using cheapair.com you can pay for flights. For most other things, a good CC is better, gets you rewards, has fraud protection and avoids some of the pitfalls you mention (i.e., crappy exchange rates).
From personal experience, looking for restaurants or pubs that take Bitcoin is kind of a wild goose chase.
I always carry around 100 US in BTC in my phone's wallet for emergencies.
@_date: 2016-09-15 21:52:59


Good example of MVP. I think you're starting to understand :)
@_date: 2016-09-15 16:58:50


We don't, aside from Bitcoin et al. A program can manage a wallet autonomously and that would be impossible with a bank account. Ownership is not the point.


Stop it with the condescending comments. Personal attack is the weakest form of argument.
@_date: 2016-09-14 11:48:28
90% of little is still little.
@_date: 2016-09-14 19:10:55
The only decent answer is because a) Bitcoin would be easier to program and provide interesting alternatives (automatically paying by the mile, being payed by another 'thing' in the IoT realm) and b) a car could not technically own money, but it could own Bitcoin – although at this point, both of these are completely irrelevant.
@_date: 2016-09-15 15:02:20


I didn't mean charging by the mile, I meant paying by the mile.


So, a car that has its own wallet, pays for its own gas, repairs, and gives you the profit seems stupid to you? It's not a matter of who owns what, obviously you own the car and its profits. It's a practical matter, in which the 'thing' handles its resources autonomously.
tl;dr: It's not the same thing to give a 'thing' access to your bank account than to give it a wallet. (edit: format)

Also,  topping up your Circle account requires volitional action. i.e., moving money from your actual account is still a hassle, using a CC has its own inconveniences (and fees) + The recipient now has money in Circle, which they may or may not want.

Fraud protection is weaker in debit cards
@_date: 2016-09-14 11:47:17
Don't really think so, it'd probably be easier to buy something like a wallet and integrate with their own sources of funding. Remember Apple has already got a way to fund it's user's balance with loads of CCs.

MexPost is getting better. A couple of years back they introduced an online tracker for their premium service (optional), it's still rather backward, but you can always use UPS, DHL, Estafeta or any package delivery service.
@_date: 2015-09-28 23:51:19
It seems that way. But I'm curious regarding what they are doing with it. Did they implement an inhouse service, did they partner with someone?
@_date: 2016-10-01 23:15:11
Same thing we do every night, Pinky...
@_date: 2015-09-28 19:07:07
I wonder if they integrated with a particular company... if not, it would be interesting to know who's behind this.
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:49:31
Legit use case for Bitcoin. Better than just speculating, albeit, with a little extra risk... 
@_date: 2015-09-29 16:16:07
Too early to know for sure, but seems like you can't.
@_date: 2016-10-26 05:24:35
Not really a good talker.
@_date: 2015-10-12 17:14:02
It's true :-)
Went through the checkout (crappy on-boarding) and they offer the option, seems pretty neat.
@_date: 2015-10-12 17:51:51
I think it will work the other way around: Mexicans who use Bitcoin will now go to FAMSA. Probably the only mainstream place where you can get electronics for BTC in Mexico.
@_date: 2015-10-13 14:56:20
I don't know for sure, but I wouldn't think so. They have a LOT of stores and merely explaining what bitcoin is to their employees would be a big undertaking.
