to get BitFinex to clarify.. to end the rumor once for all. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:50:26
an anonymous entity which calls itself a BitFinex insider is sending this mail to media houses. Can't really say if it is trolling or speaking truth.

a well-sketched analysis by First Global Credit's Rep Marcie Terman on Bitcoin companies' responsibility to protect its customers.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:55:39
sorry.. that was a typo.. :)
@_date: 2016-04-22 06:20:30
take the whole world in consideration.. then hell yeah..
@_date: 2016-04-08 09:13:02
truly I feel rather angry about this
@_date: 2016-04-15 11:52:38
the solution is included.
@_date: 2016-04-04 12:53:57
and not for Bitcoin.. the gap is widening up I guess.
@_date: 2016-04-21 13:01:56
I first used it to buy 100 dollars for 80 dollars. :)

how many times will you write the same article nasdaq
@_date: 2016-04-20 06:32:33
bitsquare? its coming out next week i guess.
@_date: 2016-04-13 12:17:42
Does it mean ChangeTip is finished?
@_date: 2016-04-10 20:19:27

@_date: 2016-03-07 05:41:57
u r taking that Tokyo underground metro clip too seriously.. :)
@_date: 2016-03-11 17:12:27
Its a false alarm. I had contacted Vogogo. They replied me with this:
"Not sure where you heard this but it is NOT correct. As part of a recent customer service "house cleaning" process we decided to terminated several very small clients that were simply not utilizing our services in a material way but were often tying up our support resources. Over the years we had accumulated enough small clients where 75%+ of our customer support resources were going towards clients that were charged less than $50/mnth. Not an effective way to operate. 
Hope this clarifies things."

Dear Obama, if we cannot see your d*ck chopped then you probably are walking around with a potential raping tool in your pants.
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:52:07
its Russian way of being politically correct.. :D
@_date: 2016-03-04 11:46:18
only a techno-savvy country like Japan could understand the true meaning of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-21 12:22:12
Bitcoin is Hindu - look its reincarnated again!
@_date: 2016-03-28 10:06:22
what's up with this one? could anyone translate?
@_date: 2016-06-09 05:58:48
with job description implying bullshitting, I don't think if any politician will ever go jobless. :)
@_date: 2016-06-28 12:23:36

glad I had you after all. :D

Hello benperrin117, NewsBTC will resume using tradingview charts from tomorrow onwards. We truly appreciate your views. :)
@_date: 2016-06-27 13:18:36
good timing

Federal Reserve is the biggest Ponzi scheme ever. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 20:17:01
wait until they throw rising Google Trends at our face. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 09:32:30
does anybody realize the number of Bitcoins that are dedicated every day to purchase ShitCoins. I guess these bag holders are the ones who dump in the face of low demand. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 18:54:09
I am in Delhi. I might run a search at their current address if complainants provide me some more details. My id is bitcoinbablu
@_date: 2016-11-17 18:02:09
coming to Goa next week. Let's distribute Bitcoins.. :)
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:43:43
Money laundering was happening way before Bitcoin. I don't understand why these media houses want to make a scapegoat out of the digital currency, specifically when its clear that Bitcoin is semi-anonymous. 
Hope they focus more on the reason of people forcing to funnel Yuan.
@_date: 2016-02-16 14:07:45
the last time I checked it was just US and Philippines. Though their business model is quite open - anybody can join and be a local human ATM. Let's wait for more info on this!
@_date: 2016-02-16 14:31:11
my bad... you are right.
@_date: 2016-02-16 14:29:34
lol they raised the maximum sum last year, according to AngelList.. now we'll see what hype does to companies.

hackers should rather focus on taking terror websites down. :(
@_date: 2016-02-28 12:44:19
he is plainly bullshitting.. 
@_date: 2016-02-17 08:14:50
It won't be possible until the Fed and State laws reach a common conclusion. Bitcoin companies like Coinbase and BitPay already ban user accounts on the first sign of shadiness. The cash means to stay for dinner..
@_date: 2016-09-05 12:48:59
Jack doesn't die in this one. :) 
@_date: 2016-09-16 13:35:18
that would give them absolute control btw! 
@_date: 2016-09-16 12:05:57
but its a deadlock.. don't know who is "powering" who.. :D
@_date: 2016-09-16 13:34:28
Thanks for cracking the saying, while I was busy watching Don't Breathe. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 11:54:28
this is the best explanation I have ever read. :)
@_date: 2016-09-09 10:45:39
yes! The article clear drew parallels with what actually happens in Bitcoin exchanges, including BitFinex.
@_date: 2016-09-26 18:02:41
not in infant phase.. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 13:23:20
A must read
@_date: 2016-09-16 14:22:10
Was the same with me. Until I read this  Try the translated version..
@_date: 2016-09-13 18:49:45
Gavin has a mind of a traditional financier, but his concerns appear to be genuine. There is a strong need for exchanges to become answerable to their customers, especially when even the good ones like BitFinex are unable to ensure 100% security.
@_date: 2016-09-21 10:29:35
good news. but..

@_date: 2016-10-05 07:40:21
First Global Credit places real trades in real time - all by allowing Bitcoin as collateral.
@_date: 2016-10-20 10:41:11
May he win, may he won't! But Bitcoin will surely win.
@_date: 2016-10-25 11:22:57
Japan, South Korea, India, China.. Asia will drive the Bitcoin demand.
@_date: 2016-10-05 08:17:53
 have a read
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:06:54
The moment you realise, I have been here.
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:27:53
And they thought my Bitcoins were bad.
@_date: 2016-05-05 10:11:57
i have the read the same title on NewsBTC.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:31:51
One of the biggest mysteries in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has been solved, as Satoshi Nakamoto is none other than Dr. Craig Wright. Or that is what everyone would like us to believe, even though most of the information is based on hearsay and not actual verifiable proof.
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:50:36
Bitcoin Unlimited is its own enemy.
@_date: 2016-07-13 13:36:26
Rest in piss, rumors.. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 11:22:48
hell yeah!
@_date: 2016-07-13 07:22:32
It has now become important to rope in mainstream media and strip these motherfuckers for good. Enough with their biased stance against Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-07 10:34:39
a good buying opportunity imo.
@_date: 2016-07-07 10:53:24
u mean BitStamp downloaded this malware into your system? Please elaborate further.
@_date: 2016-07-14 06:32:03
i hope they dont end up blaming Bitcoin for that also. :X
@_date: 2016-07-14 06:33:21
spot on. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 08:25:58
