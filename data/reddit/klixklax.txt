Your $$ worth goes up but you can lose btc which will ruin you when btc drops but alts don’t increase.

Do some research and learn the technical knowledge as best you can. It’s not rocket surgery. Spend some time reading and learning. Research , research, research - then write.
Edit: also probably easier to set the stage with your essay with something along the lines of “bitcoin will will disrupt the modern financial industry (it won’t)” and then explore what obstacles both bitcoin and the financial industry could face during that journey.  That’ll give you a shit tonne to write about. Then your issue is containing  it to 5k words.

The technology doesn’t matter to a certain extent. What matters is the willingness for others to recognise it as a store of value. If war breaks our or the government or banks starts having issues like Venezuela or Greece then people will go to bitcoin as a store of value to be able to xfer their funds across borders. 
The technology doesn’t matter to people. They care that someone else will buy it when they need to sell it. 
At least that’s mine opinion.

Depends on what the ‘tech’ is. Eth/Neo (many others) for example are not meant as currencies. 90% of the rest are bullshit schemes to crowdfund weird projects. Zcash is one of the only ones with some actual decent tech behind it as a pure currency. Tech doesn’t make a currency - adoption does. But who knows what the hell the future holds.

Here is your lesson on market cap. I make a coin called Crapcoin. Supply of 1,000,000,000,000 coins. I sell 1 coin on an exchange for $0.10 all other coins remain unsold.  Crapcoin total market cap = $100,000,000,000.
I sell another coin for $0.01. Market cap is now down ~$90,000,000,000. 
Literally only $0.11 actually has been traded. But it looks like billions has been lost. 
That’s how you lose $200 billion in a day.

If you have accounts on both perhaps. But not for btc/usd as you can’t transfer the usd from bithumb to gdax. You could sell it into usd or krw but then you can’t transfer it back so you’d have to buy some other coin to transfer it back. And they are at selling at a premium so you will end up getting less say Eth or Ltc because the prices are all high.

@_date: 2018-01-06 05:13:29
The question you should ask when looking at services in the crypto world is “how do they make money?”. Everyone is skimming off the top - cloud mining services, exchanges etc. 
When you purchase off an exchange you get market price minus a small fee and transaction fee when you withdraw it.
With cloud mining you get a nominal amount of btc which will dwindle based on difficulty eventually leaving your contract useless. 
Nothing comes for free. Just depends on how much you want to pay for a service and what environmental impacts that service is vulnerable to.

A comma I understand. Like $100,000,000.96 for a hundred million and 96 cents. But decimal points all over the show is just bloody ugly. It’s not just the US, in Aussie, Uk, and NZ we use the same as US - it just makes sense. It’s everyone else who is wrong I tell ya!!
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:56:14
Yes I agree now is early. But gone are the days where you could mine with your cpu. For bitcoin at least. You missed the boat getting in cheaper and making a load on bitcoin ten years ago. Your time is now so don’t beat yourself up about the past. Deal with the now. Invest what you can afford and hold.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:15:26
In a sense they are the same and different. Blockchain is the underlying technology of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Essentially is is a chain of blocks in which each block records the transaction history of the network and acts as a decentralised digital ledger much like a much would have a ledger recording who sent money to whom. Bitcoin is a crypto currency that utilises this blockchain technology. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:58:47
Hang on you mean sell your bitcoin for bitcoin? You know 1 btc on bithumb = 1 btc on gdax right? You would literally lose money due to exchange fees and transaction fees.

Different market, different demand. When demand is higher than supply the price goes up. Obviously there is a lot of demand in Korea and its local market is struggling to meet it. Conversely the demand and supply are met at the current price of 16.5k in the US/EU markets due to more open market perhaps.

That’s the whole point of why people are wary of holding btc on exchanges. If you don’t hold the private key or seed then they are not yours and you are trusting the exchange to send them when you request. But they own them as they are in their wallets to which they hold he private key for.

@_date: 2017-12-28 23:58:35
Doesn’t mean it can’t happen dude. Losing $1k isn’t likely to ruin you.Losing $500k might. So people dealing in larger sums rightly don’t trust exchanges due to past issues with similar exchanges. And also because even if they say your cash is backed or insured who wants to fucking go through that drama. Easier to. It hold it on an exchange if you don’t need too.
