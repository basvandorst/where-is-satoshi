That is, in a more aggressive way, what the article is hinting at: the epistemological dimensions of "value" from differing perspectives of goldbugs, bitcoiners, etc.

It's more than just tradition if it's still being used as currency.

yeah definitely... as the article says, we're releasing the Bitcoin over Gold article tomorrow... Thanks to your input it should be a stronger article and more to your liking anyway

Yes, I believe that Gold currently has a globally higher level of trust over Bitcoin, therefore it's an advantage. 
No, I did not say that gold won't be replaced by something better. I believe Bitcoin is better in many respects, actually. But Silver, Platinum, Copper and other precious metals don't have any astoundingly better features.
Thanks for the input about confiscation, and most scenarios depend on how an owner stores his/her gold. 
But in such scenarios there's no difference:
If you hide gold, somebody knows you have it but don't know where it is, and they have a gun to your head, they can get your gold, right?
If you hide bitcoin, somebody knows you have it but don't know where it is, and they have a gun to your head, they can get your keys, right?

"The Gold Reserve Act outlawed most private possession of gold, forcing individuals to sell it to the Treasury, after which it was stored in United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox and other locations."

There are parts of the article that refer to gold as its own currency class, as fiat and crypto-currencies are other classes of currency. History is always taken into account when talking about gold since it is the first of these currency classes. 
Besides, saying "it's only tradition" is much like the argument "there's no intrinsic value"... We know it may be only a belief, but that sociological faith combined with utility of transfer gives a currency value. Gold has that.
