We gave away 500btc in 2015 to over 300k bitcoin newbies. The goal for 2016 is 2000btc - but it depends on the price :)

Can you ELI5 this for me? What does a score mean?

We're in Thailand, Chiang Mai - myself and the whole BitcoinAliens.com team - but we just live and work there, we don't buy and sell bitcoin and there's no real life community.
@_date: 2015-12-22 17:30:19
Yes, total nightmare for us right now, trying to pay 15-20 btc a week to publishers for advertising, and then 20,000 - 30,000 people a week for their faucet claims - if the bitcoin network can't even deal with this volume then it's seriously limited already even with just this infantile volume :(
@_date: 2015-12-27 11:35:09
buytrezor.com - im sure they deliver to you, with 16btc you NEED this - or at least learn about paper wallets or exporting your private keys and storing them offline - im sure breadwallet is really safe, but it isn't if you lose your phone or laptop.
@_date: 2015-12-23 08:18:58
But this is where the demand is? It isn't with a college kid in the USA , it is with the unbanked and 10s of 1000s of people in developing nations who want bitcoin because their governments are (even more) corrupt and their currencies are crashing or worthless on the world market. If you remove access to bitcoin for these people then transactions and daily usage drops massively and the acceptance and growth of the whole remittance market slows down as it's not clear quite how much grass roots demand there is?
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:07:31
Not totally true - unless youre real deep into this and know how to build transactions, or know that you need to - the average mom or non technical person using bitcoin doesn't know this. 
Some services dont even let you pick the transaction fee - and even if they do, again, you need to be technical to be able to estimate the right amount.
Also, some APIs auto calculate it for you - but at today's high transaction numbers per block mine at least is getting it wrong and I have transactions pending for hours.
So, in THEORY yes, but in reality its not obvious at all what to do or why, and this absolutely can't be how things are in 3 years time - it needs to be brainless for the average non technical person.
@_date: 2015-12-31 08:46:09
No this is a lie, slander, we do pay out it was around 13btc this week. I'm in a rush to catch a flight but here is one of our old archived payout wallets - you can see this wallet alone paid out 171btc in a pretty short space of time - look at the transactions, they are sent to batches of 150 people at a time most of the time:
If you have not been paid then either a mistake has been made but we might have labelled you (incorrectly) as a fraudster, cheating us :P
@_date: 2015-12-05 02:55:11
Yes! ME! I made a commitment to start my bitcoin business and either reinvest ALL profit or SAVE ALL profit as bitcoin - I have done - each month, I drain all $ profit and convert into bitcoin for either active use within my business or now some savings - this is for the sites  (bitcoin advertising) and  (bitcoin games/faucets). And soon we are implementing bitpay so that people can pay with CC for advertising - and we will convert all to BTC and spend / save.
@_date: 2015-12-22 13:22:02
Fee market already exists - some of our transactions hang in the air for hours at a time now, even on recommended fee calculations which were previously more than enough :(

@_date: 2015-12-28 23:52:29
- I send around 15+ btc each week to 30,000 bitcoin newbies from our faucets and mobile apps.
- I send out 20+btc a week to publishers who use our advertising network ( - it doubled up ads served/revenue month on month there-abouts for the last 3-4 months.
- I pay 3-4 people a month some of their salary a in bitcoin.
- I've given away 500+ btc over the last 12 months, and paid out maybe 150+ btc to blog owners/bitcoin faucet/freebie site owners as their earnings from advertising
- I see a vibrant bitcoin eco system from my viewpoint!

I've had 1+btc "sweeped" into the Johoe account, and have requested to get it returned from Blockchain.info - this is their response:

Thank you for this information. We require further investigation into this matter, which means we need to verify that this address was generated in your wallet. Unfortunately we can only do this with the wallet identifier + password. Please provide this information along with the total amount removed from the other address.
Be sure to *NEVER* use the compromised bitcoin address again. You should also generate a new wallet at  and never use the other wallet again, since you'll be sharing the password information with us.
This looks like the stupidest idea ever to me - to send them my identifier and password over email (I have other bitcoin in other wallets inside that account... not for long..)
I'm pretty shocked that this is their approach to helping me to SECURE my bitcoin? Is this even allowed / legit?
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:19:59
what other choice do I have, its a missing 1.15btc, i need it back :P
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:15:56
The issue is I have signups to faucets and services which will keep paying into these addresses.. i have literally 100s of them :P
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:06:17
Ok, the issue with the wallet being "empty" is that this is my ACTIVE "hot wallet". I am a bitcoin faucet owner of 2 LARGE faucets, I use this wallet for incoming and outgoing payments and also MANY MANY tiny micro payments daily) - im literally signed up to 100+ other faucets which send me money daily/weekly - so I can't really just completely discard the wallets (theres like 20-30 of them too)
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:05:30
thanks, will move funds and reply later to the support thread when done. Real shame to have to do it like this though.
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:07:17
shit well i often get funds into these other wallets, small amounts but all of the time... i own bitcoin faucets and earn money from other bitcoin faucets using my referral link...
I guess I will import the keys, into another wallet that doesnt really matter still... and PAY from this new "not mattering" wallet to ANOTHER new wallet that I will keep safe and secure with all new, non blockchain originating addresses.
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:04:46
this was by email - an official support ticket raised on their site.
@_date: 2014-12-15 10:43:34
this is not exactly it now but he has the private key now, its still the same, i received money to that address recently still.
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:35:34
Full story: I had 1.15btc "swiped" by the whitehat hacker Jahoe, I followed the bitcoin talk thread and his instruction to contact blockchain to return it.
I did so, and the 3rd email I received from them on the support ticket I raised was this one - requesting I email them my password.. I suppose I'm going to, what choice do I have? But first I'll have to swipe all of the other private keys in this account to a new wallet.. 
Just wanted to share this and ask if this is legit.. this is supposed to be bitcoin and better than banking and paypal, but even ANY bank or Paypal would never ask you to send a password to them. Just this policy is going to cause further problems, losses and phishing for them?
@_date: 2015-05-14 12:27:09
Wow, thanks, Ill drop you a private message, happy to provide any info you need :)
@_date: 2015-05-14 15:26:39
It is advertising funded, basically on a smaller scale I have to hope people click the adverts on the site more than they claim for me... but that is ok, it's the business model of any blogger / content based site webmaster. The bigger picture would be getting 1-1 sponsors.. well, the bigger picture would be getting real mass reach - theres obviously companies like Amazon, Audible, Goodreads etc who make good money from books based websites.. but thats a distant dream, the main real goal is to let people read, spread bitcoin, while making a simple profit and scaling the site :)
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:15:06
In the end it looks like we gave away around 1.5btc today extra - with 120 people commenting with pics of their pizzas :D Winner will be drawn tomorrow.
 
@_date: 2015-05-16 23:28:29
Yes, thanks for the feedback, I want to add this too, it will have to wait though until a "phase 2 redevelopment" as user base grows and profit rises so we can justify though... but were positive :)
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:00:21
Sadly I can't, I'm not rich, or "kickstarter funded". I literally would have no money to pay out without the ads. I have experience though.. I have other popular faucets.. so far I have given away around 145+ bitcoin (I did an AMA on here the other week about this if you check my profile) - so things can get higher volume, and I just need the ads to fund it for me or the project can't exist.
I would love some proper book focused sponsors though - Audible, or GoodReads or things like this :)
@_date: 2015-05-14 12:26:40
I have these daydreams too :) I think the highest profile attempt at sharing the love/money out recently was by Tsu.co, but basically they're just a facebook clone with less of your friends on there, and after personally joining it seemed like I might have to wait for the ice age to come before getting any revenue share from their model.
Now my site isn't perfect (and has a long way to go too) but I think it's possibly an early use example of what else could come - and I think bitcoin and micro transactions are much more suited to this kind of sharing model of business.
..and yeh, wow, get paid to meditate, I'd personally love it if that was a thing too :)
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:27:28
Yes, its hard to get super intelligent with it, at least at this stage - each page, on ANY book just has to be priced up the same otherwise the development cost of this would rocket and I still wouldn't be live.. I've got bigger plans for it if it gets popular and profitable.
Step 1. on my list of things to do better is to get some modern authors to list with us.
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:34:33
I'm not exactly sure, some other skeptic calculated that War and Peace would give you $0.70 - so Jungle Book, I don't know, $0.10?
But we're all bitcoin positive right, thats like $1,000 in 2018's bitcoin price right? 
I would LOVE to be able to revisit this thread after a price rise and make some ridiculous claims about how much we paid people to read The Jungle Book "back before the main, main-iest mainstream spike of 2022" :D
@_date: 2015-05-14 15:23:52
Thanks, what are you reading? :)
@_date: 2015-05-15 08:50:26
Hmm, I can't really say much else except that it really did happen. I acknowledge though that it wasn't the best climate to get started in, but that's just how it happened.
I actually got personally interested in Bitcoin from January 2014 and bought all the way down from $800 to $400. It wasn't till later in the year that I started building this business and faucet collection - Around August/Sept... It was only for tiny money then, but I lost a little. The bulk of the 140+ was paid out between December 2014 and now.
And yes, you are also right that although it's "only" $33k worth now, because some was at a higher price, I do estimate that it was around $40k or so. 
Oh and you're also right, it is all about page impressions averaging, but the math is a little out, we get waaaaay more impressions than that now, but the value per impressions is a lot less than the average rate too.
Hmm, I hope that shows I'm genuine, and if you like then this is the main hot wallet we have paid out from ( more recently, I think since around January, but we had others before that too (the amount is probably much more than 140btc too in truth). And ultimately it is profitable, but not in an instant millionaire type way, theres now a little team of us, so I mostly just use the profit to reinvest and grow.

Hey, I'm not the guy, I didn't make it up, and if he is right, then how wouldn't it (the super computer that provides for us all) be the blockchain evolved? - this is maybe 3000 years in the future.... And, I'm not 100% serious btw.. Just something I saw on reddit ages ago..
@_date: 2015-05-15 08:41:14
Actually we don't really earn that much from Xapo, and as of next week Xapo are removing their affiliate program so they won't get as much exposure, and through our other sites we definitely give a broader overview of different wallets and talk about safety and security rather than just focusing on one.
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:35:06

There was that guy who said he'd been to the future and there was a utilitarian one world government, a floating city that moved around the planet, but mostly we were managed and all our needs provided for by a (telepathic) super computer... probably true, probably an evolved version of the blockchain imo.

@_date: 2015-05-14 23:59:21
Yes would like to do this, I dont know if its a "nice thing" to do too much of though - I prefer the idea of giving whole books to read to my audience.. One way it could work is if an author is struggling to get readership to a trilogy or series, they could give the ENTIRE 1st book and we would heavily link to listings of further books in the series perhaps.
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:54:40

Nice token, but our bitcoin faucets give away £200 every day. If you want to seriously give away bitcoin then drop me a message, it can be a great tool for publicity in real life, but if you do it all just online then you get actual web traffic. I dig the concept though - peer to peer bitcoin lending.. the bitcoin-o-sphere is looking really exciting lately!

Yes, they are all out of copyrite free from age and in the public domain. Although if the site grows then I would love to evolve it to be able to publish new material from real authors with their permission. I think I really need to prove popularity and proof of concept first though.
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:40:11
Yes, thats it, I aim to earn more from advertising than I pay out.
This sounds strange/new, but really its not far removed from the professional blogger model, or any "page impression monetization" - make more in advertising/profit than you spend on user acquisition. I just really bluntly pay actual "cash" to the visitor directly get the visit.
@_date: 2015-05-14 15:02:53
Yes, I just copied it from other faucets as I got started, I think it is the minimum you can pay out from most wallets though actually.

Porn isnt really my thing, my background is in affiliate marketing, so I am thinking how to monetize it, and I just know that Porn is a whole different world - cant have google ads on it, there are whole separate Ad Networks, I cant advertise it in the same places, same way... whole new type of business to learn.. I'd prefer to partner with someone who knows this world if I was to do it... but really, it's just not my thing. I like Bits and Books, not BBWs..

Youre right of course, thats my basic hope - that people will choose me over Gutenberg because illl pay them $0.50 and Gutenberg won't.
But in an ideal world, this is just stage 1 of a 43 stage project. With stages:
- Getting modern books from new authors. Exclusives even.
- Getting real responsible sponsorship from Goodreads, able to do more interesting stuff - giveaways for real books, kindles, competitions..
- Increasing payouts - so that War and Peace payout rate rises to $2.50 and most books are $0.40-$0.60
- Somewhere along the way getting more intelligent controls, getting more intelligent accounts to "trust" longer term, "real" users and pay more after so much activity etc.
It's only 1 month or so old, it's only in beta, no one else is paying anyone to do anything remotely interesting, so give me a break, don't crucify me just yet, just take it for what it is; a fun, cool project that tries to promote something positive, while spreading bitcoin and highlighting a possible usage in the real world.. while spending a few $1000 of my own money to get it going :D
@_date: 2015-05-15 08:52:38
thanks, will take a look at it :)
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:31:25
Yes, but if you read it anyway then you get $0 right? And you pay for the book.. This obviously isn't about everyone quitting work and getting rich reading, but its a way to promote reading and bitcoin.. Anyway, you're mistaken, this is **THE highest paying "to read" site online!** ;)
Edit: And theres also that daft math like - you would have paid $10 for the book, but here you can read it for free, AND you get $0.70 for reading - you are up $10.70 - ...omg this is going to reshape education, math, accountancy.. who knows!

@_date: 2015-05-14 14:43:04
Well we have an affiliate program built in in which you earn 25% of everything that your referrals earn - and this has led to probably 50%+ of our audience so far.. we hope that if it really gets going that we can just keep increasing the payout rate for how much you earn while reading, and everyone is happy - but we probably need real sponsors or basically some kind of deal with Xapo or Coinbase, or Audible for that really... Profit is eluding me so far :D
@_date: 2015-05-14 14:08:57
Yes, I know this, and I also realise that this should should be especially mobile and tablet friendly.. it is my weak side, but if the site continues to grow then I'll put some more investment into it and make it mobile friendly properly - you actually wouldn't believe just how unprofitable this site is right now.. but I think it's got potential :)
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:32:03

If they hand over banking control to me I promise to put faucet captchas on bank visits so that you get paid for visiting the bank.
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:57:37
I had to put google recaptcha on because its the most solid, and it did cut down on a LOT of fraud.. try the pictures one? If you really struggle then send me a private message and I will credit your account some, but you should "get it" and be able to use them. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:49:35
Yes, I have other "pure bitcoin faucets" - same thing, but pays you to do nothing.. I put the payout right up, but then we started to get silly things like 1 guy making 9000 accounts and claiming through robots. It is possible to pay out more, and we have better validation and fraud prevention now... and I do hope to increase the payout into the future.. but it needs to be done incrementally. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 22:07:54
We pay out once a week, it's pretty straight forwards, it will just be sent to that wallet if your balance is over 5500 satoshi, but you have to confirm an email - again, more proof that youre real, we had to implement this step after someone created the 9000 accounts... I'm all up for anonymity as the next person but it's hard to stomach the fraud we got when we were :( If you are really some kind of anonymity ninja though you can PM me and I will make sure you get approved.. generally I can't do this for 100s and 1000s of people as we grow though.
@_date: 2015-05-15 16:26:41
I generally earn that useless "money" stuff we all want rid of... so yeh, then I trade it in for bitcoin and give that out. (Earnings come from advertising)
@_date: 2015-05-22 22:27:46
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:41:04
Thank you, brilliant in that it's a cool idea and is actually working in real use... but thus far insanely unprofitable :)
@_date: 2015-05-14 15:05:41
In reality it is "just a bitcoin faucet". Infact it uses a version of the same script from my other faucets. It pays you every 10 minutes.. so you can turn pages and read, and every 10 minutes you can make a claim, get 250 satoshi, and turn the page too.
Yes, if you just revisit every 10 minutes and don't read then you can "cheat" and claim for free.. but basically that is all bitcoin faucets anyway - "get paid to do nothing" - at least this is something "get paid to read" - but at the very base level it uses the same principles, i.e. it earns from advertising still... so even if people do nothing, it should still be ok.... fingers crossed...
@_date: 2015-05-14 14:15:51

Sadly this was our biggest struggle along the way - its so frustrating to run this business model and have 1000s of robots attack you and have to try and filter out who genuinely is new and interested to pickup some bitcoin and ban the robots and not the users. But we think we got it handled now, or at least the bulk cases of it with this new platform.

Hi, faucet owner here (of  would like to chat to you and see if anything is possible together. Or I'm just happy to share my experience with you and give you some tips..
1. 300 satoshi is still really low.. the biggest faucets out there pay 1000-5000 an hour averages (we're about 3000).
2. If you're serious then you might lose $5-10k while you setup and test and find revenue sources. I did. So did the owner of freebitco.in (the current biggest in the world).
3. You NEED google adsense on there to balance the payout to profit - no other ad networks come close. BUT there is a 5-7 week turnaround from people clicking to you getting money.. you will have cash flow problems.
4. Imo, tying yourself into coinbase might not be the best idea, it excludes people who don't want to give too much KYC? But I do like the idea of email submission rather than wallet... I can' wait till long wallet addresses are a thing of the past.
Anyway, good luck, I'll send my skype to you in a PM now if you want to connect to chat further. Dan

I had a bit of an emergency and felt like they were a safe option for a short time.. things were ok for a couple of days.. 6 days later 10btc lost.. maybe it is just an exposed key from the last time I was hacked, and so I should have known better, but still, just 0 response hurts.
@_date: 2016-06-30 09:23:38
Obviously this is not anyone from Blockchain.info and no funds are returned or not real response received.

Id be more excited about this if I hadn't been hacked / lost coins from Blockchain.info 3x now. The latest time as recently as 2 weeks ago for an amount of 10.4btc ugggh, but even having 1 of their developers on skype received 0 response.
Im not the most technical person in the world, but I'm a 33 year old guy, interested in bitcoin, and if their platform can lose me bitcoin 3x, then what chance does my mom or anyone else have on it? Just a reply would be nice, even to tell me it was my fault if it is. :(
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:31:06

@_date: 2016-12-23 07:15:38
Yeh, well I agree, and I do this, and it's easy to recommend doing this now while the price has gone from $250 to $900, but there was a time that I experienced buying and seeing price go from $800 to $250, the spending power loss on that is worse than any government corruption still.

There are but the problem is allowing cashout to USD not UKR.
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:04:02
No he doesnt want to - thats the problem, just like you wouldnt want to cash out into Indian or Venezualian - he doesnt want the rollercoaster of btc as he needs to live and spend money weekly, but he doesnt want the devaluation of UKR... he wants USD as a middle ground more stable currency (even though us real sickos want to get rid of USD even :P)
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:29:49
Here you're talking about keeping your entire wealth on a centralised exchange, it IS more dangerous than with a bank, even bitfinex actually got hacked for $90million. I actually had 3btc in there at the time, and then when they gave me tokens I lost all trust in them, sold them at $0.25 as soon as I could, and now they are selling at $0.70 or something.. again, I can't really recommend that to anyone to do with money that they depend on to have to go through that and then deal with the aftermath and make a decison based on a crappy and cenralised set of circumstances, perhaps even created to favor the hackers/attackers and prevent the complete implosion, it's no better than a bank like that.

Do you have anyone in Ukraine? How on earth do they accept it and cashout into USD so they can actually live and buy things? Having crazy problems trying this as he obviously doesn't want to cash into UKR.
@_date: 2015-08-25 05:16:46
Yes, got these listed, ideally would like more pure online exchanges, and I know LocalBitcoins is, but I know the conversation with my dad would go - "ok, get them here, you pick who you want to buy them off and see their trust rating, you can meet them in person if you want, but it isnt needed and some people just wont meet"... I'd rather send him to a site, with his card or bank info and just buy "direct".. I'm presenting Local Bitcoins as a backup option or basically an option possible everywhere too.

We earn our full time income from bitcoin affiliate programs and advertising on our bitcoin sites. Theres a lot of junk out there though but the industry is a baby still and we've seen a lot more happening in the last 2-3 months compared to 6-12 months ago! Exciting space to work in :)

Kraken FTW it looks like!
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:08:06
Sure, its all true, I was using blockchain.info - I admit it is my fault, we sent the transactions with a low transaction fee of 20k through the blockchain API, one right after another, right on a busy day of the spam attack - 11th - this is the wallet, you can see all the stuck transactions: 
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:05:52
Can I message you? I still have around 5btc "stuck", and I've been told by several people, even blockchain.info support that I cant get them back - this is the wallet, a LOT of batch unconfirmed transactions: 
@_date: 2015-07-20 08:45:43
I'm just going to leave this here -  (we pay out around 4btc a week just on this app)

@_date: 2015-07-10 16:18:20
In the short term we make small profit of the in-game ads. We just pay out less than we earn but as much as we can. In the long term we're playing the "user acquisition game" - a list of users that were interested in bitcoin in 2015 and 2016, and we do send some marketing about which bitcoin wallets to use, how to store bitcoins safely, sites to get other free bitcoin from etc.
@_date: 2015-07-17 10:54:49
Yes, totally agree with this. I was a victim of the spam attack. 
I'm in the micro transaction niche - we are bitcoin faucets and last week we (stupidly) tried to pay out 8btc to around 10,000+ people in around 70 batch transactions. We LOST it all.
Unrecoverable, just getting rejected by one node, instantly picked up by another, I can't stop it happening, cant pull it back. This also just needs not to be able to happen for when my mum is able to use it, if I'm daft enough to send out with low transaction fees then other people wont even realise or know why their funds didn't go. Really disappointing and frustrating week :( 
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:23:40
Thanks for the feedback :)
1) QR Scanner - why haven't I thought of this... on it..
2) Rewards - you wouldn't believe how low profit this is :P but that being said, our faucets and apps pay out waaaay more than anywhere else - you can take 1500-3000 satoshi from this pretty easily in just a few clicks per hour.. Higher payout could come with real sponsorship from a big bitcoin company, but right now I don' have $millions budget :)
3) Stats - Yes, agree, currently we keep it simple and withdraw everyone, every Friday.
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:42:34
Yes, I'd say 50% you never really withdraw from, another 30% just disappear... they probably setup with good intentions but realise how unprofitable it can be to give away money :P Of the remaining 20% probably over half of those are real low paying... sure, even my "high paying" faucets are low really, lets be honest.. but it is my aim to try and compete and give out as much as I can.
@_date: 2015-04-11 00:24:27
Probably the hardest I've had to work to get a new faucet member. But thank you, there's deadly aliens to be killed - I'm happy to hire you, you're saving the planet ;)
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:23:05
I have a few views on this..
- Mainly that this ACTUALLY ISNT POSSIBLE with "real money" - I can not digitally send 3cents to someone in India - If I earn $1 from someone, then Paypal takes fees of like $0.20 (*estimate, probably innacurate). Sending 3cents is just unfeasible.
- ^ So along with that, no I don't think it loses credibility, I think even something as simple as a faucet can show the power bitcoin has - Every week we pay 10-20k people, between 1cent and $2-5 each. There's no way to pay out $2k to a mass batch of 20k people, for them to all receive it instantly, for fees to be almost non existent to me (and for them to receive the full value) - only with bitcoin/digital currency.
- I think bitcoin is still in beta/early adoption and faucets are still an effect of that - introducing it to people - it is still actually relatively difficult for people to acquire bitcoin.. (not for me or you, but for my mum it sure is... you know, "the untechnical"). We're now at the stage where people know about it and are interested - and faucets are a simple way to introduce it.
@_date: 2015-04-10 20:26:02
Mmm I dont really give single "donations" - it is all micro, automated claims on my faucets - for instance the average claim is around 500 satoshi - but we have 100s of 1000s of claims a week and pay out 10-30k unique wallet addresses per week...
@_date: 2015-04-11 15:40:08
As far as "everyone" is concerned - bank, tax etc, I just run a "publishing company"... "we blog a lot and buy and sell advertising". My bank manager seems happy enough with this simpleton explanation - but to be fair, I'm not running an exchange or looking after peoples money.. I don't think there is any faucet regulation body.. yet :)
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:49:36
Ok thanks, just thought I might be missing something specific to bitcoin or this subreddit.
@_date: 2015-04-11 09:03:34
* re-reply - use code "reddit" to instantly get 500 satoshi :) This was added overnight :)
@_date: 2015-04-11 00:23:39
Its more like 2500 an hour... yes, still low, and you're right, theres not really people making full time earnings or anything, its a way to introduce bitcoin - BUT, there is a lot of traffic from India, Philippines, Russia who do claim more frequently.
There is also a lot of the mentality that "if you claimed from bitcoin faucets 2 years ago, the amounts you claimed then, would now be worth $100s or $1000s.. the very first faucet gave out like 1-3btc... so if it is difficult to BUY bitcoin in your country, but you can get some for free and store it...
@_date: 2015-04-10 22:04:29
Lol. To cut a long story short.. I got interested in bitcoin after the big spike, I bought some at $700... some more all the way down, and I just knew I wanted to get involved somehow.
But I am not technical... My background is marketing, affiliate marketing so I know a little about building online brands and web traffic, and I just sort of stumbled into the micro bitcoin / "bitcoin faucet scene". My instinct was to build an email list of people interested in bitcoin and then to offer them products and services... only on investigating there wasn't much to offer... this really is an industry in infancy.. but along the way I found faucets and saw that people must be running somewhat profitable businesses..
.. I decided to try it.. and then that was another long path of twists and turns that led me here.
.. And the future - to hopefully further grow. But also to use the principle of faucets and the technology to build more mainstream sites..
@_date: 2015-04-11 15:35:57
That's a partnership we have with Xapo.com - if you make a wallet with Xapo we give you an extra 20k satoshi :)
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:53:57
I don't know the data sorry. Yes, the concept is simple, it is more of a faucet than a game, although I think we have some fun with it and it's quite quirky :) Type in "lizard" to the promo codes box and youl get the regenerating lizard 3x in a row, or "seppuku"; it will let you kill Daniel D'Alien on the loading screen... there probably is more to come, but actually we'd also like to launch other apps - more "real games" but have a slight bitcoin payment element to it.
@_date: 2015-04-10 23:06:14
Google pays me best, but actually a really significant part of my earnings come from bitcoin focused ad networks - the best of which is  
I have some affiliate partnerships but they dont pay that well. One that does is a relationship with Xapo.
Your site probably wouldn't work that well to my audience - my audience would click to something else like me, or a banner that says "free bitcoin", but only a tiny tiny % of them would want to buy youtube views.... Tips.. mmm, keyword bidding on networks that allow it for things like "buy youtube views", "buy twitter views" etc.
@_date: 2015-04-10 23:35:44
It varies.. if I actually say then you might see $ signs in your eyes, but it isn't that simple.. I get enough from google to pay out the faucet, AND pay my developer AND one other full time manager. There's a little left over, but I'm of the mindset that I just like doing "this"... I build brands and businesses.. the money goes back in... and the ONLY reason I earn well from Google now because I reinvested 90% of profits every month for 6 months straight - into development work and advertising (but this is still the case.. I like building assets and I think I can build this bigger and cash out at a higher level... OR IDEALLY just keep growing and build some really cool things.. I'm a serial entrepreneur/marketer, I don't really pay myself..

I'm interested to network with bitcoiners in Thailand, we have LARGE bitcoin faucet websites and blogs, and from June our whole little team will be based from Chiang Mai in northern Thailand for 4-6 months.
@_date: 2015-04-10 20:03:15
I really like it! I have this in mind too - my idea to simply be that 10% on top of the claim goes into a separate wallet marked for this month's charity.. It would be easy for me to set this up technically, the real challenge is time as I only have a small team and a ton of development projects and adjustments.
Is funding your only problem? Why cant/wont you monetize/optimize with advertising?

We have to check these once a week and do them in 1 big batch - although there have been tracking problems so there is a delay. I don't know why it says invalid though.. which site are you trying to use it on?
@_date: 2015-04-10 23:01:16
I've actually never really heard of this. But looking at it quickly - no I probably won't - they have their own thing and it's not really anything to do with me, or a charity. Just a "reddit internet lottery"? 
Am I missing the point on what it is or if you are an advocate can you tell me why I should, or how it could integrate?
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:59:59
70% "lesser economic countries". Russia! (for a country thats "banned" bitcoin, it's people sure are interested in it! Then also Philippines, Ukraine, India.
10% America
20% is other "tier 1 counties" combined - Canada, UK, Australia, Eurpoe.
** rough averaging.
@_date: 2015-04-10 19:52:46
If a faucet owner were to do that then it essentially becomes a ponzi where he doesnt want you to earn more than you paid. With ads monetization there is legitimacy and the faucet can carry on forever - as long as it is optimized/balanced.
@_date: 2015-04-11 00:24:48
90% is ad networks, I do negotiate private deals though too.

@_date: 2015-04-10 21:40:37
well not one, but theres no restrictions on my faucets as to who can access them, just need a bitcoin wallet. But it isn't about making people rich, I can't give out 1 whole bitcoin to everyone obviously.. It's just a way to introduce a small amount of bitcoin to people, and I guess to use the technology and to try and progress it in my own way and see what else is possible.. I have a few new pet projects on the side.
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:51:44
I think this is the mentality why faucets are so popular right now - because what you are claiming today, if you believe in bitcoin, could be worth a lot in the future.
@_date: 2015-04-11 09:02:36
Sorry it takes a lot of work, and also my faucet script is my own unique creation. It would sort of be too expensive for me to sell it to you or not worth my time to install it. There are free scripts you can use to get started - Xapo has a faucet script on Github, Microwallet used to be the best, Faucetbox is another possibility.
@_date: 2015-09-30 16:21:52
would get expensive - im hoping theres an out of work bitcoin enthusiast who can drive me 9-6 each day.. probably wishful thinking..
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:55:48
This is probably the typical experience of 99% of new faucets. One thing that often doesnt help is the new faucet owner trying to compete with top payout levels straight away.
1. You need google ads.
2. Add adbit.co - they pay in bitcoin (but it is slow to scale up to where people actually bid on you.
Start small, average out yesterdays earning to todays cash out.
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:58:03
Previously, on and off we have spent a LOT of time, although some of it is in taking a step back and working on systems to identify fraud so the actual removal is faster.
@_date: 2015-04-10 23:14:28
1. I pay the fees.
2. I don't.. I dont actually know precisely :O .. I could do the math ** I'm doing the math VERY loosely here, I've just looked and I basically pay batches of 150 people. I use mass pays so the transaction is 1 transaction fee per "batch" - so to pay 150 people it is 20k satoshi. I typically do a minimum of 100 batches... so lets say it is 0.02btc per week in transaction fees to pay 15k people.. ** very rough estimating (*** makes me realise I should possibly be forcing only a 10k transaction fee to save a fair bit).
3. Average amounts vary, I change it depending on the bitcoin price... when I started out 250 satoshi an hour was high (when price was $600ish), now, on 1 of my sites I pay 250 every 15 minutes (weekend bitcoin) but on Alien Faucet you can claim every 5 minutes and the hourly average it works out to is around 2600.
4.Dont know the average amounts claimed lifetime per user.
5. mmm, again roughly, I have had around 400k wallets register at both of my faucets combined.. I can only estimate that I have paid out at least over 100k... It might be 200k of them... 100k is safe I think.
6. Yes, sadly fraud is my biggest problem. There are people  who make 5000 accounts, who claim with robots. I have measures to stop it now, but it has been a big problem for me in the past. I can't outline my countermeasures as that will help people to avoid them - but there are automated elements and manual elements too.
@_date: 2015-04-11 15:37:43
I actually LOVE aliens :) I'm a big conspiracy fan and especially alien stuff. I always wanted to then flip it and have you as the Alien, killing corrupt world leaders. Or giving out facts about "real aliens" like the Sirians and the Annunaki etc :D hehe .. But I don't think that is likely now as our "thing" seems to be established and we have a little family of aliens now with Daniel D'Alien as the head of the family.. and people seem to like them :)
@_date: 2015-04-10 22:57:57
I started out super small. My initial investment was around $600 - it took me a couple of weeks to lose this.. I think in month 3 I made like £6 in one day.. sounds pathetic, but it was a jump up from nearly nothing.. I "figured out" how to position the ads, the right amount to pay out... 
.. and from then on I basically earn more from ads than I pay out a little less than I bring in...but then there are other costs on top too, i.e. I have a developer working with me full time.. And over time it has scaled up so I'm now one of the highest paying.
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:39:14

I'll answer this one, this is Dan from BitcoinAliens (the publisher). We pay out every Tuesday :) And we have been for over a year now, with pretty few hiccups.

@_date: 2015-04-10 19:35:28
It probably is already more than 140. 139 is the conservative figure that I can absolutely say with 100% confidence.. there is other amounts, un-tracked, lost in time :) * And we pay out around 7-10btc a week now so it will pass 150 soon :)
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:31:44

Lol, I know the feeling, investing near the peak is how I first got interested in bitcoin. So I say I've given away $32,900, but that's today's price - the prices I bought at, it's probably more like $45-50k.. Didn't think I could really claim that though.
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:57:17
Personally I'm in the red too - and the profit on this is small too - small as I choose to reinvest it to build by "bitcoin websites portfolio" and scale up..

Yes, 100% we were hacked, no glitch, this wasn't our address and the coins have moved on - to also not our address. We also saw changes being made with the hacker putting things back to normal while we were investigating.. 100% this was a hack.

Hi thanks for the post - this is ours, it is legit, between these apps and our web faucets (the whole Bitcoin Aliens family of properties) we have paid out over 500btc over the last year. You're not going to get rich but you can earn a few 1000 satoshis and get an intro to bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-19 00:14:27
We've got 5x in total, they are all linked from here:  , the most popular "Free Bitcoin" has had over 500k installs in both stores combined and is often top 5 for a search of "bitcoin" - it's probably our simplest and highest paying too, almost just a button you press and it gives you some bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-11-06 02:07:24
We've had 3x apps in the Apple store for 3+ months now:  
Yes, the team was actually accepting of them, had a few questions but they absolutely know that we pay out bitcoin and had no problem with it.
We actually give out around 5-7btc a WEEK between these 3x apps now, and if you search for "bitcoin" the app "Bitcoin Free" is 2nd/3rd in the Apple store.
Happy to answer any questions, and would love to chat to other bitcoin apps developers, especially gaming ones, and we're working on a widget to allow any game to pay out btc, if you're interested in this then connect with me too please :) Thanks, Dan

Thanks a lot for this. Ok, so
- Anyone can openly create a new ad, and when you input your banner and link and set the amount of impressions you want you submit it and it shows the price to pay - you can do this openly from here:  - you'll see a unique address is generated each time, starting with a 3, part of our API calls to BlockTrail for accepting payments - in place of the unique address they were just ALL that 1Duf address.
- There were 5 ads which were compromised in this way totaling 0.29 in -  - unknowing buyers bought an ad and paid the hacker. It was lucky on our part it wasn't more tbh.

I'm actually in the air right now thanks to the wonders of modern life.. on a China Airlines plane, on my way from Taiwan to San Francisco - and this 25 minute CNN documentary is on the inflight tv selection :) I watched it too and it's ok, a decent intro to bitcoin for newbies, but already a little out of date - filmed when the price was around $600-800 I think last year.
Must be why the bitcoin price and China trading volume up ;)
@_date: 2016-10-19 00:34:23
This is definitely an issue, so we set a higher withdrawal limit, it was previously 5k satoshi, now it is 20k.. due to the rising tx cost though it probably needs to be higher again now. It's pretty frustrating, but probably in the future we will move to a "side-chain"; lightning? our own? our own on the lightning network.. so essentially it is all above board, you can see the tx leaving "us" into a 3rd party side chain connected to the blockchain..... this obviously isn't even out yet. 
Also it is definitely worth noting that you aren't really earning large amounts or saving large quantities of bitcoin from our faucets, they are more for fun or an introduction to bitcoin, and just to sort of showcase what is possible with bitcoin.. I mean even right now this wouldn't be possible with Paypal for example due to the $0.30 starting tx fee per transaction, the inability for MANY countries to have a paypal account or restrictions on some accounts (* I think in the Ukraine you can have a paypal account but you can spend, not withdraw.. :/), and secondly much more will be possible with micro transactions back and fowards in the future with amazing implications for gaming, so we have much bigger plans too :)
