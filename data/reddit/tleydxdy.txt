I'm still reading about how transactions are handled, so... wish someone has the free time.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:26:42
no, Isis use USD
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:33:16
by not creating blocks bigger than 512kb
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:53:40
lmao when someone says that bitcoin core is centralized, fork it you fool. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:06:03
run full node! support back.
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:26:19
altcoin means any cryptocurrency that's not bitcoin if I'm not mistaken, how can u make generalization about that. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:19:00
the code is on GitHub, do it. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:01:43
mint seems pretty good, my gf use it. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:00:13
I wonder who is doing the prove of work. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:42:03
I don't see why you can't. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:02:45
vote with your feet. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:01:57
why? it's not like they won't get the block in less than 10 min. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:25:37
you mean USD?
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:03:11
if it's a spare computer, I recommend you try out Linux, freedom!
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:30:00
In my understanding, joining a punzie scheme is not illegal, right?

@_date: 2018-01-03 21:56:06
Great news, plz ditch Intel next
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:08:50
what makes ln not work on pruned chain? I'm confused. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:38:43
usdt is backed by USD isn't it?
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:40:42
the only difference being you won't be helping new nodes build their chain and lose the ability to -txindex and -rescan. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:15:19
they can hold usdt I assume?
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:59:15
they are stealing
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:44:22
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:08:19
you can prune the blocks for light weight nodes, just that it won't be a full node. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:09:10
because there are people that don't update their software.

"This planet has — or rather had — a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn’t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And so the problem remained” -- The Hitchhikers’ guide to the Galaxy
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:00:39
what are u talking about? I guess portal aren't good game after all. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:54:14
I'm not sure, how to check for this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:34:34
I don't understand this, I've never had any bad experience using bitcoin on steam. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:40:01
I was basically counting on that; if it got confirmed before it times out great, if not at least it's gone. Is shutdown my client the only way to stop broadcasting? seems like it should be a feature. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:23:48
Because nobody is using segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:00:34
wouldn't it encourage people to not spend their coins? right now I think the exchange rate change is covering this up. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:03:45
I ran my fullnode, use segwit since core support, support block size increase, you tell me. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:52:47
I can't stop my client from broadcast a transaction? I guess I have to unplug my cord. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:30:04
I'm just describing the process
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:23:40
and then?
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:18:33
no, it keeps going. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:30:53
you could pay one off payments via multiple channels chained together, at least that's the idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:15:14
seems much easier if they just switch to Linux. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:00:37
No matter it's raise or dip, mempool get fucked. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:10:13
pretty soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:59:31
if you are unhappy with the current maintainer, you can click fork and maintain it yourself, if people prefer your version there you go. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:32:30
won't old transactions get thrown out people's mempool if the sender and the receiver don't broadcast it for some time?
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:13:37
gov is not a uniform entity. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:18:09
seems like you don't know what difficulty is, look it up.
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:22:12
make bitcoin cash again
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:20:24
scripts are dangerous, read before use. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:49:10
you do know that there's a thing called difficulty right?
@_date: 2018-03-26 05:11:17
exactly what newly developed system needs. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 05:10:31
if this is the case, it'd be a problem. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:44:57
of cources
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:17:35
half 42?
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:18:00
half 42
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:58:17
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:57:47
if there could be a algo that is based on hardware decoder in consumer electronics, it could certainly be valuable. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:56:15
this news sounds like a nothing burger. according to the Chinese source, he means the software must be developed by some centralized organization, still misunderstanding, but not what the news was tring to imply. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:34:09
dirty media
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:10:07
member last time they issued new cash to "deal with corruption"? guess who actually benefited, they aren't dumb. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:21:06
doesn't work if it's logarithmic
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:54:59
the thing is, we don't even know if the measurements was in ordinal scale, interval scale or ratio scale, and even if it's in ratio scale, the unit's meaning. so comments on the ratio of two numbers could have any to no meaning. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:37:44
ever heard of a unit called decibel?
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:47:52
not if the units are logarithmic. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:35:23
yep, price also has unit, what is it. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:55:41
buy or trade?
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:05:14
goes nicely with awesome wm
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:19:49
ratio to what? it couldn't be anything on the chart since they aren't 1
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:23:28
the graph didn't give a unit, did it?
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:56:25
now you get it, without stating the unit, the graph makes no sense, more practically, the ratio could be different when trading using different currency. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:21:02
how can you tell?
