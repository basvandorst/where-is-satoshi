If you could buy a house with -1% interest rate, would you bother putting anything down? Or paying cash even if you had it on hand? 
The interest rates on US bonds issued are actually lower than inflation right now, the gov is `realizing negative interest bonds`. It'd literally be stupid not to pay via debt. The USA has complete ability to make payments. This is a non-issue. 
`In the late 1940s through the early 1970s, the US and UK both reduced their debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking advantage of negative real interest rates, but there is no guarantee that government debt rates will continue to stay so low.`

Psst. There's exactly zero requirement that a stock offer dividends. In fact, one of the biggest market caps in the world Google (Alphabet) has offered zero dividend for almost it's entire existence.

I never said not to pay attention. This would just be a catastrophically stupid decision on our part. It's not like we'd have lost our ability to borrow, or pay, motivating it. It'd be pure idiotic politics. That's certainly not something to ignore given the current climate, but I find it highly unlikely we'd willfully create a global depression, for what?

Jesus, this is some heavy fear mongering. Not happening. Also, as a % of GDP, the USA isn't even that badly in public debt, nor is it at the highest levels it's been (WW2 was over 100% GDP in public debt). Ease off the weed. You're paranoid.    
 
Edit: what's more, debt is currently at a negative effective interest. Decades have gone by without surplus where the deficit reduced because of this.
