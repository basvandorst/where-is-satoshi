So it means above 0.000140 in fees?
I am not quite sure if I undestand it propperly.
I sent around 0.01BTC and set fee of about 0.00025. I happened about 3 hours ago, but still not a single confirmation.

Wow, thank you for this explanation. Now I know a lot more about this process. How do I know/calculate how big my transaction is, how much spaces it takes?

What happens to transactions that have very low fees lets say 1satoshi/byte. Do they get stuck for ever?
