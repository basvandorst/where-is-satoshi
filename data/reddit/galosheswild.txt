Can someone please explain why it's so beneficial to join a huge pool such as BTC Guild as a miner?  My current understanding is simply that pools help decrease variance.  As long as a pool is large enough to mine a block every day or so, isn't that plenty of variance smoothing for miners...?

You may want to put them in cold storage.  Make it inconvenient to access them and you'll be less likely to sell, or even be tempted/distracted by the price.

There are 5.82 billion ounces of gold currently mined in the world.  There are 16.2 million bitcoins currently mined.  That means to get to similar units, we should group gold into 359.2 ounce gold-units.
Therefore there are 16.2 million gold-units in the world.  One gold-unit currently sells for $441,456.  Compare this to one bitcoin-unit which currently sells for $1280.
Still a ways to go guys.

Interesting theory.  What would you consider a sane reaction to ETF approval be?

Oh my god, the commas, in that article, make me want, to throw, up.

The market cap of gold is orders of magnitude larger than bitcoin.  It's not even close.  Gold presently dwarfs bitcoin.

This.  Learn your commas tedjones :)

I was asking what you thought might happen if the ETF were approved.

New users don't have bitcoin so the only sensible thing to google is "buy bitcoin".  People who have bitcoin understand the markets and don't google things like "sell bitcoin"

I'm not really worried about dividing it.  I just don't want all the coins to vanish in the event.  I was hoping to come up with a solution that avoids any kind of legal trust and the likes.  Just some elegant cryptographic idea.

This happened almost 3 years ago as well

My friend was suggesting some kind of dead man's switch.  Where every 6 months or whatever I punch in the password and it resets.  If it didn't reset then it allows the password I give my family to begin working.  Are you aware of any feature like that for a bitcoin smart contract?

I only recently noticed the fees becoming non-trivial.  Before, minimizing fees was a matter of cents.  Now I find myself trying to consolidate transactions, and asking myself if I need this transaction to go through within the next few hours or not.
You might argue "Oh you're just being cheap", but the fact is it's rising fast and doesn't seem to be slowing.  We could realistically be looking at $.50 or $1 fees within a year.

As other have mentioned, there is some variance in how long it will take.  If you send a large enough fee, it will average to about 40 minutes.
Only the first confirmation hinges on your fee.  This is because the first confirmation comes from the block which actually contains your transaction.  If you send too small a fee, the next several blocks might "skip" your transaction.  So it can sit unconfirmed for hours possibly.
Once you get the first confirmation, you are guaranteed to continue getting confirmations every ~10 minutes.  This is because your transaction has now been included in the blockchain, and it's just a matter of ensuring your transaction doesn't get overwritten (this would only happen in the event of a double-spend, so would never happen to an honest sender... but the recipient doesn't necessarily know that about you so they prefer to wait for a few extra confirmations to ensure no funny business).

You are confusing two different things.
A new block is found, on average, every 10 minutes.  When your transaction takes 10 hours, it's because many blocks are skipping over your transaction.  No matter how high you make a transaction fee, the best you can do is guarantee your transaction will be included in the next block.  Which will average a 10 minute wait.
The average transaction wait will be longer than 10 minutes due to transactions like yours.

It's really difficult to predict price movements.  I would recommend perhaps buying 500e of btc today, another 500e in two weeks, another 500e in four weeks, and your last 500e in six weeks.  Then you average out your entry point a bit.

So for this particular gif, actually not at all.  As King\_Bonio pointed out, it's not just two switching frames.  There are perspective lines dictating the implied direction.  It's not a brain trick, this gif is one-directional.
