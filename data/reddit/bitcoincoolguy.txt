How do you know they are compromised ? 
Do you not have Internet security ? 
Or did you download watch dog torrent or something ?

When we start using bitcoin for everyday use you won't need to buy bitcoin as you will obtain bitcoin for your goods or services... 
Eg I see this ad over there for pizza but with bitcoin..
If everyone will buy this pizza the ower will just pay the delivery boy in btc..

What's a bigot.
Also I was just watching the price hit 650 on my phone but also walking down the city and saw lots of same sex people holding hands and wondered if they had bitcoin haha 
That's all

I want to get bitcoin stickers made up so I can come sick them around my city to create awareness

I say. When I first heard about bitcoin it was $8 then after a year or 2 it went up past $1000
That's usually enough

Does it pay well? I was speaking to a Bali market store operator and he was on around $2 an hour

Can you explain this a little bit more I don't understand 
If I were to transfer 1btc to a cold wallet 
I will get 1btc..
So I haven't paid any fees .. 
So there is no fees 
Or will there be fees when there are no btc left to mine.
