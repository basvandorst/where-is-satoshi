I reckon part of Bitcoin's appeal is that it has been given this mystical creator who is meant to wise and Asian like how western movie portray old Asian actors as the masters. For all we know the creator could be a group of government officials or one person who made btc a hobby project...

He said this on CNBC, I agree to most of it. Basically saying it is a non-productive asset, something that doesn't produce anything in return but is just what is without giving a return. Trading it just manufactures it to be more valued because you think the next guy wants to buy the same thing at a higher price. [Warren Buffett: Bitcoin Is An Asset That Creates Nothing | CNBC](

First Buffet has always been against investing in gold, he is well known as being against it. He said that he doesn't invest in non-productive assets like he and you said, so you clearly have no idea what you are on about. 
A couple of quotes that you can easily find by typing buffet and gold into google; "Warren Buffett has been very vocal about his disdain for gold as an investment. He sees little to no value in gold. What Buffett refers to as a lack of value results from a lack of usefulness. He once stated about gold, "It doesn't do anything but sit there and look at you." . [1](
. "Gold gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head." [2]( Besides, gold atleast has more use as it been implemented in many areas.  
"What's so ~~**so**~~ funny about your response" is that it is canceled out by your own lack of knowledge and contradiction on the obvious you pointed out. He does not like non-productive assets like Bitcoin and Gold, so you just made some backward ass logic to sound smart. Well no actually it makes sense. The majority of the BTC community HATES bankers, market makers, NASDAQ, CME, government reg, Jamie Dimon and Buffet because they are the part of the "system" unless they turn bullish which spikes the price so they are given a 180 flip overnight...

He makes money, he has invested in tech companies and sold all. Silver is used in real world situation, doesn't mean he is a investor, just like a pump and dump on shit coins. My reply referenced buffets well known thoughts on gold which you obviously researched. He isn't a old fool, he has people working for him looking at the shortings but he has the say.

Lol as a designer this is hilarious. The OP doesn't want feedback, doesn't understand the user base bias and has decided this is the "New Bitcoin Logo" for something that is known for being against ownership. 100 level troll.  
@_date: 2018-06-21 06:56:04
Weird with different meanings bitcoin + connect, bitconnect?. Logo is ripping away from a screaming Bear, as like the bearish market atm? I reckon excluding the logo all the things were meant to be there but some design choice by a edgy kid convinced the others to put the logo....

Is it advertising Bitcoin or Maicoin? Looks to be using Bitcoin as a way to say Maicoin is the same

With the above examples you list what benefit does Bitcoin have to deserve to exist and be in higher regard to them? Just curious on the response

I get that it was the initial purpose. The ideology meant to help the impoverished around the world and free you from the banks. If so many people hoarding and holding them from way back and now traders in the markets can have a huge stockpile, I see it just as stock with no CEO. It can be heavily manipulated. I am not in US and I see it jump once the markets open. With that no one is going to be able to be helped in countries with government corruption if everyone thinks it will reach 30-100k for each coin.

I am not questioning the smart-contract. Only bitcoins purpose. You think banks can't mess with it, they already are. Not through the tech but by trading it at huge volumes. No regulation and it is 24/7. There are 30 if not more fiat markets around the world pumping and dumping with no loyalty to bitcoin. Even large companies with the stock market have set up million dollar mining farms to take part.
"On-chain transactions are like handling physical gold, second layer solutions like LN are like currency"
So if I held 1BTC in the year 2022 with a value of 80,000 why would I buy or part anything with it, with a limited amount and 7billion+ people it will never be seen as money. Going back to the OP, I have family in countries with corrupt banks and governments, they wouldn't know or afford to buy bitcoin at all.

Please give me stores, travel agents accepting bitcoin I can buy with no fiat swap not just assumptions that we must have places. I googled BTC gift cards the first link in Australia is a online store of NON-BTC cards being bought using BTC. So I have to buy BTC from a exchange (again that 8 billion circle) use that BTC to buy a store gift card and I can use the gift card in store with no need to touch BTC in store... The online store would then I assume sell the BTC I gave them for fiat at a exchange.... 
Hypothetically if apple peel stickers are considered as valuable you could replace BTC in the scenario with stickers. Same thing. Also the final checkout purchase came to $16 for a gift card using BTC, the gift card was $10.

For what though? 8 billion from exchanges and traders. I would like to buy a something in a store like Amazon or Kmart.
