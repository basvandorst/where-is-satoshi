Finally I managed to get a fucking reply out of you. If it wasn't you, why did two seperate people, as well as myself independently come to the conclusion it was most likely you who took my coin? I'm sure you'd be relatively pissed off if you'd just had 22 coins stolen as well.

Well I can only apologise for my accusations, but when two very trusted friends of mine with extensive knowledge of computers come up with the same result and suspected thief, I'm pretty willing to believe them. 
I guess I'll just have to count it as a loss :/

Unless this is done automatically by btc-qt I didn't. Basically I knew I was going to be buying a large amount of BTC and so encrypted my wallet before buying.

Windows. And I'm running Java. I guess that's how they got taken. Police aren't going to have much luck finding them are they?

I've phoned the police and they have passed it onto their cyber crime unit. Here's hoping I can get them back

I got help from a more tech-savvi person than myself and they've come to the same conclusion. Any idea where to go with it now? Send him a message? Report him to the feds? This is beyond my technical know-how.

Sorry I wasn't sure what information to include.
After my coins were taken I did a full scan using malwarebytes anti-malware and it revealed a trojan and a backdoor. I had only encrypted my wallet a few hours before sending the coins from localbitcoins &gt; bitcoinqt. I assume he had some kind of keylogger built into one of the two virus's.
The forum profile is on bitcointalk.org, not sure if I'm allowed to link to his profile or not so I'll leave that out for now.
