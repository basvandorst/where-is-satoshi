What is most revealing to me is the company is from London.

Please actually send back! You guys have been unresponsive for a week!
@_date: 2016-05-12 15:21:34
From my perspective its lost. Don't you see??
@_date: 2016-05-12 15:19:30
Still unresponsive. I do not recommend anyone invest into the crowdsale at this point.

Also Bitcoin Wireless is looking very interesting, perfect idea.

Yes it's from coinbase. Excellent quality cotton too.

My take is that Google will incorporate Bitcoin (and eventually altcoins) into their web services like Wallet if people continue to demand their Bitcoins. Google has been decent at figuring out what the people want and like to use, so I don't think they are afraid to accommodate digital currency users. If anything they would like to corner the market early. Paypal can't even complete with person to person payment tech like this. Only Bitcoin can. 
Remember Google is attempting to take over the world. They will probably purchase Ripple. They would relish with everybody's digital money sitting on their servers.

But we can comment about what impact this development may have on Bitcoin.

I met a nice lady from that company and made a quick cash deal at a discount (all the sellers wanted btc firstly, usd as an alt haha). 
The event was essentially an operating sentient little city. A beautiful microcosm of what bitcoin can be on the large scale. Or, maybe a history replica of wampum being between native americans and colonists. 
I bought the RUN BTC shirt with cash. A shot glass with cash (out of photo). Bitcoin mag with btc and the binary logo tee in the top left with btc from this smoking hot vendor chick. Fair prices too. 
Idk if anyone here saw the girl I'm talking about that was about the BIPS booth. She was from FL and from an apparel backround, I talked with her a bit. She was my first.. bitcoin transaction that is!

The people I met all around the world, of course. The other goal is to network with potential business mates. Making a real world connection to all this virtual stuff is healthy for us web junkies. Some of the speakers such as Gavin Andersen and Eric Voorhees, wow geniuses, man.

meetup.com! search your area for bitcoin people that wanna talk!

(83% like it) 17% jelly

Yes, however its still buggy as heck. The lamassus machine was much more of a market ready product. Great UI, fun to use and cheap enough for a convenience store owner to buy. From a legal standpoint with Bitcoin you only want to be transacting in one direction. The buy direction.

I have seen all of these topics for a few weeks now. You and I must be very similar speculators. Were you just at the conference?
@_date: 2013-05-23 07:07:52
Charlie? Winklevoss twin? Bitinstant model perhaps? :D 
On twitter I'm  follow me back! I just got back into twitter to stay connected with that side of the scene.
