That’s like 900% gains. Even the stock market has an annual average of 7-8%. This year’s market is 15-16% and 20+% since last year’s election. Is 900% gains not enough?

I've never purchased one before but I always smoke my friend's when I'm hanging out with him. Can you help me with what parts I need to buy?

Not sure if this goes here or but what gives a coin its value? 
For Bitcoins, I've always figured value is determined based on the market. This includes the feasibility of using Bitcoins in the real world, finding businesses that accept Bitcoins, the rarity of aspect of Bitcoins based on supply and mining difficulty. 
For all of these other coins, they should theoretically retain no value as hardly any businesses accept them. Yet they're still worth cents and dollars in the market.

Is it possible to notice a computer running a web browser miner? Like bitcoinplus for example.

Once that bitcoin credit card comes out, that might help boost up the subliminal message?

it all makes sense now...

I'm not sure how legit this is but I just created a new "receive" address and signed up to play. I got 0.00000443 BTC my first roll. 
Anyone know anything more about this site?
Edit: I guess it's also a gambling site for BTC
Edit2: I wonder if you can create lots of accounts with different receiving addresses and get free bitcoins every hour. Maybe run a program/script to do that... hmm

Vietnam...is that how they really work? They just print money to print money? I remember in 2005, $1 USD would get about 15,800 Dong. Now $1 gets about 20,000+ Dong so there's definitely some lowering of value.

For some reason I'm hearing a double entendre of "buy buy buy" and "bye bye bye" Bitcoin. Both up and down.

There are 7 billion people in the world and Bitcoin will never exceed 21 million in supply. If everyone had an equal amount, did the creator expect us to have less than 1 BTC?
@_date: 2014-07-03 16:17:05

That won't be for another ~~20~~ 120 years or so. Mining gets exponential harder

Why wouldn't you just use local time if you're within geographic proximity?
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:27:12
That's so confusing. 
I think the better thing to do is to use local time. For example, on r/tennis, when we're talking about the US Open, we'll say "so and so's match starts at 7pm ET" because the US Open takes place in New York. 
When we discuss the Australian Open, that just happened recently, everything is in Melbourne time. Luckily, the AO page has conversions right at the top of the corner.
