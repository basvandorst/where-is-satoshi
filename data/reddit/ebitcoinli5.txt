I think about this a lot. Why are we all sheep? I think we’ve become comfortable and since things have been comfortable for us we think the gov is doing everything it can to protect us and that’s why we’re feeling comfortable. What we don’t realize is powers are just balanced enough for us to feel comfortable and it’s not because of the gov. They’ve convinced us that regulating things make them work. Regulation isn’t bad, but it’s not what MAKES something work. Anyways, we’re convinced that the government has our best interest overall so why question it and the barrier to participate in bitcoin without KYC is way too high for a speculative tech like this.

Yep, I hear on ya the communities. I think we have too much noise from so much media selling us on what to believe and do. We’re overwhelmed with that but can’t escape it to listen to ourselves a bit more. We lose sight of what’s actually important to us as individuals because we’re caught in the cycle that constantly tells us what’s important to us. No time to think these days.

ELI5 why it’s going to $0?
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:51:45
Lightning fast
@_date: 2019-11-26 02:13:18
Well shit.
@_date: 2019-11-25 03:13:01
Aren’t they somehow more traceable?
@_date: 2019-11-25 14:52:51
Can you share the steps to have a good UTxO hygiene? And also ELI5 what UTxO is?
@_date: 2019-11-28 20:26:03
This is great!

@_date: 2019-11-25 00:26:48
Is there any known techs that look promising? I ask this assuming no altcoins as we know them will displace bitcoin so asking specifically about other types of tech. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:30:59
Just hodl the dip
@_date: 2019-11-26 14:50:14
ELI5 why would anyone accept BCH over BTC?
@_date: 2019-11-30 02:53:23
$30 s/h
@_date: 2019-11-23 21:10:34
ELI5... What’s it mean to “batch” transactions?
@_date: 2019-11-24 22:50:54
Have you tried others? It seemed less intuitive than others so I didn’t spend much time with it. Should I? What do you like about it?
@_date: 2019-11-23 21:40:50
Are fees the biggest reasons to not use Coinbase and a Gemini?
@_date: 2019-11-24 08:37:32
Why did he leave?
@_date: 2019-11-26 05:43:21
ELI5 trading volume is just market activity right? Actual blockchain usage... spending... etc don’t impact the price, right?
@_date: 2019-11-26 07:19:17
Plot twist: he before-and-aftered it and really meant Ontario, California.
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:35:55
Thanks mike hunt
@_date: 2019-11-25 20:29:18
and follow-up bonus question... what makes mixers risky? I will read up on them just want to know what to be aware of I guess. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-11-28 19:59:34
Whaaa? What do you do in that situation? Can you get the coins back?
@_date: 2019-11-24 19:42:07
True true

PlanB says 100k in 2 years? That’s S/F?

Ohhh boomer ��
@_date: 2019-11-25 03:22:47
Makes sense, ty
@_date: 2019-11-25 02:26:04
How far away are we from that from a tech standpoint? What needs to be done for that to happen?
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:22:58
Interesting analogy. What/who governs the names coins use?
@_date: 2019-11-26 00:42:43
How do you know when it’s “known to belong to you?” Lol sounds like a joke but seriously... just after anytime u acquire them thru a KYC exchange? Are there other transaction types to be aware of in that regard that aren’t as obvious?
@_date: 2019-11-26 05:36:21
ELI5 what are inputs here? Number of addresses that equaled the total sent?
@_date: 2019-11-26 08:07:57
I’m not trying to imply anything by success. Product market fit? Adoption? I dunno... whatever the FUD is saying can’t happen.
@_date: 2019-11-28 09:33:07
@_date: 2019-11-24 08:35:00
What exactly is segwit? App? Protocol? Is there an analogy to anything? Trying to wrap my head around it...
@_date: 2019-11-25 20:27:20
Thank you... what is the significance of  Shouldn't use the same address? Why not? Is that a tech thing or a security thing?
@_date: 2019-11-24 18:36:12
Have seen this sentiment a few times. I’m more interested in the value of the tech vs the price, but why will it drop in a week? Something fundamental?
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:10:15
Just saw the comments about reposting. What are you trying to get from reposting? Do you need help publishing or just letting everyone know you’re thinking about doing something?
If the former, ask for help. If the latter, stop and just do it!
Yes you should do it. Go do it. You’ll be happy you did.
@_date: 2019-11-29 23:31:00
Eh, this was the plan all along. Whoever is her successor is has been a part of the plan the whole time.
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:37:37
How do we best prepare for that outside of investing in it?

If one communist country is home to most of the hash power, can they control its destiny?

I hear you.... I think the culmination of all that synchronized use of GNU + governance tho is in and of itself a new technological feat. Nawimsayinnn
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:40:51
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:23:29
You’re right... it’s actually a simile as I’m drawing a comparison using the word “like”
@_date: 2019-11-23 22:02:41
What’s the use case? Or is it just mainly the cost savings?
@_date: 2019-11-30 02:30:45
That’s like mustard for me. Ahhh sooo many types!
@_date: 2019-11-26 05:44:42
@_date: 2019-11-25 02:29:28
You really think so?
@_date: 2019-11-28 07:20:00
Blockfi’s customers are the same institutions that backed them. Peter Thiel is an investor. Does that mean he’s essentially shorting bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-25 02:32:05
Can u please ELI5?
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:15:24
Aah, ty
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:29:18
Just tend to look at things thru a macro lens. Don’t mean to imply anything by the time
@_date: 2019-11-26 05:54:54

I think I like trace but it seems like he can be pretty vain... drinking outta that gold cup and all lol
@_date: 2019-11-29 01:00:14
vectors scale without losing quality. It’s efficient.
@_date: 2019-11-24 22:47:34
ELI5: what’s this mean for the n00b just leaning about bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-29 00:38:24
@_date: 2019-11-24 19:46:01
What are the bounds of the eyelet of that needle?

Purchased. Thank you
@_date: 2019-11-23 21:30:45
What was s2x? Sewgit? Is segwit bad for bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-24 18:30:04
Would you be willing to ELI5? Several channels on one node? Are those just connections other parties make when routing thru a node?
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:53:39
If it weren’t for them we wouldn’t have created bitcoin, so I mean we kinda owe them edit: /s
@_date: 2019-11-25 20:30:13
How does one mitigate the tracking and surveillance that Coinbase does? Just by using a mixer and Electrum?
@_date: 2019-11-24 21:10:34
Wow, thank you! That is SO much clearer to me now
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:45:34
No analogies tho!

Lol TRUTH. Any data on where those pockets of merchants are? Don’t see many in the US... yet
@_date: 2019-12-05 06:21:26
Do u think they’re anticipating it?
@_date: 2019-12-17 06:08:30
Sure, but people don’t have to bet the farm. They don’t even have to invest money they can just start by reading about it. My point is more that we’re too lazy to want to even entertain a conversation about it and instead just assume we missed the boat and be ok with it
@_date: 2019-12-30 04:17:41
No ledger?
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:57:19
I’ve seen this before too... do u know the thought behind it?
@_date: 2019-12-16 07:00:05
Yeah it seems like they’re pretty great. They look dope too. The mixing bowl idea is interesting... different kinda trust involved there lol that’d suck to put .1 in and grab on with zilch on it. I’m sure there are easy incentives to prevent that but first thing I thought of.
What if whole communities came together and shuffled em all up. Kinda cool
@_date: 2019-12-26 01:27:44
ELI5 where’s the joke?
@_date: 2019-12-05 03:00:37
Where is better?

ELI5 the significance of this?
@_date: 2019-12-27 16:01:57
Book of crossword puzzles or word finds

@_date: 2019-12-10 01:56:53
ELI5 what is Reddit?
@_date: 2019-12-16 05:35:26
One day it’ll click for you too
@_date: 2019-12-30 05:20:55
Awesome to hear his focus on product. This industry needs that... I’m new to bitcoin and this is the first I’ve heard much talk at all about product or ux. I think bitcoin adoption will grow from network effects alone but improving the user’s experience will def speed it up
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:23:29
Is there data on the merchant metric?
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:24:57
You’re right.
@_date: 2019-12-23 01:55:29
Spend it
@_date: 2019-12-09 02:29:35
You mean Doge?
@_date: 2019-12-17 03:37:30
Ha was thinking the same thing. Why do they keep talking themselves out of it. It seems pathological...
@_date: 2019-12-17 06:11:22
Bought at 20k only to see it drop to 16k. Gulp
@_date: 2019-12-09 02:58:02
Thanks! Does that centralization of network capacity create an risks? Guessing just maybe higher fees?
@_date: 2019-12-18 06:55:11
@_date: 2019-12-03 04:32:59
Thanks... Kinda interesting there isn’t one. Maybe the infrastructure isn’t there yet but it’d be a great marketing campaign... spread awareness plus provide enough incentive to overcome the current barriers to buy bitcoin by offering awesome deals to buy with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:48:52
Makes me think tho... digital currency should be more easily adopted in the digital world vs physical one. So guessing most merchants are just online at the moment, eh?
