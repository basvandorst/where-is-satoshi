Bitcoin is an immutable, untamperable ledger. It solves real problems that ALL forms of money- including gold- have always had. Solutions to problems are worth value. 
If you think central banks aren't corrupt to the core then there's no hope for you.

lol you sir are a buffoon who has no clue about money. For starters I highly recommend you learn the difference between price and value.
First of all, the dollar is subject to inflation because it's backed by nothing. The government can at any time print more of it and devalue the currency.
Bitcoin is not subject to devaluation. It is immutable and untamperable. There are real solutions to real world problems solved by bitcoin and the blockchain and solutions to large problems have serious value.
Your rental homes don't increase in value- they simple increase in price relative to the dollar because the dollar becomes more and more worthless. It's incredible you can cite price fluctuations in real estate while being oblivious to price fluctuations in bitcoin. 
Do yourself a favor and educate yourself- Learn about the Ecu de Marc and why kings and noblemen would prefer it over currency and even gold. Bitcoin is nothing but a digital version of it with years of cryptographic and technological innovation from some of the greatest minds enabling it to operate on a TRUSTLESS, DECENTRALIZED network.

I'm just telling you the truth. Look how many upvotes my comment has. 
You have what's known as "survivorship bias". It is skewing your perception to the point where you not only believe that you earned your money through your own skillset, but that your system is so effective you can teach it to others and they will be successful too. To be blunt: you are delusional.
Maybe you genuinely want to help others for free. The intention is great- but it's based on delusion and is dangerous to the people you throw your pitch at. Why? Because you aren't successful for the reasons you believe. And others who listen to you will lose money.
Consider this: why are there so many 'professional traders' selling their courses and charging money to receive their "signals" when they could just make money trading instead? If their system were so amazing they would be multi billionaires and have no reason to sell trading courses. This is common sense isn't it?
Anyone can "trade" and make money in a bull market like we've seen these past few years. In a true bear market you would get rekt. In fact, just buying a few coins and doing NOTHING ELSE would have yeilded exponentially more profits than "trading". 1,000 dollars in ETH ICO would yield you 4 million today.
You traded shit back and forth while the entire market was going up exponentially. Of course sooner or later you're bound to make profit. The irony is that just doing nothing probably would have made you more money.

The value of bitcoin is 1 bitcoin. Basic economics should tell you that the price relative to the dollar will never fall below the cost of electricity it takes to mine 1 BTC.
Land is obviously always going to be valuable, but saying the value of bitcoin "only exists in your head" is just silly. Bitcoin solves many HUGE problems that have plagued ALL currency since the dawn of man. You probably never will understand this because your narrow minded outlook prevents you from doing any real research or learning about the innovations bitcoin has brought to economics.
Food is perishable. Water can evaporate. Land can be seized. How are you going to transfer value over large distances with any of them? Are you going to dig up your land and carry it your back for 1000 miles and sell it to to someone? Do you understand what currency IS? Who will trust your currency? Who will ensure it's not been devalued? What will keep a central authority from simply printing more of it?
You really have to stop naysaying and do some actual research about bitcoin because you have no idea what it is or how it works or what problems it solves.

Many alt coins are being made precisely to make transactions more efficient. They all work in conjunction with bitcoin. Of course people would buy bitcoin with alt coins- bitcoin stores value a lot better than alt coins.
According to your logic, the value of gold would "collapse" because it's not a good currency. According to you, the dollar doesn't need gold to function- and no one would ever purchase gold with dollars. It's just poor analytical thinking on your part.

Since the communist party took over China, a very bad reputation has been built up for products and services originating there. The corruption is out of this world.
Pets have died from arsenic poisoning in their pet food made in China. PVC pipes are lined with lead and poison people unknowingly for years. Toys for toddlers and young children are full of neuro-toxins. Curtains, carpets and sofas arent treated with flame retardants and people regularly burn to death. And why? Because some corrupt business man/regulator/politician in China makes a few million dollars.
Be glad there are only memes made about your country. 
Let me make it clear that I hold the pre-communist Chinese culture in the highest esteem- but NOT the corrupt Orwellian nightmare it has become politically and commercially thanks to Mao Zedong, the devil himself.
If you want to change your reputation, you're going to have to rally together and overthrow your corrupt government.

You completely missed my points. The alt coins will in fact minimize transaction fees- that's why they exist. It might require an absolute minimum amount of transactions using bitcoin to get those altcoins if your store of value happens to be in bitcoin. Your original argument was that no one could possibly sell bitcoin to anyone and I showed you why you were mistaken.
"There are no fees involved if you buy and sell goods with gold."
This is inherently false. There absolutely is a fee acquiring and depositing gold, keeping it safe, carrying it around. The overwhelming majority of interactions are made using fiat currency precisely because gold is cumbersome as a medium of exchange. This is why I explained to you how gold would still convey its value even if fiat is used in most transactions- it has a direct correlation to the bitcoin/altcoin relationship.
Gold has no more inherent value than bitcoin does. It's a piece of metal. How does it keep you alive? A loaf of bread is infinitely more valueable in a true end of the world scenario than a lump of metal. This fallacious argument has been used ad nauseum and it's so simple to rebute. Bitcoin can't be duplicated. It's decentralized. It's immune to inflation. It's anonymous. All these add to it's value. To believe the price of bitcoin is high only because of speculation is silly. It's price is high because it has value to many people.

Make sure with any exchange you first send a small amount to and from your wallets. This insures security on the blockchain.
Once it goes through, send larger amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:08:46
Like I said; it's a value store. Your argument was that bitcoin is impractical as a currency and therefore "people buying it" is the only thing keeping it alive. Which is fallacious. Many alt coins are being made precisely to make transactions more efficient. They all work in conjunction with bitcoin. Of course people would buy bitcoin with alt coins- bitcoin stores value a lot better than alt coins.
According to your logic, the value of gold would "collapse" because it's not a good currency. According to you, the dollar doesn't need gold to function- and no one would ever purchase gold with dollars. It's just poor analytical thinking on your part.

I'd practice trading a bit with 10%, make sure I don't make any mistakes.
Then 30%-50%, and partially cash out during the highs to get back your investment. Then buy back in during dips.

So I'm assuming this is because splitting your stack up into smaller parts gives you more "room" for a series of losses so that you are less affected exponentially by losses and benefit consistently over the long run from gains? It sounds almost paradoxical that smaller bet sizes can yield better returns, but it seems true by experience. For instance if I lose 30 % my entire portfolio then the gains, although big, are so significantly less than what would be needed to recooperate that loss. Whereas if I only lost 30% of 25% of my stack then each position size is only reduced by 1.75% and wins still give a decent return. Perhaps one needs more frequent bets though? or is it okay to have your other positions sitting on the sidelines?

"I thought they are weird people because I was fine using CEX.IO.I never thought this kind of SCAM would happen to me."
Hate to say this, but you got what you deserved. Nothing is more annoying than the guy who comes in saying "I haven't had any issues with them" after someone reports a scam. You heard about and knew they were a scam but chose to judge others instead of heed their warning.
I still upvoted you to bring attention to others though.

What's up everyone. Coming back to report on my findings for anyone who visits this old thread. 
Unfortunately there are no truly elegant answers or low fee gateways. Cex.IO and Changelly are reported to have scammed money from people, and I've also heard shady things about Uphold. All of them charge 10-15% fees. I've also read Kraken doesn't service Hawaii residents.
Don't waste time trying out any of these new wallets or exchanges because none of them will accept Hawaii residents. Some of the shady ones like Abra will keep your personal info and never tell you why you were denied service.
A potential solution is signing up a business account created in another state with GDAX, and linking a bank from the mainland. But businesses need to file tax quarterly so good luck with the extra BS. Also- trying a Nevada LLC to avoid capital gains tax might put you on IRS radar. 
The one solution I've found for cashing out bitcoin into fiat after literally months of searching is a virtual currency exchange called VirWox, and they are able to get around many regulation laws because they do not use direct BTC/usd pairing. Instead you buy their virtual currency and exchange it with BTC and vice versa. The fees are still high though. 3.9% commission on each trade which is a bare minimum of 7.8% when cashing out (once to convert btc into their token, again to convert that into cash). You then have to pay a third fee if using PayPal to get it into your bank account.
Again it's not elegant but at least it's an option without having to meet up with someone personally and risking jail time for being a "currency exchange" by selling BTC (smh). 
Good luck.

That wasn't his premise. That's your interpretation of what his premise was, which is clearly mistaken.
This is his actual premise: 


First of all there are sophisticated searching algorithms, so he's wrong to begin with. And addressing even your misinterpretation of his premise- I already succinctly disproved you by demonstrating that the "noise" a.k.a. "mass amounts of shit" in public opinion is valueable data which is closely monitored, rigorously filtered and even searchable as well. Whether you disagree with those opinions or not is irrelevant. They are worth serious money. They lead to market innovation and social trends. It is not the random cacophony you make it out to be.

It was Nick Szabo for sure. Nakamoto, Satoshi = N.S. = Nick Szabo. He created BitGold and practically wrote the white paper for bitcoin years before it was released. He even had a Freudian slip on a Tim Feriss interview where he said "when I created bitcoin". He needed help with cryptography and went to Hal and the cypher punks for help, using Hals neighbor Satoshi as a pseudonym.

Nope, that's just your assumption. You need to do more research. Nick was a brilliant computer scientist and even created bitgold decades before bitcoin but needed help with cryptography and went to the cypherpunks for assistance, working first with Hal Finney. He practically wrote a whitepaper for bitcoin in the 80's.

But he said that in response to the comment above which said "it's at 7800 *now*". So the statement is true that it's "not at the 3k many said it would be" since it's referring to the present moment. He didn't say that it would never reach that price- only that it's not currently at that price now. 
Let's say a weight lifter is supposed to hit a 500 pound bench press by next year. He gets into an accident and people are doubtful he will ever lift weights again. But he recovers and starts benching again. Someone says "he's still on for his goal of 500". Another person says "yeah but it's only at 150 now..". Third guy says "and not the 0 many said it would be".
That is essentially the context of the statements leading up to your joining the convo.

So, basically, here's my deconstruction of your exchange:
There price definitely *could* do anything- as there is always a probability of a scenario where it might happen. So you are technically correct and were reminding people it DEFINITELY is a possibility. But it should also be pointed out that he did not specifically state that the price was NEVER going to hit 3k (which would exclude that possibility entirely).
Also- In common vernacular we already take into account that there is always a *possibility* for anything. Therefore, he could only infer from your use of the term *definitely* to imply *strength* in the probability, and structured his argument around that.
So to be fair I believe this is an issue of you projecting a prior argument with others who said the price could NEVER reach 3000 and are actually the one who miscomprehended his statement, despite you being technically correct in your statement. Make sense?
Maybe can chime in on my evaluation :p
