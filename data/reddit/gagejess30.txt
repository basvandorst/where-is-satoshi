It will rise again to the nth time in my prediction. Many investors are getting involved. It will also go down for sure but both rise and down we don't know exactly when. I am still on the buying side and trading for months now with Paxful. I enjoyed my first 5% harvest as of this moment and waiting for the second time to withdraw another 5% of my profit. Still waiting the right time.

1. Where is the best place to trade Bitcoin? I did set up an account with Coinbase, but is that really the best place? I also looked at GDAX, which seems terribly tough to understand and work with, and is very intimidating.
Paxful is one of the best to trade your bitcoins. They also accept GCs in exchange of a bitcoin and vice versa. They use escrow and have 24/7 support which is safe.
2. Where/How can I transfer my Bitcoins to a secure wallet? Can I do all of this on mobile?
Yes you can.
3. Is there a guide or something that answers all these questions (other than google of course)?
Yes. search for Paxful channel on YT. There are tons of video tutorials there.
4. Can I get 5$ worth of Bitcoin, or do I need to buy 1 Bitcoin worth of USD?
Better register at Paxful website. Lots of different vendors offers a good rates.
