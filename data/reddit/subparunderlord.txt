Ahh okay read your last post regarding your company, see I think you have a possibility of it working I think if people are really gonna save a bunch right away it may encourage them to buy just to pay for you. Personally my dad who does  a fair bit of investing in  traditional fiat forms, says he has no desire to invest in bitcoin as he doesn't understand it and doesn't understand how it can defy more conventional fiat based investments, however if he was to save several hundred dollars or a good fraction of the purchase price I can see him and others like him investing the time to purchase the bitcoin needed to pay you in order to save money. However there are drawbacks right now as it's not insanely simple to just purchase bitcoin, as bitcoin becomes easier to purchase which it has and probably will continue to, more people will be apt to put in the bit of time required to buy cryptocurrencies, as well as the demographics of the working class and home owners becomes more modern and more tech savvy I think you will definitely see an influx of people who are willing to buy bitcoin just to save a some money at the time and have no interest investing in bitcoin itself. For now though I think the amount of people who will be willing to spend bitcoin for products are services will be limited to those who, understand and want cryptocurrencies to become viable and don't mind loosing some money in the long term, or people who are really just looking to save some cash right away if their is a discount offered, as they are either a) cheap or b) tight for cash. I'd like to state I'm not an expert when it comes to crypto currencies heck I've only just recently started looking at crypto investment options and was introduced to bitcoin as a form of payment for a dark market product however I think my limited knowledge and not being super investment provides a different perspective and one that probably more accurately represents the general population. Hope this helps maybe?¿

Just scroll down the sub Reddit a bit and you will see plenty of different examples of non dark or in other terms legal businesses accepting crypto currencies. It's slowly catching on just will take time before more businesses make the switch.
