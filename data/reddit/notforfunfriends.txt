My point is, it doesn’t mean people are actually using the app. Sure there is a demand for exchanges and apps associated with cryptocurrency but are people actually using them and do they understand what the currencies are for/how they are different from one another?  
I’m bullish on BTC and other coins but it is too hard and confusing for the average person to get involved at this point. That coupled with possibilities for hacking, differences in exchange rates and other infrastructural/governance issues annoy me. 
The tech is super interesting and I look forward to learning more about it. I also want to see more use cases for the currencies if we want to prove adoption and value.

Did I miss my chance to buy as low as I could have?

I think Square has the chance of creating a super easy interface for laymen to participate in BTC and all. Look into what they are doing. They may have higher fees akin to Visa but it’s a simple interface and they can develop relationships with merchants, provide cards that can be used at vendors/accept BTC and alt coins and maybe absorb fraud charges all the while using lightning to power it all.

I know but again my point is people lose faith and distrust the idea if these things happen esp the average person or newbie. Plus, it’s still bad that wallets are centralized like the industry as a whole. Is it truly decentralized yet? I don’t think so. Still needs work.

I understand but the process of protecting your assets is hard and other concepts within crypto. 
Also, if you have a CB Wallet overseas it’s extremely limiting. You can’t buy or sell anything and if you use other wallets they don’t offer buying and selling of other coins at all. They only offer BTC, ETH and maybe one other one. 
The wallets themselves are centralized. Look at how much control they have over customer accounts. You can’t even get into your account to check your balance sometimes, get your ID verified let alone put in orders for buys/sells and they have limits on the exchange. No one knows what’s going on.

Ahhhhhhh. I hope we win.

Yeah but do we have to go to war? ��

Sage advice. ����

Ahh yes did read that and did see that people want the ability to short too. Keep in mind unfortunately we may be going to war with NK. That will pump BTC.

I agree. I wish I knew when they are gonna regulate.

Oh how I loathe Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:15:28
Are you all using Coinbase to buy?
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:26:12
You using Coinbase or gdax?

I wonder if all of the pipelined transactions from the last few days have settled by now.  I guess I'll use Coinbase or Kraken. Thank you
