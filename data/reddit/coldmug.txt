Thank you! Just making sure everyone knows how to tackle this kind of issue. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 15:56:53
Yes. What is a bank run?
You don't even have a reasonable expectation to your funds actually being in the bank's holdings. Banks lend out money. Including your money. That's their whole business model.

If you traded over a website like LocalBitcoins there might be some hope. Here's my recent scam reversal issue that I managed to win 
@_date: 2014-12-05 13:19:47
OMFG!!! Bitcoin isn't anonymous? My transactions are all logged? WTF! Thanks Forbes!
@_date: 2014-05-21 06:35:54
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:16:39
At least they didn't arrest you for not answering your phone.
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:46:39
Paypal basically has a monopoly on payment processing online, at least for small size merchants who can't or don't want to keep a bank account. This is why it gets away with insane fees and things like buyer chargebacks. If there were other options Paypal wouldn't be able to do the things it does now, because merchants would go elsewhere. This is why Paypal is so scared of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-21 08:51:40
I suppose. But what would you propose be the option in this kind of situation? 
@_date: 2014-05-21 11:43:16
Yeah, thats why I mentioned that Paypal is still very risky. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 08:14:47
Not exactly. I opened a "fraud" case in their support section. They had already received negative indications from other users about this particular user. Since they could not return my bitcoins the only thing they could do was help me with my paypal case. And since the user account is already marked as fraud, and has been under scrutiny for a while, I don't think they did anything wrong. If you're clearly doing something wrong, you're logs should be available for investigation.
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:43:24
I'm sorry to hear that hihat7. A couple days ago, one of the two transactions reversed again, and this time Paypal closed our account. Thankfully, I didn't really have any money in there. Just have to learn to move on from Paypal, I guess.
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:36:57
Great find.


@_date: 2014-05-22 01:33:35
This is the first time I'm hearing Paypal can reverse its decision. I hope it doesn't. But its ridiculous if it can. 
Hopefully by that time I'll be independent of Paypal. Bad to hear about you getting scammed though. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 05:21:04
Thank you. I have reposted an edited version.
@_date: 2014-05-21 11:42:33
Interestingly enough, the IP addresses were mostly from one place. But sometimes he would apparently log in from half way across the US. Maybe that stood out as an anomaly, IDK.
@_date: 2014-05-22 02:11:52
Perhaps Peter's been reading Jeff Tucker? 
@_date: 2014-05-21 01:36:13
Its the only option I have right now. My wife lives in the US and I'm in Singapore. Paypal eats up nearly 5-6% of every transaction (not including conversion fees). Bitcoin into Paypal is the only sane way for doing it. We're trying to get a bank account and then just use coinbase to withdraw funds, but thats a while away.
@_date: 2014-05-21 05:20:38
It acts like it. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:35:07
People usually do offer premiums on Paypal sales because of the risks involved. I've sold before to (genuine) traders who offered high premiums. His ads are still online, but his account is basically disabled. Or at least thats what Localbitcoins told me.
@_date: 2014-05-21 11:40:58
Like I said before, it wasn't willy nilly. I opened a fraud case, which they investigated on their end and concluded that it was fraud. That's why they gave me the info to support my claim against Paypal.
@_date: 2014-12-05 13:27:19
You can't just assume that. No third party is completely trustable. That assumption doesn't hold in the real world. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:35:25
This! I would love something like this. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:32:33
It's not a "whim". They were already investigating this user. They received more than one complaint about him. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 03:16:47
Can I still keep the bitcoin addresses on there? The information is there only to warn other people against this scam address. How is that handled usually?
Would you mind if I edited it instead?
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:14:54
This! Not to mention all the issues you have with cards.


@_date: 2014-05-22 09:30:50
My point is it's not just "anyone's" information and they don't just give it out to "anyone". There's a specific case, and it's present in their privacy policy as another commented pointed out. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 08:35:04
True. Looks like the scammer wasn't very bright. I did get lucky. That's why I said its still not a safe way to trade.
@_date: 2014-05-21 01:35:11
Yes that is true. He does sound like not a very bright scammer, especially seeing as the bitcoins remain in those addresses.
@_date: 2014-05-21 11:42:50
This is what I'm hoping, but its a very optimistic view.
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:35:59
No I opened a fraud case at localbitcoins. Not paypal
@_date: 2014-05-21 11:44:02
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:56:33
Forget bank. I save you money. You give me $1 a month only. Low low price, only for you!
@_date: 2014-05-21 03:48:34
They deleted it because of policy against personal info.
@_date: 2016-12-22 09:33:57
It's great that you have someone supply you Chinese. I usually have to call the takeaways
@_date: 2016-09-16 08:34:28
And you know the best part? 
Not a single cent went to any government.
@_date: 2016-05-10 08:59:28
It's not important what these economists know. What's important is that they have Nobel prizes and NYTimes best-seller books.

@_date: 2015-02-19 07:50:37
I have an account in Singapore. And there's exchanges here too. So I could technically still use my account here. Thanks for the link to transferwise, it could be useful.
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:12:10
Yeah LOL. I kinda figured I'd be working in other currencies anyway. Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2015-02-19 06:20:15
Duly noted. I wasn't much impressed with Lloyds the last time I was in the UK either.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:24:36
The chances of losing 10 times in a row are the exact same as losing once. It's called the gambler's fallacy, and it stems from a misunderstanding of probability.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:57:47
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:40:03
Looks like its been happening a lot
@_date: 2015-02-19 07:50:52
Haha. Just like every other bank on the planet.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:49:39
Look guys I know what's happening. Apple is planning to revolutionize digital currency as we speak. They're secretly developing a digital crypto currency which makes it super easy to pay for goods and services. The transfer fees for the new currency will be 25% for purchases 5$ or more, 5$ for minor purchases. The qr codes will be little dots made of Steve jobs pics. And you'll need to scan your fingerprint every time you use it to send or receive so that NSA can keep tabs on you all the time. It's coming out early next year! That's why they're cracking down on bitcoin, because really we all know Apple's crypto DoucheCoin is gonna be the best thing evah! 
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:48:24
He made a prediction. That prediction failed. He also went on to say "storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory". Is that true today? And for the record, that particular quote is in my topic text.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:54:31
Wait, what? No "degenerate" insults in that post? I'm shocked!
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:14:14
It's still got the highest daily volume. And I would expect that this time round the volume is higher than the April crash since there's a lot more people interested in it. 
In April the total was around 80,000. I'd say they're pretty much holding it together.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:44:27
Satoshi predicted the blockchain would be a lot smaller than it is today. How is that not an obvious point from my topic and header?
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:54:25


All I wanted was a fucking discussion. Then dicks like this start showing up.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:10:41
When a writer starts using words like "canard", "Paul clan" and makes excessive use of "quotation marks" around words that make it sound "biased" to most "people", you just can't bring yourself to take it too seriously. 
Fiat money isn't bad because its unstable. Fiat money is bad because it doesn't hold fair market value, being dictated by the state. This lets the state enrich favored parties at the expense of the less-favored. This is why libertarians favor non-state non-fiat media of exchange. Some writers at The Mises Institute have changed their opinion on bitcoin back in favour of it, but you won't find those links in this writers article. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:38:40
I agree. I made that point to show that 0 fee transactions are not "very fast". 
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:02:45
Nah, I never intended to change their business. I'm just letting them know their business isn't really useful anymore. They should know that. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:46:35
Is that for full nodes or just lightweight wallets? Because point 8 of his paper is about lightweight verification of transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:59:45
Dude, shut up! I "obviously" posted this to start a discussion, not insult anyone. But you "obviously" showed up with your troll hat on and started insulting me. So keep your fucking shit to yourself ok? 
In section 7 he's "obviously" talking about full nodes, because he discusses lightweight nodes in section 8. So maybe you need to head back and refresh your fucking degenerate memory, maybe? The point I was making and which is obviously beyond your level of comprehension is that his prediction hasn't happened today, even though we're already hitting the hardware limits. Why the fuck do you have to be a fucktard about this? Couldn't we have had this discussion with your head not firmly stuck up your arse?
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:10:44
It took almost 18 hours for my transaction to move with 0 fees two days ago.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:45:09
That's the point. He was obviously thinking it would be easier to prune and keep the blockchain minimal. But that hasn't been the case.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:34:04
Buttercoin needs to come out already. 
It's ok buttercoin, no one's going to hurt you. You can leave the closet...

+1 for gyft lite idea.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:53:53


For the record, you started this. Don't act all angelic now.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:27:20
This is huge! The Life on Bitcoin couple had a really bad time trying to convince big companies like oil firms to accept bitcoin. Even a small time business in their hometown wouldn't accept it and they kicked Austin out after a short meeting. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:45:08
That doesn't matter! I know MtGox market share has gone down. I'm talking in absolute terms. There system didn't crash even though it went beyond the volume last time this happened. 
By "user base" I meant total bitcoin user base, not MtGox.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:05:19
Uhh... I don't see that
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:20:08
Bwahaha this was hilarious.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:23:56
So bitcoin is at 8 and Paypal is at 6! It's already passed Western Union in transaction volume.
Might be very very soon xD
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:35:35
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:31:35
Upvoted for a good idea. But it's naive. The last thing governments want is transparency. Even if you were to implement this and make it work, I'd be surprised if more than a handful of countries actually used it.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:06:08
Why not find someone on local bitcoins who accepts cash in your region?
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:21:27
Not to mention the computers don't "go fishing over the weekend".
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:40:45
That the blockchain is pretty damn huge.
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:19:25
There is no such thing as "intrinsic value". Gary North [wrote]( on this.


Gold has "value" because people value it. People know its history and understand that it can store wealth compactly and over periods of time. That's all. There is no such thing as an "intrinsic" value in gold, because if there were, that means if everyone in the world were to disappear tomorrow, gold would still be worth something. 
It is us, people, who give value to gold. And it is us, the people, who give value to bitcoin. The value for bitcoin may be different for different people. Take your pick. It could be either pseudo-anonymity, a libertarian anti-government nature, its limited supply, or whatever you see in it. Let's just get the words straight here. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:24:07
Ah now I see it. My bad
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:32:34
... Or into
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:04:37
And yet it is. 
But "obviously" not to you, with your "masterful" brain.

Moving some old.bitcoin from one wallet to the other. Not very urgent work. But the delay was significant if you need things urgently

"Warning: Armory Usability Issues [May, 2013] (Does not affect wallet security)
Armory has become increasingly difficult to use, unless you are on a 64-bit operating system and have 6+ GB of RAM (4+ GB for Linux users). We are aware of the usability issues and should have it resolved in the next few weeks." 
Yeah man, too bad they cant do the 4.2 MB per year thing, right? They should just listen to you, because you're all knowing. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:34:46
I hear stories like this all the time. A guy I know is putting himself through an MBA using bitcoin. Good job learning how to save as a bonus too!
