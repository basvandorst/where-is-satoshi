Who would act as the central bank of PBR?  Any how would the exchanging work?

This poses to be a fascinating question.  I'm thinking full and unopened, but open to hearing other's opinions.
Perhaps half a PBR can could be worth 0.5 PBRcoin, etc?

Colored coins are a good starting point, but they are typically built on top of the Blockchain, correct?
PBRcoin would have its own blockchain and it's supply would be controlled by PBR.  Could a colored coin be built for this?

Yes.  Counter-fitting could be an issue, but I imagine the PBRcoin community could find ways to spot these.
If PBR abused their privilege and created an exorbitant amount of cans, then people could switch to a new coin, perhaps HeinekenCoin or FordCoin.
While this seems comical on the surface, the point here is to demonstrate that altcoins can and should be backed by a variety of goods, products, and services.  This would change the focus away the mining of coins and put it more towards the usage of coins. 
It also gives something more tangible for mainstream users to see as to what is underpinning the intrinsic value of the coin.

This is another intriguing idea.  Definitely has potential to draw a lot of supporters and mining enthusiasts to the PBR factories.
Should the PBRcoin mining operation (the factories) stay physically separate from other coins' mining operations?

Once the beer has left the can, it could be more difficult to verify that it is indeed PBR.  I imagine that the PBRcoin community will develop testing mechanisms (tools, tasting experts, etc) to verify that the beer is indeed PBR.
Does anyone else have an opinion on whether or not the PBR beer should be worth a certain amount of PBRcoin after it has left the can?  Or should 1 PBRcoin have to remain as an unopened can?

Could you please expand on this?  What specifically do you not like about the idea of having a digital currency backed by something physical?

True. Just was curious, seeing as he was such a prominent figure.

Because having a PBRcoin would enable it to have the same beneficial properties of another virtual currency (providing to unbanked, allows for micro-transactions, etc), yet directly addresses the counter-argument as to what specifically undermines the value of the currency.
