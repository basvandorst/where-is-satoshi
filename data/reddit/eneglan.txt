I have a bitcoin backed up in a wallet from a few years ago. Is there anything I need to be aware of using it? That thing with paper wallets and change got me worried.

This is people offloading their BTC into more stable assets while avoiding the tax man, plain and simple.

Man up and take some responsibility.

I've bought through bitpiggy and sold through bitinnovate, both are probably not the cheapest but they both were reliable when I used them.

Pretty sure it had already fallen to about 17 before gox got hacked. Everyone seems to forget that though.

An emotionally attached day trader won't be a day trader for long.

I agree with your post, but this comment makes you sound like an asshole.

"we are rapidly approaching an age of super cheap energy, healthcare, food, water"
ummmm... no we're not...

Seriously just hold them and don't worry about it. If you bought bitcoin because you think they have potential, nothing has changed. If you bought them thinking the recent price rise was sustainable, and not going to have a major correction, you're and idiot.

Bitpiggy is reliable

@_date: 2013-04-25 13:26:58
It definitely does you probably didn't go far enough. I have used it and it's listed here. 
Edit: When you get to step 2 - Payment information the third option is 'Bitcoins via bit-pay.com'

If they'd just get their shit together and buy some servers...

Yeah, it's crazy, I actually had a laugh while I was eating looking at that graph it's so insane. I'm selling half holding half, seems like a safe compromise.

This video is pretty good and seeing you're Australian also.

Yeah, the overuse of exclamation marks really pissed me off. It's like look at me I'm so successful! Our trading engine froze, no big deal because it's all so exciting! oh look again at how successful we are! 
They really should hire a decent PR guy, I think that press release really rubbed people the wrong way.
