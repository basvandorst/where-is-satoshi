I think projecting whether or not we'll still be around in 2140 is pretty pointless.
OP can believe there are virtually infinite halvenings in their lifetime if they want, but it's not the truth.

The only people buying that dip are already billionaires.

I've been with BTC since you could mine on a laptop CPU so I think I might be more of an authority than you are.

You can question whatever you want.
The number of halvenings is FINITE and OP is mistaken.

Taxation is one of the primary hurdles to mainstream adoption.   
Not excited to be giving this info to the IRS, but I would be way less excited to be paid a visit by one of their auditors.

The price tends to drop sharply during the US holiday season, and rise at the conclusion of the Chinese New Year.

The fees and hashrate will eventually reach an equilibrium where miners are making enough money to profit (but just barely) and movement stabilizes quite a bit.  
Once the supply becomes static, the price will only fluctuate based on demand.

They are not infinite! The market will never behave as if they are because it understands this simple fact

Nothing is killing Bitcoin, but I acknowledge that saying so is a bit of a year-end tradition.  
See you all next decade!

There aren't infinite halvenings. Once the last of the BTC is minted, there won't be any more block rewards outside of miner fees.  
Call it a Nothening.
