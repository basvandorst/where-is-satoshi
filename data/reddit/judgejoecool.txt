Yup, most any decent one has 2FA, and then a good strong 30 char password on a keepass file, shiiiiit. If a hacker can get my shit they deserve it.

I like the part where he went from spending a thousand bucks on basically nothing at the time, to flat broke. I wonder how those two situations were related :-p

If you have food money invested in anything other than a checking account  you're failing at life. Investments are for expendible income. Anyone who bought bitcoins with their last dollar and even got rich doing it is still an idiot.

Because it's an absolutely massive platform and it isn't taking it anymore. How would you think the reaction would be if you woke up tomorrow and Amazon didn't take Visa?

Wait, you're telling me people might do unethical things with an anonymous decentralized currency? WHY I NEVER

Amen, everyone wants to talk about how it's the future but it ain't shit if people just want to treat it like a rare comic book.

I think there are definitely drawbacks to bch and I'm ok with people being opposed to it, but I tune them out the second they mention Ver. Tech and opinions are one thing, FUD is always FUD.

It isn't infinitely scalable because it relies on increasing the block sizes, but it's fairly scalable for the near future. 
It's a bandaid not a permanent solution. Look at where Bitcoin transactions were when bch was getting big. Bitcoin (main) could have avoided a lot of headache by applying a bandaid prior to having a true solution.

Cool well I mean, fuck you too? I wasn't criticizing it, I was explaining the poster aboves claim that it wasn't scalable. I think it is more than scalable for the near future. 
But it's cool that you wanted to flex nuts on a crypto forum
