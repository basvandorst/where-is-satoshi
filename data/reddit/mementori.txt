I remember seeing the previews for it in theaters and being really excited for it. It looks really great.
@_date: 2014-03-20 17:04:52
yup. I love hearing this news and I honestly wish the best for second market, I think what they are doing is great - just not for me. For me, I like being in control of my money directly. I have even learned Python (still huge newb, but a lot more confident) just so I can compile my own wallet application for personal use - just so I then rely on absolutely ZERO third party. Not that I don't trust Mycelium, Blockchain.info, Electrum, Armory or Bitcoin Core - they are all fantastic. I just really love bitcoin for this reason so it is nice to be able to completely embrace it.

You're being down voted but you raise a valid point. While you may be wrong (or right, or something in between) , I'd much rather see someone prove them wrong than people down vote with nothing constructive to say.

It's true, not all of it is due to not wanting competition... Most of it is probably avoiding getting fucked by the long arm of the law due to the grey area of regulations 
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:30:51
well some people prefer the security of a bank. I also think we will see some very convenient payment terminals coming from these "bitcoin banks" - similar to what CoinKite and NeoBee are doing.
Besides, there's nothing wrong with them if they can be openly audited (like CoinKite). Nobody needs to use it if they don't want to,  I know for a fact that there will be less tech-savvy people who are more comfortable doing it that way. 
Myself? I feel pretty secure in my own methods and love "being my own bank", but I gladly welcome these types of organizations.

Hurts bitcoin's current market rate, yes, but it does not hurt bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 07:46:28
I predict that banks will start embracing bitcoin and offering a way to securely store it via web wallet, just like your checking account. Obviously it will not catch on with all, but they already have a lot of the best security experts in finance on payroll and equipment on hand, I'm sure they could implement it. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 03:32:34
Well it is optional, not forced. For some business you want to have this type of trust. I've been scammed personally 2 times (maybe 3 if openrigs never sends my order... Been waiting for 4 months...) Because I paid with bitcoin. I still use bitcoin for payments often BC I love it and believe in it, but those 2 times hurt. It sucks not being able to see if the business you are working with is legit if the only info you can find on them is not able to be trusted either. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:45:16
which is why it is kind of awesome... people are still finding it more valuable to run at a loss and collect btc than to just not... obviously the system isn't perfect by any means but it is a work in progress and a beautiful experiment regardless
@_date: 2014-05-21 17:05:13
This is a good article. I am looking forward to see what Circle brings to the table. I am also glad to see that they are taking their time to deliver a good product. People shouldn't complain - they are doing everything they can to avoid becoming the next Gox...

why not both? 
Providing social change and economic benefit to a lot of people- himself, sellers and buyers alike. For example there were people who would have to pay way higher prices for lower quality 'goods' locally. Silkroad provided an incentive but most importantly the ability for the buyer to find a new seller in a much safer manner.

@_date: 2014-09-18 19:53:26
can confirm - made an awesome bet on betsofbitco.in well over a year before the conclusion (had previously been paid out by them) - when it came time to pay up, the site stopped closing bets and then eventually just shut down.

hey tmobile this is a very easy opportunity to win a shit ton of customers by embracing bitcoin. accept payment in bitcoin - it will be great publicity, give you a new loyal market, all at essentially no risk to you with coinbase or bitpay.  You could even save on transaction costs, essentially making more in profit or being able to undercut competition.

Neo &amp; Bee is definitely not anything like pirateat40. They have been very open with communication and very active within the community (as well as taking the time to respond in this thread!)... but it is true that they are not meeting their set dates, which is very important to prove legitimacy within launch.
Though let's be real - there are a ton of unexpected issues that can come up, especially considering they are implementing a disruptive tech in a regulation heavy industry like finance/banking. Its not like there's many businesses that have even gotten this far outside of Coinbase/Bitpay/BIPS, which doesn't apply too much since Neo &amp; Bee will be a different type of business in a completely different jurisdiction. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:20:18
I do. The name definitely make you think they wouldn't approach most issues impartially, but in reality they have some damn fine journalism over there. At least from what I've read and known of them.

But trustworthy. He literally was the first to sell asics not on preorder. He probably tries to stay anonymous out of safety... From both individuals and governments. He is based in China, which has been a point of concern these past few months, but what they do doesn't seem to interfere with PBOC rulings. That doesn't mean there won't be a bigger crackdown later though. As for now, he certainly has my trust. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:53:15
true, but BlockChain.info is hands down one of the most reputable out there. Hell, our Lord and Savior Andreas Antonopoulos works for them, I think it should be considered pretty legit - especially when compared to all of the other ones out that are made/run by.... who exactly?

@_date: 2014-04-28 13:52:48
What a terrible name. Why does it have to be bitcoin related? If you're dead set on it referencing bitcoin how about naming it something like "nuance" or "21 million" or "satoshi" or "petahash" or something

@_date: 2014-06-19 18:29:22
Yup me too man. Was on their site checking it out, thought it was an interesting business model, then saw they accept btc and I was a paid member in 30 seconds
@_date: 2014-02-23 23:03:33
probably similar to how Bridgewalker (android app) does it... or maybe they hold fiat as fiat if the customer chooses to not hold as bitcoin.

I believe you could write a script that would take the input amount, divide by two and send to each of your predetermined addresses. I guess technically you would have to trust each other and/or the machine running the client, but I don't think it would be -that- hard to get right.
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:16:17
I certainly feel that way, though I do pay them. I think it's natural to be angry at the system for forcing you to pay the money, yet having an insanely small say in how it is spent.

it really does prove that the reporter did hardly any research on who he was quoting for his story, or he probably would have seen 'evoorhees' post (or many other statements from him) on the front page of r/bitcoin a few days ago - the complete opposite image the reporter was portraying. Now this would be a different story if he was trying to expose Erik as actually lacking faith in bitcoin, but I think it was just incompetence on the reporter's end.
thank you u/evoorhees, I really respect you for being a knowledgeable and eloquent voice in our community.

The SEC has no right to try to regulate authority over mpex, that is most definitely what this is about. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:48:22
yeah, why would you do otherwise OP? I don't understand why you wouldn't just bring them back with you to insure you do not get scammed, especially since you are paying the money to fly out there anyway.
If you don't want to have to try and fly back with them, at the very least buy them and then ship them yourself from a post office or shipping store in the buyers city back to your home.
@_date: 2014-05-11 03:09:08

asicminer - they seem to be the only one thinking long term as far as mining goes. the immersion cooling techniques bundled with shipping containers of mining equipment has great potential for future use when the difficulty will make mining a much more competitive industry.

Coingig - vendor said he was sending 2 USB miners, actually sent over 2 128mb SD cards (class 2 at that!) To be clear coingig did not scam me (though they said one one section of their site escrow was provided on every transaction, but on another section of the site it was contradictory)
This one hurts - betsofbitco.in
They used to be active, I got paid out on multiple bets until January or so the admin fell of the map. Unfortunately for me I had a bet placed in march of 2013 saying that the seahawks would go to the Superbowl. At the time bitcoin was sub $100 and I had bet .2 I believe. The bets are time weighted so the earlier you vet the better your payout of you win. The opposing side had more bets than my side and I won! Woohoo! 0.5 btc was mine with btc around $800! Imagine my disappointment when I never get paid out and again a few weeks ago when the site finally went offline. :(
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:27:34
That is a poor way to phrase what you're trying to say, and possibly false. 
If mining becomes so unprofitable the assumption is that less people will be running their rigs, thereby decreasing the hashrate/difficulty. In reality there will probably be people running their rigs at a loss waiting on others to drop out or mining thinking long term. 
I will be surprised if we see much of a drop in hashrate, especially with a few of the terrahash gen miners soon to launch

Certainly is an interesting concept, but I think the creator said it best, "If bitcoin is the toy version of what we'll all be using in the future, then I want to build the crazy art project version of the future."

Actually I do call that getting bitcoin - because you are getting bitcoin. I didn't say you could live off if it.

If you build it, I will gladly help moderate and review claims. I personally have been scammed multiple times with the use of bitcoin (just check my past posts) and the current solutions (r/betterbitcoinbureau for one) are good, but are not big enough to get the proper views before people get scammed. I also know HTML &amp; CSS, learning Python, though none of these are good enough to build said site, but enough to maintain one.
PM me if you are interested in the help.

I got fucked on coingig due to contrasting statements in the help and FAQ pages regarding escrow... Read my history for more info. It happened last summer I believe. Never ordered through them again but always checked what was new about once or twice a week. Sorry to see them go but hopefully we see etsy or someone else take bitcoin as a payment option. There does not seem to be the consumer base to only support bitcoin, but accepting bitcoin/crypto and fiat would be a win win for everyone.

As a proud owner of a Piper, good luck! I still recommend your product to anyone interested in cold storage methods, and have given many paper wallets away bc of my Piper. Looking forward to what else you guys will create.

Bc they did something great? Don't be so quick to vilify Jason King. No matter if some of the contributions may or may not have been handled inappropriately, he has provided thousands of meals to the homeless which is exactly what people donated for.

Which is exactly what a piper does....
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:15:29
excellent theory
but I've wondered what if it turns out mark was actually in a similar situation but instead of trying to make things right in a "noble" manner, it turns out he was nakowa (sp?) on just-dice...

So how do you accomplish this? You casually note that you have that covered, when really those are the biggest hurdles for any exchange it seems.
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:37:07
Its okay though, we do nothing.

@_date: 2014-03-24 16:38:22
Thanks for the info. I wonder if it will confirm like in the case you gave or cancel like the last time I had this happen. If it does cancel and come back, do you have any idea how I could transfer the entire balance to another address?
@_date: 2014-04-03 17:34:31
hell yeah that was surprisingly well put. I'm glad these governmental agencies are starting to actually understand how cryptocurrencies work, and making informed, reasonable regulation around it.

Public, well lit place (credit union lobby is ideal IMO), bring a trustworthy friend (a large, intimidating one if possible haha), don't deal with more than you can truly afford to be robbed of (I know that would mean nothing but really maybe only buy 1k at a time.. At least until you find someone trustworthy) and above all only deal with people with established ratings. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 00:15:44
Its already too late. Now you have millionaires and billionaires invested... Especially outspoken libertarians like Overstocks CEO who would make it very political. 
Not to mention it would be blatantly anti free market and anti capitalism 
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:55:15
gotta agree here. until there is a service that can be used, it hurts having products not deliver on time (or at all, or purposefully sent wrong item) and knowing there is no protection on the consumer end. I don't blame the protocol, because there are ways to build around that. Until that day comes though, I only use bitcoin to purchase online through places with legit customer service like Gyft, Overstock, Tigerdirect; merchants who provide real names and contact info; and a few of the original bitcoin stores with a proven track record (Roger Ver's for example)
@_date: 2014-07-14 06:15:37
I have read the arguments but personally I just don't get it, I think they do a fine job. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 17:12:07
They could be associated with award winning start ups like Coinbase and be viewed as innovative.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:38:21
actually there are multiple businesses that accept bitcoin in austin. Downtown you can look on Rainey street for two food trucks that accept bitcoin, and if you head northwest into Leander (okay so technically not austin) you can buy groceries/beer/etc...
Not to mention Brave New Books, Central Texas Gunworks, the multiple atms, some cabs and you can most definitely find vendors willing to trade btc for goods. I'm also pretty sure that there will be a some btc related businesses at SXSWi since it is the hottest tech start up space out there and btc start ups are picking up as well.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:47:15
Gox has certainly done shady things in the past... Not processing fiat withdraws for one. The whole lawsuit in regards to alidian (sp... On my mobile)... Overall lack of clear communication in regards to customers funds... Platform issues (April crash)
I personally haven't used gox in well over 6 months for these reasons alone and I feel very bad for anyone who has money stuck with them.

You're missing the point. You and the person I replied to are generalizing everyone when in fact there are many different views here. Being purposefully ignorant is a bad way to go about making a point as you are immediately discrediting yourself. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 00:11:52
No way that is true... I believe they are keeping everything quiet so they launch with a complete product. Who knows, maybe they will open some of the first U.S. ATMs.

I ordered mine on black friday, it did take a while to arrive but rest assured it did (I want to say ~1 month?) and I absolutely love it. It definitely doesn't get enough love around here.
edit: I ordered it 12/1/14, he stated there were shipping delays due to high volume of orders on 12/10/14 and threw in a few rolls of thermal paper, arrived on 12/19/14. I live in Texas for what it's worth.
@_date: 2014-05-11 03:01:24
this is my favorite option. the guy running it is legit, the business is fully legit (I have used it multiple times)
it used to be called steamloader if that rings any bells. they now sell more than just steam gc and add more regularly. i assume the name change also had to do with avoiding copyright/trademark issues.
I am not affiliated with this business at all, just spoken with the owner via email a few times regarding my order (after he sent the code)
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:15:58
If encrypted like he mentioned I think it would be fine
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:41:51
is there anyway to do this via bitcoin?

This could be solved with side chains which are merge mined.

Yes! Pass by it everyday on my way home, the bitcoin symbol really stands out too. I bet that was on purpose. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 07:10:09
hell yeah good idea OP - but just as u/onetallnerd said, don't spam small amounts you can't even withdraw, but tip like a quarter or so at least. Give OC posts a buck if it's good! This is a chance to show people who may have dismissed or not understood bitcoin to experience it first hand.

With bitpay you can have instant btc to USD conversion for free. I fail to see how that costs money or even requires you to hold any bitcoin if you don't want to. 
That is what he meant by there's no reason not to accept it for payments. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:13:47
I disagree, asicminer, knc, hell even active mining/AMC/VMC all have products soon to launch. I think we will start seeing the most established with infrastructure, experience and ~~capitol~~ capital all take the lead. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:02:15
I doubt we will see anything bitcoin related there. I wouldn't be surprised if eventually they get into it, but with all the grey area and the uncertainty in the mainstream they probably don't mind waiting until there's more solid ground. I'm positive they are keeping an eye on it and they obviously have funded some projects, but major 1st party projects are likely far away. Just my thoughts of course. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:16:22
probably most who also had money stuck in there...
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:57:21
Has no one here ever heard of empeopled? 
They have been doing something similar for quite a while now. I heard about them from where would post some excellent analysis weekly. I thought it was his blog at first, but no, it was a this glorious site. It's not perfect, but damn they do a good job of trying to democratize everything. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 00:24:46
Nice. I got mine too today, at a perfect time. I went to buy a humble bundle, I always pay in btc but thought I only had about $1 worth in there. I log in and was surprised to see money from coinbase in there. Fuck yeah I donated more than the average amount thanks to that :)

@_date: 2015-01-12 21:03:40
whoa, this is big. I'm going to check this out further after work. Quick question, what happens if there is btc sent to one of the site addresses? Is the site owner able to access those btc? Seems like a great way to tip some content providers directly.
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:32:40
hmm and really if you paid in btc at the time (or didn't, but you can think of it as if you would of bought with btc) then you could potentially make more coins than you could of purchased - all depending on when you made the purchase that is.
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:35:55
FULLY AGREE!
Fuck half these people calling for slush/Trezor/SL to fail. While I agree they haven't handled this the best, they clearly have worked hard on this project just to have some knockoff try to reap the rewards without offering ANYTHING new (and actually making a more unsafe version). 
I will never support this company.
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:10:05
The exchange rate doesn't define bitcoin. It will go on and it will be just as exciting to the ones that appreciate the concept. It's just as useful at $1 as it is at $1000.

@_date: 2015-01-05 23:38:24
Would be great if they used the opportunity to settle payments between each other via btc, though I doubt they will for a variety of reasons. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:31:41
As much as I love bitcoin, I absolutely hate the way the majority of the community reacts to things. IMO Trezor/satoshilabs has every right to be pissed a clone came along and is trying to reap the rewards of satoshilabs hard work. Now all of these bitcoiners are calling Trezor/sl unprofessional and generally treating them like shit. Yeah it does look like they made a mistake making it completely open source, they only did it to prove that the product they were making was honest. To my understanding, by changing to the new license now people can audit the code but not steal it. That seems perfectly fair to me! Obviously it's not ideal that they switched, but you can't blame them for being pissed.
@_date: 2014-09-02 14:25:37

Yes I love lawnmower! I've been using them for about a month now, and while I have had some issues with my Chase account, lawnmower support has really gone above and beyond keeping me in the loop and letting me know what is going on.

@_date: 2015-02-24 16:24:44
They are just trying to make the processes as streamlined as possible, since that is something which can intimidate the average joe. Overall I support the method coinbase is going for, but I am glad that bitpay has the BIP70 option for those who disagree or don't have coinbase.  
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:03:01

@_date: 2016-07-22 14:51:57
Why would Coinbase throw their business away over a legal subpoena of one guy? Cmon he really should not have been using THE MOST regulated exchange in the most regulated country... Make that wallet yourself and sell on btc-e or OTC. It's his own fault for going that route.
@_date: 2013-06-13 05:23:19
Hell yeah man I will try this out tomorrow. Lemme know if ya need any help regarding print work... Just sayin, without internet it might be handy to have something to print out with instructions and a deposit address w/qr code. I can design (i have a few custom paper wallets and templates I've already made that would work great...and have access to very nice printing presses if you want to print anything yourself.
Shoot me a pm if interested or wanna talk other ideas. Will obviously work for btc. Either way, fantastic idea! Will definitely be sharing this with my other btc peeps.
@_date: 2013-06-20 17:29:45
Personally I would rather see a woot-like bitcoin deal-a-day website... Maybe something for bitcoinstore.com to tackle

@_date: 2013-07-08 13:47:37
I think gaming should fully embrace bitcoin. I understand why companies like Zynga wouldn't want to utilize it whenever they can offer their own credits for microtransactions, but for anyone wanting to wager a match online (Starcraft, any FPS, tons of pay-to-play games) bitcoin would be perfect and because they are giving more access and use to bitcoin, the companies own bitcoin reserves should raise in value. Hell, maybe they could even exchange bitcoins to customers.
I wish I knew how to code.

No worries, just felt that since he (alanX) puts so much work into organizing these he deserves some slack for the post. 
You should come sometime though, it is fun and very interesting to have so many different backgrounds and views on bitcoin. I was surprised I wasn't able to buy any btc off of anyone at the last one I went to. Then again, I don't want to sell my btc either ;)
Do you have any bitcoin related projects that you are working on?

still way easier to buy and sell on market

And none of these places have to exchange for USD, or "actual money" as you call it. I am sure a lot of merchants who accept bitcoin keep some btc and exchange some for fiat.

Or if you're able to just use localbitcoins exclusively. I pretty much have three different people I sent a text message to to see if they have enough I can buy off of them. 
Between that and coinbase I dont even mess with fort gox or bitstamp or any other exchange. Bitfloor was the last "easy" exchange.

I appreciate that. You may also want to know that I couldn't get into minefield whenever I first tried clicking on it, but after I went to bitstamp then clicked on "Apps" up top, I was able to access minefield. I tried this multiple times and the bug repeated. Weird.

because it is automated and a fee will be automatically included without you doing anything. think of a shop owner or like the OP mentioned in the office.
you could have a script set up so whenever a cash deposit is received, if you have the fiat in a bank account, you purchase the equivalent amount from coinbase or whatever as soon as the old bitcoin leave your account.

The seller that was honest and sent me the right product was RunBTC.
The seller that I have an issue with is Jakes_ASICS. I immediately placed a review on his page once opening the package saying that he did not send what I ordered at all (from the Buy orders menu, after clicking view invoice). After I typed the review, I went to his page to see if my review was there and all it said was "No reviews found"
The support page I linked to is also on your home page, which is where I found that information (and what I have been looking at all along). I am glad you are helping me handle this now, but this is extremely discouraging, especially considering I was investing that money into something I would (hopefully) be getting a return on. 
I had been speaking with the seller beforehand, he sent me a picture of a block erupter unit with my name and the date on the paper. I figured that would be good enough. That was my only form of protection against this kind of situation, since the seller didn't have escrow turned on.
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:14:58
Yeah not that hard to understand... OP you're either an idiot or trolling, I'm going to assume both.

Difficulty is always rising, but ASICMiner is solo-mining at the rates of the largest pools. Your shares are also not mining bonds, but an investment in a company which reliably sells and ships hardware and mines with the hardware they produce. The stock is not tied to 1 share = 1mh/s. Those PMBs will be harder to get a return on your investment, though certainly not impossible.

Also doesn't mean its a bad idea. I have issues with the associated fees without insuring my funds, but I'm pretty impressed with their ability to launch a product and POS terminal in a relatively short time.

An escrow service does exsist, but as one of the owners of coingig mentioned above, they changed it a week ago, which is after I placed my order (June 7). Also, on their support page it says this


[Support page with this information](
@_date: 2013-06-04 02:30:28
Probably due to the irreversibly of bitcoin transactions that coingig holds funds until the transaction is finalized. If they lie, you probably have proof from tracking numbers and whatnot. I'm just guessing, I have no knowledge on the subject.
@_date: 2013-07-22 05:31:05

I too have loved bitfloor for the ease of use with cash @ BoA. I have used bitinstant and gotten burn multiple times with very long delays and no customer support. Yesterday was the first time I had an issue with bitfloor/localtill, and (of course) it was while I was transferring a large amount. 
I woke up this morning (~15 hrs later) and it was there. I am not happy with the situation (as I would of been buying in ~190 instead of 206), but I definitely understand that shit happens. They obviously didn't take the issue lightly and got it resolved in less than a day.
I hope to see bitfloor stay in the game. I feel that they are way more reliable with localtill than mtgox + bitinstant, even in light of my recent order. Hopefully they can find a way to pay back what they owe in some way.
I'll keep using you guys if you stay open and honest with customer about what's going on.
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:46:43

Bingo. Put a bit into bitfloor due to a shitty experience with bitinstant and didn't buy when it was around 78, then watched it drop with mtgox staying lower than bitfloor the whole time. Bitfloor is not great for buying right now.

I purchased the real one from a user called RunBTC (he has since closed his store, but he shipped from the Seattle area and it was a good transaction) 
I placed this order over a week ago. Why can I not place a review on his page? That doesn't make any sense to me. It also doesn't make any sense how you will release payment to him whenever he marked it as shipped, even though he gave a **FAKE** tracking number. There seems to be no buyer protection on coingig at all, unless escrow is on. I was under the impression that it was on after reading this on your support page

That's a pretty strong assumption to make. What's to stop litecoin devs from implementing a feature like zerocoin before bitcoin does to prevent the use of whitelisting? That would give litecoin a tremendous advantage over bitcoin. I may be wrong in my understanding of zerocoin, but I think you understand the point I am trying to make here.

Maybe, but I think anyone could then mine a vanity address that is just as similar and use that.
but at this point wouldn't you need a smartphone or computer of some sorts to verify? why wouldn't you just make the transaction normally? 
Maybe if there is someway to have a "one time private key" with each transaction... but I doubt that is possible.

It doesn't run as a mobile app and you can host it yourself, significantly removing the risk of someone else blocking access or gaining access to your funds. I don't know how apple could ban this without routing everyone through their proxy, thereby censoring the open web.

What about a credit union which follows all KYC/AML regs and promotes the use of bitcoin. 
It could work similar to coinbase, except instead of utilizing ACH they would have access to the funds internally (from you depositing cash or check into their branch, or whatever other traditional methods)
They would of course have the private key while you hold the btc in your account, but you could always transfer the btc out. 
I know the internet archive had started something similar, but I wonder why they had to shut down. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:04:42

If you want to hear what others think, you could start by reading every other post asking the same thing on here. There are multiple posts each week asking very similar things. The community gets a bit jaded after a while.
I will answer you though, to not be a total dick. From my perspective, unless you have something like $50k USD that you are okay with possibly losing, you won't make $120k/yr. Estimates for difficulty are getting close to 50% a month (by some people's estimates), not 10%. 
Also, anything could happen as far as the USD/BTC exchange rate goes. There are just too many variables to try to accurately guess what it will be. 
My favorite resource for estimating mining profitability is mining.thegenesisblock.com , which is hands down the best mining calculator out there. Hope this helps.
@_date: 2013-07-22 05:39:35

It's pretty hard to deny there is a need for it when you have at least three businesses providing that service and doing well.

I like his answer, though I disagree with him. He does make a good point about having your phone charged though, but I think that anyone only holding bitcoin and needing that bitcoin to get around will make sure their wallet is accessible, though we are quite far from that point IMHO

Coinbase and bitpay don't work well together. It has to do with the way Coinbase broadcasts transactions I believe. Since gyft uses bitpay, that was probably where your problem occurred.

This is great. Don't sweat these major doubters, they most likely have no understanding of the technicalities involved. You and your team seem to have done a great amount of research and work and I am very excited to see a well thought out business hitting this part of the market.

Also, on the Pisti cards, please consider having QR codes on the cards themselves for quick deposits (I'm sure you've already thought this out though!)
Now I do have a question (though this is open for anyone to answer)... in regards to the news that the US might make it illegal for a US Citizen to open a bank account overseas, do you think this type of account will be able to be used by those of us in the US? I will definitely create an account if I am able to, even if only to help support you guys.

I make paper wallets for fun (I work for a printing company) so this idea has been something that has intrigued me for quite some time.
I cannot seem to find a way to overcome this hurdle though. BIP38 makes things a bit easier as far as having an exposed private key goes, but it mostly is good for just paper wallets. If the source of the blocknote was from an untrustworthy source, the private key could not match up to the public address shown to verify. 
Good luck, please keep us updated if you make a breakthrough!

The US isn't run by a bunch of monkeys, as some people would like to think. They understand that by allowing law abiding citizens to continue using it without worry of counterfeit/tax evasion/money laundering charges, as long as they pay taxes the government wins... at least for now. The fact of the matter is true bitcoin believers make up something along the lines of 25-30% f current users (my entirely made up figure). Everyone else is looking to make USD from BTC. They buy BTC, sit on it, watch value rise, exchange it to USD, record gains, and pay taxes on said gains. Which would be entirely legal. Sure the US would rather USD be used to purchase goods, which could have sales tax put on them. Sure they would rather know they are getting all of the taxes they can out of you by personally monitoring your bank accounts. Sure they would rather you give them 20-60% of your hard earned debtpaper so they can support wars, corporations, politicians that you do not agree with.
If the US wants to really make money and end national debt, they should embrace bitcoin and watch value skyrocket. Pay off debt, not have to worry about direct control, spend 5 billion on NASA. 
Or maybe I've just smoked too much tonight.
