Yeah your correct about the 21 million maybe also something around the fact “gold 2.0” and look into the qr code more maybe it just needs a YouTube video or a article

with the limited space I would add how it has a limit of 21 million coins and maybe a short link/qr code that goes to a link that has more information.
