Maybe in the Machiavellian sense.

Yes, I'd like to think most here are aware of all that, but there are a lot of people with no interest in the technical details, they just want something that works and thanks to the media holding up MtGox at every opportunity, I wouldn't be surprised if there are more than a few people that consider MtGox to **be** bitcoin.

If you lose your paycheck on the way home from work, you still have to pay the tax.

Just because a bunch of "journalists" are being shitbags doesn't mean everybody else should do the same, leave the memes to dogecoin.

Obviously it varies by locale but some jurisdictions consider the transaction to have the applicable fiat value, you're free to accept that value in cabbages if you want. How you pay tax on the change of value of those cabbages if you eventually decide to convert them to fiat is a question for a local tax expert.

Personally I'd prefer at least burn-in testing to ensure what turns up at the door works rather than waste time fucking around with RMAs.

Way I'm reading that is that they think that their decision is the way the EU is going to go, we aren't just talking about the UK market.

For Bitcoin to gain acceptance, it needs to be as pain free as possible for everybody to use, so really it has become everyone else's problem.

No, the analogy works. You say Google is dead and people are going to be "OMFG! How will I find what I am looking for??!?!" without thinking that their are a pile of other search engines. Thanks to the media, MtGox has been shoved down many throats and many would make the association that MtGox=bitcoin.

Mules. That money probably belonged to someone else.

Would have been better had they mentioned that ToR was developed by the US Navy.

Penalties for possession are the same.

That has never been proven. just because McKenna spat that out at one point, doesn't make it true. You show me a cited article I may believe you.
@_date: 2012-02-03 17:05:56
Yes. Typo on my part. My bad.

I heard a story a while ago about tomato growers running diesel generators to supply them with CO2 and feeding the excess power back into the grid.

Holy shit, if I understand you correctly (and it makes a hell of a lot of sense in hindsight):
* I have a wallet with coins in it
* Fork happens
* Wallet with coins magically has Fork coins in it, but I can't see them with by BTC hat on
* I transfer coins from my old wallet to a new wallet, old wallet still looks empty with my BTC hat on
* I put on my Fork Coin hat, now, I can see the fork coins in the old wallet
* Wearing Fork Coin hat, new wallet is empty as they are on a different chain.
I don't recall seeing this spelled out in such a way before (if I did, I failed to grok it)

People don't NEED to combine into pools. They just do so to absorb statistical variance. With hashrate x, an individual may expect to solve a block in time y, but this is a statistical measurement, there is no guarantee the individual will ever manage to solve a block. So I guess it could be argued that this is another case where a technically superior solution is undermined by human nature.  
EDIT: That said, there is no reason why the number of pools should be small. Given the issues of allowing anybody control over majority share of the network, the community should self-regulate to ensure no pool is allowed to attain that position.

IIRC that drop of AMD stock is due to their CPU division borking things.

Attacking a large pool effectively removes a large amount of processing power which increases rate of profit for other pools. This can be pushed further, by attacking enough pools to ensure that the pool you control has more than 51% control you can start forging transactions.

You can't trade it for goods, but you can use it to settle incurred debt.

Bitcoin is designed such that the number of bitcoins in existence is a function of time, not of computing power. So increasing profits isn't a matter of throwing more compute power at the problem, it is an issue of increasing the proportion of compute power you control.
@_date: 2011-05-30 17:04:09
This is why one should join a pool, you get credit for shares of the block solved without being negatively affected too much by a poor latency.

Those numbers in your account aren't real money, they are a contract from the bank promising to give you future money, a contract they can withdraw at any time.

Coins can and do get destroyed every time somebody loses their wallet. They may not actually get destroyed but unlike real money, there is nobody walking along the footpath behind you to find it.

Same way that cheque processing works, somebody gives you a cheque and you take it to your bank and your bank gives you money,  the banks pile up all these cheques and and determine a total amount they are owed by each other bank and transfer only the difference. In reality, money is rarely moved between banks because over a long  enough period of time the amount they owe each other is generally nothing. BTC transferred to and from MtGox are on the blockchain but every transaction between MtGox users is internal to MtGox. This is how microtransactions can be implemented by third parties.

So in order to retrieve the dust owed to you by a Nigerian prince you have to send him 1 BTC first?

That's not completely accurate, you charge them with everything possible and then the 'iffy' ones can get traded away in plea bargaining, teh exception comes if there is a reasonable expectation of collecting more evidence.
