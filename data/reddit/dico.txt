Analysis Bitcoin and talk about what affect Bitcoin price. For example, Bitcoin price increase because of new fork, political event, big bank accept Bitcoin etc. You can do it daily if you are able to find something that affect the price.

If you can build a web site with this concept, you will get lot of traffic. You can pull price feed and alert users too when the price reach certain point.

2 Weeks to 10 December. Lets see what will happen.

Year 2018 BTC probably hit $100K!

I am wondering how it work in practice since Bitcoin transaction take at least 10 minutes blocktime?

If Coinbase not working for you, try LocalBitcoin.

Bitcoin debit card charge a high fee per transaction. They will do instant conversion with huge margin to minimize loss.

Beside transaction time, another issue for Bitcoin is having high transaction fee. I would suggest to use alternative coin like ETH and BTS which confirm the transaction within a minute with a low transaction fee. Just my 2 cent

Approach local bitcoin community and ask them who are able to do BTC to Cash on the spot.

You need to increase the fee and it depend on what software you use to send Bitcoin. If the software not allow you to increase the fee, what you can do is wait.

If everyone pay BTC like you around the world, BTC will go to the moon.

Give them the private key and let them guess what is it. If they are confuse, most likely they don't know what is Bitcoin, then introduce Bitcoin to them.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:58:05
Then another Bitcoin hard fork happen and this will push BTC price go up further.

If you know Chinese, you may use MyToken.io for IOS and Android Apps.

The 3% credit card fee is insignificant compare to the potential of price increase for Bitcoin x10 x100.

Possible but large capital is required to make this happen. This is same as other future products too.

$15-20K is not worth your effort to start an LLC. Anyway, invest with family and friends mean they will take profit and you need to take the loss. That why you see so many comments above mention this is not viable.

Invest in Bitcoin is better than invest in Gold.

I like this kind of Exchange. Place a pending order with very low price and wait it crash.
