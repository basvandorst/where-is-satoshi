No but I can learn :-)

Of course you could lose money.  But at the rate that I want to try it, it won't be that much of a loss :-)

Hmm... so you don't just cash out when the value goes up?

How widely does it fluctuate from day-to-day?  I would like to attempt something like that, but only with $10 to see if I could do anything.

Low risk if I'm just putting money into my coinbase wallet because even when it goes down, bitcoin is not going away for a while.  If there happens to be a hacking, or the whole floor drops out of the bottom of bitcoins making them worthless or something of that nature I will have only lost 10 dollars.  If it stabilizes under the value I put in, I will have permanently lost my money, but again, at most 10 dollars.

I didn't understand that's how it worked.

What makes it pathetic?  I'm not asking you for money.  I just thought it would be fun to do.  In fact all I'm planning on doing is buying bitcoins from coinbase, and sitting on them until the value goes up and maybe selling off of that (that is withdraw back to my bank account).
If you don't like the idea of making money off of it, then you didn't actually have to reply.  In fact you can just down vote it without so much as a word to me and it would not make a difference.
I also want to qualify my response by saying I'm not planning on buying or selling to individuals, so I'm not scamming anyone and no one is going to scam me in that way.  Not only that but I'm not planning on doing this in huge sums.  I liken it to buying and selling penny stocks.

Because I can potentially play it like the stock market at tiny incremenets and not have to deal with a broker, and am totally in control of what I do with it.

I put up another post about making money but apparently the title sounds spammy since I haven't gotten any decent advice on that thread yet.  Thanks for the info (that I didn't thank you for the other day).
What do you mean by "take liquidity out of the market" ?
