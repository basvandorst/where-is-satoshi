Could be consolidating accounts or moving from a legacy account to a SegWit account on the Trezor. A single Trezor can have unlimited wallets, basically.

I have a 13, 9 and 7 year old. I don’t even talk about Bitcoin that much but kids pick stuff up. My 7 year old told me he was going to buy Vbucks with his two bitcoin last week. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Lol. Yeah. He ain’t got two bitcoins. He had two gold dollars.

Worked like a charm. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:49:16
Working as intended!

Agreed. Also the link to the list of trolls was posted by a self-admitted troll. This place makes my head hurt sometimes.

I've got an old MacBook Pro that I started running as a full node. 4GB RAM, Dual-Core Intel processor, plenty of HD space. Thing is, it's been running for over a week straight and I'm at 25 active connections with 35 weeks of transactions to go. Is that normal?

It's the same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.

You realize your link to the list of trolls was posted by a self-admitted troll as a joke, right?

* 1) Maybe the computer/drive was stolen and sold. 
* 2) Why would you mail it back to a rummage sale?
* 3) Perhaps he/she had other things on the drive that they wanted back. 
* 4) It could have just been a backup. 
Also, try not to be such a dick to people. Maybe he made up the story, or maybe he lurked here and thought it would be a good place to ask, who cares?

I bought a rather expensive Alienware computer from Dell. It never worked properly. It had cooling issues, sounded like a jet taking off most of the time. Constant BSODs, front panel was broken. I spent weeks on the phone with them trying to just get a refund and get the PoS out of my house. Finally, posted a letter on the BBB. A customer service rep called me within a day and arranged to have it picked up and a full refund given. 
It's worth a shot, especially the way they've jerked you around. I always thought Gateway and HP had terrible service. Dell made them look like competent businesses.

I paid a teenager $30 in Bitcoin several times to now my yard in 2015. He texted me those transactions today are worth $700. However, I spent and replaced.  Good on him for saving his.

I think it’s awesome too. It would be the one I picked out of all the prints. The Satoshi quotes one is really cool as well. Don’t listen to the trolls, you’re awesome.

What site is that?
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:04:14
Awesome! Thanks for the tip!

Howdy from Arkansas! Fingers crossed we break $300/BTC today!
