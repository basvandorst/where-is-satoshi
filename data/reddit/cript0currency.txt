anyone else think its bitcoin miners who are behind spam attacks? They seem to be the only ones who benifit
@_date: 2017-04-08 06:44:29
paper wallets are the safest. Or you can try installing bitcoin core on a computer that has never been connected to the web. No need  to download  the entire blockchain just keep creating addresses and use the console command: dumpprivkey "bitcoinaddress"   to  get the private keys  then use coinb.in
@_date: 2017-04-21 18:58:58
before these spam attacks it was ok, the tx would still confirm in less then 48h

use bitaddress.org to create a lot of paper addresses then use coinb.in to move coins, change must be moved to a separate address also

considering the current spam attack; that 1 hour could have cleared 12,000 of the 25,000 unconfirmed transactions (6 block x 2000tx/blk) wtf if going on with the difficulty its too high!
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:00:06
it goes up to $500 after a month, $2000 after three months. it might be faster if you have successfully added money or buy/sell bitcoins. After a few months more you will be up to $10,000  it depends on time and buying/selling bitcoin without any legal entity challenging your transactions. As long as your legit it will go up to $10,000 before the year is over
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:49:52

@_date: 2017-05-22 17:30:50
will this be towards UASF  or mining implemented counting towards segwit.co
@_date: 2017-05-15 00:36:02
how can we user activate segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:43:13
its not practical in usa, electricity costs are too much. try purchasing hashing power from online mining companies . otherwise you will end up spending more on electricity then the total value of coins mined
