Every time a post from this sub (shitpost or not) hit's I ask the same question, and still haven't gotten an actual answer yet. 
If the currency has no real backing, how do you prevent massive dips and spikes in the value?
Is there anything to stop a chain reaction of people getting nervous and selling off the bitcoin causing the price to go down, which causes more nervousness and a further decrease in price? So on and so forth? 
And even if the currency recovers after that happens, isn't that still terrible? A totally unpredictable and unstable currency with huge potential swings in value? Seems far-fetched.

Dollars have backing from whatever country they are from. The value of american dollars is effectively tied to the american economy and government. Unless you believe that the entire economy will utterly collapse, then the american dollar will always have value. And yeah, during times of economic crisis the dollar goes down, but it never collapses. And as long as the country and government stay intact, it will always rebound. Dollars aren't perfect, but they are **incredibly** stable relative to most other currencies. 


I'm not on the gold-train. Gold is over-valued when compared to it's industrial uses. It's value comes from style and fashion, which so far in almost all of human history has held strong. And although it's been valuable for those characteristics virtually forever, I don't put much stock in that. I agree gold isn't the answer. 


Ok so this is pretty nonsensical. We're talking about the value of the currency, not taxes. The value of the american dollar comes from the fact that the U.S. government recognizes it as currency, it can be used to buy virtually any product or service in america, and because of that other governments and banks will willingly exchange other forms of currency for american dollars. This has absolutely nothing to do with taxes. American dollars still hold value even if you don't live in america. (Same goes for any other dollar).


I agree. The value comes from the money being usable. But that will always hold true as long as the given country stays intact. Canadian dollars for example, will always have value as long as Canada exists and the government recognizes them. I don't believe for a second that Canada is going to dissolve into ruin, therefore I have confidence in the currency of Canada. My confidence in the currency comes from my confidence that the countries and governments themselves are relatively stable. 
I would put less stock in certain currencies based on these factors. I'm not a foreign political expert, but I'd say South Korea is in much greater threat of catastrophe than Canada is (Due to N.K.), so I'd put relatively less stock in their currency. 


I don't put much stock in gold. So I agree, but it's sort of irrelevant. 


Here's where you're mistaken. When you buy bitcoin you're putting that power in the hands of **everyone**. Do you trust the collective populous to make rationale long-term economic decisions? Because I don't. I trust experts. I trust established governments that have been operating successfully for literally hundreds of years.


Sure but "less nervous" from what? If I think there's an X% chance of a chain reaction of panic-sellers causing a huge crash, and you tell me that the more money flowing in decreases to an X-N% chance, it's not really useful. I'm not claiming to know or even have a guess as to what those percentages might be, but I believe that they are dramatically more likely than entire countries or governments collapsing and crashing the dollars. 


Like what? Some examples of what you mean would be good. Cause I honestly have no idea what you're talking about here.
Also as a last note of sorts, who's to say that bitcoin "wins" in the end? There's tons of different crypto currencies that exist now. If everybody waits for a "winner" before they buy in, then none of them will ever get off the ground. But if people do buy in early, and that particular crypto currency loses out to a competitor, all of those people get screwed. Crypto currencies can pop up willy-nilly forever, and every time a new one pops up and gains some traction, old one's will crash. You'd have to be able to somehow prevent competition between the currencies in order to maintain stability.

Because it's tied to the U.S. government and economy. 
The economy has to go through a major crisis in order for the currency to crash, and even in that case the crash is temporary.

This is wrong.

To be honest, it sorta does make sense to trust a giant chain over a local place in that sense. 
A giant chain has A LOT to lose if they fuck up a vegan pizza due to allergy or religious reasons or something, they take that shit pretty seriously. The lawsuit would be enormous and the publicity would cost millions at least.
I would imagine a local place not caring as much or not paying as much attention to those things.

I asked what happens when it reaches the supposed 21 million limit and there's no answers. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:41:32


Yeah well who is "they" ??? 
This is the crux if the issue. Bitcoin is supposed to be this magical decentralized currency but it fundamentally can't be. 
Excuse me for not buying into the magic of bitcoin when fucking none of it holds up to any form of scrutiny.
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:48:20
Ok and what happens when it hits the limit? No more bitcoins forever? They're just done? 
"Ok guys wrap it up, no more bitcoins ever again they're done now. We'll just keep recirculating what we have." 
This sounds fucking terrible. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 01:12:20
No offense. But I'm looking for answers to fairly simple questions, not a trillion hours of reading.
What happens when the limit is reached,  and who is even in charge of limit? Why did they choose 21 million? Can you be sure the limit is absolute and wont be raised? 
Why should i trust a currency with no backing whatsoever. If the only thing backing bitcoin is other people choosing to use it, the moment a decline starts the value just freefalls.
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:45:30
Cool but that's not the argument these bitcoin enthusiasts use. Instead they argue that it's *better* than any other currency, which is horseshit. 
Believe it or not I think it's **WAY** more likely that bitcoin collapses than the entire U.S. Government collapses. 
There's no reason for anyone in the civilized world to use bitcoins other than hiding their transactions from the government/banks. If  you care about privacy in your transactions then more power to ya, but I for one don't give a fuck if my bank knows which stores I shop at. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 05:05:36
I don't understand what any of that means.
