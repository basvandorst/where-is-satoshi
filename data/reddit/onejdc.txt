I think you're comparing apples to oranges.  One is a fledgling currency, the other an institution.
Banks could start holding people's btc wallets just like they hold cash. I'm not saying it's a good idea but there's nothing stopping them.
The better question is: "What can banks do with most conventional currencies (USD, Euro, etc) that they can't do with BTC ?"

technically no, functionally yes.
Bitcoin is, by definition, a currency.  Because of the way that it has been implemented (peer 2 peer), it lacks a central governing authority.  For this reason, things like federal interest rates on the bitcoin can't be set, thus no central lending. However, there really isn't anything stopping you from setting up a receiving address to 'hold' bitcoins for people and charge them interest, effectively creating your own bank.
As for it being a commodity, yes, it currently is. The value of a commodity is driven by the want or need of the resource by the people, coupled with commodity availability.  In this is Bitcoin's largest challenge: user buy-in to show that it is, in fact, something people need or want.  It's gaining a lot of traction.  With banks, such as the US Federal Reserve, the currency which they deal in isn't based on anything (see fiat currency), so the value is much more arbitrary and is set by said central authority, not actually by the people. In this way, Bitcoin is very different -- it's a much more social currency.
