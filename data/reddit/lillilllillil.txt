There will be no kill. Just slow assimilation.

An exchange at the airport is free to charge this "extortionate" fee as it is meant to be for the person who will need it there and then. Similar to how you need to pay a bitcoin fee when doing a transaction to have it done faster.

Not possible to do this on the market. If it was the coins would not be crashing as hard right now due to bets against it causing a surge in volume of trading.

What happened to the crowd funded documentary about the couple who wanted to go a year using only bitcoin?

Those people had fair warning as there was ample evidence showing insider bot trading to artificially inflate the price and demand along with unanswered questions for months on financials.

Sad to see money gone in an instant but this shows that the regular population can not safely use bitcoin unless they understand computers. This tech will never be mass used if the average Joe goes online and loses his $300 for visiting a website without an anti-virus.

I'm just going to chime in and say that with current market rates and trends we will not reach a price of $1 per terabyte of storage by 2020. $20-$40 most likely.

Buying may seem like an idea but you have to consider the hoarders who will be buying the bitcoin to not use but hold onto like a common stock. This was not the original intention of the new currency. If people begin to hoard and not use or trade them like they are now there will be trouble ahead.
