What exactly doesn't make sense for you?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:38:20
Man, we all want it so bad
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:49:39
It's obvious for anyone long enough here. Antpool/ViaBTC/Bitcoin.com/BTC.top is all just Bitmain avatars
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:02:19
Chinese fellows don't agree to surrender. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:10:00
2,225 users are here now, because it should happen fucking now  
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:53:11
What if the decision will be published on Monday as some media predict? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:31:53
Exactly, this is the real problem bitcoin is here to solve. It was never a problem to buy a coffee, nothing to solve here. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:37:57
It's misconception. How do you think proof-of-stake work with no miners at all? 
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:34:13
It is supported only by Bitmain, but unfortunately Bitmain is the main producer of miner hardware. The reason is very simple - segwit will negatively impact their transaction fee revenue.

It will be here:

They don't promote this fact for obvious reasons. Try to dig a bit and check some photos and quotes. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:56:35
Really dump
@_date: 2017-03-08 10:18:43
We need SR-BatsBZX-2016-30, and this is 2016-80
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:42:46
It shouldn't be a problem to fundraise to support this long-awaited initiative. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:27:21
All cryptonote altcoins live without  China threat and work perfect. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:32:53
Please explain, why miners don't want BTC to increase in value?
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:29:05
Many fellow bitcoiners don't understand that the approval of this ETF will be a life time opportunity and a game changer.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:07:24
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:06:30
It will appear here
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:59:05
good one

Do you use technology of wheel? Flight? Electricity? Will flight be replaced with teleportation? May be. 
Will cryptocurrency be here in 100 years? No doubts. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:58:41
Rolling on the floor laughing, at least few governments will adopt Bitcoin as a national currency by ~2030. Calling it now!
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:54:32
It seems many people do the same now. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:49:19
Incorrect. It's not just another "currency", it is a technology. Once invented it will be with us forever. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:37:32
Thank you!

US, Swiss, Japan?
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:13:51
Pretty liberal and no plans to ban crypto exchanges
