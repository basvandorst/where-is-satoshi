lol you obviously do not understand the markets
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:22:25
havent they been saying that since february ? While obviously the market was going down ? I've been trading 10 years, yet it is the first time I see market participants get so emotionally involved, only that was a sign in that the cycle was coming to an end. I do not think we have seen the lows.
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:14:57
Seems like the ones going long are giving their money to me lol
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:31:32
One can only laugh reading this nonsense
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:24:31
my thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2018-09-17 13:26:10
have been, quite a few times already and added to stash of BTC this way........In a bear market you short !
@_date: 2018-09-19 03:23:00
lol, yeah right. I retired at 36 and started trading, must have done something right.
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:21:24
dressed in black RIP will be suitable I suppose 
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:22:15
time to short this bitch again than :)
@_date: 2018-05-09 02:14:02
great.......so thy can start manipulating this market as well........!!
@_date: 2018-05-22 00:52:11
No, it is consolidating..............
@_date: 2018-05-22 01:20:39
the bull is a shape shifter.......
@_date: 2018-10-07 03:54:29
no, you will probably buy be able to buy it cheaper. If you really can't wait don't go in 100%, divide it up. Quite sure lower prices are coming soon.
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:12:50
likewise mate ;)
@_date: 2018-10-07 04:09:45
dude....Really !!
@_date: 2018-06-03 02:23:22
Fully agreed, big players will continue to manipulate prices.......Sorry to break the party but moon was last year, most are late to the party as usual......:)
@_date: 2018-06-03 02:21:41
same here........we haven't seen the lows yet........
@_date: 2018-06-10 06:44:54
hahahha dream on, the guys sold last december are driving the lambos, rest is holding their bags ;)
@_date: 2018-06-10 06:54:31
THe first generation of hodlers have long sold and are enjoying life with $$, since that is what is being used in real life.........second generation of hodlers are in for a long hodl.....
Then you got us traders who go long/short and for the last couple of months shorting has paid out very well....
The whole market scene is very different from last year.
Now for weak hands and hodling.........why the fuck would you want to hodl something if you can just sell it and buy it back way cheaper.......not weak hands but smart hands......
If an asset class is bearish, trending down, you short it,......Bitcoin has been bearish for months so short the mofu........
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:16:08
fully agreed, last year's prices were nothing else then whales manipulating the market, BTC is going back to its real value of 0.0....
I'm still shorting this mofu, adding to a stash of soon to be worthless BTC.....
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:16:11
with ya on the short train, have been for awhile now........if trend is bearish traders short the market.......not rocket science but it seems many are in denial ;)
@_date: 2018-06-03 02:25:17
dude, in real life there are still very few use cases.....yeah yeah sure you can look long enough till you find some merchant accepting btc but talking convenience while booking, travelling and so on.........No it is far from ! 
@_date: 2018-06-03 02:28:33
When "experts" are saying this, you can bet we're going to go down, load up on the shorts again.
@_date: 2018-06-03 03:00:46
still very limited, one would expected a lot more after all this hype of last year........it is what it is, an over hyped phenomena......with so far little to show far, except from blatant market manipulation.......
Just expedia.....it doesn't accept BTC when booking flights in asia !! Long way to go before all of this will have a real use case.
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:20:44
Right on. Can't believe you still have people believing these markets are not manipulated !
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:56:32
no atm fees, yet higher transaction fees, not to mention how slow........not a good move ! BTC is not usable for consumers !
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:53:12
more like the bitcoin crowd are bitches......Annoying slow and expensive transactions.....useless really ! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:06:02
sure they are. And do not get me wrong I'm not a anti Bitcoin dude. Just a consumer that chooses the consumer convenient choice ! So for me that is Dash and Bcash and Ltc but I see Ltc as just being the little sick brother of BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:45:28
good stuff
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:49:40
Well that is my 45 day experience......using btc.....not a good one.....started using dash, lots faster and cheaper. Actually started using it last June and it only has gone downhill from there......Just my opinion as a user "trying" to use it......Nah, it is just not user friendly anymore......Dash is what BTC should be......fast, cheap, easy to use = consumer friendly. I know that there is much more behind the BTC/BCH saga but it just shows that both parties are serving self interest and their own egos yet the ones suffering here are the end users in BTC's case......
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:34:55
euh...no it isn't.....
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:14:32
great article
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:10:43
hahhaha, you have no idea.....Dad ! 
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:40:10
hahahhaha, dude........would love to play longer but I gotta go now......chill out bro......oh wait......I'm waiting for another confirmation.....help oh wise one.....
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:16:19
not saying that, just saying that their transactions are as good as instant.......which cannot be said from BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:23:16

@_date: 2017-10-27 16:03:35
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:04:57
anyway, making a transfer from bank A to bank B is instant where we live here......immediate access to your money which is what most consumers want ! Waiting 6+ hours for confirmation just doesn't do it ! 
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:55:56
and.....Dash payments, LTC and ETH payments arrive as good as immediately to my wallet. So for me BTC as store value yes, but obviously not suitable as swift payment method. I am allowed to have my own opinion am I ?
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:45:50
You obviously dont do sarcasm very well......just see the truth......your precious btc is NOT suitable for fast payments.......store value it is but to be used as payment method it is not........The sooner you understand that the quicker they will release you from the mental institute you find yourself presently at.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:12:38
The planet will destroy itself as it part of its cycle.
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:36:00
hahahaha dude....go and fuck yourself already.....you budded in coz I was asking a question to which others have given me answer. 
So get off your high BTC horse and just see it the way it is.......BTC transactions are slow compared to some other crypto currencies.....
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:42:19
euhh yes dad......I'm sure every consumer wants fast transactions if not it is not usable......With slow transactions like this it cannot be used as a method of payment.....Just takes too long....
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:15:36
Dude......go and do something already....lol.....you are obviously bored....
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:56:43
and...6 out of 6
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:05:20
Just using what is most convenient to me as a consumer........Dad!!....
@_date: 2018-07-11 02:00:11
Right, Nigerians pulling 419's is exactly what this space needs to betaken seriously........hahah
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:40:15
I surely hope so....preferably in the nearby future....Thx
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:17:00
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:33:09
Euhh, you seem to be the one insulting others because they do not believe in your philosophy whatever that might be......Highly educated you must be....."bitch" ! You seem to have a hard on for this whole confirmation issue.....In the mean time the BTC have been received and spent...maybe you should do the same instead of calling people names and harping on about it.....Enjoy your weekend, have a beer a joint or whatever seems like you need it.
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:37:42
hahhahahahah, you are the one crying here, I'm laughing my ass off with guys like you protecting a inferior payment product. ;)
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:53:21
it was 0.046 :) Anyway, it is obviously to store and sell at higher prices but not suitable as payment method
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:56:00
Yes dad!! Enjoy your Saturday, don't get all grumpy on mom now......
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:21:37
And....ok...3/6 confirmations...
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:18:36
No idea.....but I want my btc now.....4 hours..!!  Seriously anybody know why this takes so long..... Like this BTC can obviously not be conveniently used as a payment method..
