Wow nice, congratulations to the winner, I thought I was kind of close but we'll see :)
I found out that the dates were made of the year of the oscar attribution and the day/month of the actor's birthday who got the award. I got the full list of actor names but was stuck there. Impatient to know the solution now :)

I see that we share a lot of the reasoning :) I've spent so many hours on this and the last hint just made me spend even more.. My Python script has grown to 300 lines and derivates all sorts of apparently useless data from the pairs.. At this time I am pretty much convinced an external data source is necessary and that it will not be found anytime soon.
I will patiently wait for the next hint and take a break.

My theory is a little different :) I think that originally the hint was supposed to be an obvious one (OP said that it would definitely put an end to the puzzle) but decided to add complexity on top of it. I think that behind these 26 words is a pointer to an external source (I think the puzzle isn't self-sufficient).
So far I've noticed that all alphabet letters are represented, so I thought maybe trying to assign each word to a letter (which the word contains) might give them an order that would make more sense. Unfortunately, there are over 500k possible assignment, so probably a dead end. Also, the words `oax` and `aluminium` make me think that the words were written manually by OP (crypto exchange + British spelling? + inconsistent spacing between words) and not through a script. So I think that the answer doesn't lie in a character-by-character analysis.
TL;DR: No clue :)

The last hint is another puzzle in itself except you don't even know what you are looking for... I feel like it actually adds in complexity...

Oh sorry, you actually mentioned that idea above. But I agree it becomes a little far fetched to extract 2 bits from that much. Well, the end of the month is coming so we should soon know how close we all came..

To add to your contribution, here is another approach that I haven't seen mentioned yet: I've read the BIP39 spec and learned that the 12 words are actually 12 numbers represented by 11 bits each (so in total 132 bits, 128 of entropy and 4 of checksum). Now if one number-date pair encoded 2 bits, you would needs 66 pairs to represent all words. For the beta puzzle, you would need 61 pairs. That looks pretty close... I haven't fully investigated that route yet though.

I investigated this but that didn't lead anywhere. I computed date differences (absolute and in days) with the dates pair-wise and tried to make sense of the numbers by using modulos and adding up digits. The letters I got didn't make any sense.
I also noticed that when counting the occurrences of the single numbers (1 to 14) and sorting them, we obtain 995755663. This is the timestamp corresponding to 22nd of July 2001. I did the same thing above but by subtracting this date from all dates, but same...

Thanks for the explanation! One detail out of curiosity, in order to find the letter at the given index in the actor name  you must have had to normalize the actor names, how did you do that? What I did was to concatenate`firstname + lastname` by removing all spaces and dashes and then accessing the character at `index - 1`. Was it the correct way?
