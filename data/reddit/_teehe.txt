Most people posses under 1000$ worth in cryptocurrency. So, this limit makes that people are sure and serious about their investment.
Investing in this IPO is no risk, if IPO fails you get refund. If it goes well, you have probably doubled your money.

Sir, how did you get to that conclusion?
@_date: 2015-03-29 00:07:06


Exactly. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-03-11 20:35:16
I understand.
However, thank you for your support. If you can spread the word, we would be grateful.

Teehe will also be Bitcoin operator, you can use Teehe with Bitcoin too. Read our papers, you will see what are we aiming at. We only want to eliminate volatility of Bitcoin to make gambling easier. However, that is only part of what we have to offer; we will offer prestige security and anonymity to our customers as well as outstanding visual appearance of the platform.

Minimum investment is 500$, you must understand us. We want serious investors after all, and this limit should help.
I hope BTC price will stabilize above 300$ so more people can partner with us.
Thank you for your support.

I am preparing for same setting. But I want it to be perfect, standard system that users can rely on for safeguarding their coins. Much like those "cold wallet" solutions for Bitcoin.


I say if it can be done to be safe by design, that it should be safe by design.
Especially if this devices are to be distributed - you should invest some effort beside UI.

It is not over-engineered. People expect that their coins are safe, and some people have significant amount of USD worth in coins they stake. You can not just tell them, ok use this and it will be alright. What if they are hacked, who will be responsible?
Ok, it is possible that Peerbox is aimed at different market but my end goal is to have bulletproof platform for staking coins - like safe but that can participate on the network by staking.

It does not mean that Teehe will only use Namecoin DNS. It will be also avaliable as classic website. Namecoin and Tor are just safety nets.

What you try to sell now, I work on for almost a year and I am not near completion. I am one man show with this but it is still slow.
What I did is to first handle the OS, so it is secure and hardened as possible - then I will implement the Web UI. 
What I did is to take ArchLinux ARM and strip it down, compile everything with hardened toolchain and place in my own repository - effectively forking the distro. I have also got Grsecurity patch working on Raspberry Pi kernel (first to do this) with help from Grsec author. Peerbox kernel features unparalleled security, the kind you find on very important servers.
Disabled swap, auto configuration of firewall upon first boot, 2FA authentication for SSH, etc... And there is still a ton of work to do.
I am sorry to break it for you, but your product looks unprofessional and prematurely released. You should have started from the bottom not from top. You might expect some sales with altcoin people but I sincerely doubt that people from Peercoin community will adopt it.

Where from device?
@_date: 2015-03-11 14:35:26
One of our members who is in charge of IPO funds is well know and reputable member of Peercoin/NuBits community. He is personally staking this reputation to ease minds of investors. 
Is there anything else you want to know, that might ease your mind.

[Peerbox]( author here.
I've seen your paper and I do not understand what is the benefit of buying this device from you. As is seems, you have taken of-the-shelf Ubuntu installation and build a Web based UI for it. 
I have several questions:
* Did you implement any hardening for underlying OS? 
* Are the coin daemons properly isolated and sanboxed? 
* Do you compile binaries of the coin daemons on your own, if so can you guarantee quality of binaries.
* How is your Web UI implemented and how does it communicate with coin daemons? 
* Do you offer auto-detection of device IP or user has to figure it out on his own? 
* Is communication between device and Web UI secured, if so how?
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:21:13
* Is communication between device and Web UI secured, if so how?
What I meant is, do you use https/ssl.
Beside password, do you use any other security measures to secure Web UI?


Do you make Ubuntu .deb packages or just use binaries?
As for hardening of the OS.


That is not hardening. Hardening is reducing kernel attack surface, disabling swap, using disk encryption and compiling entire OS with hardened toolchain. You can find examples here: 


What I mean by that is coin daemon detached from the system, so compromised system can not affect daemon and that infected daemon can not hard the rest of the system.
On Peerbox every daemon is totally separated from the rest of the OS utilizing classic unix security (different user, permission) as well as namespace isolation via systemd.
All of this is imperative if you expect people to keep their money on such device.
* Also, what about firewall? How did you handle it?
