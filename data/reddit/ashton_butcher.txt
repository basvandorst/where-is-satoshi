I love doge and I'm about 50/50 in each but frankly it's pretty embarrassing when I see people doing that on other subreddits and then acting like anyone who doesn't enjoy it is just jealous or spiteful.

The idea is that the free market will sort out bugs like this because if btc-e steals money from a bunch of people, then other people will smarten up and stop using them, and they'll get naturally de-selected, so to speak. Of course, a bunch of people have to get screwed over first before a business develops a reputation like that.
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:05:31
It's useful in that it solves the problem of trust between the buyer and seller. It doesn't solve the problem of trusting the escrow. There is always a degree of trust involved in using an escrow.

Look at a banana. Now make a ring with your thumb and index finger. Notice anything? "Satoshi" kept himself "anonymous" because he is actually the Illuminati. The developers currently doing the most work on bitcoin are themselves sleeper agents completely unaware of their true identities who will activate and begin instituting NEW WORLD ORDER (NWO) when they hear the secret phrase. Every time I bring these issues up with bitcoiners they get totally evasive, so lets hear what you have to say about it.

I have an apple tv which I use for netflix. It is connected to my TV by an hdmi cable.
One day I thought, hey, I can use this same hdmi cable to plug my computer into the TV! Just like, you know, any hdmi cable!
But it turned out that it actually wouldn't work. I would plug it in any my computer wouldn't show up on the TV. So just to try and see what was wrong, I asked my roommate to bring her macbook air in the room, and when I plugged that one in, it fucking worked!
Apple literally sold me a normal looking hdmi cable that ONLY works with their products.
Fuck you apple.

I think the way the terms are usually thrown about, they're geeks. A geek is someone who's extremely passionate about something that isn't widely popular, like Star Trek, or Wow. A "nerd" is someone who is a geek about something with an academic bent, like chemistry or computer programming. A "dork" is someone with the interpersonal and hygiene skills of a geek, but without the redeeming quality of having become exceedingly proficient at at least one thing.
Also if I recall correctly from grade school, one or all of these terms actually means "whale penis."

I think it comes as off as unthoughtful since, as great as bitcoin is and as much as you really want to share it with people, at the same time you're trying to get people to participate in this investment scheme that you're already in on. Of course there is more to it than that, but it's how a lot of people would interpret it and they're not entirely wrong.
On the other hand, I was in the grocery store the other day and an ad for Western Union came on over the speakers. It said something like "Give the gift of money! Everyone loves money! Send someone you love the gift of fifty dollars, through Western Union, for a fee of only five dollars!" Swear to god I am not making that up. 
I think a possible compromise could be, perhaps, give someone bitcoin and then explain to them how to cash it out right away, and be like, "Here, I got you some money, you can take it right now and if you're curious, I'll tell you more about this bitcoin thing." It would depend on who the gift is for. And I don't even know if it's possible to sell bitcoins easily without linking a bank account? But it's an idea anyway.

So essentially, it's a computational problem that's formulated from the transactions that occur.
So, I'm guessing that the very first block was like, the trivial case, and the first batch popped out pretty easily?
Now this probably a silly question, but just hypothetically, what if for one reason or another there were no transactions taking place for a while? Would it be impossible to mine? Or easier?

Exponential growth is the simplest growth model after linear. The next simplest, if you want, is called logistic growth, and it looks like this:
What you see here is an initial period of exponential growth which changes at the inflection point to asymptotically leveling off towards the final value.
The bitcoin graph will eventually look like something like this but drawn by a person with really shaky hands, except for the end.

Well I can give you one tip, no one appreciates being corrected on tedious shit like that. Sometimes it's okay just to respond to what you know someone is trying to say. And don't be so down on yourself; you don't need "redeeming qualities," you are awesome because you're a unique human being, everything else is just icing on the cake.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:53:47
NO. no. get out. get out right now.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:26:55
This is what people mean when they say r/bitcoin is a circle jerk. Major developments in bitcoin are happening every few months or even weeks, but there are people here every day who want encouragement so minor developments which are positive get maximum exposure.
Note the phrase *maximum* exposure. Reddit has an algorithm for determining what stays on the front page and for how long. When a link gets a lot of votes and comments it gets pushed back to make room for new material. 
So when a major development gets posted, it simply can't be there for longer. When a link gets like, a whole crapton of votes and comments then it will stay around extra long, but I don't think r/bitcoin is big enough for that to happen.
And especially when people don't really know what to *think* of the news, when the last China thing happened there were so many posts the next few days about how good or how bad the news was.
People on r/bitcoin mainly just want a reason to stay excited. If you have money ready to buy with and you come here, chances are you're going to see something positive news blown way out of proportion and be like "holy shit I need to buy before the price jumps." This will happen every time you come on here except right after something truly bad happens. If you want to know real goings-on check out r/bitcoinmarkets

Pump and dumps are just greedy people trying to scam other greedy people. If you got scammed in one, it's because you were being greedy.


Haha, I wonder if you would be complaining if you had actually made money off of the thing. You do know that money doesn't come out of thin air, right? Someone, somewhere, has to be losing in order for you to gain. But since you were the one who lost, fontas deserves to burn in hell. Nice one.

It is pretty rare for a new technology to come along without also raising some serious ethical questions. Hundreds of people die in car crashes every day. The internet changed the way we do business, and it also changed how people share child porn. But over time, cars have gotten safer and things like facial recognition software have helped catch pedophiles who might not have been caught before. New problems force us to create new solutions. That's the nature of progress.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:51:20
This is a completely expected move from China. The Chinese government wants to keep wealth within their borders, and bitcoin allows people to send it overseas as easily as sending an email. 
"Good" or "bad" is a matter of subjectivity, the people who are delusional are the ones acting like this is any kind of a surprise.

Doesn't mean it *will* fail though, at least not as long as the dollar is around. 
If they can provide the convenience that bitcoin offers, such as sending money anywhere instantly, even for a small fee, without the decentralization...this could be bad.

Why would you want cash? Why would you want a credit card? 
Why would you want a checkbook? 
I'm not implying that bitcoin is way better than all of these. The point is that money in different forms has relative merits. Paper money is good because you can hand it to someone. It is one of the few remaining ways to make a purchase without electricity. It's also good because you can spend it anonymously. It's not so good because it's hard to send far away, and it's easy to steal. 
Credit cards are good because they let you pay for things quickly and easily. They're good for buying things from far away because you can pay electronically. They're good because if they get stolen your money is mostly protected. They're bad because everything you pay for is recorded. They're bad because the credit card company can decide if they don't want you to send money somewhere. And if none of THAT bothers you... they take a profit from you.
How does bitcoin compare? It's easy to pay with and keep track of like a credit card, it's as anonymous as cash if you really want it to be, you can send it anywhere in the world instantly, and *no one is nickel-and-diming you or telling you what to do with your money.* The only real downside as I see it is that you have to be a bit more proactive about keeping your money safe. But like I said, relative merits.

He has some real points. Bitcoin is a completely new experiment and no one knows for sure if it's going to work or not. I have a pretty strong feeling that it is, and I also have some money to burn. But it's entirely possible they could become worthless. Don't gamble with anything you can't afford to lose.

@_date: 2013-12-11 22:11:20
That's an interesting question. The obvious answer is just to call the prison and ask, if they say no and you want to look into it more, cross that bridge when you come to it. 
But it makes me wonder if this is something that might change in the future as an indirect result of the way bitcoin gets regulated, if it does.
In that case, if your friend is in for a long stay, who knows, maybe its okay now but later they get banned, and that makes them extra valuable on the inside. I have no idea if that's how things would work, but it seems like a possibility. 
Of course prisoners would need a way to check the account. I've tried to think of a logistical way of sending bitcoins to people in developing countries, and this seems to run into the same problem.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:47:31

The question to me is more like, for all the 19 year old pothead computer geeks sitting on a few hundred or a few thousand coin...these are going to be the richest people in world? It's not that I think it's a *bad* thing necessarily, I trust they would make good use of it, it's just...
Some people get rich by being lucky, but the locus of global wealth and power doesn't just change hands like that, slipping like sand through the clutching fingers of the old rich, and into the cupped palms of people like me. It's a fantasy. 
It just seems extremely ego-masturbatory to think that, what, the power elite have built this corrupt empire on fiat currency and we're going to destroy it and inherit all the riches just by being slightly ahead of the curve?
Seriously, if the predictions that bitcoin will eventually be a million a pop are worth any salt at all, and the fact that there are a decent number of people under 20 sitting on upwards of a thousand of them a piece...do the math.
And how about this guy Fontas? Everyone complains about him being such a huge fucking asshole scumbag, but if *our* wildest dreams come true he is apparently going to be the next Warren Buffet!

It shouldn't be that hard. The company would never get off the ground if the founders don't make themselves accountable to the public from the beginning. Then, the only technical difficulty is where do they actually get the money to pay people back? The answer, I think, is to offer some small long term incentive to early investors, and have them agree to small/zero insurance in the beginning with the amount that they're covered for increasing over time.
FDIC only insures you for up to $100,000 anyways.

Honestly, I imagine it would be quite easy to launder money through an exchange. Buy some currency and sell it to another account at a higher price. Maybe someone who knows more about white collar crime can tell me why I'm wrong.
And before anyone makes the argument that banks like Wells Fargo have been heavily implicated in money laundering, let's be honest, that may be true but it won't be enough to convince any government to keep their hands off the exchanges.

This is true, but people may be willing to compromise on some of the luxuries of bitcoin in exchange for having their money insured, and for not having to keep track of it themselves. This could be a legitimate threat, we shouldn't brush it off.

Your bank holds money for you, right? So if you hold the money yourself, you are the bank.
The difference is that having lots of cash on hand is unsafe, for well known reasons. So a bank helps you out by keeping your money safe for you. If a bank gets robbed, they swallow the losses and still give you your money back. With bitcoin this role is a bit superfluous, because there's no increased difficulty in storing, say, a dollar in bitcoin vs. a dollar. There's also no increased difficulty in *stealing* a dollar vs. a million dollars (in bitcoins) so as far as getting robbed for your private keys, well, that is a potential drawback. On the other hand, if you want to be super careful you could print your private keys and store them somewhere where even YOU don't have easy access to them...which is essentially the point of putting your money in a savings account.
Another point worth mentioning is that your bank pays you some interest for letting them loan your money out while they're keeping it. If they didn't, your money would gradually lose value and that would discourage people from saving. With bitcoin, since there are only a finite amount ever being made, the value will (eventually) always increase slightly when you hold on to it.

No doubt about that. Fortunately it was only the $20 I had still on coinbase, most of my holdings are still in cold storage. I figured best case, I make three or four bucks, worst case, I can take credit for halting the crash and saving everyone else's money.

The people who are threatened by bitcoin probably don't care so much if they eradicate completely so much as they just don't want it pissing in their yard.
If they pass laws that severely impede mainstream adoption, bitcoin could die off. It would still exist, but the value is only going to keep rising if it's useful to buy things with. The fact that it's still possible to use it doesn't matter. What matters is whether or not people want to. 
If the only people who use it are online black marketers, there will be plenty of bitcoins around to satisfy all of them. The value will plummet. 
Then, even if you insist that the rise of a digitial decentralized currency is inevitable, a lull of a couple years could be enough time for another cryptocoin to supplant bitcoin. And you can argue that this would be better in the long run, but still, all your precious bitcoin that you have saved up now would be worthless.

First of all, you should have a look at this: 
My facebook comment was really in reference to one or two of them, and I was going to point them out and say you should pay attention to it while you're reading but then I started reading that list and realized there's a whole slew of them that can apply. 
Anyways, the point is that when you read it's full of smart people who understand bitcoin and like it because it's a good idea. So you probably think that a majority of rational people will pick up on it simply because it's a good idea.
However, it's lucky for you that you don't read facebook because if you did, you would probably come away a bit disillusioned. 
You would probably come away with the conclusion that bitcoin isn't worth investing in simply because people are WAY, WAAAAAAY too stupid to ever be able to use it properly.
And maybe that's not really the case either. The reality is probably somewhere in the middle. My point in bringing up cognitive biases is to point out that getting your news from a place like reddit kind of skews your perception about what *most people* are really thinking, honestly in much the same way that watching Fox News all the time would.
So it's important to base your predictions for the future on a multitude of sources, and not just a forum of like-minded individuals, but honestly I recommend you don't look on facebook, because seriously, it's bad.

Let me know when you do, we'll get some insider trading action going.

It was clear, but your question doesn't actually *have anything to do* with bitcoin.
What are you doing right now would be like going on and asking "How do I set up a bitcoin wallet for a Latin project?" Do you think you'll find more Latin-reading people on or @_date: 2013-12-14 15:50:07
2.3 million dollars would get you a whole lot of arcade tokens... 9.2 million I guess.

He's speaking in the past perfect tense, talking about an opinion he used to hold, while also addressing what is still a very common notion of what bitcoin is about.
Playing the victim card when it's really not warranted just makes you seem pathetic.

It's hard to imagine that could every actually happen in America because of the ensuing legal quagmire. We have this process where if a law gets passed and people are kind of iffy on it, then the judicial branch of our government reviews it to see if it's constitutional or not, or at least that's how the process is supposed to work.
If anyone in the government made an earnest move towards banning bitcoin outright, what that is really saying is that, you can come up with these strings of random letters and numbers, but you can't send certain strings letters and numbers back and forth and you certainly can't charge for them because *those* strings of letters and numbers are illegal. In other words, it would become a freedom of speech issue.
What they *could* do, is impose a 75% tax on any transactions conducted in bitcoin, or something like that. What would happen then? Suppose the bitcoin economy ends up really taking hold in China, and the value goes up by another 5000%? Then all of this newly created wealth lands in China, hardly any of it lands in America. This could, conceivably, be more damaging to America than whatever damage bitcoin would do to the dollar if we embraced it right away. So which choice is really better for *America* in the long run? That is one of the questions that members of congress are currently grappling with.

I almost feel sorry for them. Even if bitcoin doesn't live up to any of the rest of the hype, it still makes Western Union completely obsolete. Unless they can reinvent themselves again, I think they are finished.
