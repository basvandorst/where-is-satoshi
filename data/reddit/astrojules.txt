And money lost in crypto must be reported as well?

Can someone explain to me GDAX? I'm pretty interested in beginning to use it. What's the difference between a market, limit, and stop order?

This \^ times 1000. I'm always just messing around with other wallets to see if I like their UI better and features too. I despise the ones with the little quiz to input the words. Like, I'm just testing this out. Pls.
I get why it's there, I just don't always like it.

I have a pretty good grasp of how the Bitcoin blockchain works and with that, I truly believe Bitcoin can eventually become the world's currency. 
Sure, I put some money in it every now and then to scratch that investing itch. But to me, it's more about the technology behind it and what it represents.
No one controls it but you (given you own your keys in your own wallet) and it's freeing you from being tied to any institution.

This is one of my favorite videos. And I think it explains it best, in a way that everyone can understand. I love their other math videos too.

Hi! Okay, so I set up my Unhold account and I also tied to my Brave Creators account, is this correct? So I would "tip" myself the BAT and then it would eventually end up in my Uphold account? Or is there an easier way to do this?

I have a serious question, maybe someone could help me try to understand.
If Bitcoin is to eventually become the world's main currency, and there isn't enough for the richest people to own their wealth in BTC.
 Does this mean BTC will never reach full adoption?
Or does this mean the price of BTC is destined to reach crazy high numbers? 
I know BTC is divisible but it's also scarce, so eventually there just won't be enough because dividing subtracts the value you have, what would be the equivalent of adding value?

If you're asking about how Bitcoin and the block chain work, here is my favorite video explaining it. It's a bit long, but really thorough and easy to understand:

Literally me putting more money in BTC last week ��

How do you transfer BAT out of the Brave Rewards Wallet? I haven't figured out how to do this yet.

The government isn't behind USDC or Tether, but these are tokenizations of the US Dollar, right?
If so, it would interesting to see how the government would go about this and if it could even be done.
@_date: 2019-10-21 15:55:05
Oh okay, that's interesting. The transaction confirmed almost immediately after I posted the first comment. I'll just use the legacy address next time and going forward, thank you!

CB Pro is showing a $.13 fee for me.
Cash app is still showing a $.87 fee, however I did notice that the fee is added on top of the $50 so your BTC purchase is the full $50.
And for Gemini, I'm still seeing $1.99 as well. Do I need to be on Gemini Activer Trader?
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:34:56
Wait I'm confused, lots of people saying they're going to leave CBP. But when I check the fees with a buy of $50 for BTC, the fees are still lower here.
Cash App $50 BTC Buy Fee: $0.87
Gemini $50 BTC Buy Fee: $1.99
Coinbase Pro $50 BTC Buy Fee: $0.13
It still seems cheaper to me to use CBP? I don't plan on making HUGE deposits, just small ones every few weeks / months.
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:24:52
Which platform has the lowest fees? Cash app or Gemini? Just curious which I should use now over Coinbase Pro.

3Blue1Brown - he did a really well explained video. It's a bit long, so maybe you can summarize it yourself. 
This one is my absolute favorite:

This is great! However, the recent release of Android 10 removed Android Beam. ��

Why is it when I send BTC from Coinbase Pro to my BRD Wallet via a Segwit address, and I go to check the transaction on [live.blockcypher.com]( it says the address entered is invalid? I have tried copy/pasting the address and even clicking directly from Coinbase. I always get the BTC in my wallet fine after some time, but I'm just curious as to why this would happen?

My school just opened up a class on Blockchain Technology for the Spring Semester!
@_date: 2019-12-17 06:40:50
I wish I could buy more but I once I did my monthly budget there just wasn't any room for more Bitcoin. Maybe next month!
@_date: 2019-12-25 03:49:27
Thanks for the tip!
I think I have tiny amounts of USDC and XTZ on my Coinbase account still. But it doesn't let me send it because it's too small for the fees. Any advice?
@_date: 2019-12-06 22:26:03
I donated $5 in BTC the other day! ��
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:34:01
Would using a mobile wallet like BRD on Android be a decent solution for this?
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:44:51
This makes sense. But I have a hard time still understanding how this will work later on.
Let's say in the future one BTC is $10, just for easy math.
I'd obviously want to know what it's valuation is that way I can compare to the USD. Oh a shirt for 1 BTC? Perfect.
My rent is 60 BTC? Cool. At what point when BTC is widely used will we be able to use it without referring to it's value in another currency?
