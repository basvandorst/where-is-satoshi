Congrats OP, I looked into BTC back in 2012, shame I didn't buy back then. Better late then never.

Finally! A strong fucking meme to get us through this shitstorm. My fellow HODLERS STAY STRONG, UNITED WE STAND DIVIDED WE FALL.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:50:58
I love these stories man! EPIC! Congrats OP!

You could've used ShapeShift to convert the BCash to BTC.

1. Set up an appointment with the Bank stating you wish to close your account.
2. Get a duffel bag, also wear a suit, preferably not orange.
3. Withdraw all the moneys.
4. Stack it up in your garage and ask your partner "What's my name", to which they reply "You're Heisenberg", lastly with a grin on your face you turn towards them and say "You're god damn right!".

Aye you're heading was proper misleading! You got me Sir, you got me good!
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:20:23
Wish someone gave me 1 BTC.....��
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:51:53
Congrats Sir! This is exactly my dream, unfortunately I only just got in the game at the dip back in October this year. I knew about Cryptocurrency back in 2012 but didn't do anything about it. Damn you past me!

Just imagine if he just comes out and reveals himself as the Real Satoshi! And that he rewards the system by doubling the reward.....*tears*
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:26:26
Strong is this meme. Increase, BTC price will!
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:37:25
I sleep soundly at night knowing full well what goes up must go down and what goes down must go up. More importantly I salute to the folks who invested since '09 those guys are the real MVPs! *Fist bump*
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:34:49
Sound advice for the fellow HODLers! Definitely agree on point 2, I saw the same thing happen in the early hours of the morning for the attack on BTC over BCH. Unless you already have your money loaded onto the exchange and you're quick on the trigger, even then it's high risk to chancing it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:04:38
OP! You're a legend! Sending good karma to you my friend :p
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:28:50

@_date: 2017-12-10 10:33:04
Aye I sense the sarcasm in OPs post! The Dark side will meet the light cometh Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:23:38
So that's how it started......Years from now people will ask what did you do when BTC  was dumping, we'll just say to them we stood there and HODL'd.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:15:43
Poor guy is gonna need to look over his shoulder for this guy...
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:23:32
YES YES Let the HODL flow through you! The HODL is strong with this one....
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:11:47
I'm so sorry for your loss bro. I know this may not mean much but the people that stole his BTCs there will be hell to pay for, in this life or the next.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:56:32
Merry Christmas Ya Filthy Animal. And keep the change!
Congrats OP I love hearing how BTC changes people's lives here! Awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:58:45
God damn, that look beautiful! *wipes tears*
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:26:03
This! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:09:18
I was wondering are there other Cryptos on the same Mempool alongside BTC? Its weird how the price goes down for the others at the same time --&gt; LTC/ETH
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:35:03
We sure started something at work here too. Now we can't stop talking about the price and the future and how we're gonna use it. What a time to be alive!
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:52:44
Well done dude! I myself can afford 1 BTC but decided to buy small just before the S2X fork but seeing as it just went tits up and I'm running to the bank asap! Anyone know of any good low level fees for purchasing via GBP currency? Had a look at Coinfloor but its quite extortionate!
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:41:49
Holy shit! It's happened! Congrats everyone! B2X lacked big-time and finally people see right through it. Can't beleive my eyes when I saw Bitcoin creeping past the 6K mark!!!  (GBP).
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:13:21
I've signed up to Revolut, did you make a transfer from your bank to Revolut in GBP or Euro? When I choose Euro it says my bank might charge me for the conversion....
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:18:48
Thanks Bro! I'm glad to say I've jumped onto the wagon, a little late to the party but I feel much more confident with the market and how its going. After much deliberation I've decided to see where my investment may take me. It's time to HODL! (Did I say it right? XD )

You should be able to, I use GDAX and there is an option to Withdraw your BTC back into your Coinbase/Ledger BTC Wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:42:41
Coinbase currently took the GBP Deposit function offline, actually I think its been some few months since it happened. No idea when that is coming back. The only reason I bought directly from them is because of the Instant Pay option, otherwise I could've done it without incurring the damn fees by waiting for the Bank transfer to complete, which takes roughly 12 hours or so.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:11:28
Really? I could swore I made a payment through my card but it was then converted to Euro, all this was done in Coinbase....
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:56:15
How are you depositing? FIAT currency?
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:06:29
I use Revolut app to transfer funds to my Coinbase account without incurring any fees then transferring the funds over to GDAX. Now so far I can't comment on the Withdrawal procedure and how that works. GBP Wallet is still disabled on Coinbase, not sure when they'll bring that back but for the time being you do get a little uplift by purchasing BTC over at GDAX using EURs.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:24:59
Noob question: What about buying BTC while its low at this moment in time? Is this a wise idea?
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:09:56
Currently using GDAX at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:22:09
I just bought at the dip £4.5k GBP today,  shame I could've bought the whole coin but Coinbase is really a cunt with the limits...
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:38:49
Do you know the main differences between Trezor vs. Ledger Nano S? Just considering which one to get, I suppose the one that has the most universally accepted coins on there is the real winner right?
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:10:40
Yeah i moved it to GDAX but have to purchase through Coinbase then push it over to GDAX for a sell. Now need to figure out how to withdraw it from GDAX to GBP.

Mate I'm in tears, that's one legendary Gif +UPVOTED
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:02:42
What I don't understand is what's causing the value to increase/decrease? Also another thing that's stopping me from investing is if I do decide to sell when Bitcoin is valued at 100k+ who would take it for that price? I mean unless they know its increasing even more....
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:31:44
Tbh he won from the moment he took the domain name. IMO I don't see him quitting or being defeated, he's just that kind of guy who you ignore to the point he gives up and leaves everyone alone...
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:55:58
Definitely bro! I'm new to the game, but did hear about this back in '12 just didn't have enough to invest in it nor the time. Thing is I've done my research for the past 2 weeks non-stop but can't seem to find this burning question answered, hence why I'm hesitant to invest. Can you blame me?
