What rise are you talking about? Gold has been a currency and a store of value way longer than fiat has existed.

Renewable doesn't mean that it is unlimited, carbon neutral or neutral in any other respect. Hydroelectric dams require loads of concrete and steel to build, detroys the environment both upstream and downstream and even ignoring that the amount of hydroelectric dams we can create in the world is limited.
Same argument but different variables is valid for any other renewable source really, just because the source of energy is not depletable doesn't mean that the harnessing processes has a neglible environmental impact.

How much do you think it costs to buy a legit ID? No fake, no photoshop, not reported stolen, etc. but 100% legit?

And now the exchange owns $100mln in btc? Why would they want to do that? That's hardly part of their business model, exchanges live on fees not speculation. It would be kind of like if a casino would start playing their own games. It's hard to see why they would do that when they already have a model that makes bank no matter what direction the price goes.

Yes it did. It made you start talking about buying power all of a sudden when nobody, including you, had mentioned it previously. USD/BTC isn't and has never been set in the 2017 buying power of the USD, so I feel that you're shifting the goal post a bit here.
There's a million ways a deflationary currency isn't comparable to inflationary one. Since over time the circulating supply will (slowly) approach zero, *assuming* that it does become and then continues to be the preferred currency it's valuation would still over time be approaching infinity even if you measure it by comparing it to a (theoretical) limited good with constant supply and demand.
This is actually one of the reasons I'm skeptical about Bitcoin's fitness for any eventual widespread adoption as a currency, I think some amount of inflation is crucial due to the human psychology and our proneness for fallacies like the sunk cost-fallacy and many others. Having some inflation is a way to override some of our biases, like letting everyone think they walked away from a salary negotiation as winners even though in real terms they might actually be recieving a pay cut. With Bitcoin we would have to get used to annual paycuts in nominal terms which I think is a hard sell.


The preceding and italic *If* that you left out of your qoute was kind of important. I'm not saying that's bound to happen, just that *if* it does USD/BTC would go towards infinity and become more and more pointless as a metric along the way. (The same way that the USD/Papiermark-pair became pointless as a metric as the value of the Papiermark approached the value of the paper it was printed on. Oh, and the irony of the name of that currency and it's fate was 10/10.)

I think the proper milestones, given that where talking a digital currency, should be:
Where 1k (obviously?) equals 1024$.

Well, you can't get around the alternative cost of any purchase. Would you buy a Tesla today for 100k USD? If you would - remember that you instead could have spent those 100k on BTC and then it might turn out in 2 years from now that you effectively paid a million for it anyways. This is always the choice, spend now or invest/speculate and hopefully reap greater rewards later. It is not a phenomenon exclusive to bitcoin, it applies the same to just about anything. Are you unhappy that you bought a car 15 years ago instead of investing the funds in tech stocks?

Nah, I don't think we're talking 0 hashrate. Wouldn't increasing blocktimes fill up the backlog and increase miners fees quickly? But yeah, adjusting the difficulty is a lot slower process than the movements in markets now so it could no doubt lead to difficulties that take a while to sort themselves out.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:39:57
Won't difficulty adjust if less hashrate is availiable?
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:14:03
Well, it's not like the price of everything you might wanna buy with your BTC went up by an equal amount, so buying something today would mean a transaction using a smaller amount of coin making the fee larger in proportion to the transacted amount even though the transacted value is the same...

You're assuming that the valuation of those assets in USD stay the same. *If* bitcoin would become the preferred currency the value of the USD in relation to other things people value would tank and USD/BTC could approach infinity. Remember that in the end of 1923 1 USD would buy you 4.2 trillion(!) German Marks. At some point along the hypothetical transition it becomes useless to compare the winning currency to the losing one rather than to something people still value, like houses, food, land, gold(?), etc.

It creates BTC from electricity and hardware both paid for with fiat, so in a certain light you could see mining as exchanging fiat for BTC although through a different process with different exchange rates.

Sure is, since for some reason they're allowed to require that the merchants don't differentiate the costs between different payment options in their service contracts. But for every dollar charged to your card the vendor will recieve a smaller amount and the cost of this difference has to be passed on to you in some shape or form. Besides taking a straight up percentage there can also be a combination of fixed charges per transaction and monthly services charges.
Not sure how credit card companies handles non-payment in particular, but I used to work for a debt collecting company specialized in consumer credits for a little while. Outstanding consumer credits in general, basically anything that comes in the form of a bill, that aren't keeping up with their plan is usually sold off to a debt collecting service at a loss. The debt collecting company make their profits in the difference between the amount they manage to collect and the price they paid for said debts. If that really was where you could make a real killing, you'd probably see debt collecting services actually paying a premium for taking on those debts because of competition. But this is looking at non-payers as a group, within that group there is variation and for those that end up paying the total it sure isn't cheap to have ended up on the recieving side of this.

Uhm, really? So either your credit card company is running at a loss handing out free service to everyone or you are forgetting about the fees they charge the vendors for using their system resulting in prices being higher than they could have been using a cheaper transaction system.
