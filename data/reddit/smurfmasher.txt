I did exactly the same except I sold half my bitcoin at 10.5k. I got back every penny plus a grand that I put in 6 months ago. I now have half a coin left and that is free money to watch go to the moon or burn to zero. It is the sensible option. We had no idea what it would do at 10k let alone in 4 months. Now I can HODL to the moon for free.

I tried to get in way back in 2012 when I heard about the guy who bought a pizza for 30k btc. I spent two hours on the net trying to get a site that didn't look dodgy as hell and tried to spend 15 quid. I got through to the point where a wallet seed was needed then was prompted to hand over all my personal ID and then pay 15 quid a month for an online wallet. Thought stuff that and backed out. I still try regenerating wallet seeds once in a while in case I actually paid but didn't get an online wallet. Hoping it is in the block chain someplace. I bought in in June this year and spent about 4k. Now doing pretty well. HODL for the win but sold my initial stake and got my money back at 10k. Left about 50% in the game. And that is worth about 13k now. I watched the chrimbo massacre with barely any alarm. That kind of money IS a lot to me BUT I consider it either a go to zero or retiring at 45. I got my money back. I plan to dream I can retire at 45... rather than cutting and running and getting a half decent new car which won't change my life.

Not if you bought everything at $2000 and sold the lot 12 hours ago like I did at $4300. See you at the bottom!

I sold everything at the top ;) Told you boys yesterday. I'll be buying back in when the dive ends.

I use Electrum. simple and worked well for splitting my bitcoin cash after the fork. Free money!  Make sure you watch coinmarketcap, and Cryptomon. And whenever a mainstream news outlet says "wow look how high it is" and this is just my flawed opinion (listened to at your own risk) sell! And always buy back.

I sold last night at the peak. Now with coinbases fees to buy and to sell, If I buy now it's £100 less than if I had held.. It all depends on a bigger longer term dip. But I see a future where I go from one btc to .7 :(

Ah and now I have to figure out the bottom... it's one thing to spot the top... you have to get both the top AND the bottom right

This is not financial advise and do whatever you like at your own risk, but NO!!!! Wait for the bottom. Wait all the way down the dive till you see repeat ups and downs on the chart with matching peaks at the resistance level. Then get in.

I just sold at £3300, my choice.. not advising you do the same. But I see shoulders and a 100% increase in four weeks.

You buy when everyone is depressed about bitcoin, you sell when everyone is euphoric. Rinse and repeat.

And combine all that with technical analysis, get used to seeing the classic signals, like double horizontal peaks, cup and saucer, and understand when something is stabilizing. (rare with bitcoin) but you can see it better on lite coins charts.  Google technical analysis and learn, it's not fullproof but it helps. (my opinion do not listen to it unless you are willing to risk your own assets with no accountability from me)
