that would be me :(
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:58:30
um. how?? everytime I tried to make a transaction it said "must be over .01BTC
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:33
then I bought at 19k hoping for 20 and it dropped to 16...... I think I have a curse.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:25:13
a lot of things are bombs if you're creative enough. I can make a louder bang than most legal fireworks with like $5 of sparklers and duct tape.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:16:39
you're not able to sell or buy less than .01BTC and as a small player that really hurts me
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:23:07
but. if you are trading small amounts like myself, gdax won't let you buy or sell less than .01 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:41:57
......look at me. I'm the dipshit that hit the button. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:22:19
not more than 3 or 4 months... my first buy was around 6k. and I've been using coinbase because I can use it on mobile and I can trade bitcoin in the tiny amounts my funds allow
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:29:36
still a stupid reason for jail time. i hate the guy dont get me wrong, but he should be charged for false advertisement not this bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:19:26
I would recommend buying the dip, but not with all of your money. don't invest what you can't lose. you're going to lose some of the money right from the beginning because we're on a strong down trend, but it will come back up
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:41:45
just because someone has fireworks doesn't mean they're a terrorist. and having 49 pounds of fireworks doesn't really mean shit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:31:24
just buy the dip and HODL
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:26
yeah I know that now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:14:23
does this have anything to do with CME and futures opening up on the 10th?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:20:32
oh shit yes please.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:31:20
ha. hahaha. oooh.... well I've sold some and tried to short some (failed) but out of the maybe $150 I've put into it I've got about $100 extra... it's nice but it's not life changing hahaha
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:30:12
...............coinbase and gdax use the same exchange but they are different things. I use coinbase too, but it has much higher fees than just directly using GDAX. Coinbase let's you buy any amount, but GDAX restricts buys and sells to a minimum of .01 BTC which is a bit much for me to be moving all at once
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:49:09
it's already back to 16-17k... after I bought at 19...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:58
I sold at 12k.... like a couple days ago... your welcome.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:17:59
I hope you're joking. it seems there was an attack on NiceHash that stole 4400 BTC so this could be part of it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:41:54
is there an android based app for GDAX? the main reason I use coinbase is because I can make drop of the hat moves to maximise my position. I'm basically playing with less than $150 but I've only invested about $100 so I'm trying to maximise my position as much as possible to keep growing it to where I can let it sit as an actual investment
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:10:05
ive bought more than 50 lbs of fireworks on a reservation before. i dont deserve jailtime for that.
@_date: 2018-08-24 03:59:57
Nice try Roger Ver. I see you studied at the Trump School of Societal Debate, your input has added a yuuuge wealth of information and depth to the news presented here. Now if you would kindly fuck back off to whatever little Chinese shill farm you came from it would be much appreciated.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:06
not gonna lie. it was fear. I thought it was just gonna keep going. I bought a similar amount at 17 so hopefully I can sell high and even out my losses
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:33:12
it's the whole CME thing. they just declared that they will be trading bitcoin futures. not that I know what that means.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:58:35
of course I jumped the gun. I sold at 7300 and bought in at 7k. still bleeding from the wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:21:38
I'm basically playing with $100 or so and I sold about $40 worth of btc at 9200 thinking it was gonna drop... I hate myself too.
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:17:12
I mean the only time I smoked dmt was off a low temp dab nail...
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:35:05
Sold to cover financial emergencies a couple months ago. happy to say I bought back in at $3500!
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:23:54
one video posted yesterday.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:59:40
I have literally zero experience but logically I would sell some at the high and buy back in at a dip... so you'll still have some if it never dips? again I don't even have bitcoin I'm just trying to sort it out so anyone is welcome to correct me.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:28:52
thanks for letting me know it's on sale Reddit. though coinbase mobile is such trash I watched it go from 8300 to 8700 while spamming "buy" and coinbase giving me errors
@_date: 2018-07-28 11:01:18
I saw the post mentioning ETF. can someone help me understand what that is?
