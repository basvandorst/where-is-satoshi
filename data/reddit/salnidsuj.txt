Bitcoin is really gonna take over the world any time now!!!

Holy shit! I guess that means Bitcoin is going to be the  currency soon!!

It's really sad that Bitcoin is believed by some naive people to be the "next" world currency; yet every time someone uses it to actually buy anything, it's almost a newsworthy event....even after 10 years and massive publicity.

What adoption? I still haven’t met anyone who actually bought anything with it.
I’ve been following it since 2011... bought very early and sold near the peak. Also started
A successful business in crypto arbitrage. I think I know it pretty well, including all the arguments pro and con. 
After the crash of 2018 and all the people who lost their shirts, it’s not gonna be able to recover.
Bitcoin is finished.

Yes, it was a Bitcoin Cash fork, but the point is that the entire market is in disarray and constantly making spin-offs just proves that crypto currencies are actually of limitless supply.  With limitless supply, there is no way they can have any value. How many forks are we gonna have? Remember, every time there's a fork, it basically doubles the money supply.  
Any spinoffs just confuse the market and demonstrate that all crypto currencies just numbers on a computer screen.  With zero intrinsic value, none of them will last.
If bitcoin were the sole crypto currency out there, it might have a chance at succeeding.  But the more forks and shitcoins that are created, the less chance that will happen.

It'll never be zero, but could definitely get down below $100 again. I mean, why not?

Currencies aren't the same as movies. I understand the economic logic of the fork.  But, for the general public and for mass-adoption, there is no way it can survive if they keep doing that.  Every time there's a fork, all it does is remind people that there is nothing backing bitcoin and therefore it cannot be considered a store of value.

A huge chunk of the crypto transactions are actually just arbitrage traders, not people actually buying things.
@_date: 2019-01-21 12:15:06
Pretty much all of that is people arbitraging between exchanges at this point. A minority of exchanges are for buying/investing or actual usage of Bitcoin for any real purpose.

You are a very rare exception. The transactions of crypto coins are 95% for the purpose of simply arbitraging them.  Hell, in all of humanity, 99% of people don't even own a bitcoin.  And among those who do own it, the majority only own it because they think it's going to go up in value.  After seeing the 80% decline of this year, those same people aren't going to jump back in.
The fact that you can arbitrage crypto is the only thing it's good for, and that's my theory as to why it hasn't imploded completely yet.

Yeah, me too!  10 bitcoins in November 2015 at around $257.  Best investment ever.  Wish I bought 100!

On what basis do you think it’s a good investment? What market fundamentals support the idea that it’s going to rise?? The truth is, you’re gambling and there’s a very good chance it’s going to fall and fall and fall some more.  I don’t think Warren Buffet goes around saying he is “very confident” about his investment.
Knowing programming and understanding blockchain is an entirely different thing from investing and valuing an asset.
