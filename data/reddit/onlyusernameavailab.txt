But what's the incentive to actually do the work to add these new use-cases to BTC as a side chain? Say I hold 1 BTC and implementing the side chain increases the value of BTC by 10% that means I'm only making $1,700 for a lot of work.
There's more incentive for my to ICO, make a bunch of money and keep developing the coin for that use case.
I agree that in theory people will want a single currency, but I'm not sold that it's realistic

Why would miners start a coin that gives them lower fees?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:34:39
Forsure. Those are all really good points.
The reason I'm concerned about fees is because I worry it makes it harder for bitcoin to be adopted in less affluent countries. Hopefully a solution (maybe lightening) fixes this and then bitcoin becomes even more valuable.

Ok that makes sense. Thanks for that answer. Can Bitcoin handle 300 million users? I notice that there are times when it has thousands of unconfirmed transactions.

Very interesting, thanks! Where can I find those same graphs for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:35:51
Yup, after posting that I did some more research. Scary stuff. The centralization issue is clearly a massive one

This was incredible to read. Thank you so much. Now I understand why r/bitcoin censors BCH posts. They're trying to protect people. Why don't they pin these reasons to the top of the page?

Thanks! Appreciate the response.

But if he was pumping and dumping why didn't he dump?

Why will a bigger block size increase centralization? Doesn't it just lower fees and increase transaction speeds?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:01:23
Forsure, I now understand the cons to the blocksize increase and not just the pros (which obviously makes a huge difference in my opinion)
Are you worried about the high Bitcoin fees? Or do you just see that as the cost of a decentralized coin?

What? I'm admittedly new, but Roger Ver owned BTC up until a month ago. Are you sure he created BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:20:07
Why is BCH centralized and BTC decentralized? Aren't they both run on the same chain?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:48:13
Why would he want to attack Bitcoin?

So you can withdraw to a canadian bank account? Coinbase won't allow Canadians to sell their coins
