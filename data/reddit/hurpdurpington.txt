I have read all of, understood all of, and modified the source code of the Bitcoin client. There's not much extra in there - it's basically all the protocol you'd expect, as defined in the original white-paper. I'm friends with a developer of one of the alternative wallets/clients for Bitcoin who made a couple million back in the day when the markets dropped for the second time. He didn't trust the Bitcoin client which is why he wrote his own 'secure' version. Of course he added his own features, but he didn't deviate too far from the original given its pretty bare-bones in places. Would I trust my friend and run his wallet? Probably not. Even though he has a pretty large user base now, we are both security contractors and have seen waaay too many cases of people getting pwnt by software-from-a-friend's they trusted.
And while running software you don't trust is never good, I don't think most people are capable of making a rational judgement on whether software/hardware is trustworthy. Even if the NSA or CIA developed these coins (which doesn't really make sense given each of these agencies have a strict foreign intelligence mission) it's hard to see how they could leverage an arbitrary proof-of-work system for anything tangible (other than now having the hash for the sequential binary increase of the input data). I suppose some theorists would say that they're using the coins and market for profit, but being that they can always ask for more tax dollars or rack up some debt... it's just easier to go farther in the hole. I'd probably be more leery of the Chinese ASIC's coming over-seas. There's something that's sketchy.
