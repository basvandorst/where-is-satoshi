Does anyone really know what’s gonna happen to currency I was simply asking if I switched my hash rate over to BcH if I could maybe have a better reward because the pool hash rate is so low for it right now rant over guys thanks for all the insight

Obviously btc is way more I don’t care about the value I care about the mining profitability right now. We are going to be hooking up another 12 machines in December so I guess I wasn’t as clear as I should have been. I looked at the pool hash rate for BCH and it seems is awfully low for it to be up 28% on bittrex. So what I’m asking is would it be more profitable to mine BCH as it’s climbing steadily right now? So yes I’m looking for an opinion.

Because our electrician says it’s against code to have 240 going to a 120 outlet with bigger gauge wire. He wants us to take all of our power cables to our psus and get different caps for the ends so we can plug them into an actual 240 outlet legit? Seems like a ton of work for no reason
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:41:34
So again does anyone have any ideas if switching to BCH would be more profitable right now?

Hey so we bought the pdu and the pdu cables so I can run 120volt plugs in to the pdu that’s plugged into a 240 20 amp outlet and it will run 4 machines? Can I run more then 4?
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:53:28
So if I switch over now mine for about a week then switch back might be profitable

Tmeljr if you can respond to my last post that would be sweet man 
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:22:31
What’s a PDU? Like a step up step down converter?
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:10:54
What should you use
@_date: 2017-10-12 07:56:51
Dono I just hooked them up 
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:16:16
Did you wire this 240 outlet yourself is it in your home? I purchased a warehouse for my bitcoin farm and right now I’m sitting on machines and no mining...
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:27:24
It thanks for that awesome information you have provided 
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:43:37
And also I’ve only been on reddit two weeks I only joined to have some insight on a multi-pool app I heard about. There is no need to justify my TH rate to anyone on reddit. But if some of you nerds are horny to see 100 THS which isn’t that much really give me your email I’ll send you plenty of pictures 
There maybe a couple of dick picks in there so be careful

I also agree I successfully launched 4 s9s today and I couldn’t be more excited to launch the other 7 I have on the way! 
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:28:20
Any PDU you would recommend
