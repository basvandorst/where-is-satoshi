Let's be honest here, if i were to find hard evidence or proof that countered any of your claims, you'd just say i was full of shit or it was liberal propaganda. So there's no point to arguing with you. You've already made up your mind and jesus fucking christ himself couldn't change it. Hence my response of ◔_◔.

The way i read it was that the hacker installed malware on the laptop using his RDP access. It's fairly easy to capture key strokes with malware, including the user typing the password for his SSH key.

I think has a valid point. Just because your money is in a bank doesn't mean it's safe. Banks have failed and people have lost money. He's pointing out that letting someone else keep your money is not a guarantee that you will get your money. The only way to know for sure that your money is yours is to withdraw it all from the bank and stuff it under your mattress. 
Also, calling OP an dumbass is not adding to the discussion. There's no reason to insult someone because you disagree with their opinion.

If we go by your logic, most of Shakespeare's work would never have been made. Just because there are distasteful or "vulgar" scenes doesn't mean the show is bad. It's just showing a glimpse into what might actually be a real-world situation. Real life isn't always positive or good. Lots of bad stuff happens. I, personally, have no interest in watching some fake happy-go-lucky everyone wins and no one dies type of show that you are talking about. To each his own, i suppose.

Can someone ELI5: slow blocks vs quick/fast blocks? I'm not familiar with this concept. (Google is failing me atm.)
