Yeah sure. They deliver the Bitcoins in 1-12 hours after the payment. 
Just make sure your Skrill is verified, otherwise your payment won't be accepted

Well that would not be a smart move. That would be like fighting a battle they cannot win. 
btc this proposal sounds like it came straight from the nsa,maybe the french are too scared to think on their own.
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:55:58
Can you elaborate on this one?
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:27:44
Not all Banks are ignorant. PrivatBank seems to be the smartest one out there, lets see how this will unfold

Is it a really concensus census? Or just initiating talk? Anyway it is a step in the right direction.
@_date: 2015-12-24 19:51:06
 - their limit is 12 BTC per transaction, but you can buy multiple times. Last Monday we bought around 100 BTC from them with Neteller without problems
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:49:13
That is not really reasonable. Their economy will collapse in 1-2 years if they enforce that ban.
However those are good news for Bitcoin.

I think he is talking about the smaller amounst. For example if you buy 0.5 btc the price is 4-5% higher. 
That is pretty common in business, the bigger player you are the bigger discount you get...
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:33:48
where did you get this from? it is from  isn't it? can you tell me how much you paid for it and show me your winning ticket?
@_date: 2015-12-24 23:06:05
Why do you think so? Lately we bought 100+ btc from them and everything went smooth
This is the last transaction, when they delivered the last 12 BTC we bought:

Actually the minimum is 0.1 BTC, which is acceptable amount for testing. 
In Poland a lot of companies rent floors of bulding to accomodate their offices, however I am not aware where they are located exactly, i haven't visited. Have you?
The positive thing here is that you are not sending BTC to them, but you are sending fiat with Bank Transfer/Neteller/Skrill, which are reversible methods and you can start a chargeback if you do not receive the BTC. I would say that is pretty simple and transparent process.

You are right and bandband234 is also right. 
The premium fee is applied to smaller amounts, but the price is normal for the higher amounts.

Then you should say it is a new one. You can review an exchange only if you have experience with it, not by the looks of it. If you want to review it by the looks, you can only comment on the design.
Take a look at this example: My account is 20x better than yours in karma (karma is the "review" of reddit), should i say that you are a scammer? No, i can just say that you are newer.

Great news! this also beats the ios block for bitcoin since ios will NOT block a yahoo app for sure!
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:53:43
so who's the presenter of the video? keep in mind that the presenter should have some bitcoin knowledge beside the boops.
@_date: 2014-10-22 00:52:42
The whole "Digital crypto-currency process" is an amazing thing. Glad you are not of the common newbies which are only here for the profit
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:56:00
The personal details of each member should be kept secret. So you are right, publishing a list can lead to government abuse and requests for member's details. 
And the next thing the government will try to do - put the most influential bitcoin people behind bars.
@_date: 2014-07-23 13:32:14
there will be more with time
@_date: 2014-07-21 00:50:49
Well all i can say is lucky you! I have no one to discuss it with in real live
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:56:29
Anyone tried it? What are the limits so far?
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:08:34
wake up!
@_date: 2014-12-06 18:16:15
Fiverr first takes $1 from the total sum of $5. Now on top of that they take 10% or 5%, depending from the amount you are paying! Thieves!
@_date: 2014-10-22 00:46:40
Just another hater. Nothing important. Maybe even getting paid to hate
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:10:12
we all believe in bitcoin but a kidney would be a little too much mate! 
health first! bitcoin second! 
@_date: 2014-12-06 18:16:57
If you pay $5.5 - they take $1.5 for themselves! 
If you pay $21, they take $5 for themselves! 
Rip off!
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:14:26
Completely true! More people joining = higher value!
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:57:26
Congrats. I hope one day it will reach 1M. To the million.
@_date: 2014-07-23 13:33:40
still having eye problems mr high?
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:04:47
now IOS can simply hide under the carpet. there is no way they would kick out a Yahoo app from their market! way to go yahoo!
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:27:33
thanks for the advice,that sounds reasonable. 
i wasnt sure that the 3% is a fair fee but i guess it is for a bank transfer...
@_date: 2016-01-18 02:03:23
So how did this e-mail managed to show up in public again? 
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:02:37
That is the right answer. Probably just doing a little "test" before selling them, and making some profit too.
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:03:37
Good luck with taking over bitcoin. They may try to create their own blockchain but that won't really work at the end. Blockchain without Bitcoin is even silly to imagine.
