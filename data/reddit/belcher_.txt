You can use importaddress and importprivkey today with a pruned wallet, but you have to set the rescan parameter to false. Meaning you can import addresses and privkeys that have never been used before on the blockchain.

Transaction fees should surpass inflation in miner income far sooner than when the last satoshi is mined in about the year 2140.
Right now bitcoin inflation is about 4%, and 3 out of every 4 bitcoins have already been mined. So the era of low bitcoin inflation is rapidly arriving.

The change is already happening, today bitcoin monetary inflation (which is miner income) is about 4%. So we're already well on our way to miners funding themselves by transaction fees.

Multisig is a good method.
It works by requiring that multiple private keys are needed to spend your coins. You spread them across many of your computers and smartphones. It offers far more protection because a hacker or malware is unlikely to infect all your hardware at once.
Unlike with hardware wallets, you don't need to buy anything.
Here's a tutorial for doing it with Electrum:

Yes, so what I'm saying only counts for when you've got a sync'd node and want to import a new address into it.
If your node already knows the addresses beforehand it don't need to re-scan, it can just get the transactions the first time it scans.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:47:30

If someone creates a coin that doesn't follow all the rules of bitcoin, your wallet will reject that coin as though it never existed.
In the same way that if someone gives you a gold coin that is actually made of steel you can reject it. With bitcoin, your wallet software automatically runs these checks so you don't have to check each coin yourself like with gold or paper banknotes.
These rules of bitcoin are fairly simple: A coin can only be spent by the holder of the private key, a coin can only be spent once, coins are only created by the miners according to a well-defined schedule that puts a limit on 21 million, and all the tricky rules that make the system work are followed (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, etc)
Note that not all wallets run these checks, only wallets backed by full nodes do. For example web wallets like blockchain.info entirely trust the website, which could trick you by printing infinite coins or spending a coin not belonging to it.

If your node is in the pruned state then it will download the blockchain again to scan it.
@_date: 2016-08-01 13:45:24
Yes, it's not possible.
Even with any new release the problem isn't actually solved but just moved around. You still need to somehow scan the blockchain to find your historical transactions, even if bitcoin-qt doesn't do the scanning. I expect in future cold storage methods will somehow store your historical transactions as well as the private keys.
It's worth mentioning you can import multiple addresses and then rescan them all at once.

So I misunderstood what you wrote. I thought you were saying that the attacking miners would eventually stop and go back to mining something valuable, but the economy of the attacked coin is stuck with their new soft fork rule.

With Gox, the bitcoins were being drained for years beforehand and nobody really knew exactly which addresses were the thief's.
In this hack Bitfinex and BitGo know exactly which addresses to watch.
At the start of the block size conflict in summer 2015 the bitcoin community really showed how dumb and easily manipulated it can be. That was sorted out but it took months of debate and careful explanation. So I understand that the hacker might want to spend a small portion of his loot to make absolutely sure the rest stays his.

It was interesting and not-entirely-unexpected that nobody 51% attacked the ethereum classic chain. There was enough speculation in it's small economy that the minority chain was very profitable to mine.
That's one issue with 51% attacks is they have a cost. Anyone with that hash power who is economically motivated would always just mine it honestly.
It's also worth mentioning that even getting the agreement of most big exchanges isn't enough to kill the minority chain. There exist decentralized exchanges like Bitsquare (which bootstrapped ethereum classic trading) as well as simple OTC trading on IRC and forums which could always provide liquidity.

Bitcoin-qt will rescan the blockchain to find transactions to and from the address you're importing.
If you're confident the imported address has never been used before, you can tell it to skip rescanning. Apart from that there's no other way right now.
I hear there are plans to have RPC methods that let you import individual transactions to the wallet.dat file so if you get the transactions some other way you could import them without rescanning.

The re-org chain could effectively undo some transactions. So they only happen if the private key has already created a signature for moving some bitcoins.

The only alternative to that is trust in the issuer or registrar. Not that justified trust is a bad thing, but trust makes systems brittle, opaque, and costly to operate.

It's more of a concept from finance rather than specifically bitcoin. To short it you just need to find a way to borrow it, then you sell it and buy it back (hopefully cheaper) to pay back your loan.
Bitfinex and other exchanges would make this easier by having the lending/borrowing done automatically when a trader wanted to open a short. But it has a problem that however long the position is open you're at risk from bitfinex itself.

A similar thing *did* happen to the altcoin ethereum, which has far weaker security (users are routinely advised to switch off verification to improve speed) that made it much easier for the central dictator vbuterin to roll back a transaction.

In order to stop funds being added to an already-used address, each node would have to keep a database of already-used addresses to verify. It would be much less scalable. Right now each node only needs a database of all unspent transaction outputs in order to verify that new transactions and blocks are valid.
The wiki page author is obviously annoyed about this as well: 
    Address reuse refers to the use of the same address for multiple transactions. [...] It also only functions by accident, not by design, so cannot be depended on to work reliably.


I think there's no other answer except *"Satoshi made it that way"*. Maybe he thought it would improve privacy or that it would scale better, who knows. I don't think he ever said.


They do not have the same transactions. The first transaction in a block (called the coinbase transaction) is one which send the block reward, new bitcoins + miner fees. The miner sets their own bitcoin address to be the output of the coinbase transaction. So each miner is working on a slightly different block because each miner has a different payout address.


Your understand is correct. There is one crucial missing point which is that bitcoin nodes will follow the blockchain that has the most proof-of-work done on it. This is how every node can come to a consensus with every other node of the history of all bitcoin transactions. Even if a node leaves the p2p network and later comes back, it can download the blocks that happened in that time, verify their proof-of-work and all other rules, and know that that is a true record of what happened. ("True record" here means if that node tries to trade bitcoins, other nodes will accept them)

Soon enough no more new bitcoins will be created and the money supply can be entirely inflation-free, capped at 21 million bitcoins. Approximately 75% of all bitcoins have already been mined, in the year 2022 (6 years away) that number will be 90%

The average time between blocks is 10 minutes but it can vary quite a lot.

That's not really how soft forks work. If none of the economy is using full nodes to enforce this soft fork, the legitimate miners can break the new rules without any of their blocks being rejected.
Good idea though, I wonder if something similar could be done where the attacking miners could leave something behind that kills the chain even after their 51% attack ends. I think it's unlikely because otherwise bitcoin miners could do it today.

@_date: 2016-04-30 11:18:08


Pruning all spent transactions (what bitcoin does) means the pruned blockchain grows as O(number of users). So the vast majority of satoshidices' transactions can be pruned.
Not knowing which transactions are spent (as monero operates) means the pruned blockchain grows as O(number of transactions) =~ O(time) So monero's pruning scales far worse.




That's not a really a cap if the money supply grows forever. You know central banks have an inflation target of 1-2% a year? Monero is barely any different then.

Yes your customer will have to wait 3-4 confirmations (probably 1 or 2 is fine though)
I'm curious to know which other payment network apart from physical cash allows you to accept and settle $10k immediately. Credit cards and cheques can be reversed months after and I'm fairly sure you can't buy things worth $10k with no other information using those methods either.
One thing you could try is taking your customer's name, address, all other information and then asking them to sign a contract of the sale. Then if they reverse the payment you know where to find them. This is ultimately how cheques and credit cards work, since the bank has all the information and is able to chase.

You know how when you browser the web with tor you need to delete cookies? Bitcoin addresses are like cookies, they can track you even through tor. And you can't delete them.
You would need to request every address from a server through a different tor circuit, and wait a random time between requests so the server doesn't use timing correlation to link the addresses together.

It seems to work by connecting to every single bitcoin node that allows incoming connections into the network. It plans to see double-spend attempts where two parts of the network see two different transactions.
Trouble is, it can be easily beaten by sending the double spend directly to a miner (who wont rebroadcast because they want to see all the transaction fees for themselves) Also most miners will mine a higher-fee transaction instead of a lower one, so you can doublespend by increasing the fee you pay.

Fees going up is kinda the point. 75% of all bitcoins that will ever exist have been mined. In a few weeks the miner reward will half. We're rapidly approaching the time when transaction fees must take over from inflation in funding bitcoin security.
We know that too-large blocks are damaging for bitcoin's decentralization, so that's not an option. Plus a contentious hard fork is very dangerous because not everyone agrees with it and it could fracture apart the currency.
As a positive side effect, fees going up means spam like Eternity Wall and CryptoGraffiti will become uneconomical.

It doesn't send the whole sum of the address contents. To be completely accurate: it spends the whole sum of an unspent transaction output. One address may have many of these outputs (although thats [discouraged]( That's just the way the system was designed.
An accurate analogy I've heard is that unspent outputs are most similar to coins in meatspace. These coins live on bitcoin addresses, and a bitcoin transaction is like melting down one or more coins to create new ones.
I've heard Luke-jr talk about how he'd like to create a wallet GUI that had a few coin icons and the user could drag and drop them to choose which unspent transaction outputs to use as inputs.


Each miner has the block reward going to their own bitcoin address. That address is part of the coinbase transaction which is hashed to produce the merkle root in the block header. So each miner has a different merkle root and therefore are hashing different block headers.
Also miners don't necessarily have the same non-coinbase transactions either, because of latency or different inclusion policies.

Any web wallet is generally unsafe and it's good you're ditching it.
Electrum is quick to setup, but you trust the electrum servers with your privacy, and you trust the miners not to print infinite bitcoins or confiscate bitcoins. Electrum also has a multisig wallet feature where you can spread your private keys over many different computers, which makes it less likely that malware will steal your coins.
Bitcoin-Qt or Armory take a longer to setup but are fully-validating which means you would use bitcoin in a trustless way and only trust the miners to choosing the ordering of transactions.

A problem with this is customers get lazy, they receive their goods and simply don't bother to log on and release funds. This is quite common so there should be a way for the merchant to get his money out.
I'd say the best smart contract for commerce is [2of3 multisig combined with op_csv]( It would mean after the timeout, the merchant alone can spend the coins and they could just become a part of the merchants wallet, no need for a "withdraw money from escrow" transcation.

Bitcoin doesn't become confirm instantly. It takes some time for the transaction to become permanent and irreversible.
I'm guessing you were buying something that gets delivered to you instantly and/or is high-value. In that situation you have to wait for the transaction to confirm with more certainty.
It's the same in for other currencies and payment networks. You can't buy a house with a cheque, around here you'd have to wait for several hours for the bank transfer to go through and become irreversible before you get the keys to the front door.
In the future for things like buying coffee, we'd build a network for payment channels where the bitcoin payments can be routed fast and would confirm instantly. But it doesn't exist yet, we're in early days.

There's a lot of spam that needs to be purged. I'd be happy to see Eternity Wall and CryptoGraffiti become uneconomical for example.
The biggest problem with rising fees I see is that some wallets don't handle them correctly yet. Ideally it would be done something like Electrum, Mycelium or Bitcoin Core which can estimate the fees by watching how long other transactions take to get mined, so they can react to market conditions. Wallets I've seen like Multibit, Breadwallet, blockchain.info don't react to conditions (worst still, some dont even allow the user to edit the fee).
If all those wallets are patched to estimate the fee transparently to the user then the bitcoin ecosystem will be in a much better place. Wallets that correctly estimated fees were unaffected by the spam attacks and rising fees from a few months ago.

2. It's possible to use bitcoin in an anonymous way, although its subtle and easy to get wrong.
3. No guarantees on anything.
4. There's lots of ways to get it wrong, anyone can come up with a security and privacy scheme that they themselves cannot break.

Sometimes you have coups that take over previously-free regimes and install brutal dictatorships.

If they were a tourist from another country even cheques and credit cards become more tricky, depending on the country.

LN is inherently an online protocol. The best way to hold bitcoins for the long term would be to close the payment channel and send the bitcoins to the blockchain in cold storage. Since you're holding for a long time anyway, you can pay a low miner fee and be prepared to wait however long it takes to confirm.

Using a wallet backed by a full node is the only way to use bitcoin in a trustless way. It's the only way to know for sure that none of bitcoin's rules have been broken. Rules like no coins were spent not belonging to the owner, that no coins were spent twice, that no inflation happens outside of the schedule and that all the rules needed to make the system work are followed (e.g. difficulty.) All other kinds of wallet involve trusting a third party server.

You talk a lot about your need for anonymity, are you aware that any web wallet you use can deanonymize you? You use their infrastructure to access the bitcoin network through their website, they can see all your addresses, how many bitcoins you have, where you spent them, etc unless you use tor they can see your IP address too.
It depends on exactly who you need to be anonymous against, but web wallets are one of the worst solutions for anonymity and privacy.
Aside from that, your OP is good. Multisig is really great. Did you know that [12% of all bitcoins are held in p2sh/multisig addresses]( ?

I disagree with this. Decentralization is one of the fundamentals of bitcoin but it's effects are known to everyone.
Decentralization is the reason you can use bitcoin without giving an ID, anywhere in the world, why transactions are censorship resistant and irreversible, and why if you keep your private key safe then nobody can take you bitcoins from you no matter what. Many unbanked people are crying out for something you don't need an ID to use, for example.

Consensus is a social phenomenon. To get people to run your new rules you need to convince them somehow. You could try posting on reddit, talking to people at meetups, writing opinion pieces or any other method.
Look up the UASF movement which was literally a social movement which tried to get people to use different node software, it worked and that's how segwit was added to bitcoin. Other examples of proposed changes were BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited which all failed.
The other commenters are talking about nodes, which is slightly wrong. The important thing is whether those nodes are used for economic activity, a node that runs on rented hardware and doesn't have an attached wallet does not affect the rules of bitcoin. It's an important point that bitcoin is given value by people who are willing to accept it in trade for real goods and services, they are called "merchants", "economic actors" or "[the economic majority]( and they express their view using full node wallets which are just tools.
Have a look at this explanation of full nodes and bitcoin's security model: 
Note that miners are mostly irrelevant to bitcoin's rules. Miners set the history of valid transactions, the economic majority sets the validity rules of what makes a transaction valid.

It could be argued this is already incentivized. A full node doesn't suffer from many security problems and attacks that lightweight nodes can fall to. For example the 4th July 2015 accidental chain fork effected many kinds of wallets. Here is the wiki page on this event  Notice how updated node software was completely unaffected by the fork. All other wallets required either extra confirmations or checking that the third-party institution was running the correct version. Another concrete example is if an exchanger uses a lightweight wallet, it would be much easier to partition it from the rest of the network and feed it false data, you could use that method to steal an unlimited amount of coins from the exchange by repeatedly depositing and withdrawing.
Another way economic full node usage is incentivized is privacy. All lightweight wallets require telling some third party what all your addresses are. Only a full node which downloads the entire history of all addresses can learn it's own balance without anyone else knowing.

So why do members of the other sub hate segwit so much? That's not consistent with "just wanting to see something being done".
The real reason they don't like segwit, and that posts against segwit get upvoted so much over there, is that it is a competing solution to their big-block-hardfork plan.
Fact is you've got several regular r/buttcoin posters who also post at r/btc a lot and completely agree with the big-blocker-hard-fork point of view. See [this comment train]( where OneOfManyUsers and jstolfi (both buttcoiners) talk about how great Bitcoin Classic is.

Multisig is a good solution, where the coins are not on a single computer and its unlikely that multiple of your computers will be hacked.
A great implementation of it I've seen is Electrum's two-factor-authentication. Where a 2-of-3 wallet is made, one privkey encryption on your hard drive as normal, another on a paper backup and a third on Electrum's server. Electrum's server will send you an SMS to confirm and only then will sign you transaction. The server asks charges you for the service. You can get your coins out for free, with no charge using the paper backup.

When you integrate SPV bloom filters, have you thought about attempting to fix the privacy vulnerability like what bitsquare did.

One reason we say to wait for LN to become mature is that people may invent other technologies by then too. For example Payment Channel Factories were invented recently which also improves scalability, yet they were not part of the discussion in 2015 because they didn't exist yet. This is one reason it may not be productive to debate block sizes in 10 years when nobody knows what the landscape will look like then. Bitcoin itself isn't even 10 years old.


It's a serious misconception that high demand is bad for bitcoin. In reality bitcoin *requires* that demand for block space is higher than supply. For three reasons 1) To avoid fee sniping 2) To provide miners with an income as inflation drops 3) To add a cost to non-monetary uses of the blockchain.
Here are some links on this matter (they are all on that reading list I posted)
* 
* 
* 
* 
You asked about sharding, have a look at petertodd's writeup about it: 
I'm still not convinced that there's any urgency in increasing on-chain capacity. What exactly is the problem today? High fees? Good, that means the miners have a sustainable source of income, it means fee sniping is less likely and that people will use precious block space more carefully. Saying high fees are a disaster is like saying *"Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded"*.
I think the *real* urgency is miner centralization. Right now competitive mining requires membership of a centralized relay network. Mining pools routinely use spy mining. I would actually support a *reduction* in on-chain capacity by increasing the block interval to be longer than 10 minutes, which would mean a latency becomes less important.
Satoshi's great innovation was mining. This decentralized solution to the double spending problem. Today it's not working very well at all, and yet people are considering making it *even worse* just so they can copy the features of paypal and VISA? It seems insane to me, totally wrong priorities.

The next block after genesis is dated 9th January, and [Satoshi's email with the release]( is also dated then.

Look up guidance from the issuing authority of their ID.
E.G. For UK drivers licenses you can [Check someone's driving licence information]( and also read their [Guidance on False ID]( which lists security features like holding under UV light.
Thing is, people twiddle their thumbs for hours and days when buying real estate or other high value products as standard so your customer will probably be expecting it for $10k.

The block interval has an average of 10 minutes but not every block interval is exactly 10 minutes. In statistics it's called a poisson process, where random events have the same probability of happening in each time interval. There are lots of block intervals with a time less than 10 minutes but then a few block intervals much longer which bump up the average to 10.
So you can get unlucky and the bitcoin network wont find a block for a whole hour.

It might be useful for people who don't want to keep their bitcoins secure themselves, but I think in practice that won't happen much.
Bitcoins are quite easy to keep secure compared to cash, so there's much less reason to hold them in trust in some kind of bank account.
I'll repeat my advice for keeping bitcoins secure: Use wallet software that supports multisig wallets, for example Electrum or Armory. Then you can have your private keys split amongst many different machines; a desktop, smartphone and physical storage on paper. Malware is unlikely to infect all of those at once and the loss of one or two doesn't mean you lose all your coins (depending in the wallet parameters). Plus you don't have to pay for any hardware wallets.

If the economy doesn't want to use one of those chains then the value of its cryptocurrency will be very low, and miners will effectively be burning a huge amount of money as long as they continue.

Pretty much. Except the creator probably isn't Japanese, nobody knows really. Also proof-of-work isn't very complicated (depending), its essentially solving the problem of sha256\^2(block-header) &lt; target, see 


Yes so the blockchain contains all transactions that ever happened. Transactions work with digital signatures, so every coin can only be spent if a valid digital signature is produced which only someone who knows the private key of that coin can create. Every fully-verifying wallet checks that every digital signature and other rules are valid, otherwise it won't accept the bitcoin transaction as genuine. So in other words every fully-verifying wallet checks all the rules, and one of those rules is that only miners can create coins out of nothing and only following a [strict schedule.](
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:48:56
More precisely, economic actors validate the rules of bitcoin by downloading the blockchain. They use full node wallets as the tool to do this.
Bitcoin gets its value from people willing to trade real goods and services in exchange for it, so bitcoin's rules are controlled by all those people and not miners. Miners together set the history of valid transactions, the economy chooses which transactions are valid. Therefore a hard fork (i.e. a backward incompatible change of validity rules) is controlled only by the economy.

Then some people won't use it, the price will drop until people use it again. Also I'd say that paying even $20 might not be too much as an entry fee to a global censorship-resistant payment network. After you pay the entry fee you can send or receive as many transactions as you want.
Rationing a resource always means some uses will have to go without. This rationing isn't something we invented, it's imposed on us by physical reality because computers use resources.


I know you didn't saying it, but paypal/visa's business model and innovation is to have a trusted third party hold all the money in return for being able to make transactions on the internet. Advocating raising the block size is moving towards that model, where some decentralization is lost in return for more transactions.


Right now maybe 2 or 3 individuals have control over 51% of hash power and therefore can reverse any bitcoin transaction they want, no matter how many confirmations it has. The fact that they *choose not to do this* is irrelevant. It's not talked about much here because everyone is so bullish but this is actually a disaster. It's a big reason why me and many others oppose any movement to making the problem even worse.

It might be because Luke's [view for a long time has been that bitcoin's blocks are already too big]( (And I am somewhat sympathetic). Segwit usage for normal transactions makes blocks bigger and that might be why he's saying segwit transactions are harmful. Because of this Luke has advocated that segwit should only be used by LN and other new scalability tech, and not used just to increase the block size.
Segwit also fixes the incentives around UTXO creating/spending and fixes the quadratic sighash scaling problem, and some other stuff. So it can also be argued that not adopting segwit is also harming bitcoin.

For security I'd recommend using a multisig wallet like Electrum with private keys spread over many computers, or a hardware wallet.
Each confirmation exponentially decreases the odds that a double spend against you will succeed. Generally 1-6 is plenty secure for almost all uses, there is documentation on bitcoin.org which explains in more detail.
For the other stuff you don't necessarily need to know or understand, same way most users don't understand the finer details of HTTP but can still use the web.

I think the opposite, Bitcoin with full blocks is the only way it can work. Without full blocks, users have no reason to pay enough transaction fees which are absolutely needed to fund the miners once inflation goes to zero.
As I've explained before, it wasn't a DOS attack, there was plenty of users who were not denied service. This happened because they used correctly-coded wallets. The real problem is wallets like Multibit, Breadwallet and blockchain.info which don't react to market conditions (worst still, some dont even allow the user to edit the fee). DOS = denial of service, so if service wasnt denied then it wasnt a DOS, my own transactions during that time went through perfectly fine.

You can run code with much less disk space by enabling blockchain pruning, it can be made to use only about 2gb. Bandwidth can be reduced by running with -listen=0
Running your own full node is the only way to get blockchain information privately. All other methods involve querying a third party server.
Another way you could try is to implement bip37 bloom filters and have the option to point the wallet to get blockchain information from a full node controlled by the user.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:02:38

That's where you're wrong, and you should probably read the article again more closely.
Bitcoin won't spread and become a currency because people want to get rid of it by spending it. Bitcoin has become more popular and more deeply embedded in public consciousness exactly because of the holding and the resulting price increase.
Think of it with other currencies: everyone wanted to get rid of and spend the Weimar Republic Deutschmark and the Zimbabwean dollar. And that destroyed them, they are no longer currencies. But really high quality money is what people want to hold onto. The florins, ducats and sequins of the Italian city-states did not dominate Mediterranean trade because they were poor quality coins, but because they were the highest quality.


Firstly, you don't have high transaction fees and long waits at the same time. It's high transaction fees **or** long waits, because if you pay a high enough fee your transaction can be confirmed in the next block same as it always has been.
Secondly, bitcoin is a victim of it's own success at this point. We need to wait for new technology to be developed. But to say bitcoin is failing because of high demand for block space is like saying *nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded*.

No, consensus on the rules is controlled only by the economy who use full nodes as a tool. See [other post]( and [this one]( Generally all code is open source so everybody can read it themselves to decide for themselves if they want to run it.
Consensus is the idea that all who agree cooperative, not that everyone must agree. If some people don't agree then they split off into their own consensus which we call an altcoin.
Developers have nothing to do with it except some of them might be more influential in convincing people. But still, if we take the example of the UASF movement, we see that the Core developers did not have consensus in favour of the UASF, yet it still happened.

Regarding pull number, not really. The word "fork" is overloaded here, it may mean:
1. Software fork, where you press "fork" on github. This just copies the source code, the way people actually improve bitcoin is to fork the software add their own edits and create a pull request where they ask for those edits to be merged back into the main bitcoin code.
1. Fork as short for hard fork which is incorrectly used to mean bitcoin airdrop. Equivalent of an altcoin with initial premine given to existing bitcoin owners.
1. Fork meaning a change of the bitcoin consensus rules, as in "soft fork" or "hard fork".
1. Fork meaning an chain split.
IMO most of them are used incorrectly, I'd only use the word fork to mean software fork on github becaus the other usages are just confusing. But words get their meaning from use, so we can't really do much about incorrect usage.

It seems so. He added the block size limit hidden in other updates without telling anybody. When people found out he brushed it off.
At one point Satoshi [wrote]( *"Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices."* 
Not to mention Satoshi actually designed the system to allow fees to be paid to miners to make transactions confirm faster. From my point of view Satoshi knew what would happen but didn't talk about it much so as not to reduce enthusiasm.
The second ever user of bitcoin, Hal Finney, wrote that [Bitcoin will scale by layers]( all the way back in 2010.
There's some liars and altcoin pumpers going around saying Satoshi wanted this or that, but if you read the works more closely back then its clear to me Satoshi knew how bitcoin worked and knew the limitations and how to get past them.

There's two issues here: fixed denominations which require a big coin to be split up into small amounts which are coinjoined and often recombined, and change outputs in coinjoins.
JoinMarket doesn't have the first problem; if a user wants to send 10 BTC they just create a single coinjoin with that amount.
JoinMarket does have the second problem with change, but it's possible for a user to create sweep-coinjoins which don't create a change output. The tumbler script uses these kinds of coinjoins.

Stealth addresses aren't really that useful: 
Also let's not forget that your alt has degraded scalability (full nodes must store the perpetually growing transaction output set) in order to get the privacy it has. Degraded scalability means less security. There's no point having a private coin if its security is bad enough that it gets attacked and destroyed. Why don't you just use digicash, which is perfectly private on an information-theory level, but is also completely centralized and therefore has no security at all.

The rules of bitcoin transactions are controlled by those willing to trade something in return for bitcoin. They enforce their power by using full node wallets (full nodes are those which check all the rules of bitcoin). The ordering and history of bitcoin transactions are controlled by miners.
Developers don't have any control. They just write software which people may or may not run. In fact we've already had one situation where the Bitcoin Core developer team was against a particular change to the bitcoin rules, yet that change happened anyway, proving that the developers don't have control:

If bitcoin wasn't fungible then you'd expect a secondary market where certain coins could be sold at a discount. We don't observe any market like that.

I think it's probably a combination of the easier installation, marketing budget and incentives (wasabi users have slightly more of an incentive to shill it because it makes their coinjoins happen faster). I also wouldn't take it for granted that wasabi is more popular, I wouldn't be surprised if JoinMarket mixes more by volume, because one 20btc coinjoin on its own has more volume than 100 or 200 wasabi coinjoins. There could be an effect that JM users just keep quiet more.

There's an issue with DOS resistance, where dandelion-enabled nodes would require 2-3 mempools to also keep track of transactions in the stem phase, and that would be nice to avoid. Last I heard no-one is working on it. Search around a bit, I think there's a few good stackexchange discussions on the topic.

Paper wallets encourage address reuse, they require the user to deal with raw privkeys which is dangerous, they encourage the use of centralized address lookup sites. Users are sometimes encouraged to use raw transactions which is dangerous and paper wallets almost always rely on cryptography written in javascript.
They also aren't actually a *wallet*. They can't tell you when you received bitcoin, let alone verify that the transactions are valid with a full node.
A much better way to store bitcoins on paper is to use mnemonic phrases: 
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:06:12
Excuses excuses. There's no secondary market for fungibility and that's a fact.
Your altcoin has a serious flaw where it has has degraded scalability (full nodes must store the perpetually growing transaction output set) in order to get the privacy it has. Degraded scalability means less security. There's no point having a private coin if its security is bad enough that it gets attacked and destroyed. Why not take that argument to its logical conclusion and just use digicash, which is perfectly private and fungible on an information-theory level, but is also completely centralized and therefore has no security at all.

No, once it's mined into a block it's all the same.
The network has confirmed your transaction, it's coinbase.com that's the problem at this point. I'd say you need to contact them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:36:10
I believe this is what would happen in that situation:
You pay into a payment channel with the other guy. The other person's wallet only needs to provide a pubkey (which is free). The initial state of the payment channel is 0 to you and 0.01btc to the other guy.
Once the transaction confirms the other person can immediately spend those funds via LN.

Currencies can be investments too, many people especially in less developed countries use hard currencies like USD or EUR as an investment because their own local currency.
Bitcoin has desirable properties for this use case: any amount can be stored safely encrypted on paper, it cannot be debased, it has no storage cost and is easy to hide. And it can be sent anywhere in the world over the internet without being blocked or seized. See: 
Bitcoin is a currency today. Yes the volatility has costs but for many use cases those costs are worth it. For example if you want to [donate]( to wikipedia or thepiratebay without giving up your ID then bitcoin is the only way to do that, regardless of volatility. Anyway, historically the volatility has been falling and this will probably continue.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:34:28
Yes if people store bitcoins incorrectly they will lose them. If you store coins correctly then nobody can take them from you no matter what, no matter how good the excuse.

Better would be to have a cold storage wallet setup, where you have an offline computer that holds your private keys.
Everyone shills hardware wallets but they have their own downsides too. Cold storage wallets and multisignature wallets are as good.
Your setup doesn't contain a full node, so right now you're trusting some other server to verify that your bitcoins are real. Also that server can spy on you because it sees all your bitcoin addresses.

In order to retain their privacy, whales (and everyone) should click the "Generate New Deposit Address" button for each deposit. Then the destination will always be unknown. Also large transfers could be split up into smaller pieces each with a new deposit address, and then they wouldn't raise as many alarms with a tracker like this.

Yes indeed, multisignature storage can be very strong. With it the malware or hacker would need to infect all your machines at once.
One negative issue with Electrum is it's a lightweight wallet, so it doesn't verify the rules of bitcoin which means somebody could slip you fake bitcoins, also the Electrum servers know what all your bitcoin addresses are so they could spy on you.

It's one of the rules of bitcoin. Wallets will verify all the rules of bitcoin before accepting a transaction. If somebody created a transaction that broke the rules (e.g. created millions of bitcoins out of nothing) then such a transaction would be rejected and not displayed to wallet users, who would not trade any goods or services in return.


The original creator of bitcoin didn't elaborate much about his reasoning, but it's probably because of the fact that bitcoin is a decentralized system and without a controlled currency supply there would need to be a trusted third party to decide on the supply.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:27:03
The mining difficulty readjusts every 2016 blocks (about two weeks) with the aim to keep blocks 10 minutes apart. Every 4 years the amount of new bitcoin created per block halves. So in the beginning inflation was 50btc per block, then it became 25btc and today it's 12.5btc per block.

In terms of centralizing miners, I'm hearing good news about the end of Bitmain's dominance. Other companies are giving them stiff competition.
In my view the major problem with that idea is requiring miners to identify themselves, at least with a location that users need to send their transactions to. A major point of the peer-to-peer network is to create a private and DOS-resistant way for unconfirmed transactions and blocks to be passed around. To cast it in terms of saving money, miners adopting this would have to invest much more in DOS-resistance.

Compare that to scaling on-chain which can't get even a small fraction of that amount, and can't do it without completely destroying decentralization.
@_date: 2018-09-18 09:24:52
The most important part of a full node is to use it for verifying incoming transactions. So if you only have an incoming transaction a couple of times a week and turn on your node for that, then it useful.

Why would you want mining pools to have a web presence? Ideally all mining would be done anonymously.
We don't know for sure, but you can protect yourself by using an updated full node wallet when receiving transactions.
BlueMatt probably just asked the mining pool operators.
I agree with you that it's concerning that updating amongst full nodes has been pretty slow.

BitcoinXT is not just an alternative implementation, it has different consensus rules essentially being a whole new network and cryptocurrency. (To add to the chaos, it uses the same address format and tcp port number)

Yes stealth addresses would be great for this, it's probably all they're good for.
However stealth addresses have a few downsides: They either require you to store the entire transaction index on disk, or you have to outsource the searching to a third party who can completely ruin your privacy. There are ideas for non-outsourcable addresses.
Also getting any new address type adopted is very hard (p2sh took years) and name "stealth address" is needlessly political. Can you imagine coinbase telling their regulators they just implemented this thing called stealth addresses. A better one might be "reusable donation address".
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:13:54
Nope, coinbase.com, bitpay, kncminer and all the others who openly support BitcoinXT and want to hardfork the blockchain to create something different.
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:47:10
They number between 200k and 400k according to this:  So pretty rare compared to other types of p2sh and multisig, but not absolutely rare. They also go back way before the development of LN. 2of2 multisig have an application as a two-factor wallet, where both your computer and smartphone wallet need to approve to make a transaction happen.
And as mentioned before, we don't know they are 2of2 multisig until the channel closes.
Lastly, if schnorr signatures get soft forked into bitcoin and adopted, then 2of2 multisig will look exactly the same as a regular single-sig transaction. This will be excellent for privacy and fungibility, and is a big reason why many are excited about schnorr.

How about donating to some cool bitcoin open source projects and other common infrastructure that the ecosystem benefits from.
* [Bitsquare/Bisq]( - Decentralized fiat/btc exchange. This could become essential if governments try to make bitcoin illegal.
* r/bitcoin mods. They clean up a lot of a spam and keep the subreddit readable.
* [JoinMarket]( - Improved bitcoin privacy with coinjoin. (Disclaimer: I develop for this project)
* Electrum servers. Essential for the functioning of one of the best bitcoin wallets, many of these servers accept donations.
@_date: 2015-12-20 14:32:17
If you collect donations on a web page you can generate a new address for each loading of the donation page. thepiratebay does this so have a look at them. The idea is you get a BIP32 wallet, upload the master public key to the server and use it to generate addresses, keep the master private key backed up and use it to generate the private keys required to spend the money.
For collecting donations on a static page (e.g. a QR code printed out somewhere) there is unfortunately no private solution right now.
For collecting **payments** you just send a new address to each customer along with their invoice, that problem is solved.

It depends on your situation. In fairness an unconfirmed transaction can usually be easily reversed until its confirmed.
I've always imagined blocksonly could work well with layer-2 tech, since you only have to watch for the channel openings and closings, and you're always waiting for 3 confirmations or so anyway.

Bisq's way of operating (incentive structure, multisig escrow, security deposits, etc) goes a very long way to fixing that.
Plus with Bisq you only need to reveal your ID to your counterparty (if you're using bank transfer for example), not to the entire exchange or any blockchain analysis spying companies they are partnered with.

People will open payment channels only once or twice, once the channels are open they can transact with anyone on the lightning network via routed payments.


These nodes with a high degree are actually really hard, because they have to put up a lot of bitcoins for liquidity which has a high opportunity cost. It's much more efficient to structure the graph as a scale-free network. A kind of mesh network. See this talk for lots more details:  with the transcript:

BTC doesn't require more and more bandwidth, it requires a constant amount of bandwidth: at maximum about 2MB every 10 minutes. Thats only about 288 MB/day which is not very much at all.
You might be thinking about initial blockchain synchronization, which is where a newly-started bitcoin node must download the entire blockchain from the beginning and verify that it follows all the rules. That does get more and more costly as the blockchain grows by a maximum of about 2MB every 10 minutes.
Bitcoin nodes don't use more and more energy, not much more than any other application running on computers anyway. (You might be thinking of mining, but that's something different, and the energy usage there is bounded too)

Well that doesn't really make sense for cash trades. Cash-by-mail doesn't have an online banking web page.

Alternatively you could receive bitcoins on that payment channel too, not just send them.
So for example if your payment channel is depleted then you put $10 into a bitcoin ATM, the ATM sends you the bitcoins via LN and now your payment channel has a balance of $10 worth of btc. No need to make any new channels.

Electrum Personal Server is an implementation of the Electrum wallet server protocol that allows users to point their Electrum wallet at their own full node. 
It is an implementation of the Electrum server protocol which fulfills the specific need of using the Electrum wallet backed by a full node, but without the heavyweight server backend, for a single user. It allows the user to benefit from all of Bitcoin Core's resource-saving features like pruning, blocksonly and disabled txindex. All of Electrum's feature-richness like hardware wallet integration, multisignature wallets, offline signing, seed phrases and so on can still be used, but connected only to the user's own full node.
This release 0.1.4 makes the server work with Bitcoin Core 0.17, which deprecates the accounts feature.

No idea, but if that is a concern you should just BTCPay instead.

The risk of wallets like Electrum can be dramatically reduced by using the multisignature wallet feature.
A multisignature wallet is one where multiple private keys are required to move the bitcoins instead of a single key. These private keys can be spread across multiple machines with the assumption that malware and hackers are unlikely to simultaneously infect all of them.

The hardware wallet node also learns his IP address, which can be easily linked to his real name.
They are probably required to keep all customer data for 5 years, depending on the jurisdiction. So far from being unlikely, it's almost certainly happening already.

Full node wallets are essential to the health of the bitcoin network. The linked thread goes deep into the then-new `blocksonly` mode of Bitcoin Core which can drastically reduce the bandwidth usage of full nodes.

Satoshi probably wanted fees to be low to start with to help bootstrap the currency. (Although his intentions are irrelevant, he's been gone for years)


Unfortunately a large number of blockchain transactions is not scalable. Imagine a world where A and B want to transact, and every single node in the network has to hear about it. Broadcasting transactions does not scale. This is why bitcoin will probably move to a routing algorithm like lightning where only A and B and the nodes between them will hear.
Also, having large block sizes increases the incentive for miners to be physically close to each other because large blocks take longer to transmit. Taken to the extreme, this incentive would end will all miners on one rack in a server farm somewhere.
Big blocks also increase the initial synchronization time that new nodes have to go through. Without enough full nodes the network is not decentralized and would give complete freedom for the miners to change the rules like lifting the 21m money supply cap.
Lastly, bigger blocks make the selfish mining problem much worse.

Bisq is surely one of the top 5 most important open source projects in bitcoin today.
The privacy point is sometimes overlooked; if every single one of your bitcoin trades requires handing over your ID documentation then you have **absolutely no privacy** even if technology like CT, Dandelion, Coinjoin, Coinswap, Lightning, etc etc became widely adopted in bitcoin.
Recently we saw that Localbitcoins.com and Shapeshift were forced to require ID documentation for trading on them under certain conditions. This was a big change, I remember a time when you could go to a new city and place your own ad on localbitcoins. If you set a favourable price you could usually convert your bitcoins into local currency pretty quickly in a permissionless and anonymous fashion. No more now that localbitcoins.com requires ID documents to place ads. Of course it's not their fault, just the basic fact that centralized entities are central points of failure that can be easily squeezed and censored. Decentralized projects like Bisq are crucial for defending bitcoin's privacy and fungibility, and to keep bitcoin usable by unbanked people.

As someone who takes no notice of altcoins, if Cryptsy goes down are there other places to trade altcoins? What is their volume like?
I'm reminded of this post about Cryptsy causing the failure of an altcoin because it was the only significant source of liquidity. 
Unless I'm wrong, it seems to me bitcoin is special from them because the exchange ecosystem is actually fairly well decentralized so the failure of one single exchange doesn't cause too much of a drop of liquidity. There's also ATMs, otc sites like localbitcoins, mycelium trader and bitbargain. There are also actually places to spend bitcoin: on gift cards, ATMs, sites like pizzaforcoins, cryptothrift, DNMs, freelancers, etc
None of this seems to be true for litecoin, ethereum, dogecoin, monero, dash, peercoin, etc etc. So I predict if Cryptsy goes down for good like gox it will cause a long term bear market in their price. Okay litecoin is in a slightly better position since it has BTC-E, OKCoin and a few others supporting it.

Running a full node is the only way you can use bitcoin in a trustless way. You will know for sure that all the rules of Bitcoin are being followed, for example that no Bitcoins are spent not belonging to the owner, that no inflation happens outside of the schedule and that all the rules needed to make the system work (e.g. difficulty) are followed. Full nodes are currently the most private way to use bitcoin, with no nobody else learning which bitcoin addresses belong to you. Full nodes are the most secure way to use bitcoin, they do not suffer from many attacks that effect lightweight wallets.

You can use a hardware wallet to store the private keys, but have it be backed by a full node. Then you get the safety benefits of the hardware wallet with the security and privacy benefits of the full node.

Unfortunately this can't work indefinitely because it introduces centralization pressure. The everyone-relays-everything model doesnt scale, luckily we can create off-chain solutions on top of the blockchain that use smart contracts to create transactions which route instead of flood.

I guess because of the network effect; if you wanted to trade bitcoins almost anywhere in the world you would look on localbitcoins. So when the screws tightened and they were forced to add ID requirements then a lot of people simply carried on using them, because the network was already so developed.
So it will take a bit of work to build up a similar network on Bisq, but it should happen eventually because Bisq has something special that localbitcoins can never have.
@_date: 2018-09-21 15:04:49
Not "excessive". Optimization is very important in bitcoin, the full nodes already use a lot of resources and it's important that they are cheap to run.
You can have code thats "good enough", yet only runs on big centralized datacenters leaving bitcoin with zero security.
Maybe if we'd soft-forked the block size limit down to 300kb then such optimizations wouldn't be necessary. If we're going to engage in finger-pointing then the "scale at all costs" crowd has to bare some of the responsibility for creating that pressure.
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:45:56
Right, though I see an important difference with regular digital notes. For notes, The issuer could one day turn around and refuse to redeem them for real bitcoins. You may be able to publicly audit the issuer's reserves to stop them running a fractional reserve but that may be pointless if they turn out to be fraud that just runs off with all the bitcoins.
With these smart contract agreement it's impossible for that to happen. I think that's a crucial distinction.
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:19:58
You realise that *anything* in bitcoin can be done by hardforking? Including taboos such as raising the 21m limit or spending other people's bitcoins. There's a very good reason to fear hardforks, especially ones forced through by populist tactics ("lets plan for success", as if others plan for failure) and emotional reasoning ("censorship!", as if you don't have your own subs to go to.)
And don't give me reasoning like *"bitcoiners will never accept the 21m limit being raised"*. Just because right now the community is filled with goldbug libertarians doesn't mean it will always be like this as adoption grows.
I want to be able to trust my money to not change every few months. If I wanted money who's properties changed at the whim of democracy and populism, I would stick with central-bank-controlled currency.

BTW, lightning would not have any blockchain explorers since it doesn't have a blockchain. Payments are routed from sender to receiver, rather than broadcast to everyone. This is more private as you might imagine. And less resources intensive/cheaper. And scales much better.
You know that when you're sending a payment in lightning, you're sending to a bitcoin address. Lightning transactions are bitcoin transactions, they are just not mined into the blockchain immediately but use some smart contract magic so they can be trusted without mining.

I'd say use your node as a wallet. This would mean that the bitcoin blockchain tokens actually get more value and liquidity. Bitcoin is more complex than bittorrent where it's as simple as "uploading is good".
Running a node yourself means that you're sure you're using the right network, that no Electrum server, SPV server or web wallet can lie to you or spy on you, and make you use some fake ghost bitcoin.
One easy (kinda) way to do this is to run an Electrum server on the same machine and have your Electrum wallet connect only to it. That way you get the nice interface and features of Electrum with the trustlessness, privacy and security of a full node.

Firstly, blockchain synchronization is often limited by CPU speed and disk read speed, not bandwidth. You can try to speed it up by increasing the database cache `-dbcache=2000` for example.
Secondly, there are more nodes than 5000. That is only the number of nodes that upload blocks and are needed to bootstrap new users. Nobody knows how many nodes run which do not upload but still contribute to bitcoin's value and liquidity. I run two such nodes.

The real problem with tech like Monero is the scalability tradeoff. Monero full nodes will get progressively harder and harder to run much faster than bitcoin, and eventually the system will stop being trustless.
By-default privacy would be great if possible. (Indeed bitcoin already has a fair amount of by-default privacy. If you just check out a random transaction on a blockchain explorer its not easy to figure out who the sender and receiver both are without extra information)

The original bitcoin-qt had a bug which allowed an unlimited number of bitcoins to be created. Satoshi fixed it and had the blockchain rolled back a few hours. So no, the 21m limit was not set since the beginning.
But whether something was set at the beginning or added after is irrelevant. What's important is that bitcoin needs both those limits to work and have desirable properties like decentralization, censorship resistance and monetarily sovereignty.

This guy six months ago said the usability was pretty good: 
I've been using it a bit and the interface seems OK to me.
There is the user experience issue with the security deposits. In an anonymous system anybody could easily flood or DOS the entire network, so to make offers or conduct trades both sides need to lock up a bit of coins in multisig addresses. That makes it more complicated than fancy centralized exchanges because they know everyone's real name so they can easily ban flooders.

Yes that's correct. The two blockchain forks would be two different cryptocurrencies, with an added confusion that they use the same address format and same tcp port. Since currencies get much of their value from the network effect which goes as N^2, if you split bitcoin into two equal-sized currencies (what BitcoinXT proposes) the value should go down by a factor of four.
Me and a few others have come up with ways to trade the two currencies before a fork ever happens, it would be a nice way to tell what the economic majority thinks without actually forking. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 17:06:44

Have you heard about coinswap?  It may blow your mind.
It's another kind of smart contract that does a similar thing. You could create the smart contract script and make it so that both sides cannot fail to get paid. Meaning if either side breaks the agreement, the last resort is the smart contract script. But then **you don't actually have to execute** the smart contract, people will follow it anyway because there's no point defecting. A bit like how people will follow the law even though the police and judges don't enforce the law at every possible situation and deal.

Today it's the block size. Tomorrow it will be the 21m money supply limit.
Both are protocol rules, both are enforced by the economic majority via full nodes. Dramatically raising any of them goes again the spirit of a decentralized, censorship resistant, monetarily sovereign digital cash.
We already know that Coinbase.com invades the privacy of it's customers, we know they track bitcoin flows and damages the fungibility of bitcoin. They do not have the interests of the bitcoin community at heart, compromised as they are by having to follow state regulations.
I'd be happy to see a ban on Coinbase.com here (although in an open internet, it's very difficult to censor something) as well as not recommending them to newbies.

This can go a long way to beating those IP-address-scanning sybil attackers like Chainalysis.
I wonder if this could be used to implement CoinJoin for Bitcoin Core too. Set -walletbroadcast=0 and get the tx hex, extract from it the inputs and outputs, create a coinjoin from that information and broadcast it. The GUI might show an odd double spend attempt but the coinjoin tx will win because the non-coinjoin was never broadcast.
Now gettransaction requires a txid, how does the third-party script know which txid it should query? Through -walletnotify being fired maybe?

They can't be free. Proof of work mining is costly and must be paid for somehow. Right now it's paid for by monetary inflation but that can't last forever. The plan was always for bitcoin to transition into paying for proof of work through transaction fees.
Luckily if you use a payment channel built on top of the blockchain, you could have transactions at a much lower cost and still retain all the bitcoin properties of a decentralizated, censorship resistant digital cash.

Choose a low fee and just wait for your transaction to confirm.

What you're describing is the **bias towards the measurable**.

@_date: 2015-12-29 19:15:00
Overly-large blocks provide a strong incentive for miners to be physically close to each other, to reduce the propagation time of blocks. It would end with all mining power being on one shelf in a data center somewhere.
Also, overly-large blocks make it more difficult to bootstrap new full nodes, who need to download and verify the entire history of all bitcoin transactions. If this incentive got too strong, the number of full nodes enforcing the economic majority would drop enough that miners could print any number of new bitcoins they wanted and cause other havoc.
Sure you can let the emotional hot-button of "free market" convince you, but a perfectly possible free market solution is that bitcoin dies or becomes something worthless if we're not careful.
@_date: 2015-12-28 01:04:43

Actually with JoinMarket you're most likely to mix with clean, untainted bitcoins because of the incentives.
Normal legitimate investors in bitcoin just want to earn their coinjoin fee, they probably bought their coins from Coinbase.com and only want to earn an extra few % over time. It's a very low risk way of earning an income from your bitcoins.

This is very similar to what I use, and I'm fully-sighted. It's perfectly secure as long as your offline computer really is isolated from the internet. Cold storage is as secure (or more secure) than hardware wallet, just cold storage is a bit harder to use.
I think the hardest part about using bitcoin as a blind person is checking that bitcoin addresses are correct, since the machine voice that reads them out will have to say stuff like "one, capital L, lowercase g, capital W, etc etc etc" and it might be a bit difficult. 
Also you need a way to securely store the seed phrase words, since I assume you can't write them down with pencil and paper? Maybe you can write them in braille? How are you storing them now.

1. One doesn't *simply* softfork (Edit: i accidently wrote hardfork here). It's takes a lot of programming and politicking to convince miners that it's in their best interests to upgrade.
2. Limiting the block size goes against the miner's interests. With larger blocks they can fit more transactions inside and therefore earn more fees. So it wont happen. The cost of larger blocks is paid for by full nodes and the network as a whole, the miners have got a direct reasons to care enough to softfork the size downwards.

Miners don't define what consensus is. Full nodes, holders and users do.

Right now BitcoinJ uses SPV but someone has found a way to spy on that wallet.  The reason is that lying consistently is hard. For example if you make a payment to an address along with a change address, your SPV wallet will only track the change address. Make a few payments and its easy to see which address is change and which is output, thereby uncovering which addresses belong to the wallet.

That's not correct. Bitcoin's *history* is determined by the miners, but all the other rules about inflation-only-according-to-schedule and no-double-spending are enforced by the economy majority using full nodes. Miners work for holders in securing their transactions.
I understand what you mean by the bitcoin model not necessarily solving populism, but it can still help. We can make the topic of a controversial hard fork so taboo that nobody ever attempts it. I think it's well worth arguing against ideas like this where people believe that [yearly hard forks are a good idea](
Have you ever talked to non-bitcoiners? A common question that come up is *"How can this 21m limit thing be secure? Can't the developers just rewrite the software to create more bitcoins?"*, when you start to explain economy majority and full nodes so much you realise that hard forks should be **very** rare, preferably only for technical reasons like the March 2013 accidental fork.

BitcoinXT could fracture the network in two. If bitcoin's value goes as the network effect, splitting the network in two equal pieces should reduce it's value by a factor of four.

This was written in 2011 before widespread understanding of payment channels. Now we know that we don't need to issue digital notes that represent bitcoins, we can use smart contracts instead. They can guarantee that the value has been transfered without having to commit it to the blockchain. If you chain these payment channels together you can route payments through the network instead of flooding them, which is far more scalable. This is what people mean when they talk about the Lightning Network.
In this way we can have both, a "high-powered money" used as an investment vehicle and reserve currency as well as a day-to-day payment system. With the payment system having all the properties of decentralization and trustlessness that the underlying money has.
As for the charges of "vaporware", you'll always get naysayers. Back in 2014 when I wrote about the [idea of JoinMarket]( there were a small minority of people who said it would never be done and they'll believe it when they see it (which can be a fair enough objection, there are plenty of ideas floating around that nobody ever implements). 12 months later and [JoinMarket works]( ready at any moment to improve the privacy of your bitcoin transactions without needing to trust any single third party. Yes it is somewhat difficult to use right now, and there's a lot of things that need to be done, but the situation slowly improves and we always welcome new contributors (you get a share of the bitcoins donated to the project)

A year or two delay doesn't matter much when you're planning for the next 20 or 30 years. I really don't see the urgency, bitcoin is still a software project in beta that got adopted real quick.
Lightning doesnt need consensus like bitcoin hardforks do. For lightning you don't need to convince every single bitcoin full node to upgrade before you can even start. It can start small and grow on it's own.
Luckily after the UTXOs are locked up in payment channels, they can be used for thousands or tens of thousands of transactions without paying any miner fees.

I don't know what you mean. Adam Back did indeed invent hashcash, he is cited in the paper 


Well the time someone has been involved in bitcoin isn't a guarantee of anything. [This guy has been involved for years and years and he doesn't understand some of the most fundamental ways that bitcoin works.](
At the core developers dinner, they were asked why they like bitcoin. The other devs started talking about monetary sovereignty and so on, while Gavin said *"when I make a bitcoin payment, I feel good"*. Which is nice for him but shows that he has a different vision for bitcoin than many of us. I'm personally not interested in another Visa or Paypal, and nor should you be.






Well you can read his email on the mailing list where this is explained. He's talking about how a hostile hard fork could lead to consensus failure where two blockchains live on for months and cause havoc until people lose confidence in the system.


I reject the idea that the community supports a hard fork. Maybe if you stay in your echochamber that is true, but many of the anti-XT people do not take part in the debate anymore because they know that XT has failed and there's not much to worry about.


Well, it is controversial. I know you would say that it should not be controversial but it is. I certainly don't want the BitcoinXT gigablocks and I'm confident the economy majority agrees with me.


It's not me that imposed this condition, this is how the system technically works. If it did not there would be no reason to trust other sacred parameters like the 21m limit.


Well soft forks can usually be rejected by the economy majority.


Loads of stuff is used differently to how they were intended. Do you know the sequence number and nLockTime fields in transactions? They are used completely differently today to how satoshi designed them.


Destroying the community was started by the populist and emotional tactics of Gavin and Mike. I imagine many of the XT supporters will become disillusioned and eventually leave the bitcoin community, but that's ok. It will lead to a more stable situation where developers can work without being pestered by forum sockpuppets (we've already sadly lost gmaxwell though.)
You realise XT will never happen? When will you give up? Can't you go to or something and leave us alone. (Or support the conclusions of the Scaling Bitcoin conference like everyone else, but I doubt that will happen. Too much bad feelings and emotion has been throw around)

It's very similar to how it works on localbitcoins.com exchange. The bitcoins are held in escrow (2of3 multisig escrow) and the fiat currency is transacted normally (via bank transfer, SEPA, cash face-to-face, cash-by-mail, or any other method). Then the bitcoins are released from escrow if all went well. You could say Bisq is like a decentralized localbitcoins.com that is hard to shut down or censor.

Monero's on-chain transaction volume is less than 100x smaller than bitcoin's. So I wouldn't say there's any evidence of it taking over on the dark net, more likely that is Monero propaganda.

@_date: 2018-08-18 17:03:22
Bulletsproofs don't change the inherent unscalability. Monero full nodes must store all TXOs, it does not know whether a TXO has been spent like in bitcoin, so it can never prune them.
Lightweight client options have security tradeoffs. Bitcoin defending against the miners with UASF was only possible because people didn't use SPV wallets but full nodes.
Money has a network effect. Long-term there can only be one (as Monero is already finding out today with an on-chain transaction volume 100x smaller than bitcoin's)

Fair enough. Although even if you connect to a server over tor, that server will still know your transactions and most addresses, and is able to link them together in one wallet. Tor just stops the server knowing your IP address. So yes tor helps but the privacy is still pretty bad with public servers.

I'm saying how Monero is less scalable and therefore less decentralized and ultimately less secure.
Your own OP talks about how important decentralization is, yet Monero completely gives that up. Also right now Lightning Network (from your own OP) can't work on Monero.
The fact is that Monero's on-chain transaction volume is two orders of magnitude less than bitcoin. Bitcoin's network effect is stronger and that's why we see even darknet merchants, ransomware operators and scammers still ask for bitcoin *not* monero or any altcoin.
It's funny how on the one hand you say "bitcoin mixers are bad because drug dealers use them" and on the other hand say "Monero is great because drug dealers can use it" (which they don't notably as the transaction volume shows)

51% of miners can reorganize the entire chain back to any depth. That's what I mean when I say your proposal degrades the security by adding more trust with the miners.
Miners could reorganize back very deeply and create new transactions that award themselves infinite bitcoins. Those transactions then get fully-spent and pruned, and new "pruned nodes" would then accept them as valid as they won't see the fraud.

Reddit is not Sybil-resistant, it's easy to create 490 accounts and vote. That's a big reason why Luke went to the trouble to make that poll.
Stepping back a bit, I'm not sure what you're trying to prove. Miners obviously lost their nerve and caved in when they saw the UASF movement. You can try to prove that the UASF movement was all fake, but it's too late now that we have segwit.

1. The words "regular/legacy" are a bit confusing in this context. It might be better called "p2sh-wrapped-segwit". But the rest this point is correct. Also added that native segwit uses bech32-format addresses.
2. Yes. For example in native segwit P2WPKH the scriptPubKey is `"0014" + pubKeyHash`, that is encoded into bech32 format to get the address. In p2sh-wrapped-segwit, the redeemScript of the p2sh address is `"0014" + pubKeyHash` and that redeemScript is converted into a P2SH address like any other redeemScript. So in both cases the script `"0014" + pubKeyHash` is made.

Bisq can replace every trading method that makes use of escrow. But localbitcoins also used to be good for putting up adverts to trade btc at a cash meetup. You don't need escrow when trading bitcoin for cash at a physical meetup, especially in a bitcoin ecosystem where LN is getting more and more advanced, which allows instant payments to somebody without waiting for confirmations.
So part of the localbitcoin replacement should just be a simple noticeboard website where people can place adverts and their phone number for cash trading meetups. That would allow mostly-anonymous cash trading. That's all gone now with localbitcoins requiring your ID information to place even cash trade adverts.

It is to help mitigate the damage eclipse attacks.
Eclipse attacks are when a node is partitioned away from the rest of the network. For example an ISP could easily do this. One thing an eclipse attacker could do feed their own fake blocks to the node, even if they only have about 0.5% hash power that would be enough to steal all the node's money by reversing transactions. The long 2016 retarget interval requires such an attacker to expend much more mining power. That's also why Bitcoin Core gives warnings if blocks stop appearing for a long time, it's also why the difficulty can at maximum change upwards or downwards by a factor of 4.

Off-chain solutions still require on-chain transactions. LN needs to the blockchain to open and close payment channels.
If your single on-chain transaction contains hundreds of thousands or millions of actual economic transactions then it becomes totally rational to pay $5 in miner fees. More efficient transactions will make miner's total income go up, not down, because of [Jevon's paradox](

When people get paid with gold or banknotes, they usually check that those are actually genuine. In the same way Bitcoin full nodes check that received bitcoins are real genuine bitcoins. For bitcoins long term survival most of the bitcoin economy must use full nodes as their wallets.

The standard nomenclature is "best chain". That is the term used in dev discussions and in the bitcoin code source code e.g. the RPC procedure called `getbestblockhash`. Even "most work" chain doesn't cover it since it has to be valid.

I think that definition is consistent with my argument. Let's go back to the original point about user activated soft forks.
If the bitcoin economic majority updates it's full nodes to software that implements a user-activated-soft-fork, then through incentives the miners will quickly decide to not mine any blocks that are invalid from the point of view of that soft fork, in the same way that those 50btc-post-halvening-miners also quickly stopped, or in the same way that miners don't mine an infinite number of bitcoins today.

Some models run their own full nodes. Just by inertia those would support the already-existing Core chain.
@_date: 2017-02-23 16:09:35
Ultimately the bitcoin economy decides the rules of bitcoin by using full node wallets. If a miner creates an invalid block (for example, after the first halvening some miners continued creating 50btc per block) then those coins will be rejected by the economy in the same way a careful goldsmith rejects fool's gold.
Currently bip9 waits for the miners to signal, but that is being abused for political reasons to try to extract concessions from the economy. Also bip9 fails in its stated purpose of making sure miners have upgraded, the bip66 accidental fork showed that miners are happy to signal and then not actually enforce the new rules.
A flag-day-activated soft fork is when the bitcoin economy decides to start enforcing the new rules on a particular day (or block height). It will work and be safe as long as the economy supports the flag day soft fork and publicly tells everyone so everybody knows.
Miners who don't want to upgrade straight away only need to avoid mining invalid blocks. They can do this with a guard node and then upgrade in their own time (or never, if they want to leave fee money on the table)
Note that segwit-spending transactions are non-standard and so won't be relayed. So it's not possible for anyone out there to make a non-upgraded miner mine an invalid block, the miner himself must add the invalid transaction to their block which would start a fork similar to the bip66 situation. The incentives are asymmetric in that the segwit-invalid fork could be wiped out in a reorg if the segwit-valid fork ends up with more work, which is what happened to the bip66-invalid chain and was very expensive to the miners that took part.
If a fork does happen (which is likely to be by accident rather than for profit, given that we assume the economy supports segwit) then lightweight wallets could be in danger. So it would be helpful to promote the idea that lightweight wallet users should wait for many more confirmations than normal (which really they should do anyway, confirmations in a lightweight wallet are much weaker in terms of security anyway)
A flag day soft fork could be combined with a bip9 soft fork i.e. "segwit becomes a consensus rule when miner signalling reaches 95% OR after block height XXXXXX, whichever happens first". It's possible the miners could just activate with bip9 once they realize their political games won't achieve anything.

Use `getnewaddress` to get a receive address, then `getreceivedbyaddress` to find if and how much money arrived.
See  or use `./bitcoin-cli help`
You can use `-blocknotify` or [the zmq interface]( if you want bitcoin to tell you when a new block was mined so you can check if your received bitcoins have the required number of confirmations.

Just like the theory of gravity then.
Larger blocks put a higher cost onto full nodes, if the bitcoin economy isn't largely backed by full node wallets then bitcoin stops being a low-trust currency.


Bitcoin is made so holders as a group have a lot of power, you can't disregard them.


Nobody is saying they can be entirely disregarded. But fact is that in bitcoin miners don't decide on the validity rules, they only decide the ordering and history of transactions.

Quite frankly it doesn't matter what Satoshi said. He is not our Jesus and the whitepaper isn't our bible. Its a fact that without a large portion of the bitcoin economy using full nodes the miners can inflate the money supply and confiscate coins. Bitcoin needs full nodes to be as easy as possible to run or else it loses its fundamental value proposition.
I agree with you about raising the block size, that's why I'm hoping segwit activates as soon as possible which does this safely.
It's weird that the anti-core crowd was asking for a 2mb hard fork with Bitcoin Classic just 9 months ago, and now that segwit is ready and waiting you suddenly don't want it. It makes me think you're not arguing in good faith and just want to stall and attack bitcoin because you hate the core developers for some reason.

If miners don't activate segwit, the economy can activate it using a flag day.
I've written about how this here: 
@_date: 2017-02-17 22:21:30
Well that ROI can't be funded by miner income, since bitcoin inflation will be just 4% and falling. The bitcoin price might go up but miners will benefit from it less and less.
So sorry but we can't put off moving to a high miner fee era anymore. If the anti-Core side would stop blocking segwit then we could get cheap instant transactions and that would be great.
@_date: 2017-02-05 19:22:15
Core prioritizes off-chain solutions mainly because they preserve decentralization.
The anti-Core's vision would absolutely be the death of a decentralized low-trust bitcoin. They started off advocating block sizes of 8GB(!) Gavin and Mike openly said they thought only massive datacenters should run full nodes, introducing trust into the system and allowing miners to confiscate coins or print as many btc as they wanted.
@_date: 2017-02-09 12:48:33
That's no compromise, it requires a hard fork. Again with your "hard-fork-at-all-costs" BS.
I think if you look over at r/btc you'll see plenty of people talking about "firing the core devs" and "blockstream core are holding back bitcoin" and other such.
You know you CAN hard fork today. You can take your 20% BU mining power and create your own little economy. But you obviously don't want that, you want everyone else in bitcoin to follow you which simply won't happen.

Miners and developers can do what they want, and make whatever deals they want, but the true power is with the economy backed by full node wallets.

That's not right. Segwit is not linked only to Core. The other lightning implementation (lnd) uses the segwit-compatible clients btcd, and the currently agreed protocol between all implementors of lightning assumes segwit has activated. In practice, blocking segwit is blocking LN.
Perhaps also header's first synchronization, libsecp256k1, schnorr signatures, MAST, weak blocks, transaction cut-through and anything else I've forgotten. It's a long list so you could just replace it all with "Core Scaling Roadmap" :)

If only you'd educate yourself about how LN and segwit worked, they are nothing like a bank. They preserve all the low-trust properties of bitcoin's blockchain.

Bitcoin is completely voluntary. If you don't want to use it then leave. Stop trying to force everyone else onto your alternative BU client.
Actually the 95% is just signalling, what's important is support from the bitcoin economy which segwit has: 
That's a list of more than 100 bitcoin exchanges, services and projects. Including big names like localbitcoins, coinbase.com and BitGo (which provides wallet services to exchanges like kraken and bitstamp).
All those names on that list are ready, willing and able to support segwit. Ultimately the miners work for the economy and if they keep not signalling segwit then it's likely the economy will find a way.

There's a lot of newbs around these days so I didn't realize how long you'd been involved :)
Ultimately the bitcoin economy through full nodes decides what bitcoin is. The BIP9 method waits for the miners to signal that the soft fork should be enforced, but in theory there are ways to persuade the miners if they end up being the only ones blocking a soft fork (like now). The economy isn't helpless if the miners do something it doesn't like. On the other hand there are several more months until this BIP9 period ends so we should at least wait until then before doing anything.
@_date: 2017-02-28 00:42:01
Nobody is forcing the miners to do anything. They are free to do whatever they like. However everyone else is free to accept or reject blocks depending on whether they follow the rules of their cryptocurrency as they see them. Bitcoin is a completely voluntary system that runs on cryptography and markets, not force.

Escrow and consumer protection are built on top of bitcoin, they are still part of the bitcoin ecosystem. Also, if you use 2-of-3 multisig then they are not somebody else wallet, the wallet belongs to.... all three... in a weird way that the english language can't really describe yet.

It is an altcoin, because it has different consensus rules to the rest of bitcoin. In cryptocurrencies, the rules _are_ the currency.
The reason they chose not to start with a new genesis block is that they are a political project to take over bitcoin. So they could tell people that they have the same balance and history, but in reality the rules and properties of that currency are different.

The reason confiscation and extra inflation doesn't happen today is because most of the economy uses full node wallets, which verify all the rules of bitcoin. If someone tries to confiscate coins and send them to an exchange to sell, the full node of that exchange will reject those confiscated coins in the same way that a goldsmith rejects fake gold.
That's why full nodes must be decentralized and available to almost everyone. For a longer explanation see this page:

1. I don't understand how this makes bitcoin flawed. You could also argue that governments have a strong incentive to encourage innovative new technology because it improves the economy and therefore helps the government.
1. The current block size conflict is ultimately about this kind of stuff. But its worth saying that once you've done the initial blockchain synchronization, running a full node doesn't take many resources at all. There's plenty of ideas for new technology that could help solve this problem. When holding bitcoin part of the risk you take is that they might not work out, I personally think these problems can be solved so I'm holding. BTW to send $5 bitcoin long term you'd use LN instead of the blockchain.
1. What could they do? Sell them all to crash the market? Yes they could but they could only do this once. Ultimately with [Coase's theorem]( it shouldn't matter. The early adopters built all the important bitcoin infrastructure and brought the cryptocurrency into the mainstream.
1. Even if this were true, it would just mean that then bitcoin will reach stability once there's no more government currencies or totalitarian regimes existing. I think bitcoin's properties are useful enough that it might be adopted by some even if its volatility is slightly higher, there's plenty of people on this forum even today who live exclusively with bitcoin.
1. A currency doesn't have to be guaranteed by a government for people to have faith in it. Indeed many currencies lost the faith of their users even though governments tried to prop them up.

It would activate by using a flag day instead of the bip9 miner activation method. See my writeup 
In the rest of your post it looks like you're confusing a flag day soft fork with a PoW-algorithm hard fork. That's not happening, flag day soft forks don't do anything to the proof-of-work algorithm.
Nobody can force miners to do anything, that is true. But if miners want to get any kind of income they will have to create blocks that conform to the rules of bitcoin that the economy is expressing through it's use of full node wallets.

Before segwit existed, the same people who are now against it tried to force a hard fork onto bitcoin by mass-posting and voting about a hard fork client called BitcoinXT. They filled the entire front page with misleading information and mass-downvoted anybody who pointed out the lies.
In response, the mods of this subreddit instituted a new rule that promotion of altcoin clients was not allowed. It resulted in lots of pro-Bitcoin-XT accounts being banned. One of them, roger ver, purchased r/btc from the original owner, put his own employees to be the mods and made it a safe space for anti-Core talk. That group has done everything it can to be against the Core developer team, even though they have nothing to do with the moderation of this subreddit.
For some history, here is theymos's original famous thread about the new moderation rules: 
My point of view is that [good communities die by refusing to defend themselves]( BitcoinXT was an attack on bitcoin.

1) This can be solved by having a human arbitrator. Bitsquare does this with 2-of-3 multisig. Decentralized doesn't mean fully-automated.
2) The lower liquidity could be made up for with the lower counterparty risk. Decentralized exchanges can't easily handle daytraders and gamblers, but localbitcoins can't handle these users either and it seems to be doing perfectly fine. In legacy finance the currency markets work on an OTC basis and they are perfectly liquid.
I think a bigger issue holding back decentralized exchanges is they have far more trouble funding themselves. Centralized exchanges like bitstamp or localbitcoins can easily take a % of every trade. Decentralized open source projects either have to code in a % fee which could be removed or run donation drives. This is a problem many open source projects face.

The segwit-invalid blocks will be rejected by the bitcoin economy in the same way a careful goldsmith rejects fool's gold. The miners who created them will be unable to trade their bitcoins for any real goods or services. Each invalid block costs that miner about $15k at current prices.
So miners could create a chain split, but it will end in the same expensive way the accidental bip66 fork ended.
This incentive structure is the same thing that stops the miners creating more than 21m bitcoins or confiscating bitcoins without knowing the private keys.

I've corrected you on this before in this thread.
Struggling to understand why you repeat this false thing.
If miners create invalid blocks, they will not be able to sell their newly-mined coins because those coins will not be real bitcoins.

Each bitcoin actually requires a small program to spend it. For most coins, this program is simply "anyone who shows the correct digital signature may spend me". But there are some more complex scripts like "any 2 signatures corresponding to these 3 public keys may spend me" which is how 2-of-3 multisig is implemented.
Right now these scripts are visible to everyone on the blockchain. P2SH hides the script when sending but has to reveal it when the coin is spent. MAST is a way to reveal only the part of a script that's being executed.
For example, a way to implement consumer protection in bitcoin is to use multisig and timeouts. The script would be "any 2-of-2 signature/pubkey may spend me OR once the coin has existed for 30 days then this other pubkey may spend me". This would be similar to how credit cards consumer protection works, where for the first 30 days the customer and arbitrator together can charge back the money, after those 30 days the money belongs to the merchant. When that coin is spent with MAST, only one of the two statements either side of OR must be revealed. So if the merchant spends the coin they reveal "once the coin has existed for 30 days then this other pubkey may spend me" and if the customer + arbitrator spend the coin they reveal "any 2-of-2 signature/pubkey may spend me OR once the coin has existed for 30 days then this other pubkey may spend me".
So MAST improves privacy because less of the script is revealed, it improves scalability because less data is needed to be stored in the blockchain and it improves flexibility because it allows new smart contracts not possible before.

@_date: 2017-02-28 03:05:45
It is a constant, it's been in the code since 2010 which is long before most people joined the bitcoin space.
Yet people still chose to use bitcoin, that's the free market. People are free to use litecoin or any other currency.
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:59:23


If you actually ask people why they don't use full nodes, the main reason they say is that initial blockchain synchronization takes too long.


The increase in users would just be using lightweight wallets like most new users have so far.




You've forgotten to include the costs of initial blockchain synchronization. Also $5 is still too large when the alternative is a free lightweight wallet.


Bitcoin runs on incentives. The holder and the miner both have incentives and they should not be played around with just to temporarily save on miner fees and undermine security. Bitcoin is a voluntary system and if you don't like it you're free to leave (and use VISA or something else with low fees)


I don't know where this comes from, but it's complete crap. Look up Satoshi Roundtable.


Miners were always third-class citizens. You can read forum posts from 2010 or 2011 of people who understood the relationship between miners and full nodes.
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:48:07
Both require a hard fork to change. Both are necessary for bitcoin to be a valuable currency. Both are a magic number that Satoshi coded in which acts as an engineering constraint (or "central planning" as the anti-Core crowd call it)
The whitepaper also doesn't mention ECDSA or sha256, yet we're not changing them either. The whitepaper is not our bible so stop treating it as such.
The same drama that's being stirred up today for the block size will surely be stirred up for the money supply cap too one day. Perpetual inflation would also lower miner fees, so many of the same arguments used today could be applied for that too.

This doesn't solve the all problems of malleability. It can't be used to implement coinswap for example.
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:05:34


Bitcoin's security model requires that most of the economy uses full nodes, otherwise the miners can print infinite money or confiscate other people's bitcoin.
That's what the anti-core side doesn't seem to get. By taking away our ability to run full nodes, you're taking away our ability to verify the rules of bitcoin. It's like asking us to accept gold coins without being able to verify it's not fool's gold.

Ah if only privacy in bitcoin as was easy at this..
It's still possible to track transactions when using Reusable Payment Codes by sending a small amount of bitcoin to the RPC, eventually the receiver will sweep up the coins into somewhere else and you'll be able to get all kinds of information, potentially revealing their entire wallet.
So if you still need to break the link on the blockchain when using RPCs for each individual transaction; using joinmarket, tumblebit, deposit to bitcoin casino(s) and then withdraw, or one of those centralized tumblers.
Also be careful since the individual RPCs are can still be linked to your identity. I'm reminded of a case a few months ago where some cryptocurrency-stealing malware was being spread around. It also stole Monero which uses the same technology as RPCs. If you took the thief's Monero address and put it into google, it lead to someone's Monero forum signature which is obviously who wrote the malware, *"but how is this possible, monero stealth addresses are private!?!"*, well it's rarely enough to just use a certain privacy technology without understanding it.
But on the other hand, RPCs are mostly good and I don't want to take that away, just be careful and proceed with understanding.

Economic actors only count here if they use full nodes as their wallets. If a lightweight wallet user trades goods and services for bitcoin using their wallet, they could be made to accept invalid bitcoins which were confiscated from someone else or where inflated above 21 million.
After the first halvening, some miners continued mining 50 bitcoins per block. But the economic majority's full nodes did not accept those bitcoins because they considered them invalid. The miners were unable to sell their coins and quickly went back to mining 25 bitcoins per block.

If you're thinking of the lists on the Bitcoin "Classic" website, they were found to be misleading. Classic didn't even ask many of those companies if they wanted to be on that list. Plus many of them support 2MB in theory but do not support a contentious hard fork. Exchanges are not that irrational, much as Bitstamp would like to be able to track everyone's coins, I dont think they're prepared to be on the wrong side of a hardfork to achieve that.
@_date: 2016-01-24 05:20:46
No because they honestly believe it 2mb would break stuff. The 4th July accidental fork was one example of where 1mb is already causing problems. If you think a hard fork would make everyone happy you've been in some echo chamber too long, plenty of people disagree with bitcoin "classic".

He likely means full nodes that people use wallets to do economic activity. If miners want to sell their coins to these entities they must create valid blocks or else the full node wallets will reject them.

I  recommend you combine segwit and LN into the same bullet point because they are both advocated by the pro-Core side. Supporting segwit almost always means the person supports LN, and vis versa.
In fact it would be fairer to just link to Core's scaling roadmap:  which contains segwit and LN but also contains many other updates, some of which are already deployed like libsecp256k1.

Makes complete sense, Davenport's BitGo makes a lot of large transactions and is surely paying a lot in miner fees recently.
Note that BitGo provides wallet services to many large exchanges like bitstamp and kraken.
What could end up happening is BitGo will be annoyed with miner fees and will be very pro-active in activating segwit [using a flag day]( Their full node is a significant part of the bitcoin economy so they have a fair amount of influence here.

That's not a quota, that's a technical requirement. Bitcoin requires a block size limit to stay decentralized.

There are more ways to increase capacity than a hard fork.
Tell me you're actually interested in capacity, not just a political game to remove the core developers.
I don't get why the pro-hard-fork side is so hostile to segwit. It raises capacity and has a ton of other benefits. All we get are post-rationalisations like *"It's too complicated"* (Because bitcoin itself is simple right?) and *"It requires people to update"* (As if a hard fork doesn't). From what I can see, you don't like segwit because it means we don't have to hard fork.

It depends on the size of your transaction in bytes on the blockchain.

Be aware that an eavesdropper on your connection between your wallet and your node could spy on you by learning all of the addresses in your wallet.

A contentious hard fork is absolutely against the self-interest and maybe the ideology of the majority of the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2016-03-15 17:44:21
Three main reasons:
1) Trustlessness
2) Security
3) Privacy.
Trustlessness because running your own bitcoin node and using it as your wallet is the only way to know for sure that none of bitcoin's rules have been broken. Rules like no coins were spent not belonging to the owner, that no coins were spent twice, that no inflation happens outside of the schedule and that all the rules needed to make the system work are followed  (e.g. difficulty.) All other kinds of wallet involve trusting a third party server which means if the miners create infinite bitcoins, your wallet will simply go along with them.
Security because all these checks also increase the wallet's security. There are many classes of attack that don't work for full node wallets. For example, bitcoin web businesses should absolutely not use a lightweight wallet.
Privacy because full nodes involve downloading the entire blockchain and extracting your bitcoin balance from there. All other lightweight wallets leak information about which addresses are yours.
For more details see this thread [Clearing up some misconceptions about full nodes](
Note that you **only** get these benefits if you use your node as a wallet for economic activity. Running a node and never using it is pointless.

A slight compromise is impossible. You can't hardfork only a little bit.
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:51:06
Some context here:
Right now bitcoin full nodes require all unspent coins to be stored in a database. Then when a transaction happens spending coins, every full node just looks in it's database for whether the coins are truely unspent and have the correct value and so on. This is very trustless but not that scalable because every node needs a big database (which is about 2GB right now) which gets bigger as more people use bitcoin (because they create more unspent coins)
In the last year or so, there's been some serious ideas of changing this so the big database isn't needed, instead there would be some data structure which allows the spender to cryptographically prove that an unspent coin exists.

An non-verifying wallet can't know whether the bitcoin payment blocks it received are actually genuine. It must trust some third party node to tell them that.


SPV wallets *do not* verify their transactions, they trust some third party for that.


It's the same kind of thing of whether you should accept gold coins or banknotes without first verifying that they are genuine. Yes in practice you might not get much fake money floating around, but do you want to be the one left holding fool's gold?

Interesting. Since bitcoin money supply inflation is only about 4% now.
Mining is meant to be a very competitive market so profits like that shouldn't really happen. Then again your profits also involved trading the hardware itself which is distinct from the marginal mining profit.
I wonder if the profit margin of mining is higher because the added risk of all the lemon market effects of some ASIC manufacturers turning out to be scams or shipping late.

It's up to you. Most of the coinjoin volume seems to happen at amounts much less than 10-15 btc so you can take part without even too much coin.
Yes probably the safest way is to run the node from hardware in your own home or somewhere you control. Bitseeds, raspberry pi, cheap laptop or whatever.
All exchanges have to keep some coins in hot wallets, I think it's an acceptable risk if you keep your attack surface low. (e.g. don't run it from the same computer you use day-to-day which is more likely to pick up malware)

@_date: 2017-02-16 16:34:12
I don't think miners decide anything in a hard fork, if they create backward-incompatible blocks then that's the same as mining fool's gold for them. Remember bitcoin.com's 13btc mistake a few weeks ago, that was an (accidental) hard fork but they quickly got back to mining valid bitcoin blocks because of the incentives.
Perhaps there's another way the economy can influence that isn't as extreme as a PoW hard fork.

Well the same is true for the 10 minute block time, the 2 week retarget interval, the 21 million money supply limit, the 210000 reward halving interval, etc. Bitcoin has plenty of magic numbers that could be called "artificial" because bitcoin is an artificial system.

Validation is incredibly important. Unless most of the economy is backed by full node wallets, the miners will be able to print infinite bitcoins, confiscate other people's bitcoins or spend a coin twice. Widespread validation is the only thing that protects bitcoin's properties.

You say gold is traded constantly, which is true, but that doesn't make it a currency used day-to-day. It's just being shuffled around on exchanges or OTC. The pawn shop thing only further demonstrates that it's a store of value despite not being a currency.
I agree that the USD has massive liquidity and therefore stability, but I'm talking about it's purchasing power. The central bank which controls the USD has a mandate to make its purchasing power drop by 2% per year. Also, USD in a bank account is not the same as USD in cash. If we're using other financial instruments then it's perfectly possible to put bitcoin in an account somewhere and earn interest too.
Bitcoiners don't want USD, they want the things that can be bought with USD (or any currency)
So no, I'm still missing something (well I'm not, but just trying to use non-confrontational language). It's pretty clear to me that a currency needs more than lots of use day-to-day, especially when its competing with other currencies like the USD which are already have massive day-to-day volumes.

Well one way to make it larger is for someone to create an institution that sells forwards. As the institution gains trust and repuation, more bitcoin holders will feel safe enough to lend their bitcoins to it.
There may be regulatory issues too, since the institution would have to settle in USD. Though to start with perhaps it could do a transfer within an exchange, from one user account to another. So letting the exchange deal with the USD transmitting.

Core developers aren't forcing anything, it was always known that fees would overtake inflation. It's even in the whitepaper.
A more accurate picture is that big blockers are trying to force a new network consensus. They hope that miners at a 75% threshold will force every other bitcoin user to go along with their hard fork. The only reason Classic's attack even has a chance of working is that many people sadly use lightweight wallets. Classic must be rejected, miners do not rule bitcoin and it would fail if they did.

Yes, that's because they're changing the ordering of transactions there. They can only rearrange the existing transactions, not make new ones that (for example) steal your cold storage bitcoins because full nodes won't accept it.

Right. They are users in the sense that they trade, is that what you mean? I've never heard the phrase "super user" used in that way before.
On a long enough time scale and with perfect competition, miners must sell their block rewards to the economy which makes them dependent on it in a way that other bitcoin users are not. Rather than "super users" I'd call them "subordinate users"

With all due respect, none of them.
Bitcoin is a decentralized system, people should stop trying to find a "leader" or "representative".
Even if Core developers and BU people agreed on something, they don't have to power to unilaterally implement it. That power in bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies) is with the economic majority expressing it's wish through using full nodes as wallets. That's not my opinion, that's how bitcoin works on a technical level.
What's probably going to happen is after the current bip9 period of segwit ends, the bitcoin economy may choose to do a user-activated-soft-fork that activates segwit, which is not subject to a veto by the miners.
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:05:55
Bitcoin is valuable as a low-trust money which it achieves through decentralization. It's not valuable because of low fees.
Low fees can be done more efficiently in a centralized system like paypal or visa, bitcoin's blockchain can't compete there. Luckily we know about tech like LN which allows instant, very-low-fee bitcoin transactions without losing much of the low-trust properties.
Increasing the block size would damage decentralization. Attempting a contentious hard fork is also dangerous and would damage the currency.

Fair enough I shouldn't have used the second person. Sorry about that.
As for groups vs individuals. In the same way you agree about Reddiquette, I agree that people **ought** to see others on an individual basis instead of some group, but unfortunately groups and stereotyping are way more efficient when it comes to internet drama like this. When you know someone is a big-blocker or small-blocker, you can very quickly get a good idea of their opinions on many things and what kind of blog posts and threads have influenced them.
It's worth saying that far from being an individual, your posts are full of big-blocker talking points like *"moderation is censorship, downvotes are never censorship"* which is why I initially thought you were a r/btc reader.
For the hostility, I stand by that statement to any supporter of Bitcoin XT and Classic. I believe they want to destroy the things that make bitcoin valuable and unique. I don't mind telling you that I wish they'd just go away, (or change their minds and join us again [which sometimes happens](
Note that my views didn't appear fully formed, but slowly grew from nearly 9 months of block size debate. From my point of view it wasn't started by increased moderation but by Mike Hearn's and Gavin Andresen's oversimplifying and misleading blog posts, their backroom dealing and the release of their BitcoinXT alt-client in a hostile-hard-fork attempt. Increased moderation of r/bitcoin was a response to that, which in my view was legitimate.

For people who don't know about financial derivatives and why they're useful, consider this.
Imagine a shoemaker who sells shoes for bitcoins. He needs to pay his workers at the end of each month in USD. So he wants to buy a **forward contract**, which is a right to sell BTC and receive USD at a future date, but at a price fixed upon today.
Then every time the shoemaker sells some shoes, he will buy a forward contract for the same amount. At the end of the month all the forwards will expire and the shoemaker will hand over some BTC and receive USD, which he'll use to pay his workers.
Because of the forward contract, the BTC/USD exchange rate risk has moved away from the shoemaker and onto the financial institution who sold him the contract. The shoemaker focuses on his core business of making shoes, rather than his side gig of speculating on the BTC/USD exchange rate.

**Elevator Pitch for Coinjoin Users / People who desire privacy.**
With Joinmarket nobody can steal your coins, you would mix them on your own computer. The software will never sign a transaction unless your coins are going to exactly the right address in the right amount.
Other mixing services mix your coins with other users, resulting in you getting back coins possibly related to drugs, stolen money or other illegal and immoral practices. This is highly undesirable if you just don't want your employer knowing which non-profits you support from your salary. Because of the incentives of Joinmarket, you have access to a huge amount of clean, untainted bitcoins to mix with at a very low price. Many of the bitcoins you're mixing with will be bought from regulated exchanges, owned by legitimate holders of bitcoin.
Not to mention you'd likely be paying lower fees for mixing than other services, because of the competition between willing-to-wait coinjoiners. Indeed if you don't mind waiting, you can wait around with a low offer fee and maybe another impatient coinjoiner will join with you.

I know. Shares are usually traded far more than bitcoins transact on the blockchain. The miner fees would probably lead to the bid-ask spread for trading the shares to be really high. It's far more efficient to use an internal database.
Look at the exchanges used for bitcoin/fiat, none of them work on the blockchain, they are all internal databases.

Great post OP.
Does bitcoin need an interest rate to do this? Could you borrow USD, buy bitcoins and just hold them in a wallet for the duration of the forward? How do forwards for commodities work? (which don't generate a yield)
EDIT: wait I get it, to hedge useful forward contracts you need to be able to borrow BTC.
You could borrow bitcoins here:  Counterparty risk is significant for the lender, however the financial house doing this is only borrowing and could easily obtain a long-running good reputation.
So there's your business idea. Set up a website that sells forwards, build up a nice reputation to convince BTC holders to lend to you. Why aren't people doing this? Probably lack of understanding. Maybe a difficulty of buying USD bonds when your business model involves bitcoins which have an uncertain regulatory landscape, but there may be other ways of lending out USD.
Another way is to use the bitfinex exchange.
People can lend BTC on the bitfinex exchange which traders can borrow and use to go short. Right now it costs about [about 0.06% per day]( to borrow, for up to 30 days. You can sell those bitcoins on the exchange (to go short), trouble is the USD can't be taken out and used to buy USD bonds. It can only be used to cover your shorts. Not sure how relevant this is, would like your thoughts.

@_date: 2016-03-14 18:12:41


Yes, only for soft forks. Not hard forks.
Some BIPs don't even deal with consensus code, for example BIP32 which wallet developers could choose to adopt.
See the example of the March 2013 accidental hard fork where the majority of mining power was mining the wrong side. And they had to eat tens of thousands of dollars in lost revenue. We didn't go with the miners in that case.


You don't know that. For the block size issue there are plenty who are not Core developers who disagree with a hard fork, it's not obvious that they would follow if Core developers all changed their mind.
Fact is, the real power lies with the economic majority, not core developers. (In fact Core developers would probably prefer you don't go around saying they're in charge because ignorant governments or corporations might try to corrupt or arrest them)


You could but that would be strange. Miners don't have this power, one day you may find the economic majority sells all it's coins and the miners are left to mine fools gold.

The miners are free to do whatever they like. But if the economy activates segwit with a flag day then miners will have avoid mining segwit-invalid blocks if they want to make any money. Miners can opt-out of mining segwit transactions of course as is their right.
The miners work for the economy, not the other way around. A flag day activation is an acknowledgement of this basic fact.

Under the right circumstances, only the coinjoin initiator will know the mapping from inputs to output addresses. And since the coinjoin initiator just paid a fee to obtain some privacy, they have incentive not to ruin that privacy by announcing to the world.
The code is open source. If you understand python you can look at the function verify_unsigned_tx() which checks the transaction.

No, that's right.
Using a full node as your wallet is the only way to know for sure that none of bitcoin's rules have been broken. Rules like no coins were spent not belonging to the owner, that no coins were spent twice, that no inflation happens outside of the schedule and that all the rules needed to make the system work are followed (e.g. difficulty.) All other kinds of wallet involve trusting a third party server.
SPV wallets simply trust the miners, if most the economy isn't using full nodes then the miners have a strong incentive to simply print money. Remember that SPV wallets wouldn't even know the rules have been broken so would not be in a position to sell bitcoin and adopt another currency.

Absolutely, this is my view for how CoinJoin and other privacy tech will solve the fungibility problem:
Firstly, note that CoinJoin only improves fungibility if it's actually used. So could there be a tragedy-of-the-commons type situation where everyone benefits from fungibility but nobody wants to take the time and money to set up JoinMarket?
The answer is *no*. Here's why. If fungibility becomes degraded, it would first show up that large bitcoin institutions will reject your coins with the message *"Your money is no good here. Those coins were used for illegal or immoral uses 3 transactions ago"*. When this happens the owner of those coins is going to google the problem. He'll notice that *if he uses JoinMarket, he can thwart the analysis of the coins*. So I think the fungibility problem solves itself once you have easy access to privacy. Any attempt to enforce non-fungibility of bitcoin will push people to seek out privacy solutions.
This means in all the literature we have to write about **unlinking coins from previous owners** to our reasons for privacy. Also we should explicitly write a few words about how JoinMarket could help you if you've coins have been rejected. Companies intending to deploy anti-fungibility services might then think twice if they see people can un-taint their coins so easily.

Full blocks are good. Bitcoin's security model relies on miners being funded after the subsidy drops very low.

The only consensus that miners create is consensus about the history and ordering of transactions. All other rules about the 21m limit, no-double-spending, no-coin-confiscation and difficulty are enforced by the economy using full nodes.

**Elevator Pitch for Investors**
Firstly I'd like to clarify what I mean by investing. I don't want you to give your bitcoins to me. I dont want you to give your bitcoins to anybody. The private keys would be safely held on your own computer, known only by you and your wallet.
* Earn an income from your investment bitcoins.
* Very low risk. Your coins have to be on an online computer, but the software would only sign transactions that are valid and pay you the correct amount.
* No commitment, withdraw your bitcoins at any time.
* Improves the privacy of the bitcoin transactions, which makes bitcoin as a currency more useful and thus increases its value.
* Improves the fungibility of bitcoin, since the distinction between 'clean' and 'dirty' bitcoins will be meaningless.
* Your return is likely to be quite low. Low risk = low reward.
* You don't get paid unless people who desire privacy actually use this.

When BitcoinXT was being pushed, this subreddit was a real mess. Obvious lies like *"XT will solve all scaling issues"* and hype like *"XT will  take bitcoin to the moon!"* had thousands of upvotes in less than an hour.
Anybody calling for calm and pointing out that BitcoinXT had blacklists, would block tor, would raise block sizes to 8GB and would install Mike Hearn as a dictator, was mass-downvoted and hidden at the bottom of the thread.
Fact is at that point r/bitcoin was indeed dying by pacifism. Overrun by low effort echo-chamber content. This is the kind of thing you're calling for when you say *"no censorship"*, you really mean *"let those with the most reddit clones and bots control the conversation"*.
In hindsight, we were right. BitcoinXT is over. Mike Hearn has gone, he ragequit and sold out to bankers. Everyone who saw BitcoinXT as anything other than an attack on bitcoin had been mislead.

Your wallet needs to sync up to the date of the payment before it recognizes it and displays it to you. That's true whether you're on 0.10 or 0.12 version.

We'll see how much of that block space is actually economic if we see the transaction fees go up too.
Full blocks are good. Bitcoin's security model relies on miners being funded after the subsidy goes to zero.

You're right that it is not decentralized, that is being worked on.
As you mention, a sybil attack can happen even (or especially) in a decentralized system.
From the wikipedia article


In JoinMarket the sybil must own an amount of bitcoins several times everyone else that they want to mix with. This is expensive in opportunity cost. All the sybils must also compete in a market with everyone else. This is why mining in bitcoin is sybil resistant because it is expensive to mine.
If bitcoiners are happy with mining power being distributed by ASIC ownership and electricity costs, I hope they'll be happy with CoinJoining power being distributed by bitcoin ownership.

I agree it is very hard to measure. That is one reason to not do a hard fork.

@_date: 2016-01-26 18:54:23
I understand what you mean.
However a crucial point you've missed out is that holders cannot move their coins without the risk of making them work only on one fork. Sure people who don't use bitcoin in any way except to keep it in a paper wallet might not be affected (except for the price drop) but everybody else will certainly care. Specifically when you say *"everyone here in this debate today"* you skip everyone who actually uses bitcoin, rather than merely holds it.

This is misleading. Anyone can become a "Core developer" merely by writing a pull request and getting it accepted, same as any other software project. In my time of following the development I've seen complete outsides come in and write patches. It's untrue to say that Core is some closed group that nobody can join, rather, Core is a meritocracy.
Here's a good example. The operator of a bitcoin business had a problem with -rescan and wrote a PR, the other Core devs happily accept and thank him for writing. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:05:43


I know, my point is he missed the ideas about deployment which effects how dangerous a hard fork is compared to a soft fork. BTW, more lines of code doesn't not necessarily make something more complex.; "classic" could edit just one line but it still has to fix the DOS bug opened.


BitcoinXT contained code to raise the block size to 8MB, and then increase it by three orders of magnitude up to 8GB. This was in the source code and anyone can read it. Yes that very well may be too large even in 20 years, we already know 1mb is too large in some cases.




Miners have nothing to do with economic consensus. And even so, their power is economic power, not one-man-one-vote like democracy.




Gavin's blog post was debunked when it was first posted, but let's go again here for good measure. His argument relies on saying that as bitcoin grows, most people will not be able to run full nodes. If this came to pass it would be the death of a decentralized bitcoin. Miners could print as much bitcoins as they liked, confiscate other people's money and break all the other rules that the system relies on (e.g. difficulty)
His second point is that each individual node sees O(N). This is just a reformulation of the problem. The issue still remains that if A and B transact, the entire network must hear about it and process it.




It is. I hope that bitcoin's economic majority agrees with me, I'm pretty sure they already do. Their held coins have no value if bitcoin becomes a shitty copy of visa or paypal.


Sure, although Lightning too will be worthless if the underlying bitcoin is centralized. Bitcoin has enough capacity for now and I really don't see the rush to have a hard fork now *now*, **now**.
@_date: 2016-01-26 01:35:57
With respect, I don't think the hard fork has as much consensus as you believe.
The lists on the Bitcoin "Classic" website that people refer to were found to be misleading. Classic didn't even ask many of those companies if they wanted to be on that list. Plus many of them support 2MB in theory but do not support a contentious hard fork.

So miners, VC-backed companies and reddit? It wasn't too long ago that we all disliked coinbase for asking too many personal questions, now they've suddenly got bitcoin's best interests at heart.
I was following the scaling bitcoin conferences and the majority of people there were not in favour of a political hard fork like bitcoin "classic" is trying to force.
That as well as the significant price drops when XT and classic came out seem to indicate that the economic majority does not favour a political hard fork wresting control away from the core devs.


Please explain where my comments were trollish.
Yes there is opposition but obviously I disagree with it. If I wanted to just follow the majority I'd stick with USD.
For all the talk of censorship, I fail to see much of it. This sub is filled with talk about hard forks and there are other subs like \r\btc where people are free to air their views. On a free and open internet it's actually very hard to stop the exchange of ideas.

Your point that the core devs should "man up" you mean? The reason they're against hard forks isn't because they're big wimps.

Why do you want to do this? There's no reason to do it unless you want to hide the fact that you're running bitcoin from your ISP.
[This paper]( writes about how running bitcoin exclusively over tor makes it much easier to do an eclipse attack.
It *is* a good idea to run bitcoin over both clearnet and tor, because the tor stops your ISP from eclipse attacking you and the clearnet allows better sybil protection.
The only other reason to use tor with bitcoin is when broadcasting your own transactions to hide their origin IP address. With Bitcoin Core you can [disable wallet broadcasting]( and then use another script that broadcasts your own transactions through tor. (There's no step-by-step guide for this I know of unfortunately)

This site  contains more than 100 bitcoin companies and services that are ready, willing, able and even eager to support segwit. They include massive names like Localbitcoins, Coinbase.com and BitGo. So we know the economic consensus is fully behind segwit, there's no doubt about that.

A great blog post by Bram Cohen, inventor of BitTorrent, written back in June 2015.
I see lots of newbs joining us recently who might not know much of the history of the block size conflict.
Note that the blog post was written before the invention of segwit, which today allows the transaction capacity to be raised without any of the downsides of doing a hard fork to a larger block size.
Since the blog post was written, bitcoin's value has more than quadrupled and reached a new all-time-high.

@_date: 2016-03-07 17:07:11


No, because otherwise the miners could just print as many bitcoins as they liked.
In reality, if a miner creates a block with more bitcoins than in the inflation schedule, that block will be rejected by full nodes as though it never existed. When the miner goes to sell the bitcoins from his invalid block, he won't be able to find a buyer because all users will have rejected his block. (Unless he meets up face to face and sells his coins to a SPV-wallet user for cash, but that plan cant work long term)

Layer 2 solutions like LN don't have to have significant fees because the marginal cost is low.

I'm not blaming you but the bitcoin community should be aware that bitcoin's security model relies on most of the real economy being backed by full nodes. If everyone runs a lightweight wallet then bitcoin will die.
This means we should be very very careful before doing anything that makes it harder to run a full node and using it as a wallet; like raising the block size.

For purchases, each customer should get their own bitcoin address. If you use one address for everyone then you won't know which customer paid you, they could all claim to have paid because they can see each transaction.
For donations it's difficult. Public donation addresses are an unsolved problem so far. Ideally there'd be some kind of ECDH key (like stealth addresses or bip47)
One way to do it today could be to show a new bitcoin address on each page load. You could keep a public BIP32 key on the http server and obtain a new address from there, with the private key held offline. Then keep track of which addresses actually had coins sent to them.
Alternatively use a centralized service like mycelium gear.

I don't think there's anything to worry about with altcoins. Any altcoin uses the same technology as bitcoin and if they get to anywhere near the amount of users as bitcoin they will run into the same problems.
Remember it's not just transactors who are bitcoin users, holders use bitcoin as well and we also built the entire bitcoin infrastructure. I doubt anyone will build competing infrastructure for an altcoin if they think the underlying money isn't decentralized enough to hold. Holders are doing great, the price quadrupled since summer 2015 when this whole conflict got going.
The LN talks at scalingbitcoin calculated that bitcoin in its current form could support a significant portion of the world population.

RBF is a local node policy, it's not critical to the network consensus.

That's not altering *the supply*, that's creating an entirely new currency and trying to get people to switch to it.
The original bitcoin supply stays unchanged in that situation.
Yes, the rest of what you say is true. Incentives help stop the miners messing around but if not enough of the real economy uses full nodes then that incentives shifts to encourage miners to inflate the currency.

It's different to the ETC fork in that if the segwit-valid chain gets more work, there will be a big re-organization where the segwit-invalid coins are annihilated. To get more work, the segwit-valid chain only needs to have a higher price, because hashpower closely follows price.
So yes you can buy the coins, but one day they may cease to exist. Take that into account when deciding what a fair price to buy them is.

We are, there's been dozens of updates that improve. Listing some: libsecp256k1, headers-first sync, bip66, blockchain pruning, bandwidth targetting. I'm aware of initial-SPV mode being worked on as you mention.
The developers that made these updates are the same developers who warn that scaling on-chain cannot be a long term solution.


This is a different security model.
I believe I have given a direct answer. You asked what block size would cause an increase in costs of running my node, I answered that the cost goes up every day even at today's 1MB blocks. Raising them only makes the problem get worse faster.
BTW, old nodes sometimes have to re-do initial blockchain synchronization because something broke or got corrupted.
These are good questions you're asking. One thing that is pretty clear is on-chain scaling is a no-go. The way bitcoin will scale to a large proportion of the human population is off-chain low-trust software like LN.

Core already have a plan for scaling: 
If a hard fork happened it would spell the end of bitcoin as we know it. A controversial hard fork opens the door to enacting any change to bitcoin. Especially so if it can be demonstrated even without technical justification. A hard fork to 2MB in the face of vocal opposition will not break bitcoin. Not today. But it very clearly shows the method's efficacy.
This is why it's worth arguing against a political hard fork. Even if you don't care about anyone's vision, you benefit from bitcoin's properties of decentralization, censorship resistance and financial sovereignty. All that will be lost if bitcoin has shown it will change because of angry mobs on reddit.

If they hold onto bitcoins that just means they are living off their startup capital, which will eventually run out. ASICs don't develop and build themselves after all.


This is completely contrary to my view, and I believe to the view of the majority of bitcoin users.
Bitcoin has no value if it just replaces one central bank with another.


Why isn't this also true for fiat currency? When the fed de-linked gold from the dollar, foreign and domestic investors could have stopped holding it. But they didn't, partly because of politics, for example we know Saudi Arabia holds billions of dollar-denominated contracts because they get military aid from the US.

It's not philosophy, it's practical engineering of how bitcoin actually works.
Soft forks are not new currencies because all full nodes can still transact with each other. From the point of view of old full nodes, the miners may be doing odd stuff but it's all allowed under their known rules of bitcoin.
Soft forks are a tightening of the existing rules, hard forks are relaxing of the existing rules. That's why hard forks lead to diverging currencies and soft forks don't.
This is worth a read:

Both sides want to change the rules in some ways and keep the rules in other ways, so I don't think the political-philosophical positions of conservative/progressive have much to do with it. And anyway people from both sides generally have conservative/libertarian political views outside bitcoin.

This has always been true, at least since 2012 when the phrase "economic majority" was invented. Bitcoin gets it's value from people using it as money, so nodes which are part of the economy *are* more important.

If you don't already, get a genuine full node and use that as your wallet. (Or use Armory which depends on your full node, or use Multibit SPV and connect only to your own node)

That's not correct. Segwit is opt-in. Anybody can send to a segwit address because they are just normal bitcoin addresses, but to spend from them you need to update your wallet. So the updates can happen slowly and gradually as the individual need arises.

I've been in the bitcoin space for years now, commenting on reddit more and more as my knowledge grows. People on IRC can testify that they've been seeing me for years, I even have JoinMarket, an open source bitcoin project I work on. My github has activity going back more far earlier than the block size controversy.
I defended Core's roadmap because I saw the big blocker side as an attack on bitcoin. I'm very happy that this attack looks like it will fail. The reason it looks like we popped up suddenly is because the hostile hard fork was actually a serious threat.

You can't just say *"X needs users"* because people dont care about X. The way to get users is to explain why X is useful to them. So here goes.
**Elevator Pitch for Coinjoin Users / People who desire privacy.**
With JoinMarket nobody can steal your coins, you would mix them on your own computer. The software will never sign a transaction unless your coins are going to exactly the right address in the right amount.
Other mixing services mix your coins with other users, resulting in you getting back coins possibly related to drugs, stolen money or other illegal or immoral practices. This is highly undesirable if you just don't want your employer knowing which non-profits you support from your salary. Because of the incentives of JoinMarket, you have access to a huge amount of clean, untainted bitcoins to mix with at a very low price. Many of the bitcoins you're mixing with will be bought from regulated exchanges, owned by legitimate holders of bitcoin.
Not to mention you'd likely be paying lower fees for mixing than other services, because of the competition between willing-to-wait coinjoiners. Indeed if you don't mind waiting, you can wait around with a low offer fee and maybe another impatient coinjoiner will join with you.
It's easy to see why people are using JoinMarket, it is already being used for real life privacy. Here's an example of a coinjoin noticed recently on the blockchain, it is for 0.87btc or ~$200

There are also dis-economies of scale.
* Large amounts of equipment cost rent, while small hobbyest miners can live in the spare space around the home
* Large amounts of equipment require special cooling, while small mining rigs can be cooled by normal airflow.
* Large amounts of electricity require special wiring, smaller amounts can be transmitted through normal wires that most people already have.
Probably the real reason is the merger of mining ASIC manufacturers and miners.

A majority of miners could re-organise the blockchain at will. If they re-organise more than 24 hours worth (or less if they fake the timestamps, since this code only checks timestamps not block height) they could spend any coin they want even if they don't own the private key. And the stupid Bitcoin Classic node would happily go along with it.

That is one argument given yes. You could analyze it that increasing the block size reduces the incentive to run a node because it increases costs.

You could still do a fundraising effort and accept bitcoins, it's just storing the ownership records on the blockchain that's inefficient.
Equity ownership is not a trustless system anyway. The management of the company could turn around and say it's not honoring the shares, or the company could be nationalized and your shares would be left worthless. There's no need to involve the trustless blockchain on something that's inherently not trustless.
If you want to involve cryptography, just issue "share certificates" and sign them with PGP. And store who owns what in an SQL database somewhere in the company's headquarters.

Our understanding of bitcoin has vastly improved since the whitepaper, there's a lot that Satoshi didn't know about in 2009.
Miners do not decide on rules like the max block size or the 21m money supply limit. That is not my opinion, that is how the system works on a technical level.


Fallacy of the measurable again. Just because miners are one way of sybil-resistant voting doesn't mean they hold the power. The economic consensus holds the power and it is quite difficult to measure.

At equilibrium, bitcoin should be running with full blocks all the time. Mining ain't cheap and has to be funded somehow, without the scarcity of block space there's no reason to pay anything above a nominal transaction fee.
@_date: 2016-01-28 12:10:56


No it wouldn't. This would only happen if the economic majority wanted it.
Since wealth and income are power-law distributed, it means most people can be against the 21M limit yet it would still be in force if that's what the economic majority wanted.


Us two already discussed this here. This comment train is a good read, but essentially we find that you can only raise the 21M limit with a 'soft fork' if it already has economic consensus. So no, what you say is very misleading.

That transaction was included into block 455424, which took 54 minutes to appear after the previous block.
Paying a high fee can put you into the next block, but that block can still take a long time to appear because [block creation is a random process.](
The probability of a block taking longer than 54 minutes to appear is just **0.5%** (= exp(-54/10)), so this event happens on average once every 221 blocks (= reciprocal of the last number) or about **once every 37 hours**. (= 221 blocks / 6 blocks-per-hour)

The problem of amount-based-unmixing (also known as coinjoin sudoku) is solved both by JM and by CT. JM because the coinjoin amounts are equal, CT because the transaction amounts are encrypted.
JM also solves the problem of actually finding other peers to CoinJoin with. CT obviously can't do that on it's own. So a JM-like solution will probably end up very important for CT in practice.
@_date: 2016-03-29 14:56:13

Bitcoin has plenty of arbitrary numbers: the 21m money supply limit, the 10 minute block interval, the 2016 block difficulty retarget interval, the 210,000 block reward halvening interval, the 20000 sigop limit per block, etc etc

Yes maybe the phrasing could be different. It might just be a tactic of using insistent terminology, something like: *"it's not a vote, its a signal, because vote implies ultimate power and signal just implies readyness".*
On the other hand, there are some people who are explicitly against the view that the miners are beholden to the economy:

Reducing the block interval has the same effect as increasing the block size in terms of making worse incentives for miner centralization.
A lower block interval means a higher probability of stale/orphan blocks, which means miners will end up physically closer together to try to prevent this.

The blog poster forgets the power of incentives. Segwit transactions are cheaper than regular ones because they use less scarce block space. Individual people might be lazy but profit-motivated businesses like bitcoin exchanges and marketplaces will immediately update if it reduces their miner fee cost.
This is why Segwit is easier to roll out, people can update in their own time at their own pace. They know that if they do update, they will be rewarded by lower miner fees.
This is much better than trying to contact people who don't even read reddit, asking them to update to a hard fork node with not necessarily any direct benefit for themselves. *"You want me to waste all this time updating so that coinbase can make 2-transactions-per-withdrawal?"*




~~A hard fork has not been done before, that is simply wrong. (The May 2013 apparent fork is complicated, but it's not as simple as a mere hard fork) Fact is you could take Satoshi's client from 2009 and use it to verify the blockchain all the way until today. (Thought it would be somewhat inefficient)~~
There a very big "if" that the blog author has glossed over. *"If"* there's good communication and *"If"* there's a timeline that everyone can follow. We've seen in this controversy that those are by no means easy or likely. The KnC founder is forgetting the large number of people who have a lot of economic power who simply do not want a hard fork. We run our full nodes and use them as wallets, so you miners have no power to change anything like that. [We're not raising a single byte!](

The number you're measuring there is **not** the number of nodes. It's only roughly measuring upload capacity. As mentioned by others before, they're mostly AWS nodes spun up to try to influence the block size controversy.

Here is why I disagree that hard forks should be done for reasons like "lets practice".
Have you ever talked to nonbitcoiners much? One of their first questions is usually *"how can this 21m thing be real? cant the coders just change the number"*. When you explain the economic consensus that many times you realise how important it is, its bad to have a currency constantly changing because of the whims of "the community". Any hard fork would reduce trust in the currency as an investment, especially in the case like we've got now were the vast majority of technical experts disagree. No, a successful hard fork would be very bad for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:53:51
That's not a hard fork.

1) Yes, personal
2) The blockchain already increasing at a rate of 52gb per year. New nodes (and sometimes old nodes) must download and verify all that during initial blockchain synchronization. Increasing the block size increases the rate at which the problem gets worse.

This is news to me. Who accepted it? Certainly not me.
It may be worth mentioning (If I can interpret Adam Back's words) that he proposed 2-4-8 in August 2015 before much of this block size controversy had gotten going. He was eager to avoid a damaging split in the community (read his mailing list emails) and proposed a compromise to this effect to try to keep the peace.
However that was months and months ago. Times have changed since then. Bitcoin XT was released and failed. Bitcoin "Classic" has been proposed. Mike Hearn is gone, sold out to a private blockchain startup. The political motives of the block size controversy became clearer and clearer. Nobody will be *compromising* to 2-4-8, that much is clear.

Your idea would stop batch transfers thats all exchanges and other services currently use. With the coming fee market such inefficiency will be impractical and needlessly wasteful.

I'm pretty sure payment channels and other smart contracts often involve some fancy transactions that would all stop working if anybody tried this.
@_date: 2016-03-10 23:00:08
I respectfully disagree, full nodes do not care about what other nodes think.
The bitcoin security model is trust-nobody-but-yourself on whether rules are being followed (the only time others are trusted is in choosing the history and ordering of transactions, i.e. the miners) Your writing about *"Under sufficient decentralization, a chain that is at a sufficient depth is pretty much guaranteed to have been seen and validated by every participant."* is not how bitcoin works nor how it should work. To put another way, sufficient depth in a blockchain is still invalid if that blockchain breaks bitcoin's rules.

Sorry but this is really crappy reasoning. Bitcoin has survived until today but it could be made even better.

Both ethereums have fallen by more than 50% in bitcoin terms. So it's not clear at all that they've been going strong in terms of market value.
It's fair to measure them against bitcoins since the vast majority of the trading is against bitcoin not USD. All altcoins rally in USD term when bitcoin does because they're traded against it.
What's more, I've never seen any evidence that altcoins are actually used for commerce in a major way. Bitcoin has exchanges, marketplaces, casinos, a network of ATMs and users willing to pay 200sat/byte to make transactions. Altcoins have none of these. So splitting an altcoin in half (which reduces the value of its network by a factor of four, because of Metcalfe's law) has a much small effect than splitting bitcoin would.

Unfortunately this is one thing that was not well understood until about 2011-12. It's actually the economic majority that enforces the rules using full nodes, not miners.
Look at it this way, miners who mint the currency have a huge incentive to mint more above the 21m inflation schedule. The reason they don't do it is because those blocks would not be accepted by full nodes.
@_date: 2016-03-02 11:01:53
Yes but by default RBF transactions are only relayed by nodes if the increase in fee is more than the policy minimum fee. So it can't be used to easily DOS bandwidth but if you send it straight to the miner they might mine it.

I doubt it, the DNM business model depends on a decentralized censorship-resistant currency so I think it's unlikely they'll adopt any hard fork that moves away from that direction.
Fact is miners (and nobody else) has any way of measuring what the economy thinks right now, especially when so many actors are anonymous and don't read reddit every day.
And anyway the 40 minute confirmation time is only in effect until the difficulty retargets. After that we're back to 10 minutes. As long as the real economy backs the pre-fork chain the Bitcoin Classic fork will become less valuable and miners will abandon it.

See this:

Ultimately Bitcoin Core's governance ideas comes from the economic consensus that governs the Bitcoin network on a technical level.
The real power is with the economic actors who use full nodes not with developers. Bitcoin Core tries to somehow imitate that governance model as best it can.
You could compare this to the proposed Bitcoin Classic governance model which aims to be democracy. That could easily end in a situation where most *people* vote for something but the *economic consensus* disagrees (because wealth and income is power-law distributed) and therefore Classic would end up working in the wrong direction.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:45:59
You're forgetting the economic incentives.
All those segwit-invalid miners will start mining the segwit-valid chain because they want to make money. Remember the UASF proposal starts with the proposition that the economic majority supports it.


The same reasoning as above deals with this point. If the economic majority supports UASF then miners will appear somewhere to mine their chain and collect the block rewards. The blockchain won't just stay frozen if there's money to be made.

Some businesses supporting both forks does not simply the coins of both forks will have the same price.
If the segwit-invalid coin has a lower price, then it will stop existing. Hashpower follows price very closely, and if the segwit-valid chain gets more total work then it will destroy the segwit-invalid chain in a big re-organization.
The segwit-invalid coins will already be cheaper all else equal, because riskier assets always have a lower price.
This is why I think miners won't even attempt a segwit-invalid block. Remember that segwit transactions are non-standard and won't be relayed. Non-upgraded miners won't produce invalid blocks by accident, the fork has to start intentionally. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:45:08
Getting millions of SPV users to download a new wallet when they don't even understand satoshi-per-byte seems impossible. Especially if you've got a sizable part of the bitcoin community on every forum loudly saying "do not download this new wallet".

Finite is the same thing as scarce.

Yes people diversify but every unit of money put into an altcoin can't go into bitcoin. As that author writes that isn't true with status updates and messages on social networks.

Social networks do have a network effect but it's nowhere near as strong as that for currency. Even after all your talking I've never seen any evidence of any real commerce or acceptance of any altcoin, they're only used for speculation and their liquidity is limited to exchanges.

You are clearly from a western first-world country that has never had a currency crisis. Don't worry about finding trading partners, liquidity will appear if there's a need for it. Not everything has to be official like 
I remember it was taxi drivers that were the main traders. They get paid in cash and they love hard currency from tourists and outside visitors. They are also likely to own their own taxicabs and work for themselves, therefore would be likely to see through the official socialist lies. So to any Venezuelan I'd say go to organize with taxi drivers or anyone else who fits a similar profile (for bitcoin also try internet cafe owners)
Of course bitcoin can be sent through the internet too, so using localbitcoins.com and exchanging for domestic bank transfer would work too.

Look up the *fallacy of the measurable*.
Just because miners are the only ones who vote doesn't mean they have the power to do so.
The real power is with bitcoin investors and users who express their power by using full nodes to verify the correct chain, trading goods and services for bitcoin and holding bitcoin as an investment.
I'm sure the miners would vote themselves infinite coins if they could (no money printer in history has ever resisted temptation to print more money) But bitcoin is special because they don't have that power.

@_date: 2017-02-22 17:54:23


It increases the scale without increasing the scalability.
For example, verifying transaction signatures goes is quadratic in time, so doubling a transaction size means the verification time goes up by a factor of four. See this blog post for details about a transaction that took 25 seconds to verify: 
If block sizes were just increased, this bug could be used to break bitcoin. But segwit solves this bug by making signature verification linear instead of quadratic, which is a win for scalability in a way that a block size HF increase isn't.

Unfortunately not, its a flawed idea.
It introduces a systemic risk that already caused an accidental chain fork and a reorganisation of longer than 6 blocks. Nobody lost any coins but that was more luck than anything.

What you call a "fee event" (when transaction fees go up a bit) was the plan for bitcoin since the whitepaper.


Make no mistake, if the big block crowd manage to raise the block size to 2mb, they'll do so again if those blocks become full too. Like constantly raising the debt ceiling, the incentive for transaction fees will never kick in. And then the miners wont be adequately funded.

That depends on the details of what the wallet does, but most likely you go along with the miners. All the lite wallets I can think of (Electrum, Multibit, Android Bitcoin Wallet, etc) actually connect to several nodes or servers and download blocks headers from all of them and choose the most-work chain to follow. If the miners are attacking bitcoin they will obviously have the most-work chain and it's quite likely the lightweight wallets will find them, especially if miners spin up lots of sybil servers (come to think of it, that's probably one motivation of the Classic sybil attack)

Use a Core full node as your wallet. Keep an eye on the forums. Ultimately the real power is with the bitcoin economy backed by full nodes, not with the miners. If the miners don't do what the economy wants then there are ways to persuade them.

Looks like the [vast majority]( of those 10 sat/b transactions got confirmed during the north american nighttime.
This [fee estimation algorithm]( says 210 sat/b for confirmation within one block, 120 sat/b for confirmation within six blocks. And as above, 10 sat/b for confirmation within 24 hours (144 blocks)
As always, users can tradeoff their needs for fast or cheap confirmation times when using bitcoin's blockchain.
I think the fee rates are also massively influenced by price runups in bitcoin, and the recent price drop probably played a part in depressing fee rates. I've noticed price runups also seem to coincide with more JoinMarket coinjoins happening.

Well to be fair CPFP and RBF cost money and his business naturally wants to reduce costs, especially because customers could abuse it.
I think the biggest problem is using the blockchain as an exchange ticker. Imagine if bitstamp or bitfinex put all their trades on the blockchain, even satoshidice moved to off-chain.
On the other hand it's his free choice in building his business how he likes; if customers want a poisson-distributed service where blocks regularly take 45 minutes to appear, with fees not known in advance, with terrible privacy as everyone else can see your transactions, then they can use shapeshift. But in my technical opinion it's the wrong way of doing things.

That would break SPV wallets as well and those users would be required to download new wallets and adopt the new currency. Even BitcoinXT never proposed this because their model relies on tricking SPV wallets into following them.

Cash here has a technical meaning, distinguishing it from systems of credit. E.g. a Chaum bank or Zerocash-like system is distinctly cash like because you possess them outright, whereas Venmo/Paypal-like systems rely on trust and belief. Satoshi calling bitcoin "p2p electronic cash" is describing in academic terms as related to these sorts of cryptographic ledgers.

The PoW threat is only in the situation if &gt;50% of miners attack bitcoin. It requires support from the economic majority just like any other HF so I really doubt that support could be found unless a &gt;50% is happening. So miners shouldn't see it as a threat in response to just forking away to BU peacefully. I have nothing against them leaving if they don't want to mine bitcoin anymore.

Mining is very competitive and new agents can easily enter the marketplace if there's profit to be had (which there will be if the economic majority backs the coin). Fact is that miners work for the economy.


A much more practical alternative is waiting for the difficulty to readjust downwards on its own. Even if 75% of all hash power were to leave bitcoin, it would still only increase the waiting time by a factor of 4.
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:25:43

The bitcoin blockchain is mainly intended to be used as a store of transactions of the bitcoin currency.

What consensus mechanism for the protocol? There is none. You might be thinking of the consensus mechanism for the history of transactions (follow the valid chain with the most work) but that only functions if everyone agrees on the protocol, else we get a hard fork.


Maybe now you appreciate just how risky a hard fork is. Bitcoin was meant to be hard to change.

No because the newer nodes don't break any rules enforced by the older nodes.
For example the BIP66 soft fork. Pre-fork nodes would accept strict-DER-formatted signatures and non-DER-signatures. Post-fork nodes only accepted strict-DER-signatures. So from the point of view of pre-fork nodes they might notice that no more non-DER signatures are being made, it's a bit odd but it doesn't break any rules so the pre-fork nodes carry on.

Most of the Core devs honestly believe that a 2MB hardfork would be damaging for bitcoin (not necessarily because it's 2MB, but because it's a contentious hardfork that was successful.) They would probably view bitcoin as a failure and therefore not worth taking back.

I'm talking about holders of a currency, not day-to-day users. It's these holders that would have to be selling bitcoin for the miners to take notice.
In today's global capital markets, investors are not forced to hold any currency. For example, many US dollar-denominated assets are owned by Chinese investors who are by no means forced to hold them. So yes the situation is the same for central banks as in your vision of bitcoin's security model.

This is misleading.
BTC transactions are censorable too: a miner can refuse to mine your transaction and refuse to build upon a block with your tx inside. But because there's many miners, market competition will mean an individual miner will lose money by censoring.
LN transactions have the same economics. An individual node could try to censor a transaction but market forces mean it will lose money doing so.
Furthermore: LN does not have hubs. I think you're confusing it with a hub-and-spoke network.

Long term the blockchain will probably only be for high-value transactions. Second-layer protocols on top of the blockchain are what will be used by most people, with Lightning you can compress an unlimited number of transactions into one blockchain entry. It only has a slight reduction in the trust properties of using bitcoin's blockchain itself. Payment channels really are magic, we can have our cake and eat it too.

The most important part is that you **use** your full node when you're receiving bitcoins. That will protect you from accepting any segwit-invalid coins, and make bitcoin as a whole harder to attack.
Here are some guides that often help
Reducing bandwidth usage: 
Add `prune=550` to the `bitcoin.conf` file to reduce disk space usage, see: 
Add `dbcache=M` where M is the number of megabytes of RAM to allocate, going up to 4000 or so can make it sync faster. The default is 500.

In your view of bitcoin, how does mining power get funded? If blocksize always increases why would anybody pay transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-02-16 12:20:17
Using a full node as your wallet is the only way to use bitcoin in a low-trust way. You wouldn't accept gold coins or banknotes without checking they are genuine, a full node is how you check that bitcoins you receive are genuine.
To run one you [download]( and install Bitcoin Core. Once you run it it will create its [data directory]( inside there you should add a bitcoin.conf file [example](
Using the bitcoin.conf file you can configure bitcoin to run with more efficiency and use your system resources better. Run with -dbcache=M to set M number of megabytes of RAM to store the UTXO set in. Set this as large as you can without using up all your RAM, it makes Bitcoin Core's synchronization process quicker.

New coins are introduced into the ecosystem through mining. In the not-too-distant future, the number of new coins gradually drops until the maximum supply of 21 million coins is reached.

Hard forks require consensus from the economic majority to be safe, otherwise there will be a chain split.
There are a significant number of people in the economic majority who are digital gold fundamentalists. They watch the price go up and don't care about high miner fees (in fact they prefer them because it means bitcoin will be secure in the zero-inflation era). So they have absolutely no reason to do a hard fork to help increase capacity. People with this view have been in bitcoin since the very beginning and own much of the important infrastructure and many coins.
Therefore a hard fork will be unsafe. The increase-blockchain-capacity side needs to appeal to the digital gold side, but there's nothing they could give. The digital-gold side wants for nothing, the value of their coins went up 5x recently and hit a new ATH.

Core can't raise the block size. Core is just a loose group of developers that meet on github and IRC.
Raising the block size requires a hard fork, which requires consensus from the economic majority of bitcoin to be safe. A huge amount of people in the community are opposed to such a hard fork, which means if attempted it would result in two blockchains. Some core developers have been warning of this outcome and it seems people like to shoot the messanger and blame them.

So looks like there's two points in OP.
The first one is the issue about constantly monitoring for unilaterial channel closes. It looks like the OP doesn't know that it's possible to trustlessly outsource channel monitoring so users won't need to be online at regular intervals.
The second point is about users using exchanges or web wallets instead of lightning itself. The OP doesn't explain why this would be a particular problem for Lightning, since this problem exists using bitcoin on the blockchain already. We already see many people using blockchain.info's web wallet with all the trust and privacy problems that causes.
What will happen is people will use their own wallets instead of an exchange's web wallet for the same reason they use their own wallets today: trust, privacy and sovereignty.

This is only possible if merchants and exchanges are actually able to tell that mixing has occurred. CoinJoins look like larger bitcoin transactions, indeed many normal transactions look like CoinJoins just by accident. In addition there's other possible protocols like CoinSwap which completely unlink the transaction graph while just looking like normal transactions.
Additionally, protocols like micropayment channels and other smart contracts confuse the transaction history as a side-effect.

It doesn't make them no longer valid, it makes them censored. Nodes would still accept segwit transactions if the censorship stopped one day.

The Core Scaling Roadmap already contains hard forks to higher block sizes, but only after all the easy and safe scalability increases have been tried. After those we try the dangerous and difficult ones.

The core side supports a free market in transaction fees, those fees would pay for the miners as bitcoin money supply inflation goes down. This would result in a sustainable future for an inflation-free bitcoin.
The BU side is made up of people who make many on-chain transactions. They've seen transaction fees going up and want a bailout, not only a bailout but a dangerous hard fork bailout that could tear the currency in two and damage it's network effect.
I may be biased since I've been pro-Core since the start of this debate and spent a lot of my free time writing open source bitcoin software, but for me the Core has been following libertarian and pro-market principles since the start.

It's hard to measure because bitcoin is designed with privacy in mind. But it's still possible. That doesn't make it "wishy washy". Metrics which are precisely measurable are not always the most relevant ones, don't fall into the "fallacy of the measurable" as it's called.
This is always how bitcoin has functioned, the concept of the economic majority controlling bitcoin has been known about at least since 2012 when Meni Rosenfield came up with the name.
Your talk about a "committee" and "the fed" is way off. UASF doesn't work like that. Please actually understand the proposal before saying such things.


Well, it's not fine. Great features are being vetoed by special interest groups. Miner fees have gone up a lot and that is likely to incentivize many parts of the economy to try an alternative mechanism like a UASF.
If the economic majority overwhelmingly enforces it, then a UASF is safe.

Once people get so entrenched in a position no amount of facts will sway them. Especially when they see us pro-Core people having so much fun at their expense.
You have to know it feels **bad** to realize that you were tricked and lied to by Roger Ver, Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn and the others. It's far easier for people if their brain tells them that having bugs in BU is perfectly fine.
Only the loudest supporters are talking, make no mistake that some of the quiet ones over there are worrying and thinking.
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:16:49
It's also worth noting that non-upgraded miners don't produce segwit-invalid blocks either, because segwit transactions are non-standard so won't be relayed by the network.
A miner has to very intentionally mine a segwit-invalid block to start any fork.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:15:24
If you're using a full node to protect yourself from BU's hostile hard fork attempt, then port forwarding isn't so important. The most important is using your full node as a wallet when you receive transactions, it will protect you from accidentally accepting fake BU bitcoins and will make the whole bitcoin network harder to attack.

Even if he had 100% he couldn't hard fork. Hard forks require consensus from the economic majority otherwise you get two currencies.

Segwit has a block size increase which some people (especially the digital-gold types) don't care much for.
Merging a contentious hard fork into the codebase would tear the currency in two with all the lost money and problems that would cause. Core can merge any the code but they can't force anyone else to actually run that code.
Maybe there's some credit to the idea that no compromise can happen. It's impossible to hard fork just a little bit after all.

@_date: 2017-03-07 01:48:52
It enforces the new rules because the full node software (assuming the economic majority adopts it) will reject all blocks that it considers invalid. It suppresses segwit-invalid blocks, but not on the p2p layer but on the consensus layer. Segwit-invalid blocks are simply not bitcoin according to the UASF nodes.
You could think of it by analogy. A careful goldsmith will always reject fool's gold. Bitcoin full nodes are software goldsmiths. If you recode them they can change was they consider to be "real gold". If the change it backward compatible like segwit, then that's a soft fork and is much safer.

You don't know it's 25% of bitcoin users, all you know is 25% of miners. You've been corrected on this before so this confusion is starting to come off as deliberate and dishonest.
DNMs work via the mail system, 40 minute confirmation times are nothing compared to shipping time of days/weeks. This is true for any commerce on the internet which bitcoin is involved in.
The DNM business model depends on bitcoin a decentralized censorship-resistant currency. Bitcoin won't become centralized straight away after a successful hard fork, but it will happen one day which means investors will sell it to the ground now. [As they have done before every time a hard fork threatened]( which will force DNMs (and everyone else) to take notice. 
We also have plenty of evidence from bitcoin holders (in a way that cant be cheated) that they do not support any hard fork.

We can't ask him anymore but it seems Satoshi's early vision involved fraud proofs (which in the whitepaper is called SPV mode), which is where most people run lightweight wallets with the same security as full nodes, and a new security assumption is that they are not partitioned away from full nodes. Fraud proofs turn out to be really hard to implement although there was some talk about them at the ScalingBitcoin conference in Hong Kong.

Feathercoin shared part of it's blockchain history with litecoin. Yet feathercoin and litecoin are still alts of each other.

LN allows for trustless outsourcing of channel monitoring so people won't lose their coins if they go offline for a bit.
Hub and spoke networks are less efficient than mesh networks because those hubs need to lock up lots of their own bitcoins. 
Your solution of raising the block size would destroy decentralization by reducing the number of full nodes. LN and other solutions may not solve everything just yet but at least they won't destroy the very thing that makes bitcoin valuable.

Oh Boohoo. I personally don't think it's fair that miners are blocking segwit, but they are technically able to the same way that they are technically beholden to full nodes in bitcoin.


No it wasn't, people were thinking long term about bitcoin's resistance to change, what's to stop a miner printing more than 21m coins or stuff like that.


You were saying the core developers never even wanted to met the mining community for a conversation. This is completely wrong, Satoshi Roundtable is one example of such a meeting.


Yes it does matter.
Miners running nodes doesn't do anything for the common user. Indeed one of the things the common user is checking for is misbehaviour by miners.
Bitcoin is valuable because it's low-trust. If it ends up being a system where we trust the miners who print money, we might as well return to using the USD where we all trust the federal reserve that prints money.

That's an interesting view but it doesn't match up with the price movements. The price immediately dropped after XT was released and then started to rise as it became clearer that it had no support. The price even reached a high of $500 at a time when Mike Hearn and others were fairly silent.
If what you say was true, the price would have been slowly falling as more and more people became aware and convinced of the arguments for a contentious hard fork like XT.

I see what you're saying. You say that miners should somehow measure what the economic majority thinks and then hard fork based on that.
Well this cant be a method to decide whether a hard fork should happen, because if miners have some magical way to measure economic consensus, then everyone else presumably has access to it too. So we don't need to leave it up to the miners.
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:37:53


A hard fork being difficult to do is the only thing that protects bitcoin's important rules. Rules like no spending a coin without knowing the private key, no double spending, only inflation according to the schedule that tops out at 21m.
If a hard fork is successful against all technical advice then bitcoin has failed to be immutable.
@_date: 2016-03-06 20:28:05
The only disingenuous one is yourself. You are projecting.
For fees, it says so very simply in the whitepaper. As the subsidy reduces, fees go up to fund the miners and the currency can be completely inflation-free.

It's not dangerous to any full node user as long as the economic majority supports this UASF.
Right now some miners are blocking excellent technical updates for stupid political reasons, the bitcoin economy won't stand for this. Miners should do their job if they expect to get paid.
Very quickly the miners will switch over to the segwit-valid chain unless they want their expensive ASICs to be hemorrhaging money.

I'm not in the know but I predict the big blocker side will continue to gradually lose support.
The Core developers will get further and further along their roadmap; releasing segwit, fraud proofs, IBLT, etc until it becomes even more clear that bitcoin won't crash and die like Hearn/Gavin predicted, then big block hard-forkers will entirely lose support and we'll stop talking about them.
However I know in any schism the two sides can exist indefinitely. It's possible we'll see r\btc still going years from now, still complaining about theymos, moderation, arrogant core devs, replace-by-fee and all their other (in my view, unsympathetic) grievances.

I still work on JoinMarket. For those that don't know, it's an implementation of coinjoin aiming to improve the anonymity and fungibility of bitcoin.
This idea on the bitcoin mailing list is really interesting ( Committed bloom filters to help build lightweight bitcoin wallets that don't completely ruin their privacy like bip37 wallets do today 
I wrote some analysis about it ( and I think that it's is a good idea that would be excellent for privacy.
This idea from the mailing list is quite nice ( a data structure with the aim that the UTXO set could be archived and then full nodes wouldn't need to store the entire thing. Instead, when users spend a very old coin there would also have to be a cryptographic proof that it is indeed unspent.

Your post talks about miners but I'm also concerned about full nodes. Raising the block size moves the cost from transactors to full nodes.
Bitcoin's security model requires that the economic majority uses full nodes as their wallet, otherwise the miners are able create more than 21 million coins or confiscate other people's money. Miner's being decentralized doesn't help with this problem because they all have the same incentive (money printers always have an incentive to print more)

It's worth mentoining that for bitcoin to stay decentralized and trustless, this will have to be true.
Full nodes the alpha and omega of bitcoin. Everyone else just piggybacks. If the majority of the bitcoin economy doesnt use full nodes, miners could do all kinds of bad stuff like printing infinite money, stealing other people's coins, spend coins twice or more, etc etc

These fake nodes have been observed for quite a while now, around 5% of the total listening 'nodes' in the network are owned by this company. They do nothing but aggressively announce themselves to attract more people to connect to them and de-anonymise themselves. For all we know they own even more nodes than this, it's impossible to know how deeply they have sybil attacked the network. The main reason we know about this group is that they are particularly aggressive and caused massive denial of service problems when Breadwallet and other SPV clients connected to them. 
It is designed exactly to be evil. Beyond being dragnet surveillance of the entire network, it's adversely affecting SPV clients like Breadwallet who were unable to sync when they hit these fake nodes. Anybody with knowledge to set up sybil nodes like this also knows exactly how it will adversely affect the network. Note that Bitcoin keeps working despite of this attack, but it's unbelievably shitty behavior to attack the network and sell it as a service.

To any complete newbs reading: Bitcoin is a decentralized system that isn't controlled by any single entity.
The money supply of bitcoin is controlled by an algorithm, right now it creates 12.5 new bitcoins every 10 minutes on average. Every 4 years this number halves to 6.25btc, then 3.125btc and so on until an upper limit is reached. That limit is 21 million bitcoins and there will never be any more than this. See:

SPV wallets blindly follow whatever 51% of the miners do. So if they create more than 21 million bitcoins your SPV wallet will blindly go along with it.


This can be easily defeated by sybils, and also doesn't solve the miner trust issue. Also with the way SPV wallets work now, all those nodes learn what your addresses are and so can spy on you.


The only security method I know which works is to connect your SPV wallet only to your own full node. Don't know how many people do this.

The fact that exchanges support both forks does not imply both fork's coins will have the same price.
If the segwit-invalid coin has a lower price then it's game over for it. Hashpower follows price and once the segwit-valid chain gets more total work then it will re-org the segwit-invalid chain out of existence.
The fact that the segwit-invalid chain can be annihilated like this will reduce its price because risker assets always have a lower price all else equal.
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:31:08


It was originally believed that segwit isn't needed for LN with indefinite channels but attacks were found that make that no longer true. See 
All those teams sat down and created a common protocol, so their software can transact with each other. That protocol requires segwit.


I don't see how it's any different from running a bitcoin node.
Also no altcoins is used anywhere near as much as bitcoin so scalability technology like LN is not as interesting to them. Not to mention that most altcoins are made by scammers not developers.

@_date: 2017-03-09 15:07:59


Looks like the source of your misunderstanding is you believe there needs to be one payment channel between any two entities that want to transact.
That isn't true. Each person needs one payment channel and then they can transact with anyone else who is on LN. The reason is that LN is routed payment channels which can hop between nodes.

Publicly say that you'll support UASF-activation of segwit. LN exists today in alpha on the testnet and it only needs segwit to be usable on mainnet. You won't get it immediately today but there's no other solution.
Many of us here would love to make segwit activate but because of the political situation it's being blocked. Some miners are happy to sit back and collect your miner fees. UASF seems to be the only method left to make segwit happen now.
Miner fees could easily go up by another x50 or x100. Maybe it's $5 per typical blockchain transaction or so. I think businesses that rely on small payments should be the strongest supporters of UASF-segwit because otherwise they won't be able to compete for block space with use-cases like store of value/speculation, dark net markets, capital flight, business-to-business payments, international payments, etc
I think a lot of businesses avoid politics so as not to get flak, but soon enough some of them will have to realize that their very survival depends on it.

Every business has to openly advertise itself to get customers. Almost all the big players with full nodes are known.

What matters more is % inflation. 12.5 BTC is not much compared to the 15 million that already exist. When I got involved in bitcoin the annual inflation was above 10% and now its less than half that.
Fee auctions will happen, there's no way around that. The block size limit must stay finite, you cant keep bumping it up just to avoid fee auctions.
A valuable bitcoin will be a strong, decentralized and censorship-resistant one, not a bad copy of the centralized paypal network.

I'm really intrigued and concerned that you say this. I've not heard any technical arguments against segwit, only political (segwit will stop a block size hard fork) and related to personality (segwit is coded by Core which is apparently evil).
Segwit would be great for many other stuff including JoinMarket and fungibility in general.. I really don't see any downside.
BTW, it turns out a useful LN does require segwit. See these links:
BTW2, just sitting on your coins effectively means your coins are frozen because as soon as you make a transaction you end up picking a side.
It's not surprising that LN was being worked on before the Hong Kong conference because that paper came out in early 2015 IIRC.

They've already done the exact same thing but with bitcoin's blockchain. They have a wallet app which fully trusts coinbase, and you can use coinbase's other services like buying/selling bitcoin straight from the app.
As long as you have the option to use your own wallet then its okay (and many many people today exercise this option and keep their coins on their own computers)
Similarly, Coinbase is already a big hub in bitcoin today, because it has a big exchange. Think about it, even today if Coinbase.com went down then bitcoin's price would get hit hard same how it got hit when MtGox went down. Question is whether LN makes this situation inherently worse, I think the answer is no, because hubs have a big cost associated with him which is the amount of bitcoins they must lock up doing nothing else. That means there is a pressure against centralizing which is only overcome by a large business like Coinbase. It's actually more efficient to run a mesh network than a hub-and-spokes network for this reason.

This might be your misunderstanding. That is not how UASF works.
For example the segwit-opposing miners could create thousands of sybil nodes which upload segwit-invalid blocks to everyone. That would get around any eclipse attack, but the USAF would be unaffected.

@_date: 2017-03-06 19:31:15


That's not correct. Non-upgraded miners won't produce segwit-invalid blocks by accident, because of the standardness rules. Segwit transactions are non-standard so don't get relayed by the p2p network, they'll never reach any non-upgraded miners.
But as you mention, they might *build on top of* somebody else's segwit-invalid block. This could be avoided by the miner using a border node.
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:13:31


Yes, and those blocks will be rejected by the full nodes belonging to the economic majority.

Hello chilldillwillnill2, welcome to reddit. I'm not sure if we've actually spoken before, maybe you're thinking of one of your sockpuppets ?
[Economic consensus is in the bitcoin wiki]( If you read carefully you'll find the actual number of nodes doesn't matter, instead nodes are the way these economic entities express their view. A node running on a raspberry pi somewhere does nothing to influence consensus because you cant trade with it, by contrast the node that controls localbitcoin's wallet has a large amount of influence.
If you're thinking of the lists on the Bitcoin "Classic" website, they were found to be misleading. Classic didn't even ask many of those companies if they wanted to be on that list. Plus many of them support 2MB in theory but do not support a contentious hard fork.

Well if they obviously misbehave, the economic majority could always hard fork to a new PoW algorithm and turn all the miner's expensive equipment into space heaters.

Hard forks are strictly more problematic than soft forks, user activated or otherwise, because soft forks are backward compatible so not every single node needs to upgrade. Only enough of the economy wants 


Segwit has so many good features that are attractive to so many different people, and all they take to be active is signalling by the miners.
Fee rates have tripled in the last 3 months. They were ~70 sat/b in December and today regularly reach 210 sat/b. The economic majority has to pay these fees and watch as miners rake in increased profits. No wonder many bitcoin businesses are pissed off.
Note that after the UASF email on the mailing list, jlopp from BitGo almost immediately sent his own email expressing curiosity and eagerness.

Yes, and Bitcoin Unlimited implemented a different protocol, then attempted to get people to run it.
That made it an altcoin which happened to have high aspirations of taking over Bitcoin.
And anyway the Bitcoin protocol is also implemented by others apart from Bitcoin Core; you've got Bitcoin Knots, btcd, libbitcoin, ruby-btc, Bitcoin full-RBF, Bitcoin Addrindex and a couple of others. So the OP is not saying that Bitcoin Core == Bitcoin.

[CoinDesk: Why Many Smart Contract Use Cases Are Simply Impossible](
Ethereum's blockchain is already larger than 10GB despite existing for less than two years. It is also highly unprunable so every full node has to store almost the entire thing on it's hard drive. In contrast to bitcoin nodes which can enable pruning and not have to store much more than 2-3gb forever.

No that's misleading, you're acting as if that's a given.
The whole point of a UASF is that miners will be compelled to support the soft fork because otherwise their mined bitcoins won't be accepted by the economy.
If the economic majority was 100% for segwit there would be nothing the miners could do.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:43:59
No that's not right. An eclipse attack is nothing like UASF.
An eclipse attack is where a node is partitioned away from the rest of the p2p network, the attacker can then spy on the node or feed it alternative blocks if it has some mining power.
An eclipse attack works on the p2p network layer, UASF works on the consensus layer. I'm so confused how someone would confuse the two.

OK I get it, so this is an insurance policy.
The point is to be visible and known to everyone. Right now I'm thinking a big multisig address with privkeys held by well-known personalities from the pro-bitcoin side who have some trust. This is some centralization but shouldn't be too dangerous, probably would be you or any other owner of top bitcoin businesses who are willing to defend bitcoin. (BitGo's CEO for example going by his recent tweets)
Also, the coins could be paid to the defending miners on the new PoW chain if it ever gets to that point.
BTW, you could pay back the coins back to a change address (make sure people use change addresses) in the event that the threat recedes.

Larger blocks (up to 8GB that XT proposes) mean that it becomes harder to run full nodes, which are the only trustless way to use bitcoin. And there needs to be a lot of them that people use as their wallets spread over wide geographical and economic areas, otherwise the system devolves into just trusting the miners.
Larger blocks also increase the incentive for miners to be physically close to each other. We already see miners were using SPV mining because of this, which lead to the 4th July accidental fork.

Bitcoin is meant to follow the rules no matter what.

This is what I mean by digital gold becoming digital aluminium.

I'll try to give you at least one reason now:
Hard forks require consensus from the economic majority to be safe, otherwise there will be a chain split.
There are a significant number of people in the economic majority who are digital gold fundamentalists. They watch the price go up and don't care about high miner fees (in fact they prefer them because it means bitcoin will be secure in the zero-inflation era). So they have absolutely no reason to do a hard fork to help increase capacity. People with this view have been in bitcoin since the very beginning and own much of the important infrastructure and many coins.
Therefore a hard fork will be unsafe. The increase-blockchain-capacity side needs to appeal to the digital gold side, but there's nothing they could give. The digital-gold side wants for nothing, the value of their coins went up 5x recently and hit a new ATH.

The feerate on that transaction is 105.116 satoshi/byte.
According to  that will approximately take between 5 and 75 blocks to confirm.
There is a cost/time tradeoff. If you want it to confirm faster you could try fee-bumping if your wallet supports it, which is where your wallet re-broadcasts that transaction but with a higher fee.

Today SPV is used to mean something like what BitcoinJ does, which completely trusts the miners and would blindly follow them if they printed more than 21m bitcoins or confiscated other people's coins. Also the privacy properties of BIP37 are terrible.
Interestingly in the original whitepaper that phrase was used to means lightweight wallets with fraud proofs, which don't have to trust the miners.

Unless you run a full node and use it as your wallet, you have no control over the political and economic aspects.
If bitcoin's value comes from the network effect, splitting the currency in half is likely to reduce it's value by a factor of four. We've already seen price drops when the contentious software of XT and bitcoin "classic" was released.
In my opinion, if Bitcoin Core doesn't win this, there will be no bitcoin in a form you recognize it in a few years time.

Excellent comment. Everyone should read this despite the length.
tl;dr Just because everybody involved in bitcoin *today* believes in the 21M limit, does not mean that will be true in the future. Bitcoin must be able to keep a 21M limit even if most people (but not most of the economic majority) disagree with it.

Your incentive is that you know for sure that no more than 21million bitcoins have been created. If you use bitcoin as an inflation hedge then this is important knowledge.
On the other hand, it's only important when sending or receiving payments, so you could keep the coins in cold storage for years and then only start a full node when you want to buy more or sell some of your stash.

The same number (or more) of people will still use the blockchain. Lightning users still need to own at least one UTXO and that can only happen with a blockchain transaction.
Probably what it will end up looking like is when buying your first bitcoins the seller sends them directly to your LN payment channel address and once they are confirmed you can make an unlimited number of transactions. If you want to move them to cold storage or something like that, then you make a single blockchain transaction.

So let me put it this way. If coinbase.com proposed a hard fork where all transactions have to be associated with a real-life identity, would you support them because "they are currently a big part of Bitcoin and Bitcoin adoption" or would you reject them saying that went against bitcoin's value proposition.


Fine so Gavin and Mike didn't go. Peter R did go and was listened to, but his talk and paper about the fee market were ultimately shown to be wrong.
The conferences were open to everyone. I didn't see any indication that people wouldn't be listened to.








I understand this may be frustrating, but I think I have a more nuanced interpretation of free speech, and you guys at \r\btc also stop ideas spreading.
\r\btc also deletes comments now (although some of which is agreeable: e.g. the ones doxing and overtly threatening people).
Downvoting is most subreddits can also be a form of censorship. It hides the comments from most users and rate-limits your account from poster further. Downvoting by votebots is mere sybil attacking, downvoting by angry-mob-mentality is tyranny of the majority.
I've said before, it's interesting how on IRC where sybil attacks and angry-mob-mentality is curtailed, almost everyone supports the core developer's plan.


I understand that this must be frustrating. However look at it from our point of view. Mike Hearn and others seem to have the view that bitcoin is a mere payment network and [don't seem to care about centralization]( The rest of us see bitcoin as a currency, decentralized, censorship resistant. This isn't about the block size, it's about what bitcoin should be. There can be no compromise in this view. Mike Hearn originally proposed blocks up to 8GB, why would that crowd be happy to stop at 2MB (which already can be reached with a segwit soft fork) He even tried to install himself as "benevolent" dictator of bitcoin development. No way anybody was going to compromise with that.

@_date: 2017-03-07 12:22:25
"User activated" is good because it emphasizes how this thing only happens if the bitcoin economic majority wants it. Calling it "flag day activated" or "block height activated" gives the impression developers can unilaterally push it onto the network, which isn't true and would be very dangerous if attempted. That's probably why this phrase was preferred.
And yes I agree Satoshi came up with the idea first. I was thinking of posting a thread about it one of these days how UASF fits in with "Satoshi's vision" if the word of the creator somehow helps.

If bitcoin becomes centralized it will have the same basic features as visa and paypal. Centralized miners will be able to reverse or freeze any funds they want. Centralized nodes will be able to spy on you. Centralized nodes will be compelled to collect user's identities by law.

Let me just understand this correctly.
So we'll use political methods to create a hard fork to a block size limit of 2MB. Your post implies that if 2MB fill up while the block reward is still low then you'd do a hard fork again to raise the block size.
Then, when the block subsidy is "low enough" you again use politics to not raise the block size.
If this is what you're saying, it has too much politics involved. I can predict that when the subsidy gets low enough then the political pressure to raise it again will be huge. It would be the same thing as a tragedy of the commons, every individual bitcoin user is hurt by higher transaction fees, but unless they pay it they won't have a secure network. So most of them will use political methods to try to raise the block size again and again.
The system changes the way bitcoin works by introducing a huge amount of politics. It's not something that can be accepted frankly.

That's not the definition of a hard fork. What you're talking about is closer to the accidental fork soon after the bip66 upgrade.

The way bitcoin works right now requires a tradeoff between scale and trustlessness. Some people in the community want to trade away trustlessness in order to get more scale (lower transaction fees and so on), others in the community say trustlessness is the only thing that makes bitcoin different and special, so shouldn't be compromised.
Also there's new technology that cuts through the scale/trustlessness tradeoff, but currently some miners who are pro-blockchain-scaling are blocking it.

LN payment channels can't do everything. They can't do cold storage for example. Also the trust properties are slightly less strong with payment channels (there's the temporary holdup risk if the other side disappears) so very large payments might still want to take delivery of coins on the blockchain.
Also, to open a payment channel each user still needs to own at least one UTXO on the blockchain. Long term I imagine the UX will be that a bitcoin newb buys their first bitcoins and the trader sends it straight to their opening payment channel.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:05:16

One reason could be that using "the mempool" as a metric is easily manipulated by adding lots of cheap transactions and never confirm. I think people have only been posting it because it gives a satisfyingly large number.

Why don't you just use something like Paypal? It literally does the same thing Gavin and Mike are asking for. Lots of transactions but with a trusted third party. I don't understand all these bitcoin users who don't care about being low-trust, what's the point otherwise?
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:28:00


That's not true, plenty of people opposed p2sh and preferred luke-jr's alternative proposal. Also some people opposed CLTV and CSV because those are required for LN and these people are against LN.
But it doesn't matter. For soft forks, either one of the mining majority or the economic majority matters.

@_date: 2016-01-24 16:16:15


















The average block size is only about 750kb, we're not near the 1MB limit despite what reddit hysterics say. 
It's likely that segwit will be released in the next few months and the increased fees will encourage people to gradually adopt it.


This is why such a hard fork *must not* happen. Why we argue against even 2mb. BTW segwit will give you basically the same increase as 2mb.

Lightning can compress millions of transactions into one blockchain transaction, then it makes sense to pay $5 to the miner for each on-chain transaction. It would make much less sense to pay that much if each blockchain transaction represented a single bitcoin transaction.

That's impossible. Bitcoin is a flooding network where every transaction has to be relayed to every single node. An inherently inefficient design needed for trustlessness. The idea that every coffee purchase and online tip can be on the blockchain is ridiculous.
Luckily there are alternatives. Routing transactions instead of flooding them to everyone. It's much more efficient, cheaper and provides instant confirmations rather than waiting for the next block. This is what the Lightning project intends to do.


Satoshi only intended this in the early stages to help bootstrap the new currency. That was over half a decade ago now.

Orphans is not the reason a hard fork is risky.
The biggest cost right now to full nodes is initial blockchain synchronization. At 1MB blocks the blockchain grows by 52GB per year, forever, all of that must be downloaded and verified before a node starts up.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:11:02
Well the ideas of OP's and that blog are quite similar, the blog's suggestion is just more automated.
For hardware wallets and cold storage Cohen's idea doesn't change the UX much because all those transactions can be created at the same time. While in OP's suggestion I assume the user has to plug in their hardware wallet again and again for every fee bump.
Also, in OP's suggestion the user has to constantly come back to online watch their wallet and see if they need to fee bump. In Cohen's suggestion the user makes all their decisions at the start and doesn't have to think again until their transaction gets confirmed or goes into the "failed" state. So from a UX point of view it might be better.

Bitcoin isn't for the average user (whatever that means) then, it has a certain value proposition and it should work on those case. There's no point ruining its fundamental attributes to appeal to average users who already have better technology anyway.

Fact is that it's permissionless because it's decentralized.
You can say decentralization is not as important as something else, but that's another argument.

How has the UX of bitcoin gotten worse?
Transactions on the blockchain were never instant but took an *average* of 10 minutes. Blocks that take longer than 30 minutes to appear happen several times a day, and if you want a confirmation there's nothing you can do but wait. Bitcoin has always worked like this.
Really good UX will be achieved by second layer solution that allows instant bitcoin transactions.

What reasons? All I've heard is attack's on the personalities of the core developers.
To achieve the kind of scale on the blockchain that people are looking for would destroy bitcoin's decentralization and therefore it's value. That's a fact. Watch the videos from the Hong Kong and Montreal conferences. The real way to scale is new technology, not just bumping a constant in the source code.
Everyone wants cheaper bitcoin transaction fees, Core's roadmap has a way to get there but miners are blocking it. I've not seen any proper technical arguments against segwit either, the closest is *"if segwit activates then we'll never get a block size hard fork"* which is purely political.
It must feel good to be in the Church of Gavin but in practice very few others hold that position. The developers of BU haven't even ported segwit to their software.
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:57:15

With respect, it's probably because you're not aware of all the writing that's been done on this topic since you only likely hang around reddit rather than somewhere technical.
If bitcoin becomes centralized it will have the same basic features as visa and paypal. Centralized miners will be able to reverse or freeze any funds they want. Centralized nodes will be able to spy on you. Centralized nodes will be compelled to collect user's identities by law.
Centralized systems are always more efficient. Bitcoin's model of flooding every transaction to every node will always be less efficient than something like visa or paypal.
Firing the core devs by adopting this alternative client can only be bad for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:03:46
I guess because it's easy to spin up a couple of hundred network nodes, the attacking miners could just do that and end up with almost all the SPV wallets connected to them.
The miner's invalid chain will have more work than the Core node's valid chain, so the SPV wallets will reject the Core chain. So even one connection to an evil node is enough to make the SPV wallet follow the wrong chain.

Merge mining is something else. If they merge mine then they cannot trick the SPV wallets into following them.

Classic is not the first altcoin that did a "simple" change then tried to pass it off as true innovation. Litecoin tried the same thing by merely reducing the average block interval to 2.5 minutes and changing the PoW algo.

@_date: 2017-03-07 11:06:14

It's not like they're being nasty parents who don't want to give their children candy.
Many developers have written about why raising to 2MB (or 8MB, 20MB, 8GB or whatever the proposal was) is a bad idea. The ideas were not able to get consensus and so the developers did not implement them, they cannot do something they honestly do not believe will work. They came up with segwit, LN, ILBT and so on to help increase bitcoin's capacity.
@_date: 2016-01-09 18:12:33


Sort of. I'm worried they can damage bitcoin without even being the economic majority.
One of the most damaging outcomes is a long-running unresolved hardfork. Where companies like coinbase sell XT-coins but many other places use the normal bitcoin. The two coins use the same tcp ports and address formats. Users would try to send their coins to one fork and it wouldn't work, the service not recognizing them. If bitcoin's value comes from the network effect, splitting the network in half would reduce the value by one-quarter.
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:15:07
You could use bitcoin with a bitcoin debit card. With those you deposit bitcoins onto the card and it interfaces with the Visa or Mastercard network when you want to buy things just like a normal debit card.
There's a couple of companies that offer such bitcoin debit cards, it depends on where you live.

If a bitcoin mining coalition reaches greater than 50% of hash power, then have the power to destroy bitcoin. That's why bitcoin needs decentralized miners to work.
Right now miners are not very decentralized and some of them are saying talking and threatening that they will join together to get above 50% and destroy bitcoin. Their aim is to push people onto another cryptocurrency which has different rules (these new rules greatly benefit large miners so that's their reason for doing it)

They're not just forks of the code, they are also forks of the blockchain. After some time, there would evolve bitcoin-core-coins and xt-coins, unlimited-coins, classic-coins which would not be convertible. They would be entirely separate currencies that happened to share a history before the hard fork.

If you have a 10 minute timeout, then you'll have issues with blocks taking longer than that just by chance.
The probability of a block taking longer than 10 minutes to appear is 36%, that's every third block.
It sounds to me like LN would be perfect for shapeshift, because fees are predictable in advance and transactions are instantly irreversible, unlike the blockchain where both fees and confirmation times are very noisy.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:04:40
Something like this could be done in a decentralized way. 
People would create bitcoin transactions that pay very high miner fees. They coinjoin their input with a coinbase output to make sure it can only be spent on the original blockchain. Then publish this transaction widely where miners can find them. The miner adds their own signature to the coinbase input and collects the money by mining it. Miners still have to wait 100 blocks before they can move the money (although this is true with their regular reward anyway)
Note that you can create many transactions that coinjoin your input with lots of different coinbases, so all the miners who mine on the original blockchain get a chance to collect money.
All that's needed is code that does this and a kind of message board where these unsigned transactions can be published.
On the other hand, if the anti-bitcoin miners get 50% and don't care about wasting money for a long time, our monetary incentives can't do anything. We've always known that &gt;50% of miners can destroy bitcoins if they want to.

We don't know what the economic majority wants, it's very difficult or impossible to measure.
What we **do** know is that there is a significant bitcoin price drop whenever a hardfork client like XT and classic comes out. It's evidence that the economic majority does not favour a political hard fork wresting control away from the core devs.
We also know that the vast majority of the participants of the scaling bitcoin conferences were not in favour of a political hard fork like bitcoin "classic" is trying to force. If there's a huge crowd of people wanting a hard fork, why did none of them come to Canada or Hong Kong?
Finally, we know that on forums like reddit its easy to make support seem stronger or weaker than it really is. In other places like the IRC channels and mailing lists, support for the core devs is almost universal. (Maybe because IRC is harder to brigade, sybil and attack with votebots? Who knows, maybe it just attracts a different crowd)

That will cost them an unbelievable amount of money. Miners have massive investments in ASICs and won't allow them to be destroyed like that.


Miners vetoing segwit when it has so much support from bitcoin businesses, is a declaration of war to the economic majority.
Just look at this page:  it has more than 100 bitcoin businesses that are ready, willing and able to use segwit. They include massive names like localbitcoins, coinbase.com and BitGo which provides wallet services to many exchanges like kraken and bitstamp.

The 1.7MB or 2MB figure for segwit depends on exactly the kind of transactions in use. The profile of bitcoin transactions has changed a bit in the last year, so the 1.7mb figure was an underestimate.
To get an informed opinion I recommend you read the primary sources: the conference talks, the developer mailing list, the developer meeting transcripts and so on, not just relying on reddit.

You need to protect against duplicate withdrawals from the account balance. In the UTXO model you can only spend a coin once and that's that.
Ethereum apparently uses accounts:balance, it might be worth studying their scheme a little to see what they did to deal with the double-withdrawal problem.

(Maybe because IRC is harder to brigade, sybil and attack with votebots? Who knows, maybe it just attracts a different crowd)
Most of the companies which are listed as supporting bitcoin "classic" are only there because they expressed support for 2MB. Even Luke-jr was nearly put on their list because there's a post where somebody asked him to choose between 2mb and 4mb and he chose 2mb.
The significant bitcoin price drops when XT and classic came out is also more evidence that the economic majority does not favour a political hard fork wresting control away from the core devs.
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:04:00
Thanks for posting. I'm not a core dev but I observe the development process so have some knowledge.


They believe a large number of transactions on the blockchain would damage decentralization. The end result of rationing the space on the blockchain would probably mean people would only be willing to pay for high-value transactions to be included. Unless there's not enough demand to fill the blocks like today, in which case low-fee transactions would be mined just fine.


Proof-of-work is expensive. At equilibrium and assuming no fees, 25btc*exchange_rate dollars of energy must be burned every 10 minutes on average. At today's prices is nearly $10,000 per 10 minutes, or $1.4m per day. Obviously this number will drop as the reward halves in a few months time, and again every 4 years, but if it drops too low then bitcoin will be vulnerable to attack.
And all that mining is pointless in the same way the military is pointless. The only point it has is to protect against other miners. If everybody could just agree to trust each other we could do without mining or money. But that will never happen, in the same way that nations will never voluntarily disarm themselves.


I believe that's the plan yes.


Yes that sounds correct. The blockchain transactions will likely each represent hundreds or thousands of real economic transactions.


Satoshi supported what we would call a fee market. From the whitepaper:
*Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free*
Note that this was in 2009. Bitcoin is vastly better understood today than it was in 2009, or even in 2011. Satoshi may have created bitcoin but it's wrong to hold him as some kind of deity who wrote the holy scripture.


Absolutely. Without decentralization bitcoin is worthless. The high-fees are unfortunate but we can have our cake and eat it too by using off-chain transactions like hash-locked bidirectional payment channel (aka lightning), which retains all the decentralization properties of bitcoin while being far more efficient.


All developers see a low-fee high-block-size bitcoin as centralized and worthless. Some developers don't actually believe a fee market can provide long term miner security, although no replacement is known except by modifying the inflation rate. All developers see value in solutions like lightning and probably expect the majority of small transactions to be conducted there.
A great blog post to read about fees and incentives is this one: 
It describes the problem we face today that is convincing users to accept higher fees in order to fund network security.

There already are incentives to run a node. It's the only way to know for sure that all of bitcoin's rules are being followed.
If more coins than 21m are created or if a coin is spent more than one, all these lightweight wallets will happily go along with it.
Also full nodes provide the best privacy. All these lightweight wallets work by telling some third-party server which addresses are your.

I understand that big blockers are emotional and upset. But you have to understand that the same could be said for us anti-hard-fork people.
If you remember, BitcoinXT had blacklists, it would haved blocked tor, it would have raised block sizes to 8GB, it would have confused miner-majority with economic-majority and attempted to make SPV wallets go along with the hard fork, and finally it would have installed Mike Hearn as a dictator. Luckily XT is no more and most people recognize it was stupid, but you still have Bitcoin Classic today using many of the same tactics with many similar features.
So you can't go around saying you're hurt and emotional, because the same could be said for us. The price dropped every time it looked likely that a hard fork would happen, your games were costing people money. I've often said that if anyone believes in Bitcoin Classic then they are not true bitcoiners.
If you're talking about a riot (aka internet drama), remember that it has two sides. I don't see how you can expect the small block side to give up and capitulate when Bitcoin Classic still exists and it's not certain whether it will lose or not.
Give up your dreams of a miner-induced-hard-fork with Bitcoin Classic, then we can talk.

Fact is that AML/KYC works perfectly fine with physical cash. You can't just show up with a suitcase of money and buy a house, the same would be true with bitcoins.

Your post doesn't contain any technical details but I've heard the same idea in other places.
Fixing malleability for all old transactions requires changing the transaction format, and old coins can't be modified (because they're old). It's even worse when you think about time locked bitcoins which can't be moved even if the owner wanted.

For currency investors, the network effect is absolute because it is impossible to buy bitcoins and some altcoin with the same money. This is why analogies to other network effects, such as that between social networks like Facebook and G+, are spurious. It is possible to leverage the benefit of Facebook and G+ at the same time. I can, for example, write a single status update and then post it to both social networks at almost no additional cost.
Furthermore, there is very little long-term investment in the use of a social network. New status updates lose all value in hours. Message boards come and go. All it takes is to ignore Facebook for a few weeks before there is little to draw one back to it. The network effect for social networks is therefore tiny compared to that of currencies.

Welcome to reddit ijustmadethisup28(!)
From my reading of the situation, a hard fork is not a compromise. One side has nothing to gain from such a compromise.
There are many core developers who said they believe block size increases would be okay at some point. This plan is even in the [Core Scalability Roadmap](




So the idea that segwit would stop a block size increase is not right.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:02:49
Sorry but what honesty?
You've constantly been repeating the falsehood that segwit isn't a block size increase, and earlier you just tried to change the subject with me by saying *"So you're going to destroy bitcoin if you don't get your way?"*.

This proposed hardfork in particular is contentious because many people believe it's a bad idea.


75% of mining power is not economic consensus. We've been saying this for months, I don't know why big blockers still say this. Do you actually disagree with it? Because I've never heard a good argument against it, that's how the system technically works.
BTW, any threshold above 50% works the same because the mining majority could just orphan any disagreeing blocks.


If you're talking about so-called evil softforks, they are a case where the organised mining majority try to strongarm the economic majority into accepting it's changes. The economic majority could always organise itself and hardfork to a new PoW algorithm to cut out the existing miners.
Not to mention that if we've got a mining majority that organises itself for something like that, they could just do a 51% attack and kill bitcoin all the same.

This analysis forgets to mention the network effect/Metcalfe's law, where the value of a network goes as the square of its participants.
So if the economy is split 25:75 (= 1:3), their economic value and therefore price will be split 1:9. So the economic-majority-chain will have massive advantage 9x in price and hashrate.
Also, the segwit-invalid chain can be wiped out in a reorg if the segwit-valid chain gets longer. This can't happen to the segwit-valid chain. Therefore the segwit-invalid chain will have a lower price because its more risky to hold. Since hashpower follows price very closely the segwit-invalid chain won't last very long.


That's wrong. All the proposals for UASF say it should only happen with backing from the economic majority.


Because that's a hard fork, everybody must opt-in at the same time or we get a chain split. With UASF people can opt-in in their own time as long as the economic majority goes first.

Miners might want a new activation date, but it's unlikely that they'll get it. They should protect themselves by not mining or building on segwit-invalid blocks, which is easy to do.
If the segwit-invalid coin is not even liquid enough to trade then that bodes very badly for the survival of the segwit-invalid chain.
The economic majority already does things which are unacceptable to the miners. You remember after the first halvening there were some miners who continued mining 50btc blocks? They stopped doing that very quickly.
The miners work for the economy, not the other way around. The miners are vetoing segwit which the economy wants, so it's no surprise that the economy is thinking about other methods to activate it.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:54:12
Miners have a long history of following their economic incentives. Even though Jihan has engaged in all this huffing and puffing on twitter, he hasn't actually attempted a hard fork.
I don't think appealing to economic reasoning is handwaving given that the entire system functions that way. If the economic majority and the miners disagree then the miners will lose.
On the point of strikes, real life strikes require picket lines, intimidation and violence to prevent dissent. If a few miner pools break Jihan's strike he can't do anything.

It's always better to hold your bitcoins in your own wallet rather than using a trusted custodian like coinbase.com, bitcoin's history has countless examples of trusted third parties getting hacked or simply stealing coins under their care.

I recommend Electrum wallet for the newb user.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:22:57
If you don't want to make any transactions, you can do nothing.
If you want to make transactions (buy more bitcoins or sell some) then you need to use a full node wallet during the split to protect yourself from accepting fake bitcoins.
A full node checks that all the rules of bitcoin are followed. With a full node you can be sure that you've received true genuine bitcoins, if you use a lightweight wallet those bitcoins might be fool's gold.

Sorry but this is incredibly misleading.

If the segwit-valid chain has more value it will soon have more total work, because hashpower follows closely price.
If the segwit-valid chain has more total work, the segwit-invalid chain will be annihilated in a blockchain re-organization.
It's not enough for the segwit-invalid chain to have value, it must have **more** value. If the economic majority supports the segwit UASF then that will be true by definition.

Which other business is designed to require confirmation-in-one-block? From what I see most of them use a method of net-settlement (i.e. you send bitcoins to an exchange, do an unlimited number of transactions off-chain and then withdraw bitcoins in a single on-chain transaction)
Blocks sometimes take 60 minutes to be mined just by random chance. Being subject to the randomness of block creation just makes for a bad user experience.

The reason I bring it up is because a "soft fork" implies the mining power has decided, and economic majority would have to take special steps to reject a soft fork.
But this 21M limit raising by soft fork isn't like that at all, it still depends on the economic majority. So when you say *"Then I have news for you: You can change anything with soft-forks, even the 21M limit."* it is misrepresenting to people.

Yep. You will have to synchronize to the network which can take a few hours or days depending on your computing power. Make sure you have enough disk space to store the blockchain, you can use the -datadir flag to store it on another disk if required.
If you run with -dbcache=4096 (Assuming you have 4gb of ram) it will sync faster because it uses the hard disk less. If you run with -listen=0 you will use much less bandwidth after you've finished sync'ing.
PM me if you have any problems, I've done the process several times
Remember a full node only protects you if you actually use it as your wallet. You get the same protection if you tell an SPV client (like multibit) to connect only to your own node.


I'm not surprised. In times of peace many people are happy to trust electrum servers or SPV wallets. When times gets tough only a full node will do.

Miners don't contribute to network effect. They don't do much trading and commerce like actual bitcoin businesses do.
Remember bitcoin mining is very competative, so if Jihan and Antpool leaves then others can easily take their place.

Because miner fees are going up and that hurts the economy, they probably want scalability solutions like segwit and LN.


Miner's interests are not always aligned with users. These days miners are probably making a lot more income because miner fees have gone up.

Some points.
0) You may be right about better communication being needed. Although to the defense of core, the forums were filled with shills, votebots and an angry-mob that had all it's emotional buttons massaged by developers-turned-politicians like Mike Hearn.
1) The updates to a block size hard fork have to happen all at once, the updates to a segwit soft can be rolled out slowly as needed. This is one of the main reasons a soft fork is much safer which you completely missed.
2) Bitcoin does not have clients or servers. It is peer to peer (and not datacenter-to-datacenter as would have resulted from Mike Hearn's proposals.) The distinction is important.
3) Segwit does not introduce a new kind of address, it uses p2sh addresses which have existed at least since 2012.
4) People have been flagging the block size being raised for years but *it was rejected because it's a bad idea*. Until a week ago we were fighting off ideas to raise the block size to **8GB**.
5) The hard fork is not happening. We're a long way from that. Classic hasn't even written any code as of now.
6) Bitcoin is not a democracy and doesn't have elections. If you want to use a democratic currency, go use central bank money controlled by your favorite liberal democratic state. One of bitcoin's main value propositions is it may be able to resist tyranny of the majority.
7) Bitcoin on-chain transaction are not a good payment network. Every transaction must be flooded to every node in the network, which scales as O( N^2 ). The idea that all coffee purchases and online tips will be recorded on the blockchain is ridiculous. Rather than a payment network, bitcoin should aim to be digital gold; decentralized, censorship resistant and with monetary sovereignty.
What can replace credit cards and remittances, however, is a network of payment channels that routes payments instead of flooding them. Far more efficient, cheaper and confirms instantly instead of waiting for the next block. If you look, bitcoin core has been working on updates to help the Lightning project for months now, with BIP66, BIP68, BIP113, BIP65/OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and soon they'll adding be BIP112/OP_CSV. Was the OP aware of these?
Conclusion: OP is missing critical technical knowledge about bitcoin and probably does not agree with the fundamental value proposition of bitcoin being a decentralized currency. His ideas must be rejected.

I've never heard that and I think it's false. Segwit is useful beyond the block size increase because it fixes malleability, fixes the quadratic sighash bug, includes input values in signatures, allows script versioning etc.
So even if block space was plentiful those other features of segwit would get used almost immediately. (Hardware wallets for example are all very interested in input value signing)

Satoshi invented payment channels and coded the necessary requirements into bitcoin, so I wouldn't say he wanted everything to be on-chain.

The most important part is that you **use** your full node when you're receiving bitcoins. That will protect you from accepting any segwit-invalid coins, and make bitcoin as a whole harder to attack.
Here are some guides that often help
Reducing bandwidth usage: 
Add `prune=550` to the `bitcoin.conf` file to reduce disk space usage, see: 
Add `dbcache=M` where M is the number of megabytes of RAM to allocate, going up to 4000 or so can make it sync faster. The default is 500.

Have you ever talked to nonbitcoiners much? One of their first questions is usually *"how can this 21m thing be real? cant the coders just change the number"*. When you explain the economic consensus that many times you realise how important it is, its bad to have a currency constantly changing because of the whims of "the community". Any hard fork would reduce trust in the currency as an investment, especially in the case like we've got now were the vast majority of technical experts disagree. No, a successful hard fork would be very bad for bitcoin.

No because those nodes won't be doing any economic activity.

Actually this new code only makes it invalid for a block to not signal segwit activation with bip9. So if miners don't want their blocks rejected by the economic majority they must signal bip9 for segwit. (assuming of course that the economic majority supports this plan)
This means that after the flag day even the old Satoshi 0.13.1 nodes will start enforcing segwit. 


This is not possible, segwit transactions are non-standard under the old rules (see the CLEANSTACK rule). Which means it won't relay. 
The only way to get such a block mined is for the miner to include it in their own block. Since that will cause them to lose more than $15k at today's prices I very much doubt they'll be doing that.

It sounds like you're talking about lightning network but in a confused way.
Lightning network is a layer-2 protocol that goes on top of the bitcoin blockchain, it allows instant and very cheap bitcoin transactions without sacrificing much of the low-trust properties of bitcoin's blockchain.
It actually would benefit miners by making their mined bitcoins more valuable. Because of [Jevon's paradox]( their fee income would go up. Consider that it's very unlikely to pay $5 per bitcoin blockchain transaction to pay something, but it makes complete sense to pay $5 in fees for a payment channel opening that allows the user to make billions of transactions.

If you read the C++ code I linked above you'll see BIP16 was indeed done with a UASF. The code doesn't lie, before a certain date BIP16 was invalid and after that date it was valid. UASF doesn't involve versionbits and you'll note that the C++ code for BIP16 doesn't either. Before you disagree you'll have to show me where in the C++ source code for Bitcoin 0.6.0 is miner signalling referenced.
The concept of the economic majority has been known and understood at least since 2012 when Meni Rosenfield invented the phrase.
And finally, UASF doesn't involve any kind of signalling involving counting nodes, that's a complete myth and misunderstanding.

For currency investors, the network effect is absolute because it is impossible to buy bitcoins and some altcoin with the same money. This is why analogies to other network effects, such as that between social networks like Facebook and G+, are spurious. It is possible to leverage the benefit of Facebook and G+ at the same time. I can, for example, write a single status update and then post it to both social networks at almost no additional cost.
Furthermore, there is very little long-term investment in the use of a social network. New status updates lose all value in hours. Message boards come and go. All it takes is to ignore Facebook for a few weeks before there is little to draw one back to it. The network effect for social networks is therefore tiny compared to that of currencies.

The value proposition of bitcoin is the low amount of trust it requires which it achieves through decentralization.
Bitcoin's blockchain tech is fundamentally less efficient than centralized systems like paypal or western union, so it can't compete with on blockchain fees.
What's more, there's plenty of legitimate reasons to look for private transactions even if you're not breaking the law (If you don't agree with me then please upload your bank statement, since only shady people want privacy right?)

I don't think they are.
Soft forks have an asymmetry where the soft-fork-invalid chain can be wiped out one day. With a hard fork the two separate currencies will always exist, there is no situation where one currency is simply annihilated which is what happened to the bip66-accident coins. That's why it was so expensive to the miners, 25btc * 6blocks.

Miners don't enforce soft forks (or any of bitcoin's rules), all they do is choose the ordering and history of transactions, and signal for soft forks via the bip9 mechanism.

I think it has an easier UX because the user only needs to choose three (or two) parameters and not bother specifically with what the fee rate should be, or manually doing the fee bumping themselves.
The user chooses the maximum fee they're willing to pay, the max time they're willing to wait and the starting fee (which the wallet can replace with previous fee rates that were successfully confirmed minus 50%)

We don't know it's vulnerable. A contentious hard fork hasn't yet happened, let alone succeeded.
If it does, we will know for sure. However I'm confident that the economic consensus will see the dangers of a political hard fork and avoid it.
When you bring up the 50%+1 thing you're talking about mining, that has literally nothing to do with the economic consensus. Miners only preserve the history of all transactions, there's a lot they cannot do.
@_date: 2016-01-21 11:59:20
My understanding of an evil soft fork is miners mine nothing but empty blocks, with the extra information in some other block linked by a merkle root. Since no old-style transactions are happening, all nodes are convinced to update.
In that auxilary block, how do extra bitcoins get created? I thought the new "bitcoins" are not fungiable with the old ones (which are still limited to 21m)
@_date: 2016-01-22 14:48:49
Peter R's argument goes that there is a marginal cost of including a transaction for a miner because it increases the chance their block will become stale orphans. Therefore the transaction fee will have to be large enough to overcome this cost.
It's refuted in two ways. One is that another way to reduce orphans is for miners to centralize which is an unacceptable outcome would probably happen first before any rise in fees. Another refutation is that the orphaning cost is not a rent, it only balances out the miners loss from orphans. This means it wont be used to fund security for the network, which is the point of those fees.
As for your argument. Unless I'm misunderstanding it's an argument from consequences.


If anything, the problem of miners having no incentive to tick the chain forward is a good reason to have a block size limit.
@_date: 2016-01-22 23:42:16
Mostly people say "its not for noobs" because it takes a long time to initially set it up, and a newb who is not yet convinced of bitcoin's use is more likely to just give up on the idea entirely.

The price went up by 5x and reached a new all-time-high since the scalability conflict started. At the same time miner fees went up by 10x.
Miner fees are what will pay for the miners after inflation drops low, fees going up is good for the value of bitcoin because it keeps it secure. That's why the price went up with the miner fee rates.

That's impossible. Bitcoin is a flooding network where every transaction has to be relayed to every single node. An inherently inefficient design needed for trustlessness. The idea that every coffee purchase and online tip can be on the blockchain is ridiculous.
Luckily there are alternatives. Routing transactions instead of flooding them to everyone. It's much more efficient, cheaper and provides instant confirmations rather than waiting for the next block. This is what the Lightning project intends to do.

I agree with you. The way that holders and other users refuse to accept blocks that create more than 21m bitcoins is by asking their full nodes.
The reason miners don't create blocks that break the rules is that the economic majority will reject them in the same way a careful goldsmith rejects fool's gold.

I commented below this article on medium. With the major point being that Neutrino does not imply giving power to the miners. And also not having Neutrino also has costs (mostly with privacy, which is also a threat to your wealth if you get robbed)
It's also worth pointing out that the word Neutrino means many possible things:
1) BIP158 filters for local rescan 2) BIP158 filters over RPC 3) BIP157 protocol over P2P, for use by trusting clients (default off, maybe combined with authentication). 4) BIP157 protocol over P2P for the public. 5) 4)+softfork to commit to the filters.

The reason is they're doing SPV mining.
This means that for the first dozen or so seconds until AntPool verifies the last received block, it will mine on an empty block. This ultimately happens because downloading and verifying blocks is already a bit slow. Raising the block size to 2mb would make this problem worse.

You're getting it wrong way around. The developers would leave because bitcoin has failed, not, bitcoin has failed because the developers leave.
If a hard fork is successful without there being consensus, it means bitcoin has failed because it allowed itself to be pushed around by political forces. If a hard fork can happen because of a similar campaign of blog posts, reddit threads and flying to china to chat to miners, then even the 21m limit is not safe.

Miners can do what they like. The rules of bitcoin are enforced by the economic majority, [the vast majority of which run Bitcoin Core](
Antpool can create blocks above 1MB if they want, but no full node wallet will accept their fool's gold. Everyone wants the real thing, the genuine decentralized bitcoin.
This is a political move probably brought about by talk about UASF. The idea has obviously scared them. They probably believe the economic majority will buckle if some miners throw a tantrum, they are wrong.
It's a pity because he could just ignore the UASF if he doesn't want to mine segwit transactions for some reason. UASF are opt-in, miner's only need to protect themselves from mining segwit-invalid blocks.
Reminder of when Roger Ver's pool accidentally created fool's gold because of a bug in BU:  The only result was that the pool lost 13.2 bitcoins (worth just under $13k at the time)

This is incorrect. The Core Scalability Roadmap contains a plan to increase the block size after the near-term improvements are done.


Much of the Roadmap is actually about on-chain scalability, for example schnorr signatures, MAST and transaction cut-through.


It wouldn't be a one-time increase since we know the same people asking for it were previously asking for 8GBs (gigabytes with a G). If you read their literature they have no intention of stopping at 2MB.
Not to mention, how do you do a "safe" hard fork? Nobody knows, nobody has any idea. Other altcoins tried a hard fork and ended up splitting their currency in two.

In that case you'll be trusting the electrum server.
Not moving your coins sucks as a solution since money is pointless if you can't spend/move it.

I disagree strongly with this.

No that's completely wrong. Bitcoin is not a *"completely trust the miners"* system and never has been. If it was then miners could print infinite bitcoins, confiscate coins or other stuff like that.

No they can't end the debate because there's plenty of non-Core developers (like me) who disagree with a hard fork to raise the block size right now.

I agree with you about not downvoting dissenting views just because they disagree. On the other hand here's a counterargument to this point:


For currency investors, the network effect is absolute because it is impossible to buy bitcoins and some altcoin with the same money. This is why analogies to other network effects, such as that between social networks like Facebook and G+, are spurious. It is possible to leverage the benefit of Facebook and G+ at the same time. I can, for example, write a single status update and then post it to both social networks at almost no additional cost.
Furthermore, there is very little long-term investment in the use of a social network. New status updates lose all value in hours. Message boards come and go. All it takes is to ignore Facebook for a few weeks before there is little to draw one back to it. The network effect for social networks is therefore tiny compared to that of currencies.

Off-chain allows instant very-cheap transactions at very high transactions-per-second (millions if you're in the same room). They have much of the same low-trust properties like on-chain transactions and they are also more private.
Why is on-chain so important when the benefits of off-chain are so big?
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:30:19


Bitcoin already does something like this. Before it sends the entire transaction or block it sends an `inv` command with the hash, if the other peer replies with a `getdata` then your peer will start uploading the entire transaction or block.
O( N^2 ) is required because of the trustless security model of bitcoin. In a system with no central server, who checks the rules are being followed? We all do! So every new bit of information must be flooded to every node in the network.
But if you can think of a way to make it O(nlogn) please tell someone about it(!) My hopes are not high since people have been thinking about this since 2009 but it's always worth another mind giving it a go.

It's core developer policy to not include many features (ideally none) in the same release as a soft fork. It takes away possible reasons for why a soft fork might be illegitimate.

Increasing the block size only increase the scale, not the scalability. The difference is important and sadly often overlooked.

Sorry but please read the history before saying such incorrect and false things. 
p2sh was activated by 55% of miner signalling, not 95%
And it wasn't an "insignificant" minority against it.
The 55% hashpower support resulted in p2sh-invalid blocks being mined for months afterwards, far from "extremely quick".
A community wasn't built only because bitcoin was smaller then and the political maneuvering wasn't as good.


The proposal Luke supported was called bip17
[Since then many people have changed their mind and said luke's idea was better.](
The same kind of tactics that Gavin used back then was attempted to be used when the block size conflict started in summer 2015. The false sense of urgency, the dire exaggerated warnings, etc
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:12:23
If the segwit-valid chain ends up with more work, then the segwit-invalid chain will be annihilated in a big re-org.
So the miner minority can't keep the chain alive. That's because segwit is a soft fork while BU is a hard fork.
Hashpower closely follows price, so for the UASF side to win the segwit-valid coins need to have a higher price than the segwit-invalid coins i.e. the UASF needs to be supported by the economic majority.

OK i get it now. B can still has his entire 100 auxiliary-btc amount on the auxiliary-chain. But C gets 50btc extra to play with on the real blockchain.
So yes it's a kind of fractional reserve. These auxiliary-btc are backed by real btc but there's not enough real btc to honor them all.
Auxiliary-btc are distinguishable from real-btc. To spend them, users still needs to find exchanges and merchants to trade with, and they all need to update their nodes, so it has exactly the same economics as a hard fork. It's not possible for old users to be tricked into accepting auxiliary-btc as real ones.
I'm confident that the economic consensus will not go for fractional reserve coins, they'll always want the real thing. Transaction fees are not the only feature that people look for in a currency.

If you mean protecting your coins from being stolen by malware. I recommend looking into multisig wallets. 


If you want to protect your coins from the turmoil of a hard fork, there is not much you can do unless you agree to freeze your coins and not spend them while the hard fork is in action. If you try to spend your coins, it is possible you they will only transfer on one side of the hard fork and you will end up with two incompatible coins. Unfortunately this is the reality, it is why many people are against a contentious hard fork.

Remember that much of the economy has already upgraded to Satoshi 0.13.1 nodes (~80% of nodes according to Luke's crawler) and they would also enforce the new rules. That's why I'd say ~6 months isn't as risky as it would be with a mere flag day. If the exchanges and other big businesses say they support this update.
Remember that from release to activation, P2SH was just *1 month*. Of course there are many differences and I'm not suggesting this goes like p2sh, but it should make us think about the speed of updates.
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:20:24

Hard forks are safe if there is consensus about them. I should have said "contentious hard forks" in my above post, apologies for that.
Bitcoin has never hard forked in the past, even many of Satoshi's updates were only soft forks.


Because such a "centerist" proposal won't be accepted. It's like asking that the compromise is to only be stabbed with a 2 inch knife instead of a 6 inch knife. A 2MB hard fork doesn't help a large faction of the bitcoin community at all, so it won't happen.
Also please stop using the phrase leadership. Bitcoin doesn't have leaders, that's a big part of its value proposition. It might be hard to get used to a leaderless decentralized project but that's what bitcoin is.


Because those "simple" solutions don't work and would destroy bitcoin. See the various transcripts and talks from the bitcoin conferences, as well as all the mailing list discussions.

Ok, but the coins created by the auxiliary block do not appear to nodes which have not updated. The two kinds of coins are not fungible.

I suppose there's no way to convince you until it actually happens (if segwit isn't blocked indefinitely)
But I know bitcoin users today have to put up with the non-instant transactions, the blockchain record visible to everybody and recently high miner fees, so I can easily see people adopting LN to help solve those problems.


I can't see it being any different from running a bitcoin node or bittorrent client. It should be fairly easy to argue that LN nodes don't hold anybody else's money. But I'm not a lawyer.
LN could be run over tor so any potential legal action would be unenforceable if people could just hide.


Well if you have your money in bitcoin's blockchain you can still only transfer it other bitcoin users. If you wanted to you could say owning bitcoin is "locking up" value.
A user of USD might say *"why should I lock up my money in this bitcoin thing when I can only transfer it to other bitcoin users"*.
Lightning is even better than USD/BTC because that exchange rate fluctuates while LN still uses 1/1 bitcoins.
The only difference I see is LN's network will start off smaller than bitcoin's blockchain network. But it will grow, I think.

If the economic consensus backs the 10% mining power chain, the few miners who remain will be able to collect 100% of the new bitcoins.

It contributes a lot. It means you won't accept fake bitcoins for payment and therefore reduces the incentives for miners to even attempt breaking the rules.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:07:22
The incentive is that hubs require capital and a mesh network doesn't. That capital has an opportunity cost which isn't there if a mesh network is used.

If you took cash banknotes or gold coins as payment, you wouldn't accept them without carefully verifying that the banknotes were genuine and that the gold was real. The same is true with bitcoin, payments must be genuine or else you might be left out of pocket.
For a bitcoin to be genuine, it must follow all the rules of the bitcoin network. Rules like:
* Nobody ever spent coins without holding the private key.
* Nobody spent the same coins twice.
* Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for miners, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
* Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
Only a full node under your control give you certainty that all these rules of Bitcoin are followed, which therefore checks that your incoming payments are genuine. There are small scale attacks possible where you may be left holding fake bitcoins that have no value and disappear soon after.
But if an bad actor were ever to attack Bitcoin in this way, it would likely be an attack on the entire currency rather than your single wallet. So if Bitcoin is valuable to you, and you want to see it survive then it is helpful to use a full node for your transactions, not a payment processor or lightweight wallet. If you have a lot of economic weight (make lots of transactions) then its even more important.

This is not a matter of opinion that you can just disagree with. This is how the bitcoin system works on a technical level.
It's like saying *"I disagree that anti-counterfeiting laws are necessary for a fiat currency system"*, you can disagree all you want but if you repeal those laws then fake banknotes will appear regardless. It's the same with full nodes: the system's security depends on most merchants using them when receiving payments.

Bitcoin was always intended to work like this. After the block subsidy goes to zero, miners will have to be funded by transaction fees only.
Have you read this?  In the beginning transaction fees were low which was needed to bootstrap the currency, but that can't last forever.


If the blocksize is as high as you write here, two things would happen.
1) Miners could never be funded. Smart-contract-based, routed payments are very cheap indeed. On-chain transactions competing with them would not be able to fund network security.
2) Bitcoin would be centralized. A p2p flooding network can only support such a huge rate if the only nodes as run on datacenters, like how Gavin wrote a few posts above.
It's not that bitcoin core is nasty and wants everyone to pay more money for the lulz. It's that bitcoin cant technically work in any other way and still have attractive properties.

Your estimation isn't right because there are some transactions that combine a lot of inputs into one output to merge them, they take up a lot more block space.

Miners can't be allowed to do this otherwise bitcoin's decentralization will be destroyed.
Those miners might also *"want to freely control the supply of bitcoins"*, and they also won't be allowed to do that for the same reasons.


If miners have leverage over bitcoin's rules then bitcoin has failed in its aim of being a low-trust currency.
If miners take this route, all they'll do is motivate the economic majority to put it's foot down with a UASF.


You've got this backwards
* Exchanges don't care about any drama on reddit/twitter coming from the scaleability conflict.
* Exchanges DO care about rising miner fees because it's a significant cost for them. Segwit is an update that would increase the supply of block space and thus lower the miner fees. Remember that the first person to reply to the UASF on the developer mailing list was a BitGo's engineer.
If miners continue to block updates in order to increase their miner fee income, it wouldn't be surprised that it motivates the economy to do a UASF to lower their fees.

Maybe it's $10 per typical blockchain transaction or something. Bitcoin gambling is almost entirely priced out. Owners of bitcoin casinos are faced with bankrupcy, or doing something like a UASF or PoW HF.
Now, a PoW HF requires the same (or ever more) co-ordination than a UASF. So if we can do a HF we can also do a UASF. And that has the added advantages that lightweight wallets which check the PoW don't need to be updated, and also its a soft fork so not every single node needs to be updated.

That's not true, plenty of people opposed p2sh and preferred luke-jr's alternative proposal. Also some people opposed CLTV and CSV because those are required for LN and these people are against LN.
But it doesn't matter. For soft forks, either one of the mining majority or the economic majority matters.

It's not a hard fork because the rules are backward- and forward-compatible, instead it's a soft fork.
I think what you're actually asking is whether it could cause a chain split. The answer is yes but the economic forces should make it not happen or heal soon after. So similar to the accidental chain fork soon after the bip66 soft fork.

Looking at OP's post history, he is the one who came up with the famous idea of 51% attacking the Core chain to force people to adopt BU.
This guy ran several bitcoin businesses but I bet didn't contribute to helping fund core developer. Now his mind is filled with Blockstream conspiracy theories after some of them have found VC funding.
And now he has the nerve to come into r/bitcoin to get technical advice on how to run his gift card businesses. Obviously his friends over at rbtc can't help him with issues like that.
I'm thinking the OP doesn't give a shit about bitcoin's decentralization properties and just want to be free to fill up the blockchain with small transactions that everyone else has to pay for and verify forever.
Correct me if I'm wrong OP, I know you're mind is filled with misinformation, but here you are [saying that blockstream will physically attack miners](

As this article writes, your incentive is that you know for sure that all of bitcoin's rules are being followed. It gives you certainty that you're being paid with actual genuine bitcoins and not some fakes.
A further incentive is that you have better privacy, because a full node downloads the entire blockchain and scans it locally, so no third-party will learn which addresses are in your wallet.
A final incentive is that you are protected from certain classes of attacks which affect lightweight wallets but not full node wallets.

Sounds fine, but how do you transfer across the unsigned transactions?

The transactions could be unmixed if every other user colludes, or if other privacy issues leak more information (for example, users might recombine their coinjoined outputs together later). It's not very likely but that's how someone would attempt it.
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:09:29
Pretty much the same thing. You could "update" your transaction by sending a modified one with a higher sequence number, or set it to final by making the sequence number MAX_INT.
Problem was, the miner had no incentive to follow this rule, also it was a DOS vector because someone could make the network send millions of these transactions so it was disabled around 2010. RBF fixes these problems by making updated transactions only relay if their fee is higher, which also gives incentives for miners to mine it.

Well if a large part of the economic majority of bitcoin supports a UASF then miners will have to follow it. As long as the price of the segwit-valid coin is higher than the segwit-invalid coin then soon enough the segwit-invalid bitcoin will be reorg'd out, so the split will heal itself.
From what I see politically, miners will never signal for segwit so the only way we'll ever get it is with a UASF.

It makes sense, many people already pay fees in other parts of bitcoin that are far higher than today's miner fee.
Imagine a purchase of VPN services that uses bitcoin's privacy and anti-censorship properties. The users have to pay the bid-ask spread twice to get into and out of bitcoin, which in general is far higher than the miner fee.
Plus many people buy extra bitcoins to guard against price volatility (imagine being $0.10 short of what the VPN costs). Volatility itself adds costs which are higher than the miner fees.

If you took cash banknotes or gold coins as payment, you wouldn't accept them without carefully verifying that the banknotes were genuine and that the gold was real. The same is true with bitcoin, payments must be genuine or else you might be left out of pocket.
For a bitcoin to be genuine, it must follow all the rules of the bitcoin network. Rules like:
* Nobody ever spent coins without holding the private key.
* Nobody spent the same coins twice.
* Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for miners, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
* Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
Only a full node under your control give you certainty that all these rules of Bitcoin are followed, which therefore checks that your incoming payments are genuine. There are small scale attacks possible where you may be left holding fake bitcoins that have no value and disappear soon after.
But if an bad actor were ever to attack Bitcoin in this way, it would likely be an attack on the entire currency rather than your single business. So if Bitcoin is valuable to you, and you want to see it survive then it is helpful to use a full node for your transactions, not a payment processor or lightweight wallet. If you have a lot of economic weight (make lots of transactions) then its even more important.
Today we see threats on the network. Some miners want to attack bitcoin and bring it under their control because they want to break some of bitcoin's rules. That's why this thread was posted now.

BU is fundamentally flawed at protocol level, full of destructive bugs and contains no safety mechanisms for the hardfork whatsoever (even replay attack mitigation, wipeout protection or a flag day). This has been explained to BU supporters many times and yet they still push people to run BU. The exchanges said they would not list BU coin unless they at least fix replay attacks and they refused, some even claimed replay attacks are good. A bug in BU allowed anyone to remotely shut down all the nodes, yet after that they still campaigned for people to run BU and the BU hashrate still climbs.
And yet doesn't say "BU is the most absurd and reckless thing" he's heard. Instead changing the PoW is that. I shake my head.

Nah, this very expensive. The miners could mine empty blocks on the chain they don't like but that will cost them a massive amount of electricity and ASIC opportunity cost. And when they stop the attack that chain goes back to normal again.

@_date: 2017-03-31 09:52:27


That's the point. Support of the economic majority translates to higher value/liquidity. And remember hashpower follows price.
In the event where a miner chooses to start a chain split, the UASF chain would accumulate more work until it had greater work than the non-UASF chain which would be annihilated in a big re-org.
The fact that such a re-org is even possible will mean the non-UASF chain will have a lower price all else equal, to compensate for the risk. It's a positive feedback cycle that ends with any chain split being healed.

I strongly approve of fraud proofs. This is what I think we should do going on from here.
One of the future extensions made possible by segwit is the creation fraud proofs for the rules of *"no spending a coin that doesnt exist"* and *"no creating more coins than allowed"*. See [this section]( in the bip document. It's also mentioned in the segregated witness talk at at ScalingBitcoin conference in Hong Kong, see [slide 14 here]( (Fraud Proofs) and the full talk is [here](
If this is implemented in bitcoin, then all consensus rules will be possible to create fraud proofs for.
If fraud proofs are something that everyone can agree on, then I hope everyone will join me in helping segwit become activated on the bitcoin mainnet. The on-chain-scaling side's opposition to segwit is counterproductive if they advocate for fraud proofs.

The issue there wasnt bloom filters per se, but how they were implemented in a non-ideal way.
For example they usually added the pubKey and pubKeyHash to the filter. That means if the spy matches a possible pubKey, they can calculate the pubKeyHash too and see if the filter matches too. It reduces the false positive rate from fp to fp^2

We've heard it all before, the calls for a "necessary" block size hard fork. Mike Hearn's blog posts used that word back in summer 2015.
It's not necessary, bitcoin is doing great. It's value has increased 5x recently to reach a new all-time-high.
One side gains nothing from the kind of compromise you're thinking of. They would rather leave everything as it is. What are the downsides of not going for the compromise and instead going for the flag day activation? I don't see any downsides. The hostile miners are only talking about compromise now because a flag day scares them.

Yes they do, because otherwise bitcoin would stop being decentralized.

This is misleading in the extreme.
In 2010 someone produced a contrived transaction that made a billion bitcoins out of thin air. Users applied a fix for that bug, and naturally the network reorged to exclude that transaction after a majority of hashpower was fixed. No normal funds were confiscated, the network wasn't hardforked. Old clients continued to operate.
By contrast there have been many large services that lost tons of coin (including mtgox's insolvency which was on the order of 10% of all existing coins), large losses in mybitcoin, bitcoinica and many other cases. No one called for a network bailout in these cases and if they had they would have been laughed at. These cases are the closer parallel to the situation with ethereum.

No we don't.
There's nothing that says bitcoin *needs* to scale on-chain, especially in light of [arguments that the block size is already too big](
I think a lot of people object to the idea that the difficulty of on-chain scaling is a problem. From the point of view of many bitcoiners, the fact that it's hard to increase the block size is a feature.

Full node wallets check all the consensus rules of bitcoin transactions and blocks, and so stop fake bitcoins from being accepted by the economy. Therefore full node wallet operated by the user under their own control on their own hardware have to be used by most of the economy or else bitcoin has no security.

To save bandwidth for the lightweight wallet.


 It's possible to check whether the block-without-witnesses corresponds to a block header.


Client-side block filters also resist lies-by-omission, such lies are dangerous for lightning wallets because they can lead to the wallet not seeing an invalid channel close.

"not your keys not your bitcoin" is not fully true. Absolute control over your bitcoins also requires a wallet backed by a full node.
Usually what people do with hardware wallets is have the hardware device hold the private keys but have it connect only to their own full node, rather than some third-party server out there.
@_date: 2018-10-25 22:30:16

Bitcoin is voluntary. There's no stealing here.
Miners will need an income after all 21 million coins have been mined. That won't happen unless block size is limited. A small block size is also needed so that full nodes are possible to run by everyone who needs them which keeps the entire thing decentralized.
Fact is that a block size limit is an arbitrary limit which is very important for bitcoin to stay a decentralized censorship-resistant digital currency.
You're right that this requires blockchain transactions to cost fees, but welcome to real world. In the real world bitcoin runs on physical computers that use real bandwidth and real energy.
It costs fees, but it's worth it. Soon enough they'll be the Lightning Network which brings instant and cheap transactions.

The transaction ID is different.
In an ECDSA signature, a valid s value will also be valid if replaced by N - s (known as the high-S).
Ever since that malleability-yolo-skiddie-troll period in November 2015, transactions with high-s values in their signatures are non-standard and wont be relayed. This stops a troll randomly malleating and rebroadcasting transactions, but doesn't stop a malicious miner mining the other txid into a block and using it to cause trouble.

So all the attacking miners have to do is spin up a few hundred listening full nodes and serve up their fake blocks. Easy, costs no more than a few hundreds dollars per year.

Bitcoin's decentralization is the only thing that makes it special. It's more than an ideological difference, it's the very property that makes bitcoin worth something at all. We don't need a shitty copy of paypal, we need decentralized digital currency.

I disagree with that, it takes a very big fall in hashrate to produce that situation.
If bitcoin loses a massive 75% of it's hashrate its block time only goes up to 40 minutes on average. If a portion of the economy really believes that this chain is the true bitcoin, they will tolerate those longer block times for a couple of weeks until the difficulty readjusts. Blocks today already take 40 minutes sometimes to appear, there's no fundamental difference between 10 minutes and 40 minutes. So no the longer difficulty readjustments won't help the miners much if they decide to attack bitcoin by attempting a hostile hard fork.
In fact if the economy is really with the original chain, it's token will be more valuable than thus miners might even jump back to that chain.
Now the question is, does Core and Segwit have the economy on it's side? We see from  that a hundred services and projects are ready, willing and ever eagar for segwit, including big names like localbitcoins, coinbase.com and BitGo. The economy is with Core, everyone wants Core coins and nobody wants BU coins. If the miners go against this they will mostly only harm themselves.
@_date: 2017-01-26 03:04:12
So what? Blocks will take 40 minutes for a while but it will be worth it.
Bitcoin's blockchain is already a bad payment network. It doesn't allow instant settlement, blocks already have a nonzero probability of taking 40 minutes to be found.
People already complain about unconfirmed transactions taking a long time today, 40 minutes isn't fundamentally different from 10 minutes. And once 8 weeks passes we're back to normal. If miners jump back to the real bitcoin which I suspect they will then we'll get back to normal even sooner.
As an investor and holder I will sell the forked chain because I know that bitcoin is valuable as a low-trust currency, miners trying to attack my blockchain cannot shake that simple fact.
The longer difficulty readjustment won't save you. If you attempt a contentious hard fork then Bitcoin will split in two just like Ethereum did. One of the reasons bitcoin is valuable is because the miners don't have the power to push users around and impose their own rules.

We can ignore orphaning effects for four reasons, orphaning increases as a function of transaction load can be ~completely eliminated with relay technology improvements, and if not that by miners centralizing.. and if all a miners income is going to pay for orphaning losses there will be no excess paying for competition thus security, and-- finally-- if transaction fees are mostly uniform, the only disincentive from orphaning comes from the loss of subsidy, which will quickly become inconsequential unless bitcoin is changed to be inflationary.


Why is the block interval not 5 minutes or 20 minutes? The reason is the same: it's an engineering tradeoff.
Miners are NOT there to ensure anything about the blocks, it's full nodes that do that. Miners are only there to choose the ordering of transactions.


Is it also censorship to stop the miners printing infinite bitcoins? Of course not. Go back to the playpen of r/btc

21 million is just as arbitrary as 1MB or 10 minutes. The limits were put in by the system's creator because bitcoin simply can't work without them.
Bitcoin operates in the real world, it runs in physical machines that require bandwidth and cost energy, relying on incentives that follow real human decision-making. If miners can't charge fees then bitcoin nobody will mine after all 21million coins have been created.

Word. Roger's transaction had 605 inputs and was 89 kilobytes in size which is why it's so expensive.
Enter the schnorr algorithm. Schnorr would allow signature aggregation, where instead of having 605 signatures, a transaction like that would have just one. That's right, a single signature. That would result in a smaller transaction size and only one elliptic curve operation. That results in less load on the network and therefore a lower miner fee. Schnorr would be great for businesses like Roger's that often combine together many inputs, so it's astonishing to me at why he is a key figure in this movement to block segwit (which is necessary for schnorr).

If a miner mines an invalid block they are simply not mining bitcoin.
It's exactly the same situation if a miner mines a block that creates 50btc. If they try to send those bitcoins to an exchange, the exchange's full node wallet will detect the invalid block and reject it, and reject the miner's 50btc. The miner's 50btc will be worth exactly zero because they can't trade it for any goods or services.
So to be clear, a miner must issue include the block's witness data otherwise they won't get paid for any their work.

Yes there is a need. Bitcoin requires most of the economy to be using full node wallets for its long-term survival.

Not really, I mean blocks are already slow anyway (10 minutes is far too slow for instant payments) so most of the time people just wait around. Waiting an average of 40 minutes isn't too different from waiting 10 minutes.
And it's only temporary until the retarget, then we're mostly back to normal.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:44:48
Miner fees are paid on a per-byte (or after segwit per-weight-unit) basis, so it ends up being that you pay proportional the number of payments you received in the past.
Under the hood bitcoin works by having digital coins, a single coin with a face value of 5000btc costs the same to spend as a single coin with a face value of 0.002 btc. So if you received many payments of 0.002btc then it will be costlier to spend them. Generally people wait for low-demand periods to combine all these coins, like at the weekends.

This article would benefit by talking about the problem of sync'ing a wallet privately. That idea is almost never brought up in articles like these.
It talks about using "Use a bitcoin wallet on your own computer, rather than a web wallet." but lightweight wallets like Electrum reveal all their addresses to the Electrum server. The server operator can spy on them by simply grepping their logs.
A full node wallet downloads the entire blockchain and scans it for it's own addresses, this means no third-party server can tell what the user's addresses are like they can with Electrum.

Just so it's understood; Txoset means transaction output set, which is a set of all transactions made in Monero since the beginning of time. It will grow as O(transactions) ~ O(time)
Bitcoin's utxoset is the *unspent* transaction outputs. It grows as O(unspent coins) ~ O(number of users)
The crucial difference is that bitcoin knows which coins have been spent so it can delete them when pruning which improves the scaling of it compared to monero.
Not to talk it down, just so that everyone is aware of the tradeoffs.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:42:21
This is bullish for the price.
Holders and investors (who mostly decide what the price is) rarely make transactions and when they do are happy to pay a few dollars to transfer the swiss bank account in their pocket.
As bitcoin's inflation drops, miners will have to move to being funded by transaction fees. It's always been an open question whether this idea will actually work. Fees going up show that it will work, which is why in 2015-2017 the price rallied at the same time as miner fees going up.
People who make lots of transactions shouldn't worry, very soon segwit will be activated and allow LN to be used (which is already usable on testnet if you want to try it out)

Security is more a function of how decentralized is the mining power, not what its absolute level is. It's a fact that mining was more decentralized in the GPU era in 2011 than today with ASICs.
The miners are being paid millions of dollars per day by the economy in order to provide transactions that are highly irreversible, but due to the level of centralization they are not doing this job well.
I advocate a PoW change today, but it looks like it won't be able to achieve consensus. If the miners actually started censoring transactions and demanding ID information then this consensus could be much more easily found.

Bitcoin is not bittorrent. Upload/download bandwidth isn't the only resource here.

Handling your own private keys directly is not recommended because they behave in un-intuitive ways. See these stackexchange answers

Thanks for posting, it's good to have honestly-held alternative views that don't cause disruption even if we disagree.
I don't think what the 148ers did with UASF can be used for evil because of the first point in that blog post: *"Take away no existing useful features (do not create a hostile minority)."*.
So for example if someone tried to do the same thing to add KYC/AML to bitcoin's base layer, they would face substantial resistance from everybody who wants to use bitcoin without registering their real life ID somewhere (which is many many people), so that attempted UASF wouldn't succeed.

Only on average, the blocks times follow an exponential distribution with mean 10 minutes: 
But you're right in spirit, the bitcoin blockchain does not support instant irreversible transactions. But (see what follows) it can have layer-2 protocols on top that do allow this.


Bitcoin will grow by layers. The blockchain is a very secure layer-1 protocol that allows more efficient layers to be built on top.
For a long term plan see the Core Scaling Roadmap:  I appreciate it can be quite technical so if you have any questions feel free to ask.
There have been people advocating for an increase of the block size limit, but the community has rejected this idea because it has bad tradeoffs. See this writeup for why scaling by multiple layers is a better idea: 
Will this work? Maybe, we hope so. If you're buying bitcoin as an investment this is part of the risk you take. My view is that even if bitcoin doesn't take over all other currencies it will still exist and have a value.

No way, there's plenty of people (myself included) who would never and will never approve of a 2MB hard fork. The only way reason many of us support segwit is because it fixes some serious bugs like the quadratic scaling issue and malleability.

Decentralization is a means to an end. That end is a low requirement for trust.
Consider how the code is centrally hosted on github, but its still very trustless because it's open source and anybody can read it. For example, the bitcoin software cannot have a secret command to send all the money to one person because that command would be seen by any reviewer.

Not all transactions will be on the blockchain. The rest will be on layer-2 systems like Lightning Network.
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:33:02
Basically all of those are oversimplified or false:


It's much more complicated than this. Channels are bidirectional so you can receive money as well as send it.


This is not true at all. LN can use indefinite channel durations that could stay open forever.




This is not true. Channels are bidirectional so once you receive bitcoins you can spend them straight away.


LN itself existing is a massive improvement in scalability. So the open and close transactions are bigger than the typical ones (although smaller than many others) but those transactions on the blockchain can represent millions of transactions off-chain.
Lightning DOES have some caveats. Here's one I could think of but there could be more:
* Lightning only works if both sender and receiver are online. So you can't spray-paint an address onto a wall and have people send money there with LN. People would probably use on-chain transactions for this (or another off-chain technology, like chaumian ecash which does support offline payments)
* Lightning doesn't work well for cold storage. If you want to store bitcoins for long periods its better to close the payment channel and transfer the coins to a paper backup or hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:37:21
Next time can you be clearer with what your question actually is. Read this guide: 
For example you can't just say "it didnt work" without giving details and expect an answer.
Are you asking "how long does an unconfirmed transaction take to expire" ? By default transactions are held in node's mempools for two weeks. Once an unconfirmed transaction has expired from a mempool then the node will accept it and relay it again. However this two weeks is only local policy, individual node operators can configure their nodes to expire transactions in less or more time, of course in practice very few will.

Yes, lightning censorship resistance is a much-discussed topic. Look up the other blog posts, it's been discussed a lot.
Lightning nodes can be run by anyone, even behind tor. If some nodes try to censor payments they can be routed around. And if all else fails people can always make a blockchain transactions.

A full node wallet is the only way to use bitcoin in a trustless way. A full node verifies all the rules of bitcoin and rejects invalid transactions in the same way a careful goldsmith rejects fool's gold.
To put simply, using a full node wallet is like checking your banknotes are genuine and your gold coins are real before accepting them as payment.
Also there are privacy and security benefits.

It could be painful but not fatal.
If bitcoin loses 75% of hash power then block intervals go up to 40 minutes from 10 minutes. In the worst case the retarget takes 8 weeks instead of 2 weeks, and after that we're back to normal. 8 weeks isn't that much compared to the 8 years that bitcoin has existed.

You could say that by using bitcoin you've already signed up soft forks, because it has programmed in it capability to do them. It has the unused opcodes that were used for OP_CLTV and OP_CSV.

Think about what's the point of validating if you can't make economic decisions based on it.
Imagine if you had a lightweight wallet and were trading bitcoin for cash in person. A person you trade with has a deal with a miner who creates an invalid block which steals someone else's bitcoin and sends it to you, your lightweight wallet can't detect this and so displays "Payment received" as normal and you give the trader the cash.
Maybe you have a full node running somewhere which validates the rules and rejects the miners invalid block, but it doesn't help you one bit because your lightweight wallet was actually used for economic activity and resulted in you handing over cash and not getting real bitcoins in return.

Look at the example of Ethereum's attempted hard fork. Ethereum's miners overwhelmingly supported the new chain but the ethereum currency still fractured into two blockchain, with the price of both dropping way down.


Because miners and the economy have different interests. Miners print money and want to print as much of it as possible, the economy doesn't want that. That's just one example.
Note that the important thing is how much of the economy supports each chain, they express their support by using a full node wallet and being willing to trade goods and services for coins on that chain. The number of nodes out there on the network doesn't matter, it can be easily faked anyway.

Right now bitcoin is a bit of a pain to use, the only people that bother are those for whom bitcoin really really helps. e.g. permissionless global  online gambling which is something paypal *cannot* do.
If a business' marginal utility of accepting bitcoin is so small that merely running a full node puts them off then they should not accept bitcoin. Instead they should wait for LN maturity, better wallets, better UX, lower volatility, etc

But we can't agree if we think it's not the best scalability option(!)
I don't think adding more arbitrary upper limits is a good idea for example.

Indeed this inertia is a massive part of what protects consensus rules like the 21m limit and no-double-spending.
Another thing, the 4x discount is for all witnesses. Every transaction has a witness part, indeed it makes up half of most transactions by size.

How this should be done: all wallets, exchanges, marketplaces, casinos, services and other websites should allow the user to choose which unit they want to use.

Good blog post but


Ethereum is significantly premined, it's permanently-inflationary and has a central dictator. Ethereum's creators receive quite a substantial chunk of newly-mined coins every year, no matter what.
Choosing to hold Ethereum is just swapping one centralized form of money with another.
edit: ethereum currently is also far less liquid and fungiable, as the shapeshift hacker found out

Honestly I feel kind of bad. I didn't realize there even were people who were against segwit and also against hard forks, and only for the status quo.
In that situation, you still have power to stop BIP148 by making your own UASF, which would have *required* at least one non-BIP141-signalling block after 1st August. If you organized enough and found enough other people who agree with you then BIP148 could have been stopped.

That's like asking "Do you think Japan would have lost WWII had it not signed the surrender on 2nd September 1945" ?
Maybe the Japanese can congratulate themselves saying "Well, the war wouldn't have ended without our signature". But fact is that the US dropped two atomic bombs on their cities and was ready to invade the Japanese mainland.
Here's a quote I've been throwing around on this topic: *"The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting." ~Sun Tzu*
The UASF movement achieved all it's aims. I don't care what backroom deals the miners had to do amongst themselves, because it makes no difference.

Smaller blocks propagate faster.
I think I've seen some data on it, there's this talk but I was thinking of something else: 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:09:21
Even on a normal computer it takes very long, and it gets worse with every block adding 1MB of additional data to verify (2-3MB soon when segwit activates)
And why shouldn't raspberry pi users have the right to validate the blockchain? Stop trying to reduce the security of bitcoin when we know about LN and so can do it a safer way.
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:27:45
Yes pretty much. Although in bitcoin &gt;50% of miners is enough to censor any transaction (because they can make stale other miner's blocks by not building on top of them)
It's just a worst-case scenario that nobody really thinks it very likely.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:49:51
That's also another issue. Core already has code to make this analysis harder by randomly slowing down transaction propagation. But to do that kind of attack you need to mass-connect to many many nodes on the p2p network, and as you can appreciate, that's much harder than simply grepping your Electrum server logs.
Also you could download the blockchain normally but could broadcast your transactions through tor. JoinMarket has code which does this and then your IP address can't be linked with your transaction.

Saying "the project is open to PR" isn't the same thing as saying the project is correct in it's conclusions.
If a threat model puts a blockchain.info-querying wallet above Bitcoin-Qt then the threat model has to be wrong.
I think what this blog post is really about is that you and justin simply don't like Bitcoin Core. I'm disappointed but that's how it is. I've seen the stuff on twitter of what you say about segwit, Core, gmaxwell and everyone else, and how you've bought into all the r/btc conspiracy theories.
If you read your blog posts, 4 out of the 6 points can be summarized as "it's too early to say for LN". One point says how LN transactions are not on the blockchain but completely forgets about this being a privacy improvement. And the last point is "consumers might not care enough about privacy" (why this is specifically a problem for LN rather than bitcoin as a whole is never elaborated). See my point above about everyone being able to see 2011 Silk Road transactions for ever more, your blog post doesn't even mention this obvious point about off-chain transactions being more private.

Use a stronger passphrase I guess?
How many people who find your paper backup will also have access to a cluster for bruteforcing. For each passphrase candidate they need to calculate the PBKDF2 which is intentionally slow, and also do a few ECDSA operations to see if the bitcoin addresses have any bitcoins on them. It's likely to be a very very slow process.

Nope, EC's support was only from the hashrate, which is irrelevant in questions of a hard fork.

Inflation is when new money is printed that are indistinguishable from the existing money. That's not what happened here. Bitcoin and bcash are completely different and it's easy to reject one when accepting payments.

This changes nothing. Segwit can be bound up in another bip9 soft fork proposal and released again if required. Segwit could activate 10 years from now. Bitcoin can wait, the current miners who oppose segwit might die off one day, look at where the once mighty ghash.io are today.
But what the miners will *never* be able to hard fork bitcoin into something that the economy disagrees with.
And let's make one thing absolutely clear is that Segwit has the economy on it's side. We see from  that a hundred services and bitcoin projects are ready, willing, able and ever eager for segwit, including big names like localbitcoins, coinbase.com and BitGo. If miners activate segwit I can easily see them being rewarded by a price rally.

The network effect means you can't simply switch to an altcoin just like that.
Where will that user get his altcoins from? By switching coins he's lost the entire network of bitcoin ATMs and localbitcoins traders that bitcoin benefits from.
What I said is true; if altcoins take over, people need to switch all at once. That provides a huge disincentive which won't happen given that altcoins will run into the same tradeoffs.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:02:51
Constantly repeating this doesn't make it any more true.
UASF had [plenty of support]( including [one of the largest UK bitcoin exchanges](
S2X is mainly supported by [one investment group]( owned by Barry Silbert which owns companies that barely do any volume in bitcoin.
Also segwit was a soft fork and S2X will be a hard fork, so a much higher level of support is needed to make it successful. And S2X completely fails (resulting in merely a new altcoin) if there is significant opposition (which there is).

Being religious doesn't make you dumb. If you don't have any strong and unusual views you probably never left the beaten track. If you look around you, everyone in bitcoin probably believes slightly unusual stuff otherwise they wouldn't be here.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:18:49
I disagree with that, it takes a very big fall in hashrate to produce that situation.
If bitcoin loses a massive 75% of it's hashrate its block time only goes up to 40 minutes on average. If a portion of the economy really believes that this chain is the true bitcoin, they will tolerate those longer block times for a couple of weeks until the difficulty readjusts. So no the longer difficulty readjustments won't help much if the miners decide to attack bitcoin by attempting a hostile hard fork.
In fact if the economy is really with the original chain, it's token will be more valuable than thus miners might even jump back to that chain.
Now the question is, does Core and Segwit have the economy on it's side? We see from  that a hundred services and projects are ready, willing and eagar for segwit, including big names like localbitcoins, coinbase.com and BitGo. The economy is with Core, everyone wants Core coins and nobody wants BU coins. If the miners go against this they will mostly only harm themselves.

There's a limited amount of block space available, the best way we know of to ration scarce resources is to set up a market.
Miners have to eventually transition to being funded by miner fees instead of inflation. I don't think its a coincidence that all these backlogs started so soon after the halvening in July 2016 which dropped the bitcoin inflation rate down to 4%.
Finally, bitcoin requires full blocks to be stable after inflation drops. Otherwise there is no incentive for miners to step the chain forward instead of constantly orphaning the tip. Read this blog post: [Bitcoin is unstable without the block size limit](
It's time to realize that the bitcoin blockchain is not a payment network with a good user experience. That can be provided very well by layer-2 solutions like Lightning Network. The purpose of the blockchain is to provide low-trust currency, that's what makes bitcoin special.

Yes they do share blocks. If they receive a new block they will share it with all their other peers.
They don't share old historical blocks, which is what you're getting at.

Nope, the threat of UASF made the miners fall in line.
All the people saying "look how the NYA negotiation worked" have completely missed the point. You **never** go to the negotiating table with nothing. Make no mistake that the bitcoin community's readyness to go for a UASF was **crucial** in making the miners say they'll activate segwit.
To be clear, Bitmain had secretly funded Bitcoin Unlimited as an alternative miner signal which was blocking segwit. Shaolinfry invented UASF and it started getting a serious amount of support. Then the miners called a meeting in New York to "solve the crisis", which resulted in segwit being activated and a proposed hard fork that is easy to reject so long as people use full node wallets.

Segwit has does that. Although very few wallets have actually updated to support segwit (only Greenaddress and JoinMarket from what I see) so there's very few segwit transactions right now.

Luke isn't lying, he is absolutely correct.
A hard fork requires total consensus to be successful, if it doesn't have that then an altcoin is created.
Essentially everyone working on S2X is a liar and charlatan, all the actual legitimate people are ignoring politics and continuing to work on the genuine bitcoin.

Nice article, thanks for writing about your view. I totally agree with you a block size increase would be great.
About block weight voting, your own [linked reddit thread]( has top comments explaining why that idea can't work.
About this quote:


Have you heard of the tragedy of the commons? It's totally possible for individuals acting in their own self-interest to bring about the ruin of all. [We already know how this could happen in a bitcoin]( the problem with miners choosing the block size is the majority is making the decision of who gets to be a part of the majority.
Segwit is written, tested and deployed, and it has other attractive features. It's the only way to increase the block size right now, the other options just don't work. (Just one example as we saw yesterday was the bug in BU that forked itself off the bitcoin blockchain)
If the bitcoin economy wants this increase so badly, but the bitcoin miners are not delivering, then it's time to start thinking about the economy forking to a new PoW algorithm, effectively firing the miners. Because it's starting to look like they are not doing their jobs.

No, because bcash is an altcoin. The original bitcoin still exists and actually has the vast majority of users still using it.
Anyone is free to create an altcoin whenever they like. If they give all bitcoin holders tokens from their altcoin then you get something similar to what happened in the bcash situation. You can even claim your altcoin is "the real bitcoin" and complain on reddit to that effect, but the vast majority of users will disagree with you as can be seen from all available metrics (e.g. the price)
The chain split was a "success" if you want to call it that. But the bcash crowd did not succeed in changing the properties of bitcoin.

Hashpower is not economic majority: 
Remember when &gt;60% of all hashpower "signalled" support for Bitcoin Unlimited? How did that turn out.

He probably means that the merkle root of the segwit transactions must be committed into the coinbase transaction with OP_RETURN.
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:16:18
Thanks for the links. It's unfortunate to see so many sites with slightly misleading content.
The most important feature of a full node is that it's the only way to use bitcoin without trusting a third party to verify the rules of bitcoin. You don't have to open 8333 to achieve this. I've written about the trustlessness aspect here: 
Anyway thanks for posting the OP, I'm sure it will be useful to people from google.

Still kind of sad, segwit is a great update. But we can keep trying with the activation, it might activate in 5 years time.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:20:05
Sorry but that is rewriting history. BIP148 got support from several big players before Segwit2X was even created.
See this thread which got a massive number of upvotes and views: [BITTYLICIOUS EXCHANGE SUPPORTS BIP148 UASF!!!!! ](
I don't care whether or how the Segwit2x deal happened, what role Barry Silbert played, My node runs BIP148 and will have rejected any non-signalling blocks. The miners can deal with that how they know.
See my other comment here with the Japan/America analogy: 
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:23:52
That's what we did, the code was:
     if(date &gt; 1st august)
         activate segwit to raise the block size
And it worked! They call it user-activated-soft-fork. Segwit will be locked-in very soon!
@_date: 2018-10-25 21:19:41
You need a separate database because you need to store all the addresses that have been used before.
Right now full nodes only need to store all the block headers and all the unspent transaction outputs (which is already around 3gb)
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:58:56
I *certainly* hope Poloniex isn't doing any of what you just said.
If you want to do cold storage with Core you can use watch-only addresses.
@_date: 2016-11-13 10:37:22


He's probably talking about people who use full nodes. If not enough of the economy is backed by them then bitcoin dies.
@_date: 2016-11-14 17:41:40
For obtaining bitcoins, here is a link to a lot of places  You could also try googling "buy bitcoins &lt;your country&gt;". You'd probably want a method that allows you to buy online: so localbitcoins.com with online bank transfer, or bitbargain.co.uk if you're in the UK, bitcoin.de if you're in Germany.
Note that the only reason Coinbase/Circle are able to cancel your payment after the fact is that the transaction hasn't been broadcast to the real bitcoin network yet. One thing you could do to remedy this is to add your counterparty's bitcoin address as a watch-only address into wallet software like Electrum, which will then tell you when it hits the network and, [along with the caveats]( becomes irreversible
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:26:11
He's right though, this is an attempt to wrest control of bitcoin away from it's economic majority by making it harder to run full nodes.
What you interpret as "Core's resistance" is actually the resistance of the economic majority.

For newbs I'd recommend Electrum bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:32:45
Shouldn't be too hard depending where you live, check if you live near a bitcoin ATM, check on localbitcoins if anyone nearby would meet up to trade for cash (or put up your own ad if not), check if there's a bitcoin meetup group near you (often trades happen there.) Also on localbitcoins check the deals for sending you cash-in-mail in exchange for your bitcoins.

I bet they do. Otherwise their orphan rates will be pretty big and provide a big incentive for clustering together geographically, the only alternative is giving up on security with something like validationless mining.

Yes that's right, but still Electrum's seed probably can't be imported into some other wallet.

This is wrong. The chain being followed is the most-work valid chain.
Consider you could have the difficulty drop very low and then miner a longer chain with more blocks, but it would still have less total proof-of-work. Also obviously the chain has to follow the rules to be valid, otherwise the miners could pay themselves infinite bitcoins.
You should also discuss how larger blocks make it harder to validate, and how bitcoin requires full blocks in the zero-inflation future to work. It's not right to describe bitcoins in a payment channel as "locked up" when they are now free to move and transact instantly with very low fees.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:04:54
It's not about the number of nodes, but the economic activity done through those nodes.
Miners are constantly having to sell their bitcoin income in order to pay electricity bills and other costs. This makes them utterly dependent on the rest of the bitcoin economy. If miners created an invalid block, the full node wallets of economic users will reject them in the same way a careful goldsmith rejects fool's gold.
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:59:49

People have mentioned localbitcoins, you should be able to find a cash-by-mail seller on there. Then you could send cash in an envelope somewhere outside the country. Hide the cash so customs don't find it (e.g. send a book with the cash tucked in one of the pages)

Read this: 
In the extreme case (with blocksonly) you can run a node that uses not much more than 144MB per day.
You still need to download the blockchain to start off with, which may be problematic, but once that's done your node will hardly use any bandwidth at all and you get all the benefits of trustlessness, security and privacy from using it.

That's why segwit is so amazing, by allowing layer-2 technology it lets both sides win. Bitcoin can be decentralized *and* be cheap to transact.
As for who decides? The economic majority backed by full nodes. So the very people you're trying to kick off the network can decide. When you put it that way it's no wonder the hard forkers never made any progress.

The problem is called [proof-of-work]( The difficulty is readjusted to keep the average time between solutions 10 minutes.
Every one of these solutions results in a block, and each block in the early stages [creates brand new bitcoins]( This process continues until bitcoin reaches a money supply limit of 21 million units.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:51:27


No it's not. Larger blocks result in more resources needed to run a full node, if you don't have enough of the economy using full nodes then bitcoin dies.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:01:50
Try this: start sync'ing a node, look at your network usage and your CPU usage. After about block 150000 the blocks have enough transactions that CPU is always at 100% while bandwidth is sometimes very low (because it still hasn't verified the blocks it downloaded)

Looks like someone created a 'block' larger than 1MB.
 
 
The blockcypher website seems to be patched to display invalid blocks. No other blockchain explorer website has a record of that block hash.
 
The same thing is happening right now that would happen if any miner tried to mine more than 12.5 bitcoins. It would be rejected by the bitcoin economy, the full nodes of the exchanges, marketplaces and any OTC trader would reject these bitcoins in the same way that a careful goldsmith rejects fool's gold.
 
That proof-of-work was worth just over 13.2173 bitcoins or $12,000 at current prices. Which Roger just wasted, apparently believing his own 'Bitcoin Unlimited' propaganda. Since bitcoin.com is only a pool, the hash power was provided by many other people. Lots of little BU-supporting hashers who just got their time and money wasted by the pool's decisions.

It really doesn't help your case to just dismiss people's objections on this. There is no universe in which a hard fork to 2mb blocks was possible over a year ago.


*"None of my friends care about gold so let's make bitcoin into a copy of paypal but made with less efficient technology."* No, this idea must be rejected.

There's no such thing as the cloud, there's only somebody else's computer. That computer could steal your bitcoins if you upload your wallet file to it.

Oh I see what you mean. Yes, maybe.
Note that you can open bidirectional payment channels where only one side owns bitcoins. The other empty side just needs a keypair.

Depends what you mean by "meaningful increase". Segwit already doubles the block size (regretfully IMO but that's how it turned out)
In practice people today who transact a lot are likely to be using lightweight wallets not full nodes. Even some businesses are only using centralized payment processors or centralized APIs. This is not a good situation to be in.
People who want to transact should use a layer-2 protocol like LN. That has even better features than the blockchain could ever achieve, like instant payments.

Validation is done by all full nodes, not just miners.
Larger blocks cost more bandwidth to download/upload as you say, they also have more more transactions and more signatures that need to be verified.
These days hashing is quite centralized, people buy ASICs and connect them up to a pool without even running a full node themselves. It's not really a situation we want to make worse.

1) Miners go where the money is. They only follow, not lead.
2) If you don't want the community to be divided then stay with the status quo, like [the rest of the majority has](
3) Segwit was activated because of the BIP148 UASF. The NYA deal was just face-saving. 


So Antpool specifically said they wouldn't signal segwit unless Core coded a hard fork, yet the UASF movement gained steam and Antpool ended up signalling segwit. Open your eyes bro, the miners do not control bitcoin.

Looks like he's saying Satoshi's design of putting all transactions on the blockchain, to be relayed to every node and stored for evermore, can't work. (Then again, Satoshi never actually said "put all transactions on the blockchain", indeed Hal Finney wrote about bitcoin becoming a settlement layer in 2010 and Satoshi never disputed that)
The same design also has miners racing to publish their blocks, with miners above 33% hash power having an unfair advantage, which gets worse as blocks get bigger.
Luckily Satoshi coded in the necessary features to create payment channels, upon which lightning network is based on, which is tech that *would* allow bitcoin to scale to a very very high number of transactions. I think it's fair enough that Satoshi invented some clever things but didn't get the whole picture. Those who treat Satoshi as some god who got everything absolutely right first time are deluded.

You change the signature itself, while still keeping it valid.
All numbers in the cryptography are done in mod N, so if you have a signature made of values (r, s) you can set s &lt;- N - s, and it will still be a valid signature.
Another way is to add OP_NOP opcodes to the scriptSig.
Segwit completely fixed malleability by not including the signature in the calculation for transaction ID.

And don't forget the juicy juicy memes  and 
And lastly the UASF hats!
I'm sure the miners were nervously reading everything they could find, thinking whether they should risk a chain split or not. When Jihan Wu went to give talks only to find a good proportion of his audience was wearing those hats. A lot of the stuff happened somewhat behind the scenes, but there's no way the miners would have capitulated like this unless they were scared for their future revenue stream (which let's not forget, comes from bitcoin's users)
As for conspiracy, we already [know jeff garzik has ulterior motives for opposing segwit]( because of his coin-tracking startup. Most of that funding comes from state actors anyway so it's not too insane of an idea.

Hashrate is irrelevant for questions of a hard fork. Segwit is a soft fork so only needs a looser criterion to make it happen.
The fact that the BIP148 UASF was successful shows that the economic majority is truly in control of bitcoin. BU didn't happen, EC didn't happen and neither will 2x, because they don't have consensus from the economic majority. If they attempt the 2x hard fork they will only create an altcoin just like bcash.
This is not my opinion, this is how bitcoin works on a technical level. The pro-decentralization side seems to understand bitcoin software much better than the pro-scale side, which is a huge factor for why the former won and the latter lost.

Holding your own keys is much better than a personal safe.
You can encrypt the keys so they need a secret passphrase to open, you can [store them in your brain]( bitcoins have no physical size or weight so you can store any amount easily, they can be sent anywhere in the world through the internet without being blocked or seized. Bitcoins also have a fixed known money supply (they'll never be more than 21 million bitcoins) so you know your stored coins won't be debased or inflated away.

Bitcoin is P2P electronic cash that is valuable over legacy systems because of the monetary autonomy it brings to its users through decentralization. Bitcoin seeks to address the root problem with conventional currency: all the trust that's required to make it work
Not that justified trust is a bad thing, but trust makes systems brittle, opaque, and costly to operate. Trust failures result in systemic collapses, trust curation creates inequality and monopoly lock-in, and naturally arising trust choke-points can be abused to deny access to due process. Through the use of cryptographic proof and decentralized networks Bitcoin minimizes and replaces these trust costs.

It's unclear whether a lowered PoW would be that bad anyway, we're long past the point where other hardware could pose a threat to bitcoin.

Localbitcoins is a huge business in this space and its influence matters. I've heard anti-segwiters saying how they're worried that if the miners roll back the segwit update they could steal coins.

They are simply software that you can use to receive, hold and send bitcoin. As opposed to a third-party service which is like a bank that holds your bitcoins and can impose conditions on you. For your business you'd probably connect up your frontend to the bitcoin wallet software, when the user wants to deposit bitcoin you give them a new bitcoin address. When the bitcoin arrives at that address you credit the money to their account.
There's many ways to obtain bitcoin. [Here's a short list]( for which I'll add that you can also try googling "buy bitcoins &lt;your country&gt;" or check if you [live near a bitcoin ATM](

You talk about the small possibility of a confirmation taking one hour. But that has nothing to do with the fee paid, it comes from the randomness of the mining process. See these graphs
On-chain transactions can never be instantly confirmed, no matter what fee is paid or how large the block size is.

In lightning/payment channels, there's no entities holding the accounts. They work using the smart contracting features of bitcoin, not trust in third-party entities.

BitcoinXT wanted to [ban tor]( with a flawed method that was also a considerable privacy leak. The feature is not clearly described, is enabled by default, and has a switch name which intentionally downplays what it is doing (disableipprio)
BitcoinXT would have installed Mike Hearn as dictator of the code base.
BitcoinXT would have raised the block size to 8GB, that's gigabytes with a G. Along with the other stuff, that would have been the death of a decentralized bitcoin.
Like the other hard fork attempts, BitcoinXT tried to create a contentious hard fork that would have fractured bitcoin and vastly damaged it.
XT supporters were the first to engage in vicious personal attacks against the core developers.
Soon after XT was rejected, Mike Hearn gave up on bitcoin, a long interview by him appeared in the New York Times attacking bitcoin and now he works for the banks on private blockchains.
If someone still thinks BitcoinXT is remotely a good idea after knowing all these facts, there's absolutely no question that they are not a well-intentioned bitcoin user.

90/10 split is 100minute block times on average, and 20 weeks for a retarget in the worst case.
If some people really believe in the original bitcoin (and they'll be at least one: me) then they will stick with the chain and after a few weeks it will get back to normal block times then we'll be stuck with a fractured currency in two parts, just like Ethereum.
Have you read this?  Ultimately merchants and traders need to sell their bitcoins to holders, if holders don't want your miner hard fork chain they won't buy it.

Some of terminology has changed in the 8 years since that paper, which itself only provides a high-level view of bitcoin.
1. Hashing happens in mining hardware.
1. Developers are not able to change the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE parameter in bitcoin on their own, they can only write software and the economy can either adopt it or reject it. Any consensus change like this is called a hard fork, raising the 21 million limit would require a hard fork too, but hard forks require every single full node to upgrade for it to happen. They are very difficult to do and in my opinion will probably never happen.
1. Because that's the protocol. The block headers have a field called previous block hash which links to the last block, so together they make a chain. Full nodes have a rule that they follow the most-work valid chain, it can be shown that its overwhelmingly likely with time that then all full nodes will be following the same chain.

Bitcoin is not helped by lying to people about it's [features](
We're much better off by telling people that bitcoin provides a censorship-resistant, anonymous, unfreezable, irreversible, borderless, programmable, push-system medium of exchange. If that stuff interests them they can use bitcoin, if not use something better suited because otherwise they'll just be disappointed.
@_date: 2017-08-07 10:40:49
It's a hardfork if there's overwhelming consensus and therefore every single user adopts the new currency. Then we say the rules of bitcoin have changed.
If there's no consensus then the people who still believe in bitcoin keep using it and it continues to exist, the rules of bitcoin haven't been changed because bitcoin is still continuing.
Longest chain doesn't matter, the miner's opinion is not very relevant in these issues.

Bitcoin inflation is already just 4% per year. More than three out of every four bitcoins that will ever exist have already been mined. So it's not obvious that now is a bad time to start block space scarcity.
If block sizes became too big it would destroy bitcoin's decentralization and make it worthless. So no we can't just raise block sizes until each transaction has a tiny fee.

500 lines maybe, but it still would require a hard fork.
A hard fork would tear bitcoin apart into two currencies. Users wouldn't know if they have to pay with Bitcoin-A or Bitcoin-B, it would be destructive to bitcoin's network effect if this happened.
Despite all the warnings, Ethereum attempted to have a hard fork and it resulted in two ethereums: ETH and ETC. Look at the price of the two ethereums (down &gt;50%) and bitcoin (up 300% in the last 12 months), it should be pretty obvious how damaging the ethereum hard fork was.
Segwit has many other benefits apart from the single one you listed:  None of which would happen if a hard fork transaction format was changed.

I read r/btc a fair amount and their reasons are always some shady excuse. I'm pretty sure their real reason is that they hate Bitcoin Core and want to block it at every turn, they wanted to give control of bitcoin's codebase to clowns like Mike Hearn, Olivier Janssens or Justin Toomin who don't care about the very properties (decentralization) that give bitcoin it's value.

The pools that openly oppose segwit only number just under 10% right now. So it's certainly possible.
There's a lot of companies on [this list]( that are eagerly awaiting segwit. And my own JoinMarket project would be able to do really cool things with schnorr signatures that requires segwit. Coinjoin and schnorr go together very well.
One outcome is that segwit fails to activate in a few retarget periods which causes investors to get spooked and dump their bitcoins. Miners then get scared and decide to orphan all the non-segwit-supporting blocks.
If I was a trader I would be watching this carefully. The recent price rally since 27th October coincided with Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 being released and with a good proportion of listening nodes being upgraded to it.

Some analysis can be done. The marginal cost of a payment channel transaction is much lower than a blockchain transaction because it doesn't need to be mined or stored forever in scarce block space. So just from that they should be much cheaper.

Yes, its checked once every 2016 blocks at the same time as the difficulty retarget. The earlier kinds of soft fork would check at every single block.

I've never traded gift cards, but would the trades benefit from a middleman arbitrator like this?
Bitcoin has a feature called multisig. It's like having a vault that has three people have control over, the vault requires any two out of the three possible people to open it.
When doing a trade, the buyer and seller agree on an arbitrator that both of them trust (a moderator from your forum, for example). The three of them create a vault and the buyer deposits bitcoins into it. The seller can see that the bitcoins have arrived in the vault and then they hand over the gift cards. Once the buyer gets the gift cards, him and the seller together can unlock the vault and send the money to the seller.
If there's a disagreement, the arbitrator can look at the evidence from both sides and unlock the vault with either the buyer or the seller to send the money to them. Also, the arbitrator cant steal the money from the vault because it requires two people to unlock it. Finally, if the trade goes well the arbitrator doesn't need to get involved or even know that there was a trade happening.

Anybody calling for calm and pointing out that BitcoinXT had blacklists, would block tor, would raise block sizes to 8GB and would install Mike Hearn as a dictator, was mass-downvoted and hidden at the bottom of the thread.
The mods of r/bitcoin took the view that [Well-kept gardens die by pacifism]( They didn't believe that those with the most reddit clones and bots should control the conversation. So they started banning people, deleting posts and setting some threads to default-sort by controversial so that mass-downvoted posts wouldn't be made invisible. Big blockers saw this as censorship and created the r/btc sub where they could spread their ideas freely.

Payment channels can work without segwit. The main point of segwit is to increase on-chain capacity, yet your big blockers reject it only because it was invented by a Core developer.
LN is bitcoin (a) because Lightning transactions are bitcoin transactions and (b) because of the timeout clauses, it has the crucial property that you do not lose money if the counterparty reneges.

My first post on this thread is mostly about gmaxwell, for he spends most time on IRC helping people.
Maybe he'd be nicer to you if you treated him with respect and didn't attack his character? Just a thought.
It's very wrong and insulting to suggest that gmaxwell is a genocide-denying tyrannical murderer like Erdogan. Perhaps part of the reason these good feelings have arisen is because we see big blockers attacking core devs all the time and it offends us on a personal level.
I don't think there's anything wrong with appreciation of people who really deserve to be appreciated.

Cash means full and final settlement; in that sense, physical gold is cash, and a SWIFT wire transfer internationally is very cash-like. Those kinds of cash *are* expensive (gold in transport and verification, SWIFT in literal transaction cost), but to the extent people use them, it's precisely for their finality. So Bitcoin can be cash in that sense. Segwit doesn't change anything in this respect, it just moves some of the data around in the transaction.
r/btc wants something different, they want a low-cost internet payment network, something like paypal where finality doesn't happen and you must trust a third party. edit: on the blockchain, see below

In the block size conflict we saw people asking for bitcoin to pivot away from a low-trust digital cash into something that more suited their second-layer non-currency uses.
I think most people now echo the statement from the Bitcoin Core scaling roadmap:

and Bitcoin cannot and will not satisfy that demand for non-ecash
(non-Bitcoin) usage, and there is no shame in that.
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:49:37
Sorry but you're grasping at straws. There are reasons that don't stand up to scrutiny yet the big blockers keep repeating them. That's why I think their true motivations are they don't like anything the Core team proposes.
Segwit does not add technical debt, see this link that explains why not 
There are already more than two types. You've got p2sh vs non-p2sh, coinjoin, RBF, and all of them are handled fine.
The anyone-can-spend trick was always used in p2sh and it never caused any problems. It's just a red herring. A very similar trick is used in the OP_CLTV and OP_CSV soft forks, also with no problems and no reasonable possibility of problems.
The discount for witness data is because that data can be parsed and verified in a much more efficient way. The quadratic-vs-linear scaling signature verification issue is an example. The "centrally planned" point is neither here nor there, every engineering decision in bitcoin is centrally planned, even the 21m money supply limit was coded by a single entity.

This is a bad idea because you are generating randomness yourself. Humans are very bad at generating true randomness required for cryptography.

That would require that full nodes would cost far more in bandwidth and time in initial-blockchain-synchronization. It would make it harder to run a full node and would be the death of a decentralized bitcoin, which would destroy the digital-cash property.
It happens because all bitcoin blockchain transactions must be stored forever, all the gambling microtransactions from 2012 are still there on the blockchain. That's why Lightning is such a good technology because it stops this happening.

Don't use paper wallets, they have several serious problems.
If you want to store bitcoins on paper, a much better way is to have a wallet create a mnemonic recovery phrase and you write that down. You can also [encrypt them](

The way I see it is regular people would still be using both LN and the blockchain. And if you wanted to store bitcoins in something like a paper wallet you could just withdraw from the channel onto the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-06-18 00:31:00
If you only make one transaction every 5 years then LN is not appropriate. So if you want to store coins long term then simply close the payment channels and put the bitcoins in cold storage.
Other people in the thread are saying things like "with new tech it will be better". I don't think there's any shame in tradeoffs. One single technology doesn't have to be the best for every possible use case; Lightning is great for when you want to make many fast cheap transactions, other stuff is better when you want to put coins in cold storage.

I think the low transaction fee thing is oversold because the bid/ask spread for trading into and out of bitcoin has always been a good few % which more than wipes out any savings from paypal fees.

@_date: 2016-12-15 00:57:15
The correct terminology is *Why do my transactions confirm quicker when..*
Miners have finite space in their blocks. Paying fees in your transaction is taking part in an auction to get your transaction to consume that space. After all the bitcoins have been mined, miners will have to fund themselves using transaction fees only so that bitcoin can be inflation-free.
Miners do validate (because mining requires running a full node) but they only validate for themselves, no other bitcoin node is expected to trust them. And they don't get paid to validate.
You're welcome!

BTW, connecting to Electrum servers through tor isn't enough because the server can group together all the addresses belonging to your. Tor just stops it also knowing your IP.
The only way existing right now to synchronize to the blockchain without revealing your addresses is to run a full node that downloads the entire blockchain and scans it. Alternatively get a lightweight wallet and configure it to connect only to your own full node.
You know how they recommend to delete your cookies when browsing with tor? (tor browser bundle does it automatically) Well bitcoin addresses are like cookies you can't delete :(
@_date: 2016-11-23 12:36:45
If blocks are allowed to be full, miners could do an attack where they fill them up to make it harder for competing miners. Mining is a zero-sum game so they have a direct incentive to do this.
Pruning doesn't stop you having to download and verify the entire blockchain for the initial blockchain synchronization.

The prune setting enables you to delete old blocks from your hard disk without affecting the security or privacy of your wallet. See these release notes: 
Shapeshift is for converting bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies if you ever wanted to do that. One thing it's certainly not good at is privacy.

No problem, this stuff can be confusing. The incentives are subtle.
Miners are absolutely not paid to do validation for anyone else. In bitcoin everyone validates for themselves (unless they choose to trust someone else, which is another story). If miners were trusted to validate then they would have a perverse incentive to confiscate other people's coins or hyperinflate bitcoin.
Miners are paid to only choose the ordering and history of bitcoin transactions. They do this by creating blocks which bundle together many transactions, and are connected together to form the blockchain.

Of course it's hypothetical because we're still in the large subsidy era, but that will end one day. I don't know where you're getting the 50/50 figure from. A single large fee transaction can tip the scales into having miners fighting to mine it, orphaning each other and never extending the chain.

If the miners start doing that, the economy can do a PoW change. But that only works if nodes are easy to run.

Some miners mine on top of one block, other miners mine on top of the other block. Eventually one side will become longer which breaks the tie.
That's one reason bitcoin transactions require confirmations to be irreversible, so we can be sure that the entire network has come to consensus about which transactions actually happened.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:15:37
No it's not, it's a very simple relationship. Miners set the history of valid transactions. Users and investors actually give value to those transactions.

Limitless blocks would be the death of a decentralized bitcoin.
Full nodes must already download all blocks since 2009 when they sync to the network. At 1MB per 10 minutes thats 52GB per year added on. With a limitless blocksize it would take a massive amount of time for new nodes to sync and would lead to a drop in people using full nodes.
@_date: 2016-11-10 11:09:20
Breadwallet has terrible privacy problems, you're essentially telling any node on the network your bank balance when you use it, and it's linked with your IP address. This is true for any wallet that uses bip37 bloom filters.
Researchers have set up spying nodes and have found a few people who used such wallets to store thousands of bitcoins each, it's weird and wrong that they're seemingly not aware of the privacy issues.
To get over your fear of paper wallets not working, I'd recommend trying the whole process with small amounts.

This is the core scaling roadmap: 
The summary is, bitcoin is valuable because of the low levels of trust it requires. There's also a tradeoff between scale and decentralization. Core will work on a variety of scaling technology (libsecp256k1, headers-first sync, bip9, segwit, weak blocks, schnorr) to make everything more efficient so more transactions can happen without affecting decentralization. Also they will help work on technologies that sidestep through the scale/decentralization tradeoff (transaction cut-through, lightning network).
@_date: 2018-06-10 00:51:29
One-tx-per-block-with-coinjoin will probably happen after schnorr signature aggregation is added to bitcoin.
I don't think fixed denominations will help, as it damages the divisibility of the currency. It also requires much more block space, if you want to send 1.85 btc you need to send 1 + 0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1 + 0.01+0.01+0.01+0.01+0.01 btc. So that uses **14x** more block space.

Ethereum's centralization is directly caused it's plan to support lots of transactions. All of them have to be verified and stored, and this costs many resources. Users are routinely advised to switch off verification in their nodes to keep resource usage down, that's one reason it was so easy for the developers to force a hard fork.

Try to close as many application as you can, then configure -dbcache to be a large of a number as you can. -dbcache=4000 would be a cache of 4GB in RAM for example. That will speed it up massively because less CPU time is spent reading to and from the hard disk.

Bitcoin blockchain transactions were never instant, they were only temporarily free (and there was always the cost of volatility and a bid/ask spread when trading)
If you raised the block size, the spammer would just run their while loop a little longer before filling up blocks. The way to stop spam is to make it costly for the spammer, not give them more territory to pollute.

The split in the community happened because of the economic and philosophical issues I explained above, and the attacks from the big blocker side who just won't give up their dreams of a hard fork to massive decentralization-killing block sizes.
I remember when Mike Hearn's misleading blog posts were mass-upvoted here along with memes and simplistic lies like *"big blocks will make bitcoin go to the moooooon!"*. Hearn said he wanted to make himself dictator of the bitcoin code base, totally contrary to decentralization.
The big blocker side used [automated vote manipulation]( [brigading]( and [sockpuppets](
Their personal attacks also nearly succeeded in driving away top core developers like [gmaxwell]( and [laanwj (wladimir)](

If everyone trusted miners to validate transactions, those miners could one day confiscate other people's coins or create infinite bitcoins.
Full nodes by definition check all the consensus rules of bitcoin, such as:
* Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for miners, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
* Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
* Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
* Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
It's required by bitcoin's security model that most of the economy uses a wallet backed by a full node, otherwise the miners have an incentive to break the rules.

You're right, the bitcoin blockchain has a finite size, and it must stay that way for bitcoin to stay decentralized.

Breadwallet is on mobile.
Mycelium connects to the central mycelium server, which itself runs a full node that connects to the network. Electrum wallet also only connects indirectly.
But it's not very important what connected directly or indirectly. The most important thing when choosing a node is whether it fully-verifies the rules of bitcoin without trusting anybody else. See:

I guess you're right. A completely centralized bitcoin running off a few datacenters would still have some value.
People could still use it for remittances, some online purchases and maybe trading. They'd have to identify their real name before they use it, fees will be cheap like paypal, and it will be hard forked to remove the money supply limit, but it will still have some users maybe even a lot of them. Roger Ver's investment will be gone though, permanently inflationary currencies are not amazing investments like the original bitcoin is.

Big blockers want to stop segwit for political reasons (They don't like that the Core developer team came up with it)
@_date: 2016-11-11 10:46:20
When the rbitcoin team deletes their altcoin pumping, it's censorship. But it's somehow not censorship when rbtc users downvote our posts to collapse them hidden at the bottom of the thread, invoking rate-limiting on that account.
I remember in summer 2015 I would argue in support of Core here and all my posts would be mass-downvoted and hidden at the bottom of each thread. The mods here set some threads to default sort by 'controversial' to stop downvoted posts being hidden, and boy did the rbtc crowd get pissed off about that. With one simple trick theymos stopped their downvote censorship.
We know they [engaged in automated vote manipulation]( we know [they used sockpuppets]( we know [they used vote brigading]( For such apparent lovers of liberty and freedom, they really like censoring other's freedom of expression.

You have to accept there's a tradeoff between scale and decentralization. Make the blocks too big and people will stop using the bitcoin because it will stop being decentralized.

MimbleWimble is not a second layer solution. Any blockchain that has Confidential Transactions can use it, but it doesn't change the O(number of TXOs) behaviour.
I haven't look in the last few months but last time I was there I saw people saying lies about gmaxwell and talking about how monero won't have a big blocker / UASF situation because it has a dynamic block size limit. Which completely misses the point about the tradeoff between scale and decentralization, that tradeoff isn't fixed with a dynamic block size limit, it just damages decentralization.
With current technology bitcoin full nodes need to store O(number of UTXOs) and Monero full nodes need to store O(number of TXOs) which grows much faster. It's not noticed now because Monero isn't used very much, but as time goes on it will become a problem.

No they're not. Not all kinds of capitalism are anarcho-capitalism, that that state controls some infrastructure doesn't make the entire economy socialist.
It's not just Americans who don't like socialism and marxism. We Eastern Europeans suffered for 50 years under the boot of Soviet Russia. We were invaded, occupied, decades of wasted potential with our economy ruined by economically-illiterate socialists, without democratic elections, without freedom of speech or any other liberal values. After emerging from the cold war, we found ourselves dozens of years behind the west. Only lately are some of those problems being fixed.

Also lightweight wallets that connect to the p2p network couldn't sync either.

Full nodes listen for the blocks that miners produce, that's how they know what transactions happened.
Once a transaction is a few blocks deep then it becomes effectively irreversible, that's why receivers of bitcoin wait for some confirmations before handing over some good or service.
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:29:44
Yes they generally charge on a per-kilobyte basis.
But one payment channel transaction on the blockchain can represent millions of lightning transactions, so even though the transaction will be larger it will be much more efficient than without.

A massive feature too.

@_date: 2017-08-10 15:33:33
Yep, it also depends how far along the fork happens in the retarget period.
Either way, bitcoin has existed for 8 years already, a period of slower blocks won't be fatal. Not to mention those miners have to really waste money by all leaving bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-09 08:58:00
You have to trust the other person who verified/indexed it first. Sure your node will verify any new blocks but historical blocks will not be verified, so for example the person who gave you the data dir could print infinite money without you detecting.
I appreciate the risk isn't that big so you're probably fine though.

I'm surprised the pro-Core side isn't angrier. The big blockers tried to destroy bitcoin by allowing it to be centralized into a small number of data centers.

In their OpenBitcoinPrivacyProject this author compared different bitcoin wallets for privacy. They put Samurai Wallet above Bitcoin-Qt.
Samurai queries blockchain.info's web API and therefore reveals all the user's addresses. Bitcoin-Qt downloads the entire blockchain and parses it locally, therefore not revealing anything to any third-party server. It's ridiculous to put Samurai above Bitcoin-Qt.


It can't make it any worse than the status quo where all transactions are visible to everyone for the rest of time. You can go back to 2011 and see people sending coins to and from Silk Road, that record will never disappear but be visible to all forever.
Of course it's good to bring up these concerns, though the ones in this blog post seem a bit shallow like "well LN has never been deployed in production", "The specifications are still in draft form" which isn't the same thing as saying it won't be private.

In any centralized system, if there's a mistake or fraud the central institution will always be besieged by requests from customers for chargebacks. The centralized institutions cannot avoid being the judge, jury and executioner. If the centralized instution So transactions can't be final. Ultimately if the institutions doesn't do this, customers can go one step higher to the judicial system.
In a decentralized system like bitcoin the base layer has no customer service to complain to in case of fraud. So transactions are final, and fraud is prevented by the routine use of escrow and 2-of-3 multisig arbitration.
This also means centralized institutions have to bother their users for identifying information, and merchants must be wary of customers too, also bothering them for ID to make it harder to do chargeback fraud. So a centralized system also can't be anonymous.

The decimals problem you talk about is easy to fix, just use smaller denominations. That would be 325 bits minus 25 bits.

If 75% of hash power left, then block times go up to 40 minutes instead of 10 minutes. In the worst case this lasts for 8 weeks instead of 2 weeks, then there's a difficulty readjustment and we're back to normal.

The bitcoin community on reddit has had something of a schism related to the value of a constant in the source code called MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.
It comes down to two different visions of what bitcoin should be. One side wants bitcoin to be something like a digital cash which focuses on the decentralized currency aspect. The other side wants the bitcoin blockchain to be a high-volume payment method a bit like the Visa card network with much less emphasis on the decentralized currency aspect.
The bitcoin-as-digital-cash view is strong in r/bitcoin, the bitcoin-as-payment-network is strong in r/btc
The bitcoin-as-digital-cash side supports the [Core Scaling Roadmap]( while the bitcoin-as-payment-network support switches between Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited. The bitcoin-as-digital-cash side is sometimes called the pro-Core side, and bitcoin-as-payment-network are sometimes called the big blockers.
Bitcoin-as-digital-cash says the blockchain should be a very secure decentralized base layer with which payment networks can be built on top of. Bitcoin-as-payment-network says the blockchain should contain all transactions including people's daily coffee.
The Core scaling roadmap contains segwit as a proposed update to improve bitcoin's scalability. The big blocker camp opposes it.
Disclaimer: I'm pro-bitcoin-as-digital-cash.
Also, in this post I've separated the situation neatly into two camps, but some people don't put themselves in either but hold views from both sides (e.g. approving of a hard fork to much larger block sizes, but also in segwit)

Monero cannot delete spent coins, so it can't prune the blockchain like bitcoin does. If Monero ever got into a big blocker / UASF situation they would probably lose because full nodes get much harder to run than for bitcoin.

Whoever is advertising bitcoin this way is wrong.
Right now bitcoin uses inefficient technology (the blockchain) that cannot compete with centralized payment providers like credit cards. Bitcoin is valuable because it is low-trust money, not because it's cheap.
There are plans for better payment technology for the future, known as Lightning Network, which is much more efficient and so would have far lower fees. Although even then fees won't be zero.

One possible way to do it would be to add features to JoinMarket to make use of schnorr signature aggregation.
People who want to send bitcoins with a low miner fee and don't mind waiting a little bit would have a joinmarket bot advertise that they're willing to create a coinjoin with schnorr. Then when someone comes along who wants to create a coinjoin immediately they talk to everybody else who was waiting. Together they make a massive coinjoin which only has a single schnorr signature, and each individual transactor pays a much smaller miner fee than if they didn't do it this way.

So I haven't spent much time thinking about that, but I'll say/link what I read from others:
Sidechain are L2 and MW can be a sidechain so MW is L2, I suppose that is true. I understood sidechains as being more about doing cool experiments without having to create an altcoin, not doing much for scalability because they are still blockchains. I'm thinking wouldn't it make sense to just recode Monero to use MW, they do regular hard forks so that is possible.

A single person can fill up 8MB blocks with a while loop. Then miner fees would go up in response and big blockers would be complaining again. Note that [bitcoin always needs full blocks to be stable]( so whichever limit you choose will be the block size in the long term.
I don't know exactly how many nodes would go offline. But the 1MB limit has worked until now, if it isn't broken don't fix it I say, and it's worrying how many people [don't understand how fragile bitcoin is]( You'd give away some decentralization to get a small amount of added capacity, it's pointless.

Yes indeed. In Core's plan, small daily transactions would be served by smart contract linked payment channels, also known as lightning network.
If you think about it, even today the blockchain is not a great digital cash because a confirmation takes on average 10 minutes. So it's not very useful for in-real-life transactions because people have to wait around. Lightning network can provide instant irreversible transactions that would be excellent for IRL commerce, which is another reason we're so excited by it.
FWIW, in lightning network it would still be possible to prove that a certain payment took place.

You are correct, excuse me. Let's hope that the segwit block size increase activates as soon as possible.




Bitcoin's security model requires most of the economy to be backed by fully-verifying nodes. Otherwise the miners have an incentive to print infinite bitcoins, steal other people's bitcoins or double-spend a coin.
Read this explaination for more details: 
So to be clear, it's not about seeding (nodes can choose to not seed) or storing the blockchain (nodes can enable pruning to delete old blocks) but about verifying. And if not enough people do it then bitcoin becomes worthless.
Fine, don't read anything I link, only read material from your own side.


Miners don't have the power to stop it, the required soft forks were bip65 and bip112 which reached consensus ages ago.

Thing is, if bitcoin loses it's decentralization then all those other nice features are gone too.
A centralized bitcoin will be required to bother you for your identify, it will be possible to freeze your account and an infinite number of bitcoins could be created.
I remember when paypal first started out and there was also some excitement about a digital cash. But because it was centralized it slowly became neutered.

You don't send money to public keys, you send them to addresses (which can be calculated from public keys)
So you'd send money to that multisig address. If you created an address from any of those public keys you could send it to that too, but it would have nothing to do with the multisig address.
This is one of the earliest tutorials on multisig:  And it's still pretty good.
You can also use this javascript page to use multisig  Finally the Electrum and Armory bitcoin wallets also implement it.
I'd highly recommend playing with this stuff on testnet first before doing it with real bitcoins. If you need testnet bitcoins you can ask for them on any forum or get them from a testnet faucet.

The first one was never true, the second one is a re-definition of "free".


Do you deny that such a spammer could exist? I'm not talking about whether the fee event last week was a caused by a spammer or a genuine burst of transactions.


Sorry but you were lied to. Around 2013 a lot of people were lying about the properties of bitcoin to get newbs to invest. And anyway trading into bitcoin also had a bid/ask spread which would have been too high for people in absolute poverty. Same for bitcoin's price volatility.
Even when on-chain transctions were free, no person in absolute poverty used bitcoin because if the price dropped one day they couldn't eat.
Bitcoin *can* help the third world, and is helping the third world today, but not in the ways you think. Once LN matures then bitcoin can provide very-cheap transactions too.

Removing the limit would kill bitcoin's decentralization. The cost of larger blocks on full nodes wouldn't be taken into account by miners, so they'd just create huge blocks and not care about forcing full nodes off the network.
If you can come up with a cost-function for the loss of decentralization, go for it and make a market.

Just want to deal with the idea of "letting the market decide" which you mentioned several times.
Tearing up bitcoin into more than one fork violates the immutability and the property of sticking to the key monetary features. So that's a major reason why not to "leave it to the market" via a hard fork. It would violate the properties of durability, acceptability, limited supply, fungiblity and uniformity.
Luckily, it's possible to find the market's opinion on the exchange rate without creating a hard fork. Back in August 2015 TierNolan came up with an idea to create a futures contract on the exchange rate between core-coins and XT-coins. Here's the thread: 
I thought it was a great idea and in that thread I actually offered to engage in an OTC deal. I would trade my bitcoin-XT-coins for their bitcoin-core-coins in the event that a hard fork actually happened. Nobody actually took me up on the deal, but if you want to "let the market decide" you could try resurrecting the idea and trying to find counterparties for it on an OTC basis.
The futures market on hard-fork-coins would allow people to put their money where their mouth is.

Multisig is just a smart contract, it has many possible setups not just one.
Exchanges are using BitGo to create a separation of powers, so a hacker has to break the exchange and BitGo at the same time. GreenAddress does the same thing to make a wallet.
You can do this yourself using Electrum's or Armory's multisig for security, relying on the idea that malware is unlikely to infect your laptop, desktop, smartphone and paper backup at the same time.
Multisig used in openbazaar is not for security against hackers, it's for escrow.

I don't know. I came up with the idea while discussing on IRC thinking about coinswap which has the same problems.
Essentially the most dangerous form of malleability of LN comes from the s value in the signature, since if s is a valid signature then N - s is too. It's dangerous because it can stop the refund transaction working. To get around it you demand the payer sign a refund transaction with s and another one with N - s, then if it gets malleated you can just use either transaction to get your refund.

The summary is that a surprisingly small rise in block size will screw up the decentralization. Even the current size is too large according to some.

No that is not accurate at all.
Lightning does not have counterparty risk. The bitcoins loaded inside the payment channels are yours, the security is very strong such that they cannot be taken from you. It is based on cryptography, same as old-style bitcoin transactions. This is unlike a prepaid card system where Visa could just steal your money one day.
Lightning is a network. Payments can go through multiple hops, so if Alice has a payment channel with Bob, and Bob has a payment channel with Charlie, then Alice can pay Charlie over Lightning trustlessly by routing the payment over Bob.
This means that if you have three or four payment channels open you can transact with anyone on the entire lightning network. So it's not like a prepaid card system where you can spend only with special vendors.

LN doesn't require segwit. The miners have no power over whether LN happens or not.

@_date: 2016-11-27 13:11:44
There's also the initial blockchain synchronization. At 1MB per block the blockchain grows by 52GB per year. All that has to be downloaded and verified by every new bitcoin node.
SSDs have been getting faster and cheaper, but the biggest win from that point of view has actually been blockchain pruning. Since SSDs getting better still requires someone to buy a new SSD, blockchain pruning doesn't require anything.

The hashrate is already far higher than any non-miner could command. The biggest threat to bitcoin from hashpower is the existing miners themselves, raising or lowering the price doesn't directly affect that.

It sounds like you're missing the point that payments can be routed across many channels.
So if you have one or two payment channels open, you can send money to *anybody in the entire lightning network.*
Or in your analogy: it's not one gift card per store, but one gift card for the entire economy. (At this point it just becomes money rather than a gift card)
As for actually managing the channels, that will be mostly done automatically by wallets especially because you can make a on-chain payment and open a payment channel at the same time. [The talk here by Tadge Dryja explains this idea](

The secp256k1 protocol uses a point on the curve called the generator point G.
Public key Q is another point on the curve, q is a private key.
Q = qG
Except it's over a finite field so it's all mod N (N is another parameter of the protocol, it's a big prime number)
Q = qG mod N
In bitcoin, the most common kind of address is a hash of the public key Q, so to spend the money you must reveal Q itself as well as a valid signature (r, s)
What do you mean by calculating Q "every time", if you mean calculating it when the bitcoin wallet software is started up or when the wallet is first created, then no it's not too slow for that.
But a big bottleneck is when a new bitcoin full node synchronizes to the network, it must verify all signatures since the beginning of time which can take a long time.

The blockchain is one of the least efficient data structures ever. Every transaction must be flooded to every node in the network, and miners must spend a relatively large amount of electricity. This means that it can become more efficient to centralize if certain limits like the block size limit are not in place.
It would lead to normal users switching off their full nodes and miners centralizing into one datacenter. If bitcoin becomes centralized then a government authority can come along just like they did with paypal and impose regulations, demanding the real-life identity of every user, bitcoin wouldn't be allowed to be sent to certain countries that don't follow the same rules, your transactions and balance could be frozen or reversed by a third party etc. Essentially you'd end up having all the downsides of paypal.

Relax, bitcoin's exchange rate more than tripled since that sub was created near the start of the block size conflict.
Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 got a higher proportion of listening nodes on the network in the first few days than any alt-client has ever achieved. The rise of 0.13.1 was matched by a drop in other nodes, which shows it was people actually updating rather than spinning up nodes on AWS like Classic once tried.
Segwit got more miner signalling in a week than XT / Classic / Unlimited have managed in an entire year of campaigning.

Why should people from the third world be excluded from trustlessness? Indeed in contemporary history some of their major problems come from the flawed trust model of currency (see Venezuela and Zimbabwe)

Once LN matures everyone including third worlders can access very-very-low cost bitcoin transactions. But that won't work unless the base layer is decentralized.

Because of all the other features of bitcoin. Low-trust money with all the consequences that flow from that.
Nobody smart is going around saying bitcoin is great solely because it has no chargebacks. Unfortunately that's a myth that seems to have caught on.


No you don't. Dark net markets use escrow and multisig escrow even though everybody is anonymous.
If you look at the popular bitcoin services you'll see they all include escrow (localbitcoins, purse.io, all the bitcoin auction sites, all the DNMs, bitbargain, bitcoin.de etc) Consumer protection is a solved problem in bitcoin.
All bitcoin transactions involve fees (miner fees and the bid/ask spread of trading into and out of bitcoin), adding escrow doesn't change that a huge amount.

The early blocks were small with not many transactions, as bitcoin became more popular, so the later blocks became much more full with more transactions. So they take more time to verify.
Increase your `-dbcache=M` parameter in bitcoin.conf. M is the number of megabytes of RAM to allocate to the database cache, having a larger number makes it sync faster.

It benefits you, and you are part of the network. Making yourself more secure makes the network as a whole more secure.
If the miner were ever to attack Bitcoin (by confiscating coins or inflating the currency) they know they will not succeed if most of the bitcoin economy is backed by full nodes, because the miners won't be able to sell any bitcoins from their new blocks as most of the economy won't recognize them as real bitcoins.
If most of the economy is only backed by lightweight wallets then miners can attack the network by printing infinite bitcoins. Bitcoin's long term survival depends on most economic agents using full node wallets.
Longer explaination here: 
The reason people are much less concerned about upload capacity is that it's easy to add it by renting lots of hardware like VPSes or AWS. Decentralized full node wallets are much harder to add and are more important so we rely on education to inform people to why it's so crucial. Having said all that, my node also uploads now since there's no reason not to do it if you're able to.

The bitcoin community on reddit has had something of a schism related to the value of a constant in the source code called MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.
It comes down to two different visions of what bitcoin should be. One side wants bitcoin to be something like a digital cash which focuses on the decentralized low-trust currency aspect. The other side wants the bitcoin blockchain to be a high-volume payment method a bit like the Visa card network or paypal with much less emphasis on the decentralized currency aspect.
The bitcoin-as-digital-cash view is strong in r/bitcoin, the bitcoin-as-payment-network is strong in r/btc
The bitcoin-as-digital-cash side supports the [Core Scaling Roadmap]( while the bitcoin-as-payment-network support switches between Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited. The bitcoin-as-digital-cash side is sometimes called the pro-Core side, and bitcoin-as-payment-network are sometimes called the big blockers.
Bitcoin-as-digital-cash says the blockchain should be a very secure decentralized base layer with which layer-2 payment networks can be built on top of. Bitcoin-as-payment-network says the blockchain should contain all transactions including people's daily coffee.

In the case of the bitcoin node connecting to the internet only over Tor, then the existing EPS will never reveal your IP addresses because the transaction will only be broadcast over Tor connections. So yes in that case this feature isn't that useful.
That has the downside that when synchronizing you need to download the entire blockchain over tor, which would be very slow. Downloading the blocks over Tor doesn't improve privacy because every full node will download all the blocks anyway. However it would help in a situation where you don't want your ISP or VPN provider to even know that you're using bitcoin (but they'd still know you were using tor).
The attractive thing about broadcasting over Tor but downloading over clearnet is that you can use the fast clearnet connections without costing too much privacy, and still have privacy when you broadcast.

It's to do with trust.
You wouldn't accept cash banknotes or gold coins as payment without checking that they were actually real. You'd check the security features; holograms, magnetic strip, the density of the metal, etc. Doing all these checks with a full node is the equivalent thing but for bitcoin.
If you don't use a full node then you might be slipped some fake bitcoins. Such attacks have been threatened to happen in the past so this is not just a paranoid threat. Of course for small amounts and a low number of transactions you can get away with using a lower-security wallet, but for serious bitcoin commerce you need a full node.

It makes transactions that don't need to be mined into blocks, but with clever smart contracts they can still have all the security and decentralization properties of the bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin can be sent over the internet and can be made anonymous. So if someone scams you it's generally impossible to go after them.

It is not true to say that that satoshis are traceable. They don't have a watermark or any other identifying marker. Watch [this video]( which explains it.
As a concrete example, look at [this transaction]( The question is where did the first input which is worth 39.69800397 BTC end up? Did it end up in the 3rd, 4th or 6th input? There is no answer because nobody can tell, because all those outputs have the same value. So much for satoshis being perfectly traceable.
So it's not true to say that all transactions are perfectly traceable, the situation is much more complicated than that.
But at the same time, privacy issues do have the potential to damage bitcoin so we should take care of it.

I'm going to copypaste my comment from [the other thread on r/bitcoinCA]( No the OP blog post *has not* proven anything. (I still think its an exit scam but not because of blockchain analysis, which hasn't shown anything much in this case)
Interesting work. As someone who's spent years creating bitcoin privacy software I've got a few thoughts on this:
The MtGox point is just not right. That wallet cluster has not much to do with MtGox, instead it's a big cluster containing many coinjoins (coinjoins completely break the algorithm used by walletexplorer)
For example the following address actually belongs to the JoinMarket project which can be verified by looking at the project github page, yet walletexplorer thinks it belongs to that [same MtGox cluster](
Blockchain analysis is hard, and it's easy to trick yourself that you are sure of something when you're not. As you've just seen with the MtGox point. Blockchain analysts need to not be overconfident. Also, Bitfury's paper on wallet clustering isn't worth much, thats their business which they make money from so obviously they're going to say everything is all wonderful and completely ignore things like coinjoin that break their algorithms. There's a lot of bullshit in the blockchain analysis space unfortunately, including this walletexplorer site which gives you seemly-true conclusions without mentioning any of the caveats.
You believe you found part of the hot wallet (which I find convincing) and then talk about how there have been withdrawals even after Cotten's death. But obviously there can be withdrawals from a hot wallet; the private keys are probably on a server somewhere accessible by the other employees. The QuadrigaCX's claim is that they can't access their cold wallets, not their hot wallets.
One thing about walletexplorer's algorithm is it only works when addresses get spent *from*, and works best when addresses are reused and when lots of spends are happening, such as in a hot wallet. So if the exchange was mostly ever sending *to* its cold storage wallet, not reusing addresses and only very rarely spending *from* then that would make it difficult to find using walletexplorer. You may never find a "significant pool of bitcoins" because it wouldn't exist due to the limitations of walletexplorer.com. I'm not suggesting this is definitely what happened, but it's a possibility. I personally find it hard to believe an exchange didn't use cold storage, they're clearly aware of the concept. It's possible and likely that if the cold wallet exists it wont appear as one cluster on walletexplorer.
As for multisig, an address starting with 3 does not imply multisig it only implies p2sh (for example it may be a single-sig segwit address). But you can easily check whether an address is multisig if it's been spent from. The input signature will contain the full multisig script if multisig has been used.
IMO this is an exit scam, but your work here hasn't proved it either way.
Quick suggestion: you could try looking for big transfers into the hot wallet that come from multisig addresses. That could reveal the cold wallet (assuming it really does use multisig). But multisig is also used by ordinary people so its not a perfect piece of evidence. What would help is if you could show that the multisig addresses only ever received money from the exchange hot wallet, and then sent the coins back to the exchange hot wallet.
Proving that such transactions don't exist would also be evidence that the cold wallet doesn't exist. But as always, it's very hard to prove a negative.
EDIT: another thing, people usually use round numbers when transferring to and from cold wallets (just because of psychology, as they're transferring to themselves). So expect to see transfers that have values like 4000 btc or 200 btc, but probably not something like 235.56326483 btc. So that's one thing to look for.
EDIT2: the round number might be in another currency, so for example 235.56326483 btc might be almost exactly one million USD or CAD.

Centralized mixers are rubbish. You can get the same service by depositing and then withdrawing coins from any bitcoin website with a hot wallet, for example a casino. You still could lose your coins but at least you don't pay the silly fees.
CoinJoin is even better in the sense that its non-custodial; your private keys never leave your own computer. As well as wasabi wallet, another coinjoin solution is JoinMarket which has liquidity up to about 200 btc. Although admittedly its a little harder to install than wasabi.

More likely is that this forking will be how government interference takes effect.
Imagine this situation: There is another financial crisis like 2007 and most investment banks are about to fail. Governments of the world want to bail them out, trouble is they cant because everyone uses bitcoin and they don't have enough of them to pay off the bank's debts.
So... they attempt to create a hardfork. They release a new version of Bitcoin Core where everything is the same but the code controlling new bitcoin creation is modified to create new currency units used to bail out banks. Maybe this call this alternative client BitcoinBT or something.
They'll write stories about the world ending. Financial armageddon, businesses not being able to access credit markets, ATM machines closing down and worldwide contagion if bitcoin isn't patched to bail out banks. They'll program the client to wait until 75% of miners agreed to this inflation (as if miners had any control over it)
You think this is insane and would never happen? [Some are already arguing for the 21m cap to be lifted](
Bitcoin today luckily has rules to stop this. But hold onto your full nodes, don't go hardforking for any old reason.
Note: I'm not suggesting BitcoinXT is like bailing out the banks, but that both are hard forks. If the contentious BitcoinXT hardfork succeeds then it doesn't look good for Bitcoin's supposed resistance to inflation.

brando2123 is more correct, the system keeps track of UTXOs (which are referenced as transaction ID + output index in transactions). If you have an address its generally very slow to find which UTXO(s) live on it, but if you have a TXID and index its generally very fast to find the value of that UTXO and which address/pubkey is needed to spend it. So UTXOs are associated with an address but the transaction format doesn't talk about addresses it talks about TXID + index.

Full nodes wallets are also currently the most private way to use Bitcoin, with nobody else learning which bitcoin addresses belong to you. All other lightweight wallets leak information about which addresses are yours because they must query third-party servers
Running a full node as your wallet is the only way to know for sure that none of bitcoin's rules have been broken. Rules like no coins were spent not belonging to the owner, that no coins were spent twice, that no inflation happens outside of the schedule and that all the rules needed to make the system work are followed (e.g. Difficulty.) All other kinds of wallet involve trusting a third party server. If bitcoin is digital gold, then a full node wallet is your own personal goldsmith who checks for you that received payments are genuine. You wouldn't accept a cash banknote or gold coin without checking it is genuine, the same applies for bitcoin.

The phrase 'third party' usually implies certains powers. A third-party bank can freeze your account, confescate your money, censor your transactions and reverse them. With bitcoin that is not possible for an individual miner or anyone (unless a single miner gets 51%)
That's probably what means when he said his private key gives him exclusive control over his bitcoins.

The number of inputs (coins being spent) and outputs (addresses being paid to). So for example every time you receive a payment that is one more coin in your wallet, when you spend those coins they become a transaction input. Transaction outputs depend on how many people you pay at once.

Not trivially.
The easiest safest (still not easy or safe) way is to open an account on a bitcoin exchange that allows trading on margin, such as Bitfinex. Then deposit some USD with them as collateral and use it to open a short sell position of 2 bitcoins. When you get paid then buy back in to close your short sell. If the bitcoin price has gone down, the profits from your short sell will exactly cancel it out, and vis versa if it's gone up. And make sure you have enough collateral to not get margin called.
But yes I agree it would be nice if this process was made easier. Apparently there are some wall street types working on it but its still early days.

You have some seriously misunderstandings over how bitcoin works on a fundamental level.
Nodes on the bitcoin network will always reject invalid blocks, no matter how much mining proof of work backs them. Miners can choose to mine on some other blockchain, but that would be an altcoin and they may or may not be able to sell the coins they mine for fiat currency needed to pay their bills.
Miners as a group have NO power over issues like the 21 million money supply. The ONLY thing miners have control over is the history of transactions.

You can, but the paper wallet site doesn't warn users about address reuse, so its likely they won't know do that. The entire design of the paper wallet implies that addresses can be used more than once, so bye bye privacy. Seed phrases by contrast don't require any of that, just generate them once and you have all the addresses you need.


Many many many people have lost money because of this. If you hang out on forums a bit and help with support you'll see. There's no reason for users to understand the unintuative behavour of private keys, they should just be clicking buttons clearly marked *send*, *receive* and so on.


Not "apparently", it is a privacy issue and a serious one at that. Also it's a validation risk, the user is forced to trust some third-party server who could lie to them about the definition of bitcoin, and trick them into accepting bcash or something else.


There's no reason for users to understand the unintuative behavour of the UXTO model and change address, especially because if they get it wrong they lose their money. Users should just be clicking buttons clearly marked *send*, *receive* and so on.

It's always easy to say in hindsight that something was stupid. Fact is that nobody else realized for years until this hacker did. Adversarial thinking and security is quite hard.

A bitcoin address is where bitcoins live. You can send bitcoins to an address how you send emails to an email address. 
1. Full node means (amongst other things) that it had a copy of the entire blockchain on its hard drive. So when your wallet wants to find out what coins are on your addresses, it just has to check the blockchain on its hard drive. An SPV client (Simplified Payment Verification) usually means it will ask a third party what coins are on your addresses, that means the third party will learn which addresses belong to you.

No, theymos is correct here. Full nodes will always reject invalid blocks. Miners do not have control over issues like the block size.
Think of this way, if &gt;75% of miners decided to create more coins than 21 million (because they want to increase their own income maybe), would they be able to? The answer is no, full nodes would always reject their blocks and the inflationary miners would not be able to sell their new altcoin.

@_date: 2015-08-24 21:06:26
My view is that it's because of differing views on what bitcoin is and should be.
Core supporters are more likely to value the decentralization above all else. They like bitcoin's properties of censorship-resistance, privacy, no central banker, etc. They are usually the earlier adopters who are motivated by some kind of libertarian or crypto-anarchist ideology
XT supporters are more likely to see the bitcoin blockchain as a payment network. They are interested in transacting money with low fees across the world or using the blockchain to store records of asset transfers and proof-of-existance. You can see another change that BitcoinXT does unrelated to block size is that it attempts to make zero-confirm transactions safer. This group is more likely to be VC investors or late(r) adopters.
Of course there's an overlap between the two groups and actually the sides agree on quite a lot. But you can see on some stuff they cannot get along. If blocks get bigger then on-chain transactions will be cheaper and there's more space for storing data on the blockchain. But if blocks get bigger that could significantly reduce the decentralization of the system. An important point often missed is one bitcoin on-chain transaction can represent hundreds of thousands of actual economic transactions. This is the principle behind other scaling proposals like Lightning Network.
Another problem issue is nobody really knows what "too large" or "too small" means for blocks.
Disclaimer: I have my own views which might colour my analysis. It would be best if an XT supporter also replied with their own summary of the situation.

@_date: 2015-08-10 10:00:58


Sure, the difficulty will eventually readjust and we'll be back to normal. I don't entirely see the problem, the same thing happens when a lot of miners suddenly come online or offline.
I for one won't want to hold XT altcoins which have rules that are likely to lead to all the mining power being on one shelf in a datacenter somewhere. That's not what I got into bitcoin for. Luckily my full node will always reject invalid blocks no matter how much proof of work they have behind them.
The problem is that currencies get their value from the network effect. The value of a network goes as the square of the size. If you split the bitcoin network in two the value will go down by a factor of four. So this XT altcoin business has the potential to destroy a lot of value.

That's not how a valid chain is defined in bitcoin. Each full node checks whether the chain is valid for itself, it's an important way for bitcoin to not require much trust in others.
To be clear, valid means that people can only spend coins belonging to them, they cant spend more than they have, they cant spend a coin twice, miners cant inflate the currency faster than scheduled, etc. Lots of really important stuff.

True, but the BitcoinXT-attempted-coup hardfork is.


Sure, but there could end up a tragedy-of-the-commons type situations where neither side wants to back down even though both would benefit if they agreed. It's essentially like a war.


Well, the world can go on without bitcoin.
Since bitcoin (and any currency) gets it value from the network effect, it stands to lose an awful lot by being partitioned.
Competition is normal and healthy but co-operation is too. Currency is about co-operation, it is how humans organise our economic activities.


Sure, but if the number of users you can trade with suddenly drops significant, you'll find your bitcoins are suddenly far less useful. (By a quadratic factor to be precise, because of Metcalfe's law)

A hard fork means there would be two blockchains which share a history at the point before the hard fork happened.
Coins from before the hard fork you could spend on both chains. As you use your wallet for transactions your coins will eventually only exist on one chain.
The wallet you use will determine which blockchain you're on. If you use a full node wallet like Bitcoin Core or Armory then you can directly control which blockchain you accept and which you reject. If you run Electrum or another lightweight client, you accept the blockchain that the Electrum server accepts.
If there was a hard fork it's likely there would appear some exchange where you could trade between the two blockchains. So if you supported one chain you could buy those coins and sell the other chain.

Look at it this way, if the majority of miners decided to inflate bitcoin above the 21M limit (to increase their profits as creators of new currency units) would you be able to stop it? The answer is yes you could, your node would reject invalid blocks that created more coins than scheduled.
It's fundamental to how bitcoin works that miners dont actually have much control in these kind of things. Miners are *not* just a new kind of central bank.

This is why centralizing mining and giving them more power is a bad idea.
@_date: 2015-08-25 00:39:25
It's possible that miners are actually running [NotBitcoinXT]( so the 75% hash power in the block headers might be a lie.
The skewed difficult is not fatal to the Core fork. That problem has been discussed years ago in bitcoin, e.g. [Can a massive drop in hashpower make bitcoin slip into a downward spiral?](
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:00:38
Saying something is theoretical isn't the same as saying it isn't anything to worry about.
BIP66 was a soft fork, completely irrelevant here because raising the blocksize is a hard fork.
The issue is slightly confused because BitcoinXT waits for 75% of *mining power* before it accepts &gt;1mb blocks but miners dont have any power over the blocksize.
A currency's value comes from its network effect. So if you were to split bitcoin's users (not miners, not pools, but actual economic entities) in half it would reduce the value by a factor of four. Look at why all those other altcoins are near-worthless despite being often carbon copies of bitcoin software.
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:51:07
Yep, Electrum can be run through Tor.
You should be aware that Tor is not necessarily enough to get privacy with bitcoin. All bitcoin transactions are recorded forever on a public ledger which anyone can see. It's like how Tor won't give you privacy is you browse the web with cookies enabled, well bitcoin requires something like cookies to work.
So for example, if you buy your bitcoins from a place like Coinbase.com which requires you to send in your identifying information, they could look on the blockchain what you do with your coins. You could run your coins though a bitcoin mixer to confuse coinbase.com, alternatively you could buy your coins with cash or another method where you don't give up your ID. It all depends on your threat model, if you're running from the NSA you have to take more precautions than if you're just using bitcoin to play online poker.

I don't think Moore's law was given as the reason. A point often missed is that the network releases new bitcoins regardless of how much mining power is pointed at it.
More like that bitcoin mimics gold in some ways. The 4 year periods are like new gold mines being discovered and depleted. Presumably it's there to give many people over the period of years a chance to acquire some bitcoins by mining.
But yes, when the mining subsidy halves in 2016 that will reduce the supply of new bitcoins.

Yes spending all the money on address 2 will result in a more expensive transaction, all else being equal. Because the transaction from address 2 will have 5 inputs but the transaction from address 1 will have only 2 inputs. Each input costs a certain amount of bytes to spend so spending 2 inputs is cheaper than spending 5.
Note that address reuse doesn't change this calculation. If all the transactions on address 2 were actually sent to 5 different addresses then it wouldn't change the total bytes required to spend them. So address reuse doesn't reduce the miner fees you pay, it only damages privacy.

@_date: 2016-11-15 20:30:14


There's a couple of reasons:
1. Right now mining is funded by the creation of new bitcoins (i.e. inflation). That doesn't last forever in bitcoin. Once the inflation rate drops too low the plan is that miners will be funded by transaction fees. Without a block size limit the marginal cost of adding another transaction to a block goes to zero, so miners wouldn't be able to fund themselves.
2. In the future with no inflation, miners have no incentive to extend the blockchain as opposed to orphaning the top block, unless there is a block size limit. See this article 
3. Larger block sizes make bitcoin more vunerable to selfish mining.
4. Full nodes (remember, that means they verify all the rules of bitcoin) need to be widely distributed and be backing most of the bitcoin economy, otherwise miners have an incentive to create infinite bitcoins or steal other people's bitcoins.

To add to this: localbitcoins clearly got squeezed by governments to remove the cash trading option because cash is too private and too hard to track. The only reason that squeezing was possible is because localbitcoins is centralized. Ethereum is centralized too so we can expect governments to do the same thing if it ever gets too popular (right now basically nobody uses Ethereum as money)

Your coins are safe, they would exist on both blockchains. But if you went to spend them they would in general exist on only one chain. So eventually you'll have to choose a side.
Much of the value of a currency comes from its network effect. The value of a network goes as the square of the number of users. Meaning if with a hardfork you split the bitcoin network exactly in half, the value would go down by a factor of *four*.
This is why many of us are warning a controversial hard fork is dangerous.

Well we've been encouraging miners to use the bitcoin relay network for months now and some still stubbornly don't update, even though they could easily make an extra 5% profit with it.
Along with stuff like SPV mining responsible for the 4th July accidental fork, I'm ready to believe a sizable amount of miners will do incredibly stupid things.

Many core developers actually don't care too much about the block size 1mb limit. e.g. Luke-jr, Pieter Wuille, Wladimir J. van der Laan. Pieter Wuille has actually written his own proposal which is linked from the OP.
So yes, clearly a compromise position could possibly get consensus. There is a scalability workshop  where people will be meeting.
The really alarming thing is this hostile hardfork attempt. BitcoinXT tries to make a hard fork without very strong support amongst bitcoin's users. Many people don't like the idea of bitcoin having its rules changed just because of some charismatic leaders wrote blog posts and lobbied a couple of mining pools. Many people including myself fear that if this tactic works for the block size, it will work for other rules like the 21 million limit. Every bitcoin holder should be concerned about this.
This is no longer just a discussion, it's a war between two sides. A tragedy-of-the-commons type situation where neither side wants to back down even though both would benefit if they agreed. Remember that a currency's value comes from its network effect. So if you were to split bitcoin's users (not miners, not pools, but actual economic entities) in half it would reduce the value by a factor of four. Look at why all those altcoins are near-worthless despite being often carbon copies of bitcoin software.

The best way to invest in bitcoin is probably just to hold bitcoin. An alternate way is to VC fund bitcoin startups.
Both are risky because bitcoin is quite new and success is not guaranteed. And bitcoin could succeed without startups like coinbase.com succeeding. If you have money to invest and have a stomach for the volatility, it's worth thinking about just in case the whole idea catches on.
If you decide I would recommend practicing storing and recovering btc with small amounts before anything larger. The trouble with being totally in control is if you mess it up there's no support number to call. Bitcoin is digital cash, send it through the wash or lose it in a fire and it's gone. Also don't daytrade, gamble or invest in bitcoin stocks.

It sounds like you want to use them for daily spending as well. A wallet like GreenAddress has 2FA I hear, which is very good. I've never used it myself.
For coins larger in value than what you'd carry around with you in cash, you should probably keep in offline storage. For example in a paper wallet (easiest and simplest) or an offline computer that never touches the internet (slightly more involved, but has benefits)

1. Much of the time a coinjoin deal doesn't result in the orderbook being updated. Plus the work trying to survey and chart completed coinjoins on the blockchain actually shows a lot of transactions that seem to be coinjoins just by chance. If miners could censor then any cryptocurrency is dead anyway. Censorship is stopped because mining is a market with very low barriers to entry, and some anonymous entity could mine over tor and collect the transaction fees.
2. Sure, this problem is outside the scope of coinjoin. You can see that the bitstamp hacked coins were reintroduced into the ecosystem quite quickly and they didn't even use coinjoin. It doesn't seem like a problem currently. If you do happen to get so-called tainted coins (which is a problematic concept anyway) then you can use coinjoin to break the link.
3. It is the intended aim of JoinMarket that this happens. Then coin redlisting or blacklisting will rapidly become unworkable, if it's not already. Remember that plenty of transactions out there look like coinjoins just by chance.

With a new person I wait for one confirmation, works for the amounts I trade.
Usually it goes like this:

* Buyer shows the seller the cash, possibly counting it in front of the seller
* Seller sends coins to buyer's address
* Buyer gives cash
Always meet in a public place.

Monero will inflate the money supply forever. You will have to pay for holding that coin by inflation. At least bitcoin's inflation will end one day and you know you're getting 1/21m by holding one. If you want to talk about paying you've picked a bad alt for that.

Well, some are [already arguing]( for the 21m cap to be lifted.
I don't think it's too hard to imagine. Consider this situation: There is another financial crisis like 2007 and most investment banks are about to fail. Governments of the world want to bail them out, trouble is they can't because everyone uses bitcoin and they don't have enough of them to pay off the bank's debts.
So... they attempt to create a hardfork. They release a new version of Bitcoin Core where everything is the same but the code controlling new bitcoin creation is modified to create new currency units used to bail out banks. Maybe this call this alternative client BitcoinBT or something.
They'll write stories about the world ending. Presidents go on TV. Tearful appeals. Financial armageddon, businesses not being able to access credit markets, ATM machines closing down and worldwide contagion will happen if bitcoin isn't patched to bail out banks. They'll program the client to wait until 75% of miners agreed to this inflation (as if miners had any control over something like this)
Bitcoin today luckily has rules to stop this. But hold onto your full nodes, don't go hardforking for any old reason.
I don't believe that people will always follow the right proposals, if I did then I'd just use a central bank currency ruled by a liberal democracy.
Note: I'm not suggesting BitcoinXT is like bailing out the banks, but that both are hard forks. If the tactic works for block size it will also work for inflation. Bitcoin should only ever work by consensus, not war.

1. How can miners be obliged to do anything if there are &gt;100 political jurisdictions worldwide and a miner could mine over tor if required? Sybils attacks is a studied topic you're bringing up right now. There are discussions on it for JoinMarket and I invite you to go read them.
2. What I meant to say is JoinMarket doesn't stop you from receiving transcations because that's inherently impossible in bitcoin. Anyone can find a random address used on the blockchain and send coins to it.
3. AML checks are done with paperwork. They already work with physical cash which does not have a blockchain or transaction history. JoinMarket does not necessarily stop AML from working, that is a different issue from fungibility. You're assuming a lot about what *taint* means and if that's even a good metric. Since bitcoin transactions are many-to-many mappings its not clear that taint tracking can even work.

Not for long. Soon enough the difficulty will adjust and Bitcoin Core will be back to 10 minutes average block times.
Those 20% of miners on the Bitcoin Core fork now get 100% of the rewards. All miners eventually have to find a buyer so they can pay their electricity costs. The economic majority, not miners, ultimately chooses which fork will win.
It comes down to which fork holders of bitcoin will choose. I believe they'll choose the original Bitcoin Core, which doesn't have new pressures to centralized mining and which doesn't set a precedent that bitcoin can be subject to a hostile hardfork which puts other rules like the 21million limit in danger.

You'd imagine walking through a building familar to you, maybe your own home or workplace or school.

In the next room you see your brother naked in **shame** attempting to cover himself, he's looking at a window thats **open** and flapping in the wind. And so on.

Lightning nodes could *temporarily* lock up your bitcoins by being non-cooperative. Then the other side would have to wait for the timeout to get their bitcoins back using the unilateral channel close transaction.
I don't want to say there's no way that governments or banks could use LN to block transactions, but I've been thinking about it since I read about how LN worked and I can't come up with a way.
LN nodes can be run on tor, there's nothing in LN's protocol that requires any permission to open a channel. As a very last resort you could always just make an on-chain transaction, so any movement by LN nodes to block transactions can always be bypassed.

JoinMarket as a project to improve bitcoin privacy.
The idea behind JoinMarket is that holders of bitcoin will allow their coins to be mixed with in return for a fee. The mixing happens in coinjoin transactions.
Because of the fee paid, coinjoin mixing in JoinMarket will become like an almost-riskless stock for owners of bitcoins that pays dividends. Their private keys will never leave their computers and they will not sign transactions not to their liking.
As the risk is very low, the reward will also be low because of competition between fee-earners. It means that you will be able to do a coinjoin very cheaply. Right now the orderbook shows you can do coinjoins for a 0.0002% cut.

Satoshi's vision of SPV does not exist today, it relied on fraud proofs. The phrase SPV today refers to must-lower-security wallets mostly based on BitcoinJ that completely trust the miners. There's been discussions on IRC about trying to change the word SPV into something like VFV (verification-free verification). I've taken to calling them "lightweight wallets" instead of "SPV wallets" but even that isn't perfect because a full node could in theory be made very lightweight indeed. Maybe "lower-verification wallets" ? Where "lower" is a euphemism for "none".

I know what you're talking about because I've heard the same misinformation/misunderstandings being spread before. It's not about economic incentives but cryptography.
Rules like "coins can only be spent by the private key holder" and "coins only created following the inflation schedule" are enforced by full nodes verifying the rules. Any blockchain that breaks those rules is *simply not bitcoin*.
Some people say that if miners printed more than 21 million then the price of bitcoin would drop, yes that is true but miners could still make a lot of money doing this. Luckily that's not how bitcoin works. So yes, bitcoin is not a "everyone trusts the miners" system, and miners are not just another kind of central bank.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:13:38
It is very much in the individual bitcoin's users rational self interest to run a full node and use it as their wallet.
Running a full node as your wallet is the only way to know for sure that none of bitcoin's rules have been broken. Rules like no coins were spent not belonging to the owner, that no coins were spent twice, that no inflation happens outside of the schedule and that all the rules needed to make the system work are followed (e.g. Difficulty.) All other kinds of wallet involve trusting a third party server.
If bitcoin is digital gold, then using a full node is like checking that you truly have real gold instead of fool's gold. You wouldn't accept a cash banknote without checking it is genuine, the same applies for bitcoin.
All these checks done by full nodes also increase the security. There are many attacks possible against lightweight wallets that do not affect full node wallets.
This is not just mindless paranoia, there have been real world examples where full node users were unaffected by turmoil in the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem. The 4th July 2015 accidental chain fork effected many kinds of wallets. Here is the wiki page on this event July_2015_chain_forks
Notice how node software updated months ago was completely unaffected by the fork. All other wallets required either extra confirmations or checking that the third-party institution was running the correct version. A bitcoin business, like an exchange, marketplace or online store should always use a full node for security.
Full nodes wallets are also currently the most private way to use Bitcoin, with nobody else learning which bitcoin addresses belong to you. All other lightweight wallets leak information about which addresses are yours because they must query third-party servers. The Electrum servers will know which addresses belong to you and can link them together. Despite bloom filtering, lightweight wallets based on BitcoinJ do not provide much privacy against nodes who connected directly to the wallet or wiretappers.[1]
For some use cases, such privacy may not be required. But an important reason to run a full node and use it as a wallet is to get the full privacy benefits.

Datacenter-level operations would be the death of a decentralized bitcoin.
It's not just censorship resistance against relaying that nodes protect against, but also the enforcing of bitcoins consensus rules like the 21m limit and no-double-spending. To enforce these rules, people must be able to run full nodes easily.

If people use bitcoin core for their consensus layer then they don't need to test anything else. SegWit had an in-person code review where developers from around the world flew to spend days to review and check everything.
See:  and 
I'm also wondering why this high standard wasn't applied to other soft forks like P2SH, OP_CLTV and so on.
Many other coins have actual value and still don't get attacked for a long time. If you remember the Shadowcash altcoin which existed for years until it was found to have a critical bug that completely destroyed it.
On the other hand, if people really want to wait long for segwit then I guess that's okay. I don't make many transactions on-chain so I'm not hurt personally by high miner fees. But I always understood that raising the block size was urgent for some people.

If you use tor, the service like bc.i behind tor will be able to link all your bitcoin addresses together. Tor will only stop them learning your IP address too.
The *only* way right now to privately learn about which bitcoins are on your addresses right now is to download the entire blockchain (you can prune it after so no need to store all those GB)

In my experience, not at all. Once you've configured it how you like, you can simply run the executable and it works.
The main issue I find (which is more annoying than technically difficult) is that if you run your full node after it has been switched off for some time, it will have to download and verify all the blocks that happened since then. It means you have to wait a while before you can use it. It can be remedied by never switching it off.
@_date: 2016-02-11 22:58:12
Unfortunately that scales as O( N^2 ). It's impossible to have everybody's coffee purchases on the blockchain and retain bitcoin's decentralized and censorship-resistant properties. Bitcoin transactions are SWIFT, not VISA.
Luckily one blockchain transaction can represent countless numbers of real economic transactions. In this far off future where bitcoin is used by many orders of magnitude more people, the hash-locked bidirectional payment channels (aka LN) could provide enough capacity. Plus they would bring other benefits like instant confirmations and improved privacy.
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:54:28
There is, you asks the exchanges/marketplaces/casinos/etc what their position is. Also you could trade a synthetic product like UASF futures, for example this has already shown that the BTU coin has no support (currently trading at a 90% discount compared to real bitcoins)
I'm not sure what losses economic nodes will take. At worst their customers will be a bit confused and confirmations will happen a bit slower. Miners on the other hand will lose $14k per invalid block they mine.

@_date: 2016-02-08 19:33:07
Yes you're right. More nodes with open ports out there make it harder for an [eclipse attack]( to work on a node. This essentially means the attacker isolating the bitcoin node from the rest of the network and feeding it blocks with fraudulent transactions that later get rolled back. For it to happen, the attacker must control lots of IP addresses, a portion of the hash power and be able to DDOS the node or wait a long time. So it's only possible for governments, large security firms and maybe botnet owners.
It's a good security practice to connect your full node to other people's full nodes who are known to you. For example connect to your friends, colleagues, trading partners, etc with the -addnode and -connect configuration in bitcoin core. I'd probably do this if I ran a large bitcoin business.

There could be a chainsplit but a much less damaging one than results from a hard fork attempt.
The chainsplit would be more similar to the accidental split following the bip66 soft fork which healed itself pretty quickly, with the only damage being to the miners who were stupid enough to break the rules.
@_date: 2016-02-08 19:06:35
That's right. Miners must run full nodes too, otherwise they won't be able to produce blocks that are accepted by the real economy.
@_date: 2016-02-01 17:16:41
Fundamentally there is nothing stopping people doing that. The store could try to mitigate it by checking whether the transaction has enough fees to confirm quickly, or they could not allow the customer to leave until their transaction gets enough confirmations.
The way bitcoin works is that transactions recorded in the blockchain are not reversible, and the more blocks they have built on top of them the greater their irreversibility. Unconfirmed transactions could be changed or replaced for any number of reasons.
You might say bitcoin is not that great for in-person purchases like this. In the future it's likely that people would use something called hash-locked bidirectional payment channels which would be able to have instant irreversible cheap payments.

As long as the coins are treated the same for economic purposes it's perfectly fine. Cash banknotes are also nonidentical but they work. If you want to get technical, only subatomic particles are identical and everything else could in principle be made non-fungible.


As long as 51% of miners are not colluding, they are not able to censor transactions. Even if the coinjoins-look-similar argument doesn't convince you, there are other privacy protocols like coinswap which look exactly like multisig transactions and therefore would be indistinguishable from a sizable part of bitcoin's transcations.


Why would it only improve it and not solve it?
Perhaps in the long term, a privacy sidechain can be made which has all possible privacy tech built into the protocol. Then people would be able to use all of bitcoin's liquidity and capitalization along with privacy features.

A 2MB hard fork wouldn't ruin bitcoin straight away. You must remember that the same people pushing for 2MB only a few weeks ago for pushing for hard fork schemes that raised the limit to 20MB, and continually rising eventually ending at 8GB(!)
If you ask the average hard-fork advocate what they would do if 2MB blocks became full, they would likely answer that they'd simply raise the block size again. After all, they've raised it before and everything turned out okay, right? It would eventually be the death of a decentralized bitcoin, full nodes would have a very hard time starting up, huge blocks would make miners centralize into being physically close to each other, after the reward halves a few more times the miners would be unable to fund themselves. Bitcoin would become just another centralized payment network, no better than paypal (and probably much worse)

I agree it wouldn't be great if there were very few archival nodes but I wouldn't want anyone deciding not to run a node because they can't afford the bandwidth or storage space.

This is true. At least until fraud proofs are implemented.
I would argue the main reason to run a node is the trustlessness, security and privacy benefits. The altruistic helping of the network is a mere side effect in my view.
Lightweight wallets **completely** trust the miners. The miners could create an infinite number of coins, steal other people's coins, double spend coins or any other dishonest behavour, and the lightweight wallets would happily accept it. The low amount of full node usage by some parts of the economy today is part of the reason I wrote this thread.

Electrum Personal Server is an implementation of the Electrum wallet server protocol that allows users to point their Electrum wallet at their own full node. It allows the user to benefit from all of Bitcoin Core's resource-saving features like pruning, blocksonly and disabled txindex. All of Electrum's feature-richness like hardware wallet integration, multisignature wallets, offline signing, seed phrases and so on can still be used, but connected only to the user's own full node.
Full release notes:
* Releases will now also be packaged as windows binaries using pyinstaller.
* Added option to allow broadcasting unconfirmed transactions via any
  system call, for example it could be a shell script which broadcasts
  via SMS or radio.
* Added option which allows disabling the mempool histogram feature
  which is useful on low-powered devices when the mempool is large.
* Deprecated electrum-personal-server-rescan script in favour of

Extension blocks are basically a merge-mined altcoin to those who disagree with it.
Segwit moves the witnesses/signatures outside the original block, the actual bitcoins are still in the block and can be seen by every old node and SPV wallet.
Extension blocks don't do this, they "move" the bitcoin transactions outside the blocks too. Old nodes and SPV wallets who disagree with the update don't see the flow of bitcoins anymore.

If you're using bitcoin-qt without anything else then you must be careful with backups because it does not yet use a deterministic wallet. (Help test this PR to remedy that 
When using another wallet that is just backed by a full node, for example Armory, Multibit, JoinMarket or Electrum, all of them have a deterministic wallet that can be easily backed up by writing down a mnemonic recovery seed.


Not really. Decide if you want to use pruning. Decide how you'll control bandwidth usage (the simplest way is to just use -listen=0 and not upload anything). Decide how much RAM can be used to store the UTXO set. The whole thing probably works out of the box but configuration can make it run more efficiently.

That is easy to unmix with taint analysis. It's the one situation where taint analysis actually works.

Double-spending unconfirmed transactions is pretty trivial even today with no RBF. See

There's a great update called segwit which is being added to bitcoin as a soft fork. This update also breaks a patented attack on the mining algorithm called asicboost, which was unknown when segwit was coded.

In theory there is no counsel that decides these things, Bitcoin aims to be decentralized so nobody is head. Things like this are decided by the aggregate of everybody who is willing to trade goods and services for bitcoin. (This is known as the economic majority)
It comes down to a difference in what they believe Bitcoin should be. People on the anti-hard-fork side often believe Bitcoin should aim to be a decentralized, censorship-resistant digital gold. People on the pro-hard-fork side like Coinbase.com generally believe that bitcoin should be a payment network like VISA or paypal, and the currency status is not that important.

You seem to be missing a key idea here. This is exactly the point.
The troubled BIP66 rollout further supports the case for UASF. The few non-enforcing miners quickly got back in line with BIP66 because the economic majority supported it.
I'm reminded of that time after the first halvening when some miners patched their nodes to keep mining 50btc forever. Well they stopped doing that pretty quickly! Miners who break the rules of bitcoin will have their blocks rejected in the same way a careful goldsmith rejects fool's gold.

walletnotify is a bit more klunky to use, the only benefit is you get the notification 'instantly' but bitcoin moves so slowly (10 minute average block interval) that instantly doesn't matter much.
I've written some open source projects that require every user to setup their walletnotify and it would've been easier if everything just went through json-rpc.


walletnotify can give you an unconfirmed TXID but then later it could give you a different confirmed TXID because the unconfirmed transaction was malleated.

The forces that determine the 1MB block size are the same thing that determine the 21m money supply limit.
If someone held a gun to Core developer's heads and forced them to create &gt;1MB software would that work? Of course not! Bitcoin is bigger than Core's github account.
The anti-Core side is complaining about bitcoin being immutable, well tough, that's one of the properties of good money.

I think it does. For a competative market you'd want fixed costs much lower than marginal costs. For a concrete example, what was more  decentralized, GPU mining or ASIC mining? The answer is ASIC mining is more centralized because to start up you need a nanofabrication plant to create these custom chips. While GPUs are mass produced and so the capital requirement is lower.
It's worth noting that *pruned full nodes* first appeared with the wallet disabled, the only possible use of them was mining. I'm sure if you read the developer mailing list or github around then probably you'd see that their motivation was to help miners.

Bitcoin Classic is an alternative client which follows different consensus rules to the regular bitcoin. After the so-called hard fork, Classic nodes would follow one side of the fork and the traditional Bitcoin Core would follow the other side. It would essentially become two different currencies that each have their own exchange rate.
There is a political controversy in bitcoinland these past few months where one sides wants a hard fork to increase the block size, and the other side wants to [increase capacity using other improvements]( I personally support the Bitcoin Core no-hard-fork side and I see Coinbase.com's support for a hard fork as a bad thing.

No, because Chainalytic's spying works on most lightweight wallets too, on SPV wallets like Multibit they could do the same spying. It's very likely that they also run Electrum servers of their own.

Electrum wallets ask for a mempool histogram from Electrum servers, the histogram contains information about how many unconfirmed transactions are in certain ranges of fee rates.

Yes they does serve lightweight wallets, you are right.
But right now there is really no shortage of bandwidth capacity, and if there was it could be easily added by renting cloud servers. It's not a problem at all today.
The lightweight wallet security model is really bad. The miners could create an infinite number of coins, steal other people's coins, double spend coins or any other dishonest behavour, and the lightweight wallets would happily accept it. They reason they even exist is because it's much easier to code something to be insecure. Consequently it's much easier to serve them, even a single person could pay for the costs of spinning up a few dozen more nodes with open ports if need be.

Differentiating between certain types of coins is not necessarily bad for fungibility.
If fungibility becomes degraded, it would first show up that large bitcoin institutions will reject your coins with the message *"Your money is no good here. Those coins were used for illegal or immoral uses 3 transactions ago"*. When this happens the owner of those coins is going to google the problem. He'll notice that *if he uses some privacy tech (e.g. JoinMarket), he can thwart the analysis of the coins*. So I think the fungibility problem solves itself once you have easy access to privacy. Any attempt to enforce non-fungibility of bitcoin will push people to seek out privacy solutions.

I understand a suggestion for the long-term is that nodes can configure how much disk space they want to contribute to the network. Then they store only some blocks and upload them.

One reason is there needs to be an economic rent on top of the orphan cost otherwise there won't be much of an incentive to secure the network after the block reward goes to zero.
Another reason is miners can reduce their orphan costs by moving physically close to each other then they can create blocks as large as they want. It would be the death of a decentralized bitcoin if that were to happen.

Yes that's right, however miners have far less power over the user's money than any financial institution like paypal or a bank. You are still actually reducing trust, not just moving it around.

It's worth mentioning that lightweight wallets **completely** trust the miners. The miners could create an infinite number of coins, steal other people's coins, double spend coins or any other dishonest behavour, and the lightweight wallets would happily accept it.

If what you say is true, bitcoin will be dead.
I don't know if you've ever talked about bitcoin to new people. One of the first questions is *"How can this 21m limit thing be real? What's to stop miners just creating more bitcoin?"*. The answer is that the economy backed by full nodes wont go along with it. If what you say is true, and miners really can force the economy to hard fork, then non of bitcoin's rules are secure including the 21m limit.
In reality what will happen is the 75% of miners will see the price of their hard-fork-coin has dropped so much that they switch back to the original bitcoin chain. Assuming they even get to that point.


No there is no easy way to measure this. This is a feature not a bug, bitcoin is meant to be a currency with privacy.

None of the logic in that thread has changed in the last 4 years, the only thing that changed is the political maneuvering. In a very real sense, most of what was worth saying about the block size debate has already been said in 2013.


These protocols don't work in adversarial conditions, miners can put transactions into blocks that were not previously broadcast on the network and with that cost other miners money. Big miners will be able to make money by not following the rules and forcing out smaller miners, and that's bad if we want a decentralized bitcoin.


The empty block attack requires &gt;50%, petertodd's reasoning works at much lower hashrate proportions.


Only to choose the history of transactions, not the other rules.


All of these things requires &gt;50% to do.

Good post OP.
This chart shows us the fee rates of transactions that get mined ( This Sunday and Monday we're actually seeing actually half empty blocks, so in theory any transaction will get mined regardless of fees.
I've regularly gotten transactions mined at 1sat/b due to waiting for low-demand times.
Some people are saying "transactions take long". No, transactions can be fast if you're willing to pay more. If you're willing to wait then you can get it much cheaper. The block space market asks you to make a tradeoff between fees and waiting time.

Ok, understandable.
It's worth noting that Core doesn't have the power to do that. There are plenty of people like me who are not Core developers but would prefer bitcoin to never hard fork. The best Core can do is say they'll talk to the community and try to gain their support for a hard fork.

The original mailing list email is good 
The summary is that the bitcoin economic majority is what decides the rules of bitcoin. Using the miners is a convienant shortcut which has unfortunately stopped working. But the economic majority can activate segwit themselves without asking the miners.
The miners can create more than 21 million bitcoin if they wanted, but they won't be able to trade those coins for anything real because the bitcoin economic majority will reject them in the same way a careful goldsmith rejects fool's gold. If the economic majority starts rejecting segwit-invalid blocks, which is what a UASF is, then miners will have to follow those rules.

Nice blog post.
I think as well as talking, it's also valuable to encourage and educate parts of the real economy about the benefits of using full nodes as their wallet. Many bitcoin users don't even read reddit or twitter, but as long as they hold onto their full node the miner's attacks will always fail.
It's been very worrying to think about how a small number of Electrum server operators and network node could move the vast majority of bitcoin users who use lightweight wallet to a new currency without their knowledge or consent.

75% of mining power is not 75% of the economy. Miners are the employees of the economy, not it's masters, because they have to sell their newly mined bitcoin to pay their bills.
It follows that miners cannot force the economy to 'upgrade' their full nodes. If anything, 75% of miners mining invalid blocks creates an opportunity for new miners to come in.
@_date: 2016-02-11 01:09:41
75% of mining power has nothing to do with the economic majority. Miners work for full nodes, not the other way around.

All those people putting uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148


I disagree with this. Hard forks can create a permanent fork that never re-merges. But because UASFs are soft forks, they can re-merge, all it takes is for the UASF-chain to have more economic support (a higher price) than the non-UASF-chain and then it will be re-united.

Looks like the threat of UASF made the miners fall in line.
All the people saying "look how communication worked" have completely missed the point. You **never** go to the negotiating table with nothing. Make no mistake that the litecoin community's readyness to go for a UASF was **crucial** in making the miners say they'll activate segwit.

Right so your plan is to query each of the 50 or so addresses in your wallet individually through a different tor circuit? That could work I guess, it still has the problem that the queries would come quite close to each other in time so could be correlated that way.
And then what if bc.i lies to you? If they say you got paid when you really didnt, if they say you got paid but those coins were just fake inflation past 21m. If you are interested in bitcoin as a decentralized censorship-resistant currency then bc.i would not be suitable for you.

Asicboost is a tech that makes mining easier. It's patented by Bitmain (the ones pushing BU and blocking segwit) and it gives a $100mm per year incentive to block all kinds of useful soft forks like segwit, committed bloom filters and most kinds of fraud proofs. Also provides an incentive to mine empty or near-empty blocks, defeating the point of the blockchain as a payment network.
Here's some links:

Nobody knows, bitcoin is designed with privacy so it's basically impossible to measure. It's also very hard to tell between lost bitcoins and investment bitcoins.
Even if you look on the blockchain for transactions, in apps like JoinMarket you've got investment bitcoins that undergo transactions all the time for the purpose of earning a small income from them.
For getting an idea of the amount being exchanged I'd look at the market price of blockchain space, currently [170 satoshi-per-byte for confirmation within 1 block]( that people find it worthwhile to pay to move bitcoins.

Multisig is a great cheap solution. Obviously if you're trying to make money from bitcoin as an investment you want to keep costs down.
The idea of multisig is that malware or hackers are very unlikely to compromise all your hardware all at once. So you create bitcoin wallets that require several keys stored in many different locations to spend your coins.

This is incorrect. When one miner has &gt;50% then there is no number of confirmations that are safe. I don't see how many margin is created that competition can fill, the 50% attacking miner makes more profit than anyone else because they can make money from the fraud they engage in.

Nobody is proposing a hard fork to fix asicboost, instead it would be a soft fork that fixes only the covert form which is what's blocking segwit and other tech.
Regarding not connecting to public pools, Antpool's stratum server appears to have special commands for asicboost. 
You talk about miners being in this to make money, but bitcoin users are also in this to make money. And bitcoin users see miners blocking great tech like segwit [and other stuff]( because of this asicboost. Well sorry but that can't go on, users want segwit and miners will have to find other ways to make money.

Economic consensus doesn't work by mere numbers of nodes (which could easily be sybils.) Consider that the single full node behind localbitcoin.com, which has far more economic weight than a node running on cloud hardware somewhere that nobody even uses as a wallet. The localbitcoin.com node probably does not have an open port to improve security, meaning it wont even appear on those flawed node-counting sites.
That is why the argument is rubbish. The economic majority has the power, not the miners or sybil nodes that someone just creates by the dozen.

Electrum Personal Server is an implementation of the Electrum wallet server protocol that allows users to point their Electrum wallet at their own full node. It allows the user to benefit from all of Bitcoin Core's resource-saving features like pruning, blocksonly and disabled txindex. All of Electrum's feature-richness like hardware wallet integration, multisignature wallets, offline signing, seed phrases and so on can still be used, but connected only to the user's own full node.
Full release notes:
* Implemented tor broadcasting of transactions, which happens by default if tor is running on the same machine.
* Also check that the last address of each master public key has been imported, along with the first three.
* Add bandwidth usage per day and blockchain size to the server banner
* Support using `vsize` instead of `size` for the mempool calculation, which is the correct behaviour for Bitcoin Core 0.19
* Allow rescan date to also be passed via CLI args. Wait for any rescanning to finish on startup. This allows Electrum Personal Server to be more easily used with scripting.
* Various other bugfixes

Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic and other alternative clients implement different consensus rules. Basically they are different currencies.
They accept blocks which are larger than 1mb but the reference Bitcoin Core client does not. So there will arise two different blockchains which diverge at some point. Bitcoin Core will follow the chain with &lt;1mb blocks no matter what, the other alternative clients will follow the other blockchain.

Hard forks are difficult because everybody must agree to it and update their full node. This difficulty of creating successful hard forks is all what enforces bitcoin's important rules like the 21m money supply limit and no confiscation of other people's coins.

There are many pro-segwit big holders too. Who remembers that bet between Loaded and Roger Ver (which ended up not happening) that involved tens of thousands of bitcoins.
The difference is that miners have to pay millions of dollars in electricity per day so they can't be messing around attempting to move markets. That power lies with holders.
When bitfinex made the BU future token we saw it quickly fell to very low values compared to actual bitcoin. I know of at least two big holders who moved some coins into bitfinex in order to sell BU.
Whats more, replay attacks are totally possible to work around. You send a coin back and forth until you get different UTXOs on either side of the chain, and then coinjoin that on each chain so they're only valid on that chain. This stops all replay attacks on an exchange's hot wallet.
@_date: 2019-04-18 16:24:58

@_date: 2016-02-25 20:25:18
Not exactly. Every bitcoin node in the network verifies that the rules are being followed for themselves. Rules like no double spending of bitcoins, no spending a coin without the owner's say-so.
All that mining nodes do is determine the history and ordering of transactions, that's the one thing that individual bitcoin nodes cant do on their own.
It also means that miners cant create more than 21 million bitcoins or break any other rules because the actual nodes in the network would reject them.
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:09:22
It will continue until the segwit-valid chain gets more work than the segwit-invalid chain. The segwit-invalid chain will be annihilated in a blockchain reorganization at that point and all nodes will again be on the same chain.
The fact that segwit-invalid chains have this property that they can just disappear means their price will be lower. Investors will demand a higher risk premium for holding them and short-sellers will push down the price hoping to profit.
Since hashpower closely follows price, the lower price of the segwit-invalid coin (all else equal) will be the thing that stops it existing.

You've come up with possible reasons but missed the (IMO) obvious one: bitmain wanted to have a remote kill switch that they could selectively switch off their customer's miners, and use that to put bitcoin development under their own control.
Look how the auth_url is hardcoded, it requires a recompile to change. There's no way the owner of the mining unit could realistically change it to put it under their own control. All the control is with bitmain.

The 75% support you speak of is only 75% support of mining power, not 75% of the economy.
Miners are the employees of the economy not its masters, because miners depend on the economy to sell their bitcoins needed to pay bills. It follows that miners are unable to force the economy to do anything. It would be like saying that if 75% of miners started mining Zetacoin then everyone would suddenly start using that instead of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's liquidity has strong network effects. There's Bitcoin ATMs everywhere and LocalBitcoins, but no such Ethereum ATMs or LocalEthereum. Now and going forward it's always cheaper and easier to just buy bitcoin and trade, so there's no incentive to ever work on those competitors that trade alts for anything else.
Market capitalization is an easily manipulated metric, liquidity is not. Look around you, how many places offer to trade any alts.

Bitcoin would be bank transfers which don't require your real name to use, don't require passing AML/KYC, can be used to donate to wikileaks, can be used to gamble online, can be sent anonymously, can't be confescated, can't be frozen, can't be inflated. 
**These** are the properties that make bitcoin special and regular bank transfers can never match them.
And anyway there are layer 2 ideas to scale bitcoin safely, LN is the best but there are other ideas that can't be blocked by the miners.

This does not support your case. The first graph shows that fees were higher during the 2013 bubble. The second graph about difficulty is completely irrelevant and the third graph about the block size going up means a fee market for block space is about to develop. I don't see any problems here.






Bitcoin is not a restaurant.
You're missing the fact that one blockchain transaction can represent countless numbers of real economic transactions. In this far off future where bitcoin is used by many orders of magnitude more people, the lightning network could provide enough capacity. Plus it would bring other benefits like instant confirmations, improved privacy and far better scalability.

In my experience, it's better to simply poll `listtransactions` every few seconds.

Also note that TXIDs can change until the transaction gets a confirmation because of transaction malleability, so you have to check the output address not the TXID.

What kind of compromise are you looking for? The only way I can see it happening is if it doesn't involve a hard fork.
Not to mention that the Core devs have only limited power. Even if you convinced them, you'd still have to convince a large amount of ordinary bitcoiners who believe in decentralization and censorship-resistance. There is no way that they would support the risk of breaking bitcoin only to make the lives of a VC-funded spying censoring walled-garden like Coinbase.com any easier.

Yes but an electrum server can link your addresses together and know they are owned by the same person. They know the entire balance and history of your wallet.
Also the electrum server can link your IP address with your bitcoin addresses unless you use tor.
All kinds of discussions about privacy should start with who you want to be private from. Some users of bitcoin would be perfectly happy with letting an electrum server know that information. However many would not, for example users of TailsOS. (Privacy in bitcoin is hard, better people use Electrum than blockchain.info's web wallet)

That's comparing apples with oranges, it won't bring any useful insight.
Instead compare two mining ecosystems: a completely centralized and very decentralized one, both of which produce blocks with transactions.
In one the centralized miner can rewrite history at will no matter how deep in the blockchain. In the other, waiting for 6 confirmations means you have a very high probability that the coins are actually yours. It should be obvious which coin has a higher value.

You are wrong.
The UASF movement had just one aim, which was to activate segwit on bitcoin soon after 1st August 2017. That happened. The fact that the miner surrendered even before that date doesn't take away from the victory, on the contrary it demonstrates its true power.

Fees being paid prove people are willing to pay them, and that the transactions are not being faked (or at least they're more expensive to fake now)
Also a final thing I forgot, the fees going up prove that the idea of bitcoin being paid by fees after inflation is over might actually work.
@_date: 2017-04-05 10:20:31
That is correct. The blockchain charges for transactions on a per-kilobyte basis.
In that situation you could get off cheaper by waiting for a Sunday when demand for block space is low and then combining all the $25 DCA outputs into one for a very cheap miner fee.
People are working on new technology called Lightning that would allow for very cheap and instant bitcoin payments that would be great for OP's use case, but malicious miners are blocking the necessary segwit update for it.
@_date: 2017-04-07 21:07:39
I understand the risks you take and value them, but that risk does not justify breaking bitcoin.
Respect has to go both ways and miners have to respect the users. Users do not want a centralized bitcoin, and I think that's totally fair enough.
[Here]( is a list of more than a hundred bitcoin businesses and projects that are ready or nearly-ready for segwit. Yet miners have not activated segwit, so sorry but who is disrespecting who again? Many of these bitcoin businesses have also taken risks betting on bitcoin being able to support a large number of transactions.
And anyway, non-Bitmain miners would actually benefit from segwit being activated, because it stops Bitmain's patented secret asicboost advantage. Mining is a zerosum game after all, activating segwit is in your own benefit as a miner unless you're Jihan Wu.

If you're talking about lowering the block size limit to 1MB, that was a soft fork because previously valid rules became invalid, rather than previously invalid rules becoming valid.

This is not true. Bitcoin is not a "lets all trust the miners" system and never has been.
If you run a full node then it will reject invalid blocks *no matter what*. So evil miners can create a very long chain that steals bitcoins or creates more than 21m, and it will all be for nothing because your full node wallet will say that they are not real bitcoins.

In your OP you write about free-market principles and the invisible hand, yet in your reply to me you appeal to "usability". I would say that too-large blocks also hurt bitcoin's usability because they centralize it and therefore make it worthless.
To me, it's still seems true that following your logic of "free market ueber alles", the money supply cap is central planning and therefore has no justification.
Here's another way to think about it. If bitcoin was magically changed to give every node the freedom to create as many bitcoins as it liked, the bulk of investors, users and merchants would quickly abandon bitcoin and switch to another currency that still had a money supply cap. The same is true for the block size limit. We see the bitcoin price dropped when Bitcoin-XT and Bitcoin-Classic were announced and released. We see the price rose when it became clear that those hostile hard forks would not win. It's pretty obvious to me that the free market of holders wants an "arbitrary" block size limit, same way they want an "arbitrary" money supply cap.
Forget about Satoshi. There were lots of things that were not known about how bitcoin worked back in 2009. If Satoshi was still around he'd know but he's been gone for 6 years now. We should be asking what's best for bitcoin now.

How is this different from the situation today where full nodes can delete old blockchain data when you run with `prune=550`


If someone wanted to spend your coins, they would still have to provide a valid signature which only the private key holder can create. Just because some nodes have deleted older signatures from years ago doesn't change this.


It's more complex than that. Segwit has other benefits:  and one of them is to improve scaling by removing a quadratic-scaling signature verification issue

I've read this pdf.
This idea would benefit by describing in more detail how it actually works on a technical level. Right now it mostly describes only its features and benefits. Because of this the pdf comes off sounding like mere hype.
For example it doesn't actually define what a "pond" is. Is it a centralized server that all miners connect to? Is it a p2p network like what p2pool uses? The document doesn't seem to say.
The proposal would also benefit by more analysis of adversarial conditions. Everything in bitcoin has to be secured by cryptography and game theory. The document talks about having the coinbase transaction have multiple outputs each paying to every miner in the pool, but what if a single miner doesn't follow this protocol and claims the entire reward for themselves? There must be some mechanism to stop this but by my reading the document doesn't explain how.

Could you simply send a wire transfer to an exchange like bitstamp or kraken and buy bitcoins from there? Another option might be looking on localbitcoins for people who sell bitcoins for Western Union transfer or something like that.
A final option could be to try to find someone who regularly travels internationally, ask them to buy some bitcoins when abroad that you'll buy from them when they come back to Columbia.

Exchange fees can be low if you identify yourself. Exchanges like bitstamp and kraken charge 0.2% However as you mention that will mean the powers that be know you owned bitcoin.
Anonymous/private methods of exchange usually cost a higher fee, but depending on the method it won't be too much. In my area cash deposit on localbitcoins has a markup of 4%, and all the banks in this country blockade anything bitcoin related so we must trade in secret.
Note that in many places you can simply spend bitcoin to buy the things you need depending, so exchange costs for selling your bitcoin again might not be an issue. The bitcoin debit cards you mention would allow this for anything that accepts Visa, but those cards have fees. Then there's many specialist places that accept bitcoin in exchange for things like gift cards that you can use to buy goods and services.
For long-term storage where you don't trade often, paper storage is by far the best way. People better understand the idea of keeping a piece of paper safe, and you know it won't mysteriously become corrupted like a hard drive. To create a bitcoin wallet stored on paper, download and install wallet software like Electrum or Armory which has the mnemonic seed backup method and write that seed down on paper. When you want to use your wallet just recover it from the seed.
You can also memorize this seed if you're ever crossing borders or otherwise worry about being shaken down by strongmen. Here are instructions for that

The point is that using a full node wallet doesn't rely on altruism, actually the user gets a direct benefit.
A major problem with having a monetary incentive for nodes is that nobody has figured out a way to do it that isn't vulnerable to sybil attacks.

Run a bitcoin full node and connect to it with json-rpc. It can generate addresses for you and there are procedures to call that can tell you when payment arrives. Also a full node will give you all the benefits of trustlessness and security that bitcoin provides.
Remember you can run in pruning mode and limit the bandwidth consumption, so your full node doesn't have to use up a lot of resources.

This blog post might help in your understanding: 
My short summary would be that bitcoins exist as coins, which are also known as unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). These coins live on addresses, whoever holds the private key for that address can spend the coins that live on it.

The pruning only applies to the full node. Electrum Personal Server itself is a small script with barely any state (which isn't saved to disk anyway so theres no need for pruning). So yes you can run this even if you don't have much hard disk space. (Although if you ran it on a VPS then the VPS provider can see what all your bitcoin addresses are).
Regarding broadcasting through tor. Yes that is a feature I've got planned. See here

It is a lightweight version of ElectrumX you could say. Instead of indexing every address and transaction ever recorded, it only tracks the users own addresses and transactions. So it's very very lightweight, and is compatible with pruning/blocksonly and all the other resource-saving options. Architectures like ElectrumX a quite resource-intensive and so push users towards centralized solutions which destroy their privacy and introduce trust into the system.


This is exactly what Electrum Personal Server does. It allows you to connect the Electrum wallet to your own full node, via a very lightweight script.

What your brother was using them for is a completely different issue to this theft now.
Bitcoins themselves are not illegal. This theft is well within the remit of the police. I'd say it's a criminal not civil matter, so getting the police involved rather than a lawyer would be the thing to do here.
Think of it this way, imagine that your brother had $90k in cash in his house which his roommate stole, that would be theft just the same. That bitcoins are digital cash instead of physical makes no difference.

Altcoins are not diluting bitcoin. A bitcoin is a bitcoin, an altcoin is an altcoin, and it's always possible to tell between them.
Compare to banknotes. A bank could issue some notes at the start and then years later the same bank could engage in hyperinflationary printing money. When someone gives you a new banknote you have no way to telling it's different from the old original kind. This would be true dilution.

Yes indeed. The investor should look forward to the rapidly-approaching time when inflation drops and miners have to fund themselves with transactions fee.
Since 75% of all bitcoins that will ever exist have been mined, the time when transaction fees become important will be here very soon.
The investor should also look forward to a time when bitcoin comes under attack. The only way it can survive is if it's suitably decentralized.  Hostile hard forks that don't have consensus are damaging to this.

1) Hardware wallets and most software wallets have a mnemonic backup seed. You write it down on paper or otherwise store it, if you lose your wallet you can use the seed to recover your wallet.
Here is an example of such a seed:
    witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least
2) Different Bitcoin wallets interface with the live bitcoin network in different ways. Wallets backed by a full node (like Bitcoin-Qt, Armory or JoinMarket) are the most secure in terms of trust. They fully verify all the rules of bitcoin and so make sure nobody can print infinite bitcoins for example.
My favorite is Bitcoin-Qt, although the most appropriate for very new users is an SPV wallet like Electrum.
3) Yes, also online wallets can lie to you about your true bitcoin balance. So like a bank they might run a fractional reserve. Also online wallets all run inside a browser which is a very insecure way of doing cryptography.

Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It'll be distributed to miners when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half every 4 years.
first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins

I'd say the objectives of the algorithm are to be in-line with a currency that has a low requirement for trust. For example, you don't have to trust any institution that they won't create inflation to debase your holdings.

Electrum's protocol uses less data and far fewer round trips than BIP37, so the user experiance is much better because it sync's faster. BIP37 needs to query each block of which there could be hundreds of thousands, while Electrum only needs to query its own addresses of which there are maybe 20.

Right, I apologise for that. Unfortunately the block size hard fork conflict means tensions are escalated and often people assume the worst.
I don't know why Satoshi wrote that, maybe he didn't appreciate the marginal nature of inflation (that generated per year / existing coins is the important metric), or maybe he was talking about when fees take over from reward (since right now fees are still a small part of the reward), or maybe he was being misleading to try to get people to adopt bitcoin.

Not really, you don't need to have it searchable and converting data formats is not very difficult. You could design your system to be really inefficient and index everything but users could choose alternative wallets that aren't as wasteful. [Not all middleware has to be expensive in data](
The most computationally expensive part of a full node is verifying the rules of the entire blockchain, keeping track of your own addresses and transactions is much smaller in relative terms. The Bitcoin Core full node has always had an in-built wallet.

Let's go back before 1989 in Eastern Europe. It was illegal to own and use foreign currency like German marks, French franks or US dollars. No merchant in the eastern block accepted them as payment because they were illegal, but they were still currency and very highly regarded (far more than the local communist banknotes for example). So I don't think lack of merchant acceptance makes something useless or not a currency.
Bitcoin first gets adopted in places where it actually provides value. It doesn't provide much value for grocery stores and gas stations. It does for online gambling, permissionless donations, online value transfer without an ID and anywhere where a censorship-resistant digital currency is useful.

David Harding was contacted by a journalist apparently about this story. His reply is here: 
This is not a new idea. It's a known thing since 2009 or 2010 that anybody can store things on the blockchain. It also contains stuff about the Tiananmen square incident which is illegal in China. Also at one point somebody added malware signatures to the blockchain so antivirus software thought bitcoin was malware. There's also an ascii-art image of Ben Bernanke.
This data is very non-trivial to actually access. Block files are opaque, huge data files, to extract anything from it needs specific tooling, that doesn't come with any of the node software.
It's a fairly common legal situation to have to deal with other people's crap, e.g. ISPs have exemptions for this kind of stuff because proactive enforcement there is too expensive. Also for any kind of legal problems you'd have to prove intent, unless people had specific tools for analyzing the blockchain that won't happen.
Also for years bitcoin users and miners have been able to enable pruning if they don't want to store the blockchain. So what that says about "all blockchain data is downloaded and persistently stored by users" is rubbish too. The blockchain is one of the least efficient storage methods ever invented, in the long term the problem will fix itself because miner fees will make this kind of thing not economical.
tl;dr Ignore the FUD.

Yes you're absolutely right. Derp
I told people calculating anonymity sets can be hard :)
If you assume a threat model where an adversary only passively observes the blockchain, they wouldn't know that the same 50 people made another coinjoin, they'd have to assume that maybe 50 new people created the coinjoin, and then the total anonymity set could be 50+50 = 100. (Or at least thats an upper bound) But even so, way lower than the 2500 value I said.

Which full node backs your Ledger?
If you use your Ledger with the Ledger company's web wallet then they can see what all your bitcoin addresses are and probably connect them with your IP address. That's not very private. To get privacy you also need to back your wallet with your own full node.

Full nodes make bitcoin security because they have the power to reject invalid transactions. If full node wallets are not used by people actually using bitcoin to receive transactions then they'll never reject invalid transactions, and then an attacker who tries to (for example) print infinite bitcoins will get them accepted by the economy.

The coordinator is a centralized server.
Wasabi wallet uses blind signatures in a scheme where the server doesn't know the links between inputs and outputs. You could read about blind signatures on the wikipedia page, but (to oversimplify slightly) what they do is allow someone to sign a message without revealing what that message is. This is used in Wasabi where the user's wallets can sign a transaction input without revealing which transaction input is being signed.

This is not true. What do you think he did?
Mike Hearn utterly trashed the privacy of litewallet users w/ BIP37's total lack or privacy, fought for blocking Tor, fought to add censorship directly to the tor network, tried to add address blacklists to bitcoin. The only code contribution to Bitcoin Core of his that I'm aware of nearly destroyed the entire network in an accidental chain split. Good riddance.
People point to his BitcoinJ which implemented on the previously-mentioned privacy-destroying BIP37, but it also wasn't used much. Mobile wallets using BitcoinJ are almost so rare to be unobservant, they have terrible performance due to blockchain load. By far most mobile users use server based or custodial wallets.

Yes the point of miners is to be decentralized.
There's no point mining blocks if the history of transactions can be rewritten. If a single entity gets &gt;50% of hash power then their probability of successfully reversing a bitcoin transaction is 100% Who would accept bitcoin if their transactions could be clawed back even if they waited for 100 confirmations? Nobody.

Repeated coinjoins really are awesome. If all 50 entities repeated their Wasabi coinjoin then the anonymity set becomes (50)^2 = 2500. The number grows exponentially.

Hi nopara,
Do you have any plans to optionally allow users to point their Wasabi Wallet to their own full node? Not for privacy but for verification (i.e. making sure they're really transacting in bitcoin and not something like S2X)
It could be done by having Wasabi Wallet obtain block headers via the p2p protocol from the linked full node. This would be compatible with pruning because the wallet would only request block headers and not entire blocks.
@_date: 2018-11-11 22:06:28

@_date: 2019-01-08 11:24:11


Yes that's right. This way would only be for verification rather than anything to do with learning the wallet history. It would be fairly simple to code as it just involves getting block headers over the p2p protocol from one place instead of another.
Using the Bitcoin Core wallet over RPC would stop the need for client-side filters, and as you say, would be way more complex to code and use.

The security comes from when you receive bitcoin transactions with a full node wallet.
The power of a full node comes from its ability to reject invalid payments. So for example if a someone tried to print more than 21 million coins and tried to pay you with those bitcoins, your full node would reject those transactions and so the malicious entity would not be able to find someone who would accept their fake bitcoins.

Good ones are bitcoin magazine's series: 
And let's talk bitcoin's blog post: 
Real ELI5: Lightning Network is a series of tubes for money. All Lightning Network nodes are connected together in a big network so payments can be sent via intermediaries, that way users only need three or four active payment channels (or tubes) to be able to transact with anybody on the lightning network. The bitcoins follow little programs called smart contracts which mean that nobody except the rightful owner of the bitcoins can transact with them. Lightning Network is a more efficient way of using bitcoin because payments will be routed through a small number of nodes, instead of being broadcast to every single bitcoin full node and miner.

Tor has different properties to bitcoin. 
Did you use your node as a wallet ?
Unfortunately the properties of bitcoin full nodes are widely misunderstood. People running them on datacenters only help new nodes synchronize. If they don't use them as their wallet they get none of the benefits of privacy, security and trustlessness, and do not much to improve the decentralization and censorship resistance.
Really it's in your direct self interest to use a full node as your wallet. I guess people just prefer to easy setup of lightweight wallets, even if the wallets can easily be tricked by miners.

I would say the UASF was pro-decentralized-bitcoin. If one day Core doesn't support a decentralized bitcoin then people will just drop it.
Many of Core developers were against the UASF because they thought the risk wasn't worth it for segwit. Large parts of the economic consensus left Core and adopted another full node. Once the UASF was successful and segwit was activated most people went back to Core's software (although I still sometimes see BIP148 nodes connected to my node).
This is good because it protects the Core developers. Anyone who wants to attack bitcoin knows there's no point coercing Core developers because they don't have much power.

You need to use a wallet backed by a full node, otherwise if you use a lightweight wallet then the server can easily see your bitcoin addresses and unmix you. You also need to avoid amount correlation, if an adversary sees btc going in and a very similar amount of btc going out then it doesn't take too much imagination to link the two.
Using a privacy altcoin for mixing fixes just one part of the privacy question, you still need to be careful with all the other stuff.

Actually your CC info is leaked because of centralization.
Because centralized payment systems can only support reversible transactions, merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for extra information like billing address, name, etc
It's only because of bitcoin's decentralization that it can be used without registering a real name or excluding users based on age, nationality or residency.
You should think more carefully about where bitcoin's properties from come. [Start here]( ALL of the unique properties come from decentralization, that's why it must be protected above all else.

Full node wallets check all the rules of bitcoin and reject invalid transactions and blocks. If bitcoin is digital gold then a full node wallet is your own personal goldsmith which checks that incoming payments are real.
It makes the whole ecosystem more robust if adversaries find it harder to get away with fraud. So using a full node wallet helps yourself and also the entire community.

A private key could also be used along with others to create a multisignature address.
Also a private key can create either a compressed pubkey or an uncompressed pubkey, which each correspond to two different addresses. Although uncompressed pubkeys are deprecated and I'm not aware of any wallet which still uses them

AML/KYC is really bad for privacy as you say. Avoiding them would do more for privacy than any coinjoin/coinswap/LN tech. Crypto tricks are irrelevant if all you do is move your coins between coinbase and binance.
To me it's clear the future for privacy is off-chain. With LN you can make purchases instantly and they aren't broadcast to everyone in the network and stored forever on a public record. Even if you transact with an AML/KYC with LN there will be much less coin-tracking information available to them.

He's talking about using multisig escrow for trading. In his example you and the merchant/thief create a 2of2 address. The customer pays money into it and if the merchant scams then the money is locked up unspendable.
Since then it turns out this model doesn't perfectly align incentives, today people use 2of3 multisig instead with an arbitrator holding the third key to be a tie-breaker.
However it's interesting that 2of2 multisig is extensively used in payment channels and lightning. So it's like satoshi's example except it's computer servers somewhere doing the trading instead of people.

Bitcoin's security model relies on being well-connected to the rest of the network, one downside of blocksat is that it could easily cut off nodes from the real bitcoin network. It would be very useful to have the above suggestion because then people could still be well-connected to other peers but also save a massive amount of bandwidth by using the satellite.
2) Are you aware of anyone using a blockstream satellite full node with electrum personal server?

Lightning bitcoin transactions don't need to be broadcast to every node in the network, and don't need to be mined into blocks. They inherently use much much less resources than on-chain transaction, so we can expect them to always be much cheaper.

Reducing block size means less resources are required by full nodes.
The block size relates to the rate of increase of the blockchain. The blockchain is getting bigger all the time because more transactions are made, as you say ~50GB is added every year.

If you want find bitcoin users, look in places where bitcoin's properties make it useful: 
* Bitrefill is a service for crediting your phone with bitcoin worldwide, it matches bitcoin's global nature well which is probably why it gets [15000 transactions per month](
* Bitcoin casinos are doing a roaring trade too, American users use it to get around the banking blockade against normal casinos. Also it fits with bitcoin's global and permissionless nature.
* If you go on thepiratebay you'll find hundreds of torrent uploaders posting their bitcoin addresses for donations and people actually donate to them. Permissionless donations are a great feature of bitcoin [that you'll find in lots of places.](
* Gamers [especially streamers]( also occasionally get bitcoin donations. They can convert to cash, use to buy steam games or trade for game items such as counterstrike skins or WoW gold.
* People in certain countries cannot access good banking infrastructure, for example bitcoin is the only way for [this guy]( to buy on steam and amazon.
* Lots of people get paid in bitcoin across borders, especially if they can't access bank accounts in their country.
* Hosting providers, VPNs and VPS services almost always take bitcoin payments these days. It fits with bitcoin's global and private nature.

If you don't know about it already, read about JoinMarket. A project that improves bitcoin's privacy and fungibility, and it breaks Chainalysis and other on-chain spies. JoinMarket actually exists today, it has a GUI and Electrum plugin and has been improving privacy for 2 years now. It needs more development work to make it easier to use but it's totally usable by any slightly technical person. JoinMarket was hit pretty hard by rising miner fees but it now has segwit and the fee rates have dropped anyway.
OP's example of coinbase.com banning donators happened because people used coinbase.com as a web wallet. If you use a web wallet like that then no amount of on-chain privacy will save you. One reason for JoinMarket's low usage is right now it requires the user to run a full node for maximum privacy. One day they'll be other methods like pointing the JoinMarket GUI to your own full node, or downloading blocks from the network in a private way to sync your wallet.
By the way, another example of coinbase.com's ruining privacy because the KAT torrent guy used it as a web wallet to accept donations. So pro-tip: if you're accepting donations for semi-legal sites, don't use coinbase.com as a webwallet!


The avoidance of change outputs as in RHavar's comment is also a very useful technique if that applies: 
In the long term I'm most excited about Lightning because it can take transactions off-chain. The blockchain is very bad for privacy so just the simple step of having off-chain transactions can massively help. I've been following the space and the LN devs are obviously very aware of privacy issues so I'm sure they'll code the system to be as private as possible.
And there's other proposed tech: coinswap, tumblebit, zerolink. They don't exist yet but are exciting ideas nonetheless.
Can we stop bringing up Monero or any other altcoins, this thread is being brigaded right now. Monero has far worse scaling than bitcoin so soon enough running Monero full nodes will become very hard indeed. After that happens there won't be any point in on-chain privacy if Monero miners have destroyed the entire currency. Monero pumpers like to say *"Monero doesn't have the same block size issue as bitcoin"* but this is a complete lie. Bitcoin's relative ease of running full nodes is the major factor that saved it during the scalability drama. Monero doesn't solve the web wallet problem either, if coinbase.com supported Monero they could ban people just the same.

Medium also deleted my comment on that article. I'll paste it here instead.


I have no idea where the number 50 comes from. Surely it depends on your threat model, if you're hiding from the police (as this article says) then an anonymity set of 50 isn't enough at all. The police can easily knock on 50 doors or send 50 emails. Even if you want to hide from targeted adverts, an anonymity set of only 50 could still mean that you get personal adverts since they work on a statistical basis.
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:52:32


This is a very simplistic analysis.
Such companies have a massive incentive to exaggerate how good they actually are. I've not seen much concrete evidence at all that tracking companies do any good. I know of at least one bitcoin online casino that is able to set up its wallet system so customers can easily send straight from coinbase.com without getting banned.
Altcoin pumpers keep crying crocodile tears about fungibility but can never point to any concrete negative consequence today. Where are the "tainted" coins that stop bitcoin having value? Not saying bitcoin privacy and fungibility is perfect, but it's in a better state than some altcoin pumpers claim.

* Full nodes don't charge for their services. There's no income to lose.
* "Breaking worldwide consensus" is not a thing. With respect, it sounds like you're fundamentally confused about how bitcoin works. Consensus is the idea that people who agree cooperative, not that everyone must agree.
* It's not the same as today. Today bitcoin's security model relies on large parts of the economy using full node wallets.

@_date: 2019-01-04 01:57:20
OK I see.
They might not have to actually kick down doors. If or most of the 50 coinjoin coins get sent to a KYC/AML exchange then the police only need to send a few emails to figure out who their owners are. Yes having them in different countries can help, but the state has been known to cooperate internationally. As I said it all depends on your threat model, the police are one of the strongest entities around.
Needless to say most people only need privacy to stop their trades being front-run or to stop their ISP sending them targeted adverts. It's fun to think about evading the police but that's it. Actual criminals already have way better ways of avoiding detection than something like coinjoin, it's just a cost of doing their illegal business.

It's not a question of *should*, it's a question of how bitcoin works on a technical level.
Bitcoin's long-term survival **requires** that most of the economic majority runs full nodes. It's as simple as that, if you think it's a stringent requirement then hopefully you can help invent some new technology that improves this.

A full node wallet is essential for privacy, without it the Electrum server or other random full node can see everything you do.
You wouldn't accept gold coin or cash as payment without carefully checking whether it was genuine. Why don't people do the same thing with their bitcoin? If bitcoin is digital gold then a full node wallet is your own personal goldsmith who checks that incoming payments are real.

Yes joinmarket transactions and all coinjoins are recognizable, but that doesn't mean their privacy is gone. Indeed Wasabi wallet coinjoins are even more recognizable since they're published on the website.
Plenty of people have used joinmarket (including the 445 btc case linked in the article) and to my knowledge no mix has ever been undone. If what you said were true then at least some of them would have been found, but that hasn't happened. Yes yield-geneators main aim is to make money, but the market incentives are carefully made so that privacy is the result (the 445 btc case used yield generator). Each coinjoin creates new outputs where there is uncertainty and therefore privacy. I don't know what you mean by joinmarket passing often miz different levels of segwit, in fact joinmarket wallets are only either fully-segwit or fully-nonsegwit.

From what I've seen of the on-chain-side, you'll never be happy with a "moderate" increase. All your reasons for raising the block size apply equally up to 8GB or whatever number you were asking for at the start. Scaling on-chain is a loser game.
Far from supporting segwit, the big blocker side blocked it for 9 months as a hostage to try to get their hard fork. It only became activated [because of the UASF](
Sure stick around, use bitcoin, add to it's value. I've got nothing against that, but if you use bitcoin then you have to follow its rules. Those rules are enforced in every single full node distributed around the world, and you can't change them.

Don't forget situations like political confiscation, or financial crisis. They happen in to adults non-communist countries too.
Back in 2007 in the last financial crisis, a big fear was that if banks went bust then the financial infrastructure would stop working (ATMs would close, bank transfer wouldn't work, etc, etc). With bitcoin we can have a working financial infrastructure regardless of what risks are taken by investment banks.
Also there's the privacy aspect. Transacting online with legacy methods always involves revealing your real life ID. So for example if you want to buy a VPN for privacy reasons, you always have to give up your real name when you pay with VISA. With bitcoin you can buy a VPN without giving up your real name. This works because decentralization gives rise to irreversible transactions, if you send bitcoins to somebody and they wait for enough confirmations then then nobody can take the bitcoin from you no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what. This is a property that no centralized online payment system can *ever* have.
Finally because payments are irreversible, it's possible to program the money with smart contracts. You could use smart contracts with centralized payment methods, but the central institution could always override them so it would be pointless. Smart contracts in bitcoin will always be followed no matter what.

95% of miners only did that because they feared UASF. That's why the SegWit part happened but the hard fork part didn't.
There is plenty of evidence for this. The big blockers themselves said so: 
Another great piece of evidence is an interview of Jihan Wu in 2016. He said that his Bitmain pool WOULD NOT run segwit code unless Bitcoin Core had a hard fork release.


Bitcoin Core never had hard fork code in it. The reason Jihan Wu of Bitmain changed his mind was because of the UASF movement.

Between 2015-17 bitcoin had an internal conflict about the best way to improve scalability.
One side wanted to do a hard fork to remove the block size limit and so put every single transaction on the blockchain.
The other side said that removing the block size limit would destroy bitcoin's decentralization and there must be another way because decentralization is bitcoin's only unique feature. They suggested creating off-chain technology like Lightning Network.
A necessary update required for Lightning was called Segregated Witness (segwit) which would be added as a soft fork to bitcoin. The big blockers had support of one big miner who used their power to block activation of segwit. The pro-decentralization side created the UASF movement which was a way to technically activate segwit regardless of what the miners said, but it required a big social movement on forums, twitter, reddit and so on, for businesses and users to use the BIP148 client as their full node wallet. The UASF movement eventually won, segwit was added to bitcoin and the big blockers were driven out onto their own newly-created altcoin called bcash (Which today still hilariously claims to be "the real bitcoin")
The UASF movement was quite a big event because it showed that bitcoin's security model was still working. It had experienced a big attack and had survived. As segwit was locked-in on bitcoin, it's price doubled and then continued rising until the all-time-high of $20k per coin.

This is the most serious threat if China bans the p2p network. Because of latency effects mining may centralize inside China.
I realize that actually you could increase the block interval with a soft fork, this could help solve the latency effects and the horrified economic majority might do it via UASF if the alternative is mining fully centralized within China.
From the point of view of pre-SF nodes the miners would be inexplicably creating blocks less often than the difficulty allows them, but that is still in line with the consensus rules so the won't reject them. So the new SF rule is simply new_difficulty = old_difficulty * factor. A problem is that the old nodes would readjust difficulty downwards, so after a few retargets they would accept very-low-difficulty blocks and so be vulnerable to attack. This means the non-upgraded nodes would have to upgrade within a half-dozen retarget periods (like 6 months, depending on the difficulty factor) in order to stay secure.

Even though the interval is 10 minutes, [most blocks are found much quicker than that]( Miners must quickly get blocks and verify them otherwise there is centralization pressure.
Miners already rely on a centralized relay network so I don't think we should make the problem even worse. If anything we should increase the block interval, especially now that China looks like it might ban bitcoin on the protocol level.

There's a misunderstanding here. There's no such thing as "the mempool", each node has its own mempool and they don't have to agree with each other. Transactions must be in the blockchain for them to be irreversible, and all bitcoin nodes agree on what the blockchain is. Bitcoin's security model requires waiting for a transaction to be buried a few blocks deep in the blockchain before handing over any goods or services.


Yes, the miner's job is to add transactions to the blockchain.
There's no purpose to fake node. The examples I linked were temporary fakes that lasted only a few weeks and were aimed to be used as propaganda in the bitcoin scalablity drama 2015-2017.

BIP39 are unrelated to segwit. BIP39 is just a standard for mnemonic phrases.

There's a good talk on this from Scaling Bitcoin Milan
My view (though I'm not an expert) is it will be watchtowers run on a volunteer basis similar to how Electrum servers are run today. They'll be connected together in a network so when a LN wallet creates a new channel state it will notify it to one watchtower who will relay it to all the other watchtowers.
Also note that you only need to watch channels if you've received money, not if you only spend money.

@_date: 2018-02-03 16:39:09
A very interesting talk. The solution to essentially all these problems is true decentralized mining, with the largest single miner being smaller than 5-10% hashpower.
*We as a community need to stop telling people not to mine.*
Often when people ask about mining they get told not to. This is bad for decentralization.
*Mining isn't profitable*. No, mining is always profitable because otherwise people would stop mining and the difficulty would drop.
*You'd make more money just holding bitcoin*. Yes, and you might make even more money holding some volatile shitcoin, or gambling in Vegas. Bitcoins and bitcoin mining are two different investments, with different risk profile, different payoffs and may be suitable for different people depending on their situation.
Mining will always be a competitive industry, it will always be difficult, but if you can make it work then the rewards can be good.
As mining is a zero sum game *existing miners will always tell newbs not to mine* in order to have less competition. Bitcoin users must speak out against this because we benefit from a decentralized mining ecosystem. And make sure you choose your mining pool wisely (and switch to p2pool if the tech ever becomes good enough)

A block is added to the blockchain every 10 minutes on average. So the block size is the rate of growth of the blockchain, which right now at 2-4MB per 10 minutes or 100-200GB/year.
Increasing the block size isn't the way to make bitcoin support more transactions, a much better way is to use layer-2 technology like LN or sidechains. That allows bitcoin to use less resources and be decentralized and valuable, and also allows an unlimited number of transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:20:31
Don't use coinb.in, it's much better to use an actual wallet. Electrum supports multisig wallets so it's much more appropriate here. Everyone should have their own mnemonic phrase they keep secret, but everyone should know everyone else's master public key.

It's a fair comment and p2pool should definitely be coded from scratch. Though I think it can be argued that a reason nobody has recoded it it is because of the underlying scalability problems. P2Pool would stop doing its job of reducing variance if it got more hashrate, so why recode p2pool into a better language only for it to languish at 0.5% hashrate forever.

Don't do this, it halves the entropy in the seed and makes it easier to potentially bruteforce.
A better way is a 2of2 multisig with each seed being held by each party. That way if one key is compromise it doesn't help with bruteforcing the money.

ChainAnalysis and similar startups have a strong incentive to exaggerate how well their services actually work.
If they really could do what they say, there would be no unsolved bitcoin thefts. When actually hundreds of thousands of bitcoins have been stolen over the years from exchanges and marketplaces, with nobody ever being caught by blockchain analysis (Those who were were caught by old-fashioned police detective work).
As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, there's more to privacy than on-chain privacy. So you need to use a wallet like Bitcoin-Qt which downloads the entire blockchain and scans for your addresses. Lightweight wallets generally query a third-party server which can easily spy on you.
Centralized tumblers are not very good and certainly not worth the 2-3% fee. You can get exactly the same service by depositing and then withdrawing your bitcoins from a bitcoin casino, marketplace, exchange or any other hot wallet which doesn't require any ID. [You can even chain the deposits/withdrawals together](
r/JoinMarket is the only existing privacy solution which doesn't trust any third party. It works pretty well although it can be sometimes hard to use. It has a GUI, Electrum plugin and a bunch of tutorials though, and even uses segwit now.
There are other exciting on-chain privacy solutions for bitcoin that have been proposed: r/Tumblebit, [Zerolink]( [Coinswap]( [Confidential Transactions]( [Mimblewimble]( etc. In the long term for bitcoin a lot of privacy can be gained by taking transactions off-chain with technology like Lightning and chaumian ecash.

Electrum and Ethereum are different things. The former is a lightweight bitcoin wallet, the latter an altcoin.
Yes it connects to several servers, but that could still be beaten. For example consider a situation where the miners want to print more than 21 million bitcoins or steal a coin not belonging to them, all they have to do is set up 100 of their own Electrum servers (so the probability of an Electrum wallet connecting to only them is high) and mine a chain where that stuff happens. That would result in Electrum wallets being tricked into accepting fake bitcoins.
If you use a full node wallet then at best &gt;50% of miners can reverse a payment to you. If you use a lightweight wallet the miners can do *anything*.

Bitcoin is P2P electronic cash that is valuable over legacy systems because of the monetary autonomy it brings to its users. Bitcoin seeks to address the root problem with conventional currency: all the trust that's required to make it work -- Not that justified trust is a bad thing, but trust makes systems brittle, opaque, and costly to operate. Trust failures result in systemic collapses, trust curation creates inequality and monopoly lock-in, and naturally arising trust choke-points can be abused to deny access to due process. Through the use of cryptographic proof, decentralized networks and open source software Bitcoin minimizes and replaces these trust costs.

It's unmeasurable because bitcoin is designed with privacy in mind. That's a good thing.
It's not about what I expect, it's about how bitcoin works on a technical level. It's simply part of bitcoin's security model that most of the economy must use full nodes. If you don't think that's realistic then feel free to sell all your coins.

"This would not be a problem were it not for all the cases where it's a problem".
Also ASICBOOST is significantly more complicated, which makes is harder to create an ASIC which results in a higher barrier to entry for mining and therefore more centralized mining. Not to mention that ASICBOOST also results in empty blocks being mined.

Depends what you mean by *essentially*. The security is not at all the same.
The chance of a 51% attack isn't that small either, during the scalability drama 2015-2017 the miners were threatening to do this.
Can we expect users to download lots of data? Well maybe, that's the security model of bitcoin whether we like it or not. Maybe small time newb users could always use lightweight wallets, with intermediate users and businesses using full node wallets. There also might be developed fraud proofs which would be a third security model for bitcoin.
Interestingly that was the heart of the scalability drama. One side says block sizes should be as small as possible so full nodes can run as easily as possible, the other side doesn't care about that and wants block sizes to be really large and to hell with full nodes.


The security doesn't depend on any ratio. If the miners are attacking they can spin up thousands of their own full nodes with very little cost, so counting full nodes isn't a useful measure really.
What matters for security is if a miner creates an invalid block that breaks the rules, will they be able to sell the bitcoins from that block for real life goods and services?

Open source hardware will be a requirement for bitcoin to be fulfill it's aim.
But the fact that there is some trust required is not an argument for adding more requirements. All of bitcoin's good properties (anonymity, irreversible transactions, unfreezable, censorship-resistance, worldwide nature, programmable, push-system, etc) come from this fact. If you start adding more trust then all those properties are in danger.

You have no statistics and no way of knowing what the true % of users using full node wallets is.
If bitcoin is digital gold then a full node wallet is your own personal goldsmith who checks that the incoming transactions are actually real. So it's not about the number of full nodes. Anyone who advocates raising the block size is essentially wanting to make that checking harder and harder. The bitcoin community has shown it does not support this, which is why four separate hostile hard fork attempts have failed and why the UASF movement succeeded.

Even &gt;50% of hash power can't make a node accept invalid transactions.
So like, if all the miners decided to print themselves more than 21million bitcoins, should your node accept it? No of course not.
Miners set the history of valid transactions, users/merchants using full nodes set what makes a transaction valid.
The dangerous thing that a 51% attack can do is rewrite history, like it can reverse a payment that it previously made or censor certain transactions from ever confirming. But it can't break the validation rules.

The blockchain will never give you fast processing times. Each block takes on average 10 minutes to appear. Also a bump of 2x won't provide you low fees long-term, you'd be forced to do another hard fork to a larger block size, and pretty soon blocks would be so big that decentralization is completely destroyed.

Only if the ransomware author takes no privacy protection measures at all.


Alarmist nonsense. Once bitcoin supports lightning then all those day-to-day transactions will happen off-chain out of the eyes of any adversary. Even without lightning it is totally possible to use bitcoin in a very private way (If you disagree, I've got a list of hacks and thefts that nobody ever solved despite bitcoin being "transparent")


I'd say Bitcoin fits the profile better than Monero, because a cryptocurrency must have a low requirement for trust. Monero has far worse asymptotic scaling which means one day it will become very very costly and difficult to actually use a Monero full node. Bitcoin narrowly avoided disaster in the scalability drama because full nodes were easy to run, Monero won't have that advantage.
Monero also has no script support (which means it cant support Lightning). Its transactions take significantly longer to validate and they're significantly larger. It's has much less volume and mindshare which weakens its privacy offering because the anonymity set is so small. Not to mention that Monero has infinite inflation. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, you cannot make a similar statement for Monero.
I like that Monero is building real things that are pushing research forward and they don't present themselves as a get-rich-quick scheme, and they're mostly very friendly agreeable people. But the blind fanboyism that I see on Reddit is completely misguided.

OK so let's have a discussion about the investment case for bitcoin.
Stocks are for sure a less risky (and potentially less rewarding) investment. The bitcoin community doesn't shy away from the fact that bitcoin is experimental and highly speculative as you'll see in the first sidebar link on this subreddit called ["Don't invest recklessly"]( Generally everyone is told to not invest a large % of their net worth.
Bitcoin is aiming to be a currency, it has all the required properties of a currency being: portable, durable, divisible, recognizable, fungible, scarce, hard to counterfeit. As well as those it also has unique properties from being a decentralized digital currency. It can be sent anywhere in the world via the internet, transactions can't be censored or blocked and it doesn't need any ID to use and therefore can be used by unbanked people. Bitcoin as a store of value also has some great properties: any amount can be stored for free encrypted on a paper backup. They are easy to hide and are in your direct possession, so as long as you hold the private keys of your bitcoins then nobody can take them from you no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what. These are properties that no centralized bank account or payment network can **ever** have. Someone one referred to them as a "swiss bank account in your pocket" which seems a pretty good summary to me.
These properties can create demand for bitcoin. The supply of bitcoin is set by an algorithm, with a maximum supply of 21 million. Demand plus a fixed supply implies a non-zero price. We can debate what that price actually is and the market is figuring it out now. But to say *"What's backing them up? Nothing"* is just incorrect.
As for altcoins. Yes, bitcoin is software and software can be copied. You can see currency as a collective hallucination, people can copy bitcoin's software but they cannot copy the hallucination. They can't copy its users, developers, merchants and network effect.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:53:20
So in other words it *is* about control. If the Core developers do what they want then they wont sack them.
We must reject this, miners should only be in control of the history of transactions.

There have been altcoins since 2012 at least. Those of us who've been around a while remember when Litecoin was going to become the main crypto. It's just the same thing except BCH instead.

tl;dr That limit is required for bitcoin to be decentralized. Bitcoin's long term survival requires that full nodes are easy and cheap to run, the block size limit puts a limit on how quickly resource usage for nodes goes up. Bitcoin's long term survival also requires that mining be decentralized, the block size limit means blocks can propagate across the network quickly otherwise large miners would have a disproportionate advantage.

Nope, because even some ordinary users might want to fully validate. They want to know they're dealing with real bitcoins not some fake.
We saw in the scalability drama that businesses as a whole were not too concerned with advocating for the BIP148 UASF, it was actually ordinary users with full node wallets who pushed the whole thing through.


We're long past that point now. Mining relies on the centralized FIBRE network because blocks are already too big. Despite that the economy has conceded all possible block size increase compromises. The soft limit default was raised prematurely, and now even segwit with a block size increase to 2-3 MB. China looks like it could ban bitcoin on a protocol level and we've still got people on reddit trying to raise the resource usage of nodes and miners, it's astonishing really.


They encourage miners to be physically close to one another to reduce latency, and possibly be owned by the same entity. The worst kind of centralization.

The merkle tree is only there if the transaction has confirmations, the servers can create an unconfirmed transaction that does anything.
To make it look like it has confirmations the servers just need some hash power (much less than the rest of the miners). The servers can block you from seeing the real hash power and feed you only their fake blocks.
In the recent scalability conflict we saw some miners actually threatening to go for a hard fork attempt. In any future conflict a possibility would be miners spinning up lots of their own Electrum server sybil nodes and maybe DDOSing the honest servers. [We can expect such a conflict]( [^reddit ^comments]( so I want to be prepared and to have full node wallets in the hands of as many people as possible. Centralized Electrum servers are a vulnerability and I don't think I'm exaggerating too much what they can do.
Electrum Personal Server makes sense if you want to use Electrum wallet and also want to have full node verification. Hardware wallets are one part of that, I just mentioned them because I know they're popular. As well as verification, having your own server is much better for privacy, the public Electrum servers can see everything you do.

Even so, the Core developers as a whole were against the BIP148 UASF.

From the Core developer [meeting on 25th May 2017]( sipa (Pieter Wuille), bluematt (Matt Collado), morcos (Alex Morcos), wumpus (Wladimir J. van der Laan), jtimon (Jorge Timón), gmaxwell (Greg Maxwell) DO NOT support bip148.

The fact that BIP148 still happened despite such opposition is a good thing. It proves beyond doubt that developers DO NOT have control over bitcoin. It makes them safer and makes bitcoin safer. An adversary knows they can't control bitcoin by controlling the Core developers. Bitcoin's rules are controlled by its users, and that's how it should be.

The important thing is how much validation is done when you receive a payment.
How it's meant to work is that users give value to bitcoin by being willing to trade real goods or services in return for bitcoins. Full node wallets provide security because if someone tries to pay with a fake bitcoin then that transaction will be rejected and they won't get any real good or service for it.
So it's not storing bitcoins in the wallet that's important, but validating incoming transactions. You could import your addresses as watch-only and that would work.
Another way people contribute is by running archival full nodes to upload the blockchain to other nodes, like being seeders in a torrent. That is more about contributing bandwidth rather than security to bitcoin.

See  to reduce bandwidth usage. You can set listen=0 or blocksonly=1 to reduce the bandwidth usage to very low.
You could also enable pruning to save on disk space, then you won't use much more than about 2GB.
At the start you need to synchronize to the blockchain, which requires downloading the blockchain (about 150gb) and verifying it. Just leave it on overnight. That uses a lot of bandwidth and CPU time, but you only need to do it once and after that the node can keep up with the network without too many resources used.

This introduces a security vulnerability. It then becomes much easier to attack them by partitioning someone away from the network. If this adjustment was added then with only a little bit of hashpower you could wait for their difficulty to drop and then feed them your own fake blocks and steal from them. Once they rejoin the real bitcoin network all those transactions will disappear.
That's why the difficulty adjustment window is so long. The way to avoid the problem of internet in China shutting down is to actually have decentralized mining.

The hubs would have to own lots of bitcoin (maybe 10-20 block rewards, so about 125-500 bitcoins).

The summary is that larger blocks make full nodes more expensive, they make mining more centralized and they take away the incentive to mine the chain forward after inflation goes to zero.
In answer to the questions in your OP. It's not just disk space (full node operators can enable pruning anyway) but also bandwidth, CPU and the time for initial blockchain synchronization. Two separate 1MB blocks take 20 minutes on average to be mined while one 2MB block would take 10 minutes.

I've skimmed over those four articles. They seem broadly accurate.
A few points:
1. The MtGox exchange no longer exists. Localbitcoins.com is still alive and well.
2. Don't use blockchain.info's online wallet. Online wallets can see all your transactions and possibly steal your coins. I'd recommend the Electrum wallet.
3. blockchain.info's shared send mixing service doesn't work. Use something else.
4. The section 'Verifying the Bitcoins have been mixed properly' is oversimplified. Tracing bitcoin is a far more nuanced topic. This is a reasonable article too

You're absolutely right, 153GB is actually not very much for ALL the bitcoins.
And you don't even need to store it all. 153GB is the size of the entire history, but a full node wallet only needs to store all the *unspent* coins, which is much smaller (about 2GB). If you enable pruning in your node then it will delete all the historical blocks and the disk space usage won't be much more than about 2.5GB.
Miners don't search for the data, they also just keep the unspent coins. When a new block comes in they remove the spent coins and add new unspent coins to the database.

If your node has been switched off then it won't know about new bitcoin blocks of transactions. Once it's been switched on again it will download the new blocks until it gets to the chain tip. Each block is about 1-2MB and is created every 10 minutes on average.
So if your node has been switched off for a day it will download ~144MB, for a week it's ~1008MB and a month its ~4320MB. Also all those blocks have to be verified which requires some CPU time too, which can be the bottleneck if you have a particularly fast connection and slow CPU.

Try clicking on those output addresses to move forward to other transactions. They are also all coinjoins. Suppose you knew who owned `1LHUXoVF3L75wdrqmdLaCFfSrLLUwfWMbF` and wanted to find out what happened to the coins. You'd have little hope of doing so.

Linking a hardware wallet with Electrum does not reduce the security of the coins.
Electrum only helps you view the transaction history and create transactions which the hardware wallet signs. The private keys still remain on the hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:37:31


If the miners created hundreds or thousands of their own fake full nodes ([as has happened before]( then this problem would be avoided.
SPV security means fully trusting the miners. Then the miners could inflate forever, steal bitcoins without knowing the privkey and spend a bitcoin twice. That's not what we want.

You can import more than one Electrum wallet (master public keys) into EPS.
For example; a hot wallet, a hardware wallet integration and a multisignature wallet can all be watched by EPS at once. Then Electrum can switch between them easily. Generally these wallets would be your own wallets, otherwise you won't know the master public keys.
But yes as you say, if you want to add more master public keys afterwards and if they have historical transactions then you need to rescan.

The universe doesn't care what people think *should* happen, so going around saying *"But it SHOULDNT BE THIS WAY"* is pointless. It **is** this way. Bitcoin *requires* most of the economy to use full nodes.

Is this different from on-chain transactions? With the blockchain you also cant tell whether somebody has associated a bitcoin address with your identity.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:08:44
Mostly true, but missed the ASICBOOST patent as being the real reason bcash was supported by one large miner. Read this: 
The first update that bcash developers did was remove all the code that broke ASICBOOST.
We prefer to call the altcoin created "bcash" instead of "bitcoin cash" because we perceive the latter as trying to steal bitcoin's name. BCash is much less confusing to newbs as well, many have made a mistake when trading and bought the wrong cryptocurrency.
Another problem is lightning is mischaracterized by talking about ICOs. There's no owing or counterparty risk in the lightning protocol. A better analogy might be a caching layer for transactions before they go on the blockchain.
The UASF movement is also missed out and I think it's very interesting. The miners were blocking segwit and UASF was a way to activate segwit regardless of what the miners did. It required building support from bitcoin users and businesses and it activated on 1st August 2017 which was the reason why the altcoin BCash created then. It was a final tantrum by some miners when they realized that UASF forced their hand.
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:07:09


Miners do not control bitcoin's validity rules, they control the history of transactions.
Take the example of the UASF, all the miners massive ASIC farms were overpowered by people using full nodes. Because UASF is a way to change the validity rules which miners have no say over.
If you want to support the true bitcoin, then tell all the people and businesses you trade with that you'll be using a full node wallet and they can only transact with you in real bitcoins. You could also be ready to sell the airdropped B2X coins after they attempt their hard fork, you could even sell them today using the futures markets.
But notice that merely running a full node without doing any transactions has *no effect* on whether B2X succeeds or not. You should ask the Ledger company as one of their customers that you would like them to add a feature of connecting to your own node; You don't want to accidentally get slipped some fake bitcoins.

It was risky. The risks never came to pass but they were risks nonetheless.
At the time there were very real costs. The price of block space had reached 500 sat/b and even higher. A lot of people thought that cost was higher than the risk of UASF.
Also note that the only reason this dispute seems like nothing today is because segwit got added to bitcoin. If we had still be waiting for segwit until August 2018 the dispute wouldn't seem like history at all.

*If bitcoin is digital gold, then a full node is your own personal goldsmith who checks that the gold is actually real.*
For a bitcoin to be real, it must follow all the rules of the bitcoin network. Rules like:
* Nobody ever spent coins without holding the private key.
* Nobody spent the same coins twice.
* Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for miners, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
* Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
Only a full node wallet under your control give you certainty that all these rules of Bitcoin are followed, which therefore checks that your incoming payments are genuine.
Note that your bitcoin wallet must somehow use your full node. It's no good to just run a node on rented hardware somewhere and use a lightweight wallet for bitcoin transactions. Someone could slip you some fake bitcoins because your lightweight wallet doesn't do any verifying.

Well, it might do. It may motivate people to do good. For example the farmer can produce enough crop to feed hundreds of people, he is motivated to do this by the profit he makes by selling his goods.
Honest question, in an anarcho-syndicalist society why would a farmer be motivated to produce more food than they personally need? Farming is boring, difficult, dirty and isolating, there needs to be something quite strong to motivate someone to do this enough to feed a modern industrial society.

Right. What I meant to say was how if miners are centralized more than 50% then they can impose any rule they want, because they have the power to stop any transaction from happening.
So if CJ/CCT becomes a problem for them, they'll just make a rule that you need to reveal the coinjoin-mapping or the CT keys that reveal the amounts before your transaction gets mined into a block.

It means somebody can deal with bitcoin without having to take on the risk that usd/btc will drop while they have to wait.
For example if a merchant has bitcoin tied up in escrow, he might be worried about the value of those bitcoins dropping before escrow is released. He can open a hedge so that he always get the same USD value no matter how long he waits.

The simplest way means open a position where downward movements of usd/btc are cancelled by upward movements of your hedge. So if usd/btc halves the value of your hedge position will double and overall you'll be about equal.
Another way is to use options. Though that's more complicated and I don't think anyone is doing that right now.

Replace-by-fee is incredibly helpful when your tx gets stuck with a low fee. There's plenty of examples of people using it with Eligius pool during those stress tests.

Bitcoin and traditional banks do different things. BTC is more like cash, sent from one person to another without going through a financial institution. If you lose your banknotes they are also gone.
On the downside, traditional banks can deny you service if you have a bad credit rating or no permanent address, depending on the political situation in your country they could freeze your account or stop you withdrawing or transfering. Correctly used, this is never possible with bitcoin.

Many people who already miners have an interest in telling you to not mine, because your miner would be in competition with their's.
It may or may not be possible to turn a profit with mining. Things to check for:
1. Will your mined bitcoin be worth more than the electricity used to power it?
2. Will it take too long to pay off your miner? If the difficulty keeps rising you may find your miner is never paid off.

While I agree with you in not supporting bip101, storage of the blockchain probably wont be a problem.
Bitcoin Core 0.11 had implemented a simple form of blockchain pruning. Now you can run a full node with only ~1gb of disk space.

Pruned nodes *are* full nodes. They are useful to run because unlike SPV nodes they don't have to trust anyone else to verify the rules of bitcoin.

Carrying on with this theme, whats your view on the 2008 bailouts of banks?
You sing the praises of regulation and state-control but that resulted in banks that caused the crisis walking away essentially unscathed. At the same time that many ordinary people were heavily hit. Your imagined anarchy that you attack needs work, but the current system has plenty of things wrong with it too.
For what it's worth I've been trading in the bitcoin economy for years and have never once yet been scammed (touch wood). If anarchy had no value, the current system would not be encouraging free markets and massively benefiting from them. The more anarchistic capitalism advocated by many around here isn't too far from the capitalism we actually live under now.
Part of the point of bitcoin as I see it is to find technical solutions to our political problems, for example [it's in-principle possible to not have fraudulent fractional reserves under bitcoin.]( So your example of the Great Depression runs on banks could be completely solved.
It's easy to talk about theories from the 1920s, how state influence in the economy is very important. But we're in 2015 now. The ideas you draw upon completely failed in 1970s stagflation. Times are changing.

What were you trying to do? Your tx doesn't seem exotic in any way, no multisig/p2sh or anything special.
Not that it's your fault, but in future when creating your own raw transactions, try to use a GUI which explicitly displays the miner fee. I could recommend coinjumble for this. 
Or maybe could add an explicit display (and maybe a warning before broadcasting) to coind.in (not sure how possible this is)
This sadly keeps happening. Bitcoin Core [has a built-in checks]( to make it harder to shoot yourself in the foot like this, but its useless if people use other services like blockchain.info If you search the name of that website on this subreddit you'll see countless threads of their incompetence leading to money loss.

Well BIP101 blocks are valid blocks for now, they only have a version bit changed. So other miners in the p2pool would accept them. In fact you could look at the p2pool sharechain to get an idea of how much mining power is on BIP101.
Yes that sounds right. If a hardfork happens on the main chain then the p2pool sharechain would also hardfork.
NotBitcoinXT is an attack on BitcoinXT. It draws attention to the flawed way of looking for mining power as a guide to economic consensus. Just by existing, it means we'll never be sure beforehand if a contentious hardfork is safe. This is why a hardfork should be done with consensus.

2-of-3 multisig escrow should be very close to trustless.
Choose an arbitrator that both you trust who generates one key pair, each of you also generates a keypair and together you create a 2-of-3 multisig address. You both send 5btc to that address, after the fork you have 10 BTC sent to you and 10 B2X sent to him. You can do that together with both your keys, but if there's some disagreement then the arbitrator can use their key as a tie-breaker. Also since the arbitrator has only one key they cannot steal the coins.
You need to obtain a split UTXO after the fork (i.e a coin that exists only on one chain) and then include that in the transaction so that its only valid on one chain, so that there won't be a replay attack. You can create such a split coin by using nLockTime.

Right, but I understood in p2pool every miner runs their own bitcoin node. It could've been the individual miner found a share which happened to match the real difficulty and their XT bit in the header remained. It doesn't imply that all miners in p2pool are mining with XT.

I never used mainnet DarkWallet, but if that's true then wow. Yeah a problem with the darkwallet incentives was that you had no reason to wait around. If you wanted a coinjoin you might as well create one straight away, so there'd be a shortage of people who want to wait to mix.
JoinMarket solves this by the waiting party being allowed to ask for a fee. It gives them an incentive to wait around and provide liquidity. Which means if you wanted to coinjoin you can do it straight away without any waiting at all.
This website shows information about which people are waiting around for coinjoin.  Right now you can coinjoin immediately for just 0.0001% depending on the amount.

Both are hardforks, both are important rules that give bitcoin long-term value, both do not have consensus to change.
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:24:02
It's starting to sound a lot like *"We must do something, This is something, Therefore, we must do this."* style reasoning. I actually agree the block size should be changed.
Let turn this around, bip101 proposes eventually 8GB blocks (that gigabytes with a G), do you really believe that won't lead to incredible centralization of mining and full nodes?
The DDOS thing is trivially fixable. Full nodes can instead store their mempool transactions on disk or just drop them. In fact the latest Bitcoin Core [has a feature for dropping certain transactions to deal with flooding](
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:17:34
Well they coded up BitcoinXT in what many interpreted as a hostile hardfork attempt on the bitcoin consensus. Imagine if a small group of core developers attempted the same thing with the 21million supply limit? It would ruffle a few feathers.
Given those hostile actions, as well as Mike Hearn's well-known "*Benevolent dictatorship over consensus*" view, I think it's pretty clear why they did not sign. (edit: assuming they were asked, I hope they were)
Which is a shame. Bitcoin works by consensus. We should continue to extend olive branches and handshakes to everyone so bitcoin can progress by consensus and agreement instead of war.
@_date: 2015-09-21 09:46:45
It's possible but you have little privacy and no way to detect if bitcoin's rules are being broken. (Meaning miners could inflate past the 21m limit, lie to you about coins being unspent and a number of other things)
SPV suits the needs of many people but they depend on there being many other full nodes to enforce the rules.

You would not be waiting in IKEA.
It's a bit like a cheque clearing, yes you can wait 6 months so there's no possibility of a chargeback but honestly nobody does. In almost all real-life commerce, people do not bother waiting for the chargeback window to close.
For some very large transactions, like a real estate sale, you do indeed wait for the chargeback window of time to close. See this example where the UK central bank payment system was held up for a few hours. 
On the other hand, there's several payment systems which also have instant transactions so thats you're sole reason for using bitcoin you'd be better off looking elsewhere.

You're right, some of the surplus value goes to capital. But according to Marx, capital is dead labour, meaning at some point in the past a labourer had to consume less than they produced and so they built up savings. They invested them and so that became capital.
So actually surplus value already goes to labour, some of it goes to living labour (workers) and some to dead labour (capital). Both are required to get a job done.

Large blocks take longer to upload, if they are too large it gives miners a huge incentive to be physically close to each other. If the trend continues then all the mining power ends up in one physical location, to be easily switched off or controlled by a single entity.
Larger blocks increase the bandwidth requirement for miners, ultimately mining being low-bandwidth is one of the best defenses bitcoin has against being controlled. petertodd writes:

Could you try a child-pays-for-parent to make your tx confirm faster?
Let me explain. Say cex.io is paying you to your address, even though the cex.io transaction is not confirmed you can create a new transaction that spends it with a high enough fee paying to another address of yours. Child-pays-for-parent means that this new transaction with a high-enough fee will incentivize the miners to mine both transactions.
Post here if you need help doing this, it may be somewhat tricky. (This stress test should remind wallet developers to make it slightly easier)

Me and a few others have been working on JoinMarket. It's an implementation of CoinJoin where the incentives correctly line up. It works today and many people are using it.
The idea behind JoinMarket is that holders of bitcoin will allow their coins to be mixed with in return for a fee. The mixing will happen in coinjoin transactions. They form a kind of smart contract which means your private keys will never leave your computer so there is no risk of loss (barring malware or bug*)
Put simply, JoinMarket allows you to improve the privacy of your bitcoin transactions for low fees in a decentralized fashion Because of the fee paid, owners of bitcoin will be able to earn an income using JoinMarket.
 There is also a subreddit It's written in python and we would very much appreciate help. Even if you only test pull requests and write messages that everything worked.

SPV nodes only download the transaction information about addresses they're interested in, so their peers can figure out which addresses belong to them.
Full nodes download all the transaction data on their hard drive (delete most of it if pruning is enabled) and therefore no-one in the p2p network can find which addresses are theirs.

Many bitcoin users don't want to be spied on. The whole idea won't work if your competitors, customers, employers or landlords can see a complete log of every transaction you make.
Also it's a systemic risk. For bitcoin to work as a kind of money, it has to be fungible (meaning every bitcoin must be the same as every other) and liquid (meaning its easy to trade with it, for example without having to use the services of these companies)
Coinalytics and similar firms would break this by tracking every single bitcoin in the entire blockchain history. Eventually people would stop using bitcoin when they find their money is worthless because 10 transactions ago it was used for something illegal in some country.

Depends on the kind of regulation. Bank bailouts were government regulation after all. It's way too simplistic to say *anarchy bad, regulation good*.

Why do you believe this? It's not correct. Old nodes see segwit transactions as OP_TRUE in the scriptSig. All their own transactions are not segwit because they haven't updated, so their scriptSig is the same as it was before.

"what do you have to hide?", there are actually plenty of legitimate reasons for privacy.

Digital goldbugs should ask themselves: if writing blog posts and lobbying mining pools is enough to change bitcoin's core rules with a hardfork, are rules like the 21million limit safe? With the falling bip101 block count and other metrics, we can see the answer is probably not.
BitcoinXT advocates should understand that Core advocates see their movement as a hostile hardfork to change an important consensus rule.

This is the right way.
Monero and all the other altcoins only have a small amount of users. If you use bitcoin there's probably 500k users (nobody really knows) who could be confused with you, if you use an altcoin there'll be far less people to provide you cover.
If you trade into and out of bitcoin with anonymous methods like cash-in-person you could skip all the privacy tech. If you use JoinMarket you could sell them at Coinbase.com and if challenged say you were an early miner/investor who got them cheap.

Much of the crime is a result of bad security by banks. Decades old technology like magnetic strips, PIN numbers that never change, you giving your account information, and trust the people with the information to dip their hands into your account and take only what they're supposed to, ATM skimmers can copy your card without your knowledge.
Here's a doozy and way more effort than a skimmer: There are entire fake ATMs! You walk up to it, put your card into the slot, give it your PIN, and it says something like, "Cannot connect to bank network. Sorry for the inconvenience. Try again later." It's not connected to a bank. It copied your card and your PIN.
Since you didn't actually finish your transaction, you don't think about it. You go on about your day, still looking for where to use your card.
The system needs to change.

Other node software I know of is: btcd, bitcoinfs, libbitcoin, toshi, Bitcoin Knots, bitcoind-with-addrindex and petertodd's full-RBF fork.
Storage is easy, the major problem is bandwidth, especially for the initial blockchain synchronization. At 1MB per block, the blockchain grows by 52GB per year. If you doubled that to 2MB as Bitcoin "Classic" is proposing, the growth rate becomes 104GB per year. All of that must be downloaded by any new full node.
To aid in user's choices, would you consider putting up a notice informing users that using the clients BitcoinXT / Classic / Unlimited could result in them hard forking off the blockchain and possibly resulting in their coins becoming altcoins unrelated to the main bitcoin blockchain. It's a very serious consequence and well worth informing users about.

Flooding the forums, [brigading]( using [reddit sockpuppets]( lying and [automated downvoting]( are just a few of the ways the hard forker side has been attacking bitcoin.
Your mastermind Mike Hearn who started all this fuss proclaimed himself the new dictator of the bitcoin code. He then left to work for the banks and wrote a New York Times articles saying that bitcoin will fail.
You don't care about the things that make bitcoin valuable, it's decentralization of full nodes and miners. All you care about is low fees on-chain to create a payment network, a shitty version of paypal. You want to put miners in control of everything, allowing them to steal coins or print infinite amounts of them.
It may be interesting to you but it's not bitcoin.

Yes indeed, especially when one takeaway from the conference was the shortage of relevant developer skills in the bitcoin space.
@_date: 2016-10-12 18:02:46
If every miner begins creating blocks that the bitcoin economy rejects, then those miners won't be able to sell their block rewards to anyone. In effect they will be mining fool's gold.
So in effect it's the bitcoin economy controlling the miners, because that is what gives value to the bitcoin tokens that miners receive as income.
That's also what protects the 21 million limit and 1MB limit. If a miner breaks these rules and the economy disagrees then they are simply not mining bitcoin.
I really recommend you read this post carefully because it succintly describes how miners and economic full nodes relate to each other in bitcoin: 
@_date: 2016-10-20 13:44:24


The same thread also has this:


Also from his whitepaper:


Now we know that miners won't be able to fund themselves from fees to stay decentralized unless block sizes have an upper limit, otherwise there's no marginal cost of including another transaction and the market rate for fees goes to zero or very low.
Even though Satoshi put the block size limit in and agreed with its use to keep bitcoin decentralized, we shouldn't use on argument from authority. Satoshi is not our Jesus and the whitepaper is not our bible. We build bitcoin in this way because it works, not because some long-gone forum nick said so.

A bigger growth in the blockchain size means the initial blockchain synchronization takes longer and longer. It's one of the main reasons cited when asking why more people don't use full nodes.
1MB per block implies 52GB growth per year. All of which must be downloaded and verified when a node synchronized to the network.
I've got a strong imperssion that the hard forker side doesn't care about any of this. Mike Hearn has sold you a future where bitcoin is run from a small number of datacenters that everybody else must trust, which would then be in complete control of the currency.

People from the pro-Core side spoke out against those attacks: 
I've never seen any similar condemnation from the hard forker side for all the crap they do. Plus given that Mike Hearn was the leader of your movement, he can hardly be called a small extremist minority.


Where you say censorship, I say moderation. Your side still had it's own forums, subreddits and twitter. It was always able to have its ideas and message heard.
The point of bitcoin isn't to have a united community but to be a decentralized digital currency. Like theymos said, if 90% of reddit users disagree with that view then he wants those 90% to leave. If I was in theymos' place I would've done exactly the same thing, and I can commend him for staying firm against all the disgusting ad hominem attacks and doxing that he had to endure.


Well you pretty much re-stated what I wrote. You want bitcoin to be a low-cost payment network and you care much less about the digital gold aspect. Your plan of having every coffee purchase on the blockchain would be the death of a decentralized bitcoin.
If you're worried about 'artificial scarcity' note that bitcoin itself is entirely artificial. The 21m limit and 10 minute block interval are just as arbitrary as the 1mb block size.


If you in a dictionary for what "settlement" means, you'll see bitcoin is already a settlement network. The p2p cash aspect means you can simply give it to another person and that transaction is irreversible. You never need to talk to the other again because the transaction is settled.
What's more, it's been known since Satoshi's time that bitcoin would be a settlement network:

To spend from this `1111111111111111111114oLvT2` address you need to know its private key. Usually people know a private key of an address because they started with the private key and then calculated the address from it. Kept the private key a secret and sent the address to whoever they wanted to pay them.
That particular address has a pubkeyhash of all zeros, what happened was that someone typed lots of zeros and then converted them to the base58 bitcoin address format. There's no way they or anyone else knows what the corresponding private key is.

Be careful you don't fall into the Dunning–Kruger trap, bitcoin privacy and fungibility is *not* solved which is why there's so much research into it.
I think Tor is widely misunderstood for bitcoin privacy. For example people will often connect their Electrum wallet to an Electrum server over tor, thinking it's important. When in reality the Electrum server can still trivially link together all the user's bitcoin addresses and therefore see everything they do in bitcoin.

Financial privacy isn't just for shady thieves and drug dealers, it's for everyoen. The bad guys can pass their ill-gotten gains through a few cash-intensive businesses for a 50% cut. It's a just cost of their (often lucrative) business.
Cheap, practical, realistic privacy is for normal people.

* You wouldn't want your competitors analyzing your business' spending and learning trade secrets.
In it's current form, bitcoin is unacceptable to many potential legitimate users because of the privacy issues. 


The MtGox hacker has probably already sold his bitcoins. When you use JoinMarket to mix you are probably mixing with investors of bitcoins who would own them anyway and have put them into the JoinMarket bot to earn an income from them.

Large blocks take longer to upload, if they are too large it gives miners a huge incentive to be physically close to each other. If the trend continues then all the mining power ends up in one physical location, to be easily switched off or controlled by a single entity.
Larger blocks increase the bandwidth requirement for miners, ultimately mining being low-bandwidth is one of the best defenses bitcoin has against being controlled. writes:

Lol. Daesh jr, yes because fixing bitcoin, enabling LN and teaching centralized miners a lesson is exactly the same as the horrible things ISIS / Daesh did in Syria.
What actually happened is one large miner didn't want to activate segwit because it would destroy one of their secret patented ASICBOOST optimizations, they stirred up useful idiots in the community to block the segwit upgrade for 9 months. Bitcoin users wouldn't stand for that and organized themselves to activate the segwit rules without the miners. Miners quickly fell into line without a fight, because that's how bitcoin works on a technical level.
You failed to understand what people want from bitcoin. They want a digital currency that has a low requirement for trust, not a Paypal 2.0.

Funny that, they don't seem to back themselves when given the chance to vote with their wallets.
When someone came up with a way to trade btc-core coins with btc-bip101 coins, a couple of people put up offers to trade bip101/core but no offers for the other way.
So either bip101 supporters don't hold many bitcoins or they actually don't believe in bip101 that much.

An often-forgotten-about alternative to hardware wallets is multisig wallets.
They work by creating a wallet that needs N-of-M private keys to spend the money. So you can divide up your private keys among several computers, laptops, smartphones and paper backups. And assume that it's very unlikely that malware will infect all those at once.
Electrum bitcoin wallet has this feature:  Armory wallet also does it.
Multisig wallets are essentially free, it only requires you to download open-source software from the internet. They could be seen as slightly easier to trust because they are only software, which more people can read the source of than study the electronics of a hardware wallet.

Well bitcoin means different things to different people.
The reason bitcoin is valuable is because its decentralized and trustless with all that this implies (censorship resistance, known inflation schedule, etc)
You can build other transaction layers on top of the bitcoin blockchain. Like lightning which actually could provide cheap, instant, permissionless transactions.
It makes no sense at all for every coffee purchase and online tip to be broadcast through the entire network and stored on the blockchain forever. Bitcoin is SWIFT, not starbucks points.

*"Around the world blocks are being watched nerviously as they tick along every 10 minutes. There's something wrong. Not enough mining pools are signalling. A damaging chain split looks certain. The price tumbles. Shorters rejoice. Down 30% in just a few days. Tens of millions of dollars wiped off the value of bitcoin. The forums are in panic, this drop is only the beginning, their worst nightmares look ever more likely. In their backrooms the big miners exchange worried looks, concerned about their future income stream. But in the next few hours it becomes clear that the last major mining pools have switched over. It is confirmed as more and more blocks come in. Looks like bitcoin won't be torn apart after all. The price recovers, slowly at first but then shooting up higher than it's ever been before. The UASF plan worked! Segwit is ours!"*
1st August 2018 marks exactly one year since the activation of the segwit UASF (user activated soft fork). An extremely important event in bitcoin's history.
Segregated Witness (segwit) is an update to bitcoin that fixes one of bitcoin's long-standing bugs and makes off-chain contracts possible. It is necessary to make Lightning Network work on bitcoin.
Segwit was scheduled to be added to bitcoin as a soft fork, but bitcoin's enemies started spreading lies about it. Lies like "miners can steal bitcoins stored on segwit addresses", "segwit is too complicated" and "segwit goes against Satoshi's vision".  Some large mining pools used these convenient excuses to stop segwit from happening. In reality there were secret agendas at play, such as [the realization that Lightning Network would make coin tracking startups ineffective]( and [the patented covert miner attack ASICBOOST](
User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) is a way to activate soft forks like segwit even if the miners are blocking it. This works because bitcoin's consensus rules are enforced by users who use full node wallets, not by miners. The BIP148 proposal was made to do this with the activation date: 1st August 2017. In the weeks leading up to that date there was lively debate on all the forums, and supporters of the idea including some bitcoin business ran the BIP148 client software as their full node wallet.
This was all risky. If some miners had still refused to back segwit it could have led to a damaging chain-split. For this reason UASF is sometimes controversial to this day. But in that atmosphere of cripplingly-high miner fees, lots of people took the view that the risks were worth it.
In the end the UASF was successful. Miners actually got together to create a plan called BIP91 where they would activate segwit slightly ahead of the 1st August deadline. With segwit added to bitcoin, the mining group Bitmain who were opposed to segwit created an altcoin called bcash which didnt have segwit and which was fraudulently marketed as "the real bitcoin".
In the year since segwit activation, [Lightning Network]( implementations have been released on mainnet. They are regularly used to send payments that are much more private, are instant, ridiculously cheap and do not burden the full nodes or miners that are essential to bitcoin's decentralization. A true revolution that makes entirely new applications possible, such as [satoshi's place](

Maybe the 78 who connected to you haven't made any new transactions for you to relay? It wouldn't surprise me, many people have a misconception that bitcoin is like bittorrent and that upload capcity is the only and most important resource. The 78 might all be Raspberry Pi nodes that do nothing but upload.
There are lots of other reasons to run a node apart from uploading the blockchain to others. The most important one is trustlessness. Running a node and using it as a wallet is the only way you can be sure that no extra inflation has happened, no coin was spent without the private key being known, and all the other bitcoin rules (e.g. difficulty) are being followed.
The next great reason to run your own node is privacy. Having downloaded the entire blockchain is the most private method of using bitcoin. All other wallets involves allowing a third party server to spy on you, who could tell which addresses are yours, link addresses together and maybe find your IP address too if you're not using tor.
BTW, I run two full nodes but use -listen=0 because I can't spare the bandwidth. They are used as wallets and do many transactions per day. I thank people like you for uploading blocks to me when I started.

They probably spend too much resources self-promoting and too little actually programming.

That's a weaker security model. It would mean the miners can do what they like with the UTXO set including printing more bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:50:13
Not really. If someone spends the same coin over and over they'll use up far more storage space than if they just make one single transaction.
Also one single transaction does far less to bid up the required miner fee.
@_date: 2016-10-20 10:54:33

This is one of the things Satoshi got wrong.
If only specialists run nodes, the miners can print infinite bitcoins, steal anybody's bitcoin or spend the same coins twice.
@_date: 2016-10-13 22:49:51
The "majority decision making" there refers to the miners choosing the ordering of transactions. If you read the context of that quote you'll see Satoshi is talking about creating a distributed timestamp server using proof of work.
But stepping back a bit, Satoshi is not our Jesus and the whitepaper is not our bible.
There are some things Satoshi got wrong, like quadratic scaling for signature validation, not using public key derivation from signatures. He also didn't realise the incentive structure that without most of the economy using full nodes, bitcoin miners have an incentive to print infinite bitcoins or steal other people's bitcoins.

If anything we should be going for longer block intervals. Because the important thing for miner centralization is latency, not block size. Increasing the interval gives us more latency to play with.
I can see one day there being a compromise limit change where the base block size is increased to 12mb and the block interval increased to 1 hour. (This is a 2x on-chain capacity increase) That would allow mining through tor, and not just that but through a slow dial-up connection in Kazakhstan over tor. For maximum miner decentralization.
Yes that would result in slower confirmations, but eventually everyone will be using off-chain tech for everything where payments can be very fast.

The mining pool data comes from strings that pools insert into blocks, which some pools don't even do, plus they could lie about it.
The block data comes from miners signaling that they support a certain version. Again they could be lying, in the BIP66 soft fork it turned out miners were lying about their verification of strict DER signatures.

I can appreciate your points. But I hope my OP educates users on the tradeoffs involved with using a trusted third party. At least now if they believe it's worth it for them, they'll go through the motions of reading the documentation and understanding the API to use in their store.


This should never be necessary. Backend code would add a new address to the watch-only list, or just use the `getnewaddress` RPC. I don't see where querying any arbitrary address on the blockchain would be useful for an online store.


I understand there was a slowness issue prior to versions 0.12.x of Core. I believe it's fixed now, but more reports from users is always useful to developers. The crashing would be a serious bug and should be definitely reported to the developers.

If you can guarantee the address is new and unused, you can import it as watch-only with the rescan flag set false.

This is probably the best solution right now.
However stealth addresses have a few downsides: They either require you to store the entire transaction index on disk, or you have to outsource the searching to a third party who can completely ruin your privacy. There are ideas for non-outsourcable addresses.

Since summer 2015 when they started, the price has more than doubled, development continues and the user base has gone up. Volatility is down, market depth is up. Because of the block size conflict, people are far more informed at how bitcoin works on a technical level.
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:26:57
Fungibility means that every monetary unit is equal. Companies that spy on bitcoin users could result in a situation where not every bitcoin is treated equally, where some coins (linked to illegal activities say) trade at a discount compared to other coins.

The bitcoin community on reddit has had something of a schism related to the value of a constant in the source code called MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.
It comes down to two different visions of what bitcoin should be. One side wants bitcoin to be something like a digital gold which focuses on the decentralized currency aspect. The other side wants bitcoin to be a high-volume payment method a bit like the Visa card network with much less emphasis on the currency aspect.
The bitcoin-as-digital-gold view is strong in r/bitcoin, the bitcoin-as-high-volume-payment-network is strong in r/btc. Both subreddits have fairly strong moderation and heavily downvote the other side, that's how escalated the tensions are.

I think a major point you're missing is that bitcoin can't scale on the blockchain. There is an inherent tradeoff between scale and decentralization. The reason is that on a blockchain when A and B make a transaction, all the peers in the network must hear about it, so the resource usage goes as O( N^2 )
Have you seen these graphs?  They show the distribution of random times between a block being found. Here are some facts:
* 34% of all blocks take longer than 10 minutes to be generated.
* 5% of all blocks take longer than 30 minutes.
* 0.3% take 60 minutes or more (which happens about once every 2 days)
So it's irrelevant where you "believe in" cheap and instant onchain transactions, because those are simply not possible on a technical level. Transactions are not instant, if you're unlucky they can take one hour to confirm just by random chance.
Luckily there IS technology that can do cheap and instant bitcoin transactions. It works by using smart contracts to route payments instead of flooding them to every peer. It cuts right through the heart of the scale/decentralization tradeoff. It is a set of hash-locked bidirectional payment, also known as Lightning Network. It is capable of fulfilling your desire for instant, cheap transactions.
So to answer your second question:


The point of a low-volume blockchain is to be decentralized and to have monetary autonomy. That way high-volume secure payment networks can be built on top, as well as keeping all the benefits that monetary autonomy brings.

That's not true. There's plenty of other reasons to run a node other than to upload the blockchain to new nodes.
The most important one is trustlessness. Running a node and using it as a wallet is the only way you can be sure that no extra inflation has happened, no coin was spent without the private key being known, and all the other bitcoin rules (e.g. difficulty) are being followed.
The next great reason to run your own node is privacy. Having downloaded the entire blockchain is the most private method of using bitcoin. All other wallets involves allowing a third party server to spy on you, who could tell which addresses are yours, link addresses together and maybe find your IP address too if you're not using tor.

Gold ETFs would never accept gold bars without carefully verifying that they are genuine. A bank would never accept banknotes without carefully checking their holograms, watermarks, microlettering and other security features. A bitcoin ETF should do the same level of verification.
In practice I imagine the ETF's bitcoins would be tracked with a watch-only wallet running on a full node, and all investor information about them would come from it.

The worst that will happen is people will have to pay slightly more in miner fees.

(The real reason this issue is being constantly brought up)
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:06:16
Here is why we should be careful with simply raising the block size.
Large blocks take longer to upload, if they are too large it gives miners a huge incentive to be physically close to each other. If the trend continues then all the mining power ends up in one physical location, to be easily switched off or controlled by a single entity.
Larger blocks increase the bandwidth requirement for miners, ultimately mining being low-bandwidth is one of the best defenses bitcoin has against being controlled. petertodd writes:






The big-block proposal, bip101, eventually gets to 8GB blocks (that gigabytes with a G), this will lead to incredible centralization of mining and full nodes. Bitcoin has value because it's a decentralized currency.

Top respect goes to the developers who coded segwit. Secondary respect to the community who made UASF happen.


Stop trying to rewrite history. Antpool was blocking segwit, [they said so themselves.](
"When asked specifically whether Antpool would run SegWit code without a hard fork increase in the block size also included in a release of Bitcoin Core, Wu responded: “No. It is acceptable that the hard fork code is not activated, but it needs to be included in a ‘release’ of Bitcoin Core. I have made it clear about the definition of ‘release,’ which is not ‘public.’”"
i.e. They will block segwit until a hard fork version of Bitcoin Core is released. (That's what they said until the UASF movement sent them packing)


There's no need to be upset... just get with the program already. Decentralized Bitcoin is awesome and doesn't bow even to warehouses full of ASICs.

Wouldn't that mean you can't trade with anyone because everyone has a different idea of what bitcoin's rules are?
There are actually many other bitcoin nodes such as btcd, bitcoinfs, libbitcoin, bitcoin knots, bitcoind-with-addrindex.
The difference with them is they don't attempt to hard fork the blockchain to create a new currency. BitcoinXT, Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited do, which is why we say they are hostile hard fork attempts that would result in an altcoin.

Miners obviously don't give a shit, they're happy to sit back and collect their miners fees while great scalability updates like Segwit, LN and Schnorr signatures are blocked.

Good post, but it should be pointed out that you should use a full node backend with your hardware wallet.
To be secure you need more than private keys, you need to validate too.
Admit it, most of you are using Trezor's web wallet.
Not to mention the web wallet means Trezor can see what all your bitcoin address are, ruining your privacy.
edit: From what I see the easiest way to actually do this is to connect your hardware device to Electrum wallet, and point Electrum to your own server. You can use [Electrum Personal Server]( or [ElectrumX]( which both have different attributes and tradeoffs.

Not really. Altcoins have far worse fundamentals because nobody actually uses them for commerce. Bitcoin has full blocks and people willing to pay lots to get their transactions included. Altcoins have empty blocks that nobody even bothers to fill with spam.
Last time in 2013 altcoins rallied too. Litecoin, dogecoin, peercoin, quark and a bunch of other all saw gains before crashing even harder afterwards. Low liquidity meant people couldn't even sell a few thousand $ without slippage.

Good. That's how it should be. 75% of bitcoins that will ever exist have already been mined.

If a wide variety of people can't run nodes then bitcoin is not decentralized. If bitcoin isn't decentralized then miners can print money, spend bitcoins not belonging to them, claw back payments or break other rules (about difficulty etc)
A bitcoin without decentralization is not usable.
As for this newb with a transaction that takes long to confirm, they'll just have to increase the miner fee they pay. Sorry but VC-backed startups who want to use the blockchain as their personal storage server are not the priority here, they're the ones pushing this.

@_date: 2015-11-04 13:02:06
Yes, fundamentally that's the disagreement. Here is why the cheap-global-payment-network side is wrong:
Cheap global payment networks can be built on top of settlement layers. Like how Visa is built on top of SWIFT. The other way around is not possible.
Also an advantage of a payment channel on top of the blockchain is *instant confirmations*, no need to wait for a block confirmation like with on-chain transactions.
It makes absolutely no sense for every coffee purchase and online tip to be broadcast to all nodes on the network. The blockchain being a settlement layer is the only way this can work in the long run. Bitcoin's main advantage and the reason it's interesting is that it's decentralized uncensorable money.
@_date: 2015-11-08 15:06:29
* Anti-censorship properties. This includes the possibility to use bitcoin privately, because being punished after the fact is still a method of censorship.
* Programmable properties. This is sometimes overlooked. Bitcoin can be controlled with software. So for example on localbitcoins when you click the button *Release Escrow*, the seller immediately gets their bitcoins, while for bank accounts and similar you normally need to phone up a lawyer who will then release escrow within the next few hours. Lawyers are more expensive and slower than software for this.
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:35:53
Miners collectively controlling the money supply sounds like it will result in inflation forever. You write "no transaction fees anymore" but mining can never be free. Your proposal just shifts the costs of mining from transactors to investors.

There's no stealth address implementation that's without problems, so a lot of people are holding off from implementing it until the idea is sorted out. Also some policy modifications may need to be rolled out first (e.g. multi-push OP_RETURN, which is the default in Bitcoin Core 0.12 so is probably already widespread)
Also getting a new address type adopted is hard as hell, having all wallets adopt p2sh in 2012 took a long time.

Not at all. Hashpower closely follows price, so as long as the UASFchain has a higher price than nonUASFchain (which is true by definition if the economy majority supports it) then the UASFchain will get more work. Also the fact that the nonUASFchain can be wiped out puts a further damper on it's price (because it's more risky to hold)
Refer to my mailing list email about this a few weeks ago: 
The BIP66 soft fork accidentally caused a chain split, and it was fine because the economic majority was backing the BIP66 chain. The only loss was incurred by the miners who mined the invalid blocks.
As someone described it earlier, the best case scenario to a HF is the worst case to a UASF.

ToTheMoonGuy, I notice you're using keybase.io
You should be aware that their service bloats the UTXO set because they send to unspendable addresses instead of using OP_RETURN, ultimately this is bad for bitcoin and would eventually harm decentralization.

CoinJoin doesn't directly deal with IP-address based attacks.
However, because CoinJoin has multiple people, the final fully-signed transaction could be broadcast by *any* of them. This passive-monitoring sybil does not know that the different IP addresses are co-operating to create a CoinJoin.
In my CoinJoin project, called JoinMarket, I've opened an issue for adding this feature.

You ask me for qualification but make your own outstanding claims without evidence like *"Bitcoin has absolutely zero real-world adoption right now."*.
An often-missed fundamental metric is the price for block space, currently at 260 satoshi-per-byte for confirmation within 1 block. If you put it into perspective that's a very high number, I remember when 1 sat/byte could easily get you the same. The price of block space has gone up by more than two orders of magnitude **and people are still paying it**. This is a market signal that is very expensive to fake.
It means people's marginal utility of using bitcoin is at least that much. It's one of the strongest evidence that bitcoin is used for something beyond speculation. By contrast Ethereum's, Monero's and Litecoin's blocks are near empty. It would be very cheap to fill them up with spam but nobody even bothers.
So there must be SOME users of bitcoin, you just haven't found them (I suspect you haven't been looking in the right places, of course you won't find coffee purchases in bitcoin)
* Bitrefill is a service for crediting your phone with bitcoin worldwide, it matches bitcoin's global nature well which is probably why it gets [15000 transactions per month](
* Bitcoin casinos are doing a roaring trade too, American users use it to get around the banking blockade against normal casinos. Also it fits with bitcoin's global and permissionless nature.
* If you go on thepiratebay you'll find hundreds of torrent uploaders posting their bitcoin addresses for donations *and people actually donate to them*. Permissionless donations are a great feature of bitcoin that you'll find in lots of places.
* Gamers [especially streamers]( also occasionally get bitcoin donations. They can convert to cash, use to buy steam games or trade for game items such as counterstrike skins.
* People in certain countries cannot access good banking infrastructure, for example bitcoin is the only way for [this guy]( to buy on steam and amazon.
* Lots of people get paid in bitcoin across borders, especially if they can't access bank accounts in their country.
* Hosting providers, VPNs and VPS services almost always take bitcoin payments these days. It fits with bitcoin's global and private nature.
You'll note people are not asking for litecoin or any other crappy alt. They don't care that JP Morgan is "going to" start using Ethereum for something.

Indeed. When the XT coup looked like it might actually change the rules of bitcoin, the price sold off as investors got spooked that decentralization might be degraded.
Now that XT has been convincingly beaten (save for tryhards like this thread) the price rallys. Bitcoin has been through an attempted hostile hardfork and survived the attack. Meaning rules like the 21 million cap are as safe as ever.
For all the criticism of theymos's moderation, eventually people will have to admit that bitcoin became stronger because of it.

Bitcoins are actually held in little applications called "scripts". Most scripts are very simple and say "this bitcoin can be moved if a valid signature to public key X has been shown".
It's also possible to come up with more complicated scripts, such as multisignature, lock time or hash lock. There the script would be something like "this bitcoin can be moved if the current time is more than X, and if a valid signature to public key Y has been shown".
Pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) is an important part of using scripts in bitcoin because it means any arbitrary long and complicated script doesn't need to be converted to a bitcoin address. P2SH addresses are those that start with the character 3.

List of technologies that ASICBOOST gives an incentive to oppose: 
Segwit will be activated via UASF (the BIP149 proposal looks good), it's obvious we can't rely on all miners to do what's best for bitcoin anymore.

Yes it is. No they dont.
Full nodes download the entire blockchain and parse it locally to learn about their wallet. The other nodes learn nothing.

Mining pool not miners but ok. Maybe XT supporters should mine on p2pool and get that protection. Extra mining decentralization is always good.
@_date: 2015-11-10 10:28:17
Bare in mind we can only measure nodes which upload block data (i.e. with -listen=1). That doesn't tell us anything about whether they get used as a wallet.

It's a free market so anybody can easily enter. As long as the coinjoin peers you're transacting with don't collude you will improve your privacy.
In fact if half of joinmarket is made up of the NSA, the other half made up by the Chinese Communist Party and you coinjoin with both, still no individual can for certain deanonymize you.

It should be obvious to anyone reading r/btc for any length of time that they don't care about decentralization as much as they care about "low fees".
Even on this thread we've got hard fork advocates [arguing for BIP101]( which would increase the block size to 8**GB**, and would be the death of a decentralized bitcoin.
theymos hasn't forced anyone to keep quiet. You have a voice. You have your own forums, your own subreddit, the entirety of twitter.
But when you come to our places with your sockpuppets flooding misleading articles, mass-upvoting and using automated downvoting scripts to hide dissenting voices; you can hardly be surprised when moderator muscle was used.
Look how much of a cesspit r/btc is. That's what this place would've become.
If you want to talk about dictatorship, let's talk about Mike Hearn who proclaimed himself the dictator of bitcoin's codebase before he was driven away and now works for the banks. This 8GB BIP101 proposal mentioned earlier was his idea.

Agreed. This screenshot cracks me up whenever I see it 
@_date: 2016-10-03 11:28:48
We should be very proud of that. Bitcoin is doing just fine, despite what naysayers said for years.
I always find it funny how when the price is stable people say it's too stagnant, and when the price is moving people say it's too volatile to be a currency.

They are not quantum safe, Satoshi's coins are in the obsolete pay-to-pubkey style addresses which does not protect the pubkey with hashing.
So yes, Satoshi's coins would be the first to go if ECDSA were broken.

You know how when using a VPN you must delete cookies or use a different browser? Otherwise sites can track you from before and after your VPN.
Well bitcoin is like that, except you can't delete cookies, and the cookies are visible to everyone in the world.
As already mentioned, JoinMarket aims to improve the privacy of these cookies (transactions)
@_date: 2016-05-21 22:52:38
One reason I post this is because of the block size hard fork debate.
A few points:
* Near 10% of all blocks are generated in less than a minute. 5% are generated in under 30 seconds. So any delay in propagation (because of a larger block size, say) can severely eat into a miner's margins and encourage them to centralize.
* Because the block interval is so random, there's not much point aiming for everyone's transaction to be mined within the first block because that could still take 30 minutes to one hour if the network is unlucky. On-chain transactions can never provide a better user experience than payment channels transactions, which are instant and much cheaper.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:57:06
Bitmain was never against Segwit activated via HF, [because that wouldn't break their ASICBOOST patent.](
As a reminder: 
@_date: 2015-11-10 10:30:13
It's entirely possible for miners to mine anonymously. I very much doubt that *miners* got DDOS'd.
@_date: 2017-05-19 00:25:47
There ARE incentives to use full nodes.
Using a full node wallet is like checking that your banknotes are genuine and your gold is real before accepting it for payment. If that's not an incentive I don't know what is.
Full nodes wallets are also the most private wallets, they don't query any third-party server to get your balance, so there's no third party that can spy on you.
Full nodes also protect you from certain kinds of attacks. See the accidental BIP66 chain split where full node wallets were unaffected and lightweight wallets were in danger.
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:02:48
You're aware that the pie chart can be easily faked right? It works by reading what's in the block header text, a miner can write whatever they want.
@_date: 2016-05-22 11:17:05
Yes indeed, with the available technology, there are fundamental trade-offs between scale and decentralization.
It's good that there's is a lot of activity ongoing related to “non-bandwidth” scaling mechanisms. Non-bandwidth scaling mechanisms are tools like transaction cut-through and bidirectional payment channels which increase Bitcoin’s capacity and speed using clever smart contracts rather than increased bandwidth. Critically, these approaches strike right at the heart of the capacity vs autotomy trade-off, and may allow us to achieve very high capacity and very high decentralization.

What if it was sent by a bitcoin institution like an exchange or a marketplace? What if the input was from a p2sh address? What if multiple inputs were combined? If they were a coinjoin?
General rule, there is no *from* address. Don't code any software that makes this assumption.

I would also like people who are can give ideas for some stuff I'm thinking about.
I post ideas on the issue tracker of the github: 
So one thing I'm interested in is the best way to build a tumbler from joinmarket primitives, in the case where you wanted to completely break the link between coins. E.G. You bought bitcoins from bitstamp and tumble them into cold storage because don't want anyone knowing you own them

This kind of thing is a systemic risk to bitcoin. It's not just a case of *"I'm doing nothing private so it won't affect me."*
An essential property of money is fungibility. If anyone could assign the difference between "good" and "bad" bitcoins that property would be destroyed.
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:43:30
That's not true either, 2nd-layer transactions would increase miner revenue by it now making sense to pay $10 per blockchain transaction: 
One big miner is opposing segwit only because it breaks their patented ASICBOOST advantage.

Let's get one thing straight: JoinMarket doesn't help with money laundering.
When you show up somewhere with a suitcase of cash you will be asked to prove your identity and the source of your finds. The same is true for bitcoin, gold coins, baseball cards or any other liquid good. In fact physical cash is far less traceable than bitcoin and the authorities control money laundering perfectly fine with it. Bitcoin is an incredibly niche commodity that draws attention just by being used.
"Encouraging others to participate" is even more laughable. Except in extreme circumstances, no western country punishes people for merely advocating something. I happen to think the US president is a war criminal and is hiding other war criminals from justice. Am I going to prison for this?

Hubs as not as efficient as mesh networks, which is what LN will likely tend towards.


You're seemingly not aware of outsourced channel monitoring.


Sending it now is more expensive beacuse blockchain don't scale requiring MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.


If it doesn't exist then nodes will create it until it does, that single channel could transfer many people's payments without hitting the blockchain. These are simply LN facts which you apparently are unaware of.
It's unfortunate that LN-detractors don't seem to understand the most fundamental facts about how the system they hate works. The ignorance is staggering.

Bitcoin should hard fork to a new PoW algorithm. There I said it.
@_date: 2016-05-15 16:29:32
The fact that ASIC hardware is hard to get is a bad thing because it gives rise to centralization pressure. The best kind of hardware would be some kind of commodity hardware commonly available that almost anybody can get hold of, so GPUs. Without a doubt during the 2012 era of GPU mining, bitcoin hash power was far more decentralized than today.
As you allude, domination by botnets is also bad because botnets are very hard to get hold of, same as ASICs.
I'm not sure an ASIC-resistant PoW is possible (see [this document]( If you have any links I'd like to read them.
According to [this]( proof of stake can never work.

Bitcoin's natural state is full blocks. Without that there's no incentive to include transactions fees that must fund the miners after all bitcoins have been mined.
I for one welcome slightly higher blockchain transactions costs. It will give an incentive to treat the blockchain real estate more carefully. It will also hopefully also end services like [Eternity Wall]( and [CryptoGraffiti]( that incur costs on the entire network. The blockchain is there to be a consensus mechanism for monetary transactions, not as a place to graffiti and pollute.

The ten government agents need to own a huge number of bitcoins they want to coinjoin with everybody. And they have to compete in a free market of everyone else. And even then they stop other sybils from knowing what's going on.
Very few systems are secure against an adversary with infinite money and power. JoinMarket is no exception.
@_date: 2016-10-12 18:35:32
Yes they could. Thing is, money has a network effect which gives a strong incentive for everyone to be using the same currency (the same motivation is why the EU tried to create the Euro)

1. It won't be too bad, not fundamentally different from what we have today where blocks are full and fees are high.
2. It being open source doesn't mean they're not using it, and blocking segwit because of it.
3. There was lots of other crap as well, they fell behind the Core repos and didn't even have features like CPFP
4. ETC was a hard fork, not a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:44:20


Saying that mining is already centralized is not an argument for making it more centralized.
Your blockstream conspiracy theorying really detracts from your post. Plenty of people unrelated to blockstream want Lightning Network because its more efficient technology. And we'd already have it if it wasn't for luddites like yourself. Why on earth do you want every steam game purchase to be stored forever on the blockchain?

Because the alternative is worse. That's why Bittylicious exchange, Bitrefill phone credit and Bustabit casino will support BIP148 because they need scaling or they'll go out of business. Bitcoin's holders need segwit to stop ASICBOOST miner centralization, and we've seen that [users are ready to switch services]( if it means they can use UASF/segwit coins.

This is simply not true. Miners are not merely another kind of central bank.


This doesn't match with the power relations. If we don't like what the miners are doing we can go for a UASF or even a PoW change in extreme circumstances, leaving the miners to go stuff themselves.
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:05:20
Why do you think it's hundreds to thousands that needs to be 'locked away'? Can it really be called 'locking away' if you can make instant transactions for a very-low-fee?

@_date: 2018-04-18 16:14:38
That's not correct.
There may be a chain split because of latency between miners, or because one miner was trying to reverse transactions, or because of bugs in software (see the chain split resulting from BIP66)
Not to mention all the forks like BIP148, BIP65, BIP112 which were forks but did not result in chain splits.

Fair enough.
Segwit is a great new feature; it fixes a bug that makes coding some kinds of smart contracts much harder, it allows algorithms which make bitcoin transactions use less space which are also faster, it fixes a bug which would make bitcoin work faster as more people use it, it allows a way to help lightweight wallets check that the miners havent printed infinite bitcoins.

This seems like an interesting and important discussion about JoinMarket over tor, mind posting it to the joinmarket subreddit?
From my reading on bitcoin-over-tor, the client *should not* download from the rest of the network over tor because of sybil attacks. 
But then to get better privacy, bitcoin core *must* broadcast it's transactions over tor. 
Is there a way to get tails to run Bitcoin Core over the clearnet? I've never used that OS.
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:43:03
Miners have an incentive to include as many transactions inside blocks as possible in order to collect the transaction fee. So if solely left up to the miners, blocks would become huge almost without bound, which would make it much more difficult for non-mining nodes to download, store and validate them. If it becomes too difficult and costly to run a node then the bitcoin network would stop being decentralized.
It comes down to the fact that miners create the blocks but full nodes have to pay for storing and validating them.
A reminder of why widespread bitcoin nodes are important. They are the only entities that make sure the rules of bitcoin are followed. Rules like the 21m money supply limit, not spending coins that don't belong to you and rules like difficulty that make mining work. Nodes are the only way to use bitcoin that minimizes the amount of trust needed in others.

Seriously though, high miner fees mean your business could have two choices:

By running a node you can be sure that no inflation has happened outside schedule, no coins are being spent not belonging to their owner and none of the other rules of bitcoin (e.g. difficulty) are being broken. Plus you can actually be sure a transaction has happened confirmed in the blockchain instead of trusting others.
Also you have the most private way to look up addresses and transactions. All other wallets not relying on a full node need to tell some server which addresses are theirs.

A full node is the most secure possible wallet. It's the only kind of wallet that allows you to check that no extra inflation has happened, no coin was spent without the private key being known, and all the other bitcoin rules (e.g. difficulty) are being followed. Bitcoin-Qt might not be to your taste (It doesnt have HD wallets which is an issue for me) but wallets like Armory are also built on full nodes and offer the same security.

Yes, miners want to collect as much as they can in fees, so they sort the mempool by fee rate and mine block sequentially. Which means if you want a fast confirmation you pay a higher fee rate. If you don't mind waiting in return for lower fees that's possible too.

The blockchain has grown to hundreds of gigabytes in size and we've lost a large amount of our full nodes since 2011. What's more mining is also far more centralized today than earlier.

I think it's a fair analogy. Without the money supply cap, bitcoin wouldn't have value because it would be inflated forever. Without the block size limit, bitcoin wouldn't have value because it would end up centralized.
Bitcoin is definitely *not* whatever the miners want it to be. It's a very common misconception that in bitcoin the miners control everything. If the miners create a block that breaks some of bitcoin's rules (like printing more bitcoins than allowed, or spending someone else's coins) then the economy will reject those blocks as if they never existed. See [this post]( for a longer discussion of what makes bitcoin valuable.
For me, trusting the miners would be the same as trusting central banks. The Core github by contrast is very open, like many open source projects the only elitism is programming knowledge. If you know how to code you can just get involved.

An individual maker's fees won't be too different from anyone else because of market forces. There will surely be many many people offering to make coinjoin at almost exactly the same fee.


There is a disincentive against this happening because it's likely that large single coins will earn a higher fee than split up small coins.
Imagine how many people own 0.1btc vs how many people own 10kbtc. Lack of supply will make the price go up, so people will have an incentive to lump their coins together not split them up.

Cryptography (digital signatures, proof of work, etc) allows everybody to tell whether a coin is valid. A physical analogy is how paper banknotes have UV ink, microlettering, watermarks, holographic strips, etc which help anyone check whether a banknote is real. (Although cryptography is far stronger than these physical features)
The idea of consensus is how the network stops counterfeits having value, because coins that are not valid will be rejected and ignored as if they never existed. So you cannot pay someone with an invalid coin because it simply wont appear in their wallet.

It could result that small-value transfers like online casinos and mobile phone top-ups get priced out of the blockchain. I would have expected that these businesses would fight for their survival by organizing for a UASF, which could still happen.

It's not a misconception, that's how bitcoin works.
The only job the miners have is to set the history of bitcoin transactions. Yes that means they can reverse transactions if one individually has enough hash power but they cannot break any of the other rules of bitcoin.
Using a fully-validating wallet is like checking that your cash or gold is genuine before accepting it. If a miner printed more than 21 million bitcoins or spent the same bitcoin more than once, then the stupid SPV wallets would blindly go along with it. That's why full validation is so important.
You're advocating a downgraded security model for bitcoin. This has rightly been rejected by the bitcoin community.

It's worth adding that merkle proofs are proof that the transaction was mined, but not that it was valid.
So if a miner mined a transaction that created bitcoins out of nothing, SPV wallets would accept it but full nodes would reject it, because creating bitcoin out of nothing is not allowed.

We have wondered this.
From a physical laws point of view it makes sense. Energy is the ultimate commodity and you create bitcoins by converting an equal amount of energy value.
Right now the bitcoin network releases 25 bitcoins on average every 10 minutes. Those bitcoins are worth 25 * usd/btc, if you're just doing cheap digital signatures, someone else has to undercut you somehow so they can get the valuable 25 bitcoins instead. Because of the economic law of marginal cost == marginal utility, the cost of produce 25 bitcoins always has to be somewhere close to 25*usd/btc.
You can also think of it like a military. If everyone was nice and could trust each other, we could live under pacifism. Unfortunately invasions happen so a military is necessary. Military spending is like bitcoin mining, the only use of it is to have more than the bad guys.

Regarding your big-blocker-ism, you must realize that blockchains don't scale? You're clearly a smart guy and I don't get how you don't see this.
Blockchains inherently have O(N) scaling. The only way for them to work is to limit N, so there's a tradeoff between scale and decentralization.

Paypal can freeze your account whenever they want - With Bitcoin you're the only one who can do something with it.
Bitcoin works anywhere in the world, Paypal doesn't operate in many countries.
Bitcoin transactions are final, Paypal can charged back months afterwards.
Bitcoin has multisig which can be used to create escrow, Paypal isn't programmable money so can't.

They have significant drawbacks. They either require you to store the entire transaction index on disk, or you have to outsource the searching to a third party who can completely ruin your privacy. There are ideas for non-outsourcable addresses but they're still not very practical.
Also getting any new address type adopted is very hard (p2sh took years) and name "stealth address" is needlessly political. Can you imagine coinbase telling their regulators they just implemented this thing called stealth addresses. A better one might be "reusable donation address".
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:19:36
Having the whole blockchain is the most private way to lookup information about your wallet balance. All other methods involve telling a third party which addresses are yours. Also by running a node you can be sure that the rules of bitcoin are being followed (no inflation outside of schedule, no coins spent without knowledge of the private key, etc)
It's a trade-off of course. Many people use smartphone wallets which can't have the entire blockchain, which is absolutely fine for most users.
I'd say the best advice is to avoid paper wallets which use a single private key and address because it encourages bad practices and is not very safe, especially since most are generated from JavaScript/HTML pages. 
A safer alternative is to generate a HD wallet (for example with Electrum, Mycelium, Armory, etc) and write down the mnemonic recovery seed.
If you must use a single wallet, you can write down the private key and address yourself with paper. The encoding is chosen to not use similar-looking characters like Il0O, and there is error-checking.
The problem hardware wallets solve is that almost no consumer computer hardware can be trusted, almost all of it could get malware or be hacked. An alternative to hardware wallets is multisig wallets. The idea is that the same malware is unlikely to be on several different kinds of hardware. You can create these wallets with Electrum and Armory. I'm sure hardware wallets are fine too (although I don't own one, I'm too cheap)

As an investor who doesn't make any transactions, you are completely unaffected by the chain split. Only if you actually want to make a transaction you have to pick a side (and if you're hodling you won't need to do that for years by which time the chain split will probably have resolved itself)
Remember if the BIP148-chain gets more work than the non-BIP148-chain then they'll be a big chain reorg and the non-BIP148-chain will cease to exist.
If you want to support one chain against another you can sell the bitcoins on that chain to buy bitcoins on the other chain. Otherwise doing nothing is fine.

It's correct to say that vast majority of developers in the space hold the position that blocks must have an upper limit in size, and that blockchain space must be scarce.
Satoshi's answer there relies on the SPV described in his paper. That requires fraud proofs which don't exist yet. Segwit would be [a big step in the way to creating a fraud proof system]( so I hope you agree with me that segwit should be activated as soon as possible.

It was exactly like this the last time bitcoin had a sustained bull run. Some sther alts saw larger % gains and then had massive crashes when bitcoin dropped.

Firstly they'd need your wallet.dat file to get the encrypted seed. For that they need to be on your computer.
I think the passphrase mostly protects against other mostly-non-technical people on your computer.

I remember soon after the first halvening, some miners patched their code to keep producing 50btc per block. Their blocks were rejected by the economic majority, and the miners reverted their patch pretty quickly when they realized how much money they were losing(!)
Miners can extend whatever chain they want, but unless the economic majority accepts their blocks as payment those miners are simply mining fool's gold.
Hashpower follows price. The special thing about bitcoin compared to alts is that people actually use it for commerce and it therefore has a much higher price. That results in a high income for anyone mining it which results in the high hashrate.

Since BIP32 is hierarchical, you could create a new branch which is only used for withdrawals from that exchange. Give the exchange the xpub key of that branch and it will not be able to see any of your other addresses.

I don't think that's true. P2SH was activated via [UASF]( Also all of Satoshi's soft forks including adding MAX_BLOCK_SIZE were done this way too.

Good points. Well made.
Big blockers are selling a future where trust is further introduced into bitcoin. We would be expected to trust the miners, we would be expected to trust data centers. I say no. Private keys should be a true claim to ownership of bitcoin, not just a fancy password for a database somewhere.
Let's not forget that big blockers were warning of 'collapse' of bitcoin if block sizes were not raised. These claims now looks ridiculous after 18 months of bull market. Why do some people still listen to big blockers regarding segwit? We need to move towards a user-activated-soft-fork (UASF) of segwit because some miners are abusing their positions to block it and protect their entrenched positions.

SPV wallets are not secure. If 51% of miners create infinite bitcoins, spend a bitcoin twice or spend a non-existant coin, then the stupid SPV wallets will blindly go along with them.
Bitcoin requires most of the economic majority to use full node wallets. SPV is a degradation of security which we must reject.
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:04:24


Not really. As long as people use full nodes they will ignore any invalid blocks. Miners can mine whatever they like but unless they follow the rules they won't be paid for their efforts.
LTC is a great example because the miners only buckled when they saw that the litecoin community was ready, willing, able and even eager to go for a UASF.

I wouldn't call "freezing the chain" a minimal attack surface. All bitcoins everywhere are frozen. As the attackers have &gt;50% of hash power, they can keep it up forever until we hard fork. The currency would be stopped same way as Liberty Reserve.
If the miners get nationalized by the Communist Party of China with the stroke of a pen, they won't be in a position to care about their long-term investments.

It's only in very specific situations it has an effect.
1. If you're using a wallet which incorrectly handles malleability. You may see the wrong balance or even a negative balance like some blockchain explorers showed. Hopefully in time these software bugs should be fixed.
1. If you're trying to spend unconfirmed change, for example if you make many transactions in quick succession.
I've also created and received bitcoin transactions fairly regularly over the past few weeks and they've all been absolutely fine.

@_date: 2017-05-03 02:15:00
I agree that the poster is slightly overselling bitcoin, but some of your points aren't accurate either, and positively wrong in some cases!




This is totally not right. A normal user could hide or [memorize]( as mnemonic recovery seed, and there's very little anyone could do about it. There's hundreds of places to hide 12 random words if you use your imagination.
Yes if people use web wallets or otherwise get it wrong, they could be in trouble. But this community widely advises not doing that, and regularly upvotes threads warning people not to use web wallets or store coins on exchanges.




Segwit does not change the security model of bitcoin. It has no effect. Lightning Network doesn't even exist yet, and when it does people are free to not use it if they require the better security properties of the blockchain (which they probably would for high-value transactions)




Yes if people do things wrong then they'll be in trouble. But it's totally possible to use bitcoin in a very private way, and many people do this in practice today.




This is completely wrong. The bitcoin github accepts patches from anyone just like the firefox github. I have no idea where you're getting this from because it's simply not true. The "development team" is anyone who submits a patch, same as for any other open source project.
Not to mention even if the github doesn't accept your patches, the code can still be **read** to check it's not doing anything bad, and you can always fork it to make your own modifications.




Even if it's illegal, it's intentionally designed to provide financial sovereignty to the user. Bitcoin is illegal in socialist Venezuela but people still use it.




This is incredibly misleading. Miners do not control bitcoin, they only set the history of transactions. See this page for more details ( but the summary is miners can't be compared to some centralized controller.




In practice all bitcoin services use escrow for consumer protection, and it works perfectly well. Because as you say, otherwise fraud would destroy the system.

It's **not** a lender because private keys never leave the market maker's wallet. They always have full control over their coins, the software won't sign a transaction unless it sees all the coins are going to the right place in the right amounts.
A market maker who is doing it for the purpose of profit would run a *yield-generator.py* script which would do everything. You could probably run it from a raspberry pi. Just need to own bitcoins and have power + internet connection.
You can also have market makers who want to coinjoin but dont mind waiting around, so they put up offers and wait instead of initiating and paying.
@_date: 2015-03-17 12:59:56
That's good if true.
Another issue is blockchain.info knows the mapping between inputs and outputs. With JoinMarket the only person who knows the mapping is the one who paid to do a coinjoin. Since they paid for it they presumably have an incentive to keep the mapping a secret.

By pushing for a hard fork they have completely ignored large segments of the bitcoin economic consensus.
There are a significant number of people in the economic majority who are digital gold fundamentalists. They watch the price go up and don't care about high miner fees (in fact they prefer them because it means bitcoin will be secure in the zero-inflation era). So they have absolutely no reason to do a hard fork to help increase capacity. People with this view have been in bitcoin since the very beginning and own much of the important infrastructure and many coins.
The increase-blockchain-capacity side needs to appeal to the digital gold side, but there's nothing they could give. The digital-gold side wants for nothing, the value of their coins went up 10x recently and is hitting new ATHs all the time.
So I'm happy to say that anyone proposing a hard fork to increase capacity has no understanding of the underlying politics. It's like someone walking into Jerusalem saying *"I've found a solution to the Israel/Palestine conflict, just give all the land to the Koreans!"*

If you're interested in bitcoin privacy you should look at JoinMarket.
JoinMarket is an open source decentralized bitcoin privacy project. The software runs on your own hardware. It works using the CoinJoin protocol. The private keys never your computer so nobody can steal your coins. The decentralization means there is no one entity who can spy on you.
Other mixing services mix your coins with other users, resulting in you getting back coins possibly related to drugs, stolen money or other practices you might not want to be involved in. This is highly undesirable if you just don't want your employer knowing which non-profits you support from your salary. Because of the incentives of JoinMarket, you have access to a huge amount of clean, untainted bitcoins to mix with at a very low price. Many of the bitcoins you're mixing with will be bought from regulated exchanges, owned by normal holders of bitcoin.
Not to mention you'd likely be paying lower fees for mixing than other centralized services, because of the competition between willing-to-wait coinjoiners. Indeed if you don't mind waiting, you can wait around with a low offer fee and maybe another impatient coinjoiner will join with you.

Other people have mentioned that fees take over from inflation.

Bitcoin requires a block size limit to stay decentralized: 
Fee sniping: 
And finally, there's no incentive to pay miner fees unless block space is scarce. Bitcoin requires miner fees to survive for when inflation drops to zero.

If you think I'm misinformed then you have to provide evidence.
I've got my evidence: that altcoin blocks are empty or near-empty, their miner fees are basically zero which would make it cheap to fill up the blocks with fake transactions, but nobody even bothers.
The DAO can't be considered commerce, but speculation. People were using it for investment purposes, it was an investment that may or may not (and in the DAO's case did not) pay off.
Bitcoin can be traded in almost any city in the world, it has a big network on localbitcoins traders, bitcoin ATMs, bitcoin debit cards, etc. Any time people use alts the easiest and cheapest way to trade is to convert between bitcoin. There's no Ethereum ATMs or Litecoin ATMs because Bitcoin ATMs already exist. That's the network effect, it's very strong and it's a massive reason why altcoins aren't used for commerce.

If/when that future legislation gets passed, simply stop offering coinjoins. Very few legal systems will retrospectively punish. 
You may be surprised just how common CoinJoin becomes in the future. 


Just set your prices so it more than covers the miners fee.


No that sucks. The point of JoinMarket is that anyone can coinjoin immediately without any hassle or waiting around. If you really want you could run a bot which gives you back an unsigned transaction which you copy to cold storage and sign. But the market makers will still be online.

Yes there is an internal HD wallet.
Your private keys never leave your computer. All kinds of CoinJoin have zero counterparty risk because the software won't sign a transaction not to its liking.
The only risk is that you have to keep your coins on an online computer instead of in cold storage.
Nobody knows what a market maker would earn / what a coinjoin would cost. If you can think of a way to price it let me know.

In fact fees are beneficial to you.
Bitcoin can only be inflation-free if miners have a sustainable income as inflation goes down. Miner fees keep your unseizable digital gold safe and secure.
Before about 12 months ago, nobody knew whether the whole "fees-gradually-take-over-from-inflation" idea would actually work. Now we know. That's surely a big part of the confidence boost that made the price rise.
I wish some miners would end their opposition to segwit and then we could build good layer-2 protocols that allow people to make very cheap, instant and private bitcoin transcations. But if they don't bitcoin will be fine, and we might even activate segwit via UASF regardless of what the miners do.

People would run it for the benefit of fully-validating all the rules of bitcoin. Also a full node is the most private way of using bitcoin because no third-party server learns which addresses are yours.

And here we are with full blocks that have been full for months. In the middle of a rally, at all-time-high levels, with new users and investors pouring in. Mike Hearn has sold out to the banks and the rest of us are still here watching the price go up.


Every today over on rbtc you can see people calling segwit a "poison pill". The big names know its too popular to publicly opposed but they do everything they can to stop it activating. Jihan even threw money at Vertcoin and Litecoin mining to try to stop segwit activating there, before a UASF threat forced his hand.

Those people will have to wait for a quiet time on the block (i.e. not now) and then merge all their UTXOs together. Only 3 weeks ago (when the exchange rate was more stable) mempools were actually empty over the weekend and blocks were mined half-full. I got stuff mined for 1 sat/b back then.
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:00:33


There must be transactions still in the miner's mempool after a block has appeared. If there was no block size limit then a single block could empty the entire mempool and therefore the next miner wouldn't have any transaction fees to try to collect, and so the incentive to snipe the earlier block's transactions is strong enough to be a danger to bitcoin.

They will merge but never in a way that it would ruin the privacy of previous coinjoins.
Essentially each market maker creates several wallets from the HD seed. Coins can switch between these wallets only with a coinjoin and the change addresses will stay in the same wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:49:10
Then they will have less decentralization than bitcoin, and therefore be less valuable.
You underestimate how strong network effects are for something like a currency. There's hundreds of Bitcoin ATMs worldwide, but not a single Ethereum ATM or Litecoin ATM. And no-one would ever create one because it can't compete with simply buying bitcoin and trading for the alt. That's the network effect.

@_date: 2015-10-14 15:43:53
That's unfortunate. As the linked post says, there are a few attacks when running bitcoin-over-tor.
There is no downside to keeping up with the network, downloading the blockchain and relaying new transactions or blocks over clearnet. No privacy information is leaked just by doing this. (Except the fact that you're using bitcoin itself, although downloading 40gb+ worth of data, with extra downloads in time with bitcoin block broadcasts might also give this away anyway)
What is a privacy issue is broadcasting your own transactions, a spy can observe an outgoing transaction that was not previously incoming. That needs to be done over tor.

Then we should build fraud proofs **first**.
Oh look, segwit helps with fraud proofs(!) and you're opposing it(!)
From the segwit talk at scalingbitcoin hongkong:






This is not true, plenty of people use full node wallets for the privacy benefits (because its the only way to learn your wallet history without a third party server being able to spy on you). Also what matters is economic majority, not number of people.


This is also not true.
Here is academic research showing that even small (2MB) increases to the blocksize results in drastic node dropoff counts due to the non-linear increase of RAM needed. 


No, this is a degrading of bitcoin's security model and it must be rejected. Most people who use money don't care about it's soundness. They would would read on the news that miners printed more than 21 million bitcoins and then just shrug and carry on.
Bitcoin's properties have to be protected via cryptographic validation, not by some users reading bitcoin newspapers to hear about cheating miners.

So yield generator? Running a market maker bot for the purpose of profit?
@_date: 2016-05-31 01:57:12
Yep, but on the other hand we had more than a year of the tx volume going up with the price staying the same, so who knows how much they're linked.
@_date: 2016-05-20 14:38:01
I haven't looked but what would make most sense is if the in-game money was convertible for bitcoin.
It would have to mean the game can't create in-game money any other way (e.g. when you kill a monster, it can't drop money because that would mean there's money not backed by real bitcoins)

He's being misleading in an effort to pump his own holdings. All other alts use the same technology (blockchains) and if they got anywhere near as many users are bitcoin they would run into the same scalability issues.

Segwit transactions are just another kind of bitcoin transaction. Miners mine them as normal and collect the miner fee.
The reason segwit transactions are different is they represent certain data structures differently. This gives them [a number of excellent features](
The original talk at the Hong Kong conference has a lot more details: 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:50:38
Your caution is commendable and this kind of approach is exactly how a bitcoin business owner should be behaving.
Have you read this blog post? 
It's about the risk of a re-org. A potential risk for non-BIP148 nodes is that they will have bitcoins that later simply disappear in a big re-organization. This happens because segwit is a soft fork, so the BIP148 chain is valid to non-BIP148 nodes but not vis versa.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:47:42
Core has produced segwit, which has massive support in ever sector of bitcoin's economy as can be seen multiple pieces of evidence. The only people holding it back are some miners like Bitmain because it breaks their ASICBOOST patent.
@_date: 2015-10-20 16:19:54
Electrum and Bitcoin Core already do. :)

Yes there are plans. But first we want to get the underlying engine as robust as possible. You know that when the GUI comes out the underlying bitcoin code will be really good.

IANAL but from what I know, anti-money laundering laws come into effect if you're transacting more than $10000, in which case you need to fill out some paperwork to check you didnt get the money by crime. So if you stick to small amounts below $10000 you should be ok(?)
It's not even clear that you're transacting any money here, since the coins go straight back to you.
@_date: 2015-10-12 09:23:56

2. Yes

A final thing to add, the transaction identifier is only changable while the transaction is unconfirmed. Once it's been mined into a block the identifier won't change.

Bitcoin Core does it correctly, if you use `estimatefee` and `estimatepriority` you wont go wrong. Too bad that third party services (even flashy ones like tradeblock) still have bugs.
We go on and on about not trusting third parties, maybe *this* time people will listen and realise running their own node is the best?
@_date: 2015-10-02 09:27:49
When was this and what happened?
@_date: 2017-05-05 23:24:19
Yep, that's one method that some people do.
You can also use any other lightweight wallet that lets you connect only to your own full node. I hear Greenbit also allows this.
@_date: 2017-05-08 20:48:22
You coinjoin them with a UTXO that only exists on one chain. So the transaction will be valid on one chain but not the other
So for example if one chain is longer than the other, you could use nlocktime to get a transaction confirmed on just one chain. Then coinjoin that with the rest of your wallet when you send it to an exchange to dump the BTU.
BTW, spending coins doesn't require revealing your private key to anyone. Ownership in bitcoin is done with digital signatures.

Claiming you bought them from some guy with cash with no evidence is NOT enough to pass anti-money laundering.
With bitcoin they could also ask you to a sign a message with the private key of your address that was used in 2010. Notice that you can't do that with cash, yet society enforces anti-money laundering for cash just fine.
@_date: 2017-05-19 00:14:59
Sorry but you're post is all wrong.
Fact is that bitcoin requires a block size limit significantly below demand to stay decentralized. Blockchain inherently don't scale and scaling will have to happen in layer-2 protocols.

Do you want to just send individual coinjoins, send repeated coinjoins to anonymize coins, run a yield generator or all three? I'd like to get an idea of what kind of people would like to use JM but are stopped by no GUI.
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:31:37
UASFs work by having the [economic majority]( say that it will enforce the new soft fork.
It goes back to the reasoning for why miners create blocks that follow the rules of bitcoin. Miners print money and they could get a higher income by printing more money, so why don't they? The reason is that full nodes verify all the rules of bitcoin and won't accept any blocks that break those rules. So if a miner creates 1000btc instead of the allowed 12.5btc they won't be able to trade those bitcoins for anything. UASF is just when a new soft fork is added so that miners have to follow that rule too.

Yeah... looks like that might happen.
I'm in bitcoin for the long haul, segwit can activate 5 or 10 years from now.
BUT that would mean the lower-value uses would probably be priced out. The businesses would have to shut down. You'd think they'd be fighting harder for their survival with a UASF but it seems not.

Yes it is. Because the process has no memory and is progress-free, there's no way it can peak at anything other than zero.

Enable pruning and you wont need to store it on your hard drive
@_date: 2015-10-18 22:43:21
Disabling the wallet was a very short term solution because the devs wanted to release pruning as quickly as they could. In the next release bitcoin core 0.12 will have wallets enabled with pruning (with -txindex and -rescan disabled)

Loads people do this in my experience, depending on their individual security needs. The download figures for Tails OS look healthy, and this matches with my experience.
But the point still stands, the fact that some people use bitcoin in a less-than-secure way doesn't mean bitcoin itself isn't secure.


I respectfully suggest you look harder. I know plenty.
What's more even if you get bitcoin via an un-private method it's not too difficult to disconnect those bitcoins from your identity.


I wouldn't. But if you're in a dictatorship like Venezuela or Turkey which has internet then bitcoin will work. The fact that bitcoin doesn't solve Congo's internet problems doesn't mean its worthless as a censorship-resistant currency.
By analogy, BitTorrent completely changed the way people access media, that happened even though the Congo didn't have access to it.


Read the part about what the miner *cant* do.
    Reverse other people's transactions without their cooperation
    Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
    Change the number of coins generated per block
    Create coins out of thin air
    Send coins that never belonged to him
A government can do all those things, including hyperinflating their fiat currency into worthlessness if that's what they wanted.
Although there were discussions about censoring Snowden's address, it never actually happened because no miner had &gt;50%, and if they did they have better things to do.


Here are the first few escrow-using services I can think of: Localbitcoins, Silkroad, Alphabay, Purse.io, Cryptothrift, Bitmit.com, BitGo, Bitrated.
Here is [Mike Hearn talking about the concept of multisig escrow in 2012]( So I respectfully suggest you need to read more if you try to downplay bitcoin's ability to have consumer protection.
The latest I've read from Bitpay, most of their customers use it for business-to-business transfers as a replacement to bank wires. Bank wires already don't have consumer protection so bitcoin in this case doesn't make any change.


Nobody has said there is no fraud. But fraud can be effectively controlled, and is controlled in all successful bitcoin businesses.

I mean I understand his point. Only a few days ago we were being asked to pay 430 satoshi/byte (!!!) in miner fees for our transactions. Erik Voorhees' business makes a lot of transactions so this is no doubt a significant cost them.
Will we be having the same conversation at 1000 sat/b ? 5000 sat/b? or even 10000 sat/b? At some point the risks of UASF become less than the actual cost of high miner fees.


From: 
Also all of us who are interested in bitcoin as money that cannot be debased should be very alarmed at Bitmain owning a patent to ASICBOOST which gives them a massive advantage in mining and will eventually destroy bitcoin's decentralization.

I'd say it didn't work because the price was only above $1000 for a couple of weeks before dropping in a 18-month-long bear market.
Now that the exchange rate can be expected to be above 1k then we should switch. We should agree on which symbol to use (I prefer mBTC) and then exchanges, marketplaces, wallets and casinos should switch to it by default.

Ethereum and ZCash are centralized. Their dictators-in-chief can do whatever they want with it, Ethereum has already done this once by rolling back the chain to bail the developers out of their bad code.

That's not what the phrase "hard fork" means. Hard fork means the new rules are not backward compatible, which doesn't apply to segwit. Segwit is a soft fork.
Cryptocurrency hashrates follow price very closely. So for the UASF to succeed it only needs to the UASFchain to have a higher value than the nonUASFchain. If that happens then soon the UASFchain will overtake the nonUASFchain in total work and the nonUASFchain will be wiped out in a big chain reorganization.
There have been other chain splits because of soft forks. A good example is the accidental chain split after the BIP66 soft fork. But note that it quickly healed itself and the only entities that lost money where the miners who took part in mining the wrong chain. That's why many people think miners will switch over quickly to the UASFchain.

Segwit was about to activated on vertcoin but a mystery pool appeared using rented hardware. Some unknown person was losing 10btc per day stopping vertcoin from activating segwit.

Bitcoin itself is not natural, its entirely man-made by someone in 2008-9.
The reasons for the block size limit are ultimately physical; blocks take a certain amount of time to propagate and be verified.
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:26:14
No because nobody knows for sure. (Except for the genesis block address)
Some attempts at a list of Satoshi's addresses contained addresses that other people ended up being owners of.
The first block after the genesis block was mined a day or two after the release of bitcoin, it seems Satoshi gave other people a chance to mine after it went public.

Empty blocks stop working as bitcoin inflation goes to zero and miners only make money from fees. As that happens it will be pointless to mine empty blocks and smaller miners will simply lose money to big miners, a strong centralizing effect.
If there was no relay network, small miners would definitely lose money to big miners. Read the analysis here: 
xthin, compact blocks or any other tech that pre-forwards the data is vulnerable to the attack where large miners don't forward data. Large miners have an incentive to do this.

If you look up the concept of a market capitalization you'll see it only applies to the stock market.
Look for liquidity, i.e. how easy and cheap it is to actually trade your altcoins for something else. Bitcoin has a massive network of localbitcoins traders, OTC traders, bitcoin ATMs, the entire bitcoin casino scene, the DNMs, bitcoin debit cards, bitcoin donation accepting places, etc. Altcoins have very very little of these things and they haven't gone up since the rally, and [if they exist they don't get used.](
By the way, bitcoin requires full blocks to function in the long term. Also, the last several months saw a big bitcoin bull market and altcoins always rally up even more. This pattern was repeated in the 2013 bull market (but with different altcoins) only for those coins to crash hard in the bear market and never recover. You ever heard of Peercoin, Dogecoin, Quark or Namecoin?

It shouldn't be surprising, high miner fees are bullish for bitcoin's exchange rate.
It means people's marginal utility of using bitcoin is at least 350 sat/b for 1 confirm (or whatever it is today). It's one of the strongest evidence that bitcoin is actually used for something beyond speculation.
Long-term bitcoin requires fees to pay for mining as inflation drops to zero. People who use bitcoin as a store of value (i.e. those who have the most influence on price) should love it when miner fees go up because it means their digital gold has a sustainable future. Until miner fees started going up about 12 months ago nobody had any idea whether the whole miner-fees-replace-inflation thing would even work.
In the last few months the price going up has been accompanied by fee rates going up.

In addition to this scheme, you have to be careful of other methods that also result in privacy loss.
Don't use a wallet like Electrum or Breadwallet that connects to a third-party for synchronization because otherwise that server/node can see all your wallet addresses and link them together. The best wallet for privacy in this respect is a full node because it downloads the entire blockchain and scans it locally.
Split up your transactions into many amounts, because if you start with X btc and some time later there is a transaction of (X - fees) btc then it isn't too hard to link them together.
Privacy in bitcoin is a massive topic. And yes there's certainly big claims of groups supposedly being able to unmix bitcoin transactions with not much evidence or results.

If &gt;50% of hash power supports segwit, they can just orphan the non-segwit supporting blocks until the 95% threshold is reached.

You're confusing two issues here: securing the blockchain and minting new coins.
The difficulty of finding new mining solutions (called "blocks") is unrelated to new coins being minted. Instead, the difficulty goes up and down depending on how much mining power is used on the network. The difficulty of calculation is adjusted so a new solution happens on average every 10 minutes. To put it another way, right now 25 new bitcoins are created every 10 minutes, this is true whether one person mines with a CPU or whether ten thousand people mine with huge warehouses filled with hardware.
In answer to your second question, after the minting of new coins drops to very low levels, miners will depend on bitcoin transaction fees for their income.

edit: Reading it in a bit more detail, one of the attacks is delaying block propagation which tor may not help with since it's quite slow, unless the delay is very extreme.

They should be able to use tor. If Venuzuela blocks access to tor they should be able to ask for tor bridges. Tor is extensively used to bypass Chinese internet censorship so there should be lots of literature around.
A problem with tor is that exit nodes have an easier time doing man-in-the-middle attacks which may end with you having your bitcoins stolen. So use 2FA always.
Some bitcoin webites like blockchain.info have their own .onion tor hidden service which bypasses tor exit nodes.

Stocks all have known owners, and the market cap calculation is only used when there is sufficient liquidity. You can also find penny stocks with no market depth that had one trade for $0.02 a share and apparently make the company worth hundreds of millions. And yes people get scammed by them too just like with altcoins.


Bitcoin is designed with privacy in mind, this is a good thing. So you won't find any objective measure of liquidity. But it should be obvious to anyone with eyes that bitcoin is actually used for commerce and no altcoin is.


Probably just my-first-lemonade-stand that never got any bitcoin sales anyway. Bitcoin's localbitcoins traders, OTC traders, bitcoin ATMs, the entire bitcoin casino scene, the DNMs, bitcoin debit cards, bitcoin donation accepting places, etc are still going strong.

It has to be said that in 2013/14 many people were misunderstanding bitcoin, the low fees on the blockchain could never last forever.

The opposite is true, fees must take over from inflation sooner or later so bitcoin needs *high* miner fees to succeed and stay secure.

If you send your coins to someone else (exchange) then they can control which fork your coins will be on.
So you'd deposit them into the exchange, the fork happens (or doesnt) and when you withdraw you only get them on the BIP101 fork (or whichever fork the exchange follows)


Any coins you have before the fork will exist on both forks until you move them.
If you want to make sure your wallet follows the fork you want then you must run a full node. Otherwise your lightweight wallet will follow whichever fork the peers do (i.e. an Electrum wallet will follow whichever fork the Electrum server it's connected to does)

What's likely to happen is that as the block reward halves a few more times, the energy that's put into mining will also drastically drop. Lots of energy use is only necessary for distributing the currency in the first place, rather than securing it long term I think.
Also note that Denmark isn't very a big. It has a population of only about 5 million, it is generally quite efficient with it's energy usage (insulated houses and so on.) Bitcoin using that energy to provide a currency to 7 billion people is not too far of a step actually.

It's not hyperbole, the privacy of everyone related really is degraded.
Reused addresses will probably be around forever. I totally understand a printed static QR code is much easier. I think the trick is to regain privacy after you've lost it.
I'm working on a project to solve this. Called JoinMarket, its an implementation of CoinJoin which has all the right incentives.

I've been talking to some people about why they reuse addresses lately. A big reason is that many exchanges require you to lock the withdrawal address so a hacker finds it much harder to withdraw your money to his own address.
The solution there is to give the address a xpub bip32 key that generates a new receiving address each time. A problem is that almost no wallet supports exporting a xpub key at this time. So we need to ask wallet authors to do this.

Now that [bitfury]( only sells shipping container sized miners, how many different miners are actually left?
Thats why I think Bitcoin should hard fork to a new PoW algorithm to return us to 2012 levels of decentralization with GPUs.
The network spends more than $1 million every day on the miners. Despite that mining is [terribly centralized]( providing barely any security against actors who could seize or coerce the mining hardware. Bitcoin only has value if it's decentralized, I believe it's in the rational self-interest of the economy backed by full nodes to hard fork to a new PoW.
When new ASICs become created for the new PoW, the bitcoin economy majority should simply hard fork again.

CoinJoin-initiators don't take the cheapest offer, they take a random offer weighted by price. So 0% still doesn't guarantee you coinjoin with everyone.
Remember not all people who desire privacy are hiding from the US government (some are hiding from the Chinese government! CoinJoining with Uncle Sam still keeps the CCP in the dark.) This project would still go a huge way towards increasing general privacy against all but the most determined enemies, and restoring fungibility.
Governments may have unlimited fiat but they don't have unlimited value. Printing a couple more billion doesn't increase the amount of value in the real economy. Anyway if they really had an unlimited budget they could put a huge amount of bitcoin full nodes online and crowd out everyone else.
Ring signatures or other exotic crypto would require a hard fork or an altcoin. Bitcoin has an overwhelming amount of liquidity, market cap, users, etc. The point of privacy is that you hide amongst the crowd, an altcoin focused only on privacy still provides a smaller anonymity set.
This project provides a much larger anonymity set because it convinces normal bitcoin investors, many of whom bought coins from fully-regulated exchanges, to mix with you. All other projects I've seen mix your unprivate dirty coins with other people's unprivate dirty coins.

It's unrelated to a UASF. If a miner coalition has &gt;50% then they can do that today, there's no need to wait for August or any flag day.

You can buy but you'll need to pick a side.
Note that the non-UASF side can be wiped out and all its transactions gone if the UASF chain gets more work on it. Because it's a soft fork, the UASFchain is compatible with the other but not vis versa. So from an investors point of view it's safer to get the UASF coins, this is one reason why a lot of us believe the split will be very short lived. (It's not a hard fork after all)

If you thought the block size conflict was bad, wait til you see the money supply conflict.
To resist it, as much as possible of the bitcoin economy must be backed by full nodes, only they can know that all the rules of bitcoin are being followed.
BTW for those of you saying removing the coin cap would crash the price because investors would sell, realize that idea is complete bullshit. Central bank currencies like the EUR, CHF, USD and JPY do not have a supply limit yet international investors in the forex markets and bond markets are happy to hold them, indeed they have many orders of magnitude more value than bitcoin. Users who just need a digital cash with bitcoin's properties will continue to use a permanantly-inflationary bitcoin fork for their remittances, online purchases and trading. But your dream of cryptographic sound money will be dead.
The way to keep the bitcoin money supply limit can't be economic, it must be cryptographic. So work towards a bitcoin economy backed by full nodes.

@_date: 2017-07-07 21:04:08
No that is not the entire foundation of bitcoin's security model. Miners are only trusted to choose the history of bitcoin transactions. All the other rules (like no double spending, no confiscation, etc) are enforced by entities via full nodes which actually use bitcoin as money.
If you read ahead in the paper instead of cherry picking you'll see this:


And anyway saying that miners already have the power to reverse transactions isn't an argument for giving them even more power.
It's very concerning that people are spreading misinformation and trying to modify the security model of bitcoin. Bitcoin's soundness as money is protected by *cryptography*. A private key is not merely a password to some database but *actual possession*. For example if a miner confiscates someone's bitcoins that transaction will be rejected as payment *because its not a valid bitcoin*, in the same way that a careful goldsmith rejects fool's gold.

The reason for this is that mining is zero-sum and any new people getting involved in mining takes away money from the existing miners. So existing miners have an incentive to downvote posts that say mining for regular people is possible.
This is bad for decentralization but unfortunately it happens. Bitcoin holders should fight against this, and especially stop spreading the story that *"mining is only for big boys, better that you just buy bitcoins directly instead"*.

The market makers offer up a range of coinjoin amounts they are willing to do. The coinjoin-initiator has chosen 1btc in that case and all the market makers copied him, the remainder simply goes to a change address (plus the earned fee). You can send any amount this way.
Here's another example with 6 participants where the amount was 0.95btc
The other 6 are coded to not merge their outputs again. There is little to no incentive to recode their bots. Plus the coinjoin-initiator could look at the UTXOs offered and check that bot doesn't have a history of remerging.

Long-term bitcoin requires fees to pay for mining as inflation drops to zero. People who use bitcoin as a store of value should love it when miner fees go up because it means their digital gold has a sustainable future. Until miner fees started going up about 12 months ago nobody had any idea whether the whole fees-replace-inflation thing would even work.
Also high fees means people's marginal utility of using bitcoin is at least that much. It's one of the strongest evidence that bitcoin is used for something beyond speculation. Right now people are paying ~390 sat/b for confirmation within 1 block.

But that method means you must already own all the bitcoins at the start and have them locked up. That's not how cash flow normally works, usually people have recurring payments soon after the day they get paid.
I think recurring payments similar to the kind that exist in banks would have to be built into a bitcoin wallet, where you set up a repeating payment and your wallet automatically sends an amount of bitcoin on a date you choose.

I completely respect you and the work you've done, but I believe technology has moved on. Specifically HD wallets have been developed.
I was talking to a bitcoin broker at my local meetup the other day.
He said he once sold btc to someone, he glanced at the blockchain and saw them go into an address along with many others. The total coins in the address added up to several hundred thousand GBP. Obviously an awful privacy breach. This broker told me he phoned up his customer to let him know.
That wouldn't have happened if the investor had used a new deposit address for each transaction, rather than a single address for everything. Obviously paper wallets are an important historical development in bitcoin, the wiki page should stay up only in case someone uncovers an old paper wallet. But they should no longer be used.
My view on the best way to store bitcoins on paper: Run the electrum wallet on a live operating system (such as Tails OS) Generate the HD wallet seed and write it down. Transfer the master public key and move it to an online computer, and use the generated receive addresses.

Satoshi left the bitcoin scene in 2010 which was long before the pro/anti on-chain scaling positions were codified.

My view is he realized that blockchains don't scale and must be limited, but it doesn't matter because as you say he's not our god.
It's not possible to compromise about hard forks, you can't hard fork just a little bit. What will probably happen is segwit will be activated with a UASF.

*"The internet is really fast!!!!111"*, except where it's not, such as in the data I linked on block propagation.

There's hundreds of Bitcoin ATM, and a massive network of localbitcoins traders. Yet there's no Ethereum ATMs or Litecoin ATMs, because it's much easier to simply buy bitcoin first and trade for whatever alt you want. Altcoin ATMs can't compete with that so they'll never be made.

That's not exactly right, it will be compatible if the UASF chain gets more work than any nonUASF chain. The same thing happens with BIP149 btw.

1. Once there is a difficulty retarget it all goes back to normal. Plus segwit is bigger blocks and also allows for LN.
2. You haven't addressed his point about antbleed. Allowing antbleed to continue allows one entity to get a disproportionate amount of mining power, destroying bitcoin's decentralization.
3. How did that work out for BU? It was a copypaste of Core and still managed to have regular catastrophic bugs.
4. Nope, because UASF is a soft fork the risks are asymmetric. All else equal investors will demand higher risk premiums for holding the nonUASF chain, and short sellers will push down the price in the hope of profitting from the reorg. Because hashpower closely follows price in cryptocurrencies, this will only make the reorg happen faster.

[Why sharding in a decentralized system is very hard](
Although I doubt this will stop vbuterin doing something and calling it sharding. The Ethereum developers have already proved they're ready to bail themselves out by imposing a hard fork on their currency, [as they did in the TheDAO fiasco.]( Ethereum users are routinely advised to switch off validation in their nodes which is why this hard fork went relatively smoothly. Say what you want about ETH but it is NOT a swiss bank account in your pocket, it is little different from Paypal in terms of trust.
Also, this thread was linked to the ethereum subreddit and is now filled with brigaders.

As I thought, that paper doesn't mention initial blockchain synchronization or block propagation between miners.
Propagation delays actually make money for large miners, and cost money for small miners. Propagation delays are always a centralizing force. Read this if you haven't already: 
If we rely on orphan cost then all miners will centralize into one physical location where they can transmit blocks instantly.

Miners don't vote or veto, they signal.
New consensus rules like soft forks are a question for full nodes, not miners. The block version thing is a signal that tells updated nodes to start enforcing the new rules. We wait for 95% signal to be almost certain that a blockchain fork won't happen.
But in theory, anything above 50% of miner support would be enough to signal the enforcement of new rules. The supporting miners could just orphan all non-signalling blocks. This is a drastic step with other consequences but it would work.

You're reading too much into this IMO. It's not about ideologies but about interests. The big blocker side don't really have any ideology except taking control of bitcoin for themselves, trying to make their own startups more profitable or trying to make the miner fee they pay go down.
I noticed in the other thread some bigblockers were saying *"actually we are libertarians"*, but when you prod and poke a bit they all still want you to trust some large faceless institution instead of being in control yourself.
The pro-decentralization side isn't about making people pay more in fees but about finding solutions where both decentralization *and* scale is possible. I've mentioned in the other thread about how layer-2 technology cuts through the scale/decentralization tradeoff.

@_date: 2016-05-24 13:16:42
I don't think it's possible to hard fork at a moment's notice.
So let's say the situation is, &gt;50% of the miners have been nationalized by the Communist Party of China at the stroke of a pen, and they are now attacking the currency (mining empty blocks for example)
A full node is in every Bitcoin ATM, every user of Armory, Bitcoin-Qt, JoinMarket, Electrum servers, marketplaces, exchanges, casinos and everything else. I'm sure a large amount of them just leave their node running and focus on other things. They're probably busy people who have many other things going on with their lives, they don't all read reddit or coindesk every day.
Full nodes don't have much time to update, the longer we go without a hard fork the more time bitcoin is totally unusable. If just a few of bitcoin's full nodes don't update in these crucial few hours or days, we get a damaging blockchain fork.
A new PoW also breaks all lightweight wallets that download block headers. So every Electrum wallet, every Multibit, Mycelium, Copay, HiveWallet, BitcoinWallet, BreadWallet. Everything except web wallets must be updated by the user to the new PoW algorithm.
It's a similar situation with democratic government, one reason it doesn't always work well is that most people are busy with their lives and aren't willing and able to read newspapers every day to follow the political situation. From what I see in bitcoin today, it's users are expected to do the same thing to save us from the centralized miners, but in a much shorter timescale with that takes everyone by surprise.
Much better would be a planned hard fork. We can set the date of the hard fork months or years in the future. Use Petertodd's coinvoting protocol for signalling. Everyone will have a long time to notice on all the bitcoin news sites whats happening, and the hard fork would go much more smoothly. But as you said, there's no way we'd get consensus (not least because we've got big blockers who see the miners as allies so would be against it)
If bitcoin is unable to do a fast nuclear hard fork, and it's unable to do a slow planned hard fork, then bitcoin is not able to defend itself against centralized miners and therefore is already dead. CMV.

This is complete bs. If it were true then the litecoins I linked to above would be gone.
Full nodes will always verify signatures, regardless of whether the transaction is segwit or non-segwit. If a miner tries to steal coins without knowing the private key then the bitcoin economy's full nodes will reject those invalid blocks in the same way a careful goldsmith rejects fool's gold.

UASF doesn't have to lead to a chain split. The more of the economic majority supports it the safer it will be.
There have been other chain splits resulting from soft forks before (notably the [bip66 accidental chain split]( And it all worked out okay, the only people that lost money were the miners who took part.
People have been balancing the risk of a chain split against the very real cost of miner fees going up. A few days ago people were recommended to pay 430(!!!!!!) satoshi-per-byte for a fast confirmation. So yes UASF has risks but doing nothing is pretty bad too.

Because blockchains don't scale. They are probably the least efficient data structure ever, their aim to make the system be low-trust, not to be efficient.
Any broadcast network has N^2 scaling so the only way to make it not break is to limit N. Also large blocks provide an incentive for larger miners to make money at the expense of small miners, which contributes to miner centralization. And finally for bitcoin to the inflation-free requires the miners to be funded by transaction fees, so block space must always be expensive to some extent.

Segwit does increase the size of blocks if that's what you're asking. At the time there was an alt-client called Bitcoin "Classic" which would have attempted a hard fork to 2MB blocks. Segwit's block increase was a compromise, people thought that the 2MB segwit blocks would make everyone happy. As it turned out the big blockers then moved the goalposts and started supporting Bitcoin Unlimited.
I would personally prefer segwit to not have a block size increase but if the segwit-with-increase activates then that's good too.

Bitcoin should hard fork to a new PoW algorithm to return us to 2012 levels of decentralization with GPUs.
The network spends more than $1 million every day on the miners. Despite that mining is [terribly centralized]( providing barely any security against actors who could seize or coerce the mining hardware. Bitcoin only has value if it's decentralized, I believe it's in the rational self-interest of the economy backed by full nodes to hard fork to a new PoW.
When new ASICs become created for the new PoW, the bitcoin economy majority should simply hard fork again.

Sorry but you're describing a completely different system to how bitcoin actually works today.
The thing that makes bitcoin sound money is that anybody without too much difficulty can *verify for themselves* that all the rules of bitcoin are followed. Anything which breaks these rules is rejected for payment in the same way a careful goldsmith rejects fool's gold. Full nodes are the careful goldsmiths of bitcoin and we shouldn't make it harder to access them.
We already have a money system disciplined by the market. When central banks start printing the foreign exchange rate for their currency might go down a bit, but they obviously don't care. We saw how the fed expanded the monetary base by several orders of magnitude with QE and the value of the dollar did not crater.
Bitcoin's soundness as money is protected by *cryptography*. A private key is not merely a password to some third-party database but *actual possession*.
@_date: 2017-05-08 01:23:57
Not many things, decentralization is a major way that bitcoin stops requiring much trust, especially decentralization of mining and decentralization of verification (full node wallets)

A full node verifies all the rules of bitcoin for you. Rules like *"a coin can only be spent once"*, *"a coin can only be spent by the private keys holder"*, *"no creating coins out of nothing except by miners in a strict inflation schedule"*.
Using a full node wallet is like checking that your gold is the real thing before accepting it for payment. A lightweight wallet like Electrum introduces trust, you must trust a third-party server to tell you these things and it could in-theory lie to you and slip you fake bitcoins.

There's more to it than that. Also addresses are linked together in transaction graphs. If you subscribe to an address that spent to an output address and change, then only follow the change address, any eavesdropper will easily see that the change address belongs to you and the output address to somebody else.

bitcoind is the only solution when doing this kind of work.
you would either create all the addresses with bitcoind's internal wallet (using getreceiveaddress) or separately create addresses from some kind of HD wallet and import them into bitcoind. Make sure each user can generate a new deposit address if they need to.
To track how much coins in total you have the command is getbalance.
Just run 'help' on the RPC terminal of bitcoin core and it tells you all the commands. Also look up how to use walletnotify and blocknotify, for your software to get notifications for when events in your bitcoin wallet happen.

UASF BIP148 is a way of activating an update to bitcoin called segwit, [which has a number of benefits](
So far, segwit activation is being blocked by one big miner because it would break one of their patents ([see this writeup for the whole story]( The BIP148 method works around this one miner, but it requires more co-ordination from the bitcoin economy, such as this an exchange like this making announcements that they'll support BIP148.

I think this is the most important reason.
Tradition. It shouldn't be overstated, in troubled times people will generally always believe gold has some value. It's an asset you can cling to when others break down. If government-issued currencies break down.
So for example at the start of the Spanish Civil War, the republican side used the spanish gold reserves were used to buy weapons from the USSR.  They had nothing else, their counterparties accepted gold and they needed arms to fight the war.
In my view this is the main feature that bitcoin cant replace, even government-issued currencies don't have this. Whether that's enough to make you hold a substantial amount of gold in these times of relative peace is a different question.
@_date: 2015-10-13 12:03:03
Are you Nejc Kodrič ? I assume that is why bitstamp is absent from the list of participating exchanges.
What you describe already happens but slower. The bot selling into the rising price on C could hold the price down, but only for a short while until more coins arrive. If there's too much supply the price is going down sidechain or no sidechain.
This sidechain could benefit bitcoin's value by making it more liquid. Meaning someone could buy and sell easier and without moving the price as much. Liquidity is important for any currency and makes it more useful and thus valuable. See the March 2010 equities flash crash as an example of what happens when liquidity disappears.

Larger blocks make it harder to run a full node. Bitcoin's security assumptions rely on [most of the economy]( using a full node for their transactions, otherwise miners could print infinite bitcoins or do other bad stuff. To start up a new full node you need to download and validate the entire blockchain which gets harder and slower as more blocks are added. Although full nodes have [many benefits to the user]( we still see their usage stalling and this is worrying.
Larger block also slow down block propagation. Near 10% of all blocks are generated in less than a minute. 5% are generated in under 30 seconds. So any delay in propagation can severely eat into a miner's margins and encourage them to centralize. Get more details on block generation timing here: 
I agree mining is awfully centralized today. But I don't see that as a reason to make the problem any worse. I know it's a very controversial view but I believe [the bitcoin economy should hard fork to a new PoW algorithm to fix miner centralization](

Yes that is what I am arguing. (And luke-jr too apparently)
You may use the centralized relay networkk but if gets attacked one day and it stops working, then big miners will have a big advantage over small miners and that will be a strong centralizing force. That's not acceptable to bitcoin's investors who see value in decentralization and it's a big reason why the block size limit was not raised like some miners wanted. The centralizing forces are still there at 1MB and the only reason the limit isn't lowered is politics.

I suppose you're right that criminals also might make use of it. But I don't think it helps them as much as you think. Here's why.
Criminals often have a very lucrative business model, to get privacy they can just run their money through a series of semi-sham high cashflow gambling businesses for a 50% cut, they can afford the cost of seeking out and interfacing with these seedy services... Regular uses like Joe and Jane doe? Their names are up in neon on blockchain.info. It might not seem great to them, but if there a high cost of fixing it they simply won't, because the cost of fixing it is very concrete and the cost or privacy loss is speculative and distant. They might just need to give up bitcoin and switch to something almost totally private: cash... Regular users need efficient and inexpensive privacy if it is to help them at all.

Not in large amounts. The standard 12.5kg bars so-called Good Delivery bars usually come with a unique stamp and certificate. If they are lacking this they cannot be traded at large bullion brokers like the London Bullion Market.
If a bar were to get stolen, its serial number could be traced and important markets would no longer accept it. Your only hope then is to melt it down into many smaller coins, or sell it cheaply overseas to some Russians or Saudis.
So no, gold is not necessarily more fungible than bitcoin. If you've been paid with gold bars you may find you have to mix them, only gold mixing is far more expensive than bitcoin mixing. In practice you check the serial number is stamped on the bar and it has a certificate.

JoinMarket is an open source decentralized bitcoin privacy project. The software runs on your own hardware. It works using the CoinJoin protocol. The private keys never your computer so nobody can steal your coins. The decentralization means there is no one entity who can spy on you.
Other mixing services mix your coins with other users, resulting in you getting back coins possibly related to drugs, stolen money or other practices you might not want to be involved in. This is highly undesirable if you just don't want your employer knowing which non-profits you support from your salary. Because of the incentives of JoinMarket, you have access to a huge amount of clean, untainted bitcoins to mix with at a very low price. Many of the bitcoins you're mixing with will be bought from regulated exchanges, owned by normal holders of bitcoin.
Not to mention you'd likely be paying lower fees for mixing than other centralized services, because of the competition between willing-to-wait coinjoiners. Indeed if you don't mind waiting, you can wait around with a low offer fee and maybe another impatient coinjoiner will join with you.

But it can sybil attack coinjoins.
It could be ordered to watch for particular UTXOs and if they get posted for a coinjoin then stop all other UTXOs and replace them with only the server's own. The coinjoin would get confirmed but in reality the server would know exactly which output has the coins.

The random phrase is converted to a big number. That number is used as a seed to generate a sequence of private keys. Given the same seed, the same sequence of private keys will always be generated.
As Electrum told you, you should write down this random phrase on a piece of paper and keep it safe. You can use it recover your wallet if you ever lose it, but if anyone else finds it they can use it to steal all your coins.
Electrum's wallet.dat file contains an encrypted version of that seed (which is why it asks for an encryption passphrase). That file also contains metadata like labels and payment requests. The file normally lives in ~/.electrum/wallets on Linux and %APPDATA%\electrum\ on Windows

For the Systemic Sybil attack, values like 800 BTC are not the cost. Those coins are not used up, and the adversary still has them after the attack. They could sell them or otherwise recover the value. Also their value can be hedged like what some miners do, so there can be little volatility risk for bitcoin's price.
So the real cost is the time-value-of-money of those coins, if we take the time value to be 0.2% per annum (nobody knows the true value but this is a fair guess) then the cost of that attack is 800 BTC * 0.2% = **1.6 BTC per annum**, which is a much lower number. (Although hedging costs would increase that value a bit, and miner fees as you say)
A targeted sybil attack by the coordinator is possible as has been said. I don't know of a solution as it seems to inherently come from centralization of the coordinator. I'll think a bit more about trying to detect sybil attacks by analysing the transactions.

Exponential functions and the concept of percentage inflation seems to be overlooked by many.
Yes in the year 2060 some bitcoins will be created, but the miner reward will be just 0.012 btc per block, the amount of existing already-existing bitcoin will be 20.995 million and that works out to an inflation rate of 0.0001% or basically zero. And that's only the year 2060.
Today bitcoin inflation is below 4% and three out of every four bitcoins that will ever exist has already been mined. The era of low inflation is already here.

A good analysis of the debate.
The great thing about segwit is it can lead to technology like LN which cuts through the scale/decentralization tradeoff. With layer-2 tech we can have both adoption _and_ decentralization. So ask yourself, why are bigblockers stopping it from happening?  LN also provides instant payments which make bitcoin usable for in-person purchases, they also take payments off-chain which greatly improves privacy. And BTW jgarzik who is writing code for the segwit2x hard fork happens to [own a coin-tracking startup]( I wonder if that explains all the lies he's been spreading about LN.
BTW another aspect of decentralization is miner decentralization. Bigger blocks give a disproportionate advantage to bigger miners which is a centralizing effect. This is on top of the running-nodes-at-home point. See this blog post that explains the miner centralization:

On Linux OS randomness comes from `/dev/urandom` which I reckon is sufficient for the job. It's also used to generate SSH keys, SSL certificates and other important things.
I don't see a reason why the RNG of hardware wallets would be any better than software wallets. If anything the Linux source code has seen far more review than hardware wallets.
The real solution if randomness is under suspicion is to use a multisig wallet with each private key generated by a different wallet (hardware or software) so all of them need to be compromised in order for you to lose money.

Bitcoin needs on-chain fees to support the miners as inflation goes to zero. That's a fact that has been known about since 2009.

Change outputs are also _never_ combined with coinjoin outputs from the same transaction, that's the point of the separate bip32 branches.
Also, the tumbler script pays people with coinjoin outputs not change outputs, so if someone just paid you with a tumbler script you wouldn't be able to trace back using change outputs. The reason is that you got paid with coinjoin outputs, not change outputs.


It does not. A sweep coinjoin only uses inputs from one mixdepth.

LN doesn't use hubs. Hub-and-spokes is a scheme that predates LN and isn't related.
LN is not like using a bank because there's no counterparty risk, the payment channels can't steal your money.
Of course you can only spend up to the amount you have, all money works this way.
The point of LN is that payments can be routed so with a reasonably-well connected network you can send and receive from anyone in it.

Your wallet should show them as having not moved. Some wallets hide the coins if there's an unconfirmed transaction spending them, but in reality they haven't gone anywhere until they get confirmations.

UASF isn't about counting nodes. UASF works by having a large part of the [economic majority]( say they will enforce the rules of a new soft fork. So then the full nodes used by exchanges, traders and holders as wallets have far more importance than a full node on a VPS somewhere.

You use an uncompressed pubkey as an argument. Segwit stuff only allows compressed pubkeys, so perhaps the `addmultisigaddress` method then falls back to non-segwit.


Segwit inputs need to be signed by putting the scriptSig in the witness part of the transaction. Legacy doesnt use a seperated witness.


You follow the rules of segwit to see whether a given input needs to be spent with segwit or not. See bip141

*   (3min watch time) Have a watch of this, tell me what you think. Especially the part about the comparison of a string and an integer which always resulted false so the crypto API was never invoked, not even once. [Have a look at nullc's comments in this thread on the matter too](
* Yes that is true. Though if you're happy to store keys on a hard drive then you may as well just store the wallet.dat files. You'd avoid the issues with raw privkeys then.
* Yes that's true right now, but there's no guarantees over time. For example as people moved to segwit there was a segwit paper wallet generator which resulted in some guy getting his coins stuck and needing to ask reddit for what to do.

It's not about the crypto libraries but about how the javascript language makes review so difficult that a piece of code that was widely used in bitcoin javascript stuff had a critical bug which existed for years. There was a comparison between an integer and a string, which always resulted in false so securerandom was never used.

Bitcoin's blockchain technology has a tradeoff between scale and decentralization. Bitcoin's creator coded in a parameter which limits the size of blocks. This means blockchain space is a scarce commodity and a market arises for using it. Transactors pay fees to the miners and this fee market allocates the scarce blockchain space. This fee income to miners is what will give them an incentive to keep mining as bitcoin's inflation goes to zero.
Core is a loose group of developers and testers who collaborate to work on bitcoin. When there was debate about this issue between 2013 and 2015 some prominent core developers gave their arguments, so the [position of keeping bitcoin decentralized]( came to be known as the pro-core side.
There are three groups of people I see who are against Core's vision.
1. People who have businesses that depend on blockchain space being very cheap (people who want to store data on the blockchain, people who want to make lots of microtransactions on-chain instead of using an off-chain solution, spies who want every transaction to be visible to everyone so they can collect data on people)
2. Bitmain mining hardware manufacturer, who have a patented ASICBOOST algorithm that would be broken by the segwit update. They try to stop segwit being activated and that means being anti-core.
3. People who don't like bitcoin and want it to fail. So altcoin owners like vbuterin or leftists like jstolfi for whom bitcoin goes against their vision of society.

Agreed, ETH doesn't actually have any merchants. It's entirely speculative with no real economy backing it, so any nodes being left behind are not actually important.
Bitcoin by comparison has a full node in every Bitcoin ATM scattered around the world. Much harder to update and more damaging if they get left behind in any attempted hard fork.

Bitcoin should hard fork to a new PoW algorithm to return us to 2012 levels of decentralization with GPUs.
The network spends more than $1 million every day on the miners. Despite that mining is [terribly centralized]( providing barely any security against actors who could seize or coerce the mining hardware. Bitcoin only has value if it's decentralized, I believe it's in the rational self-interest of the economy backed by full nodes to hard fork to a new PoW.
When new ASICs become created for the new PoW, the bitcoin economy majority should simply hard fork again.
Bitcoin is under attack by it's miners. The economy must not allow itself to be pushed around. New PoW Now!

Bitcoin is P2P electronic cash that is valuable over legacy systems because of the monetary autonomy it brings to its users through decentralization. Bitcoin seeks to address the root problem with conventional currency: all the trust that's required to make it work--
-- Not that justified trust is a bad thing, but trust makes systems brittle, opaque, and costly to operate. Trust failures result in systemic collapses, trust curation creates inequality and monopoly lock-in, and naturally arising trust choke-points can be abused to deny access to due process. Through the use of cryptographic proof and decentralized networks Bitcoin minimizes and replaces these trust costs.

I hang around on reddit, IRC, stackexchange and few other portals, and I've seen money being lost due to handling raw private keys and change addresses happen more than a dozen times.
The change address issue happens when a user imports a private key into a wallet and then spends part of the balance. They expect the paper wallet to have the rest of the balance, so they delete the software wallet. The rest of the balance is actually in a change address which has been deleted.
As well as this issue there's also the javascript cryptography issue, the printer issue, the low error-correction problem, the encouragement of centralized validation, the fact that they all seem to come from websites instead of software on your own computer.
From what I see, *virtually all* bitcoin developers agree that paper wallets are best avoided. From my point of view it's no more biased than if a medical website recommends not smoking.
Note that I'm not talking about any paper backup like a seed phrase, the only dangerous aspect is using these single-address website-generated things. If someone wants to store bitcoins for a long time as you said, seed phrases are much safer. They don't have to be from hardware wallets either, they can be cold storage wallets or multisig wallets instead.
Regarding the private key format; with the slow adoption of segwit addresses there's not much guarantee that old privkey formats will always work. Even today it's not possible to take a privkey from Bitcoin Core and import it into blockchain.info. We've already had someone [have trouble recovering their money]( because they used a "segwit paper wallet".

1. I'm not aware of any case where this actually happens. It seems developers who are aware of the usefulness of HD wallets don't code paper wallet software.
1. I've never seen any paper wallet sites which warn about this. That means there are no "decent paper wallets" which is kind of my point.
1. It's not about easy or hard to write, but the amount of error correction. If a single character is wrong or becomes unreadable then the privkey of a paper wallet can't be imported, not so for a seed phrase. It's easy to correct the word "abanbon".
1. Agreed. This point is not in the wiki page
You haven't replied to the point about full node validation. If you have a paper wallet lying around, and want to check whether it was ever used, then you need to wait for a wallet rescan on Core (which is also not compatible with pruning, and takes a long long time). If you want to check another paper wallet you need to rescan *again*. Sure you could import them all before but it's not very user-friendly and I bet people won't bother, instead they'll use centralized blockchain explorers. HD wallets by contrast can generate all their addresses at the start and so are more compatible with full nodes and rescans.

Bitcoin itself doesn't need to know your name or any details from you to use it. It's like digital cash in that respect.
On the other hand it means if you lose your phone and don't have a backup, your bitcoins are gone for good. Mycelium has a feature where you write down 12 words on paper and they are enough to backup your entire wallet. So do that before you put any larger amounts of money there.

You realise all of bitcoin is artificial? There's nothing natural about it, it was made by some guy in 2009.
Next they'll be saying the 21 million money supply limit should be raised because it's "artificial". (Big blockers will now get very offended, but I've never heard a proper argument why this line of reasoning doesn't apply)
We've just had a halvening event so now the miners are running at just 4% inflation. More than 3 out of every 4th bitcoin has already been mined, we're quickly moving to a regime where transaction fees are taking over from inflation. So yes, now is the time for miner fees to trend upwards.

Bitcoin is an engineering project, which involves tradeoffs and compromises. You could easily ask same question for the 21 million money supply, 10 minute block interval, 4 year halving interval, etc
The block size must be something finite and reasonably small otherwise bitcoin won't stay decentralized, and it won't be able to fund it's miners after inflation drops to low levels. We just had a halving where inflation dropped to 4%, we're right on schedule to start funding the miners with transaction fees instead of new bitcoins.


*"Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded"*
Fact is there's a lot of spam out there. Bitcoin is a digital currency, not a low-cost data storage solution. I personally can't wait for [crap]( like [this]( to be priced out, which force every node in the network to store and relay (often unprunable) trivialities.
There's also a lot of understandable inefficiencies in how the blockchain is used, which now have an incentive to be fixed:  and 


Well investing is risky. Go buy treasury bills if you want something safe and boring.
Fact is people are buying and holding bitcoin, the exchange rate has gone up by near [300% in the last 12 months that the block size debate has been going on.](
And every time a hostile hard fork threatened, [the market sold off](
Along with the [non-fakable opposition to a hard fork]( it's pretty clear that the economic majority and investors are fully behind Bitcoin Core's scaling plan.


An interesting view where a blockchain hard fork, forcing every full node to upgrade in a short time at the risk of *killing the currency* is portrayed as "sticking with the current system".
[We have enough data to know that even 1mb could be too much]( and how the system only survives today because of a huge amount of scaling work by developers.

Mycelium is a wallet, it allows you to hold bitcoins on your own computer. Probably what you'd do is withdraw your coins to your own wallet so they're in your possession, then send them to a currency exchange when you want to trade them for your local currency.
What you need is a currency exchange, not a bank. Some institutions might be both of those things but currency exchange is what you need.
Check if you live near a Bitcoin ATM:

I made this graph because it always helps when explaining ideas. Those parameters S, B, M define a curve of what fee rate will be used for a given block height since first broadcasting. I'll call it a "fee rate curve".
The red and orange curves have the same starting fee and waiting time, but red is more willing to pay a higher fee. So they're both hopeful to get the cheaper fee rates mined and willing to wait the same time, but red is willing to pay higher if required.
Purple and green have the same ending fee and waiting time, but purple has a higher starting fee. So they're both willing to pay and wait the same in worst case, but green is more hopeful about getting the cheap fee rates mined.

But this only leaks the change output. The coinjoin outputs have improved privacy? An adversary can't tell which coinjoin outputs belong to which inputs.

You can still run a node but not accept incoming connections, by configuring with -listen=0. Alternatively you can run tor on the same machine and Bitcoin Core will automatically create it's own .onion to accept connections.
Then you can use your node as a wallet and be able to use bitcoin in a trustless way. Without running your own full node you can never be sure that the miners haven't printed infinite bitcoins or broken any other rules of bitcoin.

Perhaps the paper contains the 12 words but also has printed the first 6 receive addresses along with a message explaining more addresses can be generated? Maybe each address has a 'used' tickbox next to it for the person to tick off every time?

A "paper wallet" if thats what you're thinking of is very unsafe. See

Money can move in channels in both direction. So even if you get into a situation where a channel becomes unbalanced where all the money is on one side, it's still possible to make a payment in the other direction which would rebalance it.
In fact the automated LN channel opening scheme will also partly aim to create triangles of channels, then it becomes possible to make a payment to yourself in a big loop which rebalances all those channels.
Also, just because a channel became unbalanced doesn't mean it need to be closed and a miner fee paid.

The bitcoin community on reddit has had something of a schism related to the value of a constant in the source code called MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.
It comes down to two different visions of what bitcoin should be. One side wants bitcoin to be something like a digital gold which focuses on the decentralized currency aspect. The other side wants bitcoin to be a high-volume payment method a bit like the Visa card network with much less emphasis on the currency aspect.
The bitcoin-as-digital-gold view is strong in r/bitcoin, the bitcoin-as-high-volume-payment-network is strong in r/btc. Both subreddits have fairly strong moderation and heavily downvote the other side, that's how escalated the tensions are.
Also, u/theymos is a bitcoin early adopter who is the head mod of r/bitcoin and was very vocal in advocating the bitcoin-as-digital-gold view and setting the moderation rules of r/bitcoin, so he's somewhat of a lightning rod of people's fears and frustrations.

But that requires a rescan, which takes **ages**. And is not compatible with pruning.
If you realize you want to spend another paper wallet then you have to rescan *again*.
HD wallets, by contrast, have all addresses rescanned at once.
I am aware of the new rpc call `scantxoutset` but that only tells you the unspent balance, not the history of an address. So users might end up accidentally using an address twice because of it.

Writing down a private key yourself on paper has terrible error correction. If even one letter is wrong (maybe because you folded the paper) then the private key wont decrypt or be imported. Unlike with seed phrases where the natural language words have way more error correction just because they're actual words we use every day.

Bitcoin is designed with privacy in mind so that kind of thing is very hard to measure even today. But a lot of the stuff I followed (traffic figures on various sites, bid/ask spreads, number of ads on localbitcoins, that kind of stuff) did hold steady or rise.
I just remembered that I started coding JoinMarket in late 2014 / early 2015 when the bear market was at its lowest. So me and a few others saw the value in a private currency even if the market apparently didn't.
As others have already mentioned in this thread, in bear market bottoms only the real hardcore are left so it was actually a fairly nice term in terms of people you talked to.

No idea why this got downvoted, this is the best answer here.
An anonymous web wallet is not possible. The best kind of anonymity must involve downloading the entire blockchain, otherwise a third party like the Electrum server could learn what addresses are yours.
Luckily you don't need to *store* the entire blockchain, if you enable pruning your disk space shouldn't go above about 2gb.

A reminder of u/luke-jr's [view of why the block weight/size should be reduced](






For me personally, I'd say an *increase of the block interval* would be even better. It would still result in a smaller growth of the blockchain but also improve the situation with latency.
If the average block interval were something like 2 hours instead of 10 minutes then mining over Tor would become easy. As of today, mining over Tor is completely uncompetitive. Bitcoin's only value comes from its decentralization and the ability of miners to hide is essential to that.
The block interval can be increased with a soft fork, it could be a UASF one day. (Provided it has support from the economy)

Every so often a newb user will post here asking for advice on how to store bitcoins. Some people will reply telling them to use paper wallets.
We who are knowledgeable about bitcoin cannot stay silent on this any longer. It's time to really make everyone aware just how bad and dangerous paper wallets are. They have lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost bitcoin. The [bitcoin wiki page linked in the OP]( explains all the problems of paper wallets in gory detail. Their flaws cannot be fixed even by expert users, except by simply not using them.
I'm *not* talking about "seed phrases" or "mnemonic phrase" where the bitcoin wallet generates 12/24 random words which the user writes down. Seed phrases are perfectly safe, and in fact are one of the best ways to store bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-22 11:06:00
* bitaddress.org would generate those private keys with javascript.
* Writing down private keys does not have much error correction, if a single character is wrong or becomes unreadable then the privkey can't be imported. Seed phrases have far more error correction (because if you meant to write the word "abandon" and instead wrote "abanbon" then its fairly easy to correct that).
* You haven't mentioned spending in your procedure. Spending from individual privkeys has caused many people to lose money because of the change address issue or accidentally paying too much miner fees. Also we tell people to use full nodes but that's difficult for those 3 individual privkeys.
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:39:01

Non-cooperation would be for example if the other side refuses to sign off a transaction from the 2-of-2 multisig address. You would then need to wait for a timeout before you can recover your coins.
There's a strong disincentive for the other side to do this, so you'd be protected by game theory economic reasoning just like with the rest of bitcoin. But it still could happen.

There is no way except in the way that all addresses can lose privacy, which is if your send them to a blockchain explorer or other centralized lookup server.
So in the Ledger example then Ledger's web wallet could see all your addresses. Although you could avoid that by connecting the Ledger to Electrum wallet and then pointing Electrum to your own Electrum server. You'd need to generate a brand new wallet because the Ledger website still knows your old addresses that you previously sent to it.
It's the same for paper wallets, most people just check their balance on a blockchain explorer website.

The way to do this is for every wallet, exchange, marketplace, casino, etc to allow the user to configure which unit they want to see. Electrum wallet for example already allows you to choose BTC, mBTC or bits.

Well that's impossible with current technology. Increasing the block size adds to centralization pressure, which would destroy the main feature that makes bitcoin valuable.

Paper wallets still encourage address reuse and raw transactions, which has lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars being lost.

The point of mining is bitcoin is to allow the network to come to a consensus on the history and ordering of bitcoin transactions.
So if you've got a digital coin, you might try to spend it twice. Only one of those spends can be valid, and mining is needed to choose which one.

Bitcoin is risky in some respects, but that's not an argument for making the risk worse IMO.
I don't think the "scrubbing knowledge" thing is true, because the old version of the wiki page is always preserved in the history. So any historian can always find it. But newbs hopefully won't.
Coming back to the discussion about whether to put instructions for creating paper wallets on the wiki. If people have already decided to create paper wallets then the instructions would help them, but my concern is the instructions themselves act as encouragement to create paper wallets. Maybe it could be done by having the section start with big red letters saying something like "Even though the instructions are here, don't actually do this".
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:10:39

That procedure wouldn't prove that paper wallets are safe, it just proves that in that one situation the risks did not come to pass. That's like having a situation where you encrypted your messages to a friend with ROT13, and nobody read your messages, therefore ROT13 must be a perfectly secure encryption algorithm.
I don't think the abstinence-only sex education analogy is true, because humans are not evolutionarily programmed through millions of years to create paper wallets.

When you spend from them make sure you are aware of how change addresses work.
A common situation is the user, following common paper wallet instructions, boots into tails (an ephemeral linux distribution that doesn't persistently save any data, used to avoid some host malware), imports their key, and then sends *some* of its funds. They then turn off the computer. Change goes to an address *inside* the wallet, but the wallet is destroyed right after. Unfortunately paper wallet sites don't really tell the user about this, so people have learn about it from reddit.
Another danger is that the keys were made by javascript. But I guess if they haven't been stolen yet then they won't be.
Also you should ideally make sure to avoid address reuse. Though thats privacy rather than security, but privacy loss can still be a security risk, and again paper wallet sites give no warnings.
Finally, for security you should use a full node wallet when checking whether funds have been received into the paper wallets, but their design makes that not very user friendly.
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:16:32
It's more than just preference, it's evidence. We've got lots of evidence that paper wallets have lead to loss of money and are generally a bad idea. There's a writeup here

I don't know why this is so difficult to understand. Many many people have lost money because of paper wallets, the fact that you didn't doesn't change things. I also haven't seen any credible arguments replying to the points about problematic printers, encouraging address reuse, change address loss, low error correction, encouragement of centralized validation, javascript cryptography, etc
Let's pick on the centralized validation. We regularly tell people to use full node wallets for privacy and security, yet single-address paper wallets are designed in such a way that it's very hard to use a full node with them. A great benefit of HD wallets is they fit well with blockchain rescanning procedures.

How high do miner fees have to get before UASF is deemed the safer option, will we have this conversation again at 1000 sat/b and 5000 sat/b?
At the end of the day they're a big bitcoin company and I'm just an open source dev enthusiast who codes for fun.

This weekend has seen transactions with very cheap miner fees getting confirmed (1 sat/b), yet fee estimation algorithms often still show much more expensive fee rates (because they're based on confidence intervals and other subtleties)
The blog post advocates another way of handling miner fees. In theory this method should work better than fee estimating because it uses present information rather than past information.
A further issue with fee estimating algorithms is miners will always try to manipulate them, which may or may not work but will result in an arms race between algorithm developers and miners. Here is a case where a miner attempted it: 
Also SPV wallets must consult centralized services to get their fee estimation from, if miners somehow controlled this they could manipulate the price of block space and make people pay more. The method in the OP doesn't have this problem.

The [wiki page I linked]( seems to show that the majority of core devs actually prefer BIP148. We've already seen vocal support for it from Luke-Jr, Eric Lombrozo, Gregory Sanders on twitter/reddit and other channels.
My view of the situation is that users and businesses ([on top of the already-supporting ones]( should express their support for BIP148 if they want it to happen. Core devs don't actually have much power in terms of economic majority. Businesses are a major group being hurt by high miner fees so I'm slightly confused at why some of them seem so reluctant.

Bitcoin is not a religion and Satoshi is not our jesus. From my point of view bitcoin aims to be P2P electronic cash that is valuable over legacy systems because of the monetary autonomy it brings to its users through decentralization. Anything that helps that aim is good, regardless of who said it.
Note that Satoshi also warned about hard forks, he said *Don't use this patch, it'll make you incompatible with the network, to your own detriment.*
Followed two months later by, *"Piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale. [...] Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices."*
Whats more you could scale to Visa levels without having every transaction be on the blockchain, that's what Lightning Network is about.

Regarding mobile wallets that easily sweep paper wallets, have you considered how they work? Mobile wallet sweeping works by querying a centralized blockchain explorer, which can then easily spy on the user and lie to them.

Long term, bitcoin *requires* full blocks to function for a number of reasons including: fee sniping, keeping nodes decentralized, keeping mining decentralized, providing income to miners as inflation goes to zero.
And lightning transactions *are* bitcoin transactions. They are denominated in the bitcoin currency and if they get broadcast they will be mined into the bitcoin blockchain.

With JoinMarket you can get a riskless return of about 1% per year for 1 BTC. Let's say 0.7% when you include power and your time.
We're currently at about block 420,000, so the block 10,000,000 happens in about (10000000 - 420000) / (6 * 24 * 356) = 187 years
So decay 1btc by 0.7% per year for 187 years to get the equivalent future value (1 - 0.007)**187 = 0.26884964 btc. So I'd give you just over a quarter of a bitcoin for that.
This doesn't take into account the insane risk of holding bitcoin for nearly two centuries. 0.26884964 is the maximum I could possibly give you, because any more and I'd be better off just sticking it in joinmarket.

High miner fees means people's marginal utility of using bitcoin is at least that much. It's one of the strongest evidence that bitcoin is used for something beyond speculation.
Long-term bitcoin requires fees to pay for mining as inflation drops to zero. People who use bitcoin as a store of value (i.e. those who have the most influence on price) should love it when miner fees go up because it means their digital gold has a sustainable future. Until miner fees started going up about 18 months ago nobody had any idea whether the whole fees-replace-inflation thing would even work.

These don't work in adversarial condition. And mining is an adversarial condition, big miners can make more profit for themselves and cost small miners money by breaking any scheme like compact blocks or FIBRE.
Compact blocks are exist today in bitcoin core were didn't even have the aim of reducing block latency.


I don't know. Good to see you support segwit, hopefully you'll stop concern trolling about LN whenever segwit is mentioned then.


This still introduces trust into the system. If everyone used only these then miners could create fake UTXOs and print more than 21 million bitcoins. You still need most of the economic majority doing the initial sync.


I'm not aware of it but it will be interesting to see how it deals with the block propagation issues, given that miners _today_ are already forced to use centralized solutions like FIBRE.


This could be made more secure by comparing the blockchain tips. If your full node influences your wallet then I'd say it is economic.


I don't know notable anyone on this sub who's said that. Of course it's not about more or less nodes, it's about the economic majority. People want to be able to verify that all the rules of bitcoin are being followed without trusting anyone else, otherwise bitcoin really would be nothing more than Paypal 2.0. Private keys should actually be a claim to possession and not just a fancy password for a database somewhere. Today many bitcoin businesses just connect to centralized block explorer APIs or use a payment processor, so many people say we can't trust businesses to keep bitcoin sound.
Most people I know would be happy with larger blocks if fraud proofs were a mature technology, but holding up segwit as a political manoeuvre to try to get hard fork bigger blocks is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it's suspected the true reason for the holdup is ASICBOOST.

Good post but I think the danger of other cryptocurrencies replacing is overstated. All cryptocurrencies use blockchains and if they get anywhere close to the amount of users bitcoin has then they'll run into exactly the same scalability issues and face the same tradeoff between scale and decentralization. Remember that Ethereum is so centralized that it's developers were able to get away with a hard fork that bailed themselves out of a badly-written contract (google TheDAO hard fork). 
@_date: 2018-12-22 12:04:48
Paper wallets go further than preference. I've been in an IRC channel and personally witnessed dozens of people who have lost money because of paper wallets. Threads like that appear on this subreddit fairly often. I don't know if you've been in a position regularly support people using bitcoin. The advice against paper wallets isn't one that people came to naturally-- they seem neat-- but one that has arisen out of experience.
In terms of bitcoin developers: [In this very thread nullc says paper wallets are bad]( On twitter we have [Pieter Wuille retweeting a post of mine about paper wallets]( It was also [liked by luke-jr]( nullc in particular has posted a lot on this thread.
Then there's the point about paper wallets not being easily compatible with full nodes. Let's not forget that we had a very dangerous situation between 2015-2017 where bitcoin was nearly taken over by Segwit2X and where the UASF with full nodes was the only way to resist attacking miners.
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:29:40
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:25:07
Ethereum node software has flags which are on by default and which disable most of the checks, that's what exchanges/etc run. They are nodes but they're not fully-verifying nodes. That's why TheDAO rollback bailout (see r/ethereumfraud/) was so easy to do for ethereum developers. That's why its a centralized system which slows the utter failure of larger blocks.
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:47:36
My only bias is helping the bitcoin ecosystem.
I've been working on the bitcoin wiki for a while now: 
The reason the instructions on how to make a paper wallet were removed is because there is no safe way to make paper wallets. They are best avoided entirely.
IMO the Core devs were right to refuse your PR because it would still encourage address reuse, raw transactions, centralized validation. It would still have low error correction compared to seed phrase words.
There also isn't a standard way to serialize private keys either. Here is at least [one example]( of someone who nearly lost their money because the format for private keys was changed. Hopefully seed phrases will become more standardized over time, but I doubt people will work on standardizing paper wallets because they are such a bad solution.
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:26:03
It would be very slow. There's an old thread somewhere on bitcointalk of a discussion of doing EC calculations by hand. Doing hashes by hand is not possible at all IIRC.
A more user-friendly way is probably to use an offline computer to do the calculations.
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:47:58
If you're using CLI then its already not very user-friendly and I'd say we can't expect non-technical people to do it. And then you have to put together the document ready for printing (and make sure the printer doesn't leak your keys, and all the other stuff)
Yes you can educate people into avoiding address reuse, but the education hasn't been working well. We can also nudge them away from it using deterministic wallets and software interfaces that discourage address reuse.
The OP has discussion on the full node issue:  It comes down to how if you have a paper wallet lying around, and want to check whether it was ever used, then you need to wait for a wallet rescan on Core (which is also not compatible with pruning). If you want to check another paper wallet you need to rescan again. Sure you could import them all before but it's not very user-friendly and I bet people won't bother, instead they'll use centralized blockchain explorers. I am aware of the new rpc call *scantxoutset* but that only tells you the unspent balance, not the history of an address. So users might end up accidentally using an address twice because of it.
Have a look at the history of [this paper wallet address]( We can see the owner regularly buying bitcoin between April 2014 and January 2017, before apparently making a mistake with raw transactions and sending **50 bitcoins as miner fees**. The terrible privacy from address reuse is the only reason we can see in public what happened. I don't want any more losses like this to happen so that's why I posted this thread. It's so easy and much safer to just write down 12 random words that your wallet generates.
If you define FUD as "fear, uncertainty, doubt" then I agree. But to me this is legitimate FUD because paper wallets really should be feared and doubted.
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:28:04
You should write down the wallet software used to recovery the wallet corresponding to the seed phrase. The [wiki page recommends that](
The Electrum software is open source so you're not trusting them in any meaningful way. (Except if you don't know how to code, but that your problem, you can always pay someone who knows). Not to mention that the same recovery issue is there with raw private keys.


If a wallet software does this then you should seriously avoid it, as it is a sign that the software is very out of date.
@_date: 2016-07-14 00:46:36
BTW you can enable pruning if you can't spare the disk space. Pruning takes disk usage down to about 2gb.

Thankfully there are more nodes than 5,000
I'd add to your OP, **run a node and use it as your wallet**. It's not enough to just spin up a node on a VPS and leave it. You have to have all your economic transactions be backed by your node, preferably running on your own hardware.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:47:10
The reason everyone is telling you to buy a wallet is because they're probably shills who work for hardware wallet manufacturers (or possibly satisfied customers). It's very possible and practical to securely store coins without buying anything.
One way to do this is cold storage: where you have an offline computer that holds your private keys. You have a watch-only online wallet that monitors your incoming transactions and constructs outgoing transactions. From there you transfer them to the offline wallet to sign.
Another way is multisignature wallets: where multiple private keys are required to spend money, and those keys are kept on various different machines. The reasoning being that malware or hackers are unlikely to infect your desktop computer, laptop and smartphone all at the same time.
As you say you only have a small amount, maybe a multisig wallet spread over your desktop and smartphone is the best way. Make sure you use a wallet that supports [seed phrases]( because they're the best backup method.
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:04:24

A seed phrase is written by hand, so avoids the problems with printers. It generates a HD wallet so avoids the problems of address reuse. Seed phrase HD wallets are also much better suited to using with your own full node, HD wallets make it easy to deal with change addresses as its all handled by the wallet software itself. And finally seed phrases use natural language words which have very good error correction built in unlike paper wallets.

Using positional number instead of written word removes the error correction that you get by using words.

3) You can get the private key by right clicking on an address, but storing the seed is the most important thing. Everything can be recovered from that.
4) Yes, except your wallet is online so in theory malware or a hacker could get it
5) I don't think Electrum can run on an iPhone.
So probably your workflow would be to follow this guide

Cold storage wallets avoid the problems of address reuse, the risks of handling raw privkeys, the fact that the cryptography is coded in javascript, the risks of printers, etc etc
In the bitcoin community the phrase "paper wallet" seems to mean only those single-address website-generated things, not all wallets that are stored on paper.

I wrote this long article about the general principles of storing coins:  There's also this 
Any good wallet will create seed phrases. That includes all hardware wallets, Electrum, Armory, Greenbit, BRD, etc
I do admit that paper wallets generally look much prettier and cooler than seed phrases written on paper. [Maybe they could be replaced by those metal storage seed phrase things.]( But as so many people end up losing money with paper wallets I really felt I have to let the community know, even if the solution doesn't look as cool.
There's also a debate to be had about the value of giving away coins to people who don't want it. Why should they value something that you just give away? I think far more people have became interested in bitcoin because they needed the properties like censorship-resistance and controlled inflation, or because investors HODL'd so much bitcoins that the price bubbled and they wanted in on it.

@_date: 2017-06-15 22:18:58
Not really, many of those protocols are actually very shitty. They are still around because everyone uses them.
Not to mention that any altcoin which became as popular as bitcoin would run into exactly the same scalability issues. They all use blockchains and so they all have to make a tradeoff between scale and decentralization. Ethereum, for example, has completely given up on decentralization which is why it's developers were able to force the TheDAO bailout hard fork onto the community.
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:34:38
I take it you were not around during the 2015-2017 scalability debate if you don't know why full nodes are important. Sorry but you're clearly a newb by not understanding something as fundamental as why full nodes are important. I mean this will full respect that you should read more and post less.
Here's some links to get you started:
1. Encoding a HD wallet into a QR code is silly, as it adds the requirement for a printer and requires that it be stored on paper rather than metal or something else. Seed phrase words are much better in this respect.
1. Ok fair.

BIP148 is a boycott. It is a portion of the economic majority saying that miners should do their freaking jobs or else they won't get paid.
Miners can do whatever NYA/segwit2x deal they like, but BIP148 is out there so they'll have to take notice. Last I've seen the segwit part of NYA is fully compatible with BIP148.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:35:08
Great news!
Would you consider coding BIP148 enforcement into bitsquare/BitcoinJ? It only requires the block version to be checked so even SPV wallets can enforce it.
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:48:49
It's easy to be optimistic now however at the time I remember it being pretty tough.
Bitcoin didn't stop working just because it's price had gone down. The fundamentals were always the same (mostly) but the price had deviated both upwards and downwards because of emotions.

There is no such thing as a good safe paper wallet. The only way to be safe with a paper wallet is to not use one. It's not only me saying this, it's every notable bitcoin developer including several who commented in this thread.

Bitcoin is designed with privacy in mind, so finding useful metrics will be hard. That's a feature not a bug.

This is data from before the FIBRE network was widely adopted:  someone's notes:  reddit discussion 
"Maintaining the status quo" means sticking with a flawed system. Just because an attack hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it wont.
The point of bitcoin is to be decentralized. If you want money that can be shut down at the stroke of a bureaucrat's pen then why don't you just use paypal. Everything you love about bitcoin comes from its decentralization.
I actually don't think we'll ever get a block interval increase in ordinary conditions like today. The way we'll get it is if government attempt to censor bitcoin and attack points of centralization. Miners who want to stay free will move their operations to be secret and the rest of the economy will do a UASF to help support the miners-in-hiding.
@_date: 2016-07-13 18:13:25
Did he? We do know that he added a line in the code to stop miners generating &gt;1mb blocks, and then a few weeks later added another line to stop full nodes accepting them. He only came out with *"Oh we'll easily remove it later"* story when someone challenged him.
It could be plausibly argued that he knew exactly what he was doing when building [Satoshi's Castle](
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:36:13
I get that. Bitcoin and gold indeed have different tradeoffs.
On the other hand, any amount of bitcoin can be stored for free very securely in a paper wallet or even a memorized mnemonic seed held in your brain, while for any serious amount gold needs vaults and armed guards. Plus gold's unlimited transactions only work face-to-face, bitcoin can be sent over the internet to anywhere in the world. To send gold any distance you need third parties.
Fact is, for bitcoin to work it needs a limit to the number of blockchain transactions (but not economic transactions, see Lighting Network). In the same way that for gold to work, you don't own it unless you hold it yourself.

Yes that bitcoin wiki page needs rewriting, it's on my todo list.
By cold storage I mean when the private keys and wallet software are on an offline computer. There is also a watch-only version of the wallet software on an online computer. When the user wants to spend money they construct an unsigned transaction on the online computer and then transfer it to the offline computer, which signs the transaction. The signed transaction is transferred back to the online computer which broadcasts it.
Electrum has a tutorial for doing this with their software 
@_date: 2019-05-22 19:08:17

@_date: 2018-12-20 23:31:30
Apparently in many newb's minds, deleting a software wallet is a good idea. They don't want to have bitcoins on an online computer as the tutorials keep telling them. They think the rest of their coins are still on the paper wallet so deleting it is fine. We can discuss here that newbs are really stupid and whatnot, but fact is that this situation has happened dozens of times. Raw private keys are just unintuitive.
I disagree that the problems of HD wallets with seed phrases are comparible. The gap limit issue can be easily solved by increasing the gap limit, many wallets don't even allow the user to create more addresses than gap_limit. All wallet software tell the user to keep the seed words safe, many wallets even require the user to type in the words again.
Where you see simplicity I see danger. Safety comes from dangerous parts being abstracted away. Simplicity is not a virtue if it leads to newbs losing their money.
Using a blockchain explorer is a bad idea. They are centralized websites that can spy on the user and lie to them. We regularly tell people here to use full node wallets for privacy and security, yet single-address paper wallets are designed in such a way that it's very hard to use a full node with them. One benefit of deterministic wallets is they fit well with blockchain rescanning procedures. I think this is another example where you see simplicity but I see danger. The simplicity you found comes at the cost of centralization.
From my point of view we who are knowledgable about bitcoin have a duty to stop bad information spreading. Newbs are ignorant but ignorance is not a crime. Also, it will increase the value of our held bitcoins if it doesn't get a reputation as a risky asset to hold. Finally, if newbs are told to rely on centralized validation like blockchain explorers then one day we may find consensus rules like the 21 million limit are broken because not enough of the economy uses full nodes.

People are worried about UASF being used for bad things. UASFs only work if the economic majority supports them. By definition the economic majority won't do things that harm it's coin.
