As I understand it, the general consensus in Greece as recent as last week was that they were going to reach a deal. It seemed as though the rest of the world was not so hopeful.
In my opinion, they were either close to a deal that fell through or the media had everyone convinced.

Make sure you keep your recovery seed in fireproof bags within the safe or in another secure location. Even if the Trezor is destroyed in a fire, you'll still have the recovery keys.

4 just seems the most logical. Spam is not an issue because of transaction fees so scaling based on the past 144 blocks just makes sense.

Lightning Network / similar solutions could theoretically allow scalability from its current level to billions of tps when it's implemented.

This is a classic example of one form of the 1% fallacy — if Bitcoin is good enough to store 1% of the world's wealth, it's likely good enough to store much, much more than that.

Yes, I believe you're correct on all counts from a high level standpoint. Keep in mind that if you set a password (in addition to a PIN) on setup that you won't be able to recover your wallet unless you have your recovery seed (word combination) **AND** your password. Otherwise, all you need is the recovery seed so if someone steals that then they can effectively steal your coins.
Also, I recommend ordering a fireproof bag to store the recovery seed. (This is the one I use:  Remember to diversify where you hold your coins as well. As your wallet grows, diversify into other Trezors, other hardware wallets, etc.
EDIT: clarifying
@_date: 2016-01-27 02:32:15

You really can't expect someone to hire you as a developer if you're not skilled as a developer. Take courses online (youtube, udemy, teamtreehouse, etc.) if you'd like to learn and then you can find a job in the space.
Not trying to be a downer but I find it highly improbable anyone would invest tens of thousands of dollars into teaching you something when they could hire someone else who already knows that 'something' instead.

I believe the **2.3** is referring to 2.3 TPS per MB, so 165MB blocks would mean 380 TPS.

IIRC, the 8mb is a "compromise" from the larger, original 20mb proposal. I believe Chinese miners pushed for the 8mb but did not give much justification as to why.

So much irony in this post. This is nothing short of censorship. If your stance on Bitcoin / BIP 101 is the 'right way' to go in your opinion, then prove it in an unbiased, uncensored setting. Let a real debate happen.

I'll take a gradual, predictable rise (BIP 101) over a wonky rollercoaster block size any day.
EDIT: Also important to keep in mind that the graph ends in 2019, so this is the "max block size growth" up until 2019. I believe it ends at 2019 to make it seem as though BIP 101 will result in the smallest possible blocks, whereas in reality they will go as high as 8GB blocks (which is good, imo.)

Apple Pay does not pay with any credits or currency made by Apple. It just links to your existing credit / debit card and makes the purchase using a secure one time token instead of your credit card's token.

I went halfsies on a miner with someone when the network difficulty was still at a reasonable level. I'm not sure what the other person did with their coins, but we technically broke even based on the exchange rate at that time.
I never sold any of my coins and viewed it as an interesting experiment to learn more about the technology. Most people who "lost money" are just too short-term focused. I think a substantial amount of people viewed mining as a magical cash grab that would somehow alleviate their debt, when in reality they were making an uneducated decision that just exacerbated their poor financial management.

It depends on how you think about it. If you think about the value of the BTC in terms of fiat currency then sure, you've lost that perceived value.
But if you think of it as a long term investment in what *could* be the basis of a new, global financial system then their initial investment of 1.4 BTC is still worth exactly 1.4 BTC. What you peg that value against is up to you.

I think we need to be careful when saying things like "**will** be stagnated" because that gives off the assumption that something has already been done to accomplish that.

This already exists in many major cities in the US and requires use of the govt app.

You don't need the PIN if you have the recovery seed. He's talking about an additional (optional) layer where you can add a password that prevents you from using the recovery seed unless you enter the password first.

I didn't think it existed either, but the Trezor is pretty easy to use. Just put your recovery key in a fire proof safe deposit box at a bank and you're good to go. Even if the Trezor is destroyed, you can still recover your Bitcoins. You own the private keys, etc.
