The market is not irrational. I represents the rational outcome of greed.

HODL until it's not even worth the effort of selling. Then you can have it forever and wait for the spring.

That's grossly assuming the conclusion of the technology being successful. Yes, they laughed and laughed at the visionaries. They also laughed and laughed at the cuckoos too, and there were many more cuckoos than visionaries. Only time will tell if it was one or the other, oh wait, it's already telling.

you're **DAMN** right they don't. If they did they wouldn't buy clunky digital Monopoly money.

That is a sensible request but unfortunately it does not jive with market speculators and manipulators running the show and nor does it with the crypto-enthusiasts' denial-fuelled optimism. This sub's logo, the one with the redditor lovingly embracing the Bitcoin, will be the subject of memes regarding greedy people who got suckered "some years ago" and when we'll be talking crypto former enthusiasts will be embarrassed. This process will take some time as crypto-as-a-scam has to be burned into the collective consciousness. In the meantime, I fully expect the levels of denial to reach ludicrous levels, then we'll see some spectacular suicide stories on TV.
I'm not a monster, I don't *wish* for these things, I never *wished* for people to go broke, lose their money, become desperate. However, it's a world of difference between how I wish things happened and how they do. The lack of practical use for the volatile and clunky-to-pay-with currency means that it will always be at the mercy of market sharks, and coiners along with it. This is the message that's actively being snubbed in subs like this, it's a message of lucidity and temperance that would be approved by Warren Buffet in a heartbeat, because this isn't a wise investment scheme, it's a maelstrom in which the naive, gullible and easy to bamboozle with technobabble lose their galleons, advertised as calm seas that lead to a promised El Dorado by the sharks that lie underneath.
