Mom was an emt... A field medic. She could write scripts whenever she wanted. I very CLEARLY remember massive white pharmacy bottles FULL of mdma. The military already knows that mdma is good for ptsd. And so do i.

Where did the bank get the capital?
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:18:34
The federal reserve creates money. The banks just ask fpr it on loan and we the people have to pay that debt. 9 dollars are owed by we the people for every one dollar the fed prints.

Oh really. Thats fucking odd. I might be wrong but ico stands for initial coin offering correct? Was there not an initial offering of coin? I might have missed the initial mining stage and am using incorrect terminology here but my point here is that when coin was stupid ass cheap i bought a shit ton for the sake of just saying i had a bunch of it. I quit paying attention to the climbing value and tossed out that old vista box. Hdd and all. I dont keep sensitive data and i have nothing to hide. So tossing out an old machine means nothing to me. Well it does now lol.

No i don't think its a good idea. I clicked one captcha and got 3 satoshi and immediately came to the conclusion that that was a retarded ass waste of time. I know full well that without the requisite gear that mining is just as retarded if not more as that actually COSTS money. The only truly viable option is to go to a high yield gambling site that has dice and play a few random number tricks that minimally adjust your outcomes by .0000001% at best. What I'm getting at here is short of doing business in bitcoin or flat out buying it, is there any other viable method? 
Ps: don't be a condescending ass.

I'm kind of weary of dumping cash that i transmuted from blood and sweat into an aethereal currency. Though i find that concept laughable knowing my blood and sweat was transmuted into debt notes and not gold.

You know what... I respect you and your answer. All these other asshats are just fucking rude and have zero answers. I can completely see your point. It was short. Sweet. And direct. Thank you. Moving on now.

No not free. Just looking for ways to aquire it besides spending fiat currency on it.
