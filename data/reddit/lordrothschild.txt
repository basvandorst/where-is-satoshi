So, how did "hackers" steal millions of dollars worth of fiat from Mt.Gox bank accounts? 
@_date: 2014-08-15 09:58:16
Did the US government take the fiat as well? 
@_date: 2014-09-11 12:09:16
It's easy to say that now. But if BTC really falls hard, it might feel a lot worse than you can currently imagine.

Where did the millions of dollars worth of fiat go?

Why am I not receiving the email needed to confirm my BTC withdrawal? Is this a known issue? 
@_date: 2014-08-24 14:53:20
And if it does happen, it's already priced in, so price won't go up either way.

How many years do you reckon Bitcoin will stay in beta?

"The 2025 Bitcoin Riots" is a bad phrase when used in an article talking about contemporary events, even when the article is fiction set in the future. It makes the headline look rather amateurish. "Bitcoin Riots Escalate" would be a more suitable headline. Only in retrospect would it be needed to refer to the year the riots took place.

Interesting. I suspect that's the general trend.
@_date: 2014-09-28 20:15:04
Bitcoin is almost 6 years old, actually. Not really a new technology.

What's your theory?

Have you heard about Google?

Never mind. I found the answer. It was actually my fault all along. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:45:44
Yeah, this is huge, and the price clearly reflects that. BTC price is shooting through the roof today. We're obviously headed for the Moon or Mars. The demand is just incredible.

The guy also stole millions of dollars worth of fiat from Mt.Gox bank accounts, a fact that is easily forgotten, for some reason. 
Or perhaps "hackers" hacked into the bank accounts and stole millions of dollars due to a "transaction malleability bug" in the legacy banking system?

I know from personal experience that fiat disappeared from their bank accounts. It was also reported in the media. This is purely anecdotal and doesn't count as evidence, but I and countless others know firsthand that our money is gone. Gone in the sense that it doesn't even show up in our balance on Gox when we log in these days. (This is EUR wired via SEPA to Gox' Polish bank account.)
One might ask oneself how likely it is that hackers managed to steal fiat from bank accounts. 
And we know for a fact that Mark Karpeles actively withheld information and lied about the financial and technical state of Gox right up until the very end. And right up until today, actually. He chose to continue accepting BTC- and fiat deposits up until the moment the site went down for good. He said nothing about the true state of the site. Instead, he actively lied. 
Mark Karpeles is a crook, a thief, a scammer and a liar. 
And he'll never face a prison sentence.

For some reason, people ignore the fact that Tux didn't just steal a whole lot of BTC. He also stole millions of dollars worth of fiat. 
Yes, "hackers" actually "hacked" Mt.Gox bank accounts, and ran away with millions of USD, EUR, etc. 
Why is this fact always ignored?

Those three quarters of a penny will soon be worth a thousand dollars. Any day now ...

0.25 % of their sales are in Bitcoin! Damn, that's a really huge number! Impressive!
