It's better to make new cool staff than trying to reanimate old one.

That's a very good idea! But are a lot of people interested in tips to sites?

I'm not sure there will be no problems with Bitcoin Exchange bankruptcy
@_date: 2014-07-02 07:14:36

Haha, he is a funny guy, but he really succeed to tell about btc in a few words and with all necessary details
@_date: 2014-02-13 14:25:20
That's not a new concept. The reason why it doesn't work that's there will always be a risk with all transactions. This concept is just an instrument to get money from transactions cause it has fee.

Great Job! A concept for a P2P Fiat-Bitcoin Exchange looks elaborate. Need more time to get in every detail though from first sight it is really great system. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:29:21
Is that good for bitcoin or not?
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:26:26
what is the difference? I'm not sure, but the point is that people who had their coins won't be able to get them back?
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:29:04
There is an advice: never give the wallet to your dad :)
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:15:24
With BTC there is no difference in your ability to use your money if you hold it yourself!
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:09:16
oh you will not make me read that whole thread!
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:17:12
In a lot of cases BTC really equals drugs
