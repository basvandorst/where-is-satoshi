It's in my Roth, so even though I only had the ETF for about 2 months, I bought at ~$600 and sold at $1495, and I won't owe any taxes on it. This is in my personal rollover Roth with Vangaurd, which doesn't have a ton of money in it (my current one though work is my legit retirement account and I'm much more conservative with it). It's basically my play money for stocks and funds.

Well in that case...

Just look at it like you're only paying 10-20% of your actual rent.

This is basically what I tell everyone who jokes to me about owning Bitcoin. It doesn't matter that it's down 80% from the ATH if you're still up 1000% from when you bought.
For that matter, it doesn't matter if you bought at a previous ATH if the next ATH is 500%+ higher (not that this is a good strategy, it's just to put things in perspective).

Yeah, but I have money in my Roth to invest already. I don't have as much cash on hand.

In other news, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) is up over 14% today.

I'm planning on getting out soon. This was a risky play from the start and I agree with the idea that once more legitimate ETFs come out that this one is going to drop. I've already gotten 200% from when I originally bought a few months ago, so I'm happy.

Basically with other mutual funds you have the entire financial industry behind it and all the "guarantees" and legal protections they come with. The Bitcoin fund works the same way on the surface, you buy shares of something else that the manager actually owns, but with Bitcoin there's no safety net.

I'm not even a vet. I bought in less than a year ago and I'm still up around 300%.

I'm on vacation right now, and in my Google Now feed it shows me the price of Bitcoin in Dominican pesos without me having to ask.
