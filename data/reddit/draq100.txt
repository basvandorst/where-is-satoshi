If  attackers have enough power (in this case Bitcoins) they can cause panic by selling their goods at low price. Crowd can follow that trend by lowering their price quickly, thinking that there's a crash, that somebody knows something they doesn't. Bitcoin is very volatile and can be swinged rather easily.

This is imo good source for finding short explanation:
or just take some text/pictures from this video or install small screen playing this:

Here's something you want about Mt Gox limits: 
Most deposit methods don't have limits. Interational wire has 50 000 USD limit
Withdrawal limits - generally "1000 USD per 24hr period and 10000 USD per 30 Day period"

I agree that the video doesn't explain in-depth what the mining is, but in my opinion it's made 'for masses'. Short, smooth video (similar to a video from weusecoins.com) describing mining in general, being good start and containing basic things users need to know. 
I forgot to mention in post's title that the video contains only basics, my bad. However, most people don't need to know that at this point miners are spending $500k in power consumption daily. 
Anyway, I think that there should be more about system protection, that it prevents creating fake coins, double spending, etc., instead of that miners are 'approving transactions'

The problem is not volume of trade (current 0.01 is fine for me), but amount of that trades.
I think it'd be better if user could place only 3 orders per minute or so.

They'd have to create many new accounts on Mt Gox and in my opinion switching between them wouldn't be easy enough
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:16:03
Unfortunately, it works too often.

Massive sell-out started this. People selling at $180-182 when it was at $190

Mt Gox calculator's lag won't allow anyone to sell low
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:37:27
Andddddddddd 1 minute lag!

Love that part about mithril :D

Believers are still here, just 'hypers' are often the ones who shout loudest to hype something even more.

Better make melissa tea or something to drink after you wake up.

Knowing crowd, it's most likely it'll happen after maintenance
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:58:58
Probably by using their program with Mt Gox API

They don't make much on 0.01 trades and regular users don't have to put many offers. That limit could be i.e. put on selling only or when selling less than 1 BTC. 
More people would trade on their site, cause there should be less lags. More people (traders too) would be willing to use Bitcoins, cause there'd be lesser volatility on the market after eliminating 0.01 bots.
On first sight Mt. Gox would have lesser earnings on this limit but after taking full effects of this action they'd have more profit. Bitcoins would become more trading friendly than speculators friendly.

If you have wallet files somewhere it's still valid, it has no expiration date. Only wallet file itself is needed. As you said you have hard drive somewhere, so that shouldn't be a problem
 question
It increases potential value of Bitcoins, as some of those 21 mln are lost and non recoverable. However, it shouldn't affect trading as Bitcoins are highly divisible.

Imo this is most likely option, maybe not 1 bln but anyway too much crowd for those website ;)

Hey, 
I have couple questions:
1. What language did you use for trade engine ?
2. Are you planning LTC support?
3. Are you planning to upgrade your trading engine to be more scalable?
Also, please inform people what's going on. With this no info policy you made bigger and bigger panic on the market.
One more thing: could you set orders limit (ex 5 orders/ minute) to prevent automated 0.01 trades?

I didn't open the site earlier, thanks for the info.
It's clear that BFL made/sponsored this website. Even there're Avalon's ASICs mentioned on hardware page it's said that those consume more power. So, they made nice ad.

Your addresses are under "Receive coins" tab.
At first you have 1 address, you can generate more after clicking 'New address' button.
I recommend you securing your wallet, for example by using TrueCrypt. You can read more about securing here:

That should show hours instead of days, even then 3 digits is too much
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:15:10
It's said 'new hardware'.
Maybe they bought 2 Raspberry PI's to be able to watch streams on YouTube while main server is lagging
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:32:25
I would be good to set 'usage hours' on whole Bitcoin system. Miners could rest for a while.

Sadly, this comment is so true here in Poland.

If Bitcoin is found to help fund a murder with knife...

Starting market panic :D
Crowd followed this attack and for a while it was $172
