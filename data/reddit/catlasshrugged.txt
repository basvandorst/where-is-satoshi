Hey Onename,
First, thanks for your work on decentralized identity. It's an important space, and I appreciate that effort.
However, right now your API only seems to allow users to store a single Bitcoin address, encouraging address reuse. This is a tremendous privacy weakness in the OneName system. One of the reasons why people are not pursuing identity &lt;-&gt; bitcoin address systems more is because of this engineering challenge.
Luckily, it was recently solved by BIP47 reusable payment codes. As soon as possible, I recommend that you work toward allowing users to link RPCs to their onename identities. I would caution anyone against using this lookup service for Bitcoin payments until this change is deployed.
There's some work to be done in terms of spreading BIP47 implementation, but there's no one who would be more benefited by this work than a Bitcoin address lookup register like yourselves.

I think this is a very interesting starting place, but your observations about the banking consortium are a poignant indicator of how flawed the metric is in its current state.
If the conclusion is that a group of mega-corporations that are joined at the hip of the government have greater censorship resistance than Bitcoin miners, then you've exercised faulty logic.
I think what is primarily missing from this metric is the incentive for individual miners in a pool to preserve the Bitcoin price, and their ability to move between pools accordingly.

Maybe. Some code bases are very difficult to audit. Consider, for example, the code produced by this underhanded C contest: 


Open source is the norm these days. Aside from the challenge of auditing code, the BIP helps standardize wallets so that they are leaking less information about what client is in use for a transaction.
@_date: 2015-06-25 16:16:04
That's great!
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:44:27
There's lots of ways to modify a transaction so that it still gets treated essentially the same by the bitcoin network. Thus several transactions can have different data but be functionally equivalent. This quality of transactions is often referred to as "transaction malleability."
If you have maliciously modified someone's wallet code, you can use this fact to inject some data -- like their private key! -- into the transaction without tipping anyone else off. Later on, you can scan the blockchain for these sneakily-formed transactions and extract the private key to steal the bitcoins.

This is really exciting. I'm looking forward to testing the alpha when it's available. Most of all, I'm excited about a thoughtful implementation of CoinJoin and Stealth Addresses.
I'm also concerned about side channel attacks when it comes to Bitcoin anonymity. What would it take to use the Chrome or Firefox plug-ins through a privacy network such as Tor or I2P? Ideally, I would like to use Dark Wallet in a hardened operating system such as Tails, and I've been disappointed over and over again by Bitcoin client developers who do not ensure compatability with these privacy-focused Linux distrobutions.

Since there are no fees, how will this project be funded in the future? Bitcoin struggles with this, in that their developers are not highly paid for their work, but if they can sit on the bitcoins long enough they appreciate greatly in value. In other open source projects like Linux, there is a model of companies forming around the free project and an expectation that those companies will contribute code back to the project. How do you envision OB development and design being funded in the future?

As one of the authors of this report, I'd like to chime in on the fairness of this statement. Mycelium, like every other Bitcoin wallet currently existence, rated exceptionally poorly, offering only about 50% of the protection that they could to users' privacy. We still have a long way to go before any wallet reaches a basic level of maturity in this area. I hope that doesn't sound too mean-spirited, but I don't want users to grow complacent about how much privacy they are missing out on.
@_date: 2015-05-28 23:56:15
I don't understand your call for regulation. You pointed out that funds are at risk, and pointed out a market solution called "insurance." If users want their funds insured, they'll use services that include that, and won't use services that don't include that. Of what relevance is state regulation?
Edit: Also, if you mess up with key generation, multisig is generally irrelevant since the multiple keys required for spending will usually generated by the same software.

This is accurate, though this is derived from the threat model we created prior to examining the wallets. As others have pointed out, people can easily proposed changes, fork, or submit PRs to this model. So far I haven't gotten anything useful out of people's whining in lieu of specific feedback.

This is a really cool idea! Creating market incentives for CoinJoin is an excellent development. I would be curious to see some analysis on the effect on Sybil attacks. It does offset some of the costs of a Sybil attack, but increases incentive for the honest crowd to outnumber the attacker, as well. I'm curious how it shakes out overall.
@_date: 2015-10-23 22:52:18
That's an interesting idea. If I were a miner, I would seriously consider doing this, since poor privacy affects the whole ecosystem and thus the value of the mined coins.
@_date: 2015-10-22 02:50:21
Good question! There are several things that can be done.
Ultimately, users probably should not be handling Bitcoin addresses. The protocol probably should have prevented address reuse, but we're stuck with a protocol that allows it, a user base that has no clue how properly manage cryptographic keys (addresses are public keys, more or less), and a software ecosystem that is **slowly** moving away from intentional address reuse in many areas.
When users need to handle any kind of address, I would prefer them to handle something like a BIP47 RPC. These are user-friendly addresses.
In the meantime, the way that addresses are presented to users by software clients is very important. For example, when a wallet client registers a payment, it ought to disappear any QR code from the screen so that the user doesn't accidentally reuse it. This a criterion for OBPP's wallet ratings. Other criteria that we use concerning feedback to users includes:
* Warn users and ask them to confirm before sending to any address with a transaction history
* Warn users and ask them to confirm before sending to an address that they have sent funds to themselves
Aside from negligent programming that reuses addresses by default, the UX of wallet clients has a huge impact on how informed users are and whether they are steered toward or away from address reuse.
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:03:53
I haven't seen any updated research, and unfortunately haven't had the time to run my tool against it again. Also, I did not contribute to the update; SharedCoin is such a relatively small part of the website that it's difficult to find time to focus on it. A little while ago someone posted that he had created a much speedier version of my tool that could probably quickly confirm how effective the patch was, but I've been having trouble finding that reddit post again. :(
Edit: FWIW, I think SharedCoin is still a useful and cheap tool when used in a chain of mixing services. I'm hoping that something like Dark Wallet (or JoinMarket?) will be suitable for replacing it when it goes from alpha to beta. Still, for the indefinite future I recommend using a mixing chain to provide privacy-in-depth.
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:57:52

My preferred solution: Send to a BIP47 RPC. The only thing worse than giving an exchange your withdrawal addresses is giving them a virtually infinite list of addresses and potentially forgetting that they will be able to track all of them in perpetuity.
@_date: 2015-03-17 15:06:18
I am the guy who wrote the report. SharedCoin has, indeed, been updated to be more resistant to sudoku analysis. It's still far from a perfect CoinJoin implementation, though. The more similar that inputs and oupts can be the more privacy is afforded, but that makes it more difficult to find the volume. Creating a fee-based market for providing volume is a great idea.
@_date: 2015-02-03 03:55:16
Also, more were invited who cound't make it, not all of whom I would characterize as "elite."
@_date: 2016-07-29 17:47:16
One way to add ambiguity into your transaction graph is to perform extra transactions among addresses under your own control. 
This is quite helpful, for example, if you move funds into or out of Coinbase, since their blockchain analytics has the highest confidence about the nature of the transaction immediately preceding or proceeding.
Likewise, the more rounds of CoinJoin transactions you perform, the more private your funds will be. But each round requires you to pay your share of the mining fee.
Fees are still very low by first-world standards, but as on-chain fees continue to rise, I'm concerned that people may be priced out of performing such intermediate transactions as basic privacy hygiene.
@_date: 2016-07-07 21:31:48
I'd have to see how it's used a wallet. It would likely help avoid address reuse, but collecting PII in the wallet will likely be heavily punished in our ratings.
@_date: 2015-02-03 05:56:50


@_date: 2016-07-11 17:16:16
The relevant criterion is not yet finalized for the next report, but currently reads:


So requiring PII would be punished, but collecting it optionally and sharing it at the discretion of the user would not necessarily be.
I suspect that we'll need to add more nuance to this in the future as more wallets integrate fiat exchange functionality.

Great questions!
gmaxwell's proposal involves joining inputs that are equivalent in value, which helps to hide the inputs amongst one another. SharedCoin doesn't do this, and thus leaks a lot of information. There are some other ways of implementing CoinJoin without equivalent inputs (such as using powers of two), but SharedCoin doesn't do that, either.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:12:38
SharedCoin is loosely based on CoinJoin, but it's not an implementation of CoinJoin.

Based on this evidence and the OP I think it's safe to say that the 32-bit version is extremely suspect and probably all of the versions of the Yacoin client by virtue of association.
