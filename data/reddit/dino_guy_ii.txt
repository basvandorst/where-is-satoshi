Bad analogy.
"Basic economics" can't be applied to a hypothetical communist society because these "basic economics" are taught and based on a capitalist mode of production.
It's like refusing to believe that dandelions use wind dispersal to pollinate because 'basic botany' states that tomato plants spread their seeds by feeding them to animals in fruit.

Sounds good to me

This point is really confusing me. What do you mean by "infinite period of time"? Literally from now until the heat death of the universe? If so, that's the most retarded thing I've heard all day. Can you please clarify?
Now, why exactly would there be scarcity? Do you have a link to any articles or studies on why scarcity must always be present? It sounds interesting.


How is this any more efficient than communally collecting resources and letting people take what they need? Wouldn't this be less efficient, as producers would, for example, create useless but flashy products to sell to consumers as it could make them the most money?


Resources are scarce because of the capitalist system. Ever heard of [Artificial Scarcity]( [We produce enough food to feed 10 billion]( and there's [6 vacant homes for every homeless person in the US]( just to name a couple of examples.

A communist society shouldn't have a system of currency at all
