And yet Filipinos say 'Aluminium'. Somehow we screwed up the imperialism thing.

that feeling when you're an American and realize your knowledge of other countries is quite limited

XD Australia seems like the earth's armpit. ... and then New Zealand, close by, is somehow that small part of the upper back that when people discover, they're like "oh wow this is amazing".

Is this not supporting evidence for evolutionary psychology? i.e., mankind today is not entirely rational and somewhat prone to excessive boldness because sometimes doing so has great reward?

Posting this seems like working for a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I'm at a Japanese university and this is happening to me now. Do you suppose it's for all of Japan? Or someone else at this university so it's the entire university? Any suggestions?

I understand the argument about conversion to fiat; I don't know what your last sentence means (what 'deflationary' means); I do not see the application of your cookies: Again, dividing a physical thing necessarily has diminishing returns. Bitcoins are not physical. They can be divided indefinitely (unless there is a technological limitation), and human psychology does not know how to regard the fraction because it is intangible -- hence now one bitcoin is worth thousands of dollars so that it appears 1/1000 Bitcoin is the de facto standard unit. It seems plausible it will continue this way until 1/1,000,000 is the new standard unit. Hence it appears the cap is effectively infinite.

Serious question here (please answer): How is the price of Bitcoin fixed -- I mean, how are the number of coins truly capped -- if it can be divided into smaller portions to a great extent? It appears to me instead of needing 500 US cents to buy a loaf of bread when it used to cost 5, Bitcoin is simply "inflating" in the opposite direction of the decimal -- 0.05 Bitcoin for what used to cost 5.
With this perspective, "only a finite number of Bitcoins will exist" appears to be a meaningless or irrelevant statement. In other words, finiteness in this sense would only be true if Bitcoin were not divisible.

I'm inclined to think the opposite: Have you seen the outcome of recent elections? Most people are sheep who want others to govern them. Most people don't see the problem -- and when they feel its effects, they believe what they're told.

It's been flat since around June 8th on GDAX.
