Nah, it’s just the new Winnebago to avoid the 5 dollar wrench attack.

I love everything about this. Thank you

I wasn’t trying to spread FUD about anything.  Just an observation.  Maybe tin foil hat but maybe someone is trying to fuck with us with knowledge of the patent. To what end I don’t know as this isn’t that earth shattering news imo. 
Again, just my impressions when I look st the pic.

Oh snap. You have a great point there.

I like this. Anything to drive home the limitations of our meat brains to grasp these very low probability events is always welcomed.

Good point. I didn’t  think about how it could be displaying something as simple as a screenshot.

Thanks. I’ll look into the old leak (or wait to hear an actual release). 
For the technical folks interesting to hear thoughts on the underlying hardware/software security and threats for this vs hardware wallets vs those “blockchain phones”

Perhaps the patient is Satoshi

Thank you that’s very helpful.  I had no idea that phone software wallets actually use the secure hardware element.

The piece of paper covering the Nokia is more convincing than the Samsung

I don’t know why but each time I look at that pic I see a piece of paper taped over a phone. 
It just looks kinda strange imo
@_date: 2019-01-24 13:41:35
That’s fair. I haven’t had a Samsung in a while. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 13:43:13
Forgive a stupid question - but how much secure is this as opposed to a typical software phone wallet?  Does it have a sort of secure element chip similar to hardware wallets?

That’s a scary power to have over someone. I hereby release you from my influence kind sir ����
