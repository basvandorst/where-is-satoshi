the number of these kind of attacks will only grow larger from year to year...

This is definitely not a cold wallet and not even a hardware wallet. This is a simple software wallet, similar to a an offline PC with Electrum. I wouldn't store more than 100$ on it.

Of course it's "fun and easy to use", it has zero compromises for security. It has a camera, internet connection, a cool operating system. Hell, you can even send all your coins to a different address without needing to "annoyingly verify the address" like with Ledger/Trezor. It's easy to use as it's easy to steal.

How is the gift card provider protected? What happens if the buyers never confirms receiving the package?

Doesn't matter how you store your coins (hardware wallet, paper wallet, etc) you will always end up with a "secret" that needs to be stored on paper.
The secret can be a seed or private key, they are equal in their properties.
I don't see a difference between using a paper wallet vs a hardware wallet + seed.

What's your country?

Yes, I agree. But imagine if all your users were used to approve the receive address every time it's displayed. Such users have a much higher chance to sense something is wrong if a malware completely removed the "force" feature.
IMHO, this is the best way to educate your users, by practice and not by updating your FAQ.
BTW, a bullet-proof solution would be to display the address only on the wallet's screen (completely remove it from the GUI). But I guess with the current screen size it may be impossible to display a QR code, and manually copying the address may be inconvenient/error-prone.

Exactly. The solution here is simple and straightforward. It's a shame the Ledger team decided to take the easy path and throw the responsibility over to the user. Well done Trezor team.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but all your examples refer to payments/transfer-of-goods. Which is exactly what cryptocurrencies do today (the biggest use case of blockchain).

Looks awesome! Nice job :)

Once an address had been validated, you can continue using it safely. The problem is how to validate the first address you received? If your machine would've been infected with a malware during your first deposit, you would have no way to validate the address and could potentially lose the entire deposit.

Nicolas, as long as the user can fail, he will fail. IMHO, hardware wallets must be idiot/dummy proof. Be honest with yourself, you know that the average Ledger user won't read your FAQ, won't use the monitor button and therefore will probably lose coins in case he is attacked. Personally I would force the user to confirm the address every time it's **displayed**, but also choosing Trezor's solution (confirming every time it's **created**) can help protect against this attack.

I'm not sure I understand .. Would you like to pay via USD and the merchant receives Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2015-10-13 00:37:44
Each vulnerability is a special snowflake and must be inspected manually. Some vulnerabilities can't lead to code execution and would only be able to crash the vulnerable software (in this case Bitcoin Core) but not run code. But a lot of them could be developed into a full blown exploit that would lead to remote code execution. I cant tell you if this vulnerability could be escalated, one might spend weeks trying to do so. But I can tell you that even with ASLR\DEP\Stack Protection a lot of exploit developers will find ways to triumph. To bypass ASLR one might search for a single module that has ASLR off, or use heap spray, or use a memory leak to find the address of an ASLR module. To bypass DEP one might use ROP (return oriented programming) ... you see where I'm going. Another important fact, not all OS'es support these features. Older versions of Windows (e.g. XP) might not support all these protection and would be **trivial** to exploit.

These kind of problems may seem obvious or too abstract but they are very good because they might identify the root problems in Bitcoin.
How they will be solved is our job, but we first must understand what bothers you the most.

Vulnerability Researcher and Exploit Developer here: Short story long, if you don't take measures to defend yourself (as explained by TheAwer) an attacker might be able to completely PWN your computer (e.g. Install malicious software and steal all your coins) **without any human interaction** (no need to download\install anything, just staying connected to the internet is enough).
This is super cool.
