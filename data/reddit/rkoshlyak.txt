I think the problem is that Bitcoin is not well known for now
@_date: 2016-11-11 02:05:19
We do believe that we will increase bit price with our project, so your benefit will be inside bits that you already have

would you classify yourself as speculator?

I totally agree with you, I am personally the author of Mars video.
And if I had to explain why that video is good one with one youtube video, I would use "madmen Lucky Strike Ad pitch"
Idea is that, other crypto currency used for illegal activities and Bitcoin is accepted on Mars.

You will be able to see it after end of voting period.

Thank you, we were considering doing it. We decided to go with 15 seconds video because they work better for a brand awareness campaigns.
Maybe in future, we will try to do it with pictures. One more reason why we decided to go with short video format is that we have a tool that would enable anyone from community create 15 second video in 15 minutes.
@_date: 2016-11-11 02:47:09
We are doing something similar
@_date: 2016-11-07 22:35:20
1) decentralization
2) predictive inflation
3) Anonymity
1) No way to recover stolen money
2) Speed of transaction
3) Wasted resources (electricity used to calculate hashes)
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:40:19
Yes, English is my second language.
Our target audience is everyone.
In the beginning, we will start with US country. Our goal is to do demand generation campaign. So we want to make more people that would like to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-08 01:38:04
There are a lot of different bitcoin startups, all of them offer different products. We are not doing education or promotion for some specific Bitcoin startup, we are doing a brand campaign for Bitcoin.
Once we will inspire people to learn more about Bitcoin, there are a lot of startups that would love to educate people how to use their product.
@_date: 2016-12-07 02:52:28
Thank you for you feedback.
Can you make your feedback more actionable.
Please give specific suggestions for every author under a video. You will see comment box after voting. We hide comments so you can vote and then read feedback from a community.
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:05:39


@_date: 2016-12-07 05:44:01
I think most effective brand ads campaign is based on emotions.
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:53:42
Good question, you will be able to see votes for each video at the end of a voting period. We don't show a number of votes now, so everyone would have a chance to make their own decision and did not go with a most popular option.
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:38:06
You are right, we are in demand generation business. Once person asking himself "How can I get started with Bitcoin" our job is done. I think there are a lot of startups that would love to fulfill such demand.

In the beginning, we have 3 creators that would be incorporating feedback from a community and creating content. In few weeks, we will open up a creative tool where anyone would be able to create 15 seconds video in 15 minutes. We a making sure that anyone will be able to present their vision to the community. There will be no compensation for the author (think about it as 15 minutes donation to a Bitcoin community). You will be able to see guidelines for ads in the tool.

So you don't think that Bitcoin can be accepted on Mars? Or that it is only currency?
30 minutes ago on meetup, I come to the random guy and ask him first association for Bitcoin and he told me that would be "illegal", would it be better if his association would be "accepted on Mars"?
But again, thank you, for your feedback, please leave feedback under the video on a page and next week authors will try to incorporate feedback in new videos.
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:03:50
Yes, I see them too
@_date: 2016-12-09 21:27:55
Yep, I see what i mean.
"Bitcon - Swiss Bank account in their pocket" - said Obama, not really correct in an ad.
Saying it without referencing to Obama and ad will be not so impressive.
I am currently working with overdraft fee idea
@_date: 2016-12-07 02:59:46
Thank you, please give your feedback for specific videos and bring your ideas, in this way next time videos will be better.
@_date: 2016-12-07 03:55:14
Your feedback is valid, that some people would think it.
We are planning to do a brand survey after ad campaign to see what exactly people think.
But you can do an experiment, you can show that Mars video to someone who knew nothing about programming or Bitcoin and then ask them what they think. And if you will share that experiment with us you will help us to improve.
@_date: 2016-12-07 02:22:55
I hope a response to a Coinosphere's comment clear up why we are choosing this format.
A format is following: 15 seconds, video, 2 lines with messages and closing screen with a brand.
We choose this format for simplicity and efficiency in branding campaigns.
@_date: 2016-12-07 06:06:13
Thank you, I think other people working on building scan bitcoin wallets;)

Thank you for you feedback.
It is good that you are PISSED about this 3 videos. It means that you are passion about it. You can give feedback to individual authors in a comment section on the site and all authors will try to incorporate your feedback on next week videos.
A format for the video is fixed and very limited, because we are planning to allow anyone create video, since we want this to be a community effort. For this reason, we are limiting format of the video in order to make it very simple, like anyone can do it in 15 minutes, to put their vision up for a community for consederation.
@_date: 2016-12-09 20:30:22
swiss bank in your pocket - was not about Bitcoin, it was about iPhone
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:34:55
Bitcoin is a decentralized technology and it a need a decentralized branding strategy. At Nike - there one person who made a decision that branding will be "just do it", in Coca-Cola - there one person who made a decision that branding will be "Always Coca-Cola". There is no such person for Bitcoin. For this reason, we want a community to create branding message in a collaborative way.
For this reason, we limit the format to be simple, so that anyone from a community was able to present his vision for a Bitcoin branding.
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:03:19
Hey, do an experiment, get QR code with a $10 and try to give it away to a random person on the street, you would be surprised with results

We will be running such voting every week. So there will be around 52 such votes in the year. In the end of every week, we will be advertising a winner video for a week.
Since our total budget for over a year is $1M, we will spend on average $20K per every week. In the beginning, we will be spending less every week, since we believe that quality of a video will improve with time, thanks to community feedback, and more in the later weeks.
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:59:32
Can you give specific examples how to improve ads? Can you describe what would you like to see in the ad?
@_date: 2016-12-07 02:43:18
Is there are spelling problems on video ads? If so, please give feedback on a comment below video on the site and authors would be able to improve in future.
@_date: 2016-12-07 06:36:25
Thank you for your feedback. In the beginning, we don't want to create any friction for voting.
I am not sure why Bitcoiners would pay to see a preview a month early?
@_date: 2016-12-08 01:41:01
Do you like to see long ads? People don't like long ads.
@_date: 2016-12-09 22:12:56
Have been playing with your idea, so far only got around with eggs
@_date: 2016-12-08 00:18:37
I like your idea. I think "shit" is not welcomed in ads. But i like messaging "Bitcoin - alternative savings". I hope I got messaging correctly. 
And it is good because disaster in first 5 seconds is very engaging.
Man, you are marketing genius. 
I guess this is scenario for any insurance company ads.
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:07:47
I think this is really bad metric
@_date: 2016-12-07 02:37:59
There is 2 type of people:
1) know that ads work
2) believe that ads did not work
As research shows, ads work better on second type of people.
@_date: 2016-12-08 01:02:36
Can you give specific example of better ad that you have in your mind?

I don't think that price of Bitcoin is good metric for answering this question. Better metrics would be brand awareness and number of merchandise that accept it, and number of transactions 
@_date: 2016-12-08 01:39:54

We run an experiment, we were giving away 5$, it cost us 5$ in ad money to give away 5$. Let me know, I can give you more explanation about our experiment and how you can reproduce it.
You can do an experiment by yourself, you can ask a random person on the street what they want 5$ bill or 10$ in Bitcoin. What would you think be result of this experiment?
@_date: 2016-11-08 00:45:11
10 people that need 10$ demand = 100$
100 people that need 1$ demand = 100$
@_date: 2016-12-08 01:34:30
We will be running a demand generation ad campaign. By running our ads we will make more people curious about Bitcoin. After that, you will be able to get better results with your demand fulfillment ad campaign for your startup.
@_date: 2016-12-07 06:21:08
I would say, if private key located on Mars, that I would say that your money is on Mars. Or you think that money will be on Earth?
Why it would be tricky to run a full node?
@_date: 2016-11-08 00:25:53
It's not true. If someone work on Bitcoin startup, they don't care about price, they care about adoption.
@_date: 2016-12-07 03:01:57
How about I will post link to ads placement in this comment in a week and you will have to comment that it is not a scam in this thread?
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:51:37
There are no such thing as "something as complex as" in a brand marketing. I will give you an example, do you know how Visa work? Nope, what you know is that if you have Visa on your credit card, you would be able to buy food.
You have a good advice to "tear down and start over again". And it exactly what will do more than 50 times during a year. Because every week we will have new video candidates.
You are totally right about "smack someone in the jaw in the first 5 seconds" and make them curious. I think Mars ads is going with this approach, it make them curious and a compelling reason to investigate deeper. Probably, mistake with Mars ads is that space topic make beyond a curious only small portion of people.
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:07:02
yep, what make bitcoin popular in the beginning is hurting it as well
@_date: 2016-12-07 02:41:03
Tell me how exactly Coca-Cola make you happy?
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:02:58
We are open for suggestions for improvements. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 00:11:06
So far we spend 0$. We will advertise the winner-video for 1000$. Next week there will be more videos to choose from, created based on a Bitcoin community feedback and we will advertise the winner-video for next week for 1000$ more. Once we see that a quality of ads improved and that branding message resonating with a Bitcoin community we will increase spending weekly limit.  Eventually we will get to 20K per week average.
@_date: 2016-12-07 06:33:32
This is a really good question, let me clarify what we are trying to achieve here.
We are on the mission for brand awareness (demand generation) for Bitcoin. In simple words, we want to switch a general person from a state "What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin for criminals." into state "How I get started with Bitcoin". 
 A brand awareness campaign usually using video ads. Usually, they are really short 15 or 30 seconds, because people don't want to see long ads videos. On the Internet, a big part of commercial videos consumed without sound. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 02:47:36
Thank you for your feedback, please comment your suggestions under the comments section on the site. You will see comments only after voting. We will be doing this every week and hope we will improve dramatically based on feedback from a community.
A format is limited, it is 15 seconds with few lines for ad messaging, we choose this format because we will allow to anyone from a community to put their video for voting and chance to be used in a promotion.
I think in coming week you will see that your comment about a contest are fully resonate with what we are doing.
We can not comment on the source of money for now.
@_date: 2016-12-09 21:48:13
I like your idea with fees, there so many different fees, so many content can be created
 - this one for foreign transaction fee
@_date: 2016-12-07 03:05:15
Thank you for your feedback. Can you make your feedback more actionable, so a quality of ad will be improving because of your feedback? Right now, authors of an ad will not be able to improve because they don't know what you exactly you don't like.
Keep in mind that a format of the ad is strict: 15 seconds videos with a few lines of messaging and branding in the end.
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:34:09
Thank you for your feedback. I would love to implement your idea next week. What would be messaging text for a video? I have in mind something like "Thousands of new job created", "Technology that bring new jobs"
Maybe something better on your mind?
@_date: 2016-12-07 06:10:22
Can you give examples of good ones?
* 15 seconds video
* No sound experience
* Targeting audience general US public
* It should be demand generation
P.S. Why my list did not render correctly?

At the point when a random person on street will choose $10 of bitcoin over a $5 note our mission of Bitcoin promotion will be accomplished.
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:30:41
We will be spending 1M over the year. We will be choosing a new video to run every week. A quality of the ad will improve, once we will incorporate a community feedback. If you have better ideas for next week videos, please comment on the site under videos and one of the author will be able to implement your idea.

Not true, prices can grow on speculation and big adoption for micropayments may not increase value.
