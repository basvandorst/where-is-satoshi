Bah humbug.
It's not Bitcoin because it's not the chain with most work, yet.
However, if you reject the validity of re-interpreting ANYONECANSPEND transactions in an unorthodox way and don't consider the block size to be a resource that's meant to be controlled by a single group of developers, then in fact BCH might be the _valid_ chain (for you) with the most work. It might be Bitcoin for _me_.
You'd do well to heed what Jameson Lopp wrote about everyone defining Bitcoin for themselves.

Your post is funny, but sorry, we are not changing the name. It's Bitcoin Cash, and will stay Bitcoin Cash until the day we get the most proof of work on our chain, or you guys fork off and change POW (talk to Cobra or Luke about it, seriously, your chances of increasing block weight further are slim to none given that you claim the majority of hashpower on your coin are those "evil miners" in you-know-where whom you royally pissed off.
The time of reckoning for BTC will come, even if only through its own bad economic decisions which we practically begged you for years to correct.
Bitcoin Cash has its own problems, and it seems we have attracted the buttcoiners and other parties who wanted to ensure Bitcoin fails. Funny how that is if it's not the real Bitcoin: a peer to peer electronic _cash_ system, right?


I know this thread is not the place about who has been defrauded and why, but my 2 satoshi says it's the people who believe BTC still meets the goals described in the whitepaper. That is my opinion, I stand by it, and so do many others. We experienced Bitcoin before blocks got full, we predicted what would happen when they did, we were right on all those counts. We will make sure the original goals are preserved even if it means we need to scale on the chain. We will make sure we CAN, and we will focus on Bitcoin Cash's usability as a currency.
Please before you try convince anyone of "stealing the name", please link to proof that you "own the name" first.

Trust me, I know you're trying to avoid calling it by it's proper name, Bitcoin Cash.
The 'bcash' client was created because having more network client implementations allows more people to interface and integrate (i.e. adopt) Bitcoin Cash and improves the robustness of its network.
Certainly no-one would go to the trouble of forking the 'bcoin' client just to let people spout crap.
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:23:33
I see you are still at the level of name-calling.

Fair point.
It's still called 'Bitcoin Cash' ��
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:30:24


That's right.


And you and everyone else is free to use it.


I disagree on both counts.
First, the 'Bitcoin' in its name expresses its direct lineage from Bitcoin, as evidenced by undisturbed UTXO from the genesis block up to 1 Aug 2017.
Unlike other forks which diluted the UTXO, pre-mined the remainder of the blocks and allocated them according to their own central plans, or permissioned access to users' own coins, just to mention a fraction of the REAL scams that have been propagated in the market yet are not being called out by people because no-one holding BTC (or BCH) is threatened by them.


Nope. And it will succeed on the basis of on-chain scaling and staying true to the goals described for Bitcoin in the white paper.
We don't need to split it into a settlement base layer with high fees, naturally centralized and effectively permissioned by making small outputs uneconomical to transact. We don't need to flange on a secondary layer to offload the main chain just yet, but we won't demonize offchain solutions either. They have their place, but they sacrifice some aspects of Bitcoin, aspects we like to maximize if possible.


It's largely the same miners. They don't shit where they eat. I'd be worried if I heard them saying that BTC is now only a short term profitability play for them. It speaks volumes about the trust lost by BTC developers.


It's quite easy, they're mostly the ones telling me to use Visa or Mastercard because Bitcoin is apparently not meant to be used as a currency.


Except it hasn't, objectively speaking. The Bitcoin Cash community largely rejects fraud in the strongest terms.
I am prepared to call it out when I see it, and the Bitcoin Cash developers are optimizing client software to reduce the likelihood of it (things like distinctive address format, work on double spend alerts / proofs etc).
However, someone calling Bitcoin Cash 'Bitcoin' is not fraud.
Someone selling you BCH for the price of a BTC (under current market conditions)? That I _would_ call fraud. However, nearly all websites and exchanges clearly label them as separate coins. Yet we do not control all websites and some scammers will exploit, just like they have done for BTC for years. I strongly condemn any scams.


BTC lost more than half its dominance before Bitcoin Cash developers finally forked. Sorry about the network effect damage, but BTC did that to itself. Remember December?


We did.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:11:53


Throwaway was making inaccurate statements about why the 'bcash' client was created. So I educated him on the real reasons for why multiple client implementations, including the 'bcash' client, are welcome and appreciated in Bitcoin Cash.
What is it that's confusing about that?
My delayed replies are due to posting limit restrictions I'm currently subjected to after having my factual posts downvoted in this sub. Or some other limiting mechanism that has been activated against my account on this sub.

First of all, it's not called Bcash, it's called Bitcoin Cash. I'll have to disagree with you and Amaury there, although he probably only used the term in order not to have his post censored off the front page. Amaury is clever like that. 
But he's no scammer, and neither is anyone involved with forking Bitcoin Cash.
We made sure it was a clean split, with as little confusion as possible.
It was not announced as anything else but a Bitcoin fork, and always represented as 'Bitcoin Cash' on the websites that offered the software.
It's true there are people who believe, sincerely, that Bitcoin Cash is more 'Bitcoin' than the BTC coin nowadays.
It's also true that they were in a minority at the time of the fork, and still are.
But they have a right to call it 'Bitcoin' just as much as you do to call BTC 'Bitcoin'.
Neither are using the same consensus rules that were in effect on 31 July 2017. The old 'Bitcoin' is dead.
Two things happened:
- One hard-fork (now Bitcoin Cash, called 'Bcash' by some such as yourself)
- One soft-fork (now called Bitcoin, or Bitcoin Core by some)
Both forks were highly controversial and contentious. Segwit (the soft-fork) failed to gain consensus through ordinary means, it only got consensus through subterfuge (majority miners agreeing to it on condition that a subsequent HF to 2MB base block size also happens, aka the NYA).
Now we're at the point where is accusing Bitcoin Cash of stealing its name when it should be obvious to anyone involved in Bitcoin that no-one owns the name of the coin, it's a permissionless system and when Bitcoin Cash gains the majority hashpower and chain with most proof of work, everyone is entitled to call it Bitcoin.
I'm not saying people should call it Bitcoin before then, but I'll defend to the death their right to do so.
@_date: 2018-08-07 18:50:23


We obviously disagree. There is no other fork of Bitcoin that focused on on-chain scaling and adoption as a currency while preserving the UTXO prior to the Segwit soft-fork.
I agree that Bitcoin Cash should be called Bitcoin Cash, but even more so I defend others' right to call it whatever they want. That includes 'Bitcoin' if they wish. Personally, I won't call it that until such time as BTC changes its proof of work or falls behind in the amount of SHA256d work on its chain.

@_date: 2018-08-07 22:05:33
If you research the facts, you will find that the 'bcash' term was coined in advance of the fork date and propagated by a small group of accounts using dedicated domain, subreddit, Twitter etc. in a dedicated push to derail the success of the future Bitcoin Cash and to create the impression of a legitimate grass-roots concern about the naming.
I consider it hypocritical to make a fuss about the 'Bitcoin Cash' name and start a campaign to rename it even before it has forked, while acting completely differently towards all the other Bitcoin forks that follow the 'Bitcoin XXXX' naming scheme, and also kicking up a fuss when people call BTC 'Bitcoin Core' (that one was actually Bitfinex too who came up with it) or 'Bcore'. And I say that as a long time Bitcoin user. People need mirrors all around and start thinking for themselves.
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:16:12
False on two counts:
- he wasn't the only developer (you'll see commits by others there in github too if you bother to check)
- it's only an airdrop by an extremely twisted definition. Airdrop used to mean you get free tokens on some chain. However, everyone who got BCH during the fork paid for it already through their BTC holdings. In the same way you already own your coins on all (fair) hard forks of BTC that preserve its UTXO.
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:42:51
I don't know, I saw a thread by here calling it 'BCash' and I thought I'll offer some additional information.
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:39:20


No he wasn't. Inform yourself please. He was (and is) the lead developer on Bitcoin ABC, the most prominent Bitcoin Cash client on the network, and the one used by most BCH mining power (and I believe mined the first Bitcoin Cash block).
I personally know of at least 10 developers who contributed to Bitcoin ABC to assist Amaury with commits prior to 1 August (not to mention BU, Classic and XT developers who also readied their clients to participate in the Bitcoin Cash fork on 1 August 2017):
- Mengerian,
- Awemany, 
- sickpig, 
- dagurval, 
- kyuupichan, 
- hanchon, 
- Mateo Friedman, 
- NilacTheGrim, 
- gbrown, 
- myself (ftrader)
I'm counting from Amaury's first commit 5b641923 and up to the fork date. You know how to use git, right?
If I'm going to start counting the devs from other clients and those devs who reviewed or assisted in other ways, we'll soon be at 30, I guess.


There doesn't have to be. Hard fork chain splits don't work like that. Sorry to disillusion you :-)
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:56:24
All this time you're steering the discourse on this sub to promote only the view that 'Bcash is a scammy altcoin!' and non-negative discussion of it is usually removed speedily.
That's my definition of literal manipulation - creating an echo chamber where only certain views are allowed - and in your other post in this thread you claim holding certain opinions could constitute 'fraud'. On very shaky legal basis there I would say, but on par for 'thoughtcrime' and 'wrongthink'.

I wonder how many people would have a problem with calling it by its proper name, 'Bitcoin Cash', if it weren't for a continuous campaign of disinformation and renaming which even started prior to the fork.
EDIT: I am now rate limited in which didn't seem to be the case just before. How weird.

With a 5TB hard drive (which isn't that expensive), that could store ~5e6 1mb blocks which is about ~34,000 days worth, or ~95 years.
Before that time runs out, solutions like Lightning Network would be fully developed and reduce the demand on that poor drive tremendously.

So they wouldn't have to license AsicBoost at all.

Thanks. The suggestion to point to alternative hard forks or resources which give good overview is definitely good.

@_date: 2017-06-10 08:12:32
Good point.
What will be helpful is a publicly scrutinizable test plan which people can check against the proposed changes, so that they may have confidence that things are being tested correctly.
Of course, it needs experts to review the actual code and tests, to see if something might be missed.
That's why I included "links to client implementations" - they need to publicise this sort of information.
Of course, this really applies to any type of fork client release (hard / soft / synthetic / firm / evil / twisted ... :-)
