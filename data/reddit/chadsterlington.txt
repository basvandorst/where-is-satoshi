@_date: 2018-06-13 21:46:27
Here is my counterpoint:
Is Bitcoin doomed? Yes.
BAM, counterpoint! And I provided as much of a source and explanation as the original post. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:30:20
It's been a long time since i've been on there, but I vaguely remember it being a running joke. Someone would post, "I won $5k this weekend!!" and the first reply would be, "Yeah, but how much did you lose?"
I don't remember one specific post. Maybe it just spread after that. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:47:39
Cool? Ok. Useful? Not really. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:40:20
Thanks for the response. I agree that an issue now is that everybody is obsessed with the value of bitcoin and trying to get rich quick instead of thinking about it's use as an actual currency. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:47:05
Or we could be saying, remember 20 years ago when people thought bitcoin was going to be the next big thing?? It's worth .03 now. 
If you believe in it, buy it. I won't fault you for that. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:09:03
Some good points, thanks for the reply. A common point i'm seeing is that it is much more important in developing nations that might have more corrupt banking systems. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:28:35
Yup, I agree with you. Don't they say if you have to explain a joke, it isn't funny? Well if you have read the white paper to understand why bitcoin is valuable......
Anyway, I agree that as soon as the next tech trend comes along, people will forget about bitcoin. My point was that there has to be a legitimate use for it in order for people to adopt and I just don't see that. Sure, people might hold it for a little longer as an "investment", but that's it. 
It's supposed to be a currency. Does anyone pay their rent with it? No. Get paid in it? No. Buy groceries with it? No. Hypothetically, if they do, is it a better alternative to paying via check, c/c or cash? No. Is it a better alternative for peer to peer transfer than something like venmo or paypal? No. So even if it does gain some traction, I don't see it being a better alternative to technology and methods that are already out there. People can use buzzwords like "decentralized" and "blockchain technology" all they want, but most people don't care about that. 
I do agree with you that it could be used for wire transfers or international transactions on a small scale, but I just don't see it being commonplace. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:37:36
I know your comment was not a direct reply to my original post, but I feel like maybe you think i'm here to troll. If so, that's not the case at all. I guess my intention was to give everybody a glimpse of on an outsiders first impression of bitcoin. I personally didn't see the need for it and can't see myself using it in the foreseeable future. Just my opinion. I genuinely wanted people to show me what I was missing, because I don't understand all the hype. If that's not considered an acceptable discussion than I apologize, but if you want every conversation to revolve around praising bitcoin....well, that's just called an echo chamber. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:51:44
Well my opinion is in the original post. Maybe I should have said bitcoin is not ready for mainstream adoption instead of bitcoin is pointless. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:02:35
Understandable, I think a lot of people hate on bitcoin because they missed out on the bubble, and now that it's dropped they want to come in and say, "I told you so!". 
That's not me, i'm just trying to genuinely understand where people see the need for bitcoin in our lives. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:55:36
Not claiming to be an expert in currencies. I guess my post was meant to be taken from my perspective, as an American who doesn't conduct international business or deal in foreign currencies. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:52:55
Just trying to have a conversation and better understand why people see value in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:15:41
I'd argue that scanning a QR code and inserting a card will take roughly the same amount of time.
Also, is an irreversible transaction always a good thing? I can see it being good for a merchant in terms of chargebacks....but what about as a consumer that was legitimately screwed over by a merchant? Most credit card companies offer protection against this, where bitcoin wouldn't. 
Lastly, I agree, bitcoin and other crypto still have a "wild west" feel to them. Unless that changes, I can't see it becoming mainstream. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:03:43
That's a good response actually, thanks. I guess in my opinion it just needs to be easier to use, more widely accepted, and stable. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:21:04
Sure, it is. How many international wire transfers do you send? Maybe it's a solution to a problem that most people don't have. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:53:49
Ok, I get it, growing up in the US I can't possibly understand the financial issues most of the world faces. Yes, you're absolutely right. Maybe, I should have phrased my original text to say that I think bitcoin is pointless TO ME, but may not be pointless to everyone. 
I guess, I would just ask you one additional question, and i'm genuinely curious. So multiple people are stating that bitcoin is more purposeful in places like venezuela, brazil or cuba. Ok, so is it actually helping people there? Bitcoin is live and available. Are their lives improving as a result? Or are you saying that bitcoin or a decentralized currency could have helped them avoid this mess, but it's too late now? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:09:59
Valid points. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 03:43:52
no, it's not. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:01:07
It's a little different. Actually, it's a lot different. Even if bitcoin was ultra fast, I still wouldn't have a need for it. Maybe others do, but I don't. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:56:23
That could be true. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:35:54
I see your point. I was taught that generally for an idea to take off and be adopted, it has to solve a problem. Is that true in every instance? No. My point is just that the reason bitcoin isn't experiencing mass adoption is because it's a solution to a problem that most people don't have. Just my opinion. 
And yes, I was ten years old 20 years ago so my standard of living certainly has decreased.
@_date: 2019-01-13 04:26:16
Ok, I assume you, like most others on this sub, are under the assumption that bitcoin ultimately has to go up in value no matter what. It doesn't. Just because you personally believe something does not make it fact. Just because you believe that it is the future of currency does not mean that it is. There are countless investors out there that go broke every single day because they truly believed they had discovered the next big thing, but they hadn't. 
Bitcoin does not have to go up. It could go all the way down to nothing and never recover. So, it's not "always good to buy some bitcoins every year regardless of price". It's just not. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:55:47
Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:24:49
There is nothing wrong with getting into it to make money. It's no different than any other investment.
I feel like most bitcoin enthusiasts are like you....they want to make money. They are high on bitcoin, because they want to get rich, not because they truly believe it's going to be the currency of the future. Look at 99% of the posts on crypto...they are about buying lambos and going to the moon. Not as many thoughtful posts about why bitcoin is going to succeed. And when you question them, you just get, "because decentralization!" or "because blockchain!" without really much understanding or explanation. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:31:14
Thanks, i'll check it out when I get a chance. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 03:53:29
This is from a post I wrote almost a year ago: 
 
I am well aware that this will be an unpopular opinion here, but maybe i'm looking for someone to change my mind. I've been interested in the idea of bitcoin and the technology behind it since I first heard about it years ago. Admittedly, I'm no expert on bitcoin or blockchain technology in general, but you shouldn't have to be to want to adopt it. Example - I don't have to be a mechanic to see how an automobile would benefit my life.
Anyway, while the idea is fascinating to me, I don't really see a point. I went to business school with a focus on entrepreneurship and when it comes to "inventing", we were always told to create something that solves a problem. Exactly what problem is bitcoin solving?
You might say, "well, it's decentralized". So what? What issue am I having with my "centralized" US dollar? None. Is the fear that the USD will collapse? I don't see that happening in my lifetime....but I have seen bitcoin collapse multiple times.
Ok, well I read an article about how bitcoin is taking off in Africa because their local currencies are very unstable and prone to hyper-inflation. This would make sense to me.....again, if bitcoin were stable, but it's not. It's down 22% over the past week. Wouldn't these people have had better luck converting their money into USD or gold?
So you might say, well it's anonymous (I'm not sure if that's even true). Again, ok, so what problem is that solving? Unless I'm doing something illegal, do I really care about this? No. The last peer to peer transaction I conducted was sending my sister $50 to reimburse her for a gift card. It doesn't need to be anonymous. I don't care if the whole world knows. I used facebook to send it. I've never sent money through facebook before and it literally took me 30 seconds with no fees.
That brings me to my next point. Bitcoin is slow. Last week I decided to put my money where my mouth is and (attempt to) make a bitcoin purchase through Newegg. It was honestly kind of a pain in the ass. Once I had the wallet all set up, I went to coinbase to buy my bitcoin. Had to verify identity and bank account, which took a couple days and didn't feel very anonymous. Then I went to buy my bitcoin....oh, it's going to take a week before I can actually access my coins?? That's stupid. Guess what also happened in that week? Bitcoin went from $8700 to $6800. Awesome!
Then I went to send the money to my wallet. Ok, that also takes forever. While I was waiting for it to confirm, I started reading up on the delays. I saw that during the bitcoin rush, it could take days for transactions to confirm. Also, you can pay a higher fee to have your transaction confirm faster. Ok, that's stupid. Anyway, the whole process of getting set up to buy bitcoin was annoying and drawn out and again, for what benefit? I planned on making a purchase through Newegg. I could have just used my credit card and completed the purchase in seconds. Instead, I waited weeks and ultimately decided to wait in hopes that the value of bitcoin comes back up first. Fun.
So lets talk about the fees. I've seen people say, but the fees are so low!! Ok, well again, I sent my sister money on facebook for no fee. If I used my credit card on new egg I wouldn't have paid a fee and could actually earn 1-2% or other various rewards depending on my card. Oh, but the merchant has to pay a credit card processing fee. Yes this is true......but if I were a merchant, I would much rather pay a 2% fee than deal with the insane volatility of bitcoin. Again, as a merchant let's say I sold $9,000 worth of product and was paid in bitcoin last week. That's now worth less than $7,000. Nah, i'll pay the 2%. Also, i've seen that when bitcoin volume is high, fees go through the roof....and what if you are trying to use it at a brick and mortar store, but you have to wait 2 hours for the transaction to confirm....yeah, no thanks.
Admittedly, I don't know much about the new lightning network. Maybe it solves the high fees and long delays, but again, what benefit does it offer versus using traditional fiat? As much as I want to see a reason, I can't, and therefore I don't see mass adoption of bitcoin happening anytime soon. I think the hype around bitcoin has mostly been based on speculation and a lot of people trying to get rich quick, but when it comes to the practicality of bitcoin, I just don't see it.
If someone can tell me why I would ever benefit from using bitcoin over fiat (in the US) then maybe i'd change my mind, but until then I see bitcoin as a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:09:11
That's fair. I can see how it would make more sense in countries that are less stable. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:08:22
No and No. Again, I wrote this as my own opinion based on my own experiences. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:16:45
Oh hey, i'm an old twoplustwo member. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:48:20
Mathematics and speculation. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:58:08
Just because you can't "print more bitcoin" doesn't mean it's immune to speculation or extreme volatility. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:30:03
Ok couple things - Aren't miners essentially intermediaries that are profiting from bitcoin transactions? You would have more of an argument here if there were no fees with bitcoin, but there are. In fiat, sure there is a merchant processing fee for credit card transactions, but no fees when using cash or check. Merchant processor or miner, what's the difference? Both getting a cut of the transaction. 
Next, I hear your argument that a digital token is more efficient than a paper token. I'm a bit of an environmentalist so I don't like the idea of clear cutting forests for paper. But a couple counterpoints - USD obviously doesn't have to used in a paper form. I very rarely use cash. Also, I don't know the exact numbers here, but doesn't the bitcoin network consume an absolutely insane amount of power? I wouldn't call that efficient either....
I'm not sure what your argument is for a decentralized system being more efficient? Also, if it is more efficient, does it come at the cost of stability? What's more important?
Lastly, i'm trying to look at bitcoin from a practical perspective because that's the only way people will ever adopt it, so valuation does matter. You are right, it's value is based on market demand, but it is far from arbitrary. Let's say you work for a hip new tech company and they pay you in bitcoin. Awesome! Your salary is X amount of bitcoin every year. Ok, well in December 2017 X amount of bitcoin would have bought you a lambo. Today, X amount of bitcoin will maybe buy you a Kia. Your salary hasn't changed, but your purchasing power has. In a way, you're right, valuation doesn't matter.....because nobody is actually using bitcoin! If it were actually being used a currency (which is what it's supposed to be right?) than valuation would absolutely matter. If you say that the value of a currency is arbitrary, then argument over. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:55:55
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:28:39
You're not wrong. I made sure I was very clear in saying that this was just my opinion. In my life right now there is no need for something like bitcoin. That may be different for others. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:31:54
Nice response, thank you. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:13:18
Ok, common response i'm getting is that it is very useful in less developed countries. Maybe I should have said I don't see the point here in the US. 
But no, merchant processing fees are 2-3%, not 8%. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:29:41
I see your first point, but I think it's a little misleading. Essentially you're saying $1.00 today is worth 95% less than it was 100 years ago, because of inflation? I haven't verified that, but assuming it's true there are other factors at play. Sure, if you just put your money under your mattress for 100 years, you would get screwed. But most people put their money in an account that's going to have some sort of return. Even a savings account can get you 1.45% today. If you put your money in the S&amp;P it would have grown 14% over the past year, and that's at a much faster rate than inflation. 
I understand not everybody can afford to invest their money, but even wages are constantly increasing (albeit, not always at the same rate as inflation, which I do think is a problem). Basically my point is, sure a dollar went a long way in 1910, but the average salary was also $400/year. 
I do agree with you regarding government spending and the out-of-control deficit....but I still haven't quite grasped that bitcoin is a solution to that, in a practical sense. I'm not an expert in economics so maybe I just haven't connected the dots here. 
Anyway, thanks for the response. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:15:36
Am not. Why would I ever use bitcoin? A lot of the answers are...."Well if you're a poor farmer in Brazil..." or "If you need to send money to your brother in Russia".... Ok, well those don't apply to me. Maybe bitcoin has a purpose for others, but I guess it doesn't for me. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:27:23
Well I appreciate your honesty. And you're absolutely right, I haven't done nearly enough research to have a legitimate opinion on bitcoin. But I guess that was also part of my point. I think I represent a majority of people out there that haven't done all the research and see absolutely no reason to adopt this technology. Sure, there is a small group that is really excited about this, but that's not the mainstream opinion. I believe for bitcoin to be successful, there has to be mass adoption. 
I was upfront about my lack of understanding, but that brings me back to one of my first points. 
You don't have to be a mechanic to see the value of an automobile. You don't have to be a computer nerd to see the value of a computer.....but apparently you have to be incredibly well versed in blockchain technologies to see the value of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:14:56
Yes, that's exactly how I feel. Albeit, an impressive solution, but I'm still not sure what the problem is. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:25:39
I don't know. I assume not. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:22:09
That's a good point. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:36:28
Ok so you are right that the USD is only backed by the US. If we lose our position in the world, the USD will suffer, no doubt about that. 
But I guess the way I see it is that at least it is backed by something. Bitcoin is backed by nothing, by design. Sure I can see some pros to that.....but it also seems to open it up to extreme volatility and instability, as we are witnessing now. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:04:11
Just trying to have a conversation man. You don't need to start hurling insults. Anyway, curious why you don't think volatility is an issue? Bitcoin is down 25% over the past week. If you were a merchant accepting bitcoin or an employee being paid in bitcoin, wouldn't that be a major problem? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:44:27
I thought you were being sarcastic at first, but I see that you aren't Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:08:46
True, but even though my money is in USD, it's not in cash. I'm not driving around with 10k in my car. I have heard that baseless police seizures are a problem though. 
Also, it does sound like bitcoin makes sending money internationally much easier. I've never had to do this, but certainly others have. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:41:42
Are you fucking retarded?
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:11:21
It's impressive, but I don't see a lot of practical applications yet. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:29:31
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:25:53
I wrote a long post on this the other day. It's not that I don't understand bitcoin, it's that I have absolutely no use for it. To me, bitcoin is a solution in search of a problem. What problem am I currently facing that bitcoin can solve? I can't think of one. This is where most people tell me to look outside of the US to perhaps countries that are facing hyper inflation. Ok, so tell me, what solution is bitcoin offering to the people of Venezuela, because last I checked they are still starving. Then this is where people usually say, well you can transfer money internationally faster and with a lower fee. Ok, cool. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:28:06
No, it's not. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:07:34
Understandable, but there are also other assets in which people could store value that are less volatile.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:48:27
That's not true. Could be worth nothing in five years. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:42:15
Depends. Does the local grocery store actually accept bitcoin? Can I buy gas with bitcoin in Venezuela? Pay my rent? I'm legitimately asking, because a currency sounds pretty useless if you can't spend it. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:43:57
I call BS. How large of a company is this that is paying 80% of their employees in BTC? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:54:36
Is there something wrong with warning people?
