So you agreed then with the other employee, that Bitcoin Cash was a good buy  That's nice! 
Yeah, definitely that's a good buy. We'll all be seeing BCH going back to within a 5-to-1 exchange ratio under Bitcoin again just like in the good ol' days of 2017. You know what's an even bigger steal, tho, is Bitcoin Gold at a mere pittance of under USD $30! Good ol' BTG'll be reclaiming its spot in the top-10 range here soon enough. But the one that's REALLY gonna surprise the heck out of everyone is when the Mighty Dogecoin hits $50 and sacks the whole bunch of them! (LoL) ALL ABOARD!!����

So the alleged bank was being supportive of Bitcoin. There are a few. The bank I use is a comparatively very small bank as banks go; and although it has never been vocally supportive of Bitcoin to my knowledge, it has also never been critical of it. I've used them for years now to make exchanges in cryptocurrencies to fiat and vice versa. I even went in one day and verbally advised them I would be doing so. They just said -- "OK." That was it. Never a question one way or the other. But I think they like the fact I have ended up running a lot of money thru them...

Adoption is a relative term that is not necessarily reliant on "love" being a present emotion, although in this case it may be. We just don't know.
In similar terms, and as you are likely aware, the old adage of, "I LOVE MONEY" is one that has been passed down through countless generations. Probably Donald Trump has said, "I LOVE MONEY!" 
In reality, though, for most people who will ever utter those very words, it isn't actually the money specifically that they love, but rather where they love what money can do for them, such as buy them a car or a house. On rare occasions, there will also be people who have a sexual attraction to money, such as with wanting to have sex on top of a big pile of $100 bills, or even $1 bills, or maybe in a bathtub full of nickels. (Such odd fetishes, while rare, do indeed exist. Please Google the phrase, "PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEX WITH THEIR CARS" to bone up on the subject.)
And to be sure, the vast majority of us have indeed "adopted" use of money out of necessity. Even so, many people who have adopted use of money actually hate money nonetheless, or they hate what money stands for in certain terms. To wit, the Holy Bible says that, "Money is at the root of all evil."
So the person responsible for "adopting" use of the signage in this illustration may hold a deep affection for Bitcoin (we can call that "love") in the same context that people will claim to hold a love for money. OR the person may fantasize about having sex on top of a pile of Bitcoin paper wallets. Who knows, right? We just don't know what possible quirky ideology this person has in mind.
The bottom line, though, like I say, is that whether a love for something is inclusive of adoption is the same as trying to define what one person's love for meat &amp; potatoes is compared to someone else. Ideologies between people can be very peculiar in that way.
In offering to clarify, though, I would say that a love of Bitcoin in any case may accurately be described as a form of adoption depending on who you ask. Whether you agree or not personally merely highlights the attenuated nature of idiosyncratic ideologies that exist to presuppose an answer to question in the first place. In other words, any given answer to the question is clearly open to bias.
In summary, I think the best adage would simply be to say, "If the shoe fits, then wear it."
Does that make sense? ��

The consideration made for hyperinflation on the dollar was "inferred" in my original comment per the TITLE of the actual post itself by the person who posted it. Did you notice the term was used in the title?
I made an inference to the subject of the post referencing an ideal of hyperinflation. NO, I didnt spell it out there, because most people know an inference when they read one. You need to know how to read &amp; comprehend inferences. If you don't know how to do that then I can't help you. 
Then in literally ALL my comments back to you, I specified the term "HYPERINFLATION" with respect to fiat money specifically. In those comments, I was VERY specific concerning fiat money...(lol)

The thing is, though, that there's no compelling reason to buy Bitcoin outside of speculation. The same is generally true of gold, where it's only worth what people are willing to pay. 
However, it's not specifically true of gold, since gold still has more actual real-world value &amp; utility than Bitcoin does, whereas it's used not only in industrial applications and to fill cavities in teeth, but also as jewelry. You can say Bitcoin is a "store of value," but that's nothing more than a philosophical ideal. The Aztec Indians used "cocoa beans" as money, including to suggest the beans were a store of value in the sense that, if nothing else, you could still eat them.
If massive hyperinflation were to ever affect the U.S. Dollar to the extent that it affected the German Mark before it, or even the Zimbabwean Dollar nowadays, then the speculative value of Bitcoin could in theory go to $5 billion. But comparing what $5 billion buys today to what it would buy if inflation on the U.S. Dollar ever hit 200 million percent, is factually like comparing apples &amp; oranges. You wouldn't be able to compare the two. 
All I can presume at this point is that you don't seem to understand what hyperinflation is and how it affects commodity prices such as gold, oil, soybeans, wheat, or even Bitcoin for that matter...��

Yeah, I'm sure you're right about the tax exemption only applying after the fact. I gather the YouTuber guy from the "Colin Talks Crypto" channel lives there.

It might just be a years' long tax-planning strategy where his intention is to move back to the states at some point (like after Bitcoin blows up).
He's shown some general evidence to suggest he's likely pretty well endowed with quite a few Bitcoins and other altcoins, though he's never given out any specific numbers. He's apparently been in the space since 2011.

People on this group just make up the rules as they go along. That's even true of so-called "moderators" who will get their panties in a jam if a posted item so much as hints of "altcoins" even indirectly. The subject matter MUST only involve Bitcoin in the strictest sense of the word lest ye be guilty of blasphemy in the 1st degree! 
That said, though, I once posted a picture of a Jaguar sports car driving in front of me with its license plate showing "BTC" of all things. I thought it was pretty cool &amp; unique, while at the same time obviously only having trivial value to the subject of Bitcoin, as in "humorous" to an extent.  
But people post plenty of inconsequential material here, like with THIS VERY POST for instance! You tell me what intrinsic value this "humorous" post here has for the deadly serious Bitcoin topic...It has NONE!!
So anyway, my "BTC" license plate photo was immediately flagged &amp; removed under the pretense of being irrelevant to the suggested hard-core, dictator-like philosophy behind this group. I suspect that had the car in question been a Lamborghini then most definitely my post would have never been cited for deletion, since "LAMBOS &amp; BITCOIN" are perceived to be the epitome of defining Bitcoin wealth . My only thought was -- "PHUCK OFF!!" 
So any given moderator at any given time can get a hair up his ass and flag posts for deletion just like this one here. Some make it thru while others don't. Had I posted my "BTC" license photo on another day it would have passed muster with someone else who is inclined to be a little less of a screwball. Clowns at work...��

You are referring to a "LEGACY" Bitcoin address at the time. You know that, right? They don't make those anymore. In any case, the point you're apparently missing is that, providing a Bitcoin public address is entered correctly into literally any blockchain explorer, it will never produce false results. SEGWIT doesn't matter here.
And you're here saying that, "It happens all the time." So where is the evidence of that? I'm telling you that you can't produce the evidence. You can't.

Talk about getting worked up and just going on, and on, and on, and on. You're an antagonist is what you are. That's very apparent. So otherwise, you are apparently admitting here to holding more than one Reddit account. That is against the Reddit guidelines. They will ban all your accounts for doing so, including to ban your IP address(es).
But I don't click on links sent from ANYONE! That's a practice I've employed for many, many years on the Internet. So on top of everything else, you're a pathological liar. I can't even recall the last time I received a link from someone thru this platform, although I have received them in the past. But I never click on them. So like I say, you're a pathological liar.
You're also suggesting here that you don't read more than the opening &amp; closing statements of comments made here, or at least in this case that's what you are saying. So it's no wonder you're confused. Why read ANYTHING at all if you're not going to read enough to be informed about anything you are offering comments on?

I made a simple initial comment comparing hyperinflation to the effects that it has on commodity prices, and what could happen to the Bitcoin commodity price if the U.S. Dollar were to ever hyperinflate, and because of that I get fucking retards making nonsensical arguments for buying "bread factories." Even the title of the post itself is obviously making a point for the effects of hyperinflation. So it's not like I was being off-topic with my comment.
Then I get more retards like yourself coming along who are rambling on &amp; on with incoherent verbiage about all these various fiat currencies while evidently still not understanding how the effects of hyperinflation directly correlate to commodity prices.
You are an embarrassment to your momma is what you are, son. Go home to your momma is where you belong. As for me, I made a personal fortune from fucking Bitcoin (enough to retire on) from a meager $5,000 investment made back in December 2016; and I fully expect to make a WHOLE LOT more meaningful money in the months to come (assuming hyperinflation doesn't wreck the party). 
Can you say the same thing for yourself? Were you able to create a personal fortune from a tiny investment made into ANYTHING at all? I doubt it! And while there were a few people like me who came out on top the way I did with this Bitcoin thing, it was goddamn few. So like I say, go home to your momma, boy...��

Sounds to me like you're getting rather frantic here; talking in broken and irrational terms; spewing out nonsensical gibberish and clearly baseless rhetoric to imply guilt or maybe even criminal activity of some sort on my part; and just struggling overall to keep your composure in working fervently to control this conversation. But you are losing at best, bro! And at worst you've really already lost, which I certainly do see where it's come to that.
I'm talking about tracking the transaction lineage for any given Bitcoin public address(es) through the blockchain using something even as simple as the BLOCKCHAIR.com website that cannot reasonably be disputed, or even using something more sophisticated like the CHAINALYSIS.com platform if need be. And I'm frankly NOT believing that you don't get that picture, because I definitely do believe that you get it.
Last I knew anyway, the CHAINALYSIS site is the one most relied upon by law enforcement agencies to track Bitcoin transactions throughout the history of the blockchain, like dating back to the SILKROAD debacle for instance, or at least where that was the pioneering organization in the field of commercialized blockchain forensics. It wouldn't even surprise me to know that it was also that same organization most recently used to bust the alleged massive child porn ring you might have heard about in the news over the past few days using Bitcoin as its said preferred method of payment.
Anyway, you're evidently stammering really badly here, bro, and frankly it's obvious where you've now resorted to talking rather nasty to me in terms with your apparent snide remarks, innuendo and accusatory language. I've been asking you some very pointed and deliberate questions that you are consistently evading even up to the point of essentially now acting uncivil towards me within the scope of this conversation.
No matter, though, bro. So let me tell you this much: I know a great deal about the technology behind cryptocurrencies, for which I also know most users of it actually know very little. I'm not even close to being an idiot on this stage; and your attitude is not acceptable to me.
Oftentimes, though, as a matter of psychology, it's people like you who are out pointing fingers and making baseless accusations against people, as well as becoming unraveled emotionally like you've demonstrated here, who are themselves the ones guilty of some form of criminal wrongdoing or mischief. As for me in any case, I am overwhelmingly educated enough about both cryptography in general, as well as to be highly educated about the use and deployment of cryptocurrencies, that I honestly do know much better than to think I could ever outwit the FBI - or even the IRS - in any of this.
You are a genuine buffoon, dude. That's really abundantly clear at this point. You're a real clown.

Well of course it'll end that way. You know that much. But don't worry about it in the midterm: First they'll figure out a way to pile 40% of the world's debt obligations into Bitcoin. Once you see it going into employee retirement accounts (think "401K" in the U.S.), state &amp; union pension funds, ETFs, insurance funds, real estate derivatives &amp; credit swaps, and last but not least -- bank-style "fractional lending," then you can start to worry a little. A single satoshi will be worth like $50, or $5 billion per Bitcoin. The term "billionaire" will be old-school wealth by that time, as "trillionaires" and even "quadrillionaires" become relatively commonplace. Then when the ultimate collapse finally DOES come, it will knock the world's financial infrastructure to its knees like nothing you can imagine. Past financial crisis events like the 1929 Great Depression &amp; 2008 Great Recession will look like mere blips on the radar. Less than 500 people will take the bulk of the money and run. In the meantime, though, if you're fortunate enough to be holding at least ONE Bitcoin, and providing you don't sell too soon, then you should be able to avoid destitute poverty alongside the masses. Good luck...

Granted, based on human-edited charts &amp; graphs that can readily be exploited at will, then yes, it's well known. Also based on Google Search results it's well known. And not to forget mentioning based on the good word of folks like Mr. Roger Ver, it's also well known. 
Nice work here, though, skirting the hard facts of the issue like a true politician. Because you still can't produce any examples (not even ONE) of a valid Bitcoin public addresses (much less dozens of them back to back) being input into any blockchain explorer that produced erroneous results. And I'm saying you can't produce that kind of evidence for ANY reason, not just this reason.
But at least answer this question: If you could be shown the same evidence existing on multiple other blockchain explorer sites, like for instance with those two (2) particular ones that are respectively dedicated to both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, then how would that affect your outlook here???
@_date: 2019-10-10 18:45:15
You wrote "LARGELY" off topic, which is actually a distinction in terms implying that altcoins are not specifically - or "ALWAYS" - off topic, just that they are usually off topic. 
Does that mean, for instance, that Ethereum CAN be in part to a broader discussion providing the discussion also involves consideration made about Bitcoin, OR does it mean such ideals of duality within the broader context of any given topic or topics involving cryptocurrencies CANNOT be discussed based on an immutable exclusivity made for regarding Bitcoin? Because if the latter ideal is the case here, then your usage of the word "LARGELY" is misleading and effectively amounts to a misnomer.
So please clarify! Thank you -- and have a nice day...

NICE!! I'll put November 5th on my calendar! In the meantime, at 7:41 AM (Pacific Time) this morning, I called an interim price bottom for the overall market in general with Bitcoin in particular sitting at $7,967.83 based on the COINCAP aggregator. So with that in mind, the Bitcoin price should not fall below that level anytime soon, as my prediction calls for a significant &amp; indefinite rally going forward.
My predictions, which have historically been quite accurate to within a 5-minute window and are based on a composite calculation known ONLY to me (or at least I've never seen evidence of the composite being demonstrated elsewhere), don't tend to make an allowance for time frames exceeding 1 or 2 days other than to make note of general trending (i.e., up or down trends). 
That being said, I've never figured out how to predict - with any reliable degree of accuracy - a reasonably distant timeframe like November 5th that you've suggested here. So that is intriguing to me, and I'll definitely be anticipating the date...������

They don't actually necessarily (plan to). Typically anyway, the idea with these things is to just take the money and run. $8 million still not too bad of a payday, but coulda been better. Unfortunately, these heist projects just ain't what used to be back in '17 raising hundreds of millions in a matter of days, or even hours.

@_date: 2019-10-21 09:31:43
What do you even mean by "pre-fork transactions"? There's no such thing, dude! You can Google any number of combination of phrases using the term "pre-fork" and literally nothing comes up. Try the terms "blockchain, bitcoin, hard fork" or anything else in that context and it produces a complete dead end on Google search. 
I know there are a whole lot of people who go around just making things up as they see fit to suit their needs and arguments in trying to look smart and educated about different things when really they are anything but smart and educated. Are you another one of those? You don't even bother to explain what it is you're even talking about.
A transaction on the blockchain either happens or it doesn't happen. There is no such thing as a "pre-fork transaction." There apparently just isn't. I looked and it doesn't exist.
When you initiate a SEND transaction on the blockchain, the only time you even see a date &amp; time stamp in the IN/OUT field is at the time the transaction is sent and confirmed, not before that and obviously not 1 month or 3 months after the fact. 
And a "confirmation" for a SEND transaction on the blockchain is also just that: it's a confirmation. I know the Bitcoin blockchain is slow sometimes, but it's definitely NOT slow by three freaking months to get a total of six (6) or more full confirmations.
So again, what are you saying? Are you suggesting that those "confirmed" transactions on the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold blockchains showing through the article screenshots were sent out 1 and 3 months in advance of the hard forks? Is that what you are arguing is a pre-fork transaction?
If that is what you're arguing, then you are sadly very wrong. That's not what happened. Those transactions were "confirmed" and the funds received in the wallets on the date and time shown on the blockchain transaction ledger. And that is all it was. You can't say those dates are intended to mean something else extraordinary in your mind, because the only thing they represent is receipt of the funds that were sent.
Also, are you really serious to imagine that someone would actually be stupid enough to go to such great lentghs in documenting a situation like that in the interest of trying to circumvent an understanding of tax guidance? For one thing, the questions of how tax rules are written and how the Bitcoin blockchain works are two separate issues. 
The argument is NOT about interpreting tax regulations; it's about determining receipt of funds that were sent over the blockchain distributed public ledger, which obviously would have an impact on a taxpayer's ability to conform to any tax regulations. Because as far as the IRS would be concerned in any case, the blockchain is the only standard to go by in accurately determing when funds were received by the taxpayer.
But let's briefly entertain you're comical notion here of the article's author possibly making an attempt at "intentionally obscuring" ANY of this literally. So who would you care to suggest the author is trying to "fool" in this case? Would that be you, or other people here on Reddit? Do you think anyone is actually out there trying to "fool" the general public who mostly don't care about any of this crypto tax stuff anyway? 
Or do you think anyone would actually be dumb enough to go to these kind of lengths at trying to maybe "fool" the IRS itself something like 2 or 3 years in advance of any possible tax audit that may never happen anyway? In the first place, just so you are aware, the majority of any tax audits even likely to happen in the case of cryptocurrencies will overwhelmingly involve customers of KYC exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, Bittrex and so forth; and any audits are highly unlikely to incude "PAPER WALLET" users.
 Just think about it real hard for a couple minutes or more. I have faith that you are smart enough to realize the IRS does not have anywhere close to the resourses needed to be going around searching for crypto users who use paper wallets, Ledger wallets and even Android phone wallets. I'm telling you that's not something that would even remotely be possible to pull off.
So go ahead and think about that for a couple hours or so. Maybe even go to sleep on it and in the morning when you wake up, I believe you will begin to see the light. 
Also, please remember that people like you, including other Reddit users, are definitely not so important that anyone has the desire of "intentionally obscuring" anything as far as you would ever be concerned. That would just never be the case here.

Oh that! Yeah, but gold is only as good as the consensus of people who believe it's good, because otherwise it's just a rock at the end of the day.
You could back the U.S. Dollar with Bitcoin, providing there was a broad enough consensus to support it, and the effect would obviously be no different from gold. In contrast, the Aztec Indians used "cocoa beans" as money, but NOT gold, because that was their consensus.
The U.S. Dollar actually continues to enjoy tremendous consensus value all over the world, at least from an institutional perspective, when you consider that it is used as the world's "reserve" currency and has been for generations. But I wish they would back the Dollar with Bitcoin, because I would probably become an overnight multi-billionaire even though I only have 30 of them...��

According to what I'm seeing here in the name header of your post, you signed up for Reddit LESS THAN one day ago!! That strikes me as being very unique, and even unlikely, that a person - such as yourself - would have suddenly created a Reddit account only to find himself instantly embroiled in this particular conversation. 
So my first guess is that YOU and the so-called 
r/properauthority user in question here are most likely the SAME person. And the Reddit platform itself can figure out if that's true assuming you signed up for this account from the same IP address. 
Did you know that creating multiple Reddit accounts is strictly forbidden under the Reddit community guidelines? Should they find out this is the case, then they will BAN your IP address and remove both accounts!

WOW, well for all your alleged education, you just don't seem to get it... So let me rephrase:
Back in 1980, the Zimbabwe Dollar was nearly equal in value to the U.S. Dollar. So anything you could buy with $1.00 Zimbabwe money you could also buy with $1.00 United States money. Back in 1980, for instance, an ounce of gold cost about the same for both currencies. 
However, NOW an ounce of gold with Zimbabwe dollars costs literally TRILLIONS &amp; TRILLIONS of those dollars. The same is obviously true of Bitcoin if you tried to buy a Bitcoin with Zimbabwe money. 
If the U.S. Dollar ever goes to complete shit like the Zimbabwe Dollar has done, then a single Bitcoin WILL COST literally hundreds &amp; hundreds of TRILLIONS in U.S. Dollars. And that assumes Bitcoin would even survive if the U.S. Dollar completely fails. I doubt it would survive. In a case like that, gold is far more likely to survive than Bitcoin IMO.
Anyway, if you don't understand the point now, then you never will understand it. Have a nice day...��

I dunno. This last guy I was hotly engaged with here for the past tens-of-thousands of words (I think the same one you alluded to here in your opening quote) definitely wouldn't agree with you about -- "transaction dates that are exactly what one would expect to see." 
He sure didn't think that what is seen (i.e., in the Medium article's transaction screenshots) is what is being alleged to have actually happened where funds from either - or both - the BCH &amp; BTG hard forks were actually deposited to the private keys of those respectively separate Bitcoin paper wallets on the dates shown. His sole argument to the contrary was that it amounted to an anomaly and technical glitch of sorts in the chosen blockchain explorer site, therein being the BITINFOCHARTS.COM platform in that case.
The unwavering argument coming from him is that it wouldn't have been remotely possible for those paper wallets to have been credited with BCH &amp; BTG funds long prior to the commonly accepted dates of August 1, 2017 &amp; October 24, 2017, respectively, for when the hard forks are broadly claimed to have taken place. Even the INVESTOPEDIA.COM website shows a date of October 24, 2017, for the BTG occurrence particularly, which is denoted through a seemingly belated article published on June 25, 2019. So I'll just suggest that you might also want to kickstart a conversation with him if possibly that interests you. 
The one peculiar point that hasn't really come up here in this thread anyway is with the other allegation (proposed by the author of the Medium article) suggesting the resulting hard-forked funds for both BCH &amp; BTG were likewise deposited to all affected Bitcoin paper wallets held by her at the exact same date &amp; time, which is said to have occurred on July 16, 2017 at 21:38:37 (UDT). Now just off hand, is something like that also what you personally would EXPECT to see happen?
It's apparently NOT what the article author would have ever expected to see happen (and me neither), since it effectively demonstrates where both the BCH &amp; BTG hard forks reasonably must NOT have occurred independently of each other, and in fact where they occurred simultaneously. Granted that ideal wouldn't seem to make any sense for any number of reasons that might be argued, but the argument for it happening like that anyway is in view of a preponderance for hard, material evidence existing through not only the Bitcoin blockchain transaction ledger, but also existing through those transaction ledgers for both BCH &amp; BTG, respectively. So I would personally argue that we're not talking about anything like "circumstantial evidence" here to support the author's argument, and indeed where the evidence is hard and tangible.
Assuming the evidence to support the argument is in fact hard and tangible, then it may be said that any prior evidence to the contrary, such as with evidence purported by way of Google Search results, as well as any historical trading charts &amp; graphs having been published at any time, and also to include such purported documentation published through the aforementioned INVESTOPEDIA.COM website, exist and amount to what would more accurately be referred to as "prima facie" evidence.
Anyway, it's really thanks to all this uproarious commotion taking place RIGHT HERE in this thread, that I have communicated in private with Medium article's author, given as Jim Bone, to advise her to look at the situation a LOT more thoroughly. As such, it is according to her where she lost valuable sleep last night again dredging up all her dozens of old Bitcoin paper wallets in the interest of making a much more comprehensive forensic analysis of them.
According to Jim Bone, what she alleges to be true is that, following subsequent input of ALL associated Bitcoin public addresses into both the respectively separate blockchain explorer platforms known to be dedicated solely to the BCH &amp; BTG crypto platforms, what she found is that there is in fact no deviation from the same evidence thusly demonstrated by way of the BITINFOCHARTS.COM platform. In short, all three samples are said to be 100% agreeable in terms of the results produced.
Interestingly enough, it is according to her where one aspect of documentation she had originally failed to take particular note of at any time prior to her publishing of the known Medium article in this case, is with regard to dates shown for when she actually (got around to) "sweeping" the BTG funds clean from the associated paper wallets. In this case, it's worthwhile to note that, although the date for when such wallets were originally credited with the equivalent 1:1 ratio of BTG funds all show the same date &amp; time (as noted above), the date span for when she actually swept those wallets took place over the course of more than a week.
In offering to explain one such example to me for a single paper wallet, what she noted is that the "sweep date" took place on August 17, 2017, or one day shy of a full month from when the wallet was originally credited with the funds on July 16, 2017. So obviously, she allowed the funds to remain on the paper wallets for a full month after they were first credited.
Now at first glance, nothing really seems to be amiss here. In fact, it can be chalked up in simple terms as amounting to one of the more obvious things that people sometimes just tend to overlook. HOWEVER, what it amounts to here is that, apart from the wallets being credited with the BTG funds more than three (3) full months prior to the alleged date of the hard fork taking place on October 24, 2017, what she is furthermore alleging here is that she had likewise depleted those wallets (or "swept" them) still more than two (2) full months prior to the alleged hard-fork date.
So I asked her if she was "sure about that," and she assured me that she had double-checked everything and that it was indeed correct. She also indicated to have followed through with taking upwards of 300 separate screenshots of all the transactions showing on all three separate blockchain explorer websites in the interest of demonstrating where there really is no contrasting elements between any transaction dates &amp; times showing in all the samples, including to show no differentiation regarding the expected outcome for any of the transactions.
So what do make of any of THAT at this point? Is this also something you "would expect to see" happen?
In conclusion here, and when it comes to the question of "pre-fork transactions," I do now see where there is some consideration made for that ideal or nomenclature. However, it nonetheless certainly strikes me as being a completely moot point regarding this particular situation involving Ms. Jim Bone's paper wallets.
An INVESTOPEDIA.COM article on the subject of so-called "soft forks" makes some discussion for suggested pre-fork transactions where it involves the implementation of new and upgraded functionalities to an existing blockchain that are backwards compatible. It also offers discussion for a reliance on cooperation between separate mining factions in view of such soft forks taking place.
But for one thing, these sorts of barriers to entry didn't apply to either of the BCH or BTG hard forks in any case. Such considerations may exist now, or may have existed after the fact of those hard forks, but even then we'd still be talking about soft forks, not hard forks.
The other thing is that where it involved the suggested 1:1 allocation of newly created assets, that part was 100% a given functionality of how both the BCH &amp; BTG hard forks were designed to behave. There was no overriding consensus on that outcome, as well as no questions about things like "backward compatibility," and indeed where the ideal of the 1:1 allocation was effectively hard-coded into the hard forks from the outset.
The only question I see here is concerning the alleged dates for when Ms. Jim Bone's Bitcoin paper wallets were credited with the newly formed assets in view of how that relates to apparently conflicting details surrounding the contrasting dates for when those hard forks are said to have occurred.
The other thing is that the only mechanism said to have been available to achieving the 1:1 allocation of funds was the actual live implementation of the hard fork in the first place. Obviously then, the actual date of the hard fork would also correspond directly to the current "BLOCK" that was being mined at the time when the fork took place. And I'm assuming you already know that much.
So with that being said, it is according to a WIKIPEDIA article published on the subject (and also replete with multiple citations) where the alleged "BLOCK" being mined on October 24, 2017, was -- "block height 491407." (Maybe you also knew that much.)
HOWEVER, according to testimony coming from Ms. Jim Bone, she claims that in referencing one of her many paper wallets, the actual block being mined at the time when the paper wallet was credited was conversely showing -- "block height 481849," or in fact 9,558 blocks before the WIKIPEDIA article was ever written.
So what do make of THAT? Is this also something you would -- "expect to see?" 
In the meantime, I had asked her if she was willing to edit her Medium article in the interest of publishing a plethora of her additional evidence (in the form of more screenshots) to demonstrate beyond any reasonable doubt that her position is not only entirely valid, but that it reasonably cannot be disputed at this point. She said that she may consider doing so, but that at this time, she is too busy breastfeeding...

A decent question anyway. However, I don't know that anyone is "pretending" about anything, whether with dubious intentions or not. So in that way, now it appears you're trying to put words into someone's mouth anyway. As for me, I'm not actually alleging any sort of purposeful conspiracy theory.
Back to your question, though: So let's say I wanted to create my own fork on the Bitcoin blockchain, Dogecoin, or whatever. Then let's say I decided that I want to "pre-mine" 100K coins, a million of them, or whatever, to stash away prior to allegedly publicly releasing the code. This ingenious maneuver is broadly known to be commonplace anyway when it comes to hard forks. Every blockchain coming along that does it freely admits to doing so.
So there I am skimming all my coins off the top say 1 to 3 months before an alleged public release date, but I somehow fail to realize that in doing so, I have inadvertantly released the code at least in part. The technical issue I failed to take into account was that by the mere virtue of my pre-mining activities, I had effectively released the code simply because that was the only reason I was ever able to perform any pre-mining activities in the first place.
So in this scenario, the act of performing any mining activity whatsoever would be contingent upon effectively releasing the code to view the blockchain transaction ledger anyway. And in that way, it could be said that the act of mining under any circumstance is again not mutually exclusive of rendering the blockchain code in an active and open status, as in an online status.
The resulting effect may have been that at least certain ultra-cold storage wallets, such as with stand-alone, single-key paper wallets for example, were indeed credited with the forked coins unbeknownst to me. How else could they have been credited?
But you know what? I know quite a bit about blockchain technology, but I don't know everything. So you tell me, is it possible, as far as you know, to pre-mine coins without effectively "powering on" the underlying transaction ledger? It occurs to me the answer would likely be "no," but that's something of a guess on my part.
The problem, though, is that if it's really not possible to mine a forked blockchain without effectively activating the entire system even in a remote status of sorts, then by simple virtue of the new blockchain being inherently designed to release forked coins to every underlying address out there in its downline, would presumably end up explaining why any private keys, such as with keys to paper wallets, were subsequently credited with funds earlier than was perhaps anticipated.
What it boils down to, though, is that if it really did happen the way it's explained through the Medium article, then there's no other way to explain the situation other than to say that the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold blockchains were in an online status months before any public release date was ever mentioned, and regardless of the current mined blocks at the time.
At the end of the day, though, you can swear up and down all you want that it never happened that way, but it either did happen that way or it didn't. And nothing either you or I are apparently able to say here is not going to change what really happened.

It's just that so far anyway, Bitcoin has not ceased to go up exponentially. And you're right about there not being enough liquid money to support $4 million. The other thing you probably know, though, is that there is already not nearly enough liquid money to support current stock market valuations. Warren Buffett's been telling us that all along. So what's the difference?
I'm not saying the whole thing won't be likely to go bust, but all financial markets go bust at some point anyway. Financial markets are designed to go bust. There's never been a case in human history where a financial system didn't eventually collapse.
So the beauty about Bitcoin is that once we finally get some ETFs going on, then combined with derivatives' trading and massive credit swaps like happened with the 2008 housing market collapse, we can not only collapse the U.S. economy on the back of Bitcoin, but we can collapse Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and all of North &amp; South America all in one fell swoop.
Look, let's just wait until Bitcoin gets up to a million or two and then we'll see what happens with the world economy when it crashes down to about $5,000 and all these derivatives' markets and credit swaps have leveraged everything else out on Bitcoin -- including your mortgage payment. Deal???��
@_date: 2019-10-20 22:41:56
I'm saying (for the 2nd or 3rd time now) that you can't show ANY example of a valid Bitcoin public address being input through the blockchain that produced anything except accurate results. That assumes, of course, that any given explorer site is even operational and is sufficiently connected to the actual blockchain. 
Keeping in mind, of course, that it's all one big blockchain and doesn't change between differing explorer websites. So yes, I'm saying there are no examples in history of something like that happening, not one. 
Transaction times, as you should well know, are indelibly tied to the spending from private keys. So producing an invalid state in the date and time stamp on the blockchain would invalidate the state of sequencing for the two events relevant to the cryptographic principle for how the blockchain is designed to function in the first place. In other words, the two events are simply not mutually exclusive, as they must occur simultaneously.
But look, never mind about how you would so easily (and patiently) explain away simple screenshots showing singular IN/OUT date and time stamps for multiple different explorer websites. I was going to ask you to entertain that explanation as a hypothetical situation, but now I'm not. Probably avoiding that ideal will save some otherwise lost time here anyway.
Instead, let's suppose you were shown evidence for the forensic lineage involving dates and times tracking the full path of ALL transactions for a single address - from origin to completion - directly on the blockchain itself. So in this case, we're talking about HASH (txid) sequencing, as well as the Block ID and the encoded UTC Time.
After all, if worse came to worse (which maybe it could), then this type of forensics is really what the "judge" himself (or maybe the FBI as it turns out) would probably be sifting out. So then how would all that affect your outlook here???
@_date: 2019-10-20 20:53:10
Maybe it is wrong. Tell it to the judge. I didn't write it and can't defend it. But there are no instances of Bitcoin blockchain exploration ever being wrong. You can't produce any.
And just how do you propose that it's reasonable it could have been wrong in dozens of separate instances?
The Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold forks initially relied on the legacy Bitcoin blockchain to verify those forked coins. Are you going to suggest the the Bitcoin blockchain is somehow wrong?
There's no reason I can think of to even remotely believe the story is wrong.

That's not how markets work, though, including not with stock markets. But if that general scenario is what were to play out, then you would simply see Bitcoin on its way to ZERO VALUE from here on out. So assuming that is not what is going to happen (or at least not yet), then Bitcoin will end up going beyond its previous high of $20K...
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:32:53
Bitcoin is -- counterCULTure...
@_date: 2019-06-25 00:13:43
A few years??? If Bitcoin takes a "few years" to reach $100K, then apparently it's year-over-year exponential growth cycle that has so far not failed to happen since 2009 will then be history. You may as well be saying that those exponential days are all over for Bitcoin. 
Maybe they are over, but here's the thing: If you don't count the $20K all-time high, then based on the current price as of right this second, Bitcoin has appreciated by 21,704,023% since 2009. That's an average appreciation of roughly 2,170,000% per year for each of the past 10 years that Bitcoin's been around. That number otherwise works out to a roughly 217,000-FOLD increase.
Then taking 217,000 divided by 10 years gives it an average of right at 21,700 fold in appreciation PER YEAR!! So if we assume a factor of a 20-fold increase for its next all-time high in the CURRENT bull market relative to its previous all-time high of $20K set in the previous bull market, that gives us a price of not less than $434,000 per coin. But in theory, actually it COULD go to TEN (10) TIMES that amount, which would be OVER $4.3 million!
So unless Bitcoin is simply finished with making at a bare minimum of 10-fold gains going forward, then it's NEXT all-time high will be NO LESS than $217,000. Don't forget that from January 2017 to December 2017, Bitcoin went from $1,000 to $20,000 for an effective 20-fold increase in 11 months.
But I think it's more likely that Bitcoin will end up with a new peak price of not less than $434K just based on all of its past history. And the ONLY reason that won't happen is if Bitcoin's history is done repeating itself at this point.
You want to know the truth, tho??? I'm predicting a $4 MILLION Bitcoin price at the peak of this current market...��

Ok, good enough. What you've pointed out here is interesting, or at least some of it. I did purposely delete the post just so you know. It seems like I noted an ever-so-slight grammatical error, which just pissed me off to no end. So rather than editing the post, I proceeded to punch my refrigerator with a bare fist (like I often do) and then deleted it in sheer angst. I work as a professional writer, so I can't stand it when I make stupid little writing mistakes (like that one right there). Just an obsessed perfectionist -- you know the deal.
Anyway, yeah, I don't know what "banks" and any data about their account holders would have to do with "whales" in the Bitcoin space, like you appear to have alluded to here. Maybe there's a connection there you were trying to make, either that or I just missed your point altogether. 
It definitely does happen to appear that I personally have a "Bitcoin-friendly" bank. I wasn't actually LOOKING for one when I first started trading; it's just the same bank I've used for the past 15 years. I think I thought every bank welcomed Bitcoin money at the time. Now, of course, I know that ain't hardly true.
Small bank relatively speaking, and family-owned last I knew anyway. It's got I guess about $20 billion in assets, but still a bit small-fry in terms. Nice tellers. They don't seem to get robbed much. 
Anyway, I did approach the bank directly and told them beforehand they could expect to soon see a sudden surge in cash assets moving thru my account that would not be customary for me. I also told them WHY it would be happening, namely being related to Bitcoin. I just wanted to assure them it was all legit. 
There eyes opened up real wide at first when I leveled with them, but then they just reminded me of the free coffee &amp; cookies in the lounge area and gave me a big smile (or was it a smirk?). But I gather they believed me and all. Long story short, though, no issues with my bank. But the cookies taste like shit, although I'd never actually SAY that much to them.
Are you suggesting my bank will sell "data streams" specifically disclosing my crypto trades? Or am I not following you again? No, I'm sure you are as wrong as rain if you suppose that's ever likely to happen. (Are you Dutch by any chance? That's what I'm guessing right now.)
The elitist Bitcoin consortium can't be very big at all. There's only about an estimated 11 million Bitcoins even currently available for circulation if you don't count about 4 million lost coins and the 1 million allegedly belonging to Mr. Satoshi Nakamoto, which may also be lost. I don't have an "algorithm" figured out just yet to sort thru those numbers, but generally speaking, the bulk of the coins are likely being held by fewer than 20 people. Do you disagree?
Beginning in mid-December 2016 thru December 24th of 2017 (Christmas Eve), I turned slightly LESS than $5K worth of altcoins into eighty-three (83) total Bitcoins. My aggregate cost per coin was therefore right at -- $60!
You've been reading the wrong FUD articles about the dangers of altcoins. That's all I know from past history anyway. Maybe this time things will change. Let's watch together and find out, shall we?!
Finally, though, YES YOU DO kill the goose that laid the golden eggs about the time it becomes infertile and stops laying those eggs. You kill it the same way you kill the cash cow that stops producing enough milk. You don't just keep throwing money away by feeding it grain if it's not  profitable. That's a waste of money.
Bottom line is, the money supply will dry up. It happens EVERY TIME!!

Oh sure, that makes sense. Like if someone gives you a baseball card in 2020 that is only worth say $0.01 cent, so basically it's worthless. But then in 2030, the same baseball card becomes worth $10,000 or whatever. So if you end up selling it at $10,000 in 2030 then you owe capital gains tax at that time. But as far as any forked coins goes, I only wish I could have "gifted" with a bunch of zero-value coins that later became worth millions of dollars. Wouldn't that be nice?! Pipe dream, right?!! (lol)

Maybe you're right... Or at least maybe the initial VC guys will make a nice haul on their investment; then if the end result is anything like the 1990s DOTCOM boom &amp; bust where better than 99% of all those startups failed, it'll be everyone else down the line getting burned, like maybe with users of the wallet for instance. 
I guess the original question I'm responding to here was a good one: How do they monetize anything? 
Maybe they don't directly do that in any case, if the idea is to just have an excuse to keep tinkering with the the LN and end up with a little operating money here &amp; there enough to keep the technology moving along. Even $8 million after all is to many of these ultra-wealthy VCs like $50 is to the average person. If it pays off it pays off. If not then not a big deal deal in the scheme of things. In the meantime, I guess it's giving jobs to a few people anyway.
I did just recently look at the website. Frankly, I had never even heard of the whole thing before. Yeah, and not a whole lot to the proposal there it seems. There's a merchant API, the user wallet, and that's about it.
I do know a fair amount about the LN itself, but it's not something I would ever use. I've never actually paid for anything using cryptocurrency anyway, and I've be a speculator in it for quite awhile now. If I was even going to use crypto to buy anything, though, it would be Dogecoin.
DOGE already has far more real-world use cases than all other cryptos combined. You can buy a house with DOGE without the need for any LN; and transaction times are at least 10x faster than on the Bitcoin blockchain. It's also safer to use than the LN, with really no chance of indiscriminately seeing your funds lost like with losing Bitcoin on the LN. There's no need for 3rd-party "watchtowers" and all of that using DOGE straight out of the box like there is with the LN for Bitcoin.
People will often naively associate DOGE as a "joke coin" because of the dog meme. But all that is inconsequential at the end of the day as long as it serves its purpose well for being a useful &amp; transparent medium of exchange. A lot of people would associate the image of Trump on a U.S. fiat note to also be a real joke, but the money itself would still spend no better or worse.
DOGE is also really engineered as more of an everyday, longterm &amp; viable means of exchange due simply to its built-in ongoing inflation compared to Bitcoin with essentially no inflation. I know Bitcoin is touted as a deflationary model, but the only thing worse than inflation is deflation. You can't actually have deflation for very long anyway in an economy where the idea is to "expand" the economy to meet the needs of a growing consumer base. People just run out of available money. That's why gold stopped working, because there just isn't enough gold to go around.
At the same time, though, even DOGE is faced with the same longer-term scalability problems that have plagued Bitcoin. That being where even a 1-minute transaction time is miserably slow given to any notion of broad adoption &amp; usage on a worldwide scale. So even DOGE wouldn't work for the masses the same as Bitcoin really can't work. 
For one thing, the more miners that come on board, whether with Bitcoin or Dogecoin, then the more clogged the ecosystem becomes. It really is the massive mining hashrate out there that bogs down the Bitcoin blockchain more &amp; more every day. I'm assuming you know that much. It might work to better "secure the network," so to speak, by having greater mining capacity, but it's also the the demise of the whole thing...

I'm talking about HYPERINFLATION? Have you ever heard of that? The reason Zimbabwe is printing these extremely large notes is because of HYPERINFLATION! 
Back during the last crash of the Zimbabwean Dollar, they had printed a $100 TRILLION note; and inflation then was estimated at SIX (6) QUADRILLION PERCENT annually adjusted. In June 2019, the official Zimbabwean inflation rate was 97.9%, but anything over 25% is considered HYPERINFLATION! 
During the final days of World War II, as Germany was losing the war, the German Mark hit 200 MILLION PERCENT inflation. Back then in Germany, literally a wheelbarrow full of cash was not enough to buy a loaf of bread. 
So by the same token, Bitcoin can go to $5 billion, but if the U.S. Dollar collapses in a heap of HYPERINFLATION, then Bitcoin is effectively worthless anyway...

All good points!!! Sounds to me like you must live in Luxembourg. If so, then you are indeed among the fortunate ones. I live in the gold ol' USofA, where we are told &amp; brainwashed into believing that we have all these various inalienable rights, but personally I'm none too sure about that claim to fame for freedom in America.
Otherwise, I personally consider holding 30 Bitcoins to be a -- "symbolic amount." Now if I held 300 right now, then I would consider that more than just symbolic.
I've been a speculative trader, though, and still am one, including not knowing the first thing about "mining" Bitcoin. I've burned thru about 150 Bitcoins to date since late 2015 with currently only the 30 remaining. But if my personal theories about how this market will flesh out are correct, then I'll end up with about another 150 before the end game comes that I'm predicting will come.
By the way, though, when you think about it briefly, it's the "speculators" who invariably succeed in running these things into the ground. They did it in the Long Depression of 1873 when they overspeculated on U.S. railroads; they did it in the 1929 Great Depression when they overspeculated on securities; they did it in the 2008 Great Recession when they overspeculated on the U.S. housing market; they did it in the collapse of the 1990s DOTCOM bubble; and, of course, they did it in the "tulip craze" of the 16th century.
So I expect to see speculative trading run Bitcoin into the ground. I  personally don't know how it can fail to end up any differently than that. And I'm one of them who is speculating, albeit actually to only a very moderate degree compared to the true "whales" in this game...������

It wasn't supposed to last long. It's the weekend for one thing, assuming you know the curse of the weekends particularly during the 2017 bull run. Prices have largely been very flat, as you know, for about a year now, despite the bear market and otherwise steady downward price movement. The significant upturn in prices we witnessed beginning a couple days ago, and now this significant downturn, is welcomed as the first signs of volatility returning to the market. The next upturn before the end of the coming week will bring the Bitcoin price beyond the $4,200 range, then there will be another downturn. Volatility is necessary for longer term upward price momentum and is a sign of a healthy market, including with stock markets. People often think volatility is a bad thing. They are wrong...

Bitcoin.com is owned by Roger Ver, the creator of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Yes, he works tirelessly to promote his "brand of Bitcoin," calling it "the real deal," or whatever. But I wouldn't call this "fraud" in any case. 
All you have to do is READ the associated symbols for the respective coins, i.e. BCH vs. BTC, to know which is which. The original Bitcoin has ALWAYS been associated with "BTC" as its corresponding symbol, regardless of calling it "Bitcoin Core" or any other nomenclature. Conversely, Bitcoin Cash has been associated with "BCH" as its corresponding symbol.
If you can't simply distinguish "BTC" as relating to the original Bitcoin currency, then you need to just send me whatever coins you do have and let me worry about it. Thank you...��

You haven't said anything here... How is "bcash" anymore or any less of a scam than Bitcoin itself? All it amounts to is a clone of the original Bitcoin blockchain, and one of many that are out there. And it is the most successful clone, with BSV taking 3rd place, and arguably Bitcoin Gold taking 4th place. 
At the end of the day, there are no real fundamental or intrinsic differences between any of those secondary hard-forked coins comparative to Bitcoin. Each of them makes a claim to fame based on fanciful arguments like differences in hashing algorithms and so forth, but all that amounts to is arguing semantics for the sake of arguing semantics.
So why is "bcash" a scam and Bitcoin is not a scam? And if you think that it's a scam now, then I guess you're REALLY going to think so about the time its value comes to within a 3-to-1 ratio under Bitcoin itself. Then you'll be wondering why you didn't believe in the value of the scam. No???��
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:33:27
You evidently don't understand how this market works. The full sum of market liquidity is indelibly tied to Bitcoin, which is why when you see Bitcoin either rise or fall in price, the broader market of altcoins tends to follow its behavior in tandem. So the entirety of the market structure is rigged, but likely no more so than with the DOW or S&amp;P 500 being equally rigged.
At last glance, still only 1.5% of all Bitcoin transactions are attributable to trade in commerce; the other 98.5% is attributable to speculative trading. By comparison, back during the Golden Age of "tulip bulb trading," likely very few people actually germinated their bulbs and grew then into flowers, because most of that accounted for purely speculative trading of the bulbs themselves. So really that analogy fits here in the case of Bitcoin, since few people actually "spend" it on anything. 
So whereas there really is virtually no commerce trade being conducted with Bitcoin, the next consideration to make is to ask how the rest of all these various coins stack up comparatively. In fact, easily the one coin to show the greatest involvement in actual commercial trading activities is with Dogecoin. That's been known for a long time now.
As for the bulk of the remaining altcoin assets, they definitely derive their presumed value directly from Bitcoin. So what this means is that Litecoin, for instance, would have no value except for Bitcoin; and the same is really true of Bitcoin Cash.
Here's the part your missing: Bitcoin Cash is deeply entrenched into this whole entire house of cards, as clearly evidenced by the fact that it's traded on Coinbase. And the very first time you were to ever see the value of a coin listed on Coinbase going to absolute zero, then THAT will be a precursor to a market crash the likes of which Bitcoin has never seen. I promise you it will.
So if you do end up getting your wish that Bitcoin Cash ends up at absolute zero value, then mark my words the rest of the market, including Bitcoin itself, will invariably follow at least to the extent of a monumental collapse in prices that thus far has never been seen before...
@_date: 2019-02-25 07:07:18
Implying that it's going straight to ZERO from here... Yeah, that's kind of what I thought you were implying, actually. 
Never mind all the numerous (nearly uncountable at this point) resources, infrastructure and logistics that have gone into developing the "Bitcoin brand" if you can call it that. Never mind that the Coinme Company, the primary producer of Bitcoin ATM machines, is steadily increasing its share of the ATM market. 
Most currently, Bitcoin ATMs worldwide account for $70 million per month in Bitcoin sales, which seems like a fair amount at least to me. This isn't to mention that Coinme recently partnered with the Coinstar Company to sell Bitcoin directly thru is "change" machines, for which the test market is now in full swing in the State of Washington; and Coinstar has over 20,000 of those machines. 
Never mind that the new-fangled Samsung Galaxy S10 offers built in support for Bitcoin wallet developer protocols, or that many millions of people use Samsung phones. Of course, that doesn't mean every Samsung customer is going to rush out and buy the S10 model for the sake of a Bitcoin wallet, but you know where I'm going with this. 
I understand, perfectly, that you personally don't own any Bitcoin; that you perceive yourself to have "missed the boat" entirely in the case of Bitcoin; and furthermore that you're too proud to consider the likelihood of being utterly mistaken with your bias. So at the end of the day, it makes you feel better - and helps you sleep better at night - to just imagine that the whole thing is going away so you don't have to keep fretting about it and can go about your business trolling elsewhere. 
But given to the overall panorama of Bitcoin where it stands right now, it's far more likely - and far more reasonable to suspect - that its ride isn't even nearly over at this point. Barring the eruption of the Yellowstone caldera, or some other such massive calamity, its price will most likely move into the high seven figures in U.S. Dollar terms. And when it does, then you'll REALLY KNOW that you missed the boat...��
@_date: 2019-06-20 15:49:24
That's right: No Coinbase coin has gone to zero -- YET! I guess I did say that, in the sense of saying that WHEN it does happen, it will be a precursor to the ultimate demise of Bitcoin and everything else. That's what I believe. I gather you don't believe it.
Sure plenty of coins have failed, and more will follow. But Coinbase is arguably a catalyst in this whole equation like no other catalyst out there. If Coinbase ever fails, the fallout is pretty well guaranteed to eclipse that of Mt. GOX and every other exchange failure combined. And if Bitcoin fails badly enough, then it won't be likely to recover anymore than trading tulip bulbs were able to recover once that "store-of-value-scheme" ultimately collapsed some 400 years ago.
But you haven't actually said why you believe Bitcoin Cash is a scam anymore than Bitcoin itself is not a scam (assuming it is a scam for the sake of argument), or anymore than Bitcoin Gold, or Bitcoin SV, or Bitcoin Diamond, or any of the rest of it is, or is not, a scam. Because Roger Ver claims his brand of Bitcoin is somehow superior, is that it? Is that why you say it's a scam, for him to somehow try and make people believe his is the better mousetrap?
I agree Bitcoin Cash is not superior in any way, but conversely where neither is Bitcoin superior. That's all BS marketing hype. Craig Wright says the same thing about Bitcoin SV. But that's how marketing works. Everybody claims there brand is the best brand. 
And Craig Wright is the biggest joke of a phoney-baloney scam artist out there, and not a very good one at that. I guess he recently got busted in a bold-faced lie to lawmakers and may now be facing prison time. 
But if Bitcoin Cash is going to collapse simply due to a million coins being dumped into the market like you're suggesting here, then Bitcoin itself should be no less likely to collapse if the 1 million coins Satoshi Nakamoto (whoever he is) allegedly owns were ever equally dumped, and regardless of whether that actually happens or not, or is even possible. It's just the model you're suggesting as the reason why Bitcoin Cash will collapse in your opinion. So if that's true of Bitcoin Cash, then why wouldn't it also be true of Bitcoin?
Saying that Bitcoin is a "store of value" holds no more significance than to say gold is a store of value. I guess it is a store of value, or that it can be, but the determination there is based on a consensus view. If the consensus is broad enough to support either gold, or Bitcoin, as a store of value (which has been true of gold for centuries anyway), then it will be treated as such; but if that consensus fails then gold, as well as Bitcoin, will fail in that role. The same is - or would be - true of Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, or any of the rest of it.
Gold is no more than a rare rock while Bitcoin is no more than a rare piece of computer code. Rarity in and of itself doesn't automatically imply value unless there's a consensus to support that ideology.
The Aztec Indians held a broad consensus that "cocoa beans" were valuable and used them as money. The Spaniards didn't agree with the Aztec's consensus, since they preferred gold, and dumped shiploads of the beans onto the Mexican shores leaving them to rot. So the Spaniards won that war against the Aztecs, therefore the cocoa beans model of money failed the same as the Confederacy monetary system collapsed when the Confederate Army lost the Civil War. 
Some aboriginal tribes in Africa were known to use "chicken bones" as a form of money, because that was the tribal consensus. The list goes on.
Bitcoin Cash is no different: It has value (or would have value) if enough people agree it does, the same as with Bitcoin. Otherwise, trying to argue intrinsic differences between BTC &amp; BCH is no less the same than to be arguing apples &amp; apples, since really Bitcoin Cash grew out of Bitcoin. The only point I see you making here is one of personal ideology. You're trying to create a consensus in support of Bitcoin and away from Bitcoin cash.
All that said, I also play the Bitcoin game and have made a lot of money doing it. I currently still hold 30 Bitcoins. I think I'll make a lot more money and that I'll also end up with a lot more Bitcoins before the ride is over. But I DO believe the ride will ultimately end. As far as that goes, if the tulip bulb craze ever somehow resurfaced here in modern times, then I expect I'd play that game, too.
But concurrently anyway, I believe Bitcoin will collapse in a heap never to recover. Maybe I'll be wrong about that, but there are numerous things I feel would need to change drastically in the fairly near future in order to prevent such a collapse. And I won't bother going into any detail there other than to say I don't think anything is likely to change.
In fact, I'll even go so far as to say that I think I know the EXACT DAY Bitcoin will be ushered into a monumental collapse, but I won't tell you that day here except to say that it's still a ways off. I'll also say that I don't believe the Coinbase equation will happen to have anything to do with it.
If you like, though, I can message you on the DAY BEFORE my prediction for the collapse. By that time, I will have sold everything...

Gold backing of the Dollar was removed by President Nixon because the deflationary nature of gold no longer worked to support a growing, market-based economy driven by consumerism. The tradeoff is inflation on the currency versus deflation and economic contraction. There simply wasn't enough gold to go around.
With gold, as with Bitcoin, the tendency is always for the majority of the wealth to end up in the hands of the few. You need look no further for support of this argument involving Bitcoin than to look at those respective wallets for the "TOP 100 BITCOIN RICH LIST" documentation.
This inequality in wealth disbursement is even true of inflationary-based fiat monetary systems, except that with the former (deflationary) model, the majority of consumers simply run out of any money at all, while with the latter (inflationary) model, the buying power of the majority is essentially eroded down to more or less nothing over time. Hence you have the wide wealth disparity amongst the population that everyone complains about, but that's just how the game is designed to work.
The only thing worse than inflation is deflation, but you can't have your cake and eat it, too, so to speak. Bitcoin will never replace the role of gold for the same reason that gold was abandoned in the first place: It had outlived its usefulness.
The only truly fair form of trade the world has ever known is also the oldest: BARTER
However, barter is difficult to manage, is not well suited to things like international trade, and most significantly is that barter requires cooperation and mutual respect among participants in order to be viable. And the big problem with that ideal in mind, for the most part anyway, is that humans simply don't get along well enough to make barter work.
So we are stuck with inflationary, fiat-based monetary systems (whether paper or digital) that inevitably collapse at some point only to rise again. Fiat money will never go away...

Excellent commentary here! As I was reading it, I considered the rather fragmented nature of how human emotions tend to play out in this whole crypto venue, and pictured that you probably wouldn't touch on that ideal -- but you did. So you made some overall extraordinary points, my friend.
Kind of where I find myself feeling somewhat disagreeable, however, is with your comment suggesting that -- "We are driven by emotions far more than we like to admit, not unlike other species."
Sure enough, it's on the one hand where few people have the capacity to effectively become humble to themselves in terms of objectively &amp; constructively criticizing (or maybe "critiquing" is a better word) their own emotional output enough to realize that they are not nearly fully in control of that output. Whether we admit to it or not, ALL of us are effectively brainwashed to varying degrees by our different cultures and the unique social stimulus surrounding us that we are subjected to.
I see it in myself all the time: There are aspects of my personality and behavioral characteristics that I frankly don't understand the rationale for in terms, whether generally or specifically, but where neither could I change those aspects if I wanted to -- and in some cases I wouldn't mind changing them. By whatever virtues, good or not so good, these are "truths that I hold to be self-evident" (to borrow a phrase) about my emotional makeup that are immutable, or even seemingly innate in many cases. 
I am (still unlike most, I believe) able to objectively quantify the irrational indifference to wit many of my personality traits, but doing so mostly accomplishes little more than an abstract exercise in thought. It's a curiosity on my own part to wonder about - and to be intrigued to try and understand - "what makes me tick," so to speak. 
But as an avid fan and student of the subject of human psychology in any case, I certainly do believe that my fascination with working to better understand my own emotional makeup stems from my (also innate) "hobby" of being fascinated with human psychology in the first place. I delve into trying to understand the subconscious workings of others around me at least as much as I do concerning myself.
In contrast, you take a person like the long-late Dr. Sigmund Freud, the so-called "father of psychoanalysis," who by many accounts was a true genius with the various theories he posited on the topic of human psychology. At the same time, Dr. Freud was a true "psychotic nut case" based on the (at least) contemporary standards of what it means to be a nut case in the opinions of a lot of people, including myself.
For instance, I don't believe for a second that Freud held even a remote capacity for objectively criticizing himself. He believed he had all the answers and that everyone else was subordinate to him. I fondly look back at the visage of his profound greatness &amp; ambitions as being a deeply troubled and remarkably egotistical person on an emotional level by most accounts.
As a routinely obsessive-compulsive personality, he chain-smoked cigars until the habit gave him lung cancer; he was addicted to cocaine and an alcoholic; and its largely believed he passed by way of doctor-assisted suicide from an intentional morphine overdose brought on by his pain &amp; suffering due to lung cancer.
Amongst the most startling revelations about Freud (at least startling to me) was his theory that ALL MEN want to have sex with their mothers. Evidently, he was sexually attracted to his mum (with no word on whether he ever actually had sex with her), and therefor believed - by mere virtue of his own perversion - that every other man must likewise be attracted to there mums.
So the above example is one of how people in many instances will seek to categorically stereotype the rest of humanity given to their own biased and selfish beliefs &amp; traditions. You just can't do that with human psychology. There are no absolutes in existence quite like that to accurately equate human psychology referring to sexual preference -- and not ANY sexual preference, whether it be straight, gay or otherwise.
Sigmund Freud was very, very wrong in lumping together the sum total of 50% of humanity along with himself to say that all men want to screw their mothers. I know goddamn well that was never true of my relationship with my mum, whom I otherwise dearly loved AS my mother. 
But what this whole portrayal clearly demonstrates here is that the late-great Dr. Freud was just another one among the large majority of people who not only don't have a clue when it comes to recognizing their own emotional output, but who furthermore don't have nearly the intellectual capacity to even be able to remotely analyze it from an objective standpoint.
So in a real roundabout way here, the premise of your aforementioned quoted statement that I disagree with is where you alluded to a rather stereotypical idealism in suggesting that "other species" are as much driven by emotions as are human beings likewise driven by emotions. I flatly don't believe that's even remotely true. And I will maintain that there is NOT another single animal more emotionally deranged &amp; confused than is the human animal by a very long shot.
Nonetheless, though, and back to the subject of Bitcoin: 
When you see that trend line for the graphic depiction of the post here cross over into the region of the upcoming 2020 halving event in just a very few short months from now, even YOU are gonna fall victim to utter shock, dismay and bewilderment when you watch that line ultimately COLLAPSE to the utter very bottom region of the chart into oblivion -- NEVER TO RECOVER!!!
It's gonna happen, bro! I'm tellin' ya right now -- it's GONNA happen...��

Oh, I see. OK, so I currently have 30 of them, but I've had as many as 83 at one time back in 2017. I take it that means I'm in an elite group of less than 1,000,000 people worldwide. 
WOW!! I'm sure I've never held such a distinction in my life for any other reason. But I'm thinking I might be able to end up with as many as 150 more within the next 6 months or so. If so, then I suspect that would maybe put in the "10 Thousand Club" or thereabouts.
We'll see...��

That's just because the old doofus never had the smarts to acquire any Bitcoin. So if he can't prosper from it, then he doesn't want anyone else to either. In any case, apparently the current Administration doesn't agree with him, including the SEC Chairman. So the guy is reasonably alone in his stance on the issue...��

You're right, I'm sorry. Never mind. That's not what I meant that it has anything to do with your nationality. No, that wouldn't happen. You've only been on Reddit for three (3) days, so it looks like the only reason you created your account here was to be a troll. Do you know what a "troll" is? Never mind.

On second thought, there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins anyway, and only 17.7 million have been mined to date. So there would NEVER be 1 million people holding onto as many as 21 coins. I'd be surprised if even 100,000 people have that many, but that's not impossible. Are you sure you didn't mean the "100K Club" or something like that?

Copyrights don't mean squat! They are NOT like registered trademarks or even patents that prevent use of name or logo, or of a methodology, by anyone other than the trademark or patent owner. It is also forbidden to copyright a "title" of anything, such as with a book title. 
A legal copyright can be as simple as enclosing the prescribed document in a self-addressed envelope and mailing it to one's self. The postmark signifies evidence for the date of such copyright claim. This information is never seen or acknowledged by the U.S. Copyright Office. 
If someone republishes a work that you believe infringes on your earlier copyright claim, then the burden of proof is with you to show evidence of the infringement in a court of law if you choose to sue for damages. Otherwise, no one cares what you think.
Of course, you can also register a copyright claim through the U.S. Copyright Office. About 30 years ago the cost of doing so was a $10.00 flat rate. They don't read your manuscript at the Copyright Office and just assume you are the creator of the work you claim to have created unless and until somebody disagrees with the claim. Otherwise the claim gets filed away and forgotten.
A patent of the Bitcoin protocol in terms of the so-called "white paper" would be something totally different. A patent formally alleges you are the creator of the specific process or design feature, including mechanical attributes as the case may be, of something and that you claim legal rights to protecting that process, function or attributes. A patent can be filed for instance on the design of a "better mousetrap," or for methodologies used in the manufacture of drugs. Patents have also been applied to human DNA variants.
So if Mr. Craig Wright had sought a "patent" on the Bitcoin white paper as a methodology or protocol of blockchain technology, then that would be VERY different from claiming a copyright on the "intellectual work" of the white paper itself. In other words, he claims to be the "author" of the intellectual work in terms of the white paper, but NOT that he is seeking a patent on the blockchain methodology itself. 
So it really doesn't mean much of anything. He can claim that he wrote the white paper and that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, but the U.S. Copyright Office is neither going to confirm or deny his claim unless and until someone wants to challenge it on some legal grounds. Until then, though, they don't care.
Patents are also much more difficult to procure and typically cost in the low thousands of dollars just for the filing fees alone, not including if a "patent attorney" is hired in fulfilling the process...

Interesting. I've been involved in the space since  mid-2015 but somehow never came across the term. I did, however, just now Google the term and came up with this December 2017 article linked below. According to the article, owning just ONE full Bitcoin is the prerequisite for membership into the club. (Not sure what you meant by "total float.")
That makes sense. There will only be 21 million Bitcoins, thus not more than 21 million people could ever own a whole one. In reality, though, I guess the term is just a sort of catchphrase at best, since of course not even close to 21 million people could ever own a whole coin...

I'm NOT new around here! And I acquired "83" Bitcoins in 2017 from a $5K investment initially placed into Ethereum in December 2016 when it was trading at $7.50 a coin. Later in 2017, I exchanged the Ethereum for 38-million Dogecoin, 130-thousand Ripple and several million Reddcoin; and then I still had a stake in Bitcoin Cash due to the hard fork, which I later exchanged for another 26-million Dogecoin. 
All in all, I ended up with the 83 Bitcoins after exchanging all those altcoins for it, which worked out to an average aggregate cost of $58.38 apiece at a time when Bitcoin was trading at around $2,400 each. I sold all but 24 remaining Bitcoins and am also currently holding 517 Bitcoin Gold and 750 Ether Classic coins...

Absolutely, I'm sure I would be "shocked." The Count was well known for doing that to his victims when he sucked their blood dry. But seriously, tho, don't you think he would make just a perfect Dracula character with that haunting and steely, downward glare of his? He's also a reasonably handsome man with at least a little bit of movie-star good looks, maybe particularly in his younger days. I can just picture his mouth opening and seeing fangs dropping out from his uppers. Can't you? Be honest now...

Yup, and I believe that $60 billion is the real untold reason for Trump's angst toward really ANY Mexicans, as well as Central &amp; South American peoples both currently living here, and otherwise trying to migrate here, because he wants to stop the vast flow of money out of this country. Much of that money going to Mexico is from Mexicans living and working here who are sending it home to relatives. He can't actually make it illegal to move money out of the country, so the only other option is move the people out of the country who are sending the money...

I don't know, since Ive never used Patreon and have never followed the rhetoric around it, other than to have noted a time or two that it's typically regarded (or has been anyway) as a poplular platform; and so I really don't have a clue about who's more likely to be on the up-and-up in the ethics' department there enough to even remotely comment on any hearsay about who did what or why they did it. Probably neither side is "totally ethical" at the end of the day, though, would be my first guess.
Unfortunately, I'm just a fairly early adopter of Bitcoin who subscribes to this thread and gets automated push notifications sent about the more "trending" subject matter to my phone (like this wonderful piece here) where I can offer to inject my amazing wit. So that's just another way of referring to myself as a "troll." But if the subject matter here isn't troll-worthy anyway, then I guess I don't know what is.
Usually, though, people involved in he-said-she-said situations like what appears to the case here, tend to overwhelmingly have ulterior motives for doing whatever it is they do in masquerading around like it's all for some altruistic cause. And people really do fall for the line. Not saying this gentleman isn't truly passionate in his portrayal of altruisim, but on the chance that all things remain equal with the more typical status quo of bias than to actually be truly objective (i.e., where things may not always be what they seem), then I vote the guy should run for president, or at least run for congress.
It's sure okay that the man is evidently striking out on his own following some tit-for-tat undoing - or whatever it was - in his burnt-bridge relationship with Patreon. But when I see this stuff about him putting up advertising for "Bitcoin donations," then that is what I call downright unappealing. It strikes me as being like if the president were to actually turn to launching his own GoFundMe campaign (and then "tweeting" about it) to the American people asking for donations to build a border wall. That'd be just plain showing a total lack of class, I vaguely suspect you'd agree; and then in drawing a likewise comparison for the case of this man here, particularly considering he is apparently already a person of considerable financial means. 
It's laughable based on anything I can gather very simply from the title of this thread. And it's therefore worth trolling about. And the only reason he might disagree with input coming from trolls such as myself is if he lacks the same ability at self-deprecating humor that our president clearly lacks. Otherwise, he should be able to belch out a good chuckle and blow it off.
Starring role in the next box-office smash hit of Count Dracula reinvented through the eyes of an alleged altruistic Bitcoin aficionado? I'm guessing he wouldn't find the ideal a bit funny, but then again, I might be wrong (just maybe). But he fits that role based on anything I can see from his demeanor showing in his portrait here. I'm telling you he does. And he could make soooooo much money, but of course only providing that he can also -- ACT...
