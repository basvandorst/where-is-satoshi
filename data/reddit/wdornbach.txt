I want my coffee to cost 0.00347
I think it's easier when there is simply one unit and nothing to convert.

I would buy something like this, but only if it were a *real* frisbee.
I hate thin, underweight, and flimsy frisbees, and including a bitcoin logo will not justify me buying a cheap frisbee.

"Ten people buy a loaf of bread on an online e-commerce platform, but three of them have their bread eaten by the delivery guy.  This was allowed in the terms of service of the platform, which all ten of them should have read more carefully.  The three who lost their bread want to get the lost bread out of the delivery guy's stomach by stabbing him with a stainless steel fork.  The other seven are mostly in favor of stabbing him with a plastic fork to kill him, but are unsure of the viability of getting the bread back.

Can't we save it for ?

Do neither. Don't try to 'play the market' in attempts to snatch a profit. HODL.

Well my parents don't know crap about BTC.
I guess my age doesn't matter.  Maybe it's just something people would appreciate knowing? I don't know.

Whoa! A new *random* address!
Still no. ;)

Interested List:  I would absolutely love to participate in anything that will bring Bitcoin to more people world wide, and advertisements are an *amazing* idea.  I'm an avid voice actor, so I'd be willing to do the speaking part in the commercial (if there is one) for free.  I'll donate too, I love this idea.

I said random, didn't I?

We need a revolution equivalent to the way Bitcoin is to fiat in this subreddit, and this is not the way it should be done.

I challenge whoever may be interested to compose a musical piece just with bitcoin's price.

I only remember mining 0.14 BTC, but the account says it's got 2.56 BTC, and the transfer is "In process."
I have an AMD Raedon HD 6850, and I ment to type 200 MH/s (haha)

I honestly have no idea how the 2.5 BTC came into my account, there seems to be no transfer of anything going into it, the only way it couldn've gotten there is by me mining it, or something 50btc did.

Haha, sorry I just wanted to see you guys' reaction if something like this was real.  Thanks for the downvotes though! ;)

Okay, how should I go about my situation then, do nothing?  Report it?
