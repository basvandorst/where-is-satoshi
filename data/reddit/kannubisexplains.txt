Inflation comes from inflating the money supply. Andrew Yang plans on funding the Freedom Dividend with a VAT. 
No money printing involved. 
A Value Added Tax (VAT) works like a national sales tax. Yang proposes a 10% VAT. 
So if you spend $10,000 per month on VAT taxed purchases, it'll cost you $1000, which means you break even. 
If you spend less, you'll be net positive. 
If you spend more, that means you probably hold a lot of capital investments. Those investments will grow faster in an economy that doesn't leave people out. The Freedom Dividend harnesses the network effect and Metcalf's law.

Also, SpaceX is launching Starlink. Worldwide satellite internet. High speed, low latency. It already works with 150 satellites. Elon tweeted through it already. 
There will eventually be 30,000-40,000 satellites. 
Also, you can send bitcoin via a fucking ham radio. So, there's no stopping it.

Help me Elon. You're my only hope to get bitcoin to be multiplanetary.

Also, it should have a Bitcoin address for donations. Amateurs. Pfft.
@_date: 2019-12-14 22:54:44
Ok then what could you do with all this?
@_date: 2019-12-26 19:26:13
So how do you propose to deal with the mass automation of labor?
Self driving cars and trucks will displace millions of jobs. 
AI is to the point that call centers will soon be eliminating millions of jobs there. 
Lawyers and doctors aren't safe either. AI can more easily automate those jobs than plumbers. 
Bain Capital predicts that 25% of jobs will be lost over the next decade. 
This is an extremely serious problem.
@_date: 2019-12-26 18:25:28
Here's a good site with answers to those questions and more. 
Basically it'll be funded with a VAT. For a 10% sales tax, every American gets a tiny slice of the benefits of automation. 
Yang explains it better. Please check out the links. Yang has a deep understanding of the problems Americans are experiencing. 
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:49:52
Like it always should've been. 
Bitcoin plus sidechains backed with bitcoin is all we need.
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:21:14
For every job lost to offshoring, 5 jobs were lost to automation.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:49:07
Where did you get that from? It's not on 
Did you make it up? Are you guessing?

You sicko. Gross.
@_date: 2019-12-26 21:03:52
The wealth will be 4 times. But not the jobs. 
For example, electric vehicles require almost no maintenance. That's less mechanics needed. EVs also require less workers to make. 
Self driving trucks will cause a tremendous net loss of jobs. 
The problem becomes how to distribute the benefits of automation. That's where the Freedom Dividend becomes a great idea. 
Automation makes a universal Freedom Dividend necessary. This country is already experiencing the effects of runaway automation. 
It's described in Andrew Yang's book, The War on Normal People: 
It explains so much.

Unless they adopt the Bitcoin standard.

Is that the vibe you get from him are are you being paranoid? Seriously. 
Have your even watched him speak? Have you read his book? 
Here's links again: His best Interview: 
His book, The War on Normal People: 
I understand your cautious paranoia. You need to just listen to him talk for a while. You can't fake being genuine.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:37:12
There's still time. Jimmy Carter polled at 4% at this same time in his election. Andrew Yang is polling at 5%. It's not wise to dismiss such a good candidate for such a bad reason.

You misunderstand. There's a spectrum of honesty. Assuming all politicians are the same is dumb. 
Yang is the best I've ever seen. He's worth a deep dive.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:22:59
He's in 4th or 5th place nationally and his campaign is the most energetic one. 
Besides, it's too early to dismiss a candidate, especially one who is growing his support so quickly. It's best now to focus on the issues. 
This year he went from 30K Twitter followers to 1.1M. 
Here's his best interview:

Fuck yeah
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:25:49
That was 120 years ago and this industrial revolution will shed jobs 4 times faster than last time. 
It's something to investigate, not dismiss. Look deeper.

Way to ignore his solutions for a stupid reason. Please grow up. This matters.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:00:25
He's not a politician. He's never run for office before. 
He makes very compelling arguments. He's worth looking into honestly.
Please don't be cynical about him. The more you listen to him the more your realize he's worth supporting.

It will be so popular that no administration would dare repeal it.

Why would you ever want to sell Bitcoin? Do you even know what Bitcoin is?
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:48:17
Would you quit your job for $1000/mo? 
Also, the adminstration costs for the Freedom Dividend are much cheaper than means tested programs like social security. 
If there's one thing that government is good at, it's distributing large numbers of checks to large numbers of people. 
And how would this destroy freedom? Money IS freedom. 
The problem, and the reason for the Freedom Dividend, is that jobs are being automated. Self driving cars and trucks will put millions out of work. Fewer and fewer people will be needed to do all of the work. 
We're already competing harder and harder for the jobs left for humans. 
The Freedom Dividend of $1000/mo is necessary. When Elon Musk says so. He says the sooner we do it the better.

"All politicians = bad" is a terrible argument. Somebody's gotta win. Andrew Yang is as genuine as it gets.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:24:18
I'm starting to think this is a bot account. How many times are you going to post the same link on the same thread? 
It would be better to argue the merits, but if you want to reach immature people, that's your choice I guess.

If you actually go to the link you'll learn that Yang is proposing to pay for the Freedom Dividend with a VAT and not deficit spending. 
No new money will be printed. Andrew Yang is the smartest presidential candidate I've ever seen. He's thought this out pretty thoroughly.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:52:58
The Yang gang doesn't need the media for him to win.

A dividend is not an entitlement. It's a dividend to the shareholders of our country.

Not all confidence is delusional. Andrew Yang earned my confidence. He earned it with his book, The War on Normal People: 
He earned my confidence on the December debate stage. 
Listen to his Axelrod interview: 
He will earn your confidence too. He is genuine.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:49:53
Yeah but that stunt got him on the Ellen show. 
@_date: 2019-12-26 17:23:17
You're right. Presidents don't make laws. The Trump tax cuts and Obamacare don't exist I guess. 
How it actually works is that if a popular presidential candidate, like FDR for example, were to win and bring a majority in the house and Senate, the new president becomes the defacto leader of their political party. Then they get their team to enact the law. 
It's a nuance, but an important distinction. 
Let's analyze "makes laws." It's not a legal term. It's a way to obscure the idea. It's better to be more specific. 
So the real question is whether Yang could enact the Freedom Dividend. Who knows? I think he probably could.
