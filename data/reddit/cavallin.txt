Problem is that if you don't want to buy Bitcoin at ATH you'll never buy Bitcoin

What are Bitcoin binaries?
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:15:39
Yea it's insane. 
All the possibilities 
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:19:32
I have no, will check it out though! 
Yeah and even better my town is a small big town(It's a smaller city) and only has one center to it, so if I put it somewhere in the center on the square of the city it should gain massive attention, and also advertisements will be very easy to do
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:15:25
Seems very unlikely that would happend to me
And that calculator is not of very much use to me as I have no idea whatsoever how many people would actually buy from it
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:09:52
Yeah the key will be to trick people into buying from ATM TBH, or offer them to be anonymous, that would bring a lot of darknet Bitcoin to the ATM.
And I am pretty damn sure people would buy Bitcoin, 
But we're a developed country and a lot of people has a bunch of cash and seek to invest so that will be my target 
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:02:32
Yeah for sure, in my country there is literally only 1 so I got a big ass area I can expand to and have monopoly lol
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:58:53
Yeah, 
One ATM costs about 6-15k$ though.
Where do you live?
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:40:11
Yeah I figured I was wrong on that front, I read an article and maybe they only included the top tier or some stuff like that

Still If he just sits on his bitcoins long enough he will make back all he spent and have a lot to go lol
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:52:46
Ah yeah okey
