If you give up and want a pre-built that works on virtualbox...  Stumbled across [this guide]( just a few days ago and it worked.  Surprisingly.  I had tried this a few weeks ago with another guide that didn't work.

People like to use it for anonymity. *cough drugs*
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:16:44
Oh for sure, but 48% might say they understand. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:10:53
I'm still not sure if it is illegal to use one.  Let's assume you are doing it for anonymity and not breaking the law.  Can you use a tumbler?   It seems you are saying yes.  I'd guess it would be legal to use and operate a tumbler.  Similar to usenet indexers, those sites aren't doing anything illegal even if most of their users are.  Same here?

I'm only talking about the waiting in line part.

Currently, you may be right because price seems to be very speculative.  But what if it stabilizes in the future.  If it does, I don't think price will go up/down very much because of people speculating. I think at some point, that will just not happen anymore.  But mining costs still could affect it.  I don't know.  Just thought I'd ask.  Someone much smarter than me may understand this better.
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:34:28
I assumed they would. Why wouldn't they? I've never sent a check internationally.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:48:42
I don't want to operate one.  I want to use one.  I want to have a bitcoin wallet with some money in it that cannot be tied back to me.  Not that I'll do anything illegal, but it's nice to know I have that in case I ever need it. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:32:33
Are you guessing?  Because if we are talking theory, I'd think this would be perfectly legal.  The service, that is.  All the service would be doing is randomizing people's bitcoins.  That doesn't seem like it should be illegal.  There is a case to be made that anonymity is a perfectly reasonable concern.  If someone uses those random bitcoins to purchase something illegal, I don't see why it would make the tumbler service liable.  It should be the person who made the illegal purchase.  They could have statements on their site claiming they are providing this service purely for privacy and NOT to be used for illegal purposes.

Well, it's moronic monday.  I'm not saying this is a smart question or thought process.
I feel like the value is linked inherently because mining costs are the only real tangible costs for bitcoin.  You *need* computers to be running around the world to verify transactions, otherwise bitcoin wouldn't work.  We can calculate the real costs of doing this mining and reward people with bitcoin accordingly to make it worthwhile to do.  If we aren't rewarding them with enough bitcoin, they wouldn't be mining them.  If the cost of mining goes up (equipment prices rise, other factors...?), I'd expect they need more bitcoins as a reward, or they will stop mining.  
Because of this real cost relationship, I'd think in the future, the cost of bitcoin would be more directly related to the costs of mining. I'm probably wrong, but that's my noob thought process.  I'd think mining costs and the total amount of bitcoins available would be the 2 factors in price.

Not sure why you got downvoted.  It's a fair question.  No, I don't think it is.  It isn't difficult or anything to get it charging, you just put it on.  The only thing is, you can't use it unless you are hovering over it.  To me, this isn't a big deal.  At work, I use a cable because I might want to be using it while charging.  At home, wireless charger is great.
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:04:11
In all fairness, the technology is in place to take a picture of your check to deposit.  It's very quick.  I only go to the bank if I need to deposit coins or get coins (laundry).  You can't really say this is a bitcoin benefit when the technology for checks to do the same thing is already in place.  Don't get me wrong, bitcoin is much faster. I don't like to take pictures of both sides enter the amount, and sign. I'd rather scan a qr code. Just sayin you standing in line has more to do with your bank sucking and less to do with the tech not being as advanced as bitcoin.

Maybe it was taken from users only.  That might make these numbers work.  
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:15:53
Thank you.  He is making some strong claims, but isn't giving me much to go on.  Without evidence, I'd wonder why it was illegal.  P2P services aren't illegal because they *can* be used for legit purposes.  I'd expect this to be the same.  I wish someone would see this who knows more about the real legalities and has experience and sources.  
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:22:08
Thanks for the share. Good read.

Drug dealers also use cash.  Should cash be illegal?  
MANY legal services are used for illegal use.  I mentioned indexers, but you choose to ignore that point and instead talk about torrents.  Indexers are not illegal.  Sure, they are used primarily for illegal purposes these days, but they aren't illegal inherently.  Heck, even usenet in general could now be considered the same service (mainly illegal use).  They cannot discuss or promote illegal content, they have to have DMCA takedown processes, etc... but they aren't illegal if they follow those rules.  They literally can "plug their ears and pretend it is all legit".  I have also heard some high percentage numbers for Youtube videos being illegal also.  These services CAN be used for perfectly legit reasons, therefore they are not illegal to host.  They cannot knowingly help with anything illegal, but they can sure turn a blind eye. 
Thank you for trying to give me an answer, but you left me uncertain.  You seem to discourage this, but that doesn't mean it is legal or illegal.  It would obviously be illegal if the site promotes illegal activities, but what if it was setup purely as a privacy service and didn't keep logs, didn't have forums discussing illegal activity, etc.   
Upvote for the conversation either way.

That's exactly when I knew as well.  They could have done better making up someone completely.  "small-town software developer Mark Janus comes forward as the creator of Bitcoin...".

I kept my N4 as a backup.  Good thing I did. I fell into the pool a few weeks ago and my N5 is broken.  I doubt OP had an extra iphone though :/

I hope to wake up to a hard crash down to $200.  As much as I want to buy at sub 500 prices, I'm going to go against my normal instincts and sleep on it.  Good luck to all those who are staying up to watch the show.

Is it illegal to mix your bitcoins for the purpose of pure anonymity?
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:14:59
It may not be his *only* reason.  He seems like a pretty smart, friendly, tech-forward person.  I bet he likes bitcoin regardless of potential personal profits.

So if we wanted to be anonymous, we could buy a burner phone for the SMS verification, but that looks like a camera?

Commenting for later. I'll check it out. Thanks for the heads up!

If mining becomes more efficient, won't the price likely come down? In the early staged, bitcoin price is probably purely speculative, but if it grows in popularity, won't it at some point be more closely correlated to how much it costs to mine?
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:16:23
I'm always surprised at how little I hear about coinbase from this sub.  It is a great site.  I follow their updates - they seem to be growing every minute with new employees or partnerships.  I've never had an issue and they seem to put out clear press releases.  I hope they continue to grow in popularity.  
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:54:13
Was it TWiT.TV?  Wouldn't surprise me.  They are tech related...
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:11:25
Scheme sounds negative.  Tool, for sure. There are many people out there willing to go out of their way to spend bitcoin because they want to show their support.  If I had a business, I'd for sure accept bitcoin and use a service to transfer it directly to USD.  Might as well.  You aren't going to lose customers by accepting bitcoin, but you might gain a few.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:16:18
It should be expected.  Sure, if I owned a business I would try to work hard to respond to everyone, but if I'm looking for a job I would expect to have to follow-up or do more than just send a resume via the normal route.  A quick email with my resume will not likely land me a job and doesn't do anything to set me apart from the many other people who had probably done the same thing.

I would buy one for $10, maybe even $20.  I think the people in this sub who are saying $50-$100 are off.  It's a keychain...   A lot of people in this sub have a lot of money.  Pretty obvious when $5 btc tips are being passed around for random comments.  If you get this going, can you message me?  I really would like to buy one.  Great job with it!
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:17:06
As others have pointed out, it doesn't make much sense to talk in terms of btc when talking about how much something is worth.  Not when btc was at $600 just the other day and $900 today.  Talk in dollars, pay in btc.  Until btc prices stabilize.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:09:24
Thanks!  1 minute in and I gotta say... this guy speaks very well. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:43:50
[Video of him talking about it](  He doesn't just compare this to silver.  He goes on to say "if it became used in x% of this category, then the price would be this, if it also became used in x% of this other category, the price would be this...".  His valuation of $1300 is low and I think he knows it.  It pretty much assumes a low level of adoption (considering all the areas it could be used).  He probably just doesn't want to tell all their investors that this could go super high, which might be good.  Investors throwing tons of money into this would certainly cause a crash at some point because the actual use adoption isn't there yet.  Slow and steady rise as adoption increases is okay with me, personally.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:02:12
I totally understand if it isn't worth your time to charge $20.  That just is what it is.  My comment was more along the lines of what a startup business should charge for something like this - and what I personally would be willing to pay.  I totally understand if you don't want to make this into a mini business and sell it to more people (keep it high margin for hobbyists instead...).  Very cool either way.
