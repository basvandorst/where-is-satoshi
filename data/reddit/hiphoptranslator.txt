Yep, totally. Not the fact that Bitcoin is more or less, useless in a general scheme of things as a currency, and is being used as a security (top kek). But yea, I'm the statist for pointing out flaws.


Chinese government, shady Chinese Corps and Neckbeards control your "real" currency


Buy a double cheese burger today with your bitcoin, or will that 0.000000001 turn into a couple mil if you hold on to it enough?
Meanwhile, your family can starve and you can eat leaves, not to mention use mining power to heat up your home. CAUSE BITCOIN HAS USES OTHER THAN HOARDING, amirite


May I direct you to your several very stable Bitcoin crashes, which only happened cause goberment? No other reasons, just goberment. It's always the goberment. It always is.

This is there is no logic. Bitcoin by itself, as of now, has limited application and will continue to do so. People on here, on /biz/ and a lot more places think of it as a get rich quick scheme. However, all of them don't take a second and say "Why is Bitcoin valuable other than us hoarding it more and more"?
The smart "investors" know what they're doing when they go on and on about how it's gonna change the world and it's gonna hit 100k, because the more suckers that buy a useless (that's right, useless, as all of you hoard it, not spend it, and even if you tried to spend it, you'd still have to use fiat currencies) cryptocurrency, the richer they get.
The dumb ones just dream about being millionaires, not realizing their snake oil is too volatile, too unstable and too useless to have any real value.
FFS, Most of the community itself cannot fucking decide on how to scale bitcoin up. Do you think the rest of community will not sell if something happens that they don't like? Not to mention, if Bitcoin has any real application, will we have these conversations with the man-babies every time there needs to be an upgrade to Bitcoin to scale it up? How will it hit $100k if the man-babies cry around about their libertarian paradise on every fucking upgrade?
In general, you can see the thinking process that most cults go through on this sub, it's uncanny.

I agree with you wholeheartedly.
Regarding commerce accepting bitcoin, as it is volatile and unstable, many drug dealers in the days of the original SR immediately cashed out Bitcoin, as it was not really smart to keep your money in it. When it crashed multiple times, people cashed out in very large amounts, you can see this in the charts. So overall, as a currency for retailers, it's not a great idea. Because there can be no cash reserves, the bitcoin can't sit in the wallet and not to mention, Bitcoin by itself is so divided in its communities that saying it has a future is speculation.

So in 10 years or so, when Bitcoin is 100k, it's because the majority of the customers (see how I say "customers", because Bitcoin is a product you buy with FIAT currency. It can be earned, but let's look at as a mainstream product for the sake of this argument) are using it to buy everyday commodities or it's because bunch of "investors" hoarded the shit out of it?
Great that you used BitPay to pay for your digital products. Most people here don't even spend Bitcoins, BECAUSE IT WILL HIT 100K IN A COUPLE YEARS.

Which brings me to my point, it's a currency used as a security, which makes it extremely volatile and unusable, for its original purpose.

It's not though, Cell phones were used to make calls, not hold till they are more valuable. Not to mention, Cellphone technology advancing was not based on a "community" or decentralization. It was a tech that came up, and different corporations ran with it. Bitcoin was invented as a currency, and it's not being used as it was intended. Early Brick Cellphones were not stored till they could be used to make more valuable calls, so it's not even a comparison. You can apply this to any other "tech".
You seem to be too deep in, so I will let it be. Good luck with it all.

Write the same thing for an actual security (not an unstable "currency") and major banks, who are really jealous of Bitcoin's success will buy it from you for a couple mil.

Right, in terms of it being a security and investment, it's absolutely true regarding the convenience. My point was and has been, it's not being used as a currency and I doubt it ever will. It's not serving the original purpose of it.

Majority of Bitcoin usage is for illicit drugs and services.
