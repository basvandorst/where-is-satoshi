I think I'm gonna go ahead and finally buy some tomorrow. I've only been occasionally checking BTC prices but seeing as last month it was $30 and now its $70 it sounds like a good idea.
Question about bitfloor though: with the cash deposit it says to bring X amount of moneys to a Bank of America branch and fill out a deposit slip to deposit the money into LocalTill's account. How does the money get from there to my Bitfloor account? Is there something on the deposit slip that you write in so that it gets to the Bitfloor account instead of just paying LocalTill?

Am I missing something here or is this guy talking to himself?

You bring up a good point. I rarely use BTC but I have needs of it now for hiring contract killers and importing heroin /sarcasm. A few months back I tried them and the way I was told to get BTC with as little personal info or identification as possible was to buy a Visa card (with CASH), register it with false info online so you can make online purchases, and directly buy BTC to be sent to an e-mail address, but MtGox stopped doing the e-mail address thing. I'm not too fond of all these exchange and bank related ways of depositing money to get BTC.
Does anyone know of any TOR based ways to deposit money straight to BTC? Or at least what is the most anonymous method that anyone could recommend to me?

Can't you just delete the tweet and/or your Twitter account to dissociate such a link? Then the link could only be established if whoever was looking for a link decided to look through Twitter records because I've been told Twitter keeps records like maniacs and are cuddly with handing it over to authority. I've got a Twitter with my full name from several years back and I've used it once for about 5 minutes in 2010, and then just now so that I could get dat sweet 0.002 BTC. And I probably won't ever use it again but I'm hoping that this won't mess up my diabolical plans to buy all the heroin off of the silk road with my bitcoins. /s

There are a lot of websites that give out tiny tiny tiny amounts of BTC pretty much for free. Some just give it to you, some make you watch an ad first, stuff like that. They're small amounts like 0.000000009 BTC according to my transaction log because I've done a few of them. Sometimes they are larger like 0.0001 BTC but usually smaller.
