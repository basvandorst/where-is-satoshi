I just chose one random government agency to illustrate the point.

Technical analysis is witchcraft.

It's comparing apples and oranges. Maybe bitcoin is undervalued and maybe it's not - but what it's worth in relation to some other arbitrary asset is irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-06-09 19:22:37
That it was probably really easy to make money in the stock market 50 years ago. Before all the regulations and super sophisticated investors.
Trading BTC in an unregulated market against a bunch of kids like the OP - wow. This is nice. I hope it lasts.

That's one hell of an expensive greeting card.
@_date: 2014-07-23 08:10:23
Awesome thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:28:08
It makes no difference in the context of what you said. 
Fine you want one company: Apple. Worth over half a trillion dollars. Bitcoin can't be used to buy it, so bitcoin is worthless. Right?
@_date: 2014-07-09 09:58:47
Thanks but for now I want to leave it all in coinbase since I'm a noob and don't want to make some mistake and lose my coins or get hacked or something.
@_date: 2014-07-23 09:01:20
How does that work? Every transaction I have to sign in and get a text to my phone then enter a confirmation number? That's worse than PayPal.
Maybe if I had hundreds of coins in the wallet I'd worry about crazy security, but I don't.
@_date: 2014-07-09 10:01:53
Ya I want to do that eventually - but for now I trust coinbase more than myself. I think they are much different than Mt Gox. They are based in San Francisco and have venture capital funding and programmers from MIT etc. Not some shady fly by night company in Japan with crappy programmers.
@_date: 2014-07-06 12:08:39
I like and own Bitcoin and I hate PayPal.
Somebody please explain to me how I can replace PayPal with Bitcoin. 
Note: the people I'm getting money from or sending money to do not use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-29 18:02:37
I'm also using Cap360 for Coinbase transactions and have had no problems. Not even a phone call. Knock on wood.
@_date: 2014-07-23 09:04:48
My settings are the default. It seems coinbase agrees with me that convenience trumps lockdown security.
@_date: 2014-07-09 11:33:43
Happy Cake Day!
@_date: 2014-07-04 08:50:25
Nice try, Coinbase marketing department.
@_date: 2014-07-06 12:34:24
Right, but very few people use Bitcoin, so you wont be able to complete your transactions. So telling people who hate PayPal to give it up and switch to Bitcoin is a little ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 20:59:41
I buy another $100 on Coinbase anytime I think it's a good time to buy. This is usually when the price has dropped and then I read some good news. 
I don't give a fuck what the price is right now - I'm adding another $100 after reading this.
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:44:28
As somebody who invested six figures in domain names over the last decade: just buy bitcoins. The need for a great domain name (and thus the demand for them) is rapidly declining and will only get worse as the internet moves to mobile apps and platforms instead of individual websites. Ya if you could go back in time to 2008 and register a bunch of bitcoin related domains it'd be nice but short of that, people are just wasting their money.
@_date: 2014-07-02 02:39:20
Can you read other comments and the responses to them before asking duplicate questions? It makes the thread unreadable, so it's a jerk thing to do.
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:07:46
Real answer: you can't until more merchants start accepting it
What is about to tell you: close your PayPal account immediately and refuse to do business with anybody who won't accept Bitcoin. Be sure to tell them loud and proud the reason you are no longer doing business with them and how dumb they are for not accepting Bitcoin. 
What's that, you use PayPal to send your 80 year old grandma money to buy her medication? Too fucking bad grandma. Get with the program. Here I'll even show you how to use Bitcoin and tell you about how it's the future. 
Oh ya and dump Coinbase. Cold storage is the only way to store your coins. Never trust a 3rd party.

Are people seriously willing to pay a 30% premium?
Where can I buy bitcoins to sell to these people? I guess coinbase would close my account if I use them?

Came to post this as well. That would be a decent name for a bar, but not an online ad network. Try again imo - if there is time for that.
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:33:30
That was fast.
Is there some shorthand you can type in to view it? So far the only way seems to be to type currency:BTC which is pretty cumbersome. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 21:00:25
Nope! That was the great part about it. PayPal makes you sign in every time. Even if you were just on their site five minutes ago.

Yet every time I post on here saying I want to keep my coins in coinbase because I'm a noob who doesn't know what he's doing - everybody tells me to put them in cold storage...

I chatted with him about buying the site too. I wish he would have brought that offer to me (plane ticket + repay players) I would have beaten it.
Last he talked to me he wanted quite a lot of money.

Definitely agree with you there. Their fraud protection is also horrible and subject to abuse by scammers. That's the main reason I hate them.
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:41:37
Buying bitcoins for pennies (or getting them free by mining) produced returns astronomically better than buying gold or apple stock at their bottom. Nobody started with nothing or very little buying gold and is today worth tens of millions or more. Few investments in history produced this kind of return. (Just look at Satoshi for instance!) I'm just curious where the folks are now and what they're doing with their new wealth.
@_date: 2014-07-22 04:49:15
WTF? Glad I haven't used my Chase account for my Coinbase purchases I guess. That's bullshit though.

Funny you didn't say whether or not they are right.

So if the bitcoin market cap is less than the value of all the real estate in California, the currency is worthless because it couldn't be used to buy all of that real estate?

I'm sure there is an option to use a different Coinbase account. 
Re: security, you have to talk to Coinbase I guess. I love fewer clicks and not having to sign in.

That's a Thai ladyboy, so this is probably in Thailand. I would guess somebody showed the ladyboy a picture of what they wanted and paid to have it carved up.

Almost all of the sending and receiving I do with PayPal is with people, not businesses. 
I'm not going to inform my mom that if she wants me to send her money for bingo, she needs to accept Bitcoin.
Nor am I going to tell the friend who makes me monthly loan payments with PayPal that I'm not going to accept his money unless he sends me Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-23 08:11:55
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:46:16
That is Coinbase's stated goal, yes. And it's why investors have poured millions of dollars into the company. 
We'll see if they can pull it off. They have off to a great start.
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:47:10
He's asking if you registered the domain yourself or if you bought it from somebody who already owned it.
Hand reg implies you got it for like $9.
@_date: 2014-07-26 03:18:50
Well, hope they don't call it a "bug" after that email. Their employee spelled it out in plain English and even gave a reason why.
It seems this post made them reconsider their policy. Good on you OP.

As long as you report what you're earning to the IRS, there is nothing wrong with doing that.
However I guess the bank might view it as suspicious and suspect drug dealing or something. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:11:00
Because you'll probably be able to buy it cheaper at some point in the future.
I'm not saying BTC is doomed or anything, the price just tends to fluctuate a lot on news etc (though not lately). The probability that todays price is the historical lowpoint is pretty low.
If you want to buy some, wait for a dip and but it then. I'd probably shoot for something $500 or less.
@_date: 2014-11-14 10:48:37
Right now on Coinbase it's 396
I was just asking about the news that caused it to go up a lot this week. I don't know what happened, just saw that it randomly went to 450.
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:21:31
What's it like buying or mining a bunch of bitcoins when they are worth pennies and then being a millionaire in 2014?

'they' is made up of thousands of departments, agencies, budgets and decision makers - governed by countless laws and regulations. 'they' does not have the ability to think and act as one, even if it wanted to.
if the CIA wanted the coins, this may have been their only legal way to obtain them. especially under intense media scrutiny. 
edit: I chose the CIA at random to illustrate the point. Insert any government agency you like and the point stands.

And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why the price was going down on news of this auction. People looking to purposely tank the market price so they could make a few bucks in the process.

Doesn't cost me anything. It's free to send money between friends. Also free to withdraw to my bank account.
I know some things cost money but not sending between friends.

I had the same problem not getting the text message but the phone call worked. Try getting the text message?

Its most convenient because it's what we both have. How else would I easily send money to my mom who lives a couple hundred miles away? Mail her a check?
I guess Coinbase is an option but then she has to link her bank account to it and I have to explain to her WTF Bitcoin even is and get her to trust it and trust Coinbase. etc. etc. That's a lot of friction.
@_date: 2014-08-03 07:08:54
Can't you just move the coins from Coinbase to your private wallet? That extra step is that much of an inconvenience?
@_date: 2014-07-29 18:06:41
Were you doing a high volume of buys and sells? 
I've often thought the way Coinbase does it, debiting and crediting your bank account with each transaction, might raise some red flags. Might be better if they just let you keep a $ balance with them when you sell, like PayPal, instead of automatically sending it back to your bank.
@_date: 2014-07-22 19:34:11
@_date: 2014-07-21 03:35:39
Dude, being a huge asshole in public is not the way to spread Bitcoin. You can't go on private property plastering posters everywhere without permission. For any cause. I can't believe you thought that would be acceptable. You're lucky they didn't call the cops.
The correct way to do this is to not put up a single poster but to first go inside and ask permission to do so. If they tell you no, say thank you and then leave.
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:25:33


And how do you know that exactly?
@_date: 2014-07-13 12:10:49
that it?
@_date: 2014-07-31 22:30:49
This is neither news nor speculation - it's the opinion of someone in the banking industry. An opinion I had not heard before from someone in that position.
I'm "basically saying" that if banks are scared of bitcoin because it poses a systemic risk to their core business, the payment processing he described, then that means there is a (probably really small) chance bitcoin could take down the banking industrial complex. I'll throw a $100 lottery ticket on that.
