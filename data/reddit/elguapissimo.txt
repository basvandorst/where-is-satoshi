Is the Bitcoin project bigger than one man's vision for it though?
This would be like the NASA team, on the eve of the moon landing- with the whole world watching- referring to Kennedy's speech for tips. 
Obviously Satoshi was a very high grade mind, but when he conceived this project, this level of adoption was almost unimaginable. He hasn't commented in years. I have all the respect in the world for his visionary genius, but should his word be treated as canonical?
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:58:38


Exactly. 


So it will become really expensive to send Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:45:11
No, you're right. The bank does, and I lend it to them. But at least it's real money. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 04:01:53
Yes it could. And I'm NOT on a homework assignment. I asked a question. If you don't have an answer, or anything to contribute to the discussion, stay quiet.

I agree it's an elegant setup which looks very scalable on paper, but my point is that when things become grand in scale, there are unimaginable hazards along the way. He didn't draw a roadmap for an attempted BCH coup, for instance... even a master architect can't plan for everything. On the other hand, it's good to have a vision to stick to. Better even than having a spokesperson who can change his mind / become corrupted.

I already went there and left. Bitcoin has all kinds of obstacles to functioning as an every day currency. The greatest one being that its price is too volatile to actually use it. Another that it has already scaled to capacity at a fraction of existing payment networks. I agree that the advantage of owning your own money is great. But only if it's functionally money.
The govt 'ownership' of USD at least puts the weight of the law behind it. Did you ever wonder if we need those powerful institutions to stabilize the perception of value?

Bitcoin isn't failing like an exploded rocket. The sad truth is that the network is functioning as it was designed to. Its efficiency probably won't change unless it recentralizes and synthesizes with existing financial institutions. The institutions don't have a huge incentive to do this at the moment, which is why it hasn't happened yet. 
Bitcoin is way too volatile to function as a store of value or a coffee currency, and mass adoption won't help that volatility. Besides mass adoption requires a level of regulation that bitcoin was designed to be resistant to. 
Bitcoin is working as it should, and designed against change. So not a very good analogy with a failed rocket.

You haven't gotten your initial crypto payment back. You are getting fractions back, the price has just gone up.

Genesis Mining is a SCAM. Promote them if you want but get your facts straight first.
0% of their "investors" see even a break-even ROI. Everyone who gives them money ends up with a small fraction of their initial investment. This is a mathematical FACT.

Yes anarcho capialism is very stupid. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:48:02
It does suggest a ponzi. 
They are only taking crypto payments, and only paying out in crypto, but their operational costs are in fiat. It is much more likely that they are just redirecting the crypto 'investments' they receive than bothering to convert to fiat to pay electricity bills at their 'secret mining locations'.
@_date: 2018-08-15 06:33:16

They make it tricky to copy and paste your returns, so you pretty much have to do it piece by piece but sure, you can do it yourself if you have the time. Just be sitting down when you realize how much they've taken and how much you're never getting back! 
Greasy Marco refuses to say how many Genesis 'investors' get a break-even ROI. Not even how many are profitable. Break even. Wait a minute, isn't that something you'd want to advertise? If your investors are making money, wouldn't you want to tell the world about it? 
NONE of them get their money back. Ask him yourself.

You received back a fraction of your original crypto investment. The price just went up. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:46:01


Do you realise how much more you would have made if you had just kept your bitcoin? You only made 'profit' on the conversion rate. Genesis actually held you back from doing this, because you never got your initial crypto investment back and never will. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:06:47


That's not what we're talking about. Basic point: Whatever you pay in crypto you will never see the full amount of crypto returned. Let alone a profit. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:41:52
So we should regulate bitcoin? I thought bitcoin's virtue was its resistance to regulation?
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:49:35
Interesting. Hopefully there will be a class action one day and Greasy Marco will end up doing favors in a German prison.

@_date: 2018-05-14 06:01:48
No it won't. If the price increases x10 the value has *not* been stored well.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:15:43
Price stabilization HAS to be part of that process. How else will it function as a currency?
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:53:17
You haven't received your initial crypto amount back. The price just went up. You'd have been better off holding it. 
It's likely all they did is hold it for you. Hence a Ponzi.

No you haven't. You didn't make back 8x the ETHs you gave them. You have received a fraction of the ETHs back and the price of ETH has gone up. 
The FACT is that Genesis Mining won't even let you track how much you get back from them. There is nowhere on your account that you can see a total return.

Well the claim itself is untrue because there are plenty of technical things I do understand. 
But help me here: What am I missing? For Tether to function as it should, the issuers must have as much as they've issued, in reserve, at ALL TIMES. This total is up to 2.5 billion. The company doesn't have it. Or if they do, they're not showing it to anybody. 
They are instead printing money they don't have, and spending it on cryptocurrencies so they can inflate the price, dump the coins and make themselves rich off average joes who invest with real money.

Trustless or not, bitcoin is not useful as money if the price remains volatile and susceptible to manipulation. If the price keeps +/- 10% of its value every day, who would ever use it to store their assets in, or pay others for goods?

As for losing the phone, when you set up a wallet you'll get a seed phrase which is basically like a restore password, that you can use to restore the wallet on another device. So just write down the phrase when you first set up the wallet. And keep it somewhere safe. Tell her to do the same.

Ask yourself what has changed since you first decided not to tell her. 
If it's rainy day money, does she need to know while the sun is still shining?
If you suspect things will change for the worst if she finds out, then I would listen to my instincts. The suggestion to sell 25 is a good idea. See how she handles it. 
I'd also be careful because anything big like this can have a big change on a relationship. Big changes aren't always welcome in a marriage. Good luck.

You are the ill informed one. And you're doing a disservice to this community by misrepresenting the facts. 
1) Limits. **There is no limit to the amount of crypto you can deposit**. Even on Tier 1, the very lowest verification Tier: you can deposit as much as you want, into the **millions**, if you choose. But the withdrawl limits tell a very different story. Crypto limit is 20k for the *entire month* and fiat withdrawl limit is 0. Yup, kids. ZERO.
2) Support. I have made many more than the 3-4 support tickets you have.  I have used Kraken for a long time. Their support is not good compared to other exchanges, where you can contact the support team directly and the turnaround time is measured in hours not days. 
And no, my support ticket was not about the lag (which is not actually 'lag' but all-out failure), although the failed order error message literally suggests contacting support if the problem persists. 
I contacted support for another reason, to get their assistance with something actionable. They will not reply for days because their support is understaffed and their network is overwhelmed. 
3) 


This is really the only part that matters. If you stay with a site that won't process your orders when you need to trade them, you are a sucker.
I don't believe I owe any understanding or sympathy for their scaling problems in this professional context. Keep using them if you want to, but you could easily LOSE MONEY 
in failed trades. It has happened to me, so I am warning the community against this experience.

They can't control bitcoin, but they ARE trying to improve it. And people are freaking out and acting hysterical. Things change and improve. Grow up and get over it. 
If you want more influence over the fate of bitcoin, start mining it...!
This "small group" provides more than 80% of the function of bitcoin. They aren't a small group on the blockchain. On the blockchain, they are a sweeping majority. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:29:04
So you think I sold my "ideals?" You've cracked! Do you even know what my ideals are? 
What I did this week is called hedging, to cover risk. I explained my thinking in previous posts. I am not in league with any Chinese cartels. If they had won this ugly contest- which seemed very plausible when I woke up this morning- it would have proven the fragility of decentralization as a concept (which is ALWAYS under threat from Wall St, regulators, and all manner of greasy profiteers). This would effectively spell the end of the crypto dream for many, myself included. 
If the current network were brought to its knees functionally, the exchanges would have swapped the name out to fall in line with the big players and ALL future BTC purchases would be B2X purchase. The futures would have been good coverage on an otherwise bleak day. Since they were 1/6 the price, it was essentially like buying insurance against the event. It's not a difficult concept to understand. 
I don't owe you an explanation, nor for that matter do I owe you any loyalty to bitcoin. Well you have both now anyway. And fyi people who want to sell their kidneys are welcome to. I don't recommend selling both though- except maybe in your case. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:51:22
I think the 88% 'loss' is a bit of an illusion, since the value is relative- the miners will be mining new coins, and they will be able to determine the utility of the both btc and b2x. 
Most of them got into this game early enough when the cost of a bitcoin wasn't much and they worked under the presumption it would be worth more in the future. It's possible they'll play their cards that way again.
If the mining cartel does walk to 2x, it seems like a good time to get into regular ol btc mining.... The network will need me. Right?

@_date: 2017-11-08 00:07:33
It is very presumptuous to assume I don't know the arguments. I'm making the case, since everybody is opposing an improvement to the network without a clear reason. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:09:23
Guess what guys, these miners already have 80% of the network under their control. That won't change either way. Their mining power isn't going anywhere. And they're trying to improve the system. 
So... if you didn't want them to become so powerful, and it's important (spoiler alert: it isn't) you shoulda thought about that when you were supposed to mine and you thought "meh, I'm too lazy I'll just let the Chinese do it." Well, guess what, they're doing it.

Hey crackpot. They didn't catch anybody else. There was only one guy who got caught, one guy who got arrested, and one guy who was tried. 
His defense team blamed it on Karpeles! Is that lol enough for you? So that's what Ross Ulbricht thinks of you, and whoever's grandma sat on the jury. 
I honestly don't care enough about the case to read about it. I like the intelligence agencies in my country, and I don't give a shit about DNMs. They are mostly full of spammers, scammers and nasty drug dealers. None of those people would be my friends. I'm not edgy and I don't want to bring down the system, bruh. The documentary was pretty good. Think it was called silk road something something. The FBI agent basically narrates the whole story of how he caught Naughty Ross. If I shouldn't trust him, why should I trust you? You're just another stranger on the internet.

@_date: 2018-03-27 16:14:21
Of course I don't agree with all government laws, but I still think it's a good idea for societies to *have* laws. Mostly to protect the weak. 
Ulbricht ran a very large and illicit drugs market and ordered people killed. I don't think of him as a hero of anything. 
He deliberately operated so far outside the law, that he violated his social contract and to be honest I don't really care what happens to him. Why should I? I'm not an ideologue.
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:55:00
My position is pretty simple. The rule of Law is good because it protects the most vulnerable members of society. Strictly speaking it protects everybody, even if you are lucky enough to go through life without ever needing its protection.
The Law typically reflects the values of its society: this can be seen in the differences in laws from country to country. Now, representing everybody is always a difficult process, and if you have a fringe view, you might feel like the law doesn't represent you. The law doesn't care because it is an impartial representation of what society at large wants. 
Like you, I live in a society and enjoy its *many* benefits. So I adhere to the consensus set out in the laws. As a bitcoin advocate and man of the people, you are evidently pro-consensus. It's only when the consensus runs counter to your own interest that you suddenly want to throw out the whole system. 
Maybe some drugs need re-evaluating and re-classifying. This is obviously a tricky task, and we do entrust experts (who often devote their whole lives to their expertise) to make those decisions. Over time, when the facts align with the will of the people, the changes do happen. They happen slowly and this is good. Maybe things could become more efficient. Maybe the political class could be less corrupt. But generally I do think they have a tough and ugly job: representing the will of the people and keeping things stable, while also keeping themselves in office to hopefully affect meaningful change. 
The point is that we already have a system. Of course it is imperfect, it is human and humans are flawed. Of course it doesn't represent the totality of your interests. Why would it? It has to represent everybody as fairly as possible. If you don't like the system, you can change it. Abandoning it in favor of an anarchist utopia is not a meaningful option. If you disagree, go to a country where there is presently no rule of law. It still not much easier to run a hard drugs market and much, much harder to get virtually anything else done. Including sending ambulances to the dying. 
Saying "fuck what the community thinks, I do what I want" is always going to (rightly) result in your punishment and probable banishment by that community. This is a law of nature. 
The prison system is far from perfect, but it is telling that the punishment for most serious crimes is to literally remove you from your own society until you are ready to play by the rules again. What the community wants *must* be important to each individual, too. Otherwise society fails.
Like I said, there are laws I don't like. Maybe some drugs really are valuable and medicinal. If that's true, the changes will come. But it is a step too far to abandon the very concept of Law just because you don't like some of them. You enjoy its protection as much as anybody else. Getting rid of all drug laws is also problematic. I would personally say it's because there are many substances which are ripe for abuse and threaten the stability of society. But that's just my personal view. The reason most banned substances are banned is because most people want them that way.

The scaling required to make the Bitcoin network competitive with just Amex alone makes in totally untenable. It can no longer scale up even now, and has stalled at a tiny fraction of the volume Amex does. To say nothing of the electricity output required to sustain the network : an inefficiency *by design*. Decentralized systems appear to me to be inefficient by their nature, compared with centralized ones. 
The price is much too volatile to make it useful to spend. If you think $0.96 is a problem for merchants, ask them how they'd feel if their payment halved in the space of a month. 
The stability that other forms of currency have, and that bitcoin needs to be useful or mass adopted, comes from their being endorsed by institutional authority. Without it, you just have a mass of individual actors who can't agree on the way the system is run, and who are out to exploit the system and the other users as much as they can. This is why we're in the state we're in right now. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:09:25
You don't get to pick and choose the laws you adhere to unless you want to live in a society of 1.
Sort of how in a society with free speech, you might have to be offended sometimes. But you enjoy the privilege of being able to say whatever you want without being oppressed.
Well, in a society with laws, you might have to obey some laws you don't like. But you get to enjoy some great benefits, like the protection of the state from violations. Like your excellent examples of not getting hurt or robbed. You don't get to pick &amp; choose, because it's not just about you. The laws have to cover everybody's needs if they're going to protect everybody. 
Question: Have you ever been to a society that has literally no rule of law? Like a failed state, or an African country engaged in civil war, for instance.

That's exactly what I am! What are you?
1) How does the LN solve the problem of multiple channels trying to use the same route at the same time? 
2) How will it find available routes which are not competed for and which have enough liquidity? With the extra dimension of liquidity added, how does route-finding work? Doesn't the entire rest of the network need to be updated about its new liquidity status every time a new route is found? 
It's my informed yet stupid understanding that these two problems have not been solved. Have they and what solutions have been found / are being worked on?

Steady there. 
It's not the intelligence agency that convicts him, it's the judicial system. If I was a jury member, I would put 2 + 2 together and say "I have no reasonable doubt that Ross did all the things DPR did and not just some of them."
Btw, I watched a documentary about Ross Ulbricht's capture and the agent who busted him went through the whole process of how he caught him. I thought he covered the 'how' pretty extensively. 
They did catch him using the name, and he didn't incriminate anybody else. Why are we meant to think that anyone else was involved?

The point of the blockchain is that it doesn't require trust. There should not be any need for trust. 
When you get to well-known corporations acting as trusted hubs, there is very little difference between that and a centralized banking system. 
Power automatically clusters around wealth, exploiting the weak. It's nature. I agree, corporations might want to be the hubs in the LN, but I wouldn't see much advantage to using it until it is much, much more established and too powerful to fail. To do that, it must synthesize with our existing banking network.  
Here is a list of problems with the LN as outlined by someone more smart and more technical than me. I understand about 2/3rds of them but it's enough to dissuade me from being impressed.
I tried asking about LN on r/bitcoin but was downvoted and criticised. One poster even called me a bcash shill. The rabidly censorial culture and 'us and them' mentality that has fallen on this sub, alongside an honest technical appraisal of the technological utility and the problems it faces in its current stage (which is still developmental) are some of the reasons I am now shorting my position in bitcoin.

LN not currently installable on the pizza guy's phone, though. And the hungry bitcoiner would have had to already opened up a payment channel with the pizza guy or the pizzeria. Which would have cost the same fee and same time as the regular network. So, more like 1 hr, 1.5 seconds.
Pizza still woulda gotten cold. 
By the way don't downvote my comments just because you don't like what I'm saying. I'm contributing to the damn discussion. Downvotes are for spam or personal attacks. This is the BITCOIN subreddit and I am talking about bitcoin. I have been using bitcoin for a long time and I understand it pretty well. 
It is not perfect and it has some design flaws which we are all trying to solve together. 
If you downvoted because you don't like the REALITY of what I'm saying or you're worried about criticism affecting the price then you are the problem.

Lol okay you don't like laws. Well you are welcome to go live in Antarctica where there aren't any. As long as you want to opt into society, you have to adhere to the general principles that the society has codified. 
Laws are a lot like free speech. They're a condition of a civilized society. They're the best we could come up with as a group. You don't have to agree with all of them, or even like them. You might feel like some of them don't apply to you. But you still have to respect them. 
If you don't respect them and get caught and punished by the same society that protects your rights, don't cry about it.

Based on what you're saying, are we to conclude that you are really in favor of Big Pharma and Big Tobacco? These are, after all, the natural results of legal industries built around addictive substances. 
Imagine what a horror show Big Cocaine would be. I'm sure you would love it, but unfortunately for you the society you live in has chosen another path. Hey, maybe if we all contribute a bitcoin to Ross's case, we can Big Murder legalized as well.
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:26:09
Those laws aren't for you. They are to protect vulnerable people, who should not be using addictive substances of any kind. Mentally ill people and children are two categories that come straight to mind, but there are others. 
I assume if you are in a western country then the penalties for private consumption of these substances are very low anyway. I doubt you'd face incarceration unless you are trying to buy and sell them. It is not your right to sell highly addictive substances, and if you feel that strongly about it, move to Antarctica. There is a region there with no laws!
Oh wait, a minute you like living in a society? Then adhere to the consensus.

There are a ton of businesses and services that don't take cash. Amazon doesn't take it. Apple doesn't take it. Google doesn't take it. 
In the information age, businesses want as much information as they can get about their customers. A lot of the time they sell it. A lot of the time their whole business model relies on that data. And this trend is increasing. 
Any company that wants to know about its customers is very unlikely to take this kind of payment and lead a charge against KYC practices. 
Only stupid people believe IQ is a good measure of intelligence. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:02:05


I don't claim to. We have experts in our society who we pay to make those decisions. 


Who is getting locked up for private use of their own medicine? By 'access to medicine', I assume you mean possession of hard drugs. They usually get off with warnings/confiscations/misdemeanors for a personal amount.
In my society (European) we lock up the people engaged in the drugs trade, as a disincentive to engage in it. We do this because we want to limit the supply of addictive and destructive substances into our society. I don't necessarily agree that incarceration is a good idea for everyone, but we generally lock up nasty people who ruin others' lives. 


Not always adults. Not always mentally competent. And they aren't always 'goods'. Sometimes they are pretty bad substances, that have the potential to fuck up the social cohesion or turn them into desperate zombies. This isn't me talking, this is your whole society. We made the decision together, using experts whom we paid with your tax dollars.
You are a member of a society. The society you participate in has collectively made these decisions about these particular substances. Your society doesn't want heroin being sold on every street corner because it wrecks lives. You have to adhere to the consensus if you want to enjoy the benefits of the society you belong to. 
You may disagree with society's view of these substances, but you are in the minority. If your view was the majority (e.g. a lot of people don't really care about the legalization of cannabis), the vaues of your society would reflect that. And the laws ultimately reflect those values.


They're not my edicts. I am not the ideologue. Ross tried to impose his views on a society that didn't want them. And he did a lot more than try to smack someone in the face. Society decided they didn't want Ross around.

It's not a tautology at all. Engaging in illegal sales, and facilitating them as a third party are two totally distinct activities. is saying they should both be illegal. 


Freeing slaves is not a good analogy to helping cartels sell drugs and guns. One is about raising the level of freedom to the same status as yours. A pretty defensible egalitarian goal. 
The other is helping pretty unsavory people make a profit by trading addictive products to literally anyone - even if they aren't old enough or competent enough to consent. Organized crime is responsible for a huge amount of death and misery. Not to mention forced prostitution, kidnap, etc...
Sorry but you gotta start thinking up better analogies.

We have come a long way since then, bruv. I don't know why you think it would protect your rights. Britain doesn't even really have a constitution as such. You are all just subjects of her Maj. Gutted!
I like due process. I like the egalitarian angle. Everybody gets the same treatment. The price you pay for that is that you don't say you're above society or its laws. Not a difficult concept to grasp.
You can call yourself an individualist but you still avail yourself of all kinds of protections and advantages in the society that were just handed to you from birth. And you took them like they were your birthright. Why does the ambulance come to your house when you have a heart attack from doing all your home-cooked meth?

Of course you can't stop people using transactions or the blockchain, but you can still make them irrelevant to the legal economy. I've heard of banks freezing accounts for bitcoin-based businesses. Their money is gone now. 
Current price of btc reflect investors speculating about mainstream adoption, and this could be wiped out. If a govt outlawed bitcoin and made frozen accounts the status quo, the potential for mainstream adoption would vanish. 
Andreas is aware of this and counsels against putting your life savings into bitcoin for this very reason. 
Nothing wrong with my brains or beauty, you rude little man.
