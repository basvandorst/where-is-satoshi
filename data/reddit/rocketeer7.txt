Lol this is not going to end well. No asset can appreciate this fast and then hold over the short term. Too many people will try to sell at the same time. A rush for the exits as it's known.

They think they know better. Everybody thinks they know better. That's why democracy exists.

Look at Nancy Pelosi's speeches right around the Snowden timeframe. She came out condemning the NSA and then STFU real fast. Literally a 180.

The one flaw... explains why we went to Republic. But now look at it.

You know I love saying I told you so, but this is one time I don't. The Conspiracy subreddit has been reading like a news website for the past several years. In fact the conspiracy subreddit is probably the most reliable source of news right now. The CIA can do this shit to the heads of media companies too.

This has already happened bro.

I don't think it can become THE global currency because of this problem. I still think it can be a valuable asset class for transferring or preserving wealth like gold is today. If everybody agrees it's worth something then it's worth something - just like gold or any other currency.

You'll need more than one econ course. I have a Masters in Econ. and I couldn't think of a worse idea than a fixed amount of currency.
@_date: 2016-07-09 21:22:40
Yes that is still preferable to a fixed amount of currency forever.

So did slavery.

The economy has been shown to grow much faster overall, with lower average unemployment rates, under a very gradual inflationary monetary policy (1-3%).
This means that resources are allocated much more efficiently under this approach, at the cost of savers having to put forth a small bit of effort to counter the effects of inflation.

This is a well studied area of econ due to the gold standard having been around for so long (I recognize the gold standard isn't exactly a fixed money supply, it actually grows over time from mining), so I'll copy paste the below info. Also keep in mind that the gold standard was an absolute mess when it was in place:
A moderate degree of currency inflation serves a number of useful functions in the economy. The most obvious are:
It induces people to spend their money before it loses its value. In a deflationary environment there is an incentive to put money under your mattress and spend it in a year when it has greater purchasing power. If everbody does this then the lack of demand will lead to a decrease in overall economic activity (i.e. a recession / depression).
It provides a weapon against downward nominal rigidities. For example, workers are generally reluctant to accept a nominal pay cut, even if market conditions are such that the current wage is above the equilibrium level. Inflation means that their employer can simply increase wages at less than the inflation rate so that the real wage is decreasing.
It erodes the real value of nominally denominated debt. Now, this is obviously only a pseudo-advantage because (whilst it benefits debtors) it harms creditors. However, this kind of erosion of debt may be desirable if national economic stability is threatened by high debt levels (see 2008 housing crisis). Also, since debtors are usually poorer on average than creditors, it can reduce inequality, which may be a normative objective for the government.
Without inflation you miss out on these benefits. The first benefit might not seem like a big deal if you think you can simply set the rate of inflation at zero percent. But it is very hard to hold inflation constant at some target level so attempting to hit zero inflation will almost certainly result in occasional lapses into deflation, with the attendant negative economic consequences - this happened many times under the gold standard.
So what is the answer then? Making sure everybody gets some base level of financial and economic training before they start to make money so that they can be responsible with it.
