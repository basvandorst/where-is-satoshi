Hi op, I know you're prob flooded w messages but ty for sharing your story. I was in a similar situation and contemplated suicide many years ago when I nearly ruined my BTC holdings but slowly made my money back by facing forward and not beating myself up about it because I was still young. I could easily see someone much older than me never recovering emotionally from such a big loss.
I would like to know two things : did you brother have a history of depression prior to bitcoin and was your brother's current financial situation really bad?

To be fair, if you 'forgot' about 1.4k in 1997 until 2019  you prob are in good financial shape and don't need it

First rule about bitcoin, you never talk about bitcoin.

I wonder what is the possibility of importing so much material from mars that we fuck up the gravity of earth and Mars?
I guess if we circumvent this by exporting materials back out to Mars it wouldn't be as big of a deal.
It would be interesting if we could increase gravity on Mars to sustain an atmosphere and export excess water from global warming to work on Terra forming Mars as well.
Only issue is that Mars becomes ass cold compared to earth even with an atmosphere so good luck building a society there that can survive.
Mining Mars is something I can believe happening but Terra forming will prob never happen. I believe humans will live and die with earth.

If someone painted a different bit into that qr code they could change the address lol. If they claimed the Addy you could diff the two and see if yours only requires adding some symbols.
Good piece but im a paranoid parrot about these type of things that can be physically manipulated
Yea I get you put the address down too but some people might not pay attention to an extra block and they can paint over the address you wrote in

OK, assuming this is the reason it's 2016, why pick two weeks? Versus two days, or one week, and such?

Wouldn't the resources to validate a block become higher much sooner if we keep things as they are? At that point the scenario you mentioned of the power/integrity of the network being controlled by few players seems more likely to play out if 2x or some other optimization isn't implemented soon.

Hey I'm in the SM area, and I didn't hear any news about a block chain conference. Is there any website where stuff like this is announced? How'd you hear about it? I'd be interested in attending stuff in the LA area to stay up to date with news and developments.
