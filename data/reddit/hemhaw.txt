I work about 3 blocks from that bank.  Gotta say this kind of behavior is not surprising from a Lacey, WA resident.  Lacey is generally military trash town.

Making you laugh gets me $20 in BTC?  Well hell:
Alligator walks into a bar after a long day, sits down next to a blonde, and orders a drink.  Bartender replies, "Sorry bud, we can't serve alligators here."
Alligator replies, "Look man, I've had a long day, I just want one drink, and I'll be on my way."   Bartender replies, "Sorry 'gator, you gotta git."
Alligator says, "If you don't pour me a whiskey right now I'm going to swallow this blonde here whole.  You don't want that on your conscience, do you?  Pour the damn drink already!"  Bartender replies, "That's it, I'm calling the cops."
Alligator yells, "I've warned you!  Now you've forced me to do this!" and swallows the blonde at the bar whole.  "Look at what you've made me do!"  The bartender just shakes his head while on the phone with the police.
After a few seconds the alligator starts to feel sick.  "Uhh, wha.. what did you do to me?  You poisoned me!"  The alligator then faints.
A while later the alligator wakes up with the police and the bartender standing over him.  "What happened?" he asked them.
"I'm not sure," replied the bartender, "but it probably had something to do with that bar-bitch-you-ate."

Are any of these built tough enough to be able survive the recoil shock of being mounted to a rifle or shotgun?
