I had a consultation with Tyson Cross last Thursday. He was awesome and answered questions I had about taxes and Washington exchanges. I had scheduled a 1 hour session but didn't end up even using a half hour. He said he would end up refunding me the unused half hour.  I'm going to have him do my taxes this year.

If you're in it for the money, then just watch your purchase until you have a good cushion between when you bought in and where the price is. After you're more safe from losing money just ride it up.  You can always cash out but you'll never get these returns in a savings account.  By the way, you said it's not worth it unless you get $200K.  Wish we could all be so lucky.

The spike is due to everyone wanting to get into this before the split in November. Also it was about to break £5000 which caused it to boost, then that got us close to $7000 so now the US boosted the price. Now it's over $9000 AUD.  Even numbers are a big drawing point and the fact that it's close to all of the different world currencies makes it keep edging up.  That's my thought.
Nobody want's to be left behind and with ATH being reached all the time it is getting more exposure on the news. This draws in new money, along with the HODL mentality means the price keeps climbing. 
I'm not saying anything negative, just explaining what's going on here with the dramatic increase in price.

Anyone know of a good exchange for Washington State? Bitstamp and Gemini are not available here.
