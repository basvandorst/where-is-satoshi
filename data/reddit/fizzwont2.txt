They are paying everyone, I got a large withdrawal after the SuperBowl too. 
They are not scammers, btcsportsbet is the oldest bitcoin sportsbook and very trustworthy, I hope they get it sorted and can resume business, I'll be depositing day 1. All of these other sportsbooks are so shady.

That is ridiculous. They are being careful about money laundering given the recent news on Charlie Shrem. You can point them to the numerous articles about you and the cool High Stakes Living video or something. I'm going to get in touch with someone in management there that I know, hopefully can expedite for you.

It's likely they held on as long as they could so they didn't have to void all the Superbowl bets, which would have been messy.  Class act.

lol at spam ad for bitbook. The fact is btcsportsbet is the oldest and most trusted bitcoin book, and contrary to the article, has instant withdrawals.
Any serious bettor should look at btcsportsmatch.eu as well - vig free bet matching, like an exchange, for only 1% fee on won amount, by far the best odds around.
