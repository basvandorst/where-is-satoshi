I just want to be able to purchase bitcoins instantly. As soon as they fix this issue I'll be back! I'm sure it will only be a few months.

She used her card to purchase bitcoins to make paper wallets for her cousins as a Christmas present in 2013. 
It was on my account, and I helped her do it.

I would take my business elsewhere if there was a good alternative for me. Nowhere else has merchant services where I can sell my software, a good trading platform with an easy to use API (which I spent over a month integrating with), a free Bitcoin debit card (a nice backup if my regular card is messing up), and reoccurring purchases. I would love to use another service, but theirs offers the most. I don't mind that they track everything because all I do is buy and sell Bitcoins on their site.

It's such a bummer that they have all these issues. I really want to use them, and their merchant tools seem really awesome (they aren't working for me either). Hopefully they get their act together soon, or another company steps up and replaces them.

Gotcha, must of missed that, and thanks I wasn't aware of @_date: 2013-12-28 13:28:19
Well, it's not getting the new card that's hard. Can probably do it online. It would be the hassle of changing it on all of my online accounts (Paypal, Amazon, etc). Then I'd have to be without it until it arrives in the mail. Sorry that was my bad!
