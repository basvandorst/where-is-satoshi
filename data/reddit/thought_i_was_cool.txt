I didn't think we had forked yet...

Admittedly, I don't know.  I'm assuming you are talking about unborn fetuses here.  But this problem is not unique to the NAP, it's been a debate in the US for quite a while.
Children would have the same rights as their parents.


Whoever owns them or the property they are on.


Yes.  Similarly, I can't dump toxic chemicals upstream from your property either.  That would be an aggressive act.


These idiots will not own nice things for long.  Someone who can manage the land better will come along and buy them out.


Hopefully, your friends, family, neighbors, religious group, etc. would provide you with safety and security.  Basic goods and services should be cheap enough if we have a free market.  
I'm sure there will always be some level of poverty that we'll never be rid of.  Surely, forced wealth redistribution fails to solve this problem also.
It's not my job to take care of you.  I want you to be free to take care of yourself.

That's what property rights are for. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:31:23
You're goddamn right I am.  
Every single one of those things are either a) aren't needed or b) can be done better/more efficiently by the private sector and the free market.
I'm still waiting for you to tell me how Democratic Socialism is compatible with decentralized cryptocurrencies.  Good luck taxing people when you can't get your grubby hands on their money.  You'll have to use force to get your slice of the pie.  I guess that's okay with you, it should be easy once you round up all the guns, right?
Also, quit sending me rude PMs.  I'm not dumb or a pussy, and I'll happily debate you.  It might take me some time to reply though, because i have actual responsibilities unlike you.  Somebody's gotta pay for your healthcare, right?
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:39:42
Tell me more about how higher taxes = free market.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:43:58
Even if i believed you (I don't), it's irrelevant how much BTC you have or what kind of degree you have.  Neither your degree, nor the number in your bank account, is an argument.   
I'm not saying you don't know what Democratic Socialism is.  On the contrary, I think you know exactly what it is... and so do I. 
From the wikipedia article you linked, emphasis mine: 


So, again,  I ask you to tell me how this is compatible with the free market.  Tell me how this is compatible with decentralized cryptocurrencies.  Tell me how your system is not coercive.
edit: pro tip.  regulated free market is an oxymoron.

Who's going to protect it? lol

I guess we can end it here.  I'm not conceding; I have counter points to each of your paragraphs.  But I'll drop it , since there's no convincing either of us.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:53:04
How would kids not be protected by the NAP?  Are they not people?
Wild animals will be protected as private property.  Think about domestic dogs.  They are private property, and flourish because it.  Evolutionarily speaking, dogs are extremely successful.  Same with cows, horses, house cats, etc.  
If you own a large chunk of land, are you going to let people hunt the animals on your property to extinction?  No, that wouldn't be very profitable in the long term.  Ideally, you'd have them leave enough deer so that they can have a stable population and reproduce, allowing you hunt more year after year.

Guns, private security, defense contractors, etc.

You would be still free to do this with a group of people, you just can't force others to opt in to your system.  :)
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:28:01
Socialism is the opposite of free market.  Socialism is completely at odds with the fundamentals of BTC.


You're right, that does sound stupid.  I don't even know why you wrote this sentence, or even what it means.  We're are talking about economics, not physics.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:06:49
Why do you say this?
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:35:43
Your centrism is also a position.  Which of my "axioms" are flawed, and what do you propose instead?
I don't want utopia.  I want to be free.  That's all.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:03:02
Prove that you have over 10k BTC.  Also, You should burn your degree because you have learned nothing, and/or have been brain washed.
Tell me if I'm wong:  Democratic Socialism means having a robust social welfare program, and strongly regulated market.
Your system isn't voluntary, it's coercive.  Look, you can still have your hippy commune inside of my ideal society.  On the flip side though, I can't have my freedom-commune (for lack of a better term) within your borders without getting robbed.
edit:  originally said "Ummm...I think I'm one of the very few members in this sub with 10,000+ BTC...", which is why my comment asks him to prove he has 10k+.  He edited his post for some reason.  What's the matter PCI-DSS? Did you get caught in a lie?
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:42:00


Yes.  You can defend yourself.  


Yes you can hire an organization to defend yourself.


Their "legitimacy" is not for me to decide.  When they violate the NAP, break a contract, or violate my property rights, then they are now my enemy until the situation is rectified.  I will not do business with these types, nor should anyone else.  Anti-social activity has consequences (ostracism, etc).


Awesome!  They've discovered utopia!  I doubt this would ever happen though, which is why govt should be extremely limited or non-existent all together
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:44:12
, are you seeing this?

"...and moreover there is not motive for somone to do as you suggest."
Aren't there plenty of reasons why someone would manipulate a market?
You're right about the unfounded assertions, but if you notice there's a pattern then you might be able to make money off of it.

My understanding is that you'll want to have your coins in a wallet you control by the 31st, no matter what exchange you use.

Are they not letting people withdraw?
