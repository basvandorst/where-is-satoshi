This is awesome.  I love how it highlights the advantages of bitcoin.  Here are some current numbers for curious people, as of 2014 Mar 10 12:24 AM EDT.  Most transactions (85%) are in amounts less than 0.03 BTC.  So far there have been 1803 transactions; however, the top 1080 in value account for 95% of the total while the top 1448 account for 99% of the total.

If this guy doesn't work out, have you tried Citibank? Awhile ago I was in a similar situation and I thknk it's possible with a passport and proof of residence in your home country.  Failing that you could try crossing into Shenzhen and opening an account over there. I was able to open one with a hotel address.

That price is only meaningful to a subset of the market... The euro guys are already happy it's past 2500, the jpy guys and CNY guys have also just passed some psychologically significant milestones.

i think the issues with scalbility and security will be worked out eventually.  i am not so sure about volatility. maybe "once the market's big enough, it'll be harder to disturb" but that's kind of a hand-wavey conjecture and I would prefer something more concrete.  
also, you/they might want to look at off chain transactions, if you haven't already.  if i understand things correctly, the idea is that smaller value transactions can be performed instantly with the help of a semi-trusted third-party while the bitcoin block chain will typically be used for large value transactions.  
also, ripple?

it might just be a prudent fiscal move rather than a move of non-belief.  if you were worth say 1 mil and you made say 500k with bitcoin... i think  it would be very prudent to "rebalance" so that 33% of your net worth isn't concentrated into what is ultimately still a very risky venture.

it might help to show them how serious the core team is about the future of bitcoin as a payment protocol by watching the state of the union video from bitcoin2013 by gavin together.  it might be a bit dry though
