It would be very odd that neither Mt. Gox or the authorities are announcing the seizure.  If I was Karpeles I would be screaming to the rooftop about unfair government seizures, to get the Mt. Gox collapse pressure off of my back.

2014 will be the year of real government bitcoin regulation across many countries.  Many (e.g. Canada/US/Russia) have already announced this.

Yeah, it's not like the world's biggest bitcoin exchange didn't just recently defraud half a billion dollars worth of bitcoin or anything, making it the second largest financial loss in history next to Bernie Madoff.
I am not a Bitcoin hater, but bad news has certainly been creating more FUD than any good news has as of late.

You're right, but unlike a speculative bubble, the underlying asset will generate strong, long term value.  Just take a look at Amazon's incredible recovery.

yeah because you know, if I was running an extremely illegal silk road style dark web site that could land me in jail for the rest of my life, I would totally store the biggest piece of evidence that could secure my conviction within a traditional bank safety deposit box...

They said the same thing about the internet in the 90's... and for awhile, they were right.  But in the end, look where it's taken us.

You think MtGox was taken down by FBI seizures?

Better than Bitcoins where if your money gets stolen, it's gone forever.

"This is actually good news!" the Bitcoin advocate shouted, as his body was consumed by fire, charred flesh slapping the ground as it landed"
