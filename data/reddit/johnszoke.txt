Also I get the whole sending Bitcoin to an email thing... apparently just a subscription generator for Coinbase (duh).  Unless i'm incorrect I'm guessing that the only way to send Bitcoin to a peer is to send directly to their Bitcoin address...

You're a fine ambassador.  Thanks for the help.

Thanks for the info.  I went with Coinbase and Changetip originally due to their prevalence in the few conversations that i heard regarding Bitcoin.  I haven't heard of the wallets you're referring to, I'll definitely check them out...  
I will also check out the video you sent...
RE your comments that Coinbase and Changetip are "services"...  I'm assuming that your comment is hinting that the wallets that they provide aren't as secure since they have the keys, and those could in a worst case scenario be compromised?  I'm also assuming that Electrum/mobile wallets are perhaps not as user friendly, since I'd be responsible for additional data that Coinbase currently takes care of?
Thanks again.

Who is the troll?

Please point me out to the best location for someone with no experience with bitcoin (and/or reddit) to find out all of the ways to exchange, receive, and manage accounts.  From my searches, that would be Reddit.

Great list, love how BTC makes contributing to charitable causes fast, safe, and easy!

That was me, and you are correct, there are no good tutorials for wallet management and exchange processes.
