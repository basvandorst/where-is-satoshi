Or how lending on an anonymous, untraceable platform is preferable to the current system.  Make no mistake, the current system is certainly flawed but extending credit where lender(s) have no-recourse is a plan for disaster.

Start with 8+ figures of bitcoin.

Is it scary? Of course not. Read my post again. I would like to see an alternative emerge. 
Ask yourself, why aren't there more adopters today? Your answer may be this is a relatively new tech or something along those lines. I'll concede that point. But what about in a year from now or five years from now? If the question is still being asked it may be because there remains a lack of confidence in Bitcoin. 
Why a lack of confidence?  Why so few adopters? Because there's no control or mechanism in place reassuring the masses that their money is safe and this is a reliable alternative. The other posters pointed out that control can be about giving people the perception of safety. Regulations can be as simple as providing liquidity in the currency.
Is it easier for one to get $1000 from a bank or 1 BTC?  For the 20 something crowd maybe the answer is 1 BTC. For other age demos, the answer is probably the bank for most people. Why would they give that answer? 
Folks, as much I want to see this and other ideas in the world succeed, I am a realist. The fact is we live in a world that has limitations and control. So we have to play that game. The idea is to do the most that we can within this paradigm with minimal control. Anything outside of that will have significant difficulty succeeding. That's where volatility stems from - uncertainty and doubt.

This isn't dogma, as you say. This is economic theory and this theory whether you like it or not governs the world we live in.  Listen closely as I am not trying to poison the well. Quite the contrary I would like to see alternative forms of currency do well and become commonplace. But it simply does not or will not work in the absence of some regulation. 
If anyone out there has been under a rock for the last five years then you have missed what triggered the financial collapse which we are still recovering from. It was the deregulation or non regulation of credit default swaps, real estate lending among others. The result: a bubble that burst akin to what we just witnessed in Bitcoin. There's no poisoning in me making a prediction in the direction it's heading. Quite simply it's history repeating itself. I'm old enough to see this happen on several occasions.

Bitcoin will head lower.  What most investors / users fail to realize is that some control and regulations is needed for ANY currency. In the absence of that these volatility swings are to be the norm.  Eventually users will tire of the uncertainty which will send the value back to under $100

Exactly. You need to this to get a seat at the table to play with the existing monopoly, the USD / other currencies.  Until you get that seat, most folks aren't interested as there's no legitimacy of BTC in their mind.

And thank you for all of the imaginary points.
