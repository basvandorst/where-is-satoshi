It means that while its still rare enough that no one you know might be affected, over the large statistical population of the world, its a enormous problem costing billions of dollars each year.

Are you serious?  A Japanese-American man not using Feather blades, the blades made in his place of birth?  Not to mention far and away the best DE blades I've ever used...
Definitely not Satoshi.

I guess it makes sense that you can't buy the book with Bitcoins, after all, you have to buy the book and read it to master them first.

It's exactly the right way of looking at it. The reason for almost every problem we have is that people want to take the easy way out instead of doing what's right, all the time, every time. 
If everyone did the right thing, every time, we'd be living in as close to a Star Trek utopia as possible. But instead we have a lot of cowards who value their ultimately meaningless lives and comfort over the collective good of the species.

Came to say this... I started mining with my GPU, then was lucky enough to get a Butterfly Labs Jalapeno... mined 122 coins and intend to hang onto them... I was stupid enough to spend 4 of them when they peaked around $1100 some years ago, buying new PC parts.
My $4400 PC is now "worth" $28,000... feelsbadman.

The actual root of the problem is retiring at 45, not paying taxes, and voting in more politicians that you think are going to keep supporting that shit.
The fact Greece even has a politician remotely angling for this shit is laughable.  These fuckers wanted to skip out on paying taxes... they wanted to be lazy fucks who'd work for 27 years after leaving high school and then sit on the government dole the rest of their lives...
Fuck. Them.  This old man is only one who has my sympathy, because he's too old to have participated in most of that shit, but anyone in that nation that's in their late 20s / early 30s to their mid to late 50s can fucking starve.
Hard to fucking believe these are the people that Western civilization is descended from.

I did the same but I'm getting a little nervous now... I was fortunate enough to get a Butterfly Labs miner back when difficulty was 12,500,000.
I mined 122 BTC before finally shutting it down due to power costs.  I held strong when it hit $1200, using 4 BTC to order parts to build a new machine, and I'm now sitting at 118 BTC.  That's basically $300,000.  I'm torn because this is a great time to get off the train, but if the fuckers hit $10,000 someday, I'll be well on my way to retirement, so I'm really dumbfounded as to what to do.

I'm sitting on 118.59 BTC that I mined from way back in the early 2010s... I would have had about 122.30 or so but I used a little under 4 BTC to buy parts to build a bitchin new computer when BTC hit $1200.  Now I'm wishing I had left that shit alone.
I was biting my nails at $1250, and now I'm damn near ready to pull out my hair.  But I I'm going to ride this train all the way into the station...
**$10,000 in 2020, here we come!!**
ALL ABOARD THE BTC TRAIN!!

No way baby, riding this train all the way into the station...

Bitcoin did have that for me... well over, in fact.
I got my Butterfly Labs miner back when the network difficulty was only 12,500,000.  I can't remember what BTC were at that time... maybe $126, or so?  Needless to say, having a 25 GH/s miner then was a license to print BTC, and I mined tons of them.  Still have around 113 today, which I am hanging onto.  I suspect Bitcoins will continue to rise in value.
