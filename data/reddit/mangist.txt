how do you define a trend then?

They were right though

It's actually doubled in value in the last year...

Africa has bigger problems to worry about, a digital currency is not even close to being on that list.  Internet access is so poor, I can't imagine how this would work in the near future.  When you upgraded your phone to a smartphone a decade ago, that old Nokia went to Africa, and it's still being used.  It's just a different level of technology altogether.
Grew up in Africa, have seen quite a bit of it.

In any normal environment, and admin should be able to reset your password. They should never be asking you for it.
In this case, it's a Bitcoin wallet private key, so they can't reset it. I'm not sure why they would need it, but I still would never give it out (unless I emptied the wallet first).

Poverty, famine, disease, corruption.  Bitcoin will not solve any of these problems.

This should be the top comment.  My thoughts exactly, people are treating Bitcoin like a commodity or speculative investment instead of seeing it for what it is.  They are hoarding coins hoping to make money.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:42:36
You're treating Bitcoin like a commodity. What makes you think the price should be higher than it is now? A good price for BTC may be $10 USD. Bitcoins are constantly being mined, so new supply is keeping prices down. I wouldn't be surprised to see it stabilize around $100 USD for a few years.
In the meantime, keep only a small amount of BTC in your wallet, and use it for transactions. Don't hoard it like gold in the hopes that it will increase in value, you're missing the point of what BTC is supposed to be.

What app is best for them to pay with on their phone when scanning a QR code?
What exactly is the data encoded into the QR code?  I need it to be compatible with existing mobile wallet apps so I don't have to write my own.

I'm not backing the author, just raising the question of the possibility of central bank intervention.  It's an interesting idea, and the first time I've heard of anyone suggest it, so I thought it would make for a good discussion.

I got my USD funds out by wire in October 2013.  It took a few weeks but I got the money.

I am a programmer, I wrote the kiosk software.  Was just looking for best practice on approaching this problem.  What would be the best end user experience?
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:24:14
Hahaha, on huge volume of 800 transactions.  Russia is scrambling to get their hands on Bitcoins!!!

Good call, didn't know that just read the article this morning and thought I'd share.

I think he was referring to the US population, not world population.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:39:25
That is a large portion of the population.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:04:17
Gold or stocks. And yes, a large portion of the US population hold stocks through their 401(k) retirement accounts or IRAs, pensions etc.

What??? LOL.

Yes he can?

ARS Technica are well regarded as legitimate journalists. I don't think this is purely rumor.

It's a really huge win for Bitcoin. Obviously the idea was to eliminate the need for banks but this is a necessary transition.
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:22:12
Yeah yeah it defeats the point, but it's a good first step in a transition to multi currency and then crypto currency. They are putting their faith in the Bitcoin system as being a viable currency, it's good news.
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:20:25
That's a big gamble on Reddit still being here in 40 years!
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:19:02
It's not ideal but it's a necessary transitionary phase that needs to happen.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:19:48


@_date: 2013-12-20 18:29:42
I agree, defeats the point if you're just converting back to dollars.  If everyone started accepting Bitcoin and didn't convert to dollars, then dollars would eventually lose their value as less and less people would be transacting with them.

@_date: 2013-12-20 18:07:23
Why bother accepting Bitcoin if you're just going to convert to fiat?  Doesn't that defeat the whole point?
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:59:15
You're not wrong, but think about how much more money is involved.  At 25 BTC per block, and 6 blocks per hour (144 blocks per day), there are 3,600 new BTC mined every day.  Each BTC costs $381 to mine?
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:07:53
I have no doubt :)
But as a new currency, the raw material cost of creating BTC is interesting to see.  At some point the difficulty is going to be so high, that surely with the electricity costs it wouldn't be profitable to mine at all?
