Congrats micronation off the coast of Portugal. Way to go just lead the way. 
Hey everyone I just self-proclaimed that I am the king of electrodigital crytpo realms. All mining of cryptocurrency in cyberspace will now have my Royal seal.
 Please let me in your new fancy club?

They are in the right agreed. It wasn't like paypal took it down off of FB himself. More likey a program just caught it and down it came without so much as a thought from evil paypal.
But because it's paypal... for just a moment my obtuse version where Bitcoin is kicking paypals ass is a short lived hollow indulgence.
I know we are better than that, but I do hate paypal.

Ahh yessss...it's paypals FEAR that's it. Way togo Dave!!!! You scared paypal.
 "Chip away at the stone" by Areosmith comes to mind.

Is that why I have Namecheap looking to verify me after my purchases? Now they want a bunch of id which the site never prompted me for in the check out.

Sounds like a stress test triangle. 
I thought bitstamp was based in the UK or Slovenia? 
So if you're money is in the Cayman Islands your good, but if you have money in bitstamp then you have to record and document?  Wow

It would seem that the old guard (financial and governments) have alot more sway in how all of this is evolving than I originally thought.  Its just a users opinion but decentralized control looks more and more like an illusion.
