The only time I’ve lost money with bitcoin is by setting sell orders and not checking for a day or two.
Then I end up buying back st a higher a price...

Dude, someone calls bitcoin a fraud and the market contracts aids almost instantaneously . It is the epitome of volatile, still love it though

If you believed it was going to crash , then take your money out. If You don’t, leave it in. If your comfortable with sacrificing the possibly of future gains by reducing your hypothetical loss, take out in increments. I go through this thought process constantly

Somewhat yes. Buying directly from coinbase is different than buying on gdax tho. Your not buying directly from coinbase on gdax, rather coinbase is facilitating the trades/transfers

Ya of course it is that what I does, then it goes back up, then crashes. Hints the rollercoaster meme 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:11:22
STOP USING COINBASE. Sign up for a trading like polionex or gdax, for the Love of Moses

Local bitcoin, but check out gdax. It's a trading platform connected to coinbase. The only wait u would have is sending funds into your usd wallet. When you have the fiat in your usd wallet the bitcoin purchases/sales are instant.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:52:57
No I don't., my explanation probably makes it sound more confusing then it really is. There are a ton of vids on YouTube as well which give a basic overview of the gdax platform and it's rudimentary functions

With all the various dips lately, bitcoin getting big(for lack of a better term) and the volatility in general, I have come to conclusion always keep money ready to buy a dip. Don't let the fomo get the better of you. I am a firm hodler but always like to have cash ready to utilize 
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:17:38
1. Deposit fiat funds (I.e. Usd) into coinbase( this will take time, but you are not beholden to a crypto price this way. Forgot about the fomo on a rally, remember try to buy the dips). This lag time has saved and fucked me a few times.
2. Go to gdax.com. Your coinbase account is linked to this site.
3. Transfer fiat from coinbase to gdax( no fee from what I understand.) 
4. Buy bitcoin, litecoin, or eth with very very small fees something like .025%. And instant as well. You can also set buy and sell orders
Happy trading

Everyone worrying right now let’s not forget China. For during the great Chinese cold month we all felt pain. But those that were brave enough to whether the storm were significantly rewarded. Brave the storm 
Yay , praise the coin.

Ok buddy, calm down. A simple “the official website would be your best bet” would of sufficed. Not need to vent your inner frustrations in a passive aggressive manner through a reddit post... thanks tho I guess��

Went to a seminar tonight... total horse doodoo.
Just $12,000.. don't waste your time. buy a book, watch YouTube videos, much cheaper and more informative than this. The cost for the classes could get you well on your way with some cyber currency
