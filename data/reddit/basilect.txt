And which one was Bear Stearns?

The invisible fedora of the market, if you will.

Do you have one person just calling you "buttcoiner" to harass you from like 5 different alts? :(

the price skyrocketing is absolutely bad for Bitcoin, I'm much more comfortable with a stable exchange rate instead of something that grips headlines for 2 weeks and then people lose their shirt.
I have enough risk in my life!

Implying Bitcoin isn't Chinese? It's a gambling technology that is day traded, with a small hobbyist community.

But have the electronic transaction mechanisms for it always been on line? Visa and MasterCard?

But if you're dealing with a huge amount of people voting, won't just the smallest possible change be picked every time?

In China? Capital controls are a huge driver of bitcoin use in Asia.

Would coinbase downtime affect a bitcoin user more than visa going down affect an average Joe?

CNBC reported something alarmist?
Okay, was this drop bigger than 1) the GDP (annual income) of the two countries, 2) a hypothetical value of the country's government, or 3) a hypothetical value of the entire country?

No, because the price slump is probably pricing in the uncertainty of a possible fork in the blockchain.

People have the same arguments about settlement mechanisms in US dollars, but they're done in boardrooms instead of forums and mailing lists.

That's an exceptionally poor reading of the parent comment.

Yeah, Skype was written by Estonians, not Aussies

It's not market manipulation if it's a couple of million people discovering a new way to get around currency controls!

It's Japan, they barely have Violent crime anyway. He'll be doing time with the pachinko game riggers, the tax embezzlers, and the granny extorters.

Don't you lose some guarantees on integrity when you do that?

Sorry, I was completely agreeing with you. It's essentially like turning on the winklevoss twins for being anti-bitcoin and trying to centralize it.
I mean seriously, the decentralization is an integral part of the technology, and something that is being actively exploited for use elsewhere. The fact that they happen to have a developer, for bitcoin, on staff while they're making huge investments in the technology, should not be surprising.

Stability is more important than hitting these high numbers.

Andreesen Horowitz has always been an enemy of Bitcoin.
We have always been at war with Eastasia.
