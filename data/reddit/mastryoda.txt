Don't be an idiot.  They are converting their savings to bitcoin...not their daily living expenses.
For instance...You have 100K in euros.  You put 90k into bitcoin, and feed your family with the other 10k for the next few months.

How exactly did it hurt his family?  Didn't get get like $25,000 in bitcoins (while he was unemployed), a free lunch and get put on the cover of a major magazine?

I don't know...take a ferry to italy and exchange bitcoins for euros there.   Drive an hour or 2 to the next country and exchange bitcoins there.  Lots of options.  Hell...take your last 1500 euros and fly to america or china where lots of people will buy your bitcoins.

What? I can convert $50k per day to bitcoin through coinbase.

First off, let me say sorry for your loss.  Unfortunately your story is one of many.  90% of traders lose money.   I'm going to correct you on your average cost per bitcoin.  Since you were using margin on bitfinix, your average cost per bitcoin is NOT $623 each.  Its $1,881 each.  If you started with $300k and you now have $55k, thats the price you need bitcoin to reach in a non-margined account to break even.
Trading on Margin is the devil.  Its hard to make money that way because you panic twice as much when the price goes down.  I lost tons of money trading on Margin (stock market) and found I never made money until I stopped using margin.  I know its tempting to make that money twice as fast, but you just shouldnt do it.
If you are going to ride this horse all the way through, at least get your money out of bitfinix so you stop using margin.  Also stop trading...you've determined your not good at it.  Buy, hold and wait...that is really the only chance in hell you have of ever getting that money back and even then, the chances are only 50/50.

In 2009 I bought $10,000 worth of silver.  I was terrified where to keep it.  Do i keep it in my house?  Do I pay to put it in a bank?  Do I bury it?   After a few months, you get over the fear of losing it.  Same with bitcoin.  You first get into it and you're scared of losing it.  Taking care of your own money is scary the first time you do it...But I also notice that those people that do the most to protect their wallets always seem to be the guys that get hacked.

Yeah, would've been great advertising....if he actually used the word BITCOIN in his sign.   I promise you...people who have never heard of bitcoin  are not going to know what the big letter B is for and people that actually know what QR codes are and don't know what bitcoin is, are going to scan it and see 138WVhT699GMyWsRbeKXSQXL5zvpixctbT and be like...wtf is this?

Except one small problem...if I lose power to the internet (or lose power at all) my gold is still there and I can use it.  With bitcoin, I can't.
This is what I don't get about bitcoin...I mean assume the worst happens...fiat money collapses.  Woo hoo...a bitcoin is worth a million dollars.  You're all rich, right?  Well if fiat collapses, you can be sure that the power infrastructure is going to go out too and when the power goes out, how are you going to use bitcoin?  You need the power and internet to be back on for you to make transactions to each other. 
Don't get me wrong...I use bitcoin at least once per month to send money overseas.  Its definitely good and cheap for that use, but I don't hold any bitcoin.  At least 95% of you are holding bitcoin in the hopes that one day you're going to be rich...thats what makes bitcoin valuable right now.  Don't fool yourselves into thinking its some kind of safeguard from economic collapse.   You're all just gambling right now.

From my perspective, the bitcoin is evil!
@_date: 2016-01-02 21:10:19
Yes I understand that the bitcoin private key is still there, but suppose fiat becomes worthless and power is off for a month.  The fact is, you can't spend that bitcoin for that month and I'll tell you this...the people that have the food, bullets and anything else you need are not going to know what the hell an ecrypted cypherpunk meshnet is and you're going to have a hell of a time convincing them to take bitcoin when they have no idea when the power is coming back on.   In the event of a combination fiat/power system collapse, normal average everyday people are going to scramble for gold and silver...not bitcoin.  Remember that 99% of people have no idea how bitcoin works or even how to get it right now and pretty much everyone knows how gold and silver works.  And as long as the lights are on, besides transfering money at low costs and quickly, I can't see why ORDINARY people would use bitcoin for anything else other than that.

I think security should be...
Precious Metals: Someone has to physically come take it, and you have some ability to stop them.
Fiat:  Someone has to physically come take if its in cash and only the government can take it if its in a bank and you have some ability to stop them (either physically or through the courts)
Bitcoin:  Someone you never met from the other side of the world could take it and you have no recourse to get it back...EVER.

Its exactly true.  Nobody in bitcoin in 2011 or before seriously thought bitcoin would hit $100...EVER.  The majority of people in bitcoin entered in the last part of 2013 and early 2014.  My post is just catering to when the MAJORITY of people got in.  Not the 10 or 15 people who got in when bitcoin was selling for $30 per 10,000 coins.

$10 (or .03 bitcoin) to watch a video that will scare me into buying a product I already believe in?  No thanks.
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:54:50
A lot of people produce videos and don't charge for it.  They just put it on youtube and either do product placements,and/or just collect ad revenue.  I mean, it only costs me $6.99 to stream a brand new movie on PPV that costs $50-$100 million dollars to make. How much did these guys spend to make the video?   If you produce something, at least be on par with your competition.  Don't think you can spend $10k to produce a video and I'm going to pay $10 for it.

Coinbase is the safest.  They are insured against theft and loss of bitcoin.[source](  Keep the bulk of your bitcoins there.  Thats what I do.  I do keep like $40 or so in my blockchain app for spending on the go, but pretty much coinbase is good for holding your coins.
Of course the "pros" on here will balk at the idea of keeping bitcoins with coinbase for various reasons, but for a noob, coinbase is the best.  
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:17:39
But it's not always about security.  Its also about getting your coins back if you lose them to something thats not your fault.
Example:  Your house burns down and your trezor and info to recover bitcoins on your trezor all goes up in smoke.
