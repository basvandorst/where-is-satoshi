C'mon Tim, how much per coin?  Can anyone present an argument for or against keeping it secret?  Also, where are these 'emerging markets?'

WTF?!!  Conventional markets are crashing.  Are big BTC investors cashing out in order to cover their losses/ margin calls?  What ever the case, this is jacked up.  You'd think those venture capitalist would have built some reputable exchanges so that they could have protected their investments better.   There is absolutely no logic for the shitty price.  And for everyone of you who says the price does not matter, you are so full of shit.  I agree it isn't 100% relevant, but it's damn well north of 51% relevant.

I agree with your last paragraph, that is absolutely bigger news.  However, regarding LBC, it just seems like we're far enough in the game here that they should move out of their mother's basement and to reliable hosting service, of which there are many.  In other words, are we not past amateur hour yet?  
@_date: 2014-05-19 12:53:31
You're right, this should be much bigger news

This is a real problem for those entering into bitcoin.  For those unfortunate enough to be trapped in the US, newbs only have coinbase and localbitcoin.  Well, today, they only have coinbase.  And the rest of the planet is SOL.  Yes, yes I know there are other options, but it has become general practice to just tell newbs "use coinbase or localbitcoins."  I know there is a ton of money flowing into the BTC space, but apparently not enough is being spent on reliability.

Institutional money cannot buy through the exchanges.  They'll be bidders tomorrow.  I predict a 15 to 20% premium.  And, no way in hell will these be dumped on any exchanges.  Big money is looking at this as a low overhead point of entry.  When we get to $1500 +, you'll start seeing them sell.

Localbitcoins is great when it is up.  Lately, the duct tape has been coming off a lot.  Always get your coins off of LBTC as quickly as possible.

In order to TRADE and make a market, funds and btc must be on these exchanges.  Part of the overall price decline is people taking their assets off the exchanges and thus low volume which adds to price decline.

This is a big deal.  This guy speaks to the baby boomers and they listen to him.  He's even got a Casey Research guy on there.  For all the 55 year and older subscribers to Mauldin have heard about bitcoin from their grandkids.  Now they have permission to dive in, because a "SAFE" investment adviser says so.

I think we are bottom scraping.  We might see $200 again before the rise, but upward energy is coiling up so a pop may happen soon.

bastante ignorante articulo, pero es muy bueno porque es en la mas grande diario de Chile.    
Fairly ignorant article, but is is very good because it is in Chile's largest newspaper.  
Chile's economy is without question the strongest in South America.  This strong economy has actually kept the lid on btc, because the overall population hasn't seen the need for it.  This article will help spread awareness.
