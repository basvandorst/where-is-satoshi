This is definitely the Bitcoin dream. But I think it would be really dumb to assume something else can't come along that functions better.  In 1000 years if they are using Bitcoin I would be pretty surprised.

No you don't understand what tether is!!  This whole thing stems from one guy on Twitter misinforming a ton of people in what tether is.  How in fuck can you believe tether printing supported the bull market and not mass adoption.. there is only just over 1billion tether out there and the cryptocurrency market cap is approaching 1 trillion.
Just to say it again. Tether is created when people WITHDRAW from finex. The money in finex is a bunch of big whales. If someone wants to move some cash to buy alts they do a tether withdraw to another exchange.  Those dollars go into the tether bank account and tether is shipped to another exchange.
All this bullshit about it being printed money was entirely fabricated by a guy on Twitter named bitfinexed. He clearly has an axe to grind about the entire crypto ecosystem and has a conspiracy theory for literally every market action on any exchange.  He post hundreds of times a week and obviously has some obsessive schizophrenic disorder.
New people read his posts and like most conspiracy theories sound like they follow a system of logic. EXCEPT he completely miss represents when tethers are created to a bunch of people that don't know better.
The reason there is no correlation in price there is that it's not money being printed to buy coin. It's money that was just created by selling coin then moved around then bought different coins.
Bitfinex makes millions a day in trading fees. Why in fuck would they do the things alleged against them and jeapordize that?
I hate how gullible everyone has been in this subject.  It couldn't possibly be that everyone's mom Uncle and dog got into cryptocurrency.. that cnbc started running crytpo programs all day... No... It's the 1 billion in tether that created this entire bill run???
Get fucking real. I get so pissed hearing this because it's so obviously wrong.

I think the sentiment at the start of banks themselves to a lot of shady shit with our money.  There is very little oversight and inspection. And when there is an issue that comes to light it's a slap on the wrist.
They literally tanked or economy less then 10 years selling shitty housing derivatives.
So yea.. it seems a little odd when they shove the probe into your asshole when they can sort of do whatever the fuck they want on the other end.
aaaasssssnd.  Pedantic asshole actually defending greed incarnate

Well it's the epitome of what's wrong now. Plagarized white paper.. code is just ethereum copy with the copyright deleted.. "offices" in San Francisco are just a 400$ a month desk at a coworking space.. guy took a picture with Alibaba guy after a speech and claimed to be mentored by him...
Yet billions of dollars in valuation. Pure stupidity and greed documented on a chart
That being said I also think cryptocurrency clearly went through a mania phase and we are going to enter a medium term bear market.  Bitcoin will need to have implemented more scaling solutions.. maybe get some good news via rootstock it maybe an ETF.. something to make fundamentals exciting again. And then the bull will come back.  IMO next stop is 8k.. then bounce to where we are now. Then depending on how far we are from those fundamental improvements we will be going down to 5k to consolidate.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:41:35
And you are like the old man ignoring the illness on his body and saying everything is fine. Bitcoin needs to start seriously making progress on scaling.

Actually the largest heist in the history of the world happened in a cryptocurrency exchange last night. Exactly when the crash started.  That's why things crashed.. this wall street bullshit is nothing.  Bitcoin has had futures did many years. Nothing is new with the tiny volume cme futures.
700 billion stolen btw. That can spook a market that had it's last bear market start from an exchange hack

Just zoom out. I repeat this so the time and even antonoplolous says this.  This revolution will be a series of bubbles. But just a straight line up.  IMO we are due for a bear market consultation cycle. I think if your a hodler it's time to stop checking because it's gonna go a lot more down before it goes up.  
Maybe in 6 months to a year as lightning channels get worked out and become ubiquitous. Rootstock smart contracts get going and maybe an ETF gets launched. Then Bitcoin will be ready for another parabolic move.
But we are about to get the mean time and it's gonna be painful if your looking at price every day.
The bear market is the time you look at the tech advancements every day. Development becomes more focused and this community will slowly dwindle down to zero price threads and only tech threads. 
So embrace it. This decline and consolidation is just the first step into the next great cycle.
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:39:51
Hate to break it to you but a lot of people don't want to sit through a bear market. Which is also a natural cycle in markets.  You can post all the memes you want but price had an insane move this year and needs a correction.
Now if the time you decide if you're willing to hold down to 8k 6k 4k... Because that's probably going to happen in the next few months. It will round out in the bottom right at the threshold where most people will say fuck it in out. That's where the smart patient money will say finally.. I'm in.  
Then some lightning network implantations that see meaningful will happen.. perhaps an ETF will be approved.. some economic issue somewhere.. and the price will start to curve back up again and we will get to see the next bubble.
Even antonoplolous says this will be a series of bubbles.  
So post whatever memes you need to help you hodl tight.  Just make sure your choosing that all the way down to 5k.. even 3k.. because it's possible. That would still leave price up 10x from the previous consolidation phase.
So your meme will need readjusting but it will work fine for all the people that bought at 300.
This is a mania phase now. It won't last forever. Next comes the part where all the people late to the party have to clean up the mess. Sorry

There has never been proof the traders
Tether is fraudulent either.. they are in the process of an audit and the auditor already wrote a memo saying the money was in the bank. But to fully audit it they have to do a deep audit at many banks around the world because finex takes in deposits from all over the world for many years.
The doubt surrounding it came from a single Twitter user too. Named bitfinex do that clearly has an axe to grind against the Bitcoin ecosystem in general.  If you take his word for it the entire price rise in the last year was manipulation. Not general adoption which is absolutely absurd.
On top of that the money bitfinex makes in exchange fees vastly dwarfs whatever kind of profit could be made on creating fair tethers and jeapordizes their entire operation to create a fraudulent currency.  Why in hell would they do that? They make millions a day in trading fees... You actually believe they are just creating tether out of free air and handing it out or something.
Imo there needs to be an education campaign so people aren't so easily miss informed on what tether is.  For example in bitfinex it is dollars traded. Not tether. Tether is only generated when a user wants to withdraw dollars from finex in the form of tether. It either goes to another exchange as tether and the dollars go into the tether bank account. Or it sits in someone's tether wallet.  
It is not created out of no where. That is rumor originated from one clearly obsessive troll.  The real shame is how many people but into that bullshit. 
Why in fuck woukd s company making so much just being exchange jeapordize that on so little?  Thiiiiiinnnkkkkkkkkkkk. Why does kraken bittrex binance all trust that tether is genuine.  2 if those companies operate out of America.  They would not jump in bed without doing due diligence.
This shit is unbearable.  You are all recreating a meme created by one troll on Twitter and it can potentially fuck up the ecosystem to not have fiat crypto that can be sent around for arbitrage

@_date: 2018-01-30 01:00:35
Thanks Danish
But I think we need a few more months of bear to squeeze some of the new alts that bloated up too far.  I think the new money needs to be reducated on why Bitcoin still has a better potential and use case then those random alts that are basically just 2 year road maps.  When lightning is ubiquitous and some icos start getting launched through rootstock there shorts be a really Revelation moment that those new people coming in eating up the alt market then move to BTC and start the next bull run.
IMO were months away at least and could see 8 it even 6k before fishy turning around and moving up
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:47:14
Dude you're delusional.. I have friends texting me about crypto that I never thought would be getting into the scene.
You know what the common denominator is.  Every single one of them thinks Bitcoin doesn't work compared to their favorite alt. None of the people coming in now want anything to do with Bitcoin. Just look how all the alts are exploding.
Bitcoin has the momentum of first mover advantage but if it doesn't start figuring out how to scale it's not going to stay in the lead
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:31:01
Wall Street is not  manipulating price. If anyone is it's the same whales that always did.
Bitcoin has had futures with vastly more volume for many years now.  If it's manipulated it's has been and will continue to be manipulated by the whales that play those futures.  Bitmex and okcoin will do the entire open interest on the cme products in a day.
This narrative is absurd grasping at straws for people that need an excuse for a market to pull back after a massive parabolic move other then... It just had a massive parabolic move....
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:25:36
That's cool and all and I love crytpo for this... But if those Venezuelans bought BTC last month it's also lost half itse value.  If wealth preservation is the goal they are better off buying tether or that new yen equivalent coming soon.  I love bitcoin and I think one day many years from now and at a way higher price it will probably stabilize and become a wealth preservation asset. But it's still a highly speculative volitile asset now.  It could go down to 6k and consolidate a while before finally moving back up.  IMO it's not the best time to market it to poor people.  It's value could drop faster then the Venezuela currency.

I think you underestimate how many people are not investing in Bitcoin because it's not attached to a traditional market. The winklevi don't even have enough Bitcoin to cover that demand.

It's not whether it could be great. It's what happens during the year long dump and consolidation if a contentious fork becomes innevitable.

This is a major issue. I don't think they understand that in the long term they will make more money with segwit even if short term it isn't as immediately profitable.
This will be very hard. They are a poor culture and can lack vision at times. They literally have entire copies of famous cities and a booming fake iPhone business.  They care about money.  Not innovation.
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:07:07
No. That would be intense demand by people that only invest in things that pass the scrutiny of the government.  
So it proves demand but it's not blocked by the sec. It's blocked by the dopes that need a government agency to tell them what to do.
It's kinda like saying Dwayne Johnson is blocking Bitcoin by not endorsing it and offering a purchase Bitcoin option on his website.
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:47:28
You forgot the main issue. Segwit isn't immediately profitable for miners. Instead it's a long-term plan that will allow Bitcoin to become mainstream and eventually generate more money for miners.
Miners instead want an immediately profitable simplistic solution.  
It's really that simple. Miners want what's most profitable for them. Core wants to develop something with long term functionality

China is really good at recognizing good ideas. Not so much coming up with them.  They recognize this is the future and are trying to work with it. They won't ban it.  I think they are going to try to incorporate it more in their economy. Maybe recommend storing value there and withdrawing to yuan for purchases.
I think something big is looming with them and Bitcoin.  Limiting leverage is good. I think we are on the cusp of a big boom with news from them in the next week's.

He didnt mention asicboost scandal at all.  A group of miners had/have a hidden advantage called asicboost when mining.  They profit greatly off of segwit not being activated as it nullifies this advantage.  It also causes all the hardware manufactured for this purpose to loose its value.  
He also didnt mention that a hardfork to bigger blocksize was always intended, but core developers wanted to be precautious and make sure they got a laundry list of other upgrades into that hardfork aswell so bitcoin code isnt splitting all the time.  It is confusing to hardfork bitcoin, especially if its contentious.  So they wanted to get a lot in on the fork.  Not just a single upgrade.

How is there an issue with deflation if there is a fixed supply?
Isnt the volatility just caused by it being in a state of infancy for a global currency?  Its marketcap isnt even close to a currency right now.  When its 10000$ a bitcoin and people are talking about bits instead of bitcoins 5000$ swings will be nothing.  Essentially the same as the dollar.

If you guys dont know most of the bcc coins are still locked away on exchanges.  Within a minute or two of bitfinex having the withdrawl process ready you can expect a very massive dump.  Right now its value is being derived by bittrex pump and dump traders.  Its supply is EXTREMELY limited right yet coin marketcap is displaying as though all coins are in free circulation.  This coin will fall to at most 500 million market cap when coins are released.

This is exactly right.  We need to make sure 2x doesnt  happen now.  The bigger block size experiment can happen on bcash.

Segwit 2x will cause sooo much confusion in the market it might kill cryptocurrency in general for a long time.  No new buyers will know which coin to buy.  Old buyers will see value slowly drop and sell.  The speculators will leave and price will probably go back down to under 1000.
That will be the end of crypto currency investing for a long time.  I understand the idea of developing the technology being paramount but it is foolish to forget that this is also a currency.  If its value drops so drastically its over. For a long long long time.
If i wear a tinfoil hat.. it looks to me like those that signed the NYA and then contributed to bcash are trying to create a situation in which the main developed bitcoin splits in 2 and value is driven into their altcoin... bitcoin cash.  
It is really important to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies success that segwit 2x does not activate.  Allow segwit to be developed and allow the hardfork to a larger blocksize to happen when the developers are able to include all the upgrades and cleanup work they want in a hardfork.  Slow steady development is key.  Not causing the appearance of unnecessary conflict is important.

All that's great. Unless there is a contentious hard fork. Which is looming.  Bitcoin is great. But there's a cut the baby in half or give it up situation happening.  And one side is totally OK cutting the baby in half.
In a few months when a hard fork is inevitable expect another crash.  Then expect people to wonder what monero is and if it has all the same unstable drama Bitcoin does.. a lot of people just won't move back into Bitcoin after it splits.  It at the very least a year long consolidation around 100 to 200$. I think there's a good chance Bitcoin is dead in 5 years of they can't work that drama out.

@_date: 2016-12-09 04:20:41
If you want bitcoin to be mainstream it's goal can't be hiding from the government. Then it will be underground. It will never take off because most people want to pay their taxes and go to church and work hard. 
Use another coin if you need to do something nefarious. If you want bitcoin to become mainstream you have to accept some compromise.

No. Coinbase is giving you the opportunity to give that power back. Not everyone wants all their value in a hardware wallet.

We can hard fork.. Thats not the problem.  Bitcoin will have to hardfork at some point to upgrade.  The problem is rushing an unneccecary one that wont include all the upgrades the best computer scientists in the space believe we need.  NYA was a nice little backdoor agreement to get segwit passed but it it not healthy for the community.  The miners already split of bitcoin cash anyways.  That can be their big block expiriment.  If they want to add segwit to that they can.  The main chain should stay safe and backed by the best devs.  Splitting of to 2x is pointless and more about garzicks ego than anything else.

Businesses want money. They don't know what's good in the long run. They just want money now. They shouldn't have had any input. Bitcoin is in it's infancy if it's going to become what we hope. Letting greedy people screw it up just so it works now is so short sighted and dumb.

bitcoin price got way ahead of the horse?  segwit and lightning are just around the corner and will potentially solve both of these problems.
segwit was delayed by miners for a very long time so they could preserve an advantage in mining called ASICBOOST.  This is a conveniently forgotten tidbit  that is the main reason bitcoin development was delayed for so long.  Segwit nullifies they asicboost advantage.  For a long time people couldnt figure out why miners werent voting for segwit.  When this was found it it led to the drama we had with all these forks.
We have just now officially gotten through all the drama and now we just need to let the developers very carefully implement all the cool stuff segwit is going to allow.
RUSHING is BAD for something this first and foremost supposed to secure value.  There is a reason people trust bitcoin to hold thier value.  And its not because they just slam out untested hurried updates.
Just because everyone and their dog wants to be rich as soon as possible doesnt mean the development should be rushed.  
This is in its infancy now.  Be glad your here this early and dont expect an infant to run the 40 yard dash while pounding a beer.

Saying it's doomed to fail is a great way to have people sit on the sidelines while it quietly succeeds.  All the big money has to do is pay for it to be mined. They already spun up the fake AWS nodes.
Once it's mined more than the old chain coinbase will call it Bitcoin and all the new dumb money flowing in will buy the new bitcoin.  
Nothing in that article matters if big money wants to follow those steps.  It's a chance to take over the development of the future world currency. I think big money is gonna take that shot
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:56:09
Doesnt matter who drops out.  There is big money that will pay for the mining.  They are already spinning up nodes through AWS.  Big silent money is making this happen.  Big silent money has a plan.  All they have to do is spend a few million at most to mine the 2x chain.  Coinbase will call 2x bitcoin.  Thats all she wrote.  Whoever has planned this will start deving the 2x chain and shaping it in the way they want.  This is a take over of the potential future world currency.  Big silent money sees an opportunity and they are taking it.

@_date: 2017-11-06 22:14:24
They don't care about selling it to the community. They just want to meet the minimum requirements coinbase has to call it Bitcoin.  New money won't know the difference.  This is something we should all be taking very seriously. It's quiet big money. Not a silly attack by Chinese miners. It's sophisticated capitalist corporations trying to take over the potential future global currency.
Not much we can even do about it since coinbase has a monopoly on new money coming in.  Pretty big bummer. At this point it's like trying to change what politicians do.  Wright all the letters you want.. there's an agenda here your not stopping

@_date: 2017-11-01 03:03:40
the problem is coinbase has made language that allows them to call the 2x coin bitcoin.  they also have billions of dollars behind them and can easily afford to mine the 2x coin enough to meet the criteria of that language.
if you are familiar with greedy capitalism.  and you can imagine a chance for greedy capitalists to hijack what might be the future globabl currency.  it is not that far of a stretch to see a scenario where all the companies silently behind 2x are planning to take over its development and sell it as bitcoin.
it would basically cost a few million dollars for these companies to take over bitcoin development AND sell their version of bitcoin through the number 1 gateway for new money.
Bitcoin is the developers behind it.  Theres a scenario soon where coinbase will be calling a completely different project bitcoin and selling it to new money that dont know better.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:05:31
this is the highest leverage exchange too. up to 100x.  These arent real bitcoin being traded AND the original intention of this exchange was to not distribute bcash at all because they considered it garbage.   So most people took their coin off the exchange before the fork anyway.  Dont get your hopes up this exchange probably had the least amount of coin on it during the fork
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:12:37
How about this.  2x was never intended to be successful.  This group of assholes just got together to manipulate the market.  
At best the NYA was just an agreement to give the miners one last wild card they could use to manipluate the market. Give them the inside information that at on their command they will announce cancellation and allow them to play market reaction.
If you were around for litecoin segwit activation you might remember what they did.  A miner would say yes were doing segwit . Price would spike.  The same miner would say uhhh nevermind and the price would dump.  Being able to control such fundamental properties of the blockchain can make you a lot of money

The problem with this is... Non of those people supporting BU understood it was code built solely to keep one mining operation more profitable than the others.
Not code to progress bitcoin. There was a lot of propaganda and a lot of people that don't understand the technicals which made it easy to fall for the BU argument.

Bitcoin is not going to ever have a 95% concensus.  Litecoin is noisy useful as a test bed for bitcoin projects.  Bitcoin is going to have to do the UASF.  
It would be ideal for litecoin to also do a UASF to give us the best information on what Bitcoins hurdles will be.
I hate to say it but it's best for litecoin to also need a UASF.

Yea I think crypto is at a rubber meets the road period.  There will be a long consolidation and then whatever can fill the role of value in the future when internet of things becomes more actualized and less of a buzzword.  I know someone whos company was bought by verizon.  They engineered something for a device that will go on power polls and distribute wifi everywhere.  You will use the same internet in your house as you do driving around.  And everything will be connected through it.
As things like that role out I think crypto will begin to shine again in real actual ways.  I think this was the last hype bit before it will need to actually function better than dollar money could even manage

People need to reaize 2x is about coinbase and some other corporations taking over bitcoin. Plain and simple.  This is is really really bad and destroys the coolest part of bitcoin.  decentralization.
2x has no reason to exist other than that.  Some rich actors want to be in control of the potential new monetary system.
We are doing fine with the devs weve had.  The community needs to realize this  and support what bitcoin is or we are going to lose it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:59:40
I think people need to swallow a hard pill here and understand this is a very long term change and will go through cycles.  We just had a huge surge in price based on hype of what this technology will become. Same as in 2013.
Now there will be a bear market and a consolidation period. It will be boring and painful to most people and will probably hover around 1-3k for a long time.
Maybe even a year.  It will be a slow grind down and every single bounce will give you hope.
But in the end technology so need to catch up to the hype.
During the king flat period. Lightning, rootstock, atomic swaps, side chains, dives chains... All these new technologies segwit enabled will be explored.  And as they are explored and perfected and new ideas bloom from that experimentation.. then price will curl up again.  And we will have another boom.
But that's a long way away.  This is a technology that's attempting to replace a major part of accepted world infrastructure right now. It won't just do it instantly and it will have a lot of hype cycles along the way.
Imo if you want to set yourself and more likely you kids up really well for the future you should be saving up over the next 6 months to a year and buy as much as you can during the long rounded bottom period.  It will look just like what happened from 2013 to 2017 on the chart.  It's probably gonna be from 1-3k. Maybe 5 at most.  
Hate to break it to you.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:00:24
Honestly I think this is why this bear market is gonna last a lot longer. All the people in it for the quick buck need to be squeezed out again. Then over the course of another year or 2 consolation the technology will have more focus and innovation.
Reading crytpo forums is just ridiculous now. All these greedy idiots are not about to become rich. These are the people that lose everything when they finally sell the bottom of the consolidation phase.

2x is an attempted take over if the main chain to have control of the development of what might be the future world currency. It does not need to be done at this time and supported with such veracity by corporations like coinbase. They are doing it for a reason. They want control. Nothing more
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:11:13
Its not going to work that way this time.  Coinbase is going to call the 2x chain bitcoin.  Thats a big deal.
This is an attempted takeover of the development of bitcoin by corporations.  This is a major test in the bitcoin space.  Decentralization is really important to this whole thing.  Its about to get fucked by people that dont care.  Coinbase has billions they can throw at this to market it and play it off as bitcoin.
There is a reason all these wallet and mining companies support this even though it goes against the development strategy of the peoople who brought bitcoin to where it is today.   It is an opportune time for a hostile take over of what is potentially the the future of global currency.
This one is way more important than bcash.  That was an obvious scam.  This one is going on the major US onramp for coin
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:39:05
I keep saying this over and over.  But coinbase will control what is called bitcoin as adoption increases.  They are full bore behind 2x for only one reason and its not a benevolent expiriement to see if 2mb blocks are needed.  This is some corporate interests seeing an opportunity to take over bitcoin and going for it. 
I almost dont even see how its going to be stopped at this point.  Coinbase has all the power here as they are the only onramp that  holding hands with banks and the US government right now.  We are basically screwed already. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:24:13
2x is a method for a take over of bitcoin.  Please watch the coinbase reaction and send them emails saying you dont see why they continue to support it.

Please let them know you want to know why

Im all for big blocks in a timely and well thought out manner.  This fork was done originally to let chinese miners save face, and is now being propped up by corporations that realize it was a great opportunity for them to take over the development of bitcoin.
Coinbase will literally be able to develop this chain and call it bitcoin in their app soon.  They are a corporation and this is a great opportunity for them to gain control over what they sell.  It is very important this dies before it starts.
If it doesnt.  And coinbase calls this bitcoin.  Consider the fundamental spirit of this experiment officially over.  It will be US politics.  It will be corporate.  It will not be decentralized cypher punk money.  As the waves of mass adoption continue coinbase will have an extreme amount of power.  They will call this bitcoin, and new money will buy thier bitcoin.  And miners will mine the more profitable chain.  This is something everyone should be worried about
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:02:13
It should be biased.. One side is reasonable. The other side is filled with corruption. If you objectively state both sides its gonna come off as biased.  There is no reasonable reason for rushing out 2x.  I could completely understand an argument for letting segwit options play out and seeing what they can for 6 months to a year, then slowly formulating a plan for the inevitable block size increase along with other improvements to code base.  But just slamming it down peoples throats like this is ridiculous.  The only argument for blocksize increase now is to alleviate what happens when miners spam the network.  But 2mb blocks is not going to stop them from spamming the network so how is this even remotely a sound idea?  Its just another chance for some people to take the bitcoin name and use their own developers.  Which IMO is reallly dangerous when one of those entities is Coinbase.  They will be able to be a part of the development team AND be the only easy distributer for most people.  Mark my words.  Their end goal is to call the 2x coin bitcoin AND sell it on their app AND control its development.  That is really really really really really bad for decentralization.  And most the new money coming into this space wont understand what makes crypto strong.  The will just want the nerd money.  Most people coming into this space are your average american voter.  Coinbase is gonna give us the US politics version of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:57:00
Its more devious than that.  There is a reason coinbase is sticking to it so hardcore.  They know this is a chance.  Potentially thier only chance at completely taking over the development of the future global currency that bitcoin might be.  The only logical reason for them pursuing it is grabbing a great amount of power by forcing out the devs weve had for years and replacing them with people that will mold bitcoin into something that works for them.  These corporations that still support it only do it for one reason.  They see an opportunity.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:25:05

@_date: 2017-09-26 21:50:16
Coinbase base is hardcore in support of it. I believe they have the power to label whatever chain they want Bitcoin and the new money that doesn't know better will adopt that one.
The only reason I can see that they have unwaivering support for 2x is it's a chance for a billion dollar corporation that distributes Bitcoin to also take over it's development.  IMO it could even be more devious as coinbase also holds hands with banks and the US government very well to do all that they have accomplished.
I think 2x is going through no matter what and when coinbase calls it Bitcoin it won't matter what the original ideals behind it were. New money is dumb. The general population is dumb. The coinbase corporate coin will become bitcoin unless we step up hard right now

It has no concensus from any of the devs that have been committing to the code for the last few years. It's some corporations and miners signing a deal behind closed doors to take advantage of an opportunity to split Bitcoin off and gain control over it's direction.
It will have NONE if the best and brightest that brought us this far working on it.  That is not sound concensus.  There is no reason to rush a fork to 2mb. Right now transactions are almost free and instant.
The only time the network bogs down is during spam attacks. A 2mb block size will not stop spam attacks. The miners doing them receive the transaction fees so increasing the attack 2 fold is nothing to them.
This is a very bad step for Bitcoin to take and looks a lot like a major corporation buying out an awesome family restaurant and trying to monetize it.  Code will be written to make things easier for coinbase. Not to create the most sound decentalized system.
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:10:18
The different between 1 and 2mb blocks is arbitrary. If segwit isn't going to work we need way bigger blocks. Garzik and co. Are trying to take over Bitcoin at a time that it's vulnerable. It's not necessary. If your a billion dollar corporation like coinbase and you see an opportunity for vertical integration you do it.  In no way is coinbase listing the 2x coin good for anyone but coinbase
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:10:20
The companies like coinbase and bitpay that are using this opportunity to try a take over if bitcoin code don't want a lot of noise. Coinbase wants it to silently go through and they want to label the 2x coin as Bitcoin on their in ramp. They are THE onramp for all the new money that will be flowing into crypto and this is an amazing opportunity for them to not only be the oh ramp but also control the direction Bitcoin goes. Potentially being the most powerful entity on the planet if bitcoin becomes what many of us hope.   
This is what corporations do. They see opportunity, and they go for it. And this is an opportunity that comes once in a 100 lifetimes. 
At this point it almost seems like their is nothing we can do. Coinbase is the on ramp. New people won't understand what's happened and all the baggage. They will just buy what coinbase calls Bitcoin. Coinbase doesn't even have a competitor in the US market space. There is no way for us to boycott this. It feels like the same helplessness of US politics   it doesn't matter how many letters we wright them. They are going through with it.
If I wear a tinfoil hat I would assume the US government is probably quietly urging this along so they have a hand in bitcoin development as well.  This is probably the best chance to take over this currency any entity will ever have. There must be a reason coinbase the banks and the government are holding hands so peacefully.
I really hope in wrong. But if Bitcoin is what we all think it is than powerful groups will be trying to take it over and centralize it and corrupt it to their vision.

I hope in wrong. But I think there is a reason coinbase and the banks and the government all hold hands so nicely.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:04:36
So it is only to unify the miners with the devs?  You gave no sound technical reasons.  The miners also already made a larger block experiment.  The best devs wont be joining the 2x project so you will also be screwing up development in general.  I am really bummed to see this out of you.  2mb blocks will do nothing to help the network spam and 1mb blocks are fine now when there is no network spam.  2x does absolutely nothing but cause confusion and ostracize  bitcoins best devs.  We have segwit. We dont need a blocksize increase until its prudent and well thought out.

This is not fake news.  It will be temporary, but china does want to get crypto under more control.  They do this all the time so its not going to be something to worry about.  But they will be announcing it soon and the price will flucuate.  If your not on margin you will be fine and you should buy the dip
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:37:52
The market snowballs easily. The chart already looks bearish. So traders are waiting for confirmation we break under 4000 to continue the down trend. Goldman's has report at mid 2000s after break to new highs. Segwit 2x looming.  China scares. Lots of traders just waiting for the sign. People see Charlie's tweet and this jack as speaks all we got got sharp red candies giving a pretty solid signal to the traders waiting. They go short or close margin long and price stumbles down lower. Medium term people that maybe got in at the last consolidation in the 2000s get their alert on phone that it broke under 4k and see the slow steady decline this time will get out and be happy with profits. Price will continue like this as all of those people eventually capitulate.  Maybe China news clears up and they get the regulations they are comfortable with. Maybe some cool experiment comes out through segwit.  Maybe 2x officially dies bringing certainty and cooperation killing the idea of a corrupted Bitcoin getting legitimized.  Maybe 2x is still coming out and people want their free coin. Some bank does an ico.. those things all line up along with chart bottoming out after the last bit of panicked capitulation of late buyers cutting loses. Will be there bounce. The process will reserve and traders. New money and medium term buyers will flow in making the chart look pretty again. The news will say bitcoin is hitting new highs. There new attention will bring another new batch of buyers in thinking ok I've heard about this enough that it's not going away. Time to pay attention and the cycle repeats.
I just wanted to say this dickbag did at least make an ugly looking red candle that was part of an overall market structure and fundamental situation that wasn't great potentially pushing things along any even over a cliff that could lead to another cliff.

Actually most merchants in Amazon will want to cash out instantly. If 50000 BTC purchases go through in one day they are gonna have a hard time cashing out instantly at the price the item it's selling for.  It's definitely not ready for massive retail payments and that's ok. We are here at the start. Be happy about it.
It's more of a store of value right now because it's the very beginning. When 1 Bitcoin is worth 100k it will function much better as a currency.  Again. Be happy about that. It's fine and it can be both and always will be both unless something better comes along.

I hate to be a downer but they will be able to buy back from 1-3k during the next consolidation phase
These bounces on the way down are the same as the dips on the way up.  
I'm not saying Bitcoin won't go to 50k or whatever. But it's not immune to market cycles. At 6k people are still up 10x from a little over a year ago.  The market needs to balance out and consolidate we the technology progresses. Then the next run will happen. This straight to the Moon crap of cause people a lot of stress
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:11:18
It is very important to shut 2x down. It is leaving the best devs and going to centralized Bitcoin development around corporations and miners. We really need to start having this clear or Bitcoin will lose what makes it great.

Yea but that obsessive shizophrenic guy on Twitter said every time the price went up it was a tether conspiracy.
Not organic growth. Not cnbc becoming a crytpo network. Not everyone of your sceptical freinds finally buying. Not massive exponential increase in Google searches and subreddit subs.  It was all just one big conspiracy.  By an exchange that makes millions a day from trading fees. That thought hey you know what let's risk our highly profitable business in an exploding market to run a scam....
Bitfinexed is the Twitter handle if your curious.  Seriously every told the price moved. Even on non tether exchanges he would claim some conspiracy.
That is where all this bullshit started.  Kind of blows my mind he was taken seriously. Ironically by all the new people entering the space driving price up then believing the price rise was not due to them jumping on the train in mass.

Why call it off? Him and the corporations he partnered with will be taking their first steps to fully controlling bitcoin when it happens.  Step 2 coinbase calls 2x- bitcoin, and bitcoin - bitcoin classic.  Step 3 new money doesnt know better and buys the 2x coin.  Step 4 mining power moves to more profitable chain.  Step 5 corporate/government control of bitcoin.
This is capitalism.  Hostile take overs happen.  Coinbase controls the narrative new money will see.  
Either way the goood news price will spike hard before 2x because everyone will want their free coin.  Bad news is bitcoin as we know it will be dying
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:18:35
the only argument for 2x is the random transaction hikes.. thats why it should be highlighted what bitcoin is like when its not being spammed
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:17:21
2x will be supported by coinbase. which means new users will be very confused when they load up their coinbase app and at best see 2 bitcoins.  at worst see only the 2x bitcoin called bitcoin.
This is totally unneccecary until lightning and sidechains prove unsuccessful.  Splitting the chain before hand is really really dumb and will only confuse the market.  
The only reason for doing this is to give the poeple developing a the 2x chain a shot at taking over what might be the future of currency before the decentralization aspect becomes to powerful for corporations to corrupt.
Right now there is a reason these large corporations. Especially coinbase in my mind. Arent throwing in the towel.  They see a way to be in control of bitcoin.
There is NO reason to split the chain until its necessary.  And people should be worried when a billion dollar company is trying to push an unnececary split of the chain and is capapble of calling the one under their control bitcoin and selling on their service as bitcoin.  Be fucking very aware.
@_date: 2017-09-30 06:50:51
Coinbase is a firm supporter of 2x.  They want it to succeed because they will control its development.  I will be suprised if they dont label the 2x coin bitcoin and call the core coin btc classic.  This is their attempt at vertical integration, they will have it go smoothly.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:59:54
I just think it's important to wonder why these corporations are adamantly behind this arbitrary blocksize increase when there are easy outs to the NYA agreement when some of the miners backed bcash.
They are doing it for a reason. If I'm a billion dollar corporation like coinbase and I see an opportunity to hijack the development of the product I sell I take it. They have made the language clear. Now all they need to do is pay to have that chain mined, and they get to sell it as Bitcoin.  They can then pay developers to shape that chain however they like.
Companies like coinbase and bitpay would be happy to have a backdoor into the asset they sell and this is a perfect way for them to do it.
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:47:24
Im fine with an anti core project.  Im not fine with something so sinister to the fundamental strength of bitcoin.. decentralization.  I dont want coinbase selling AND developing bitcoin. Thats what this will be.  2x will be called bitcoin.  And bitcoin will be btc classic on their site.  Mark my words they will control how the public buys bitcoin and they are trying to take over right now 
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:41:25
The 2x fork was originally designed to allow chinese miners to save face while still voting for the segwit upgrade.
Its now being used by corporations to attempt to take over bitcoin. Namely Coinbase will be able to call whatever chain they want Bitcoin, and sell it to new money that doesnt know the difference.  At the same time this group of companies will be able to control development of that chain shaping bitcoin into what works best for them.
They are a billion dollar company and this is a great move for them to vertically integrate.  Its capitalism 101.
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:09:14
It's not even started yet.  When coinbase finds a way to call 2x Bitcoin and change the cute project to Bitcoix.  Then the game will have started.
This is real power coinbase has here. They will at some point lost their coin to new users as Bitcoin.  Money will flow there and so will everyone else
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:37:33
This is not good for price just so everyone excited realizes. It's great for Bitcoin, but most merchants will just be liquidating to fiat immediately. Eventually there will be a day this doesn't happen. But in the short term there will be a big bear market as people spend their Bitcoin and business's that don't want the risk if holding a volitile asset just cash out during the transaction
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:05:53
Its a chance for some corporations to take over bitcoin.  Coinbase is on board no matter what for a reason.  They get to control what new money sees as bitcoin.  And they can pay people to develop 2x the way they want.
They will sell the bitcoins and be controlling the development.  Who wouldnt like that business model
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:13:20
they arent going to freeze peoples bitcoin.  they will lose all thier business.  No one is gonna open an account on an exchange that might one day decide they dont like their country and take their coin. they are just saying they wont support us customers so they arent liable to us regulatory bullshit.  
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:40:50
There is a reason these busiesses wont budge.  I really hope people realize  this before its too late.  This is an attempt to take over the development and control the direction of what might be the future world currency.  This will CENTRALIZE somethings thats greatest strength is DECENTRALIZATION.  
There is only one reason at this point companies like coinbase and bitpay are holding on to the 2x plan.  It is their chance to take over bitcoin.  Coinbase is the main on ramp for new users and if they call the 2x coin bitcoin all the new money will buy it assuming its bitcoin.
This is very dangerous and I hope people start realizing whats happening here before its too late.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:10:16
You need to time things better.  At some point we will see bitcoin do a blow off top maybe around 20-30k and then pull back hard down to the 5-10k level and consolidate for a while before doing its next hard long term push up.  During that consolidation you can expect the market to get bored and fill the alts up again.  Then the process will repeat the when big daddy finishes consolidating.
IMO this is gonna happen as people fomo bitcoin for the 2x coin split.  And even continue after as most bitcoiners dump thier 2x for real bitcoin.
But then we will b back to relying on new money to push price up.  new money will be weirded out seeing more than one bitcoin on thier coinbase app and price will peeter out... and then DUMP as people in from the 1000s start cashing out at the 15-20k level.  
Price will consolidate for a while as the battle for what is bitcoin wages.  Corporations will want the 2x coin because they will be able to develop it to suit their needs.
Decentralization enthusiasts will insist bitcoin classic is the way to go.  IMO we will kinda see some real heavy western type politics in this battle.  Already the big money is silently pushing 2x for no real reason.  They just continue to silently push it forward. Expect them to buy hashrate and nodes to make it the main chain.  Then call it bitcoin on the coinbase app and the chain core develops bitcoin classic.
HUGE  split in the community will weaken bitcoin and it will need to overcome this corporate take over or have other truly decentralized coins take a lot of its market cap.  
That will be when alts explode again.
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:47:51
None of this matters if coinbase is on board.  We are basically compaining that we dont like the US government.  The power coinbase has over new adopters is the same the US government has over its citizens.  Doesnt matter how many letters we right.  The VAST majority of people coming into this space will buy whatever coinbase calls bitcoin.  They want to take over the development and vertically integrate and there is almost nothing we can do about it

This is a bounce during a down trend don't get too excited.

Yea crypto still makes me just as excited as you.  Id say only putting 100$ iIS probably pretty stupid though if you have thought through what you're feeling.  My only worry is whether technology will allow crypto to flourish before we are dead.  Right now its a lot of mist and haze around the really cool concepts of a future economy and the way it might work.  I really hope we get to see some of those things come along in the next 10-20 years.

Hes full of shit. 
Thats the margin long vs margin short data for bitfinex.. the largest most liquid usd exchange.
They have around 28k short and 28k long right now.  So if price moves down those 28k long will start feeling pressure to sell.  As price moves up those 28k short wlll feel the pressure.  But many of the shorts are just 1 for 1 hedges so they will feel less pressure
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:12:39
but the people behind this.. namely coinbase.  Will be able to control the narrative of what coin people buy.  If they calll 2x bitcoin, and what we know as bitcoin .. bitcoin classic.  they will take over bitcoin.
We are in adoption phase now, and the people behind this fork will control what new money buys.  
This is not simple hard fork based on idealogical differences.  Bcash was that.  This is some highly sophisticated big money attempting to slowly and quietly take over bitcoin.  These are western billionaires.  Not chinese miners.
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:24:26
I'll say it again in a different way. This news is based on a real rumor. I have heard from people that consult with Chinese government they will be halting exchanges.
It may or may not be bad for price. There are scenarios where people in China realize if they want their money in Bitcoin and off exchanges they need BUY bitcoin with their fiat. In fact a temporary ban on exchanges might cause a rush if would be buyers to commit in fear of not having a chance for a period of time.
Call it a rumor. Fine. But it's not fake. China has real problem in their mind with capital flight. While they want to embrace cryptocurrency they also want to ensure money isn't leaving their economy so they halt everything at times to try to get a hold on things
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:48:24
I think these large entities want the development team to change into one they control.  There is absolutely no reason for continuing this charade at this point.  If you are coinbase.  You have a billion dollar evaluation..  You have a chance to gain control of bitcoin you absolutely take it.  This is so bad for decentralization it should not be allowed.  Coinbase will be able to list the 2x coin as bitcoin and we will have serious problems.  There is a reason they are so steadfast on this.  China seems to be banning mining now on top of everything else.  The whole thing was done do appease chinese miners.  Who already broke the agreement anyway when they made bcash.
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:59:30
Why wouldn't they? Coinbase is going to call the 2x coin Bitcoin. That's the coin all new adopters will be blindly buying. This is a corporate take over of development. Of course they will win the price battle.
This is US politics. We don't get the best president. We get the one offered to us by the powers that be.
Coinbase had tremendous power at this phase of adoption. There is a reason they have undying support for 2x.  They can control its development and sell it at the same time. That's a much better business model than selling a decentalized crypto they hold no control over.
There's also not much we can do about it at this point I fear. I hope I'm wrong, but there is no other logical reason why these companies still support it other than wanting to take control.
And if coinbase calls 2x Bitcoin that is where the money is going. If money goes there that's where mining is going.  I think we are looking at potentially the end of the decentalized Bitcoin dream.  Coinbase has sooooo much power here to make a move
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:07:28
Why not support a timely well developed blocksize increase?
At this point 2x is just a shot for some corporations to develop a bitcoin chain.  If it goes well coinbase will call 2x bitcoin and the old bitcoin bitcoin classic.  They will pay people to develop their chain and they will sell their chain as bitcoin.  The fundamental beauty of bitcoin is decentralization and thats as centralized as it gets.  You support destroying bitcoin basically.  Good job!
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:27:01
If you think the real value of Bitcoin comes from purchasing day to day items you don't get cryptocurrency at all.  
That's a nice side effect.
The real value is decentalized sovereign value that will be capable of highly advanced value exchanges. 
Yes you can spend it. You will regret it if you don't buy more back on the next dip.  This is a baby technology and spending it for a coffee is the most simplistic usecase.
Just wait for smart contracts and real decentalized corporations built on the Bitcoin blockchain.  
Yes it's a currency. But that's not so it is and that's it's most simplistic use case.

Thats a bummer you had to suffer the loss from 1000 to 400.. but if its a long term investment and you can see a future where crypto is ubiquitus I think its not a bad idea to put a sizeable chunk into it.  
Do you watch your 401k every day?  Yea its gonna be volitile for a while.. thats because it cant function as a stable currency until we talk about it in satoshis.  At 100k a bitcoin in 30 years when it bobs up and down a thousand dollars it wont matter.

@_date: 2017-10-01 16:17:38
I have heard from people that were asked to sign the agreement that coinbase absolutely will not withdraw.  That is my main concern with 2x.  I believe coinbase is a billion dollar business that sees an opportunity for vertical integration.  They get to have a bitcoin with insignificant code base change and hire developers to shape it into something that works for them.. and probably the US govt.
Coinbase has ALL the power at this phase of adoption.  If they label the 2x coin bitcoin and hire devs for it that will be the coin new  money buys.  If that coins value goes up compared to bitcoin classic guess where the miners and nodes go?
It doesnt even really matter how much we protest.  Its like US government.  Coinbase has all the control of what new money does and new money is the vast majority as bitcoin ramps up its adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:22:14
You need to extrapolate more... They are a business.. and they see a chance to vertically integrate the cryptocurrency that will change the world.  They are adamntly supporting this split because its a chance for them to hire developers and backdoor develop the 2x chain PLUS be able to call the 2x chain bitcoin.  They are a billion dollar corporation.  They have an opportunity to take over the development of the product they sell.  
They can do this because the average person doesnt understand the politics behind bitcoin.  They are just now wetting their feet and in the comming years they will go to coinbase and buy whatever is called bitcoin on coinbase.  They can buy the hashing power to make it the main chain.  Then they can call it bitcoin and develop it and sell it.
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:52:58
we are going to see this beautiful decentralized anti establishment system get taken over by corporations
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:40:11
Coinbase has a billion dollar valuation.. these companies behind this have major money and would be very good business proposition to try to vertically integrate Bitcoin.  That's what this will be when coinbase labels 2x as Bitcoin. And has the core chain as Bitcoin classic or whatever. They will be paying their own developers to shape bitcoin in the way they want it and then selling it to new adopters and it will become the main Bitcoin.  
It's a business opportunity and these companies won't pass it up.  They have an excuse to execute their own chain of Bitcoin and the ability to label it however they want to new adopters on coinbase.  
And entities like coinbase that have such close ties to the US government should never get to be involved with the direction of Bitcoin like this.  They have an almost Monopoly on the way new money gets in and are somehow cozy with a lot of banks and the US government enough to have such a functioning service.  It's too likely they are corrupted by government pressures to also be developing bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:54:20

Coinbase will do the same thing. Bitcoin is still in early adoption. The new money will make the future and the new money is gonna be told 2x is Bitcoin.

WHY?  What do you think will happen when those btc are spent on amazon?  Market Sell.. Price might spike.. and then there will be a big freefall down to 1-3k and we will consolidate for years before finally pushing back up to absorb sell pressure.
Yea its cool for adoption.  But its not cool for price.
On top of that you can buy from amazon right now using purse.io.  with the added benifit of getting a 10% discount AND knowing your bitcoin are going to be hodled by someone else. Not market dumped for cash

segwit 2x is not consequence free money like bcash.  there is much more contention with this one since the developers wont support it, but wallets and coinbase will.  new people to bitcoin will download coinbase and at best they will see 2 bitoins and have to choose.  At worst they will see 2x but it will be called bitcoin and they will begin their takeover of the bitcoin network before it becomes global currency
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:34:39
If Coinbase and garzik together make a new bitcoin and call it Bitcoin through the coinbase app. And don't allow free development in it. Then consider Bitcoin taken over.

This is the start.  Be very aware the massive companies behind 2x like coinbase and bitpay are staying behind it for a reason.  They have had plenty of outs at this point to leave the NYA.  There is a reason they dont.
This is a once in a thousand year chance to take control of a currency that has a good chance of being a global next generation global standard currency.  Coinbase clearly worded how they will label the 2x coin as bitcoin.  All they have to do is buy some hashing power.  
This is a chance for a capitalist corporation to vertically integrate.  That is what they do.  This is very very very bad for an asset thats main attraction is decentralization.
There is absolutely no reason for such a small blocksize increase.  It will not stop spam.  It is not needed at this point.  
This is massive western money attempting a very nefarious and quiet take over.  This is not chinese miners throwing shit at the wall.  This is a quiet darkness that is going to slowly seep in.  
Coinbase will control what new people think is bitcoin.  It will be very hard to prevent this attack because they have so much money and have so much of an advantage as the only easy gateway in to bitcoin.

Im telling everyone now. Coinbase is and this group of corporations is attemting to take over the development of bitcoin.  This will destroy the number 1 cool idea behind bitcoin.  Decentralization.  They have billions of dollars behind them.  They can make whatever chain they want have the most hashing power.
This is capitalism.  This is a chance for corporations to vertically integrate. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:02:02
This is very different than anything before. This is billion dollar corporations looking to the future and seeing a way they can run Bitcoin.
Coinbase won't budge for a reason. They have the power to call whatever they want Bitcoin to brew adopters.  Over the coming months they will find a reason for 2x to be labeled bitcoin. And the Bitcoin we know and love will be called bitcoin classic.
This will be a slow steady powerful creep. It's sophisticated Western money trying to vertically integrate.  This isn't some Chinese miners making a big show about their new coin.  This is old white political types taking a shot at being in control of what will be the future world currency.
Coinbase will call 2x Bitcoin.  And they will pay for developers to shape it how they like.  IMO they are so friendly with banks and governments there is a chance this is a very large devious hijacking.
We can't stop it. It's a slow wall you will see come out of the fog soon.  It's like the little guy could every change US politics.
Well this is the big guys of US politics coming in to play the little guy game we have made. And they looked it and want to take it away. And have big guy ammunition.
If you're not really worried and paranoid about the power behind 2x and why they would continue to push it you need more time foil in your head

Get real. Zoom out on the weekly chart. Markets move in cycles. It's painfully obvious we need a large consolidation phase after so much hype. Technology and real use case has to catch up with the hype.  
You're really fooling yourself if you expect anything exciting with price in the next year.

Why. Segwit is an extremely elegant and amazing solution. The miners are interested in protecting asicboost.  They are against segwit for only selfish reasons.  
Windex does not ask janitors about chemical changes to the compounds in Windex.  Maybe the shape of the bottle.  This is letting greedy miners who are only interested in maximizing their profits effect something that should stay as pure as possible as long as possible.
On top of that I'm guessing if the miners weren't spamming the network the issue would not even exist.  
It has been proven beyond doubt the miners care about their profits over the long term strength of Bitcoin.  They should really not have a say and it's a shame it became so centralized

bitcoin has had a group of devs working on it for a long time.  they do not think its a good idea to do the 2x fork.  Its kind of rushed and irresponsible for a hardfork.  they have all said they will not contribute to this new chain.
however.. companies like coinbase are very adamant in their support for the fork even though its not needed any more.
IMO these large comanies see an opportunity to hire their own devs and take over the developent of this new bitcoin chain.
Coinbase is also the major onramp of new money into this space.  If they choose they can call the 2x chain - bitcoin and sell it as the true bitcoin.  they will probable call the chain with the devs that got us this far bitcoin classic.
Its a really transparent power grab at this point.  There is no argument for rushing a 2mb block increase like this.  Maybe when we were having trouble getting segwit through and the chinese needed to save face. But thats over now.  they created bcash for a big block experiment which is a good enough out to call off 2x.
The ONLY reason it would still be backed by these monster companies is they see a chance to vertically integrate. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:14:43
the short version is the core developers of the bitcoin we know and love want segwit to begin to safely scale bitcoin without doing anything to drastic.
the miners dont like this because it will reduce the amount of money they make.  on top of that 1 specific miner, Jihan, had hidden code in his miners called asicboost that gave him an extras special advantage.  segwit will nullify that advantage aswell.
since a lot of money is on the line they basically pay to have a lot of confusion spread about why a very simplistic  hard fork of bitcoin would be better.  they called it bitcoin unlimited and it has had catastrophic failures on the test net already.  
In short.  Segwit is a slow steady improvement for bitcoin that is a really good solution and doesnt require a hard fork.  
A contentious hard fork would lead to 2 bitcoins and that would probably make newbs even more confused.
segwit is already active and working on other coins.  the only reason not to activate it on bitcoin is greed.

more people need to realize this. the majority who appose segwit are those profiting highly from these fees and have technology that only gives them an advantage if segwit isnt activated. read up on asicboost.
everyone else is kind of parroting the propaganda this small group of miners is astroturfing.
the asicboost thing was only just found out and is kind of undeniable proof the delay is happening for greed and not concern for bitcoins future

You should be selling to let the people responsible for this fiasco know it's unacceptable.
This all started because the miners didn't want to activate segwit. Purely out of greed. They to maximize transaction fees so they spam the network. A lead collaborator of 2x, jihan, had asicboost that have him alone a major advantage he wanted to keep as long as possible. He is ok with 2x for a reason. 
This is all due to miners greed. We should have had segwit and lightning transactions a long time ago. Now we are losing the best devs and compromising with greed.  This is bad and is not acceptable.
Tell them by selling your bitcoin. When the forks happen buy the chain that is preserving the ideal and principles of Bitcoin.
Seriously if you're new to Bitcoin read up on the history of segwit and jihan for the past years.  Then ask yourself why this greedy untrustworthy human is worth compromising with now. What is hidden around the corner. Just read up on asicboost and how long he has screwed over Bitcoin for his own profit.

You do realize anyone can make Fork of bitcoin at any time. These shoes not supporting it is only a hint at how seriously anyone should take it. If they drop everything and create new code to support every random fork crap coin that's created from bitcoin it will be a major headache.
Not supporting this coin is a good thing. It makes it clear what this coin is. A valueless proposition. It's website is a template from wix and it's got no decent devs. It shouldn't be given the light of day. Same as any random fork you or I do when we are free one weekend

The devs the understand the power of decentralization will move to another coin.  Bitcoin will probably keep dying like today for a while because most of the old big money in bitcoin was in it for the principle of it.  Now that its bowing to centralized control they will leave too.  Some new coin will come along that has the best devs from bitcoin and all that money will move there.
The peope into this that bought thousands of coins in the early days did it because they saw the power in the ideology behind the project.  They will move somewhere else.. They are in the process today you can see it in the chart now that we are realizing just how corporate segwit2x is

You won't. Everyone and their dog will dump this coin before you. Asm yourself how much you would sell you bcc for a quick buck?.. if I have 10 BTC I'd be tempted to sell it all the way down to 10$.

The futures value for coin is usually really exaggerated. I will be surprised if you get more than 100$. In fact here is a test. Would you sell this crap coin for 100$? If yes then you won't get 100$ for it. I'm guessing most people will sell their all the way down to 10 or 20 dollars. People with way more Bitcoin than you will do this way faster than you can. There is nothing special about this coin. It's essentially going to have no devs from bitcoin and be exactly what the bitcoin devs thought was the incorrect step for BTC to take. Mark my words 10-20 bucks per coin is all most we be getting for this effort. Everyone is going to be dumping this as fast as they can.  
On top of that. A mass Exodus from exchanges that don't support every crap bitcoin fork that comes along is probably the goal for jihan here. It will likely fuck up more than one exchange and make Bitcoin price dump. If everyone took their BTC off Polo I'm guessing they will have some problems.  Maybe take them out of coinbase is fine.

That's not what dug litecoin it off it's grave. I played the litecoin segwit move it went up massively at that time.

Now the people at the helm are demonstrating all kinds of ineptitude and youre patting them on the back?? jesus fuck.. if bitcoin has just one fatal fuckup its done.  crypto will be pushed back years.  We should be only pushing segwit right now and doing the fork when the decent devs think its time. Not when the miners want.

Segwit is a a software upgrade to Bitcoin. It would allow the scaling of Bitcoin without having do a hard fork of the bitcoin chain. The main developers think unnecessary hard forks are bad and want to include many different upgrades when they do one.
Segwit was an amazing solution to this problem, but would compromise an advantage one major mining cartel had called asicboost.  This advantage was hidden for a long time and it was not known why they were anti segwit.  Massive legions of paid Reddit posters flooded r/BTC for Long time convincing many people that were not tech savvy the miners were underdogs and simply knew better than the devs what the path of Bitcoin should be. IE no segwit and immediate hard fork to unlimited blocks or larger blocks or a few other simplistic solutions that usually failed on test net.
A few months ago it was realized the previously mentioned mining cartel had a hidden advantage in mining known as asicboost.. It cleared the air and made it obvious the reason they were blocking segwit. This advantage would go away with segwit and all the hardware he produced would no longer have it's advantage.
He essentially stalled the progress of Bitcoin in order to make more money.
So many people got confused over this mess and devoted to an unneccary blocksize increase that segwit2x was born as a compromise/ face saving deal for the miners so they don't look like they gave in.
It's pretty interesting and I think most people don't understand the complex political history here.  If you could read r/BTC at times it really looked like a weird propaganda subreddit with massive amounts of similar posts with no content making it look like the miners naive solution had support.  Very interesting history to this that goes back a long way.

If bitcoin doesnt maintain its vision of decentralization that it will lose the devs that had passion for it for that reason.  They arent just going to hang around and be bossed around by greedy chinese miners when they can just start a new project they get to control the beauty of.

Get a job and wait for this current bubble to resolve itself. Then find projects you like and invest.  There are very few cryptos that if people just invested the money they were going to put into mining directly in the coin that would have made mining worth it.
Mine if you want for fun. But 1000 in Bitcoin might go 10x in a few years. That amount into a mining rig  for Bitcoin will not.  Even if you mine a cheaper coin it's historically worked out better for the invester than the miner. 
Work hard for a year and wait for the current prices to consolidate and continue the move up. Or more likely dip considerably​ then consolidate. 
Find something you're passionate about. What draws you to crypto?  I guess if you're a very tech person you might like mining but it's mostly sitting around. 
Most the advice here is from get rich quick guys so you can tell we are nearing the end of this bubble.  Don't get caught holding the bag of greedy people. Save cash for the next few months and see how this is playing out. The majority of coins out now are scams.  This entire space will have a cleansing soon. Too much greed and every idiot thinking they can print free money.

Maybe a company will develop a smart box for verified sells. You put your Rolex in the box. It's weighed and analyzed. Some verified jewelry specialist can be called upon. The buyer can view it. Whatever the terms we're. If all terms are met the buyer is sent a code. When he unlocks the box your funds are sent to you. The box maker gets some small fee. The verified Jewelers or whoever can make a small fee. And hopefully the lawyers will be cut out as they charge the most for doing the least.
I think a lot of this will depend on technology coming down the tubes that might be able to analyze your Rolex for gold and mineral content. Not necessarily happening in the next year.

This will dump very hard very fast. People with major amounts of BTC will dump it faster than you can and I will be surprised if you make up the transaction fees for just moving your bitcoin of exchange to get these coin.  Value will be 1-5 bucks per con within hours

he takes a really easy cynical position. reminds me of pompous people calling internet useless in the 90s.  easy thing to say and get a pat on the back
its the wildwest now, but this value share method is superior to stocks and money. an awesome future if these assholes dont regulate it into another stockmarket

It will just take one or two banking crises.. Or a president fucking up the country so bad the dollar goes way down.. War maybe.. Lack of institutional faith at a global level.. Its not too hard to believe.  Unfortunately it will probably take some pain in other world systems as they fail.  Trump really just has to make one grave mistake for a flee into gold and bitcoin.

Its hard to argue with the logorithmic chart dude.  Its literal math staring you in the face at the top of this post.

This is the ultimate correct answer and what all the new people who weren't around to see these miners completely fuck bitcoins progress the last few years should research... It's just a group of miners that want to maximize profit by stalling the development of bitcoin as long as possible and propose poorly thought out alternatives to what the main developers want and then blanket the r/BTC sub with paid spam saying it's the correct solutions and your stupid of you don't agree..
There's so much history to this that it's hard to understand but the main red herring is asicboost

Vitalik has already said he doenst advise or endorse any of you assholes.  You are ruining this space right now with your greed.  You had a 5 minute phone call with him once on the technicals of a smart contract doesnt mean he endorses your scam.

they did t it with litecoin.  they short the market then release some negatie news.. then cover thier short.. go long and renig on the news.  the chinese miners ONLY care about making money. not the health of the ecosystem

exersice and build some hobbies you enjoy.  dont try to show off for girls.  the ones that stick around when your nothing extra really love you.  congrats dude.  I'd personally diversify into a few other cryptos and put them on loan and live off the interest.  Im a crypto believer though. IMO in ten to twenty years the crypto market will take over the stock market

This is absolutely necessary to move forward and we need to get gateways like coinbase on board.

you can put your bitcoin chart to logorithmic and you will see a better visual of what OP is saying..   This run is just getting started in log.

because 100s of millions of people are agreeing its the logical evolution of value store.  we went digital. why wouldnt we make a better form of money? 
On top of that there are a lot of methods for "backing" cryptocurrencies with assets or corporate equity.
crypto is the future of storing and transferring value.  you can peg it to anything or let its network effect stand on its own.
