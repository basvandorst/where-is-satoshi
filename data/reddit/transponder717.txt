More like:  So they have a place to buy bitcoin.
Coinbase is awesome!  So funny to listen to people whining about Coinbase...  Public service message:  Hey folks, did you know you can buy/sell Bitcoin at zero cost via Coinbase Exchange?
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:52:12
Coinbase is awesome.  Honestly, you should stop whining, as they are among the very best Bitcoin businesses in the world.  If you would like to see some particular change, you should let them know about it.  (Note:  You do not immediately get everything in the world that you want.)

Agreed.  Coinbase has been absolutely awesome/perfect execution for me as well.

Sounds like a bad credit union.  Care to share which one it was?
@_date: 2014-07-31 07:18:12
I think Bitcoin is falling right now because of the increased risk of regulation (for example New York state and European Union).
"... the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, will be pursuing restrictive Bitcoin legislation."
Personally, I think the world is just getting started in regulating the shit out of Bitcoin.  Makes me sad.
(I currently hold no Bitcoin.  Will wait and see if Bitcoin can survive this.)

Hello DeepSpace9er,
It sounds to me like your issue could be the same as this issue currently discussed near the top of the Bitcoin subreddit (under hot topics):
Users of Bitcoin Core on Linux must not upgrade to the latest version of OpenSSL
"If you are affected, then your client might become stuck at a particular block, and you'll have to reindex the block chain to fix it."
So, it sounds like there may be a workaround this issue.  And, at any rate, a fix for this issue also appears imminent with the next day or so.  Good luck to you.

Let's try to "urgently" send money via a business bank account on New Year's Eve and then whine (on Twitter and Reddit) when it is blocked and Coinbase does not immediately reply.  Honestly, dude, you just sound dumb.
@_date: 2016-01-07 08:51:20
Well done.  : )
@_date: 2016-01-07 08:19:22
Check all the headlines regarding falling yuan right now.
If you were Chinese, would you want to keep your money in a falling yuan or else move it elsewhere?
Hint:  Bitcoin is used both for moving money and as a store of value itself, among other things.

Stupid overreaction to Greece news.  Bitcoin will be fine.
(Who was buying Bitcoin on Grexit fears only?)
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:59:24
Bad news came from China, and then panic ensued.  This is actually very typically for highly speculative commodities.
Sit back and enjoy the ride.  (This has happened many times before with BTC.  And so far, it has always snapped back to set new all-time highs.)
Btw:  Why would you invest your all of your money in a single highly speculative and volatile commodity, unless you were truly willing to risk it?  You clearly haven't thought through and fully understood and accepted your longterm strategy.
Anyway:  For what it's worth, if you hold tight now, you should be fine longterm.  Whatever you do, *do not sell  now*, as this is a relative bottom at this time.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:56:07
That's a heartbreaking story, my friend.  I feel very, very sorry for you.  But hang in there.  Try not to take it too hard.  Everything happens for a reason...
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:13:53
$.25 is nothing!  If you're worried about $.25 for *any* transaction, then you shouldn't be buying whatever it was you were buying.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:09:13
It's not a bubble.  It will come back to set a new all-time high in the not-too-distant future.
(A bubble is something that permanently pops, such as the price of tulips during the tulip mania.)
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:08:57
Have you ever considered the possibility that some people in China probably had inside information on the news that was to come?
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:12:29
Do you think the Internet is a bubble?  Surely, the number of Internet users could not increase every year for decades...  Oh, wait...
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:47:26
Exactly.  And that is precisely why it will never even get as low as $300, imo.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:16:18
You're welcome.  $685 now.  Good luck buying BTC cheaper than $542.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:12:31
Funny how you are asking for your money back precisely when Bitcoin is hitting a new all-time high with a gigantic spike in price and volume.  : )
Face it, you made a mistake.
P.S.  I am quite sure you are never getting your money back, so you may as well forget about it.  (That is life.)  
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:06:35
Why in the world would you want to spend them???
If you are spending BTC, you are crazy.
Have you been watching the charts lately?
(I am furious because I cannot buy them!)
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:23:52
Newsflash for some of you:  Only a tiny fraction of people on the Earth have bought BTC, let alone know what it is.  So, this talk about the speculative frenzy being over is highly, highly premature.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:51:28
I can post whatever I want, as long as it's within the TOS.  If you don't like it, don't read it, and don't reply.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:06:27
I think it's done for now.  $542 was likely the bottom, imo.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:00:45
Sorry, the bottom is already in.  You waited a little too long to panic from the rooftops anyway.  LOL...
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:24:44
I think you misunderstood his meaning.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:27:24
It's just a minor correction, you doofus.  (Happens for every single stock/commodity, even when it's moving up.)
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:07:23
You didn't follow the recommended buying procedure on LocalBitcoins.  That is why you got burned.  Next time, follow the recommended procedure to guarantee you will not get burned.  
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:30:03
Did it ever occur to you that I might be a new reddit user, rather than a career reddit user?  Clown.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:27:10
No worries.  You made a great buy, buddy.  Hold tight.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:41:48
It's not going to drop to $200.  But nice analysis anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:29:26
I just had another guy on localbitcoins say:  "OK, I'll sell to you."  But no confirmation on time or place.  (And not responding to email or phone.)  This is the problem with localbitcoins.  In a stable or falling market sellers want to sell; in a rising market, sellers don't really want to sell.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:46:31
LOL.  Absolutely not.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:56:04
No.  btcchina is considered a virtual commodity exchange and can continue to function normally.
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:58:02
I have been nice.  Various others have made ill-informed comments.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:12:05
Fake/dumb headline.  No thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:51:46
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:56:52
Will not crash, as Bitcoin serves an underlying purpose as an electronic medium of exchange.  Any selloff in Bitcoin will be met with rushed buying at lower prices. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:30:21
My event horizon is longer than 5 minutes.
P.S.  Fwiw:  Back up to $626 at the moment.
xudevoli will be fine if he holds for the longterm.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:20:27
That's a bit strong.  No worries.  BTC will be fine.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:15:39
Excellent post.  Well said, my friend.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:32:25
LOL!  Good one.  : )
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:31:43
I've tried that (as I've said), but so far, no sellers appear to be serious about selling.  No serious responses back from sellers.
@_date: 2013-11-17 09:56:17
Thanks, buddy!  I definitely don't blame the community.  I blame our antiquated money transfer systems.
Btw:  Just to clarify regarding localbitcoins.com:  I have been unable to find a seller who actually wants to sell right now.  (They just don't reply or they have some reason they are currently unavailable.)  But this is probably due to the fact that Bitcoin is going up in value like crazy every day.  (i.e., Nobody really wants to sell something today when they think they can probably sell it for more tomorrow or next week, etc.) 
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:18:56
Actually, it only rises in value when people BUY it by paying the ask price on the exchanges.
However, more people buying more things with Bitcoin stimulates the Bitcoin economy and causes more people to buy Bitcoin on the exchanges.
Holding Bitcoin is also beneficial to the price, as opposed to selling it at the bid price which lowers the price on the exchanges.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:16:08
Yep, Bitcoin is a bubble, just like the Internet...
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:50:40
Very simple:  If you only have ~$2000 in your bank account, you shouldn't be buying any Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:17:19
You are such an idiot.  A single-day panic is meaningless to Bitcoin holders.  Hopefully, you will stay away from Bitcoin, if it doesn't interest you.  We are very tired of people like you.  Bye!
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:51:03
Don't sell. This is the worst possible time to sell.  Hold tight.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:05:16
Don't sell.  You took a risk in buying at $720 (which you should not have taken if you could not afford the risk).  Now just hold steady for the longterm.
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:57:30
Completely agree.  Well said.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:19:56
Banks didn't ban banks from using Bitcoin in China.  The government did.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:55:07
If you check your bank account balance, you will see that the money has likely already been taken from your  account.  When you buy, the money is debited immediately, but your Bitcoins are delivered several days later.  
P.S.  Btw:  No need to panic.  Just hold your BTC for the longterm.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:30:46
$1000 is the new base, imo.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:57:32
No, BTC is not a bubble.  A bubble is something that goes up dramatically in price beyond all reasonable value, and then suddenly crashes when nobody is willing or able to pay for it at those astronomical price levels any longer.  I really don't see that future for BTC anytime in the near future.  This is why all predictions of total crash/collapse for Bitcoin have failed so far.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:23:51
You are totally wrong.
Bitcoin does most certainly provide completely new capability:  a means of instantaneously sending money at no cost (and anonymously, if desired) anywhere on Earth.
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:22:51
This is stupid.  You should not be buying BTC if you have such a low bank account balance.  Get a job and build up a real bank account balance before you buy stuff you can't afford, and stop whining about how Coinbase did you wrong, when you f*cked up and didn't have the money in your account to cover it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:07:54
You can only buy tiny amounts of BTC that way initially.  Otherwise, you have to wait longer for your account to allow you to buy larger amounts.  So, interestingly, this is just another example of being blocked when I want to buy Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:39:49
just fyi:  btcchina currently 6000, not 4800.
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:54:14
I think U.S. economic recession/depression would be bad for bitcoin for one simple reason:  People who lose their jobs typically need all the cash they can get simply to survive.  Thus, they will tend to sell their assets, bitcoin included.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:15:27
You are incorrect.  btcchina is currently 5200, was previously around 7000.
