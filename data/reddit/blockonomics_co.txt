Sad to see them shutdown.  They were one of the few social channels giving coverage to less known bitcoin companies. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 09:53:04
We recently introduced this feature. It secure and easy to use.  
@_date: 2016-04-26 05:55:44
Now thatz innovation !
@_date: 2016-04-26 05:54:56
Awesome !!
@_date: 2016-04-14 04:50:34
- The time estimate 17minutes is given for only one confirmation
- We internally use bitcoinfees API for this. So the estimated times are based on how much time transactions of given fee/size took  to confirm in the last 3hours.  
@_date: 2016-04-21 04:34:16
What a revelation ! So these are the ppl trying to keep low block sizes.

B-WAP seems like a cheap looking imitation of tradeblock
Transaction Receipt Gave me Error: Could not find transaction with ID ade85ce68137255b63c08980c2cbf90573ec41f853a70c52a852a1888cfc55a7.   
FYI: tx receipts UI already exists in blockonomics. Try [this.]( 
Seems like they did a bad job copying both services
@_date: 2016-04-21 06:29:42
with block reward diminishing ... it would be easy to bribe miners to support mining costs. With larger blocks ... tx fees can support the mining costs.
@_date: 2016-04-14 08:24:41
Good suggestion. I was thinking "Estimated Confirmation Time for 1st Block", was having difficulty in putting it in simple terms. 
Estimated 1st Confirmation Time looks good, would general people understand this ? Let me know if you have any other suggestions

Hi good post. You may want to add some info from here  as to why we reallly need a mempool ?

Very good writeup.  What are your thoughts on how a bitcoin application can remain decentralized and generated profits. Non decentralized are scorned  upon in bitcoin community (especially on reddit). A case being blockchain.info. I am not sure if any of the decentralized wallets like electrum, mycelium have a profitable model.  It remains to be seen how many of these so called blockchain startups will be profitable or even stay afloat.

I am not sure why, but the maxmempool setting is much more significant. The TX is more likely to go out of mempool due to other higher fee TX rather than expiry.  Even then it really never leaves the whole network, it takes weeks/months since different nodes have different mempool settings and wallet also rebroadcasts the TX.
@_date: 2018-09-15 07:29:34
Yes, you do raise very valid concerns. While, we can't help but to trust hardware. The code must be open source and we should be able to trust that the seed words are unique and generated when the device is first initialized.

Great job by Nicolas Dorier and the bitcoin community in developing a truly decentralized solution for accepting bitcoin payments.   
I am not sure why an anti payment processor / corporation rhetoric is needed!   
Both can exist and there are other companies providing services that are useful to people. Here is a [brief list](  This also includes  [btcpay server hosts]( that help merchants get onboard that don't want to take the hassle of going through installation process

Totally agreed with this - Majority of network is exchanges / merchants. Noone is going to show two QR code or two addresses and are going safe with P2SH addresses. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:52:34
Definetly ! Electrum has done a nice thing by generating *bc1* addresses by default.
If you are a merchant,  you can show both *bc1* and traditional address coz most wallet don't recognize bc1 yet. [More Information]( We have to push for more wallets to adopt *bech32* addresses

Great job naomi ! Nice to have to you associated with bitcoin !
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:38:04
The decentralized rhetoric is all good, but I would like to point out few things about this solution:
* Security: You control your own private keys, payment go directly to HD wallet (no payment forwarding) and blockonomics never asks for any private keys
* Privacy: All order/product information is private to your server. Blockonomics does know the txid/bitcoin addresses /bitcoin amounts which are public on the blockchain.
* Setup time: Takes 5 minutes, need to register and enter wallet xpub
If you are comfortable with seting up a bitcoin node... go for solutions like BTCPay .. or even electrumx server. The are decentralized and give you more control/privacy. However, if don't have time/technical know-how there are such solutions available !
 
@_date: 2018-08-28 18:45:58
Totally agreed ! Seems like we are sending a spacecraft to mars

The simplicity of the infographic is amazing, good work here !   
One simple thing doesn't work out :  
  
No of transactions per day  = constant (due to block size limit)  
Number of bitcoins in circulation -&gt; increasing (due to mining)  
  
Why  price is not falling ? By now we should be below 300. Block size issue has remained for last year

Cool !  Actually you don't need to have ownership of addresses to see the their balance in blockonomics. Since its an address watcher you can add any public addresses. You can just add a few ones having high balance and show off !

Why don't do try add a [donation button using blockonomics]( Doesn't require any KYC/DOCs
@_date: 2018-10-22 13:51:14
Yes. you are right. Bitcoin is not good choice for POS or in person transaction.
It is always advised to only *trust* confirmed transaction
However, you can take a risk to trust unconfirmed tx for transaction of small amounts like less than 25USD. Double spending has lots of variables and its very unlikely that attacker would try to spend effort forging a low value payment

Good suggestion. Makes sense, We will push out this update this week.
@_date: 2016-06-22 17:06:00
wallet watcher - your email address is only required for email notifications, try guest login, or you can do search and it works like a blockexplorer.   
Invoice - As written in the medium post, the details are encrypted on browser, before submitting, so the server doesn't know your details.  You can ofcourse use your bitcoin address offline, which is the safest way. With invoices you just get better ability of tracking payments.
@_date: 2019-11-01 05:47:37


Good that they show this warning! I am sure non advanced users will  not understand the full implications of this and there is a high chance of losing funds due to disk failure/just power loss. Lightning support be only enabled through command line unless this is fully resolved.

Nice project. I would like to use this, but not working. Tried  
select count(*) from block  
Gave me error No column name was specified for column 1 of '__UNPAGED_RESULT'. 
Few more suggestions  
* Would be good to have some example queries
* Also I see you haven't indexed addresses, would be good to support queries like find address with largest number of bitcoins
@_date: 2017-01-16 04:05:25
awesome !
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:52:24
Nice to see you accepting bitcoin. Also invite you to try [blockonomics wordpress plugin]( The advantage over GoCoin is that payment will go directly to your HD wallet without any intermediate hops. This allows for more secure and faster payments.
Feel free to PM me if you have any questions
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:09:07
Respect !

blockonomics has a [highly rated]( plugin on wordpress through which you can accept payments directly to your HD wallet.
If you want to implement extra logic, you can use electrum as a wallet and  trigger send commands upon receiving callbacks
Feel to email webmaster at blockonomics.co if you need any further information 
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:36:19
Existing transactions are still supported. After activation,  wallet supporting segwit can take advantage of segwit features by creating segwit format transactions that will be accepted by miners/nodes into blocks.
@_date: 2017-01-24 05:54:16
Just spreading the word about the awesome tool developed by learnmebitcoin.com. Quoting from [bitcointalk thread](
* [Memory Pool]( - See the latest transactions, and which ones have been selected for inclusion in a candidate block (hovering over a transaction tells you the fee per byte, which is the metric used to determine which transactions are selected).
* [Candidate Block]( - This is actually trying to be mined on to the blockchain. It refreshes every 20 seconds to include the transactions with the highest fees. (The lowest fee-per-byte transactions tend to be at the bottom of the block, so by hovering over the bottom one, you can work out the minimum fee-per-byte needed to be included in the next block in the blockchain.)
@_date: 2019-11-04 15:09:04
Feel free to also look at [blockonomics]( which shows estimated confirmation time. It is also linked to [mempool.space]( which show the expected block your tx will confirm in
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:38:05
Nice one! But the graphs make it very difficult to find this out. If the website would be more user friendly, that would help.
@_date: 2016-06-27 04:59:09

In fact, we are encouraging you to use your own BTC wallet.
* Only thing we are providing is merchant dashboard / API , which makes it easily to accept bitcoins on your website.
* As mentioned in the article, payments go directly into  your own wallet
* All BIP32 compatible HD wallets are supported
* In addition we have encrypted invoices/ ability to generate addresses (without opening wallet) , tx history export, mail notifications and other useful features.
@_date: 2016-12-16 07:00:01
I think the premise of the service is that receiver  is a bitcoin newbie. If you are asking him to create a bitcoin wallet to withdraw funds, its pointless as then ... I could send him bitcoin directly bypassing your service.  Your service makes sense if you host a web bitcoin wallet like coinbase, from where receiver can access his bitcoin and then make purchases from there directly.   
It would have been refreshing to see it done decentralized way with nlocktime to refund and private key generated on browser.  A semi centralized  solution with ownership of private keys doesn't make sense. Better you go centralized the whole way. 
Nice logo by the way !

Thanks a lot and great job helping the community in this effort !
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:38:30
This is why you should never accept zero confirmations. Some payment processors will allow you to accept zero conf payment if fee/tx propagation is high.
Bitcoin is known to be not good for in person payments. Its good for E-Commerce, the order is confirmed for the customer and he can leave the website. But is delivered only after payment gets confirmed. 
@_date: 2019-08-24 06:48:16
There are still bunch of [alternatives]( including [Blockonomics]( that don't require KYC
@_date: 2016-11-18 15:35:50
Thanks for responding. I saw this as well   
I understand normal users not using a complex paraphrase, but can we give an option to advanced users to encrypt wallet using paraphrase. I don't know mycelium is different, multibit and other major wallets do this.
@_date: 2019-10-31 12:21:27
Great to hear you spreading word about how businesses can adopt BTC. Feel free to also have a look at [blockonomics]( It is probably the easiest one to setup for Wordpress
@_date: 2019-10-23 11:12:30
Not correct. BTC had paper wallet private key backups from day one. Even if you goto an island and come back after years, you can still recover your funds from an offline private key
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:58:20
With electrum release too, the [backup process - tweet]( is very concerning. Without a simple recovery process using seed words, it is really not safe to keep funds.   
While we haven't heard back from electrum on the above tweet, I believe they are doing encrypted backup and uploading to cloud storage. Not sure how that may not cause an old state - like in case of power outage for OP
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:38:04
Here is a [list of bitpay alternatives](
@_date: 2019-10-23 11:17:12
To accept BTC donations, one can just show QR code or just show unique address on checkout. It is not all at necessary to use any third party.

Swapping fee with amnt is a UI/UX issue. Ppl could still send 10,000 USD instead of 1000 via paypal also.
The issue with LN here isn't about UI. It is about fundamentally how it is designed which doesn't yield very well to offline backups that can recover funds.
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:32:39
Here is the process in brief  . You need a bit of work without a computer
@_date: 2019-02-20 09:44:23
Some payment gateways like [Blockonomics]( support all wallets like blockchain.info, trezor, ledger.   
@_date: 2019-06-18 13:01:19
Thanks for creating this. Unfortunately wallets like ledger, [exodus]( are still not following [BIP84]( and generating xpub in wrong format creating derivation issue.
We also created [this article]( on how to get xpub from ledger and convert it into correct format . I have reached out to ledger multiple times to fix this, but unfortunately its not on their priority list
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:05:41
Here is what I would suggest:
- Setup a woocommerce store. Add your games as product
- Provide different payment options. You can use [blockonomics]( for bitcoin
- You can change the [email template]( to send product keys/anything else on completion of order
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:12:49
Is safe unless you give out any of your private keys  .
This is more to do with privacy  that anyone having xpub can easily view balance of all your addreses present/future
@_date: 2015-08-31 21:29:11
lol ... too good ...

Great explanation and great project. You cannot overdesign the system to be resistant against attacks from US government.  
CoinJoin-initiators don't take the cheapest offer, they take a random offer weighted by price. I think this is very good, but it is possible to have a deposit fees for a entity to participate in coinjoin. If he commits to coinjoin and then withdraws, the system should take that fees. This way deploying large number of coinjoin bots would be costly.  Or is there something else that is stopping me from deploying large number of coinjoin bots ?

Very well said.   
**When fees are High**  
LN is touted as solution for micropayments, storing large amount of funds on LN is a known risk. When fees are high, noone is going to pay 5USD to open channels in the first place to do microtransactions. 
**When fees are low**  
LN works. In fact Bitcoin works better, no to stay online and worry about channel backups/routes
Only usecase I see for LN, is sending 1-10 satoshi when fee is low.

@_date: 2015-07-29 10:26:50
Isn't age of inputs a factor too ...have u excluded high priority tx from your simulation
 say
50,000 bytes in the block are set aside for the highest-priority transactions, regardless of transaction fee. Transactions are added highest-priority-first to this section of the block. Then transactions that pay a fee of at least 0.00001 BTC/kb are added to the block, highest-fee-per-kilobyte transactions first. 
Is this still being followed by current mining pools ?

Nice implementation and idea. I have one important question about sharing this over email. If I share my moneypacket your email with another person, how does that person know that I won't spend the money using the private key ... how is this supposed to work  ...?

Great job . Hats off to you and the community.   
Can you explain how the new consesus rules fixes this ? Is it effectively forcing the miner to have a non empty block. what happens in case of segwit when we have only coinbase tx  with only wtxid as 0x0000....0000
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:58:28

Thanks for the feedback. Point noted about non safety of uncencrypted email service. 
We understand that no web service can be in theoretical sense decentralized. We use it in the context that we are not storing your bitcoin/private keys like other centralized services do. Will look into rephrasing that.

You can read account discovery in  . Most tools/wallets will use gap limit of 20. So if it encounters 20 successive addresses with no tx , it will stop further discovery.

Good job ! What are the plans of opensourcing this? I don't see a reason why anyone should trust this, when all major bitcoin android wallets are open source.
@_date: 2018-11-17 17:27:58
Bitcoin client connected to internet shouldn't be handling anything greater than 1BTC. If it was so easy , wonder why so many exchange got hacked. Most of exchange were also using bitcoin clients and weren't as stupid as you thing.
Offline / hardware wallets are necessary for any serious money. Anything online will get hacked eventually ! Time and again we have seen this. Being online expose risk of private key getting hacked. The hack may not come through the bitcoin client. The key being there on the server itself is a risk

@_date: 2019-01-16 06:04:28
- 10USD each from 10,000 users makes it 100,000 USD in custody.
- It makes it easy target for hacker, because  private keys in lightning network have to be always online. Also a lucrative target like exchanges, which atleast have some cold storage 
- Some of these hacks are done by company employees themselves before they are later passed off as a theft
Think before you promote a custodial solution! Later you maybe party responsible for people getting *mtxgoxed*
@_date: 2016-09-26 06:57:45
You could try [blockonomics]( The invoices are [peer to peer encrypted]( and doesn't require any personal detail.

- HD wallet are easier to recover and maintain rather than backing up thousand of keys.

- Once you have HD wallet you can easily use hardware wallets that are the safer to store your funds.

Amount is money is not the criteria. The point is about avoid centralized risk services and promoting a culture of using non custodial wallets. Custodial/ Web wallets are 10 times more easy to use and easy gain viral traction if promoted(Ref: Blockchain.com). Every web wallet starts small and is supposed to hold only 1USD until it doesn't !

@_date: 2019-01-16 09:20:19
BTCPay already provides the same API. You can also consider [other alternatives]( like Blockonomics, OpenNode, Globee. As for conversion to fiat at locked rate, their are several alternatives:
-  Send directly to exchange and trigger sell to USD/stablecoin. Simple API call. We also have a [forwarding service]( for this
- Use something like Abra that provides non custodial fiat locking
- Several BTCPay merchants are already doing this. Maybe can help.

Just curious about this. What happens to new nodes that join the network ? When these nodes try to fetch initial blocks , some of the peers that have 'pruned blockchain' will fail to give a block. So will this slow down download for new peers ?
What is the recommended way for new node to enter the network . Can they say directly jump in start syncing from say block 240000 ?
@_date: 2018-07-25 17:51:23
This is very relevant. There are actually thousands of webhosting platforms accepting bitcoin. Also 90% of them are based on Linux/Ubuntu.
I feel sticking to C# is hampering adoption of BtcPay. Just my 2 cents. Suggest to migrate code to python. So that everything can install using a simple python setup command. Lots of webmasters don't take anything related to windows seriously ;)
@_date: 2019-09-02 12:22:27
Before worrying about the bloat, the immediate problem is that it will most cross [the gap limit]( and wallet will stop discovery of funds received in subsequent addresses. Yes, to make this work even on a moderately used website, some recycling logic must be present.
Still, I like the simplicity of this tool, good work ! Hope community can contribute to make it better

18 million raised and now they are running out of money ! ludicrous ! Are they sending a man to mars ?

Unused addresses must be recycled not the used ones. Analysis can still be done when all addresses are different via clustering.  
To avoid recycling logic becoming very complex, it could result a few cases of duplicate addresses.  That should still be reasonable
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:14:20
Thanks. I will forward this to blockonomics guys !

Point taken. People must be careful before attempting to send money to that address. This is useful for quick balance/tx search to vanity address. One of the reason our search is case sensitive.

interesting ! Bookmarked ... 
Asking for private key is a bit scary. I want to use your tool but don't have time to review source code. Could you change this so that it doesn't ask for private key and just generates the transaction. I can then sign the transaction using electrum 
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:01:08
Thanks . Appreciate your kind words
@_date: 2015-09-16 06:39:01
Thanks . We never thought anyone would type more than ten characters for prefix search , so designed system to store only 10 character prefix. We can increase it.. how many do you think would be useful ....
Also our blockexplorer doesn't support txid search. Could you remove it from txid search for now

great stuff ! Needs to be opensource for me to install it on my machine

This is really not increasing adoption. But conversion to fiat. The motive of BTC is to replace fiat/banking. If we keep  using USD that  doesn't serve any purpose. For example. customers could themselves sell their BTC on an exchange and then pay the merchant
Here is a list of Bitpay alternatives you can have a look:
@_date: 2018-07-13 11:53:13
Please have a look at [this post]( for a list. Let me know if you need any clarifications. 
BtcPay is very nice... but everyone cannot do the technicals of running a node and installation various packages and then maintaining it. 
Its more easier for business to use a simple browser solution and concentrate their efforts on their store  rather than technicals behind accepting bitcoins
@_date: 2015-09-30 10:39:47
very good post, one of the key points there is that Namecoin supports atomic trading of a name whereas blockstore storing only hash in OP_RETURN, this is not the case. You need to run a full node to verify correctness
Quoting the blog
 It means that if you wrote an SPV client for Blockstore, I would be able to create an OP_RETURN output in the Bitcoin blockchain that claimed ownership of any arbitrary name, and your SPV client would not be able to detect the fraud
@_date: 2015-11-23 16:40:20
Yes ofcourse, app will be opensource.

Really ? Do we need this right now ... I was a supporter of onename and really liked the idea. When already blocks are running full with money txs, could onename team elaborate why the switch from namecoin is needed ?

Good angle of owning equity in Bitcoin.


This is not true for majority of people excluding probably few people. As you know most bitcoin businesses are not profitable. I think working your regular job and getting crypto as salary is a better way forward.

Good question. I dont think protonmail etc. have an interface where they support sending bitcoins. Though you can send a private key through encrypted email service to the recepient.
The difference is written in our [FAQ](
* How is this better than me mailing directly my private key ?  
If sender mails his private key, receiver is not sure of complete control of bitcoins. Anytime the sender can withdraw the bitcoins.

Yes there is a loss of privacy. We allow users to keep using guest login (without signup ). Also user can enter multiple addresses not belonging to him to mask address ownership. We do understand that is is not as private as desktop wallet. Our webapp is much more user friendly to track bitcoin than other wallets and user can also get email notifications to tx also. We welcome suggestions to improve user privacy.

I think its 1, by not shutting down and overseeing exchanges they can still track money flow, which would otherwise not be possible. Exchanges are already highly regulated, I expect documentation requirements to increase.

- Then search the amount on the block pages

Good idea. But I don't think people have time/patience to open their wallet and pay for the photos ... when all these photos are easily available on 4chan / deviantart.

Thanks for explaining this Justin.  I have two questions:
1. How has Case2 to do anything with HD wallet ? Your service just follows the link to get a unique address. The payment process could just be generating a new adddress  using RNG everytime
2.  What prevents the DNS lookup service from secretly changing the address under the hood ? I don't think DNS is adding much of a value. I don't care much about the privacy of my wallet name.  I care more about the lookup being correct.  If the lookup happens on the blockchain atleast I am sure of the integrity.
Good project. Will keep track of this.

As we already mentioned in our post, xpub is related to privacy risk rather than security.  You can also add several wallet addresses at once, without uploading your xpub.
We have been running for last 2 years and lot of people use our site to track their coins, so its in our best interest to keep that data safe and retain our users. Also you can use guestlogin to avoid having ur xpub/address being associated with  emailid/personal data. 
We try our best to protect our customer's privacy and clearly state that we cannot provide levels of privacy comparable to a wallet or bitcoind.  Our USP is our user interface, ease of use and tracking all wallets at one place. Most of the times users are willing to trade-off some privacy for this. Anyway we do understand privacy concerns of different users and welcome suggestions to improve our privacy and security.
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:40:10
When customers are paying via credit card, you should rather take the money recieved, why convert that into bitcoin and then incurr extra fee.
 To get real advantages of bitcoin you should directly accept bitcoin, this provides privacy and security that is desired (for example you cannot directly charge them every month like credit cards)
