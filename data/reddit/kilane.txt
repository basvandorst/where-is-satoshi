People who can place $200,000 in an escrow account have different bankers than you or me.  They'll be just fine.

You're kidding me, right?  Maybe you're just being dense for the sake of argument.  
Do you really not understand the difference between a poor person managing to save up 30,000 over 20 years and a rich person holding onto 10 million bc it has a good rate of return.  Take 10 seconds and think about the difference in wealth between the top 10% and the bottom 90%.  And the truly poor are going to be the bottom 20-40%.
This sub sometimes just brings out the idiocy in people so they can make minor points and nitpick obvious truths.

And compared to $1,280,000,000,000 it's meaningless.  Less than less than a rounding error.  
Go ahead and go on another tangent while downvoting me.  No point talking to you.

Because in inflationary currencies investing in money is a losing prospect (with exceptions).  With a deflationary currency, investing in money is a winning prospect.  So the rich hoard money until they have it all because it is constantly increasing in value as less and less is in circulation.

Poor can't hold cash...  
And if they do, it's an inconsequential amount.

It's almost as if there is a right answer and a wrong answer.
