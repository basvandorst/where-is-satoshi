Maybe the phones come with a loaded BTC wallet.

I am also in. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:25:03
Or both?

You are a genius, upvoted. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:44:29
Or not.

Can I send you my money first and only when you receive them you send me BTCs?

Hodling only benefits the whale’s game. If we all would sell after a 30% drop in 3 days, they would  have no way to sell their remaining coins without crashing the market. By hodling, we make them stronger.

I hope you are right.

Another dinosaur.

That’s a little short sighted.

That in the picture is a highland cow not a bull. Let’s hope the run is not a cow-run.

I just think the picture is way bigger. Of course any investor is looking for the highest return as possible and this is what drives innovation. Early Apple’s or Amazon’s investors were probably driven by the opportunity to get a return similar to that obtained by early Microsoft investors. What’s wrong with that? This is not a war between BTC and alts, this is a technological revolution and there will be many winners.

Are bullish markets back?
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:20:38
While you are an idealistic. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 20:26:31
Can you write more than three words?

They are great. Best customer service ever. They reply to a ticket I have opened in 2 hours.

My favourite.
