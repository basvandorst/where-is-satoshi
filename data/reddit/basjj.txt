Strange that we now have to trust one single guy with his signature to store all total of the billions of $ of all Electrum users? :/
What if he wants to retire and ships a final malware in his latest build?
What if the FBI sends a team at his home without Thomas noticing, and include a coin-stealing code in his Electrum code and publish it?
Should be "trustless" and we have to trust one single guy's signature for storing billions in coins :)

Yes that's the interesting part: how is this done in the code? (Of course I'll read it, but if someone can explain, it will help my reading of the code).
Is there a global "Nodes IP database" file on each node, that remembers all IPs present in the network?

It's not about emotion, it's about tech and architecture design. My main concern is UX, and I see that all worldwide-widely-adopted solutions nowadays are the ones that have an easy workflow / easy UX (Paypal: one email - one account. Amazon: buy in 1-click, will be delivered in 24h), and as both a user and software developer, I understand that and I agree.  
People expect simplicty. I fear that adding more layers on top of the existing ones will make BTC less accessible to the average user.  
This is not propaganda, but sane self-questioning about the future of the technology we're building.

Sure, but when looking in forums like here, LN seems to be the only main addition suggested in the next months to lower the fees (except SegWit which is currently being adopted in more and more places).
What other enhancement to solve the fee problem is currently considered seriously for the next 6 months?
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:27:46
Just looking at the main topics that discuss about scaling solutions: 50%+ posts speaking about scaling those days are about LN.
Thus my question: do we have other plans? Don't want to have all eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:59:05














Of course, this is true, and I agree with you, but at least the disagreement in UX for the user (having to deal with multiple accounts, having funds on savings account that can't be moved easily) is balanced by the marketing argument "Yes, but you'll get interests!". 
My point is: it's ok to make the user's life / UX more complex by having to use multiple accounts, but we have to give something in exchange. Giving *"Well you'll have to use to use multiple accounts, because technically we are not able to give a simple-UX 1-account solution"* is not that great.
Paypal has become mainstream for many reasons, but one of them is that because it's dead simple: one email - one account. You don't need to "fund a subaccount" with account's money to have easily-movable money. 
=&gt; You just have 1 account. Simple. And important for the average user.
It's already complex enough for an average user (have to deal with private keys, addresses, storing of the keys, trezor, etc.), if we add another layer now, it'll get out really really complex for the average user.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:11:37
Nice quote ;) but how will you explain the channels to an average user?
It's a bit like *"Congratulations, you have now created a Paypal account. Oops ... before being able to use it, you need to create a subaccount, and fund it, with money of your main account, etc. For this you need to do a regular transaction, which will cost 20$. But then it will be free."*
Average users are now usually expecting simpler UX like Paypal (they defined a new standard, didn't they?).
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:05:15
Thanks for the reference about channels, I didn't know that.


How would you explain this to an average user? (e.g. your mother). Let's say she says *"Phew, after reading many things, I finally managed to create a wallet, and buy some BTC, that are now on my main address 1Auhsqd2531kX.  
"*. What will you say then? *"Good job, but it's not finished yet. You have to create another channel, etc."*
What would be the natural justification for an average user (in a good tech system, he shouldn't be informed about the internal problems)?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:25:59
The video is good until 
*"By each sending one bitcoin"*: Average user: Oucchh, sending 1 BTC, 11000$? not for me!
*"to a multisignature address"*: Average user: beginning to be lost!
*"Temporarily locked... "*: Average user: ouchh too much complicated, this is not for me.
**This video is great for those of you that aren't technical**: not at all
Well, it shows that we shouldn't expect LN adoption soon before 2 or 3 years at least, and we should look at other solutions.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:23:08
Thanks for your detailed answer, it helped a lot. 






Who controls these seed IP? Isn't there a risk that their current owners are bought by superbig companies (Ver etc.) or that gov / NSA quietly ask the providers of these IP and silently replace the nodes by "their" nodes, who will give "their own list" of other "controlled by them" nodes?


When does it stop? When the list contains 100, 1000, 10000 nodes? More? Just to understand more, how many nodes does your cache contain?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:28:48
Thanks for the edit! I already tried  which looks very cool, but it doesn't seem to address the difficult part: the "cohabitation" between on-chain BTC and channel-funded BTC, how to transfer from the one to the other, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:17:13
What do you mean by **allocating a few thousands USD on a channel**?
Does creating a lightning channel need to allocate a certain amount?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:42:58
Thanks. So this means there is an article in "Terms and condition" that you are liable for negative balance. Have you found it?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:14:43
Looks wonderful. However:
* This is off-chain, right? If so, what about security? Avoidance of double-spending?
* Isn't this just centralized in a few servers? if so, how to achieve true decentralization with this method?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:29:34
What would have happened in case you didn't pay it? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:24
Yes but this part is not visible in  you don't see both on-chain and channel there. This part is only a channel, right?
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:10:30
yeah, bread is soooo overvalued
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:03:31
Hum ok... Not 100% sure to understand, but I'll try Eclair app to get it.
Big question is: if we want adoption as a currency, how to make this easy-to-use for the average citizen?
On-chain, channels (that need to be opened and funded, and sometimes closed), etc.
Then this means there are many keys to remember (private keys for blockchain wallet, keys for channel(s), etc.)
Isn't it a bit early for making it more complex?
It's a bit like "Bitcoin is becoming more and more well known, let's add another layer of complexity so that people restart from 0".  I don't find this very good for adoption of BTC in the public.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:28:48
Do you mean it could arrive if margin call closing doesn't work fast enough, and finally you loose more than initial deposit?
How does it work then? Are there contract conditions terms stating that we are liable for negative balance?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:01:44
Thanks. Does "allocate bitcoin you plan to use on the network" require a regular transaction (and so a 10$-20$ fee)?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:31:06
Pro tip: use NiceHash pool
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:23:27
That's true. Just asking, which path seems to be the most widely accepted among Bitcoin contributors?
i.e. is it a good or bad thing to have for example the blockchain growing of 5 GB per day for small grocery store transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:08:20
Thanks! What is the most popular Lighning wallet on desktop computer (usable with testnet), similar to Electrum? I should try this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:05:02
How do you quickly send from exchange X to coinbase/gdax?
To do this you need fast movement across exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:20:49
Does tx broadcast really happen one by one now? I thought it was broadcasted one by one for only a few nodes (until enough confirmations) and then it's broadcasted in blocks?
Does this mean that currently, for each single transaction in the world, there is a network connection between all nodes?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:24:59
I thought I understood how LN works, but then I don't understand how it works. Can you explain who should allocate what? 
The sender? the recipient? the shop owner who wants a channel for his shop?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:14:56
Thanks, I'll try this app definitely to understand how it works. 
Is it true that you have to initially "deposit" on-chain BTC =&gt; to on-channel-BTC?
If so, isn't Lighning like (sorry to use this word) an alt-coin, i.e. you take your **real** BTC to make a deposit in *another system*, and then you use this *converted* amount (which is not "on-chain BTC" anymore) off-chain... and then if you want to get back some **real BTC**, you have to withdraw the "on-channel BTC" into "on-chain BTC"?
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:52:13
Yes but [here]( you can see a leverage up to 5, so this must be margin trading, right?
Do you think that:
* if Leverage is "None", then we're in scheme 1.
* if Leverage &gt;= 2, then we're in scheme 2.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:49:57
That's what I was expecting for Tier 2: a few weeks, but finally it was just 1 hour, surprise!
Is Kraken safe/good, do you have positive experience since May?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:13:25
Thanks for your feedback!


You mean storing crypto on an exchange will be off chain, and it's safer to transfer to either bank account or on-real-blockchain (back to blockchain with a withdrawal to electrum wallet for example). Is that what you mean? (I ask because kind of new in crypto).


Good idea, I'll activate 2 factor auth right now
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:30:39
Maybe or maybe not ;)
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:21:25
What is your experience with it?
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:04:34
Sure, but where, which platform?
Also if the price is *really* dropping, they *will* want to buy, but then if 1 hour later it's lower again, they will want to "please wait 1 more hour", "please wait 1 more hour" to buy even cheaper...
I would like to find a way to sell fast.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:57:12
Ok that's what I thought but was not sure. Do you also confirm that:
* if Leverage is set to "None", then we're in scheme 1: you are really buying BTC
* if Leverage &gt;= 2, then we're in scheme 2.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:43:35
What is your experience with it?
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:26:19
A related question: if I do a deposit in BCH (bitcoin cash), if I open a position + close it, will I be back with BCH? 
How to make a deposit with BCH into Kraken and never hear about BCH anymore? (i.e. sell BCH and get BTC in exchange and no more have BCH).
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:32:44
Which platform offers such kind of trading in BTC?
In traditional EUR/USD margin trading, you can loose more than your deposit, that's the reason why "negative balance protection" (not available for every broker) exists. If the position cannot be closed quickly enough, you can loose more than deposit.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:07:00
I would prefer USD or EUR in this case. Because if BTC is really dropping, it might impact other cryptos too.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:05:02
What happens if the margin call system cannot close a position quickly enough (imagine a verrrrry fast market move). Will this platform give you negative balance?
A second question can you use this platform with just a deposit in BTC (and no credit card, no use of real identity / home address -&gt; i don't want to have bailiff at home if negative balance).
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:38:31
In fact I don't want to buy BCH, I have some, that I want to use to fund my Kraken account, but then I don't want to hear about my old BCH anymore. My question was: if I deposit my Kraken account with BCH, will the balance finally always stay in BCH? (I wouldn't want that)
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:57:28
Thanks. I'll have a look there for similar questions.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:20:04
Are you sure you'll want to buy at time T, if you feel that at "time T + 30 minutes", it will be 10% lower price? ;)  (that's the case in the case of a massive market drop!)
Which escrow site would you use?
Which country are you from?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:39:16
Why? It's simple:
You have a new tech (bitcoin) that took 9 years to mature and begin to have an adoption *outside* of geeks/nerds/redditors like us.
Then when the bitcoin UI/UX just *begins* to be understood by the masses, we say this: "*You began to understand how it works, and you wanted to join? Sorry because we added a new layer of complexity in the system"*.
To do a comparison, let's say you teach additions at school to 6 y.o. children.  You have 2 solutions:
* Cool, now 20% of the class understands how it works. Let's practice more on additions!
* Cool, now 20 % of the class understands how it works. Let's add a new complexity layer and I'll teach you multiplications and divisions right now.
Bitcoin basically chose option 
Are you really thinking masses will like Bitcoin with the need to fund channels etc.??
