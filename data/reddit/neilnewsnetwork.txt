i'm no expert, but the last 2 years have been totally level (averaged out)
no reason to feel it will be any different the next two.
this isn't so bad, except for one thing.  If anyone put that same money into stocks, they'd be up 25% over the last 2 years
So, even bitcoin staying even is a huge loss (if you factor in opportunity costs).  And if bitcoin keeps going down, those losses are even greater.
I can not think of *any* good reason why anyone should put any new money into bitcoin.  not one.

not really a problem.  bad analogy.


also, not true.  even something like apple pay, which is brand new and just came out, has more people using it than bitcoin, which has been around for over a decade.  Every major website and publication has done front page stories on bitcoin, and info about it is everywhere, but are any but a very minor handful even buying it? Nope.  Are people using it to pay for things? even fewer.
I mean, as a total long shot gamble, I bought some.  But I have not drunk the kool-aid, I know bitcoin risky and unstable, and i can see clearly that a week where price drops by 25% is a bad week.  Anyone who can't admit that is living in a different reality from my reality, which is based on facts and logic (not dreams, wishes and hopeful thinking).

its highest price to date was 20k
its price 2 years ago on this day was almost the same as it it today.
no offense, but you are wrong
look up november 21 2017 price (you'll see, the price then is same as now, two years later)
seriously, you need to check facts a little closer, thanks!
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:56:06
Bitcoin is getting totally killed, but how much you want to bet that someone says about this disaster...
"oh its not bad at all that bitcoin is losing all its value, its just an 'opportunity' to buy"
"besides, we got into it for the 'technology', we don't care what the price is"
no matter how bad things get (and they are pretty terrible) there will always be someone who tries to act like truly bad news is really a cause for celebration.  
Spoiler alert, none of this is good, this is a bad, bad, bad ....bad week for bitcoin.  On every level, this sucks.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:53:36
yes, this is exactly the sort of thing i was talking about
bitcoin is doing bad this week, really bad.  Everyone can see that
and yet, there are some who act like its good news, and that there is nothing bad happening.
i try, but oh well, there's only so many red pills i can hand out, and if people want to keep on popping blue pills, i guess, can stop them.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:37:22
nothing personal, but this sort of thing is why bitcoin is considered a bit of a joke.
instead of simply saying "oh this is bad" certain people twist themselves into pretzels trying to pretend bad news is good news.
I mean, if the value of any other 'normal' investment like real estate or stocks was down 20 or 30% (with no end in sight) people that invest in those things would say "the market is doing very bad".
But with bitcoin, people say its great when bitcoin goes up in price, and its even greater when it crashes down in price.
That so many can not be honest about bad bitcoin news is why we are not taken seriously, and rightly so. 
And if we continue to willingly choose to live in a bubble of denial, and claim that ALL news about bitcoin, is good news, then bitcoin will just become (even more of) a joke than it is right now.
Its an unstable, and fragile investment, and sure... put some money into it (i did) but know that its a long shot gamble, at best.

i wasn't talking about some other time, i was talking about november
you do know that november and december are two totally different months?  and that mid november and end of december are not the same, right?
so, no offense, but just to be clear.... 2 years  ago, the price of bitcoin was the same as it is today (give or take a few hundred dollars)
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:30:51
no offense, but look at the bitcoin price 2 years ago on this day
then look at the price today
almost the same.
Thats what i mean, its gone up and down, but here we are at essentially the same price.
As for stocks, if you stuck your funds into a good fund like Chalres Schwab or the one I use, Vanguard, two years ago, and then just left it there your capital would be up about 25%.  In my case, i am up 23.4% over the last two years.
Anyway, not here to start an argument, I am just saying that three years ago until 2 years ago, bitcoin had a bit jump in price.  As of two years ago, averaged out, its been level.
Will it spike again? I dont know, but my opinion is that it will stay level for quite a while more.  And with the stock market doing so amazingly well, it doesn't make sense for me to put any new money into an investment that I dont think will go up.
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:49:31
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:17:53
yes, bitcoin had a spike a few years ago and before
i'm just saying, based on over two years, it seems like its over
it is doing about 20% worse than regular investments like stocks/bonds and real estate
so, even if bitcoin stays level, youre losing at least 20% by keeping it in bitcoin as opposed to something better
not hating on bitcoin, just pointing out the economic reality
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:12:59
you bring up things that happened years ago, and hey... thats cool, talk about the past all you like.
but look at what i actually said "this is a bad, bad, bad ....bad week for bitcoin."
and that is true.  This has been a terrible week for bitcoin, and anyone who says otherwise is living in a bubble of denial.

no matter how much we try to get others to use bitcoin, public opinion has spoken, and they are clearly saying "sorry, we know you want this to be a thing, but its just not gonna be a thing"
lots of voices pushing for widespread adoption, but it reminds me of the endless advertising for the microsoft zune, people just dont want it, and nothing could be done to change that.

and hey, in the case of coinbase, if a few customers here and there lose all their assets, and cant even get ahold of a human being to straitghten it out?  oh well, coinbase doesnt care.
they still have endless new customers coming in, and since the whole system is (mostly) automated, they spend next to nothing to keep it going.
Basically, its just a big robot built by tech titans, that has ZERO concern (or even an ability to care)

Trumps lies?
A typical "Trump lie" is that he had more people at his inauguration than Obama.
or that his weight is 238 (when, looking at him, it seems like he weighs more).
Meanwhile, Trump is enacting policies that I like (especially his approach to China, trade in general, the lower unemployment, and a less interventionist foreign/mideast war policy).
So, when it comes to any of these "egregious" lies that the left is perpetually outraged by? I say ho-hum (i could care less).
On the other hand, when nearly the entire left political class and nearly all left wing media is going around (even now) spreading things like the lie that Trump said white nationalists and nazis were "fine people", I dont hear a peep.
Spreadking a lie that a US president is pro-nazi is actually damaging to the country (whereas saying you weigh less that you do, probably is no big deal, in the grand scheme of things).
Scott Adams (Dilbert cartoonist of all people) actually has a pretty good explanation of [this]( hoax.
Having said all that, I am not even against someone who is a traditional liberal, or even an old school democrat.  Many lefties of the past, such as Dennis Kucinich or Jimmy Carter, are good and decent people.  I might disagree with their policies, but they seem sound, grounded, and reasonable.  My differences with them is based on approach (and i never doubted their intent was honorable and for the greater good).  But todays modern left has been completely taken over by insane people.  Seriously, most reasonable people on the left, at least among themselves, know that the leftist movement has gone off a cliff).  
I am no expert, but i think that the election of 2020 could be a real disaster for them.  People are afraid to publicly say they support Trump, but i do think there is a silent majority that will vote for him (If not because they like him, at least because they know the alternative can not be trusted with the reigns of power).
And in DC, the democrat party has done nothing for 3 years but investigate Trump for "Russia" or who knows what?
Pelosi has had the USMCA for over a year, and won't even hold a vote on it (this isn't controversial, people. A US/Mexica/Canada trade agreement is an everyone's best interests) Same with the bill to lower prescription drugs that the Senate has approved, and Trump says he will sign, but that Pelosi will not hold a vote on.
I dont even mind if the democrats tried to beat Trump at the ballot booth, but these endless peach-mint hearings are a joke, will not pass the Senate, and are the only thing that the democrat party and their media lackeys have focused on for years now.  
They have been screaming impeachment since his FIRST day in office.  No one believes these hearings are organic, or true.
Meanwhile, outside the DC beltway, things are getting better economically, and by most other metrics (other than the leftist outrage-o-meter) in the USA.
Especially impacted positively are Black and Latinos (this is doubly true when you look at the economic prospects of Black and Latino men under 35 - a group that has been hardest economically hit in recent years)
So good economy, prison reform, a focus on manufacturing, finally cracking down on the unbalanced, and unethical trade practices of china,  less US troops fighting overseas, etc) thats what matters to me, more than whether or not Trump posted and impolite tweet, or said something that a liberal fact-checker did not think was true.

As a dual UK/USA citizen, hello fellow limey!
As for you " I don't know enough about American politics " comment, the closet analogy to Trump vs. non-Trump people compared to the UK is the pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit debate in England.
Not the same issue, but those (in both cases) who are more pro-globalist and more aligned with the elite classes tend to be anti-Brexit (or in the case of America, anti-Trump.)
and those that are more patriotic, less globalist and who don't particularly like the elite classes, they tend to be pro-Brexit (or in the case of America, pro-Trump.)
It really depends on how much you trust authority, and whether you want to be more self-reliant, or whether you are willing to give more of your power to the government in return for their "protection".
It's not a perfect comparison, but that should give you a good general idea about politics here in the USA.

the worst part is that I cant log in, which (with any normal company that gives even the smallest shit about its customers) this is a fixable problem.
every other financial institution that holds peoples money (such as banks or brokerages, etc) has a phone number, and talking to human being is an option.
sadly, with coinbase, its all a scam.  they technically have a phone number, but when you call it is says "submit a ticket online"
what an unnecessary hassle (oh, and I did submit a ticket to them online, and guess  what? no reply)

good luck.
NO PHONE SUPPORT
NO LIVE CHAT
ONLY slowAF email support, and (the one time i needed it) totally unhelpful
Eventually, I got my issues resolved, but only by asking strangers on reddit for advice.  It did take about 30-40 hours of research, me trying a bunch of things that did NOT work first,  and all in all, about 2 weeks to resolve - all of which was SUPER annoying, as (if they had actual working tech support with a human being) it could have probably been resolved/explained in about 30 minutes.  Sigh.
Being dependent upon the advice of random (but eventually helpful) strangers is a terrible option in dealing with one's wealth.
But, in the case of Ledger, that was the only option for me.
Thats why I will never use Ledger again (at lest not until they get actual support that works).
I mean, yes... I get it, it works MOST of the time, but if it doesnt, there is too much to lose to be leaving it up to strangers.
You could lose it all.
Anyway, that way my experience, hopefully you'll have a better experience getting help from Ledger than I did.
@_date: 2019-12-20 08:50:15
my feelings exactly
you are not alone.
people on here say bitcoin is easy to use
in my experiences, its always a pain, sometimes a total disaster
and WAAAAAY more ID checks and verification than fiat.
even the exchange i used (coinbase) has locked me out twice, for no reason.
my cold storage (a ledger) that didn't work for a bit... then it did (annoyingAF to deal with)
and buying stuff? seems to be a SNAFU of some sort *every* time.
the world of people who accept bitcoin is full of scammers and unethical sites and merchants.
and if there is a problem, there's little recourse.
All in all, NOT use friendly

thats all well and good, but some sort of contractual agreement that they draw up will rarely trump established real estate law (if the two are in conflict).
meaning, you can have an agreement to hold through volitility, but in actual practice, the buyer can almost always walk away at any point prior to closing, whereas the seller is trapped into the sale should the buyer perform.

Price, over the last two years, just slowly slides down (on average)
I hope it comes back, but we need to be honest and admit that these last 2 wars have been terrible.

you can set up escrow rules to make it so the buyer cant back out easily... except, that real estate laws (long on the books) that give the buyer countless paths to back out, will take precedent over terms of escrow.
As i said earlier, existing real estate laws tilt STRONGLY in favor of the buyer.  Like these laws or not, the government has decided that it doesn't want a system where buyers are forced to buy a home they dont want, or otherwise decide that is not right for them.
Real estate law is not regular contract law, the rules are not equal between both parties, and protection after protection is in there to protect the buyer, and allow them to slip out (even with the flimsiest of reasons) 
Thats just the system, and anyone entering into the position of being a home seller should be informed of this.
and yes... you are correct, generally a refundable down payment is made (to be deposited within a day or two of acceptance of offer) and then there are various contingencies and inspections to be dealt with before money is released (from either the buyer directly or their lender).

@_date: 2019-12-05 20:31:24


This type of thought is how people wind up in court.
As a realtor, I never trust people's "best intentions".  
With hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line, and even honest people having memory lapses or misunderstanding, i would advice everyone to just get it in writing, and have total (written) clarity.
Better yet, if you want bitcoin, just sell the house and buy bitcoin with the proceeds of the sale, you are introducing unnecessary litigious elements.
And still i dont get why you would "I would sell the house priced in dollars but transacted in BTC"
Just sell in cash value (not the bitcoin equivalent of cash on the day of sale).  Seriously (IMHO) you are just making things weird, and complex, to make a point.
Not to mention, (posible) additional tax consequences.  Tax law is specifically and narrowly written to be advantageous to profits made from real estate.  You could potentially lose that advantage if the capital gains are passed through bitcoin, and (possibly?) considered to be a profit from bitcoin's capital gains (as opposed to the property's increase in value).
Either way, you've just added the need for an additional consultation with an accountant to both parties come tax time.
There is a value in talking to people who are financial experts, and I can't help but imagine that EVERY financial expert that you could ever talk to would advise you against this exact course of action.  
Anyway, thats my 2 cents, do your own due diligence, and good luck to you in whatever you wind up doing.

No evidence either way.  NONE.
Odds are it will, but my guess? it will be YEARS from now.
If you have money to invest, and want a MUCH more likely positive return, I would suggest you invest in a reliable low-fee fund like Vanguard or Charles Schwab.
Do some research on where, but r/personalfinance has some good general info.
If you do that kind of investing, the odds of a positive return are MUCH higher than risky bitcoin, and the risk of loss is very low.  Its much safer.
In bitcoin, even if it's price is flat, you are losing money in opportunity costs (assuming you had your money somewhere else).
I can only speak for myself, but I have been buying and HODLing for 2 years, and i am down negative 40% on my bitcoin investments
On the other hand, i have funds in Vanguard, and (over two years total) i am up positive 25% over the last 2 years.
So, invest in bitcoin as a fun experiment, or as a gamble, but as a well-thought out investment strategy, I could never recommend it to anyone.
Whatever you decide, best of luck to you!

Yes, sounds legit.

Other than the fact that its slightly deceptive to pretend like its an actual financial news show, you can believe this analysis, or not.

the fact that people have missing bitcoin, but the way to try to figure out where it went is to ask strangers on the internet shows one of the main problems with bitcoin (and why the majority of the public doesnt want to use it).
The whole system is a mostly-unsupported mess.  Yes, it does work most of the time, but when it doesnt, youre fucked (or if youre not fucked, you have to waste hours or days, to figure out where you bitcoin is).  Your average person does not have time for that shit.
Until there is some actual support for bitcoin (and the wallets that hold it) no one wants to trust their money to a system that is complex and without reliable technical support.

Also, of the hundreds of liberals that i know in LA, no one (of those that i personally know and interact with) has ever raged out at me, or attacked me.  So, I also do know that the average liberal is not as full as hate and endless rage. as they are often depicted. 
In my circle of friends, we all want the same thing, and we fight for the greater good (on all but the fewest of issues, it's essentially just a matter of how to *solve* the problem - and its only on the *approach* that we disagree upon).
All of which is to say, its nice to see that amongst all the insanity and heightened rhetoric &amp; "outrage" that good and reasonable people can get along after all.

i appreciate the input
and support your right to share your opinion
but, this was my title, my post, and as such, i chose to use the word that I felt best described the inept, idiots at coinbase
although, in retrospect, perhaps crooked or shady might have been more accurate descriptors.
As for whether or not something is "politically correct" or meets the approval of those who would choose to police the vocabulary of others, that is something that I could care less about.
Whether something is PC or non-PC, those are things that are of no concern to me.

never heard of a traditional  bank that just locked a customer out of their account, and then had no working phone number, or support of any kind that would get back in touch.
i'm not even defending regular banks, i am simply saying that traditional banks are not allowed to lock a customer out for no reason, and then just disappear and be totally unreachable from their customers.

yeah, cause its impossible that of the 60+ million people who voted for Trump (and the many millions more who support him but didnt vote) that someone would share a common sense, pro-Trump opinion?
No offense, but the way that you freely express your opinion, just because thats what humans tend to do (share their opinions and thoughts on the world) ...thats the same thing with us Trump supporters.
You may agree with us, you may not, but this charade of pretending that anyone who shares an opinion the deviates from democrat party talking points is someone being paid... well, honestly, its rhetorically lazy.
if you have a point to make, go head, make it (I'm happy to listen to an informed point of view, whether I agree of not).   Engage others in the marketplace of ideas, but claiming everyone is a paid troll? sigh... dont do that, it comes across as a little NPC.

I am not saying youre wrong
I am simply sharing my experience that for the little over two years that I have been involved with bitcoin, almost ALL I hear on here is how bitcoin is going to the moon
and yet, speaking in MY experience only, bitcoin has actually gone down in value since i purchased it.
I do hope it goes up, I was simply pointing out that (for me) its been a real money-losing turkey of an investment.
And every positive prediction (that have been endless these last 2 years) has been wrong (when you average out the entire two years)
One day my bitcoin will be worth more than I paid for them (I hope) but until that day comes, color me skeptical.

stay the hell away from doing anything but buying or HODLing until the technology is figured out
its not user friendly, its not totally stable, and if you do have problems, there is no where to go to solve the issue ...unless you consider asking strangers on reddit for help a potential solution (which i dont).
Let them all spend a few years solving all these issues and making it user friendly, until them, beware and be careful, and dont use.
@_date: 2019-12-05 20:18:08


(if thats what it seemed like, i apologize for not being clear enough)
not really.  volitility is fine
i was simply saying, if a person is selling something thats stable in price, and accept a payment in something like bitcoin that is extremely volatile, and the sale can take up to 30 days to complete, and its a case of the seller being able to pull out at any time, but where you as the buyer are trapped ...then in that case, its a situation where the seller is taking a great risk, with very little upside (this is doubly true in the case of a house, where - if in a desired city, - its priced fairly - and if its not defective - it is something that guaranteed to sell).
As for your comments on a mortgage, they are not really relevant to *this* discussion of buying a house, as there is no comparison between bitcoin sale and a mortgage sale (as there is no such thing as a bitcoin mortgage)
the only relevant comparison to bitcoin is whether its a bitcoin sale or cash offer sale.
But yes, in the larger sense, I do get your point, a seller (who believes in bitcoin and wants to own it) can make the choice to get a mortgage and keep their bitcoin.

Thats the nightmare scenario that no one wants to talk about (sometimes referred to as the Bitcoin Doomsday Scenario or the Bitpocolypse)
if the amount you can make from mining ever gets too low, then no one will want to mine at a loss (i mean, maybe briefly some will, but that will get old quick).
There will be temporary measures to add new fees or surcharges to encourage mining, but that won't really ever work (why pay big fees to use bitcoin, when there are other crypto assets to use instead? - right now none of the alts are as desirable as bitcoin, but if bitcoin's price gets too low, then certain alts start to look real good, real fast).
There could be periods of panic selling and whale buying and dumping, but in the end, prolonged low prices are what will kill bitcoin (if anything ever does).
so, in the doomsday scenario, bitcoin will just slowly die off from lack of miners being able to make money mining, which is the lynchpin upon which the whole system is built.
So be careful, don't invest what you cant afford to lose, and know that there are no guarantees in life, bitcoin (like anything else) could cease to exist, and it might be sooner than you think.
Not saying it will happen, i am simply saying it might.
@_date: 2019-12-14 00:29:41
yeah, just log on on the website, and then **get your secret code from coinbase** (or wherever).
Once you log in to coinbase you can just follow the instruction in their help section to get your secret code.
*If for some reason you can't log into coinbase via a browser, you'll have to contact them (they have a phone number, but rarely answer, so most likely you'll have to do it through email), then they will send you instructions to verify your identity, and then they will get you the code (but hopefully you can just log in, and won't need to do all this).*
and then, once you have your secret code, you install the new authenticator app on your new phone, and log in with your current email, etc.
When asked on the app, you can enter the secret code (manually or by the code photo).
Once you do that, you will be fine, and can use your authenticator on your new phone.
@_date: 2019-12-06 22:45:06
like i said, i am not defending banks, but what coinbase does (just not be reachable by any manner) is why they are so bad.
i mean, they literally make billions of dollars, ya think they could invest in a telephone?
As for banks, bad as they may be, you can at least call them, and talk to a human (something that is not even an option with conbase)
Once i get back in to coinbase (if i ever can) Im just going to take my btc out
whether it goes into cold storage, or Gemini, or some other place? I dont yet know
the only thing I do know is that I'm getting it off of coinbase (what a garbage company they are)
@_date: 2019-12-06 22:09:54
i'm not defending real banks
but i never had a real bank that i couldn't get ahold of.
with coinbase, just to do something as simple as log into my account, i have been emailing them on their support page for 2 days (no reply)
i have written  on twitter (no reply)
I have been calling them (no answer, just a recorded message to email them)
I have posted on the official coinbase reddit account (no reply)
I have posted on the official coinbase facebook page (no reply)
Coinbase has locked me out of my account, and there is no way to get in touch with them.  THEY SIMPLY DO NOT REPLY, or even allow users to contact them in any form.
So yes... bad as traditional banks may be, no bank would every take a customers money, and then lock them out for no reason at all, and then not be reachable in any manner.
so yes, coinbase is worse.

i neither support not don't support bitcoin being used as a currency.
i could care less whether or not people use it.  The ONLY thing i care about, in regard to bitcoin, is the price (and i hope the price goes up)
I was simply saying that people your house on the open market, and then selling it in bitcoin is not smart.

ok, sure
suggesting that someone tie up hundreds go thousands of dollars in a potential sale with red flags at every level, and without the many of the buyer protections of a traditional sale

thats cool, if its for an hour or two, but all day, every day, for days on end, no humans EVER answer

i bought bitcoin hoping it would increase in value (same as with every other speculative investment I ever purchased).
i only invested in BTC what i could afford to lose
i have only bought, and am still HODLing to this day.
I always knew it was a gamble and a long shot, and hey... my other investments (Vanguard funds and real estate, etc) are doing great in our booming economy.
my only real big financial loss was what i put into bitcoin.
Like i said, i knew it was a long shot, and I tried it, and (thus far) its been a total turkey.
I'll continue to HODL (why not, at this point its like gambling money, or buying a lottery ticket?) In my mind, the money is already gone, so any gains, at this point, are just a bonus.
Having said all that, anytime someone invests in an asset, and then (after 2 years) that asset has lost 40% of its value... well, in that case, most people (myself included) would not be happy with that investment.
So, we'll see what happens in the future, but in the meantime like any other human would be, i am not happy that my bitcoin value is down -40%
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:47:47

yes, i could (possibly) make money off of bitcoin ...one day.
although, to be a worthwhile investment, bitcoin would have to do better than my other investments (which at approx +10% interest, double in total value every 7 years.)
So, unless bitcoin (from this point on) doubles in value every 7 years, its a money loser (when you take opportunity costs into account).
I mean, what i have already in bitcoin, i will HODL (I look upon bitcoin as just gambling at this point) but I cant say I think that buying any more would be a good idea.
I mean, maybe if it goes down to 1K, I would gamble, and buy some more bitcoin??? But all in all, its not a safe enough bet to purchase any more of (especially with the economy doing so great overall, and everything else that I invest in making me good and safe returns.)

@_date: 2019-12-05 21:23:52
sure, do as you wish
but not doing at less basic due diligence, and having an inspection, geological report, title search, liens on property,  and a few other absolutely basic (and i would say necessary) things investigated, takes *some* time.
Plus, you have to schedule many of these things, and often deal with local municipal governments along the way (when looking into things like liens, property records, the title, environmental or other reports), etc.
Thats not to say that you can't close within 10 days *if you rush*.  But in my opinion, I would always advice a buyer to allow at least 10 days to close (ideally at least 30).
Either way, there are many problems with this sort of sale for a seller (unless you magically find a buyer who wants to offer what you are selling for and they want to do it with no inspections or other contingencies of any kind).
But this sort of thing (a non-financed, no contingencies or delay-of-any-kind-sale, at full price and paid in a non-dollar currency) is so rare, that I can't even imagine it.
I mean, an investor type might roll the dice, and offer $50-100K less for an immediate cash sale, but unless you (the seller) needed to sell immediately for some reason, why do that?
Why not wait one month, and make $50-100K more?
Anyway, do as you wish, I was just saying on here, the same advice or thoughts that i would offer to a client.
But yes... invest, or spend as you feel is best (or avail yourself to whichever advisors you feel are most beneficial to you), when buying a house for yourself.

This community has 1.2 million users, post enough on here (and do it every day, week, month, etc), and you can affect the behavior of several thousand, perhaps even 100K people.

yeah, us people who bought bitcoin are sooooo much better than them
hey, if thats how you feel, so be it.
I think that I am no better or worse than those who dont own bitcoin
if anything, they are smarter than I am.
I know i bought bitcoin, and i am down negative 40% in that investment, meanwhile the rest of my investments (vanguard funds and real estate) are doing great.
Luckily, i only invested what i can afford to lose in bitcoin,  Still, an investment that loses so much value (even worse, that it does so in such a bull market and roaring economy) is not something that I would use to prop myself up.
Like i said, i can only speak for MY experience, but in MY experience over the last 2 years, bitcoins been a real turkey.
Yes, I will still hodl, but its not like I am better than a normie who didnt buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-06 05:40:14
Yes, you "get it".
I tried to explain clearly, but you're probably right, its something that takes years to understand, so perhaps I was overly ambitious in thinking I could explain such things in a reddit post or two.
@_date: 2019-12-06 07:45:58


still not a good deal for the buyer (you sound like someone who's never bought a house)
all thats still gonna take a couple weeks, and without a signed offer, anyone else can put in a binding offer.
now, you've spent a few thousand for inspections, title etc, and you can't even buy it.
if you want to buy or sell a house, do it the safe way, as opposed to blindly stumbling through it, and simply trusting some stranger who's selling a house.

I keep hearing people talk about this or that development that will cause bitcoin value to increase soon
you know the so-called reasons, so i won't list them all here.
Anyway, I have been hearing that bitcoin price will be going high, high, high any month now.
And hey... that's cool, but I have been hearing this for 2 years straight.
and (averaged out) the last two years have been a net negative, in fact.
Hey, i dont mind HODLing, but lets just stop with the "its going to go WAY up talk?"
Can't we just admit, we have no idea what it will do?  And they even though we HOPE it will go up, no one really knows?
Basically, every positive prediction over the last 2 years has been wrong.  
The first rule is to get out of denial and admit things have been dire.
And hey, if anyone really does know when (or if) bitcoin will go up in value, then please share.
Other wise, it still seems like a gamble, and potentially risky.
I (personally) am going to hodl, but i also would never recommend being bitcoin to anyone else (too many unknowns)
Lets hope for the best, but be honest enough to prepare for the worst.

I remember my username and my password
after i enter that, conbase says that I need to enter my authenticator app code 
so then i go and enter that code, it gets rejected (even though its always worked before, and I changed nothing).

thanks, and yes, its weird... pointing out that the entire bitcoin infrastructure is inhospitable and largely non-navigable to those who are not crypto-tech savvy gets you attacked on here (and many other tech forums).
In reality, regular people dont want to deal with this sort of nonsense, they want something that *just works*.
and that won't just make their bitcoin disappear if they make the wrong technical error.
Until bitcoin becomes user friendly for regular people, its not going anywhere.
A bunch of crypto aficionados expecting normies to delve as deeply as they have.... well, thats never going to happen.
@_date: 2019-12-26 05:23:59
quote past gains all you like
yes, there were big surges
but thats over (or at the least stagnant)
if you look at the last 2 years, its actually down.
and there is no evidence that it will ever surge in that manner again.
on the other hand, the last two years, if you bought stocks, you would be up about 25%
if you bought bitcoin, you would be down.
so, this is a really dumb way to look at investing
then again, anyone who gets their investing advice from memes on twitter, well... they are probably lacking in financial acumen.

first of all, its not a "scam"  but its not something that helps you, as the buyer.
its an insurance policy that a lender MAKES the borrower purchase (as a condition of the loan) that has the lender as the beneficiary.
basically, it says if the lender pays for the house, and then the house didnt really belong to a person claiming to be the onwer, then they (the lender) will still get paid, by the insurance company.
In other words, yes (if need be) the title insurance company will pay out if the house did not have a clear title, but they will pay out the lender for the money that the lender lost (as the borrower would no longer be responsible for paying on that loan).
Title insurance protects them (the lender).  Whether or not the lender had title insurance, if the seller did not have title, you (the borrower) are no longer required to pay the lender on the mortgage.
That you buy this insurance is just a condition of the loan.  its usually in the $300-700 range, so not a big deal.  Just another cost that is part of the loan.
When you look into the costs a loan, over 30 years, it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars, so overly focusing on a small ticket item like title insurance as opposed to the total costs is just silly.
Who cares? Just see what the lender requires you spend (closing costs, and all the other fees, and points and interest rate, PMI, etc.  and then run those numbers against other options to get the best deal for your situation)
I mean, it not like you can NOT get title insurance.  NOT having it, as its required by the ender, is not an option.
On the other hand, if you are paying all cash, then sure, there is no requirement that you have title insurance.  Its still worth hiring someone to do a thorough title search, and that will cost you about as much as title insurance (and title insurance companies do an excellent job of search the title - so its not necessarily a bad idea).  
But of all the scams or unnecessary cost to be racked up, title insurance is hardly the worst.
Anyway, i just put this here, because title insurance is one of the most understood elements of the escrow process.
TLDR: someone borrowing money to buy a house is requires to buy title insurance by the lender.  The borrower pays for this, but the beneficiary of the policy (should it ever need to be collected upon) is the lender.


p.s. yes, there are MANY charges in the Real Estate game that are a total racket.  Consumers simply do not know enough, and all too often get nickle and dimed for thousands in unnecessary fees.

No, i oppose the extreme left
*and* the extreme right.
thats why i am critical of not only the democrat party, but also the establishment republicans (for example, Bush was terrible, and his endless, unnecessary mid east wars have been a disaster.) 
Trump was the ONLY president in US history to be in favor of gay marriage from the day he took office.  Plus, look at his other policies, basically pretty moderate across the board ...and if you ignore his constant tweets (which seem to bother some people) and just look at his actual policies, then they are pretty much in line with the opinions of the American people.  
As just one example, Trump is in favor of legal immigration (we currently accept over 1 million legal immigrants every year, more than any other nation on earth - Trump says we should keep this overall number about the same).
Trump is opposed to illegal immigration.
This is the same with the average American (they are pro legal immigration, and against illegal immigration).  pretty common sense stuff, right?
And hey... the fact that Black and Latino employment is at the highest level in ALL of US history is pretty cool, too!
Anyway, i wasn't the one who brought up Trump, i was just replying to someone else who brought him up, and i was commenting mainly on how his presidency could be good for bitcoin.
Anyway, hope that hopes clarify a few things (especially for those in other countries or those who primarily are exposed to fake news).

Speaking as a realtor, selling a house for bitcoin is just about the stupidest thing that anyone could ever do.
Generally speaking it takes about 30 days for a house sale  to go from accepted offer to end of escrow (when the official record of ownership is transferred from one party to another).
Real Estate law is tilted towards protecting the buyer.  The way that real estate law works is that its very easy for a buyer to withdraw at almost any point (other than perhaps the last few days).  I won't get into every possibility, but there are endless loopholes and contingencies that allow a buyer to easily walk away with no penalty (and to get their full downpayment back).
On the other hand, as long as the buyer fulfills their obligations of the contract, such as getting the down payment in on time and other terms of the purchase offer, then its basically impossible for the seller to back out once they have accepted an offer.  Even if they try to, the seller can sue and make them sell (and in just about every case, the seller will win in court).
All of which is to say, the law is such that a buyer can almost always walk away at any point, but a seller has to sell once they accept an offer.
What does this mean?  Well if means that a seller can put multiple bitcoin offers on multiple houses (if the sellers are accepting bitcoin).
and then just wait on the properties that have accepted offers.
For example, in the case of a house for sale for $300K if bitcoin price plummets during those 30 days of escrow (lets say 33%), then the seller goes through with it, and the buyer gets it for essentially $200k.  If the house was actually worth $300k (more or less) then the buyer can just list it the next day for sale, for $300K and make $100K profit with almost no risk.
On the other hand, lets say bitcoin goes up 33% during those 30 days, then they buyer just pulls out no cost to them, and no loss at all (and the seller just wasted 30 days, perhaps turned down other offers, and now has to start trying to sell the house all over again).
So its a situation where ONLY the buyer can win, and where the seller can potentially greatly lose.
But you say... why not just peg the amount of bitcoin that you pay to the equivalent dollar amount on the day of the sale (not the day of the offer)?
Sure, you could do that, but then you're essentially just buying it based on dollar fiat value, and then just having the seller change the dollars for bitcoin before handing them over to you.  Why? whats the point?  if thats the plan, then the seller should just take the cash, and buy bitcoin with it themselves.
Anyway, there are other reasons why its a bad idea (if you are a seller) to list a house for sale, and accept a purchase offer in bitcoin... but the point is that its beyond stupid to list a huge for sale and accept offers in bitcoin (or any other crypto asset).
Its risky for the buyer if they do it too.  One other thing that a buyer might ask is why is the seller doing this? (and in this case taking a discount?)
The only real reason is that the seller might be trying to get someone to purchase right away, and have no delay in transfer of title (cause a buyer thinks they are "getting a deal).  And yes, there is the possibility of getting a transfer of ownership done is mere days (instead of the customary 15-30 days normally required).  But there a few things that EVERY buyer should do, such as have a basic inspection of the house, have the title check that its been properly filed and that there are no liens on the house, or other major issues with the property etc.  All that takes a few days here, and a few days there, and some dealing with the local government.  To just blindly buy a house that the seller is desperate to immediately unload, with zero inspections and title investigations is a red flag in and of itself.
So hey... do what you want, but its a bad deal (high risk and low chance of success deal) from every angle.

Yes, that is true.
Obviously the whole US House of Representatives impeachment hearings are a corrupt witch hunt (so its all kinda a bad joke and the final death throes of the evil democRAT party).
But, truth be told,  no one really cares about what the rotten-to-the-core democRATS do anymore.
The really interesting part will be when it moves to the US Senate, and they have the trial.  When that happens Trump can question ANY witness he likes (unlike the US House of Representaives hearing where the democRATS are censoring the truth, and ONLY allowing far left wing anti-Trump people to testify).
You see, once the Senate trial starts, thats when the real draining of the swamp can begin.  It's too early to tell for sure, but the Senate trial and its uncovering of the many misdeeds of the DemocRAT party AND the misdeeds of the establishment wing of the GOP, could be the dawning of a new age in America.
I knew Trump would be great, but I had no idea he would be able to do *so much good*.  Look at the endless attacks by the leftists and the globalists against him, and yet... he never stops fighting for the American people (besides did you ever wonder why the globalists attack him so much? and so insanely? its because Trump truly is a threat to their stranglehold over the levers of power).
Trump might not be the hero we thought we wanted, but he is the hero that we needed.
I believe he will prevail over the corrupt DC swamp, and besides... if they ever succeeded in their coup to remove him the American people would rise up in a new civil war.  I hope it never comes to that, but if it does, I am on the side of democracy and on  all the way.
Point being, this new day, and Trump's draining of the swamp could be a great new age for bitcoin AND America.

oh i agree 100%
we need to lock up not only hillary, but the rest of the swamp including comey, brennan, strozk, clapper and yes... most of all, obama.
they did the crime(s) now its time to drain the swamp and make them ALL pay.

Wow, this is WAAAAAY complex
But it kinda illustrates a good point.
If its possible for even tech savvy people to "lose" $30,000 worth of bitcoin
and the only way to get it back is super complex (and out of the reach of MOST people to be able to do on their own) 
then... as long as thats the case, then so-called "normies" will not want to use bitcoin.
And hey, can you blame them?
p.s. and that there is no trustworthy, reliable, place you can go to to resolve issues like this (or other bitcoin issues), is another problem with bitcoin and lightning.  Its all very intimidating and not understandable, except to people who are very tech aware, and thats only about 5% of the people.  The remaining 95% of us would rather just wait a few more years until someone invents a less insanely complex way to deal with bitcoin.
I mean, even me... I own bitcoin, about a year or so ago, I had a problem using my ledger wallet, and moving bitcoin in and out.  There is simply no one to help you (yes, they offer a totally unhelpful, slow, and clunky email tech support).  eventually I figured it out, but it took days and days of research, as well as having to ask strangers on reddit for advice.  Which is never anyone's first choice.  Spending days and days doing research just to deal with moving a few hundreds dollars worth of bitcoin onto a wallet?  that was a drag, unpleasant, and stressful.
And thats just a hardware wallet issue.  Lightning is difficult to deal with, too ...as are many of the other aspects.  its like when all there was for computers was DOS.  Regular people didnt want to use computers because it was so complex, and you had to learn so much to do even basic things.  
Eventually, in the case of early PCs and DOS, Steve Jobs just said fuck having to learn DOS to use a computer, and instead he made a Mac computer that was user freindly, and the masses came on board.
Until there is that sort of sea change with bitcoin, it will never achieve anything even close to universal adoption.

STILL going down
this sucks!

Yes, lots of people have lost crypto assets on coinbase.
Its a small minority, but it happens
The real problem is that IF you do have a problem, you can NOT get ahold of a human being.
They just make you do it all through email, and if they feel like it... they might not get back to you, or might not resolve it for months (or maybe never).
And the amount of work you have to do to get anything resolved is insane (believe me, i just went thought it, and it was a major pain).
In my case, i was able to get access back, but others i talked to lost access to their account, and never were able to get back in.
I mean, yes... there are government agencies you can ask for help, but seriously... if you need to get govt bureaucrats to help you get access to your account again, good luck!
It all comes down to the fact that there is no way to just talk to someone to solve even the simplest of problems (if you can't get access or if funds are missing or otherwise not accessible).  You are kinda screwed if you cant figure it out on your own (or if the screw up is on their end).
p.s. I know technically they have a phone number for tech support or help, but it you call it (EVERY time I tried), its just a recorded message telling you to email their "support team" (probably just one intern in a basement somewhere).

this is why the general public will not use
at least, not until this sort of thing is corrected, anyway.
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:31:17


energy costs will just keep going down, but its still going to cost (at least) a few thousand to mine each bitcoin, even using inexpensive power sources.  (plus there are hardware costs and other factors to price in)
all of which is to say, if bitcoin ever goes below 3K again it will be a problem
and if it gets below 1K again, it will be a BIG problem
and down into the hundreds? if it stays there, thats a game ender for BTC, i'm afraid
Lets hope that never happens

3.5 seems like the more likely possibility, of the two.

I can't answer many questions, as reddit has throttled my account to only being able to answer one question every 9 minutes (some weird thing that reddit does to "certain" users.  I dont even know why, I'm gonna guess its because i am a member of T_D ��‍♀️ but I cant prove anything.  Its not because of karma, as I am at a high positive karma rate, on all subs except r/politics).
but you ask an important tquestion, and as such, I will try my best to answer it.


and my answer is (quite simply) I dont know.
I do wish that he could/would get rid of all the corrupt big banker DC swamp dwellers.
Even more than that, I wish he would join up with Rand Paul and others and demand that the Federal Reserve be audited.
Lots of other things I wish, such as an even faster withdrawal from the endless mideast wars that idiot Bush started (and that Obama escalated).
So, yes I am glad that we are not doing things like the "too big too fail" TARP bailout of the corrupt bankers anymore (that both the democrat party AND the establishment Republicans voted to pass)
Additionally, in terms of actual policies, I am happy that Black and Latino unemployment are at their lowest levels in American history.
But, on some issues, I do disagree with Trump, or simply wished that he would be more effective or move faster.
But hey... all things considered, I do believe him to be directionally correct, and (in my personal opinion) I find his presidency to be much more desirable than *anyone* the democrats are offering up.
@_date: 2019-12-04 23:35:05
democrats want to destroy America, so i guess we'll just have to wait and see

i dont mind the goal of getting free
its just that i didnt expect bitcoin to lose 40% of the money that i put into it to get free.
its not free to get free.
in fact, it can be quite expensive.  for many of us, bitcoin is a HUGE money loser
oh well... thats the way it is.
all i can say is that buying and holding bitcoin has been a real drag, totally unpleasant, and depressing as i look at bitcoin's price everyday.
thats just my experience, and my opinion... i do know that there are others that have had a positive experience with bitcoin (i'm just not one of those people).

went totally over your head
typical Mooner
@_date: 2019-12-06 22:41:37
yes, youre probably right
but the fact that there is no way, on ANY level, to get a hold of coinbase when they lock you out, is why they suck
i mean, seriously coinbase... youre literally making billions of dollars, invest in a telephone, maybe?
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:16:03
yes, my bitcoin has gone down in value
and as such i am negative on bitcoin
really, is that so shocking to you?
I purchase an investment, I hold it for 2 years (and I am still HODLing)
At the end of two years, my investment is worth 40% less than what I paid for it?
but you think i should have a positive opinion of bitcoin just to appease you?
OK, Mooner
