I think a lot of BTC supporters like the idea of staying in BTC 100%. Never have to worry about fiat currency regs if you never go back into fiat.

In general the pressure you would have to not spend would be constrained only to the deflationary correction period.
Or to put it another way. You will try to maximize your purchasing power during deflation by not spending because if you hold it a little longer you might be able to purchase more (goods, services, etc.) later when the value of your money jumps up. 
And while you may spend less during deflation this doesn't mean your hairdresser will go poor (and you probably won't reduce the frequency of getting haircuts either). What will happen is when you go, you will pay less. And the hairdresser will gladly take less because during/after deflation, the value of your currency is greater. 
It's exactly the inverse of what Tucker described we do during inflationary corrections which is to spend quickly lest we lose our purchasing power by holding currency while its value drops. 
Simply, your spending (or saving) activity correlates to the value of the currency.

Why try to make them trustworthy when we can just use tools that minimize their influence?

The sooner we all can stay in Bitcoin the better.

At first I was like, "another Fed crackdown on BTC?!" then I was like, oh cool, keep it up!

You don't need a web connection to generate keys. You need a program. In most cases the program doing the work is on a web server and is sent to your browser for you. In this case the program is on the device and shoots the results directly to the embedded printer.

I've been waiting for someone to do this! I even designed a paper wallet template in anticipation. To any of you paper wallet makers in this thread, please, message me if you want the files. I'm curious to see how they'll print, and if you think the design/tones need tweaking.
My [Paper Wallet Design](
* Key strings stacked in even-numbered rows with grey columns to help readability.
* Send/receive codes separated by BTC logo
* Arrows to indicate send/receive.
