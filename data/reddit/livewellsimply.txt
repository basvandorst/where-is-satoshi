For most folks just coming into the crypto-currency mining space, Bitcoin mining will not be profitable. Just buy Bitcoins. If you want to mine, look into Litecoin mining: 
There's also a software/resource guide and full custom build guides at:

The only possible exception to this rule is if the Op switches to Scrypt based currency mining. This is what I would recommend, but not with a CPU or Nvidia hardware. AMD GPU's are the best option currently as shown in this guide:

Don't buy ASICs. If you want Bitcoins, buy them outright. If you want to mine, build a Litecoin mining rig like this:

What Isovolemia said. Click the transaction in Coinbase acct.

Why does that possibility scare you? Last I checked, rich nerds like Bill Gates are doing a lot for the earth's poorest.

I love the 'classic Mac' theme! :) Not sure if it will instill trust in visitors to your site though. I just stuck with the basic Wordpress theme on my website  and it seems to do the trick. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:28:48
Awesome! Be sure to post it here on the sub reddit. :) and many thanks!

Here's mine, but old school GPUs are now doing Litecoin mining after mining a mere 6 BTC earlier this year. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 17:29:44
I ordered, but not holding my breath with BFL. I spread the risk around by getting a few Jalapenos, building myself a few GPU rigs (like the ones at  and buying a few Bitcoin with Fiat. So far, the Fiat purchases and GPU rigs are the most profitable choices. If BFL hardware ever shows up, maybe I can sell it on eBay for a profit? Time will tell.

Bitcoin has a learning curve for most people who were taught from Kindergarten up what 'real' money is. Remember counting quarters, nickels and dimes in first grade? Anything outside that field of reality is going to take some time for people to understand. :)

Right now the markets are crazy, but I've had a good experience with Coinbase on days when US gov't hearings aren't moving the value of BTC 100's of dollars up and down in 30 seconds. :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:36:45
Litecoin and Worldcoin. Both have great developer community and some good fundamentals.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:07:50
Forget mining Bitcoin, due to ASIC arms race. Diversify your investment.  
- $4k in BTC (at under $600/ea)  
- $2k in LTC (at under $8/ea)  
- $2k in LTC mining ( and  If you're a gamer, you might already have a card or two that can be used for this.  
- $500 in 3rd alt-currency... do your research...  I like the under 30 second confirmation times of WorldCoin. 
Just my 2 satoshis based on 8 mo experience.  :)

Thanks for that summary. Makes sense. Market corrections are never a smooth ride. :)

It's ambiguous... "continue to monitor it with interest"
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:21:23
If you want to get into Bitcoin, just buy one or two using Coinbase or Bitstamp. If however you want to MINE Bitcoin, that is VERY risky right now and I honestly can't recommend it. If you want to get into mining crypto-currency, you can build yourself a GPU miner and mine Litecoin or any of the other Scrypt based alt-currencies using the guides here:

I was surprised how quick verification took. Sent docs and 20 minutes later was approved. Haven't done any trading yet, though.
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:22:26
I've used coinbase to move similar amounts. 
They are the best I've found in the US and have some serious investors behind them. At this point I would strongly recommend NOT using Mt.Gox with the issues people are having getting US cash out their trading accounts.

Scrypt coins like Litecoin, Worldcoin, etc can only be mined effectively with GPU hardware. Guide to build your own here: 
@_date: 2013-10-19 02:36:26
Who's buying on Gox? China? The spread is almost $20 now between Mt. Gox and "reality". :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:23:36
Yes, depending on your power costs, this may or may not work for you. Mine doubles as a space heater and makes about 3-4x the cost of my electric bill, more if the value goes up in the future (I mine and hold). Not too bad.

The ASIC's are coming, the ASIC's are coming. :) That chant has been bouncing around the internet for almost 12 months and GPU based rigs are still profitable. I'd say the 7950 is the best 'bang for your buck' right now. Check out the budget build at  and decide for yourself. If you're really cheap, you could get a desktop PC off Craigslist with a few PCI-e slots in it and throw in one or more 7950's. The 7xxx cards hold their value well. The one's I bought sell for around $40 more than I paid for them 2 months ago.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:34:17
Bitcoin mining isn't. But Litecoin mining is if you build yourself a GPU based rig like this: 
See also: 
There are several other alt-currencies being mined using GPU's as well. I've been running rigs since April this year, and they've paid for themselves already. Plus, the heat they generate is keeping my home warm this winter. :)
@_date: 2013-05-27 17:19:24
Check out the 'under $1,000' build guide here:   You could throw in another 7950 card on this build and it would net you around $300 worth of Bitcoin per month (at the current difficulty). Or buy the DSLR and shoot a few events to pay for it.

Forget mining BTC. If you want to mine, build a Litecoin mining rig. Directions here: 
Then you can either trade for Bitcoin or hold Litecoin for potential upside. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:50:02
It's a currency. Just keep 'em in BTC and spend them when you need something from a vendor that accepts Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-09 22:01:17
Why day trade when you can mine and use your time to do more interesting things than place bets on charts and data? Just thinking outloud :) Of course be free to do 'whatever floats your boat', but day trading BTC is very risky.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:05:07
This. The only crypto currency mining that is still profitable is Scrypt based mining. See  and the litecoin mining subreddit.

love it! "the resistance at $7..." what??? :)

GPU mining will cost you more in electricity than you will net in BTC returns. If you have AMD graphics cards, you can mine Litecoin or any other Scrypt based currency. Here's a list of them by marketcap: 
If you're looking to build yourself a GPU rig, here's a guide: 
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:23:54
Build yourself a simple 4 GPU rig, mine Scrypt currencies and convert to BTC. Don't bother mining BTC. If you have a bit of cash, buy BTC directly with some and build your mining rig with the rest. Something like this:

The most profitable Bitcoin mining ASIC's were the 1st batch of Avalons (hindsight is 20/20 as they say). That being said, I personally mine Bitcoin and Litecoin with graphics cards using a custom built rig. Full build guide here:  The advantages to graphics card mining are:
1. Graphics cards can be used for other purposes (gaming) vs single use FPGA's and ASIC's
2. Graphics cards can be used to mine 'scrypt' based currencies like Litecoin (there are currently no FPGA or ASIC equivalents in the Litecoin world).
3. Graphics cards can be re-sold if Bitcoin and/or Litecoin mining becomes unprofitable. In the 3 months I've been mining, I have made around 30% ROI on my hardware investment. I mine and hold, so that ROI could be much higher should Bitcoin value rise significantly in the future, which I anticipate it will. Hope this helps. And watch out for scammers! The Block Erupter USB miners are cool, but may never pay for themselves if/when the difficulty level rises significantly.

No backup of the wallet.dat file? Ouch! I really worry about the effect events like this will have on Bitcoin's reputation. The average person is so used to having FDIC insurance, Credit card fraud insurance, etc, etc. They are NOT prepared to be their own bank and all that this entails.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:58:29
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:38:35
 is a good place to start. It focuses on Litecoin mining, since Bitcoin mining is not profitable due to the 'arms race' of ASIC manufacturers. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:30:39
I think the op meant 25 BTC
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:42:31
This is a good thing. 700-900 was unsustainable speculation.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:25:47
If you want to mine, get into Scrypt mining by building yourself a GPU miner using one of the guides at 
Bitcoin mining is not profitable when compared with the alternative of directly exchanging fiat for BTC.

What other asset can claim the trinity of global currency, global asset and decentralized global payment network? Add to that, there is a finite limit of 21 million ever to be made for all 7+billion global inhabitants... yep, buy a few, and ignore the exchange rate for a year. I guarantee you'll have more value (in terms of fiat currency) than what you put in. :)

LOL! None of my friends are interested in buying bitcoins, but I got to build one of them a mining rig like this: 
They paid me $100 on top of hardware costs. So I got to have fun AND got paid. I was sober when I made the deal. Maybe that makes a difference? :)
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:18:00
Gold is actually a liability in some ways. It can be confiscated, is not easily portable due to security issues, and can't really be used as currency, particularly in the case of online markets. Will it still be used as a store of value? Sure. But Bitcoin has far more upside potential. Bitcoin's biggest liability is its age (5 years vs gold's several millenia) and the potential of a better digital/crypto currency replacing it some time in the future.
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:50:21
Thanks for the feedback folks. I'm with the 20% crowd with a long term view. I don't time the market or hang out on an exchange all day trying to squeeze extra value out of the volatility. :)

Spending 1600 on alt-coin mining hardware will net you a much faster and more certain return. Check out the build guides at
