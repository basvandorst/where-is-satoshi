In terms of total value transferred, not the amount of transactions it can handle

Maybe if you were able to examine evidence yourself instead of repeating whatever is considered allowable opinion in the part of the internet you're browsing you'd know that BU's """main supporter""" has tried trading their BTC for BTU but the core supporter who claimed that he would trade BTU for BTC but he hasn't replied

is antpool signalling for segwit on litecoin?
@_date: 2017-04-21 04:19:20
but can you buy coffee w/ it?

this always makes me laugh

not really all that covert at this point is it

did you even read the post?

Nodes are faked too easily, twitter votes are the way to go!

While SegWit and Unlimited are busy fighting each other Bitcoin is destroyed by altcoins

I don't think you understand, read my first post again. "cheaper fees" is not what he is complaining about.
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:24:50
He gets paid via fees (and block rewards). "cheaper fees" is not what he is complaining about, therefore not getting paid "another hundred million dollars" could not possibly be what he is complaining about. Calm down and try re-reading again
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:31:28
Why do you refuse to read what he is saying? He's not comparing post-segwit fees to pre-segwit fees, he's compering post-segwit fees sent from segwit addresses to post-segwit fees sent from non-segwit addresses. Calling other people "naive" or "communist" is not an argument.
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:46:12


Can't they just exchange it for monero/zcash, send them to a new address and exchange back?

I never said that this in an issue worth blocking segwit for, I said being againts giving segwit transactions a discount is NOT being againts low fees and you guys are putting words in his mouth

$50K is a pretty low reward for a worldwide attack

They take more bandwidth and storage, without the discount they would cost more than legacy transactions.
Btw just in case you still don't understand: Removing the discount would not increase Jihan's income (if we assume that the blocks are full)
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:05:07
Yes, but removing the discount does not increase his income
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:03:34
He's not saying "segwit will lower fees and that is unfair", he is saying that AFTER segwit is activated it's unfair that segwit transactions are given a discount over legacy transactions.
