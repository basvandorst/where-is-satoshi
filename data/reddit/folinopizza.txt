I think you should put 1-3 thousand in gold, silver, copper platinum. (buy actual coins. pre33 gold eagles and junk silver at your local coin shop or ebay. 1 thousand in google (or apple but fuck apple), then have some cash left over to use in jail. i'm sure you will want some cash while there.

You can still get the 20% bitcoin discount!
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:55:38

He was having dinner at my house. So he kinda had to go. funny thing is he lost 3-4 bucks overnight.... sucker
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:45:43
I will look into it
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:34:02
Don't worry about it.I guess my response was a bit harsh
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:48:33
yah i'm planing on doing something like this
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:45:36
yah. I could see myself doing this long term. I was thinking 5% maybe?
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:15:03
I would for the right price. I have a vacuum sealer and can freeze them -the pies are good warmed back up. Be the first person to buy wood fired pizza online with bitcoin. I will ship FedEx overnight in an insulated bag. the pie will still be frozen!
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:15:44
I love getting people to do shit for me...
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:10:09

After my bitcoin for pizza post last week got the  spot on the Subreddit: The local paper called and so did NBC news! gotta love free advertising. Now everyone is going to think that I sell pizza AND lsd/Ecstasy. Great intro! Thanks Bridget!
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:37:54
I would have to look into it. It would definitely be better to order more then one. I will try to figure out a good package that can keep something cold.
I will update soon.
You would still get the 20% Bitcoin discount tho!

[I made that sign out of a broken down cedar fence that use to surround Shelburne Farms. Took me like 2 weeks to do.](
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:09:06
If you want to use a password and confuse whoever is at the register you can use "Tippy Toe" or "Lemon Tree". Then go wide eyed and start nodding your head. 
Once there confused/scared just say "Buddy sent me over from reddit to order some pizza pie" I will most likely be stretching dough or upstairs in my office on Reddit checking on how many upvotes I have.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:19:09
I will go talk to them right now. only takes a few min to make a coinbase account. If you come buy pizza with bitcoin I will give you a 20% bitcoin discount PLUS a 30% Reddit discount!
50% off come on! 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:16:13
We need more people to accept bit coin. And more people to spend it. We can't make it a legitimate currency by just buying into a speculative bubble and hoarding fool
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:18:02
Your a fool and know nothing about marketing
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:19:13
I can actually get a copy of the security cameras and make a GIF of this. As long as it was still recording. Its a piece of shit guardian from costco so i will give this a 50% chance. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:41:49

Life is tough over here  We're cranking out pies 24/7. If you come try to get a pizza with bitcoin you will be miserable too with a 900 degree slotted pizza peel to the face

@_date: 2013-11-23 02:19:39
Yes. Only vacuum sealed frozen pies though. They are good heated up in the oven. 20 bucks for shipping
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:15:22
Mr. Jar lax tell it like it is, cuz you know I accept bitcoin at my biz. Some people might think its funny. Say that bitcoin aint even money. So I Show them how I trade and sell it up on Mt. Gox. Slice and dice’n the motherfuka stuff em straight into the pizza box.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:34:48
This is a good idea
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:26:42
