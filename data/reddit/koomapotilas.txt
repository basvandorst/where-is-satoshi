Poor management explains why many of the developing countries aren't really developing. But it doesn't explain why some states in the USA are permanent receivers of federal aid. They can't compete with currency devaluations. Improving the general productivity would require funds they don't have. Reducing wages would drive the work force away, create brain drain, reduce purchasing power, and lower the tax income.

If two countries are adhering to gold standard, it creates similar dynamic between them as euro does in EU or dollar in USA. The regions with high productivity are able to improve their productivity even further while regions with low productivity fall behind. The relative difference in productivity combined with common currency is the root of the problem. With common currency Greece won't ever catch up Germany. What little profit they make will go towards mandatory expenses such as loan payments. In the end the central governments in both EU and USA are forced to pump just enough money from rich regions to the poor ones to keep the food riots, separatist movements, and civil wars away.

The gold standard has a major downside. The global gold reserves tend to gravitate towards the rich countries with healthier economies and better productivity. In the end almost all gold belongs to the few strong economies while all the other are left with scraps. Those with lots of gold have more purchasing power and more money (as converted to gold) in circulation. The poor countries can't ever really rise out of poverty while the winners keep on winning.

You're absolutely right about productivity and the direction of money flow. Where our views differ is in unproductive countries ability to rise out of poverty. My argument is, that the unproductive regions (states, countries, etc.) won't be able to improve their productivity as fast as the already productive ones **IF they have a common currency**.
Lets say state A makes 6 dollars for every dollar they invest into their economy, and state B makes 5 dollars for the same investment. State A will be able to invest 3 dollars back to their economy while state B is able to invest only 2. These investments keep on improving both state's productivity, but state A's productivity improves faster that B's. The more time goes on, the wider the productivity gap between the states gets. There is little incentive for anyone to invest in state B as they get better productivity elsewhere. The richer state A will stay more highly productive because they are better equipped to further improve their productivity.
Now, if two countries have separate (fiat) currencies, we can very well see those productivity shifts you're describing. The unproductive country could devalue their currency, lure in foreign investors with cheap prices, and rise their productivity.

As a market instrument Bitcoin is closer to noble metals than fiat currency.

This is an excellent example of why every transaction has three participants; the buyer, the seller, and everyone else.

You can't plate connectors with Bitcoin. There will always be demand for noble metals. Of course asteroid mining could make most metals dirt cheap.

There is no failure. Only good moments to buy.
