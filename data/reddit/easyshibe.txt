Very good statement by Nicolas Cary. And nice having them showing the iPhone-Crash Videos.

SA is definitely one of the first countries in Africa to run with Bitcoins. But there is even more potential, not just for the 'developed' part of the community. It would be great seeing a monetary system without corruption and manipulation in those african countries. (e.g. zimbabwe)

Isn't the IP information which you can see on blockchain.info from the blockchain?

hmm. it helps to some degree, of course. but when bitcoin goes mainstream, i'm sure there will be also some insurances that will help cover riscs there

Nice one.

I think that's a true and really important statement concerning all cryptocurrencies.
The biggest problem of Bitcoin is not found in the protocol. It is people only seeing the dollar equivalent of an Bitcoin, rather than seeing the value directly in the currency.

Bad times for Bitcoin... 
But we'll be back. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:28:44


Isn't that exactly like the dollar? no intrinsic value.. (no value by itself)

Thanks for clearing this up.

Looks good. To make Bitcoin mainstream we need more of this Bitcoin-Hardware. :)

Thanks for the clarification.
He will love Bitcoin, cause of the great Blockchain, that even stores the IP address of every single transaction. ;)
