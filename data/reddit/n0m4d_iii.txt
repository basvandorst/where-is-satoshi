If you haven't yet, Daemon / Freedom(tm) by Daniel Suarez.
The audiobooks are also quite good.

What, just prosecute?  This is an anonymous currency.  We should be able to do better than that.

Gox's current story is that those BTC were created in Gox's DB, and did not actually exist.

No - please see:

*The hacker-attack on bitcoins will in my opinion have a very bad impact on the concept itself. Even if all the transactions will be reversed, people will get out of it in masses. Confidence and security, are musts for whatever we touch, especially when money is involved. You can’t have a compromised system. All in all, it’s a very interesting project, with typical anomalies of human behavioural finance, but in my humble opinion, one with no future as the lack of regulation, money laundering risks and many other hurdles will at some point kill the project.*
...obviously has some misconceptions about what's going on.

Ah, good - with the improved sound equipment, we can finally make out the guest not being interviewed.
Slowly but surely...

Not my product:
Mine's on order.  :)

I can barely make out his agenda...  No...  Wait...  Ah, there it is.

The guys running firstbits.com were discussing this as an additional feature, I believe.

Not quite -  would appear to be giving them a run.

Crippling embargo on alpaca socks?

Well, at least they're shutting up the "market is unstable" trolls...

* Enigma was, for all intensive porpoises, closed source.
* It was a polyalphabetic substitution cypher, with an exceptionally long period.
From that to Public key ECC is a wee bit of a stretch.

I will go as high as three dogs and a pinkie, but no higher.

So go fix it, or put up the bounty to fix it, or write your own interpretation that follows the protocol.
I've heard Gavin say in the past (paraphrasing) that Satoshi's strong point wasn't programming.

Easy tiger - just inserting another data point.

Note that this does not appear to be an attack against BTC - quick glance at the code - it locates and attempts to make off with the wallet.dat on a windows box.

Reports on SR are that phishers have been replacing the URL at various wikis with a link to a copycat site that will steal your username and password.

It's zero-sum if you're thinking of it as an asset.
Reframe it as a currency, and see what happens.
@_date: 2011-06-15 19:54:25
Code it or bounty for it.
@_date: 2011-06-28 22:38:36
It would appear that you are implying that some entity is going to plunk down and brute force everyone's private keys.
Bitcoin uses (from the protocol spec) secp256k1 -- haven't looked at the code for the key width, but if it were something absurdly small, it would be a heck of an oversight for something so otherwise lovingly crafted.
If you're worried about this, take it to the devs.  Otherwise, I'm calling troll attempting to move the market.

Ricardo López, is that you?
