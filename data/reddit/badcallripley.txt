Anyone who doesn't live under a rock with a working brain "believes in Bitcoin."  That doesn't mean anything.  Understanding that Bitcoin's first role is as a liberation tool.  It can't, and doesn't need to be, and therefore shouldn't try to be, the solution to everything.  Be as dynamic and as valuable as possible, but without compromising its reason for being invented, for being valuable, for being still.  Especially when the premises for betraying it are so weak.  Gift card technology, for example, has existed for decades, and allows for consolidating many transactions.  We have SegWit, and all the potential with it, at our doorstep, and yet still people are trying to convince us to let them destroy Bitcoin, as it's the only way they can.
Bitcoin is invaluable as is.  There's better reason to reduce block size limit than increase, and maybe than allow it to stay as high as 1mb.  The real issues facing Bitcoin are the points of centralization/corruption, such as exchanges, forums.  The lack of fungibility/privacy, or perhaps the understanding that it is absolutely required.  Any crypto that doesn't provide privacy/fungibility is a placeholder for its successor that will.
Let's have an "honest discussion" about the real need for Bitcoin, its enemies, and what it must be...  And what we lose forever if we lose sight of it.

Bitcoin as humanity's reserve CC is on borrowed time if anonymity/fungibility isn't addressed.  Insulating us from this type of disease is requisite to this experiment working.

You should be honest and explain that the alternative might come with phone calls of people demanding to know personal information, and that no one but the rightful owner can choose when their Bitcoin "account is closed".
