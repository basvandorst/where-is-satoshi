We used to be owned by the banks.  Now we merely are the middleman between them.

I work for Visa and am a bitcoin supporter.  People are quick to bash centralized systems without fully understanding how and why they are like that.  Visa offers services that Bitcoin currently cannot while abiding by strict laws.  A cutover to Bitcoin with its current infrastructure would be a disaster.  Don't assume we are just the bad guy.  We are totally looking into how blockchain can improve payments.  People just really need to understand how complicated our payments systems really are and all we do behind the scenes.  Bitcoin just isn't there yet, but provides some interesting new ways to view payments.

The only thing Bing is good for is searching for Google when it's unfortunately set as the default search.
@_date: 2014-01-21 02:42:44
I've always wanted to try one of those things.  Is that the kind where you like lean forward to speed up and lean back to brake?
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:48:04
Maybe check this website out?
If you do a google search, a few come up.  I haven't done any sports betting with btc, but I've used Bitoomba for blackjack/roulette and I had a pleasant experience.

I think people are smart enough to know bitcoin isn't stock in a company.  At least god I hope so.  It resembles stock because of how its traded.  The fluctuations can be tracked and analyzed in similar ways as stock is.  To say they don't share commonality is false.

It is childish what PayPal is attempting to do to stop bitcoin.  I deleted my PayPal account and will never use it again.  I've been spamming the hell out of their contact us with all sorts of hateful messages.  &gt;:)  Let PayPal burn to thr ground.
@_date: 2014-01-08 03:34:33
Man using bitcoin on a sketchy online gambling website...doesn't sound too smart.  Sorry to hear about that though. :/
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:23:49
I still agree with nate, you are comparing vastly different commodities.  I'd assume more people would want bitcoin than a used car.  It doesn't take any special sort of effort/person to sell bitcoin whereas with a car there is.  When considering bitcoin people have a relative idea of the price and that is independent of how work they want to put into selling it.  Unless you count holding bitcoin for a price rise as work, bitcoin is fairly effortless to get rid of.  I don't really see it going for much less than whatever its market price is.  I wouldn't even be surprised if it went for a good deal more because it bypasses the hassle of an exchange.
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:43:46
I agree.  There definitely are a lot of people who want volatility when what we really want is stability.  I guess I was missing the point.  Too many people do expect results in the way they expect from stocks.
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:40:17
I actually did think of that.  The actual auctions themselves bringing down the market price if they end up selling lower than expected.  You're right, you can't really be sure what will happen.

At least we can buy beer until midnight every day.

Also a side note:
Rewards also come from the interchange fee.  An interchange fee is the amount the merchant's acquiring bank pays the issuing bank for a transaction (around 2%). Visa, Mastercard, etc also take a very small cut of this fee and they set the interchange fees. This interchange fee is associated with the particular brand (Visa, Mastercard, etc) and type (signature, platinum, etc).  Cards with better rewards have higher interchange fees for the exact reason of paying for the rewards.
Edit: Also Walmart hates Visa because of interchange fees.  They pay a dirt low interchange fee and want to pay nothing.  They feel that their low prices are their way of giving back to the cardholder.  This is why you can't use Applepay at Walmart. :(

Where does that credited bitcoin come from..?
@_date: 2015-01-29 02:12:12
I have but unless I'm missing something what is actually making someone forfeit bitcoins to someone as in the case of fraud, etc.  And what if you can't identify this person?
Edit: and also it doesn't address credit at all
@_date: 2015-01-29 14:57:55
I don't know if you can call credit cards a "failed experiment."  Just because people don't know how to use them correctly doesn't mean they are a failure.  And central banks are not the ones "pouring money" into them.  It is people who do not know how to use credit that run up charges and pay insane interest that keep the business going.  And I don't know how you figure that credit cards are putting small banks out of business.  Small banks issue credit cards as well.  People need credit and that's unavoidable and people will always spend money they don't have.  Bitcoin is not going to solve that problem.
@_date: 2014-01-08 03:25:56
This is exactly my thought.  Spot on.

Nice is that on a piece of paper towel?
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:03:26
How many bitcoins can you get for them?
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:14:53
Does it really matter in the end?  It's not like the bitcoins will ever be taken away from you?  At least to my understanding.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:22:51
that's fine, more for the rest of us..buy em up guys
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:49:30
That's Reddit for ya.  Any good information will be pounded by pointless criticism.  Lol.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:08:34
I mean my first recommendation would be to backpack Europe, but for some reason you are avoiding the euro...?  Out of experience, I had the most amount of fun doing that for a few months.  You just stay in hostels and travel by train from place to place.  If you are trying to get the most bang for your buck, try backpacking South America.  That is of course at the cost of living conditions.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:37:55
Agreed.  The more bitcoins the Chinese get rid of, the better.  They'll want back in when prices are higher. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:45:08
This is pretty on point.  Just think about it, if bitcoin does succeed, China is going to want back in.  Imagine how that will affect prices... :o
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:42:37
Yes, that's part of the reason the market is so volatile.  I've always thought what is stopping a billionaire from buying bitcoins just from a collector's point of view.  Like hey I have a ton of pointless money I'll buy as much of this currency at whatever price and see what happens!  If you had that kind of money, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:28:30
You could use mtgox or bitstamp.  I believe bitstamp requires you electronically send them a copy of your license and proof of residency.  For mtgox I think you actually have to mail physically copies of that same stuff to Japan.  I'd suggest bitstamp because coinbase has a close relationship to bitstamp and mtgox has been having many issues lately.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:46:29
Sure it is.  People are just way too caught up in trying to make quick money off a, currently, volatile market.  Bitcoin still has a very promising future and when this crazy crash is over hopefully more people will be able to realize that.
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:51:12
I'm no expert, but I'd assume so.  I'd guess that all miners are working on the same blocks and whoever happens to get it, gets it.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:11:17
Maybe look into a service like bitstamp or coinbase.  They are easy to get setup quickly, but take a little bit to get fully verified to instant trade.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:59:56
If bitcoin becomes as big as everyone predicts, it is still plenty early man.  You got to think long-term.  The money you invest should be money you don't need access to for a long time.  It's like a savings plan.  That way even if you have to cash out early, it's all money that you never had.  But I honestly think it has a future, both financially and as a digital currency.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:16:52
Lol I still see a flow chart as a visual but we can get arrogantly literal...
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:27:32
This doesn't confirm anything.  This article was written with a negative bias towards bitcoins.  It doesn't mention the fact that more and more businesses are opening up to bitcoin.  Bitcoin is bigger than what the Chinese government has to say about it.  If people show the world that they want to use bitcoin, it will have a future and the government will have no choice but to adapt around it.  It requires a little optimism, which is why the market hasn't burned to a crash after the Chinese government ordeal.  I personally think bitcoin has a legit future.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:46:38
Comparing it to slavery is going too far, that only offends people.  Banks are definitely threatened by bitcoin because they don't know how to control it.  I personally think it's a good thing because the people should ultimately control money not central government.  I know many don't share this belief, but I hope there will be a strong enough backing to make bitcoin a major global currency.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:57:20
Right now it is mostly an investment based off a speculative market.  There are not enough businesses to make bitcoin a viable alternate currency on its own quite yet.  We are in the investment stage where we need to show businesses we are dedicated to bitcoins by buying as many as possible, thus raising the price.  There are pretty much two types of investors: short-term and long-term.  The short-term are day traders and people mostly interested in some quick cash.  The long-term are people who actually understand bitcoin and see its future potential (and of course, want to make cash).  If bitcoin wants to survive as a currency, we need more big e-commerce websites to open up to it.  Once more people understand it and see the benefit of using it in their daily lives, I could see its popularity growing massively.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:23:46
To each their own.  I still think it's a little more new user friendly compared to a article packed with computer science jargon.
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:48:39
The process of mining puts new bitcoins in to circulation.  It is an incentive for miners to forfeit large amounts of computing power.  And yes it is a race for the first miner to happen upon the right combination.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:35:20
Hilarious man.  I like to have optimism when it comes to new technology that can change the world.  You aren't convincing anyone.  Some of us are committed for the long run and actually believe bitcoin has future use.  It's funny that you care enough to troll about it.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:15:58
I think the bitcoin price is done going down for now.  It appears to be hovering around a stable price while slowly increasing in value.  I think on Tuesday the price will be higher than it is right now, by how much, who knows.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:10:14
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:30:38
It is a complex situation.  Right now buying and hoarding bitcoins will increase the demand which will raise its price.  However, that is not sustainable and like you said people need to exchange it for good and services for it to be a stable currency.  But as of now it is more of a speculative market and for a future to develop, people need to buy buy buy bitcoins even if they aren't using them quite yet.

I couldn't agree more.  The number of available bitcoins is going down and the number of businesses accepting bitcoins is going up.  It doesn't take a genius to do the math here.  More people just need to get educated on bitcoin and buy some!
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:46:20
I'm skeptical about these other tools you speak of.  The picture is just more engaging in my opinion.  So what if it's old, it's new to many others.  I'm just trying to get the information out there.  I don't see how posting the same article under 50 different titles is any better.
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:50:27
It's normal for any kind of gambling.  I get over it by rationalizing that my decision was the best for the given time.  If you play the what-if game you'll never make any decisions and then regret it in the end anyways.  Best to have confidence in your decisions and be okay with the outcome regardless.
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:37:08
Just like any gamble, you have to know what you are getting into.  The fact you sold around $700 shows you don't know enough about the market to be investing your entire life's savings!  I don't know what kind of money situation you are in now, but gambling on bitcoin is probably not your best option.  You should never invest money you are not willing to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:35:47
Never claimed I discovered it.  I just know there's a lot of people joining the community and have never seen it.  I know plenty of these people personally.  I don't know what good a post is to a new user if it was made a year ago.  I'm just trying to help people and it is sad to see how people get off on criticizing mundane details...
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:45:33
Stupid article.  I could make arguments all day about why fiat money makes no sense and why gold's value is based off of nothing.
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:17:40
$200 is enough to trade with.  The transaction fees I'm familiar with are between .5-1% so it's not bad.  And as far as it being worth it, it depends how familiar you are with the market and day trading.  It's a gamble and you got to be willing to accept big fluctuations.  I don't know much about MultiBit in particular though.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:11:45
Yeah there is really no reason to.  It's not like having a bunch of addresses is bad or anything.

Nothing is ever going to guarantee you those kinds of profits without huge risk.  You knew you were risking every dollar you put into bitcoin.  It's a long-term investment and it doesn't look like bitcoin is crashing to the ground quite yet.  And honestly the only direction bitcoin is going, as far as usability, is up (if you can think outside China).  A big upwards spike is bound to happen and a lot of us know this and we keep bitcoin from ever plummeting to nothing.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:15:44
Just want to make a couple points.  Tulips can't be split up like bitcoins can be.  Tulips don't help you do anything.  The same can be said about gold bars.  I have zero use for gold bars except selling them for money and that's the same argument people make against bitcoin.  Bitcoin has potential to change how we use money whereas tulips don't do anything and gold bars don't do anything.
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:41:35
There's always someone who has to disagree with everything...  Bitcoin isn't a metal coin, so why understand it as one.  Lol.  I can also understand a computer as random pieces of metal, but that won't get me very far...
