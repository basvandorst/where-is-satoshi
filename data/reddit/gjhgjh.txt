Actually, you are wrong. Money does go missing from banks but you, the customer, never know about it. That is what FDIC insurance is all about. Bank robberies still happen. Just check the news. What happens when that money isn't recovered? The amount in your back account doesn't drop. The bank requests a replacement for the stolen money from the FDIC.
But where does that money come from? The FDIC didn't recover the stolen money. The stolen money is still missing. The FDIC issues newly printed money from the US treasury to the bank to replace the stolen. Bitcoin does not have a mechanism to do this.
Once upon a time US currency was very much like Bitcoin in this aspect. It was tied to gold. The amount of printed dollars always equaled the amount of gold in reserve at Fort Knox. When the US went off the gold standard it made printing more money than there is gold to back it a reality. It also made institutions like the FDIC possible.
bitcoin, much like the US dollar when it was on the gold standard, can't just be replaced by printing up more bitcoin. There just isn't a mechanism for replacing bitcoin with bitcoin.
 
tl;dr, The US dollar isn't a zero sum currency. bitcoin is a zero sum currency. That's a very important and often misunderstood difference.

Maybe they just fake the ping times the same way that they faked the 1969 moon landing.

But what is the ping time like?

As long as they are working on different blocks it shouldn't matter. In fact, even if they are working on the same block as long as they are in different pool it shouldn't matter. So I guess the fix is to group by pool, which this chart already does. Is there a way for more than one pool to be working on the same block in coordinated manner so that one pool's work isn't duplicated in the other pool? A sort of pool of pools.

So basically bitcoin is no different than any other new technology. For example cell phones were around for a couple of decades but didn't become a must have item until they were made small enough to fit in a pocket. Tablets were around long before the iPad but it took Apple making a tablet that anyone could use to make them a common household item.
I suppose for bitcoin to become popular it will take someone coming up with a way to make it as easy to use as a cash or a debit card. Right now there are just too many steps for the average person to go through to make it worth while for them to use.

I remember the same argument about this new thing called the Internet happening on BBS's around the world in the mid to late 90's. It's a good thing that the modem tax turned out to be a hoax.

That was worded poorly. I really shouldn't post comment at 3am. As long as they aren't working on the same copy of the same block. Does that make better sense? Basically a situation where you have a pool of pools.

As long as bitcoin continues to be the most profitable SHA-256 coin to mine it is going to attract more miners and the difficulty is going to rise.
There are plenty of other SHA-256 coins. A few have been more profitable than bitcoin but only for a short time. I wonder how the value of bitcoin would be affected if another SHA-256 coin where to become more profitable to mine than bitcoin for an extendeed period of time. Would the value drop and not recover or would it rise and fall with the rising and falling difficulty as people move in to and out of bitcoin mining or will the value of bitcoin be unaffected.

Can you explain this proof of ownership better? For example how would I go about using colored coins to prove that I owned my house in a way that no one else would be able to make a colored coin proving that they own my house.

These two actions are not mutually exclusive.

You really don't know? If this wasn't the first Internet hoax it was certainly one of the first. Just search "[modem tax]( and you'll get pages upon pages of relevant links!

just assuming that the main reason that people use GHash.io is the fee could end up being a costly mistake. Zero fee pools aren't unique to GHash.io. If I were you I'd poll Ghash.io users to find out why they use GHash.io instead of some other zero fee pool. Also don't discount their other website cex.io. GHash.io and cex.io have a unified login essentially making the two websites one big website.

This is technically true only because the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 paid directly from the Treasury and not via the FDIC. It is true that the FDIC covers looses thru earning in US treasury securities.
Unfortunately, Bitcoin can't do this because the protocol isn't designed to just simply print more currency. The closest thing that some altcoins do is PoS but PoS isn't nearly the same thing as earning interest.

What people seem to be forgetting or it may be because they are ignorant about Bitcoin is that Mt Gox is not a bitcoin bank. As far as I know there are no bitcoin banks nor is there a need for a bitcoin bank. However there is need for money exchanges and that is what Mt Gox is. It is a currency exchange. The bitcoin they held for their customers was not being lent out. It wasn't earning interest. They aren't offering checking or savings account services. They are a money exchange.
An entity like Mt Gox can't be regulated or insured like a bank. It would make absolutely no sense! It would be like requiring a foreign money exchange to follow banking regulation rules instead of exchange regulation rules. This is because Mt Gox is an exchange, it isn't a bank!
Anyone who was using Mt Gox as a bank was frankly being stupid with their bitcoin. I'm very sorry that some people got burned by Mt Gox but a little education and a healthy dose of caution goes a long way.
 
tl;dr, Mt Gox is a money exchange. It isn't a bank.

There isn't much detail in the video. It says "by coloring a bitcoin you turn it into a token that represents anything you want to trade ... instead of sending cash through the bitcoin network you can trade anything you want."
I'm not a bitcoin expert but I've never heard of anyone sending cash money through the bitcoin network. They have always sent bitcoins through the bitcoin network and the receiver then has to sell the bitcoins if they want cash money.
One problem that I see is what I'm going to call the Brooklyn Bridge scenario. If I am understanding this correctly I can color a bitcoin and turn it in to a token that represents the Brooklyn Bridge. I can then transfer that colored bitcoin token to someone else and they will now own the Brooklyn Bridge? That sounds fishy to me.
The other problem is duplication. What if I color 10 bitcoins to represent the deed for the Brooklyn Bridge. The I sell the 10 colored coins to 10 different people. Now 10 people all believe that they own the Brooklyn bridge.
Please don't misunderstand me. Colored coins are an interesting concept but I just can't see a useful real world application for it.

Hi! There is about 30 min left of Tuesday for me. I'll be sad to see it go. I was really enjoying this one.
