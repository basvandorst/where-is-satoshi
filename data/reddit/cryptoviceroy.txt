But not for the people they're really after here.
If you're really laundering money you could quite easily swap your dirty BTC for cash (and then launder it).
Or just launder the BTC directly  through some front company.

Makes sense for OSM to just support lightning.

People would mix the coins regardless and the US would end up backing themselves into a corner.
The US would effectively starve itself of BTC liquidity as a growing % of bitcoins become illegal to use in the US.

Not to mention government's abusing that power.

Maybe, but given the risky nature of crypto, I doubt you'll find many insurers who would go anywhere near it

We've come a *long* way since then.
Back then Bitcoin was rarely ever mentioned in the media, and if it was, it was consigned to a single paragraph in an article about Silk Road.
Very few online or retail stores accepted bitcoin, and you could count the number of bitcoin ATMs on your fingers.
Now we have articles about bitcoin in *printed* newspapers, segments on talk shows, documentaries and crypto YT channels.
Stores (especially online) popping up left and right. Integration with major platforms (Shopify etc). Even KFC joined the bandwagon.

haha there's a lot of weird emjois for fairly good reason.
The unicode standard is supposed to be a collection of every character or symbol in use in written language.
The weird emojis are mostly from early 2000s Japanese phones, Windows Wingding fonts etc.

Any ad that isn't static text or a static image is intrusive.
I appreciate you're trying to run a website which costs money, but you also need to appreciate that user's might not want 3rd party ad networks like Google tracking and harvesting their data.

That's the reality though, I'd guess anywhere from 80%+ of webmasters don't have any kind of shell access.

Looks like he's using some forks as indicators of downtime (I wouldn't quite call it downtime though, blocks were still being mined so it was still up and running imo).
But perhaps you could say it was downtime as any transaction submitted or blocks mined on the "bad chains" would have been undone shortly after.
In 2010 we had the [Value overflow incident](
Then in 2013 there was a bug that caused an [unexpected fork]( that caused all sorts of mayhem.

Just thought I'd also suggest some privacy centric alternatives for people who'd rather keep their emails away from prying eyes.
Google Mail is cheap for what it is and a good service.
But then you have to be ok with their abysmal track record on user privacy.
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:14:16
I agree this is an incredibly positive move

The bitcoin wallet client called "bitcoin core"
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:05:56
Alternatively ProtonMail and other email providers that respect your privacy.
Or if you're feeling techy, you could run your own mail server (and have full control over the emails stored on disk)
That way you don't have Google scanning through and harvesting your emails enmasse.

Well that's the Government's fault.
If they implemented a sensible drug policy they could have regulated the site and taxed it.
But they'd rather the 2nd biggest global market after oil was left in the hands of organized crime.

NSa making bitcoin i think is a little dubious.
But the NSA *tracking* and performing *deep analysis* of the blockchain is almost certainly happening *right now*.
If you monitor every address, and associate the address with a person through other meta data, you can track every payment in the network.

Banks aren't necessarily a bad thing.
We just don't want powerful third parties giving our financial records to the state and messing with the money supply.
Bitcoin gives you an opt-out.

USBs are super unreliable for safe storage. They break pretty easily and don't last longer than a few years.
Don't store your wallet on a USB. 
You'll be pissed as hell when you go to plug it in and find the drive has failed, and your coins are forever lost.
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:27:15
To be honest, there's no way of actually knowing whether a wallet has been lost, or whether the owner is just a really good hodler.
Just because the coins haven't been moved in 5+ years, doesn't mean someone doesn't still have the private key.
It's very difficult to estimate how many coins have actually been "lost".
Any number is literally just a wild guess.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:30:26


I'd say it was easier.
No verifying your identity, no other BS. 
Just click buy on MtGox and you were done.

That's a considerable way off yet.
We need an entire economy built around BTC before that could happen.

It's not as big of a deal as you might think. Cash in and of itself offers no escrow settlement whatsoever.
Send someone some cash, a cheque or a bank transfer and there's no guarentee you'll get a refund.
That why we use third party services built on top of cash, to offer Escrow. Amazon, Ebay, Paypal, Visa, Mastercard and so on.
The same is true of bitcoin, Escrow service will be built (and already have been built) on top of Bitcoin.

To know that it's the *valid* blockchain, and not some bogus blockchain fed to you by an attacker.


SPV nodes have so far proved elusive.
Even in the early days of Bitcoin, Satoshi expected them to become available "in the future".
Many have tried to make one, no-one has succeeded yet. (This is a big part of why Bitcoin's block limit hasn't been raised)
Until then we can't make assumptions based on technology that may or may not be available at some undetermined point in the future.
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:41:48
Theoretically, given enough time, all coins could potentially be lost and if that were to happen it would probably be the end of bitcoin.
But the amount of BTC in circulation doesn't really matter, the network could theoretically still work with less than 1 BTC left.

Goddammit. The one time I make a transaction and the mempool starts exploding.
Fee too low and trezor doesn't support RBF, looks like I'm stuck for a while.

A ban would be hilarious.
It would be as effective as trying to ban the sun from rising

Yeah the fees really need to be fixed, otherwise there's no real incentive.
I'd be more than happy to run an LN node, but the fees you earn are so low it's just not worth the effort.

But what's concerning is the concerted effort by companies to deplatform them.
Patreon removed them and that in and of itself wouldn't be too bad.
But it starts getting a little suspicious when we see competitors (Subscribestar) getting deplatformed from the global financial system, because they didn't bend the knee and also deplatform them.
As this goes on it's becoming more and more apparent it was the cartel of Visa, MasterCard and PayPal who forced companies to deplatform them (under the threat of themselves being deplatformed for non compliance).

Only the price, which in the scheme of things is a trivial side note.
They can't change the protocol. Can't mint more coins. Can't take funds from a wallet without a private key. Can't freeze a wallet. Can't block transactions.
