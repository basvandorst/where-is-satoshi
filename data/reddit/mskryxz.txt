Very easy way to save a decent chunk of money when buying Starbucks. The parents will love this since its already  easy enough for them to use Airbitz but now combined with Fold they can save whenever they buy some coffee.
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:19:34
I used it and it works well.
If you buy Starbucks and you use bitcoin, you should take advantage of 20% discount unless you like throwing money away and making Starbucks richer.
I view it as doing my part increasing the transactions done daily and actually using my bitcoin while saving myself 20%.
Some of you may not like Starbucks, myself incuded but I'm sure you have that wife or girlfriend, or kids, or friend that drags you into buying Starbucks with them. This is a perfect use case scenario to save money on places you don't like going to! haha.

You can also Buy/Sell bitcoin inside Airbitz with Glidera and also get 20% off Starbucks or up to 10% off Target directly inside the app through their partner Fold.

Almost 4,000 listings with good pics and the wallet is secure open source rolling addresses etc.

Mycelium and Airbitz are my top favorite wallets here. Good to see them rolling this out.

I saw that video. Bitcoin Fluid Dispenser very awesome. Highly suggest anyone who has not seen it to check it out.

airbitz just keeps getting better and better!
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:22:04
Use Airbitz. 
You can thank me later.

Actually wrote a little review covering some of the wallets I use on bitcointalk, anyhow I just copied and pasted my experience with mobile wallets that I have been using (breadwallet actually messaged me but I haven't played around with that yet and will review them soon). While Mycelium holds the reputation of being the best wallet and most reliable, but Airbitz is getting up there. You can actually do stuff and browse pictures of businesses when you're bored:
I recommend both the Airbitz and Mycelium wallets if you are new. Airbitz has a built in directory, looks beautiful, and has an easy interface for new people. Mycelium on the other hand is very reliable. I've been using Mycelium since early last year and they just recently upgraded to HD 2.0 wallet with additional features. Mycelium also lets you connect with people to buy and sell bitcoins locally with peer reviews. 
Then you have the Blockchain wallet which is alright but still somewhat confusing and buggy especially after the new upgrade and look. The directory is not as complete and doesn't have pictures either but gets the job done. I primarily use Blockchain Wallet just to keep track of all my addresses with their watch address list. They are one of the oldest wallets that have been around but other wallets are starting to get ahead of them in other areas.
Other than those 3 mentioned above, I also use Coinbase, Hive, and the original bitcoin wallet for pocket change. Coinbase is a given, I need an app to transfer to and from my other wallets after I buy my bitcoins. Hive is alright as well but I see them being too similar to Mycelium and end up using Mycelium more often. The original bitcoin wallet I use every now and then just to test sends or leave pocket change on. I probably have under 20 transactions with the original bitcoin wallet so really not much to say for that one.
I find myself using Mycelium the most but increasingly on Airbitz just because it looks appealing to the eye. I also believe they are the only one, or are one of a few wallets that support BLE transfer so you don't need to scan QR Codes or paste long addresses.
Lastly, the Airbitz and Mycelium videos sold me:
 - airbitz
 - mycelium
If anyone else has a wallet that I missed please feel free to shoot me some recommendations so I can download it myself especially if you think they are better than Airbitz or Mycelium since those are my hot ones right now.

My income is 100% in bitcoin since the beginning of this year with a bitcoin start up company in CA. 
That is all I would like to disclose.

Airbitz wallet @ 2:32!!

Airbitz. 
If bitcoin is the Swiss Bank in your pocket, then Airbitz is the Swiss Pocket knife of bitcoin. It can do a little bit of everything but surprisingly well.
1) No Bans and Privacy - Buy/Sell bitcoins inside the App and not be worried about getting banned if you spend it on gambling compared to Coinbase. This is something people need to learn. When you buy bitcoins from Coinbase or Circle, those coins are on THEIR WEB wallet. When you send it off from Coinbase --&gt; Gambling site, yes you will be banned. However, with Airbitz it works just like it would if you were to buy coins from Coinbase --&gt; Mycelium/Airbitz --&gt; Gambling. Not affected. Or in this case, just buy it inside Airbitz in 1 step and your good to go without having to transfer. 
2) Actual Use Cases to Save Money - 20% off Starbucks and 10% off Target, all day everyday. (Well for the most part when they are in stock usually sells out fast) - In action here 
I personally hate Starbucks. But what can I do if the wifey or my mom wants  me to grab them a frappucino? I'll get it for them but f no am I paying full price. Target is a small discount but its better than nothing and I haven't seen this type of feature anywhere else.
3) If you do taxes or just want to calculate it gains/losses at the time of sale or be able to import into QB then Airbitz wins here too. Your accountant will love you for this one.
4) For the average Joe or the 60+ year old person, this is the easiest to onboard compared to the others. I used to onboard people with Mycelium but for old people/ non techies, it is a huge cluster fuck period. They need something that's as close as a bank app with just user name password and to be able to log in on a diff device if they lose their phone. They usually will not take the time to write down the 12 words. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Mycelium and it was my first wallet. It appeals to a lot of old schoolers and I totally loved their Mycelium video back in the day (This one  I'm just speaking from my experience with older/non techies. Lastly, most users onboarded didn't even know where to get bitcoin or did not want the hassle of connecting to an exchange. With Airbitz at least they can use the directory and easily find an ATM nearby.
5) If Airbitz goes out of business, Airbitz will continue working and you will still be able to send/receive bitcoin because of its decentralized nature, even with no one working on it. 
Other wallets that I use - Copay for multisig, Trezor for hardware wallet.
I'd like to try Ledger tho and heard good things from breadwallet but it is iOS only and I have android.
I think main thing we can all agree on here tho is that everyone will tell you to not keep bitcoins on an online web wallet.

Airbitz is the wallet that is most like a bank wallet app.
Very easy to use for a beginner.

check out airbitz, they have a nice directory and the mobile wallet has a directory on it as well
@_date: 2015-08-13 21:26:01
I want my invite!
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:24:11
As others have said, that is way too much information for them to grasp.
Mycelium isn't gonna be an easy wallet to use either with the long addresses.
Start with wallets and show em an easy one, maybe start with Airbitz and show them their demo vid: 
Then give them about $5 or so and have them practice sending/receiving payments. If they can log into a bank online then they can handle this easily.
@_date: 2016-09-05 17:27:58
Even if they somehow had the answers to the recovery questions they would also need the token from the email to reset the password.
The token by itself and no answers cannot reset password.
The answers without the token also cannot reset the password.
The user with both the answers and the token from the email can.

@_date: 2017-10-16 20:40:54
You can sign up with other exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini ec. 
Store bitcoins on Airbitz for the decentralized security and privacy and then when the time comes to sell, send those coins to the exchange and make your sell there if the bank is supported.
If it isn't, keep looking around for other exchanges and/or consider using Bitcoin ATM's or Localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2015-04-11 21:47:52
Airbitz should be on there!

Great review and video. The first part shows how easy it is to set up and shows off how easy it to send with bluetooth. The next part highlights the technical side and how it works. I dig the video and thanks for making this!

@_date: 2015-09-30 18:49:19
Obviously not great reporting since they still highlight bitcoin like it's still 2013. But otherwise good publicity for bitcoin, Airbitz, and SD3D Printing. 
One thing that I do like though is that it is nice to see bitcoin companies actually pay their employees in bitcoin instead of USD. It's annoying when we see bitcoin products go for sale and they only sell it for dollars and not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-25 02:54:18
Yeah same.

They had their chance to buy bitcoin dirt cheap!
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:58:07
I suggest Airbitz. It's by far the most user friendly wallet that even a grandma would get.
@_date: 2015-03-08 19:23:37
Highly suggest Airbitz. Can't go wrong with them.
I used to use Mycelium back in 2013. I changed to using Airbitz as my primary mobile wallet.
Video is a bit outdated but it is now much better. Has BLE (can send without scanning) and more.
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:46:23
Wow congrats. I bought the small piece. Once I get more funds I hope to buy a few large pieces. The art is very beautiful and it's bitcoin!
Thanks again for sharing that piece. If I haven't seen it I probably would not have known about it. It's one of the only pieces that I actually bought within 10 minutes of seeing it!!
Have a good day!
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:36:25

Chain Restaurants and Stores that accept btc (Walmart, Carls jr etc)
Chain Gym accepts (24 hour or la fitness)
Bank integration (go to atm, send btc to my atm, money appears as cash in my bank account)
Open Bazaar or some decentralized ebay 
Some kind of decentralized gambling site that automatically pays out the winner without a 3rd party or middle man.
Chain of Gas stations that accept - chevron etc
Uber - able to pay for rides with btc
Airbnb - able to rent out places with btc

Airbitz has the best directory out there.
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:58:57
This should be appropriate:
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:43:24
You won't be forever locked out.
If you lost your device that had 2FA enabled and then bought a new phone to try to access your old account, you would simply log in and do a reset request.
The reset request sends out a notification to the device that you lost with 2FA to seek approval. However, if there is no response for 7 days, it will reset and you will now be able to log in with your new device.
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2015-10-12 20:23:16

@_date: 2015-03-19 16:27:58
I highly suggest checking out Airbitz. I used to be pro Mycelium and now use Airbitz as my main wallet. I am confident and trust Airbitz enough that I store a decent amount in there (Although not a lot that I would sleep over on). 
I recommend using Airbitz for iOS or Android and sticking to Trezor or traditional paper wallets for cold storage security for the bulk of your coins. Hope this helps!
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:15:36
Awesome stuff!

Fight Club, Tyler Durden, and Bitcoin. Good read. :)
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:05:39
Airbitz for sure on Android (coming from Mycelium here). Airbitz is secure to use as a hot wallet that I can sleep fine at night with a decent amount in there. 
For long term storage, definitely use paper wallets or Trezor.

It's crazy to see how fast things develop in the bitcoin space. I am very happy to see that Airbitz is innovating ways bitcoiners can pay without having to scan a QR code. I wonder what is next to come after that!
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:37:17
It's been mentioned already but I will say it again, Airbitz does all of this already. You can even export the csv file. + It has a lot of other features making it my wallet of choice.
I've heard about BTC in November of 2012. The wallet I used to use back in those days were Multibit or Mycelium. Now I am 100% Airbitz for my daily transaction stuff. Otherwise, the rest of my funds I keep in cold storage (combination of paper wallets + Trezor).
So if you're old school like me, go with Airbitz you can't go wrong there.
