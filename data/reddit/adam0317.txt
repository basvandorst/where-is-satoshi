That's not too bad a profit. If I was to have say *1.12 do you think I would do any better?

I am in the United Kingdom, I want to sell online and I'm not interested in the meeting up of people.

From what I can tell we use an escrow to ensure each parties money is safe.
I think you open a trade with me, my BTC are automatically sent to escrow, you send money to escrow and then when both are confirmed the money/BTC is released.
Thank you

Also I know the minimum balance is 0.4btc, does this include if I have 0.5btc, sell 0.3btc so I have 0.2 left.   Can I not trade with this? Or do I just need 0.4 to list the listing?

Thanks very much for your reply. This is exactly what I was looking for.
Does anyone else have anything else to say?

I am probably going to do bank transfer. Is this what you are asking?
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:54:22
But you don't have to meet the people!

I have just checked and you are correct, although I'm sure if something bad happened Local bitcoins would back the buyer 
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:15:19
Thanks the most will probably be 0.5 btc, not huge amounts

Also quick question, is there any way to minimise loss if the price you sell it at is lower than the price you buy it at. Is there some way to buy it off an exchange and then sell it immediately to the person buying it on localcbitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:33:24
Probably bitstamp

I have tried looking round the internet for it but there doesn't seem to be much about it.

Do you make a decent amount of money, if you are happy to answer that.
