BTC is dying. All the new adopters are realising the price is over cooked and the technical limitations can't be overcome. 
 
The new money is flocking to alt coins. 
It's been a slaughter out there today.

she's going to pop at 12k dollars.

They tried to solve scaling solution by creating bitcoin cash

Bears make money. Bulls make money. Little piggies get slaughtered. Lot of hogs getting butchered at the moment, going to be plenty of bacon on the table this Cryptmas.

The butcher has come to slaughter the hogs for Christmas. We need bacon on the table. Welcome to the killing fields. Stay inside, the butcher is still thirsty for blood.

EURO price is tanking hard and fast.

She's going to pop at 12k and 10keuro. Take your profits and get ready to buy back in.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:11:18
Salty. How much have you lost dear?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:31:00
It's out of control. Great viewing watching this thing blow through the walls. I don't know where it's going to stop.

This is a genocide gentlemen. Total wipe out. Hope some of ye followed my advice the other day and got off the streets before the Bitcoin Butcher arrived in town.
Too dangerous to jump back in yet. I'll wait till Cryptmas has passed and reassess. Lot of wise men are holding gold, frankincense and mir this year and dumping bitcoin! Meanwhile, the shepherds are leading more blind sheep to the slaughter organised by bitcoin jesus. Judas In wall Street is cashing out for 30 pieces of silver.

Dumped my BTC guys.  37% ROI. No point holding to see the profits wiped out. Nothing wrong with taking a bit of green.
Something big is coming. Get out while you can.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:47
Bubble has popped guys. Pyramid  (scheme) is slowly starting to crumble. Nothing wrong with taking some green now while you're still in profit. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:18:49
she's bhursting lads.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:15:31
this one has already popped pal. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:10
coinbase is down. :/
we're done lads
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:57
ot's over and I can't even log in to flog what i have left

Just a question about something (which perhaps is my lack of knowledge)....but most people on here seem to be buying bitcoin so that they can make massive profits and then dump it and have all their money in fiat currency. Will the entire system not crash if that is the goal of most of these people.For example if bitcoin jumped to 100k in the morning, 90% of users would probably sell and count their profits in dollars and then the whole bitcoin system is finished. anyone able to explain how I'm incorrect about this.
