To all of you out there who say that nobody’s going to spend something that increases in value? Here’s proof you’re wrong. 
When people get free money from something, the first thing they do is go spend that free money. 
That’s why a deflationary currency can actually work as a currency. 
They may not spend it today, but if they start off with $100 today, and they have $120 in a month? Guess where the $20 is going? And then they’ll do it again when it becomes $120 again.
It’s a process that takes time, and value will increase over time with a deflationary currency. So people will be incentivized to buy that thing so they can have an increase in money later. 
They don’t get an increase in money so they can stare at it for the rest of their lives. They take that increase and they spend it. So in time, there’s a huge spending incentive with bitcoin.
Every single person that says bitcoin shouldn’t be used as a currency because it increases in value?  You’re not getting something very very basic.

While there may be some crazies on both sides of this debate, the rational ones ive spoken to honestly seem to have no problem with lightning network.  Including Roger.  
The problem is apparently the disabling of the base layer while the second layer is still unfinished and not ready for production. And taking years and years to finish. 
You don’t have to raise blocks to an absurdly high level to keep it functional.
We could completely eliminate the Bitcoin Cash project if we just make the base layer low-fee functional again. Both layers working, in conjunction, makes the most sense to me. 
SW was one approach, but I don’t think it’s going to be sufficient on the next bull run. 
And no, I don’t support the bitcoin cash project. I support the elimination of the bitcoin cash project by having rational, reasonable scaling on both layers.
(I hope this is OK to say in this sub)

Define “as secure”.  Is a 16 character password really necessary for complete and total security compared to a 15 character password? 
If you raise the block size limit to 16 MB, and the total node count drops from 10,000 to 8143, is bitcoin now centralized and insecure?  
Or do you think maybe the most important thing is that the product remains functional, cheap, and free to onboard, and slightly fewer nodes doesn’t actually make bitcoin centralized nor insecure?
Honest question.

Not to be a pessimist, but I believe 90% of the OG population cashed out last January. And when I read the cryptocurrency sub, all I see are traders and noobs. 
Remember when everyone called you an idiot if you traded crypto? Now literally everyone’s talking about TA. 
Everyone. That’s all anyone ever talks about. 
No one ever brings up the technology, the use case, or the change BTC was supposed to make for the world. It’s a narrative that has completely gone silent everywhere. 
Why is this relevant?  Just that I don’t really agree the community is becoming more fun to follow. I loved the passion and the direction and the mission we all had three years ago. Those people got rich and probably exited. Dumbasses like us didn’t cash out at the peak maybe. I don’t know. But I feel we are few and far between.
I don’t even hear Andreas speaking anymore. And I couldn’t get him out of my face from 2012-2017. I know he’s out there, but nobody’s talking about his speeches anymore. 
Remember the Canadian Senate hearing? Remember how everyone of us was frothing at the mouth with excitement? Where is that? I don’t see it anywhere anymore.

When you get a yearly bonus, do you save it, or go pay some bills with it?   
When people are given more money to work with than they started out with, they’re going to spend more.
Deflationary currency encourages spending. Period.

People shout for $1500 BTC because they want to get BTC cheap for themselves. So they are slimy little worms that hope if they keep spreading FUD everywhere, the price will tank and they will benefit themselves financially.
If they keep telling everyone it’s going to $1500, maybe it will, and they get more BTC for themselves.

We have an established style, font, and design for the Bitcoin symbol.  It’s not smart to introduce a completely different font and style for a Satoshi.

The S with the single or double lines through the middle are best and add uniformity to the symbolism of bitcoin monetary units.

False.  If you have $20 today, and $25 next month from that same stash, are you not incentivized to buy something? Everybody will be. Including you.

@_date: 2018-10-17 16:16:51


No it absolutely does not. Once again why are you people talking when you don’t know what you’re talking about? 
The IRS has classified crypto currency as personal property. 
That’s the entire reason this loophole currently exists. As soon as the IRS reclassifies crypto, then you will not be able to go to Puerto Rico with existing holdings and cash it out to tax-free.
This is accurate information verified with the tax authority of Puerto Rico BDO. Please call them and check for yourself.
@_date: 2018-10-17 16:15:23
This is false. 
You are either unaware, or disregarding the fact that [cryptocurrency is classified by the IRS as personal property](  And as such, under the laws of Puerto Rico tax authority, personal property is not taxable even if it was acquired prior to becoming a resident. 
This is the loophole he is referring to, and it is accurate. 
In fact the vast majority of those who have moved down to Puerto Rico are existing holders. Most of them continue trading in and out their existing holdings to fully domesticate it to Puerto Rico “just in case“ prior to any changes. 
**Until the IRS reclassifies crypto currency as a taxable asset, you absolutely can cash out existing holdings prior to Puerto Rico, upon becoming a resident and fulfilling all requirements.**
I understand that your viewpoint is the commonly held one, but you don’t have all the information unfortunately. 
I would strongly suggest you speak to Giovanni Mendez who is the Crypto Attorney with the Puerto Rican Tax Authority BDO.  They are the ones who actually wrote the laws about this issue, and can confirm it to be accurate
Edit:  yeah downvote me.  Welcome to Reddit where provable facts are down voted by idiots who don’t know what they’re talking about.

It’s about understanding the law.  Please contact the people that actually wrote the tax law for Puerto Rico if you don’t believe me.
Giovanni Mendez is the person you need to speak to. He’s mentioned in the Crypto Utopia New York Times article for this very reason. He handles all the biggest names in crypto who are moving down there. 
Every single word out of my mouth came from his mouth.  I can DM you his number and you can text him directly and get a response pretty quickly.
@_date: 2018-10-17 16:19:21
Unfortunately this is one of those threads where I’m going to have to advise you to ignore all the advice you’ve heard. 
My suggestion is you contact Giovanni Mendez with the Puerto Rico BDO tax authority. He will give you correct information on this issue, because they actually wrote the laws we are discussing right now. 
And as it stands today, while crypto currency is still classified as personal property by the IRS, you can move there and cash out pre-existing holdings at 0% tax. 
This opportunity will not last forever, as they do expect the IRS to reclassify crypto sometime in the near future. This is why everybody rushed down to Puerto Rico last calendar year. 
I recommend you do not listen to random people on the Internet regarding this issue.
@_date: 2018-10-17 16:37:58


False.  


Translation:   Your advice is the ultra conservative method and what ppl should do if they’re paranoid and going to ignore clear laws.  
You aren’t claiming the other method is wrong. It’s just more aggressive.  
You don’t get to just ignore the fact that it’s personal property, and personal property is not taxable in Puerto Rico. How you can consider that bad advice is beyond me. It’s the law.

What? Totally wrong.
0% tax kicks in immediately.  In fact it kicks in retroactively to January 1 of whatever year you get approved within, even if you get approved in October.
And until crypto currency has been reclassified as a taxable commodity or some other taxable form than just “personal property”, crypto purchased prior to moving to Puerto Rico falls underneath the 0% tax rule. 
Most people upon arriving in Puerto Rico sell and buy back their holdings to domesticate it to Puerto Rico from that point forward officially.  But you absolutely can move to Puerto Rico and include your existing holdings as 0% taxable if you cash out.

1). Children are [starving to death]( because all the money has been removed from their parents bank accounts by the Venezuelan govt. These people need an economy they can onboard to that is immune to govt seizure.  Enter Bitcoin. The entire reason it was made. 
How did babies dying become a joke in Bitcoin circles? Because somebody you don’t like mentioned it?
2) If Bitcoin is not usable by these people because they make dollars a day in income, then Bitcoin has outpriced 5 billion suffering humans.  This is a serious problem.  Simply raising the limit a bit keeps the base layer functional and free to onboard.  This matters.  
I’m thankful the Core Devs understood this and created SegWit.  A small bump, but it helps.  I’m happy Coinbase and Gemini have finally enabled it.  
Lightning Network is going to be amazing for micro transactions by users who don’t mind a custodial setting.  But the freedom to use it non-custodial is the entire point of Bitcoin. 
A lot of people are passionate about Bitcoin changing the world for the better. These people aren’t naïve idiots. Their opinion is quite literally what this entire movement was about for the first seven years. Nobody expects the block size to be so big that it causes centralization risks to bitcoin.

Where's your scientific paper proving he's wrong?   Im also still waiting for your scientific paper showing the exact node count that correlates to 2mb, 4mb, and 8mb block size increases, so that your gross assumption that these increases result in "a risk to decentralization" can finally be backed up with something other than blatant extraction from derrière.


Actually that's exactly what you're using to support the claim that block size increases will cause security damage to Bitcoin.  Random numbers based on irrational assumption.   I'd like to see proof that 8MB will destroy bitcoin.  Otherwise, the claim shouldn't be made.

It’s not digital gold.  It’s a worldwide peer to peer currency.  A financial system separate from “The State”.  And over time will become a store of value.  
But it is primarily a currency.  Separation of Money and State. 
Digital Gold rubs me the wrong way.  Gold is a rock. At least you can do things with it.  
Digital gold is useless.  Digital currency is useful and has value via its utility. There is no utility with fake electronic gold. Just my opinion.

What amazes me is that you think actually keeping Bitcoin usable for the poorest 6 billion in the world is a “bad thing”. 
Can you explain that to me? Because that’s really what this is all about. 
I’ve come to the conclusion that people who want painfully small blocks don’t really care about poor people.  That’s the only conclusion I can come to. Because the only difference between the two, is that your version doesn’t actually work for them.  Which makes up 70% of the world population. 
I support layer two scaling as an adjunct. But it’s ridiculous to intentionally limit bitcoin so much that it’s unusable by 70% of the planet. We don’t have to scale to a ridiculous level and cause centralization. There are shades of gray.
So why do you ridicule people who want bitcoin to be affordable for those who need it most?   Let’s drop all the drama and the childish name-calling, and talk about what’s really on the table.

Actually guys like you should leave this project and go experiment with your "Layer 2 only" approach on some other coin.  Bitcoin is not your guinea pig.  And the reverse adoption and massive market-dominance-loss we're seeing due to the poor decisions being made are evidence that something is wrong with your approach.  Not everyone else's.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:52:40


That is the entire problem with this debate.   The "bigger downsides" are being completely ignored.  Loss of adoption, usability, and Bitcoin's entire Raison D'Etre seem to take a back seat to "as many nodes as possible".
But this rationale makes zero sense.  This isn't binary.  One minute BTC is decentralized and the next minute it's centralized.  There is a sliding scale of node counts correlated with MB block size.  
At the end of the day, the proper rationale is this:  Open Bitcoin up to as much usability, affordability and adoption as possible without sacrificing security.   
Period.   And we don't have to sacrifice security at all.  That's the whole point.   You slowly raise the block size limit to encourage adoption, affordability and usability, while monitoring the node counts.

@_date: 2019-04-09 18:18:44
Usage and utility is what incentivizes new users to buy it, thereby increasing the value.  
It’s insanity to assert that a useless electronic rock has more value than a worldwide currency used by 7 billion people.  
Think about where the price would go if everyone was using it as a currency, and there are only 21 million of them in existence?
Doing nothing with it, or disabling its ability to be used, disincentivizes the general public from buying it, or even caring that it exists.
This causes BTC market dominance to drop by 50%, as we have already seen.  
What price do you think Bitcoin would be at today if it had been allowed to continue with widespread merchant adoption and 20-something’s all over the world were buying it to use in daily life?

Please provide your documentation showing at exactly what MB block size causes this result.  I have yet to see the numbers from anyone. 
At exactly what blocks size does bitcoin become centralized?
If we have 10,000 nodes at 1MB....
And 9,145 nodes at 4 MB.... is bitcoin now centralized and in danger of being attacked?
What if we bump the block size limit to 8 MB and we have 7,045 nodes?
I can’t believe we even have this conversation when the numbers aren’t discussed. It seems to be just everyone’s blind opinion. 
Provide some proof that Bitcoin is centralized at “X“ mb block size and we can simply avoid going that high.  
And in the meantime we can benefit the network, the users, the industry, and pretty much everyone by raising it enough to keep it cheap and functional.  Usability matters.  Adoption matters.  
This is so obviously common sense that I can’t believe I’m having to type it.
A password with 11 characters is not “relevantly” more secure than one with 10.  After a certain number of characters there’s sufficient security.  
Something is seriously wrong here if people aren’t even willing to slowly, incrementally increase the block size and monitor the effects.

The entire argument against SW in the first place a couple years ago, was that it would take forever for the industry to support it. Because it requires re-writing systems. Whereas raising block size would’ve been immediately supported by the entire industry.

The most reasonable viewpoint to me is to carefully scale both L1 and L2 to keep both nearly free and fast.  And this is entirely possible to do without any negatives.  
Nobody expects unreasonable scaling on L1.   And L2 can help offload tx’s for those willing to use custodial-based centralized services for micro-transactions, etc.  
It’s a balancing act. You don’t completely kill one, and pour everything onto the other. In either direction.

There’s an obvious disconnect in the minds of the technically-inclined around here. 
You focus on security, code, and technicals, to the detriment of usability, affordability and most importantly:  the purpose of the Bitcoin invention in the first place.  Financial sovereignty for everyone. 
When “everyone” includes 5 billion people who can’t afford to onboard to LN, you’ve created a problem.  Not solved one. 
This discussion is not just a technical discussion. It’s a humanitarian discussion. 
The single biggest priority for Bitcoin should be people.  It is inappropriate for anyone to assert that Bitcoin “should be expensive”. 
Eliminating that “spam“ you keep talking about also eliminates 80% of the worlds population, using it for real transactions. 
Marginal increases in the block size DO NOT automatically translate to centralization of nodes. Nobody’s expecting the block size to go unreasonably high. 
**A balancing act between L1 and L2 scaling and keeping both free/cheap to onboard, is the most obvious, common sense approach.** 
We need to keep bitcoin usable for everyone.
If you’re going to change bitcoin into something that only rich people can use, you have changed it into something that has no semblance to the original.

You are pretending that banks don’t do anything except lend. Nevertheless, there will be lending platforms on block chain tech in the future. 
When people say “be your own bank”, they’re not referring to loans necessarily.   They’re referring to everything else banks do which bitcoin can now facilitate.

Actually I’ve been really looking into this lately. And there’s blame on both sides. 
There is a strong perception that LN has killed bitcoins ability to onboard the 6 billion poorest in the world for free. Because it costs money to open and close channels. 
The outrage is to be expected because if 90% of the worlds population can’t on board for free, then 90% of the worlds population can’t use bitcoin. This means that bitcoin’s entire purpose has gone down the toilet. And meanwhile you’ve got guys like Samson Mow saying retarded shit like “Bitcoin isnt for poor people“.
However, it’s a misunderstanding due to lack of information. In fact bitcoin * is * for poor people, and LN proponents are building for that.
I learned this week that wallets that are installed on smartphones can have their own channels that thousands of users could use. This would effectively allow the 6 billion poorest in the world to participate in bitcoin through lightning.
So what’s the disconnect? 
In my opinion, coders aren’t great communicators. They write code. They don’t do marketing and education, or PR. 
So weve got a highly technical community here who doesn’t care much about those who aren’t technical.  But then we’ve also got 99% of the human population.... that isn’t technical... and isn’t going to understand this stuff unless it’s explained to them in layman‘s terms.
There’s a lot of well-meaning individuals in the BCH camp who simply have misconceptions. Not necessarily any orchestrated misinformation campaigns. Nobody wants bitcoin to not work. They think you guys want to cripple bitcoin. And you guys think they want to cripple bitcoin. 
Neither of you do. We’re just not communicating effectively.

Why do you speak when you don’t know what you’re talking about? I’ve been through the last three. 
Allow me to inform you of how this actually goes
Hype, anticipation, and excitement start building end of this year.  Pricing-in begins roughly 4 months ahead of time (Jan 2020), with a justified amount of excitement and euphoria flying around. 
To say “nothing happens” when the day comes is complete nonsense. It’s the biggest event in crypto around the world.  
People will be having major Halving parties in major cities everywhere.  The price itself will spike even further, well past what the pricing-in brought us. 
After the Halving, within a few weeks, the price will correct.  The correction will last a few weeks to a few months. And it won’t be severe or painful at all. We will be significantly higher than we are right now.
But the initial pricing-in Dec 2019(?) will mark the end of this bear market, regardless of what else is going on in the industry. 
Roughly 6- 10 months after the halving, the upward price pressure of the reduced supply will start to take effect. 
That’s when you’ll start to see the massive price increases that come from each Halving. Let’s just put it this way: by Feb/Mar 2021, there are going to be some very wealthy people here.

I can’t stress enough how important it is for the industry to start adopting lightning network into their systems immediately. 
In fact I’m going to create a thread about this shortly. There needs to be an industrywide push for this now.
Wallets could start opening their own channels/nodes, so that using bitcoin doesn’t cost everyone $10. 
There’s no reason for that to happen with every single individual user.. Obviously. This is something wallet providers can do.
Most importantly this will enable bitcoin to once again reach the poorest in the world rather than only those who can afford it.  Not addressing this means out-pricing the 6 billion poorest in the world. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 01:17:56

“There is no proof”. 
Every single financial advisor in the world will tell you that a ten-year timeframe is an accurate way to determine the performance of an investment. 
So you do have proof.

@_date: 2019-01-28 00:54:43
Here’s my concern with that. And it’s been my concern with bitcoin for many years: Bitcoin doesn’t have a marketing team. So we “hope” that the world discovers, figures out, and learns through ... osmosis ... basically. Passive diffusion from high density to low density. 
This kind of learning / discovery ends up taking decades. Whereas information campaigns educating and speaking in layman’s terms, can accelerate things massively. 
This isn’t something that’s ever really been done with bitcoin. People don’t really bother. And I believe that’s to the detriment of the technology and speed of adoption. 
We had a bitcoin foundation and everybody got all shitty about it because it was a centralized entity. Even though they never did anything I found inappropriate at all. 
But something like that would be incredibly helpful for being a conduit of information, education, and PR.

BitPay has over 100,000 brick and mortar and online merchants that accept bitcoin. And that’s just 1 crypto merchant processor.  I see from your post history that you are an anti-crypto troll. Stop trying so hard. And inform yourself a little more.

We are not going to $4000. 
We’ve already tested $5800-$6200, at least 10 times over the last four months. 
We have bottomed out. 
This chart bubble/crash looks literally identical to the last two or three we went through.  So now we go sideways with little ups and downs for the next 12 months.  Not lower.  
Bitcoin halving will get priced in starting December 2019 pushing us past ATH. And 2020 will be a great year overall price wise.  
It takes about 6 - 8 months for the reduced supply of new coins to have an upward price pressure effect. So by the time December 2020 rolls around, things will be looking pretty outstanding. 
I agree with you that $250,000 probably isn’t feasible, but the last four halvings brought us something like 16x, 12x, and 8x. 
So a 4x to $80,000 seems feasible.

All the intelligent people were banned. The only thing left are noobs that have no clue what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2019-02-04 07:22:08


Completely false. Bitcoin’s value comes from its utility. From using it. 
It’s a value transfer system. **Use it** to transfer value. **Use it** in commerce. **Buy things** with it. **Send value** to others with it.
That’s what makes it superior to gold. That’s what makes it superior to a useless store of value.
Bitcoin was meant to be spent. Spend it.

You might want to familiarize yourself with Vitaliks position on BCH before you speak again:
And on his opinion of Rogers viewpoint:
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:44:37


No it’s not. He wasn’t talking about understanding the lines of code. 
He was talking about understanding the purpose, capabilities, and potential innovations that can come because of the technology. 
It creates a much deeper understanding of what you’re investing in, and I can vouch that it puts you VERY at ease during bear markets because you know what’s coming.  
Understanding bitcoin is something you’d get from one of Andreas Antonopoulos speeches.  It doesn’t have to go deeper than that. But 99% of people currently investing in it that I talk to dont even know the tech at all.  
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:39:34
I’m never a party pooper with stuff like this but the only times I’ve ever permanently lost bitcoins is when mistakes were made in moving them. 
I think this is a horrible idea where the benefits do not outweigh the risks.  And the people suggesting this is a good idea are lacking an awareness of some basic things. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:41:17
This is why we need bitcoin to actually be usable immediately.  Not in months or years from now.

You didn’t take any profits at the peak?  Balls of steel.

This is the correlation / causation that is relevant.  Not hash adjustments.  
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:49:33
I agree.  Bitcoin was supposed to be a payment system.  
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:25:01
No it’s not.  
Quite literally this system does not need permission to work. That’s why it’s networks are decentralized and cannot be shut down. 
All you’re talking about is **limiting** its ability to spread to **certain areas** through **certain means**.
That’s not banning it.  And it hardly makes it “basically dead”.  
The whole point is that it flows around these things like water. That’s what you’re not getting. It may take longer. But you can’t stop people from freely using something that nobody can control centrally. 
That’s why this meme is 100% correct. 
You have a very simplistic view of the world if you think the government controls every single nook and cranny of where money flows. 
You also seem to think there’s one government in the world.  
There are hundreds of other countries. Guess what that means? One countries rules will have zero effect on anothers.
Guess what that means? The technology continues to grow wherever it can route around and flow freely.

I like the positivity!   Was thinking of down voting this thread due to the endless barrage of negativity but this is actually an interesting way for the mining industry to reshuffle and give new players an opportunity to onboard.  
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:21:09
Yeah.  Honestly it’s very concerning.  This sub used to be about adoption.  Companies doing new things with bitcoin.  New infrastructure going up.  New use cases. 
Used to be full of talk about changing the world.  Andreas Antonopoulos speeches linked here, giving people goose bumps and reminding them of what Bitcoin was created to do.  
Talk about disrupting Banking.  Talk about helping the poorest free themselves from corrupt governments.  
Now there’s almost none of it.  I see almost zero mention of any of this.  The passion and meaningful purpose we all had seems to be 100% gone.  
All we have are noobs here joking about price memes, and threads full of strange pro-bank sentiment that goes in-responded-to by anyone.  It’s honestly weird as fuck and should be VERY concerning to people.   
The narrative of a cash transaction system for the poorest in the world is what inspired the price to ever rise in the first place. If we lose this, we better think hard about whether Bitcoin can sustain its value.  
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:38:56
False. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:26:26
Yeah so he’s completely wrong then.  Bitcoin is not mined slower.  Long term.  So that entire pint goes out the window.   It’s always every 10 minutes.  
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:44:42
Bitcoin is divisible, and as 1 coin becomes more valuable, the pricing will become smaller subsets of 1 coin.  
There is no correlation the between ability to use it as a currency and how many whole bitcoins exist. 
The entire bitcoin commerce system could be run with 1 bitcoin.  You’d just have to increase the # of subdivisions.  
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:51:49
Simply put the rationale is that while things are still volatile, you spend and replace. And those who sell things with BTC immediately convert to cash. Or if they are believers in the technology they hold onto it. 
But over time, the rationale is that the system will grow so large that stability will take hold. A larger number of users/spenders, results in a bigger pool of that is more difficult to disrupt. Every new currency commodity had volatility in the beginning.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:53:09
There’s an obvious conflict of interest here when the people with the keys to the repository are on the payroll of a company that stands to make a profit off the system. The fact that you don’t grasp this is weird.  And yes, trust becomes an issue when a centralized company has influence over a project in any capacity. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:40:50
Wow.  What insane mental gymnastics.
Increased usage results in increased adoption. Increased infrastructure.  Increased growth.  
Throwing a rock into a bathtub causes a much bigger disturbance than throwing a rock into an ocean.  
Doing nothing but holding BTC keeps it a bathtub.  
Usage grows it into an ocean.   With increased users comes increased stability.   Increased size. 
This was a big part of Andreas a Antonopoulos speeches from 2012-2106 before the narrative changed.

Oh look.  After 9 years, Litecoin still not doing anything new, unique, or innovative on its own.   
Still a BTC Cuck coin.

He’s a nut case that has been around here for years saying the same stuff. He’s right about the importance of spending but like many, he doesn’t have a grip on the reality of others.

With all due respect. It’s one of the stupidest ideas anyone has ever come up with. 
The only time I have ever lost coins is when I have moved them. And I am probably one of the most experienced users in this ecosystem when it comes to cold storage. I’m definitely not new.
Crypto is not to a level of ease-of-use where every single participant can just start moving their stuff around.  It takes a lot of careful steps and one wrong move can be disastrous. The percent of people that are going to screw something up and lose their tokens, will be massive. 
You need to be able to think outside your tiny little world of 6 inches around your own head. Not everybody knows what you know. Not everybody is as technically inclined as you. You need a better picture of the reality you live in, so people like me don’t have to explain the obvious to you.

This request from the community (and bitcoin industry) has been summarily rejected by the core developers multiple times. It’s important to ascertain whether you feel this adversely affects Bitcoins chances of success or not. You seem to be an intelligent person so I’ll let you handle that.

This would infuriate me.   
Rest assured these same people will be strangely quiet when things turn around, as they have 100x before.  
But then you’ll be considered a jerk to rub it in their faces over and over.  
I hope you’ll do it anyway.  
Send them article screen caps relentlessly when that happens.  
In fact why don’t you start sending them positive article screen caps right now and say nothing?  Just to show them that they are cherry picking their news. 
Here’s one:

Have you seen a true distributed network map? 
Here is a [hub spoke system]( 
Here is a [distributed network]( system. 
Which does the diagram above look most like?
I would wonder what those 6 very obvious massive hubs are in the picture. 
My genuine concern is whether or not something like that is going to continue form, for those that have the most resources, the most money, and therefore the most ability to funnel transactions.
Literally every system known to mankind eventually centralizes over time if it’s incentivized to do so. This is why the bitcoin block chain itself was unique. 
Is there any incentive in place to encourage the splitting up of these hubs and spokes? Just because there are a million tiny ones doesn’t mean there aren’t going to be massive ones like we already see forming. 
And they will continue to get bigger. Long-term, these are the types of centralized entities that get slapped with regulations and money transmitter/KYC/AML control by governments.
So what fail safe precautions are in place to constantly split up these hubs that could one day maybe even be owned by Chase and Wells Fargo?
