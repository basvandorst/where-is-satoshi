We do a few sales letters for customers now(I just haven't added that to the order system yet), those have been done on as need basis.
I have been sending thank you notes, cards and letters for my entire 15 year sales career. They really do make that extra push to keep you top of mind much longer.
@_date: 2015-04-14 11:44:29
We haven't yet, 99%of our customers are businesses sending thank you card to customers after a sale.
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:32:32
Hah you're right! I didn't look at pricing last night on my phone.
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:05:25
Thanks Natalia,
I believe in making a business accessible for all customers. Any bitcoins I do make will be kept minus costs, and used for marketing and expansion inside the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:04:22
I'll just drop this here. It's not perfect, but it should help.
@_date: 2015-04-14 10:28:06
I've never seen it. I get asked a lot though.
@_date: 2015-04-14 10:27:40
All the forms are secure, when we pushed the new site I forgot to enable the gyros redirect though thanks.
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:02:30
That is your bitcoin address, sorry it's not well written. 
You will get a request from coinbase (me) after you hit submit to pay for the card.
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:05:18
Unfortunately we are currently working with a credit based system when you order, so I have to associate that payment with an account. I am working with coinbase right now to setup and account free form similar to our order now page.
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:31:43
I completely understand it's not going to be a huge segment of my customers, but ever since I decided to start an online business I knew was going to accept bitcoin, and use the profits inside the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:26:12
Not yet, but our next version will have some API integration.
@_date: 2015-04-14 14:01:08
If you really want to I will add it as a feature just for you.
@_date: 2015-04-14 10:51:04
That looks really interesting. I'll check it out when I get to the office.
@_date: 2015-04-14 14:58:06
Sorry, I forgot to mention, since we use jotform for our no account option, you do have to sign up for an account to use bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 15:45:50
Sorry, none of our cards have anything that leads back to us (I put my sticker in my sample cards sent to people who request them).

here's a couple pictures of the standard card we send.
@_date: 2015-04-14 06:28:35
To use bitcoins you have to create an accoubt(our simple form hasn't been setup yet)

It's a limitation of the tools we have available.

I would say a good portion of retail transactions the  merchants never even touch the credit card anymore. Heck we take credit card payments over the phone.

This is awesome, here is an upvote, I have no bitcoins to tip you.
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:25:00
We're working on a solution for that right now. I know several other people are trying to do the same thing. 
A large problem is charge backs and ensuring the vendors get paid without buyers refuting the charges later.
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:40:39
You're not liable for it, but every person that uses a credit card and accepts credit card payments is paying for fraud through transaction fees, interest rates, and for companies accepting credit cards through lost revenue of reversed charges.

People commit suicide over investment losses all the time, even risky investment losses. I've known people who took their lives over gambling... 
Someone taking their own life is not something that is trivial for whatever reason.
@_date: 2013-01-15 14:52:52
And I read up on structuring, it's when you attempt to move large amounts over a short period, again, I don't move large amounts over a short period, I move a set amount on as needed basis. I've been audited and questioned about the transactions, and told them the same thing, I get enough money I transfer what I need to my investment account when it reaches my threshold. It's only against the law when you're trying to move VERY large sums, and trying avoid taxing authority.
@_date: 2013-10-20 19:04:28
By celebrating a baidu subsidiary that gets less than 0.1% of their traffic as a win is suggesting otherwise.

Have you seen the efforts the US Government goes to shut down online gambling? And the arcane laws they have for credit card transactions just to shut down online gambling? I know the federal government isn't he world police, but they sure as hell act like it.
I'll let you tell my poor bank account that was frozen because I participated in online poker that they can't shut it down. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:00:16
The best thing that could happen to bitcoin is a government try to ban it. Look at marijuana, and online poker.... Making something illicit makes it even more desirable

I get your skepticism, but I don't like sharing specifics until my product is at least in a prototype stage, mainly because I see so many "we're launching a new product" posts here and bitcointalk and it drives me crazy.
I'll post the faq page as soon as we get done doing some load testing, because reddit has melted down my server on occasion, and I'd hate to do that with a new product. Trust me r/bitcoin will be one of the first places I post.

So once a year when I amass enough money from bonus and budgeting, I move 9,500 to an investment account instead of 10,000 I'm committing a felony? Fuck em if I am.

None of your damn business should have been the response. But then again that's why I use a regional bank, that if I ever got that call I can walk into my local branch and ask the branch manager why the hell his bank was snooping through my personal banking information.

There are plenty of addictive activities that are bad for us. I have a real casino a mile from my home and I might go twice a year. Just because some people have problems doesn't mean everyone's fun sould be ruined. The Feds don't shut down online gambling because of anything besides an inability to get tax revenue from it.

First, don't call me condescending names. Second, they chose an arbitrary number, and publicized it. Third, criminal, and non-criminal enterprises know the magic number and intentionally split up their cash transfers via small banks in smaller amounts to not raise the ire of the IRS or the Treasury Department. I intentionally move less than 10k per transaction to my investment accounts just to keep my transactions as low key as possible.
@_date: 2013-01-14 22:55:02
They can file all the SAR they want, nothing I do is illegal. I just prefer to keep automatic filing of my private monetary transactions to a minimum.

Why would they do that? [liberty reserve site]( is still up and is a perfect example of what raises red flags for me.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:15:34
Fiat users are screwed instead by the federal reserve printing more money causing rapid inflation.

Actually you do have personal control over the access of your bitcoins, don't keep any major holdings in active (online or internet connected wallets).
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:26:30
And by e way there are legitimate companies selling legitimate goods using bitcoin processing.

Someone else's problem isn't my problem, nor should it be the rest of societies problem. If an ADULT has a gambling problem, or any other addiction it is THEIR problem, not mine. Cigarettes and alcohol do far more damage to society than even the worst gambling addictions.
@_date: 2013-10-11 03:00:37
Not surprising considering that dwolla wants to be a payment processor in fiat currency, and if they want to play with the federal reserve banking system they have to play by their rules.
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:46:15
An easy entry and exit marketplace. It's far too difficult for the general public to get their hands on bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-01-19 03:32:38
Dwolla does, due to us banking rules
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:47:05
You still have to report the USD cash value of the currency you accepted as payment for the goods or services. Adding that additional requirement of maintaining the value of the bitcoins you accepted is going to piss off your accountant or cost you extra money.
I don't accept barter, bitcoins or local alternate currency because I already pay enough to my accountant to manage USD sales...
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:18:00
You're missing my point 99% of my business is billed out via an invoice, and sent to my customer, my customers are giant corporations that pay little old me to service their equipment. They then cut me a check. How does bitcoin solve this, or bitpay or coinbase fix this?
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:17:36
So much for critical thinking and applying logic to the world around us.
@_date: 2013-01-14 21:55:31
which is dumb, criminals while the most are morons, how long does it take to figure out if I do much smaller transactions I'll stop getting audited, or investigated.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:17:18
Because using am ordinary currency costs even IRS registered non profits millions each year just to process transactions, that's the first and best reason.
