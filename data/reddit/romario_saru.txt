Of course. The problem is that NOT the people that bought earlier last year are selling, but the ones who bought in December 2017 / January 2018.
How can i tell? Because the sell-off is very aggressive. I mean, 60% retracement **without** very negative news is not normal and it would be caused only by people that recently bought in and have no idea what this market is.
They know only that they could get rich just by investing reckless.

The market is **unpredictable**, not unpredictible. Some events can be explicated and anticipated, just not all of them.
Of course Bitcoin will rise again, but this time far beyond 20k$. Why? 
1) Because there are a lot of people that did not enter the market yet. Why do i say that? Because the average people that are not security experts were afraid to invest in cryptocurrency and this year with cryptocurrencies becoming easier and easier to handle and hold they will join the movement and invest.
2) With the Lightning Network, Bitcoin will open the gates to a lot of companies to accept it, because it will be cheaper and faster, gaining new acceptance.
3) After being regulated, people will gain a lot more trust in Bitcoin and we'll see a new wave of people investing.
4) Big players will support this market ( because they make a lot of money ) and pump a lot of money in it, but you have just to be smart ant not to be trapped 
So, there are plenty of reasons for Bitcoin to grow this year.

There is no other logical reason that people with a lot of money dumping so much Bitcoin. 
Do you know that there are 1000 wallets , so maximum 1000 people (maybe less people with more wallets ),  that control 40 percent of all Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:40:17
Tommorow it will probably dip, but after this, in absence of very negative news, we may see nice uptrend
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:29:48
What do you mean?
Any source, please?
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:38:48
Do you even read the news, MikeP3939?
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:17:26
You do realize that the guy in the video is being sarcastic, right?
Because after every "crash" price go a lot higher
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:29:31
Of course it is, since the start of the CME contracts untill now Bitcoin price was heavily manipulated by the ones who shorted and want the price to remain low untill the expiration of the contracts. (26th of January)
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:35:27
Don't you see? Exactly after the CME futures, bitcoin started dipping from around 19.500$ to around 13.000$ and staying here.
There are, obviously, a lot of big traders (whales) who **shorted** bitcoin and want to keep the price low.
Read the **short theory** from the following article :
They will keep Bitcoin low until 26 january, and right after that they will buy in back at that low prices.
Correct me, if i am wrong

China didn't ban Bitcoin :)) they only banned ICO's and cryptocurrency exchanges.
But the chinesse can trade anyway cryptocurrencies through 
1. peer-to-peer trading platforms
2. even normal cryptocurrency exchanges, but they must have VPN.
So this is not a big deal..
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:56:43
Don't you see?? BLIND stupid people who are selling at these prices.
They are manipulating you to sell and to keep the price low until the CME contracts are over. (26, january)
Just look at Bitcoin price untill 17 dec. (when the contracts start) From then, it went only down. Not immediately, because it would be too obviously, but slowly decreasing. They would like to drag it even lower, but don't sell, you will regret it in february
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:51:39
Read in this article **the short theory**. Actually read the whole article
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:33:04
What the fuck is your scope here?
Don't tell me you want to help people, your are not Dalai Lama.
Oh, you are frustrated for selling at a loss? This is only your fault, don't make judgements when you know nothing about cryptocurrencies.
Do you think Japan's biggest bank would launch cryptocurrency exchange if they wouldn't have analized the market? They analized it and realised that this is the future, crypto is not going anywhere
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:33:59
Just think about this: why would Japan's biggest bank would launch cryptocurrencies exchange?
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:13:34
You are spamming and making FALSE affirmations  with NO evidence an all reddits in crypto. What is wrong with you kid?
Anyway, only because of people like you, we (the rest) are earning a lot of money
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:47:37
The wales that shorted Bitcoin in mid. December keeping the price down untill 26 January
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:27:51
Excellent job, you, who sold now and will regret in June / July
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:20:42
Yes, we can obviously see that he lost by selling the dip and now trying to spread FUD and exercise his frustrations..
So sad people nowadays..
The biggest bank in Japan wouldn't risk their name by launching something that is "ruining" or "untrustable".
My point is that they really think that the Bitcoin has a bright future.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:22:13
Here we go, today and tommorow will be probably big sell-off days (especially **tommorow** ) and after that we are on the bull run again! But be prepared for **tommorow** 26th of january
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:41:25
In my opinion, you should split your dip buying money in 3:
33% - Bitcoin
33% - Ethereum ( is backed by a lot of huge companies )
33% - Neo ( It has an enourmous number of ICO's coming and some avantages over Ethereum )
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:21:04
Yes, the ones that made shorts don't let the price to rise and the majority of kids that have no idea what is Bitcoin are selling.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:03:52
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:28:18
Yes, but they know that they can not short Bitcoin forever and they will have to let it grow naturally
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:33:32
Where is the source? Any article?
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:24:37
What's with this sudden-drop? It took us 1 day to go to 15.400 from 14.500 and we felt to 14.500 in 2 hours
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:41:46
Yes, but it is more likely to go up than to go down. Why? Because the big players are making money if the market goes up.And if the big players want the market to go up, it will go up!
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:43:55
The wales that shorted Bitcoin at CME futures on 17 dec.
They want to keep the price low until 26 jan.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:52:03
First of all, **If** it will go down to 7k$. 
Second of all, if first it goes up to 13k$ you will FOMO and buy-in back at a loss.
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:26:31
What do you think? It seems very logically that tommorow Bitcoin price will fall at least under 10k$ based on this **strange "coincidences"**. The "coincidences" are that exactly after the start of the CME contracts, price went slowly from 20k$ to 10k$ and exactly on 17th of january (when CBOE first contracts expired) price had a dip.
Most likely there will be a dip also tommorow, when first CME contracts will expire.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:17:37
You do realize that the guy in the video is being sarcastic, right?
Because after every "crash" price go a lot higher
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:13:28
No pb.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:53:48
Yes, but you need to sell so that we can buy it cheap:))
Joking, if you sell now with all that good news coming , you'll regret it in march
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:48:33
Yes, i think it won't be that big of a deal, it won't have a noticeable impact on the market
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:25:18
Taking into account that we will receive 1:1 ratio amount of B2X, i think it will have a pretty bullish impact on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:03:12
Interesting!!  So, it will fork the Bitcoin again at 28.12?
