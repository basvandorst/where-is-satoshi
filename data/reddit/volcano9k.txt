Like the mtgox CEO
Like drug dealers, murderes, pedophiles on the darknet
There used to be a legit snuff film(real people getting killed on camera) site on the darkweb that charged like 100 bitcoins to get access. Imagine how much money the site owner has today.

You are awesome, but imo you shouldnt donate to large companies, but instead donate to people who really needs.
Just my 2 cents, your 1 btc will not make a difference on the large company balance, but it could literally change a persons life
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:10:39
Thats a very stupid analogy
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:58:04

@_date: 2017-11-10 15:45:58
Dont daytrade

Bitcoin is not a currency and never will be. It is a ponzi scheme.

4k usd/month in US is not very impressive 
4k usd/month here you live like a king. Simple and easy 
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:17:01
Basically everyone in the city pays for it, not someone specifically
Its not a issue for me 
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:16:50
Its complicated
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:27:45
What wallet do you reccomend?
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:40:32
1600 USD/month is basically the dream income for the average people here, with this you can have a pretty good life with everything you need
4k USD/month you are basically rich, I dont think thats possible in the US
@_date: 2017-09-25 04:44:58


If you had, you wouldnt be working :p
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:48:31
I mean im not even seeking to break even, I Just want to convert the 10k USD I have on rest into a monthly income
If I make 0.3 btc/month im in heaven, lol
