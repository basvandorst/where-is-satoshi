Beside all the above, I wish a sort of contract for the management of a shared wallet between different people. IMHO this is a key feature for families, associations and businesses because it also prevents thefts and loss of keys. Multisig is hopelessy inadequate. Bitcoin needs more advanced options like voting and customized rights that could also expire or get exchanged, etc... I have I list of how it should work. I'm waiting for [Rootstock]( that will probably allow such features.

The fact is that there isn't one-size-fit-all-solution, Bitcoin is the standard but there is a reason for the existence of other serious Alts. For example Nxt is especially suited for that kind of use-case.

I haven't personally completed a trade on Bitsquare but I had a look around and read how it works. In Bitsquare you trade directly with other people, there's no centralized exchange with KYC/AML rules. Think of Localbitcoins but with no need to meet face to face! Disputes are resolved by arbitrators. There is a tool called [TLSnotary]( that makes cryptographic proof of https pages: for example in case of a online bank transfer you can really prove to the arbitrator that you made it or that you didn't receive it.

Congratulations, this is a very interesting application of blockchain technology. But, as already pointed out, decisions should be handed by professionals. Beside the reasons already explained it's also a matter of privacy or people would have to publicly disclose very personal informations. This could work very well, for instance, for a small municipality with a professional staff to handle it or it could help the rebirth of mutual aid societies.

Iguana is a full Bitcoin wallet in development, written from scratch and at least one order magnitude [faster and better optimized]( than any others. At the same time it also includes a full [Btcd]( wallet and [SuperNet]( features.
@_date: 2016-03-11 17:31:41

@_date: 2016-03-03 15:19:49
He's a gifted [C developer]( with also good financial experience. Previously he created the [multigateway]( that is a coin exchange that works on Nxt. For a long time he's been lead dev of [Btcd]( and has been working on the [Supernet project]( that is a complex set of tools for intercoins operations that will also help Btc. Iguana is an important step to finally release all of the above. You can read his posts in [Btt]( to get an idea of his way of thinking and working, really cool guy imho.

yes, either as chrome app or native, 30 minutes has been achieved but of course download time depends your connection speed!

thanks a lot! 
@_date: 2016-03-15 16:49:51
TL;DR: Iguana is a new Btc wallet written from scratch for [extreme optimization]( Depending on your connection speed it's blazing fast to setup a full new node. It also includes a [Btcd]( wallet with some very advanced [privacy tech]( a [decentralized pegging system]( a decentralized [exchange]( with atomic swap, a [bitcoin mixer]( decentralized [poker game ]( and, in time, many other [SuperNet]( features are going be added.
@_date: 2016-03-15 18:04:05
It's in development, no one has claimed that it's been released yet! If you're interested most dev talk takes place in the [Supernet slack]( channel  some updates are also posted in [bitco.in forum](
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:56:40
Yes he's still anonymous. He made some contributions to Nxt and also the earlier Supernet code used Nxt for some operations but now they have parted ways due to a series of irreconcilable issues

Too many bullish articles do worry me, if the trend continue I could sell and buy back after the crash when there will be plenty of articles saying that Bitcoin is dead

James is creating some impressive tech that makes running a full Btc node a lot less painful. For those who want to follow it closely, most development discussion is taking place in the [Supernet Slack]( channel 
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:01:43
For the sake of comparison could you also try [Iguana]( on the same system? It's an optimized Bitcoind implementation in C, written from scratch by [jl777]( On an high end machine it took [1 hours to synch]( but that was 6 months ago. Just install Iguana and add Bitcoin full mode. (Note: use Linux version, full mode on windows has issues to be fixed in next release)
@_date: 2016-03-18 12:16:54
The fallacy of bitcoin maximalism is the delusion that any special feature can be easily copied into Bitcoin or a sidechain. There are otherwise intelligent people that really believe such BS. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 07:54:21
The problems above are serious but they're far from being unsolvable. We're almost there:
1) A decentralized entry point for fiat money is provided by [Bitsquare]( You can't trade very large amounts but it works. 
2) The [DEX of Supernet]( uses direct atomic exchanges between all supported coins, it has decentralized fiat-money pegs if you need a proxy for fiat and anyone can be a LP = "liquidity provider" by connecting to exchanges with their personal APIs (you take the risk but can charge a premium for this).
The best of the world would be a combination of both. Since Supernet will support DAPPs it is possible in future to have Bitsquare integrated...
@_date: 2016-01-03 07:48:57
If you use Electrum you should have saved your 12 words seed, did you? With that you can recreate the wallet anywhere
@_date: 2017-01-20 13:23:13
Interesting and I wish them good luck but [SuperNet]( is near release and it already does all that, including cross-chain trading and liquidity providers but with many additional features. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:31:01
Really so and I'm amused by my perfect timing: I bought 1 Btc like 30 minutes before the dump (my previous buy had been in early november). 
@_date: 2016-11-13 16:26:01
The pegging system is completely different from Bitshare or Nubits, but of course it will have to prove itself in the field. Also it's fully integrated in the Iguana Bitcoin Wallet along with the decentralized exchange.

On chain
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:15:07
Your argument seems reasonable but you must realize that most big blockers are not contrary to 2nd layers per se, they mainly want to keep the momentum of Bitcoin adoption until such 2nd layers are actually deployed and demonstrate to work. Also such 2nd layer must compete vs 1st layer and be at least as good, not ugly hacks forced-feed upon users. No one is expecting 1GB blocks anytime soon, but a modest increase in order for Bitcoin not to lose use cases and adoption.
Many big blockers have been attacked for raising arguments against LN as a scaling solution and at last [a paper acnowledges they were right and proposes another intermediate layer to fix the LN issues]( This is at least another 18 months away beside the first 18 months for LN. What is going to happen to a Bitcoin almost unusable untill that solution works (if ever) ?
There is a lot middle ground between the extremes of "every user must run a full node" and "only miners count". Bitcoin can scale well onchain if only miners, businesses and committed amateurs run full nodes. Most users can use spv. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:58:59
A centralized exchange is a single point of failure/scam, while 3 Mgw servers run by different entities are multiple points of failure that would require a whole new level of collusion or blunder for something going the gox way. See also the [mgw faq](
Moreover this is just the starting point, atomic cross trading is in the works and superNet will be constantly improved
 
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:35:06
Yeah, very interesting service but I wouldn't use it unless in desperate hurry. I hope it could become cheaper with wider adoption.

The [SuperNet]( project is quite complex to understand but it seems pretty close to the first release of InstantDEX, that is its core component.
[This article]( and [this one]( provide a decent overview.  
I think the gateway for fiat money is provided by Coinomat and maybe other companies. Once you're in it's all decentralized. You can trade cryptocurrencies and assets. Say goodbye to being goxed and probably to traditional exchanges.
[Unique privacy tech]( provided by Bitcoindark. 
Once InstantDEX is ready there are dozens other services that will follow in SuperNet like trading bots, marketplace, poker, decentralized pegged currencies, etc... I almost lost count... 
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:05:42
This is a lot more than a simple exchange, it's the core component of the [superNet project]( the first foundation of superNet and everything else that will be build over it
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:36:35
Yes Nxt and Bitcoindark are the main core components, for infrastructure and privacy respectively, plus some other coins for specific features. But all this works under the hood. From the end-user point of view you can use Bitcoin or any other coin that has a wallet with the SN api.
Both a Qt and Electrum bitcoin wallets with SN inside are in the works. There is also a standard SN wallet, that is multicurrency and without blockchain download. 
Using a Bitcoin client with SN inside gives you access to a full trading engine within the client: coins, assets and all the main exchanges (using your private api keys), personalized trading bots, etc... then you have access to [bitcoindark privacy features]( a [decentralized market place]( and a lot of other services, both decentralized or company-based 
@_date: 2015-08-29 07:22:15
Once [SuperNet]( is ready there will be Btc wallets with [SN inside]( and anyone will be able to use [Bitcoindark]( to anonymize his Btc.

It was plainly evident that such limit was completely pointless to prevent small tax evasion and it was actually hurting commerce. So for once in a while they made the right thing and raised the limit. The sad thing is that sheeples are so mentally retarded that there were protests against it, a lot of idiots do like government,  taxes and would happily imprison, torture and kill so that everyone is a slave like them.

[BarterDex]( is near launch for average user, decentralized atomic swap exchange between Bitcoin and dozen of other coins. Later it will include include [decentralized zsnark-based mixing]( for all supported coins. Good luck China tracking it!
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:15:34
Why the article doesn't say anything about [BarterDex]( It is the most advanced Atomic Swap exchange and stand alone app release is near. The Barterdex team have been doing [hundred of atomic swaps for a long time]( and the exchange has orderbooks, zsnark based privacy and now they're [testing lite mode based on electrum](
@_date: 2016-09-13 18:02:32
Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin are all supported by the first version of [Iguana wallet]( It should be available by mid october.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:48:15
I can't find their github, is there any link? Also it's so decentralized you have to signup to use, wtf? For now they made some claims without backing up with proofs. 
The only proven working Atomic Swaps exchange that is really about to be released is [BarterDex](
It has the following features:
* No registration, just install and trade
* Realtime orderbooks
* Update your prices in realtime
* Liquidity multiplier: you can place multiple orders with the same funds, when any gets filled the others get cancelled
* Liquidity providers: any advanced user can provide liquidity by interfacing with centralized exchange with their api
* Electrum lite mode: no need to download the full blockchains of the coins you trade
* Variable confirmations preference setting: from zeroconf (25-30 seconds per trade but less secure) up to full notarization on Bitcoin blockchain
* Portfolio api: set percentage of coins you want and it automatically trades towards that goal
* No need to hold Komodo, just need the coins you want to trade
* Easy to use GUI (almost ready)
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:41:24
[BarterDex]( is far more advanced and has full orderbooks.  release with pretty gui is near

Congratulations: you just won the "most idiot comment pulled out of my ass in this thread" award. 
Nxt was created and distributed to the initial stakeholders, what's the problem with that? After one year and half the distribution is still way better than most other altcoins. Currently it is the most advanced blockchain technology with many 3rd party services being created over it. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:43:27
for normal users it's better to use Electrum, it doesn't download the blockchain but connects to nodes.

Certainly a strong crackdown on crypto would stifle development for a generation and relegate it to black markets. It depends also on how many other countries follow suit and how many stay a safe heaven. In the end howewer the government is going to lose the war, in the worst case it would take a generation or two that grow familiar with it like it happened with file sharing.

[Iguana]( should be released by the end of the year and it will support Btc, Dge, Ltc and most bitcoind compatibles. The plan is to add other non-bitcoin compatible coins as well but that will require at least another year or more.

Actually the current version is barely usable with very little features, but the next one should be a great update with escrow, arbitration, price pegging, etc... and it will also be integrated into the superNET project so you'll have 100% anonimity and can use Bitcoin or any other coin. Unlike OpenBazaar it is all stored into the blockchain, so your IP is protected and you don't need to stay online. IMHO it will the best decentralized market around

The new version of [Freemarket]( sould be out soon. Like OpenBazaar it cannot be shutdown but it is also blockchain based so they can't track your IP and, as a seller, you don't need to stay online. The first version was lacking features but it seems the new one will include arbitration, escrow and USD pegged prices. Freemarket is also to be included in the superNET project so 100% mixing and anonymity!
