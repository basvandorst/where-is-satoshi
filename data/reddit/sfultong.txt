I'd rather use altcoins that start with a snapshot of bitcoin's ledger.
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:49:44
I'm still not sure what the problem is. Just call one network "bitcoin a" and the other "bitcoin b", imagine one or both are altcoins, and now you own two separate currencies, each spendable with two separate clients. The software might need a bit of tweaking so that each client stores data in a separate data directory, but that's it.

Well, eventually a schism in the community will cause a hard fork where both forks survive, because each fork will have its supporters.
And this will be a good thing, because it will show everyone that we don't have to rely on one group of people to drive development forwards.

What's wrong with a hard fork where the community splits into two different opinions on consensus?
The fact that bitcoin can do this is what I'd say is a strength of bitcoin.

It would help bitcoin owners utilize the (possibly) superior technological characteristics of litecoin, without any further investment necessary from them.
It's certainly a quick solution to the blocksize problem, by way of increased TPS.
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:53:26
Also, in my opinion, every altcoin created with a new blank ledger harms general cryptocurrency consensus, because it creates competing investment communities.

The time to find a block solution isn't an issue, but the time it takes for a block to propagate throughout the network does. It's this latter factor that makes larger blocks liable to be orphaned.

Miners will mine on all forks that are profitable. If one fork seems more profitable, it'll draw more miners which will push up the hash rate, which will eventually make it less profitable. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:26:36
Contentious hard forks aren't dangerous either. As soon as a contentious hard fork happens, everyone who owned bitcoin now own an additional cryptocurrency, and thus their original investment has an additional possible path to future success.
The possibility for contentious hard forks is the only reason I still own bitcoin and haven't sold it all to go invest in other altcoins.

I'm not sure what logic you're working off of.

I am a huge fan of Ethereum's tech and vision.

Politically, bitcoin has already ripped in half. Software has already been developed with alternative consensus rules as well. The only thing that hasn't yet happened yet is a contentious hard fork.

Here's a question for you, not totally related to this debate, but somewhat relevant: are bitcoins simply numbers assigned to hashed public keys?
If I fork an altcoin's code, and create a new blockchain that starts off with a snapshot of bitcoin's ledger, can I call that bitcoin? It seems like i could call it bitcoin with an alternative settlement layer.
@_date: 2016-03-01 02:56:44
Here's a thought: centralization is a spectrum, and I'd rather use something that's a little more centralized if it supports many more transactions
@_date: 2016-03-24 17:43:41
Bitcoin needs to be continuously redefined to be able to compete with altcoins. This redefinition is necessarily the emergent, democratic sum of subjective views of those who use the bitcoin network.
If bitcoin is not currently what the users want it to be, either they will stop using it or forcibly redefine it.
@_date: 2016-03-04 02:11:33
Well, first of all, decentralization is a spectrum.
The internet is largely centralized around a few backbones and ISPs, yet Tor still works on it, as an example of a decentralized system built on a centralized one.
The key here though is scalability. In any sane engineering project, the lower tiers are the most scalable, and each successive level of complexity and power is less so.
The Lightning Network + Bitcoin seems like building a pyramid upside-down. It may be possible, but it offends my engineering sensibilities on a fundamental level.

A peg would be great, but beyond me technically at this point. I'm working on a bitcoin spinoff toolkit for making altcoins that start with a snapshot of the bitcoin ledger at the moment. Hopefully I'll have a proof of concept of that done in a month or so.
@_date: 2016-03-12 16:48:24
could you explain your response on twitter? I don't remember the context of that simpsons clip.
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:15:29
Right, but until the Lightning Network is built, we should let merchants know that bitcoin is inappropriate for their use, because it won't scale.
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:15:53


I don't think that's actually true. You can run mixing/laundering services on top of any money platform.
In fact, I think it makes more sense and would be easier to build a somewhat centralized but very scalable cryptocurrency, and then add anonymity on top of that, rather than the bitcoin approach.
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:12:51
Because I want cryptocurrency to succeed.
You know all those coin sales that happen when people start a new altcoin? Well, each time one of those happens, an investment community is created that is hostile to the success of bitcoin.
I want everyone in the cryptocurrency community to be working together as much as possible, not wishing for other people's projects to fail because they threaten our existing investments.
If you hold to the principle that each new cryptocurrency that is created must start from a snapshot of the largest cryptocurrency (by market cap) at the time, that creates an environment where users are always grandfathered into the latest/greatest technology.
What if we come to a point far in the future where bitcoin is fundamentally obsolete and we need to upgrade to a new technology? Do you expect everyone to sell their bitcoin and buy tokens in the new technology? That would be a huge, panicky mess.
If you use this snapshot principle, the risk of altcoin scams goes way down, because no one would buy into a fresh ledger, but they wouldn't be left behind if the new technology caught on.
If I did not believe that the ledger would survive to live on in new technologies, I would think cryptocurrency in general is much less valuable.
I'm working on developing a toolkit to make creating snapshots and embedding them in new cryptocurrency technologies easy. Hopefully I'll have that and an altcoin proof of concept done in about a month or so.

As long as whatever replaces bitcoin starts with a snapshot of the bitcoin ledger, that's fine with me.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:22:46
I'm not saying that there won't be negative consequences of it, but "someone possibly getting double-spent" is somewhat less than the end of bitcoin.
I want a contentious hard fork to happen specifically to illustrate that it isn't a bad thing. Once it happens and everyone sees that it isn't the end of the world, we can move forward knowing we have another tool to resolve disagreement within the community: because sometimes the best thing to do in an argument is to walk away, and that's what a hard fork offers us.
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:03:34

What does this mean, though? If the network can be split any time there is contention, that doesn't seem to be a very valuable asset.

Now, I'm making assumptions here, but I think there's definitely some people who believe that bitcoin needs to be protected from the technically naive tyranny of market force brigading. 
There are plenty of people here who say bitcoin is not (and should not be) a democracy, and a market is not too dissimilar to a democracy, except it's more like $1, one vote rather than 1 person, 1 vote.
Just look at the first comment on this post.

A lot of people use the majority expert opinion for their guide in fields they are unfamiliar with.

Yeah, miners have significantly more power than regular nodes. Regular nodes can only choose not to pass on blocks/transactions they think aren't valid.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:01:23
I still don't understand this "contentious hardfork will be the end of bitcoin" narrative. Will investor confidence be shaken? Sure. Will everyone sell all of their coins? I see no reason for that.
The fact is, investor confidence has already been seriously shaken, and a contentious hard fork is a definite solution.
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:39:11
BTU should be trading at least as high as BCU. Maybe the discount is because people don't trust hitbtc.
I would love to trade the BTU/BTC pair more, but there's very little liquidity. So if there are any core supporters looking to increase their holdings, please sign up on hitbtc, and I'll take the opposite side of your trade!

I believe the transaction size will be limited to 1MB to address the quadratic hashing issue, as well as obviously allowing it to be compatible with larger block sizes, if the user wishes it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:38:52
Good man
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:26:16
Let's play this out, shall we?
Miners are along for the ride, because the economic majority determines the fate of bitcoin.
But the economic majority follow whatever has the highest value proposition, and a cornerstone of bitcoin's value is its security from attack based on the high amount of hashing power focused on it.
Those who abandon the mining majority may find they're not in the economic majority any longer, either.
@_date: 2016-03-07 18:25:39


Sorry, what is?
I was just saying that during the spam attack, we entered the fee market state.
For most people making payments during the fee market state, it probably wasn't a big deal.
The issues inherent to the fee market will show up on the merchant/payment processor side.

That's how a lot of technologies die: they can't scale, but their competitors can.
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:38:06
I think every time the maximum block size is raised, it should be considered a protocol change.
From this point of view, EC is not a protocol change, it's a meta-protocol for miners to coordinate changes to the protocol.
As a meta-protocol, it doesn't require any new software, and in fact EC is already running. EC is what sets the block size limit to 1MB right now.
@_date: 2016-01-26 20:31:32
Ah, I guess that's not as bad as I thought it would be. The user will still have to manage limits for the maximum fee they're willing to spend both in an absolute sense and as a percentage of the transaction, though, and that will probably vary per transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:38:56
So what reason is there to use bitcoin with a changed PoW over other altcoins? It would no longer have a claim to good security.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:16:14


You just described emergent consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:11:22
A founding assumption of bitcoin is the rational self interest of participants, especially miners.
It seems many people here believe either miners cannot be trusted to act in their own self interest, or that having them do so will be bad for bitcoin.
If they believe either of those things, they should realize that they necessarily believe bitcoin is fatally flawed.
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:16:43
I haven't thought about it too much, but I bet you could do better than O(N^2). You really don't have to send every message you receive to all of your peers. You could probably send each peer a digest of messsages, and they could reply with which they didn't have.
I'm betting that scaling is more likely O(nlogn) bound, at most.

Some things should be used for payment, other things should be used for investment.
I think the use of "currency" in the post focuses on the former.

You're right, FT needs to be better tested. The design seems much cleaner, and seems to have more benefits, though.
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:35:41
I'm not sure how hitbtc will be doing it, but their market seems to make the most sense. If, once you enter the BTU/BTC trading pair, you can't exit until either a hard-fork or a specific expiration date, then if the expiration date is hit with no fork, you simply refund everyone their original deposits and pretend the trading never happened.
Of course, it could also just be setting up for an exit scam.
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:11:06
Because BTU is worthless if core software ends up following the same chain.
The real issue is whether the economic majority wants a hard fork to a higher block size limit, not which software users like to use.
If the tokens represented chains having different block size limits, then that would be a more meaningful bet.

This won't happen. No way would a miner waste $100M just to attack a smaller chain.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:51:57


This is true. If a majority of the miners "switch over" to EC, it doesn't trigger a hard fork.
Any hard fork only occurs when moving past the 1MB limit, and in fact you could consider any block size limit change a hard fork under EC.
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:33:34
The bitfinex synthetics are terrible, because no competent BU supporter would buy BTU.

@_date: 2017-03-22 14:02:26
I really don't think it's necessary.
This view that "there can only be one bitcoin" is making this fight a lot worse.
If we could split up peacefully and leave each other alone, it seems like everyone would be happier.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:23:48


Why? The majority will either support the changes or they won't.
If they don't, and bitcoin splits, then fine. Everyone should be able to use a cryptocurrency they support, rather than being forced to use what the majority wants.

Heh, I did notice he didn't mention Mike Hearn is employed by his company in the video.
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:13:12
What a lot of people don't seem to understand, is that emergent consensus isn't really a protocol change.
It's actually a meta-protocol for miners to coordinate protocol changes, and it's already running. Emergent consensus is what keeps the limit at 1MB, currently.
@_date: 2016-01-07 22:14:32
It seems you've established a narrative here that consensus is a fragile thing and must protected at all costs.
An unfortunate side effect of that seems to be that many people here believe that dissent is dangerous and should not be tolerated.
Maybe you feel that side effect is worth the cost, but I've always believed in the future of bitcoin because I thought that bitcoin didn't have to have one particular narrative, and could evolve to fill different niches.
I think consensus is valuable enough in its own right that it doesn't need to be protected. If there is a serious schism in the community, I'll feel like my invested wealth is more protected if there's a hard fork and the networks and technologies split in two. We're still figuring things out here, and I think we should encourage technological experimentation.
@_date: 2016-01-08 20:37:34
This is exactly why I say that all altcoins should start with a snapshot of the bitcoin ledger, so that cryptocurrency isn't seen as a trivial thing where anyone can start their own ledger from scratch.

If miner B relies on miner A to say that miner A has validated the block before mining on it, then miner A can send out invalid blocks that they have marked valid simply to get miner B to waste work on an invalid chain.
If miner B doesn't rely on miner A's flag that miner A has validated the block, what's the use of the flag?

Ideally the bitcoin reference client would stay out of political matters and make their code modular so that the non-contentious parts could be shared better.

Isn't this is an argument for altcoins? If bitcoin evolves to be less decentralized, won't you be forced to use another cryptocurrency?
I don't think you can be a bitcoin maximalist and not be a collectivist, because the bitcoin brand will inevitably be determined by the community. If the community is overrun by outside influences, you won't be able to claim bitcoin represents your values anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:57:28
Yes, but you need price to be high in the short term to attract miners.

Nakamoto consensus emerges through mining.
If you want to switch to a different consensus system for bitcoin, feel free to create a fork.
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:36:48
If you think of bitcoin as a democratic system, then miners are the legislature, and regular nodes are the judiciary.
Using that analogy, protocol changes do come from the miners.

Actually it's trading above now. It's at 0.201 compared to 0.185 BCU
There don't seem to be any terms&amp;conditions that I can find, so larger traders probably stay away.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:28:15
And miners look at all the nodes, and pick consensus rules that don't drop a significant number of nodes from the network.
Bitcoin can't be many different consensus rules at once, so it has to be a conservative compromise of consensus rules, which emerges naturally through different clients and different settings making up the network.
What many people don't seem to understand is that emergent consensus is already running on the network. Miners are correctly choosing to keep the 1mb limit, because the network isn't ready for a higher limit.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:54:07
You realize you could have avoided this confusion by using public key cryptography, right?

A decentralized, non-hierarchical development process is not something you want.
The best software projects have benevolent dictators like Linus Torvalds or Guido van Rossum. You don't want software designed by committee.
It's not clear to me how the hierarchy of bitcoin core development process is structured, but it's clear there's some structure simply because politics are being prevented from bogging down the development process.

Why are you getting mad at Erik? He has no control over the hard fork, and his policy is perfectly pragmatic.
Since Bitcoin has no specific leaders, ultimately the market decides what it will be, and the market may completely redefine it.
New investors could buy either BTC or BTU and end up losing big because it turns out not to be what the market claims as bitcoin in the end.
Consensus is impossible, division is inevitable, confusion will reign.

Look, if you can't even agree with me what the argument is about, or what bitcoin is, how is it even possible to make any technical arguments?
To me, bitcoin is a carefully balanced set of tradeoffs in terms of decentralization, privacy, speed and scalability. These tradeoffs are evolving over time, and that is what people are arguing over: the future of these tradeoffs. It's impossible for bitcoin to be all things to all people.
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:30:24
A more charitable interpretation is that we need people in bitcoin with a diversity of skills, not just technical skills.

In our recent and brief introduction to the fee market, transaction fees varied by an order of magnitude or two within a couple of days.
Whether using bitcoin is appropriate to pay for a cup of coffee vs a car largely depends on the size of fees in the fee market. At different points, different sorts of goods will be priced out of viability for using bitcoin.
Without a stable fee market, it can be very difficult for merchants or payment processors to know if it's worth accepting bitcoin.
It gets worse: if someone has been a very large amount of items for a very small price, if a permanent fee market arises that essentially turns all those transactions to dust, they lose everything. People have been saying bitcoin is inappropriate for microtransactions for a while, but how do we know what a microtransaction is, without a stable fee market?
Payment networks also rely on predictable settlement times, and that goes out the window when the fee market arises.
If I were an online payments processor, I would only consider accepting bitcoin if I could be guaranteed that fee amounts and settlement times would remain fairly predictable. This is why Brian Armstrong is extremely concerned with raising the block size limit.

I'm surprised he didn't call out

I think in this instance social consensus is more important than protocol consensus. The protocol will continue to evolve, bounded by what's accepted by the community.
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:56:32
EC is a meta-protocol, so the "mechanisms" are all manual. Miners look at the EB/AD values of previous blocks and make their own judgements on what size blocks they should create.

The bitcoin protocol should remain decentralized. Bitcoin clients should each be driven by dictators, though.

What is this special setting? What node source code should I be looking at?
@_date: 2016-01-08 14:04:32
To me, bitcoin needs to be separated into two different things: the technology and the ledger.
As far as the ledger goes, I agree with you. I'm very frustrated when altcoin developers start their own ledgers from scratch. It's an easy way for altcoin developers to make money because they can sell premined coins, but it creates needless competition in the cryptocurrency space.
As far as technology is concerned, bitcoin cannot and will not be everything that everyone wants cryptocurrency to be. As a developer working on a bitcoin-related project, I can also tell you the core code isn't too great (it's not the worst, but it's clear that it's evolved through many design choices).
My ideal scenario is for the bitcoin ledger to be the seed of all new cryptocurrencies developed in the future, and for bitcoin code and technology to be abandoned in favor of something better. I would say that most altcoins developed from scratch have all-around better technology and code than bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:29:45

But that's almost as meaningless as what you posted.
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:54:15
I don't understand why no one has pointed out the obvious flaw with this proposed scenario yet.
BTC would not be cheap or easy to mine for a long time, unless BTC had a hard fork to adjust the difficulty.
What is interesting about the falling hash rate in the fork that miners don't like, is that it'll take a lot longer and cost higher fees to send coins to an exchange, assuming both forks are traded on exchanges.
So the minority fork will take longer to fall in price, because less people will be able to sell their coins.
Maybe the dynamics of trading both sides will make it so the market self-balances the value approximately equally between both forks, because the losing side will tend to be worth more, at least until both sides have sold off the coins in the forks they dislike.
However it plays out, it'll probably take a while for the market to stabilize. Once it does, I expect the miners basically abandoning one of the forks.
@_date: 2016-01-13 06:18:43

EC is already running, and it's working perfectly. EC is mining 1MB blocks, because that's what the network will support right now.

@_date: 2017-03-25 05:25:05
You can choose not to accept the protocol that miners decide, but without miners, you don't have Bitcoin. It's always been a hostage situation; only now are people realizing it.
Why does Nakamoto Consensus presume a fixed rule set? That's clearly not absolutely the case, because if it were, it would be impossible to make protocol changes.
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:25:47
SegWit isn't that bad, but FlexibleTransactions seems better.
@_date: 2016-03-17 15:47:08
Ok, let me see if I can break this down to better understand it.
1 block confirmation: the proposal does not address this case, because the miner can simply lie to the lite client, if motivated to do so.
2 block confirmation, where malicious miner has mined both blocks: again, the miner can lie to the client
2 block confirmation, where malicious miner M mines block 1, and benevolent miner B mines block 2: in this case, miner B would set the flag indicating they had not validated block 1, thus aiding the lite client.
Did I get that right? Does that cover all relevant scenarios?
@_date: 2016-06-13 19:40:56
If Core finds BU's code useful at all, Core can merge it in at any time.

That's the way of this world though, isn't it? Eventually Big Money controls everything.


Bitcoin is a decentralized system. Everyone can choose to participate however they wish, and natural incentives keep the system running.
When you talk about employment and contracts, you're imposing an implicit hierarchy on bitcoin that I don't believe is really there. You seem to view the miners as subservient to "regular" users.
If the bitcoin protocol should grow and change, I think certain parts of it should be considered more fundamental than others. To me, the fundamental idea of bitcoin is using Nakamoto Consensus to resolve contention in a decentralized environment.
What is more natural than using the properties of bitcoin itself to evolve the bitcoin protocol?
If there is any hierarchy to bitcoin, it's a hierarchy imposed by Nakamoto Consensus.

I think an even more powerful idea than UASF is exchange-activated soft fork. If you get all exchanges to buy into a protocol change, opposition miners are pretty much screwed, right? Ultimately exchange prices are how miners make their money.
This is a very powerful idea, and it could be extended to other protocol changes. Say, if governments were concerned that bitcoin was used for illegal purposes, they could simply create a soft fork to the protocol that blacklisted certain coins. Then they could just pressure exchanges to deploy this change, and miners would be forced to adopt it, too.

What, in your opinion, should bitcoin in its current form be used for?
There seems to be a certain narrative on this subreddit that bitcoin is "digital gold" and that on-chain payments are inappropriate because payments should happen in second layer solutions.
If that view of bitcoin is correct, then yes, importing the ledger into a new blockchain if the old one breaks is a valid way of unbreaking its digital gold feature.
Let's be honest: 99% of the people here just want to get rich some day because of their bitcoin investment. As long they retain their share of a ledger, the particular software or blockchain associated with that ledger doesn't really matter.
Bitcoin core is prototype software, and the bitcoin blockchain is a prototype blockchain. Both should be discarded.

I'm surprised to hear you say that. Whenever I read "economic majority" in this sub, that's what I thought was implied: governance by market.


It's not a matter of "should". They build the blockchain, so they get to decide how it's built. The only tool we have to hold miners accountable is the market in which they sell bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-04-04 16:34:13


This is key. Miners absolutely need to be considered the keepers of the bitcoin protocol, and I'm frightened by the idea that's popular around here that users, not miners, are the keepers of the protocol.
Let me give you my vision for how I think protocol changes should work:
  1. Protocol changes should always be developed as hard forks
  2. Once a protocol change is proposed, exchanges should list futures markets for the protocol update chain vs the un-updated chain.
  3. Miners start signalling for the protocol change, if it looks like it will make them more money.
  4. If miners want, they start generating blocks with the protocol change before the futures market expires.
  5. The futures market expires and people are free to settle their exchange tokens on the appropriate chain.
This setup allows both the economic majority and miners to have a say in protocol changes.
What are your thoughts about SegWit vs Flexible Transactions?
@_date: 2016-02-23 12:50:22
I'm assuming you're referring to 
It looks like it's a little more than 3-1 in favor of core. If that's truly representative of all holders, that's pretty damaging if a compromise that's mostly satisfying to both sides cannot be worked out. If a quarter of all holders sold their coins right now, it would crash bitcoin's price to double digits, if not single digits.
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:08:01
I'm frightened of that as well.
I think ultimately all PoW is doomed to be driven by economies of scale which tend to favor large players at the expense of small ones.
I also think it'll be tough to switch the blockchain to a different PoW and still call it bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:19:11
It's 4MB blocks for 2MB of transaction space, right?

@_date: 2016-02-10 16:59:08
I think there are two factors here.
One is that a lot of people here seem to believe that consensus is a fragile thing, and must be protected by squashing dissent.
The other is that open source projects run most smoothly if a single dictator decides which code to merge. Personally, I endorse having a singular vision, as long as users feel free to fork the project and install a new dictator.
It's not very clear whose singular vision drives bitcoin right now, and that leads to some of the conspiracy talk.
@_date: 2016-02-23 12:41:47
Right, but you realize that this cuts both ways, right? There are plenty of classic supporters who will leave bitcoin if the block size isn't increased.
If a compromise can be reached that can minimize people leaving bitcoin, it should be made.
You have to be very certain that pissed off classic supporters don't hold many coins when you say compromise isn't worth it.
@_date: 2016-02-17 15:34:08
I'm not worried, because I think eventually ledger and technology will be treated separately.
So I assume my investment in the bitcoin ledger will live on in radically different altcoins, and soon enough, bitcoin itself will die, and no one will care too much.
As a developer, the idea that we take ideas from successful altcoins and then build them in on top of existing bitcoin code has always struck me as rather insane, especially when the alternative of taking the bitcoin ledger and sticking it in altcoin code exists. The latter is much easier and cleaner.
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:59:52
Down with decentralized development! (as a term that mischaracterizes how development really works)
Development is centralized, and that's the way it should be. In any smoothly running development project, there's a canonical source code repository, and a maintainer who ultimately chooses what code gets merged.
If the evolution of the bitcoin protocol should be driven by the reference client software, then ultimately maintainers of that repository are in charge of bitcoin.

Shouldn't some protocol rules be considered more important than others? If so, shouldn't NC be considered the most important rule?
If there is contention about how to change protocol rules, there should be a system for resolving it, and I can't think of a better way to resolve contention that NC, with the possible exception of coin voting.
If you consider the network to already be using NC to resolve contention for changing protocol rules, then it's working satisfactorily to most people, because it's disallowing all changes that don't have majority support.

Thanks for taking the time to explain some of this stuff.
I'm a little confused why a bunch of hard forks are being discussed now, after SegWit was explicitly developed not to be a hard fork and marketed on this "strength".
SegWit is certainly a very clever bit of code, but as a developer with a small amount of understanding of bitcoin, SegWit makes it harder to understand the workings of the protocol. A hard fork would have been a lot cleaner and more comprehensible.
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:23:33
Perhaps I'm interpreting this wrongly, but there seems to be a circularity to the claim that the hard fork is risky.

It will, when bitcoin fails to provide the necessary bandwidth.
Actually, I doubt OB will grow large enough fast enough to make a difference.
But I assume that eventually some killer app will be developed for bitcoin, it'll see huge popularity, the network won't be able to handle it, core devs will say that bitcoin is digital gold and not appropriate for killer app, killer app will switch to altcoin, and bitcoin will turn from digital gold to digital ash. Maybe that won't happen if The Lightning Network ever gets developed and doesn't suck too bad, but at this point we really should be turning as many people away from using bitcoin as possible, lest we kill it.

I think this is one of the problems with bitcoin core. The reference client shouldn't be written in C++, because then contributors need to take into account the security pitfalls of writing in C++, as well as semantic errors. Additionally, if it was written in a more modern high level language, the source code would be readable by more programmers, and there would be a wider base of potential contributors.

It seems to me that replay issues impact each chain in proportion to the relative market caps of each chain. If I lose 1 of coin A that's worth $4000 due to a replayed transaction, I care 10 times as much as if I lose 1 of coin B that's worth $400.
It seems safe to assume that 2x will have the larger market cap, given they have much stronger miner, exchange and wallet support.
Now, there is a lot of hubris on both sides that are claiming that their Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin, and they have the majority of consensus behind them. I don't think it's a particularly big deal to change consensus rules at this point. Bitcoin is currently an experimental technology in development, and we should expect that consensus rules are fairly fluid.
I agree with you that every contentious hard fork should have replay protection. To be safe, I might as well remove the "contentious" qualifier.
Also, all forks should be hard forks; there should be no soft forks because soft forks hide contention. All protocol changes should be explicitly opt-in.

Of people who have purchased bitcoin, probably 2-5% are hard core libertarian idealist crypto geeks, and then most of the rest are get-rich-quick types.
The majority of wealth will end up controlling bitcoin, because plutocracy is the natural state of this world. It cannot remain a small time niche geek project.

I don't think technology really centralizes wealth in general. I think wealth centralization just happens in cycles, where the end of the cycle is usually violent revolution to redistribute the wealth.
Technological breakthroughs usually just replace the old rich with new rich.

Yeah, I agree that at this point compromise doesn't make a lot of sense.
Still, it seems like most of the NYA members will be sticking to the original plan. I'm very curious what GDAX will do come November. Will they list 2x as Bitcoin, and ignore Core? You would think they would have learned their lesson by now about currency splits, and how you can't just pretend that only one side is real.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:05:33
I haven't fully evaluated spoonnet, but it does seem to fit better with SegWit than 2x does.
Unfortunately, Bitcoin is not a meritocracy. Large parts of the bitcoin ecosystem have lost patience with Core, and would prefer to use software from a dev team that responds to their desires in a more timely manner.
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:08:08
Any cryptocurrency can do that.

Some merchants may be able to capitalize on business brought in by the bitcoin true believer crowd who buy things with bitcoin they wouldn't normally buy (or would normally get elsewhere).
Some merchants may also be speculators, although that is probably a very small group.
Once someone comes up with a service like paypal, but for bitcoin, where anyone can pay and it will automatically withdraw from their bank account if they don't have enough bitcoin in their service account, I think that would help things along quite a bit.
Small business owners could make online shopping much easier with bitcoin pay.

And the proper balance of these goals is a subjective judgment.
When we talk about stable prices, which prices are we really talking about? The prices of things that the lower class needs, like food and energy are off the table.

The reason people are using bitcoin is because they want to escape from a monetary system managed by other people who assure us that they know what's best for us and know exactly how to fix the world.

I'm not sure why people make such a big deal about the deflationary aspect of it.
Is it better as a speculative investment than as a currency right now? Sure. But people do cash out of their investments to buy things they want. Plus, if bitcoins gain enough popularity I'm sure someone will come up with a service like paypal that will automatically withdraw money from a bank account and convert it to bitcoins for a single transaction.

The service wouldn't be anonymous, obviously.
Imagine if paypal just added the ability to send/receive bitcoin. You'd still have to have a credit card or bank account on file.

If you're buying into a very volatile and speculative investment, you should be either buying and holding until a specific profit target is met, or you should be deciding not to buy in the first place.
The only reason to sell now is if you are sure bitcoins will never recover their value, and I don't know what would make you sure of that.

Bitcoins' value lies entirely in mass psychology, and right now that psychology is one of speculation. To the degree that people start believing in a certain level of value of bitcoins regardless of where it is currently trading, we will see stabilization of value.
@_date: 2011-07-25 23:33:33
If there is a system that can get pretty close to perfect consensus, then the central authority can serve to make the system more efficient by hard-coding in certain checkpoints. If they hardcode in checkpoints that are different than the consensus, then it's trivial for someone to create a fork that has the proper consensus checkpoint.
At least, that's how I understand the current state of bitcoin.

There are no sound investment strategies in this world economic climate. Nothing is certain.
Anyone speculating on bitcoins and who is reasonably intelligent should realize that bitcoins will be volatile for the forseeable future, and may not see the highs they did this spring for a long time.
If you're investing in a "safe" investment class and it loses 3/4 of its value in a day, that's a good reason to panic. But if bitcoins lose 3/4 of their value in a day, I'll just shrug and say, "well, that's bitcoins for you". And I've put in a good chunk of my wealth into them, and am currently unemployed.

I think that's not a bad prediction. Even if bitcoin is in a bubble, it should respond to other market activity. Maybe it will be lost in the volatility, but we haven't actually seen much volatility recently.
The fact that it people do not seem to be pricing other market factors into the value of bitcoins makes me worried about exactly how much of their current value is based on delusions.
I would not be surprised if some people are buying up bitcoins at certain price levels just to maintain the image of bitcoins as stable so that they represent a better long term investment.

One might say that exchanges deserve a large stake in any new cryptocurrency, because they serve such an important role.
There are as many definitions of fairness as there are people. It's tempting to call any cryptocurrency distribution that I don't have a stake in as "unfair". If equality of stake is your thing, stellar is probably the most "fair".

That's what they thought about ETC as well. And they're probably right in the long term, but if it's possible to make some money off it in the short term, it would make sense to do that, right?
Even if only 1/50 of Bitcoin users end up using Bitcoin Cash, GDAX could make some serious money trading it.

This is a confusing post, and evokes many questions from me.

Why are you asking for suggestions if (as it appears) you have a clear idea of what makes bitcoin "boring" and therefore should have a clear idea of what you would do differently?
I'm all for more experiments with cryptocurrencies, but I would think that a good cryptocurrency would have to come from someone with a clear and complete vision. I don't think it's likely that a grab-bag of ideas from reddit will be of much help.

It seems a little convoluted and underspecified, and I don't know why they're trading against eth, but hopefully they'll straighten things out.

They'd have to be really, really unlucky not to solve a block for several days. They have a less than 1% chance of not hitting a block in a single day.

Ah, so the theory is that users will choose to value the 148 side more because their coins on that side will be less likely to be orphaned.
So what if the miners are stubborn, and don't switch to the 148 side immediately? Won't many of the users say "oh, I guess I was wrong, it looks like it's safer on the non-148 side" and switch back? The miners may in fact be counting on this.
It still seems like fundamentally the game theory underneath is essentially a game of chicken.
So according to you 148 people, users *should* prefer the 148 if they're rational. But do they? A step towards making this situation less scary would be for exchanges to offer 148/non-148 futures, so we can clarify what the economic majority really wants.

Yeah, I would say that bitcoin's ledger is even more important than bitcoin's network or specific technology.

Immutability is the most sacred tenet of bitcoin. We must be ready to change anything to save it.

I don't think it's even a matter of a secret agreement. It's simply that the USD is the reserve country of the world and pretty much everyone thinks in terms of dollars (especially because oil is/has been priced in USD), so they have to follow its lead.

huh? are you talking about space mining?
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:04:15
how do you figure?

For whatever reason, and the miners don't seem to trust SegWit.
Why not try to get them to accept bip140 instead? There's less stuff in it, so there's less stuff to object to.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:07:04
aha! So another silk road seizure, then.

So you're saying cryptocurrency will never go mainstream?
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:20:03
So it sounds like, if you want to live a middle-class lifestyle, $4M is the lower bound of fuck-you money. I suppose with health care costs included, it'd be more.

what are your methods?

What do you mean by this? Simply the volatility you mentioned?

It sounds like the wallet file is corrupted. Depending on how corrupted it is, you might be able to get someone technical that you trust to open it up in a hex editor, find your private keys, and reconstruct a validly-formatted file.

If you're generating 1/30th of the total bitcoin network's hashing power, why even join a guild?

It should be disabled by default. At least, it's disabled in my account that I created a couple weeks ago.

I think the main "craziness" is in that he thinks this is somehow possible.

I'm not convinced self-signed is somehow worse than signed by an official signing agency.

There's no reason bitcoin can't live in regulated spaces and unregulated spaces at the same time. The majority of bitcoin speculators are probably fine with regulation.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:19:55
So if someone wants to cash out a large amount of bitcoin, how do they do it without arousing suspicion? Are dark pools the only real way to go?
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:07:19
Letting the yuan float seems  sensational news to me.

I don't think you're properly evaluating the motivations of the newly rich.
If I'm not initially rich but I suddenly find myself rich due to a speculative investment, I'm going to immediately look towards diversifying my assets so that my wealth is safer. I may keep a portion of my wealth in bitcoins, but probably no more than a quarter.
I find it much more likely to think that bitcoins have created a chain of modestly rich speculators, who have sold off most of their share to create the next generation of rich.
Eventually the people who were rich becfore bitcoins even existed will buy up most of bitcoins, and the wealth distribution in bitcoins will become a reflection of the wealth distribution of the world in general.

Destiny! I have this terrible feeling, deep down in my heart, that you're not being entirely forthright here.

What do you mean catastrophic? Do you think that bitcoin will permanently go to 0 over a few taxes?
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:41:47


I think what Spittin_Venom is trying to say, is that you can take pretty much any uneducated person off the street, and they could give you a fairer, more efficient way of allocating funds than how federal taxes are spent.

That's an ironic choice of words. Sincerity is often judged by the sound of people's voices.
