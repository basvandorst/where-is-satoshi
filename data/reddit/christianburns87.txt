I did not ask them to give me any private keys, in fact i asked them to use it on their end to give me the well known USDT which is supported by BTC blockchain.
They lied and said there is no private keys which is insane, there is no such thing as a wallet without a private key, they think im a newbie

They can do it easily on their end, i offered to write a technical guide to show them how if they dont know how, and offered to pay a fee for their time, i had the same problem with binance and they helped and charged me a fee
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:35:45
I had the same issue with Binance ( Biggest exchange on earth ) and they charged me a fee and helped
i can pay the fee ofcourse, the issue is they are not willing to help at all and support team saying there is no such thing as getting them back, that is why i was surprised 
1- of their technical information level
2- and their methods
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:40:17
I will do that

@_date: 2018-09-16 15:43:36
Looks like LBC bots and accounts downvoted you!!
i PMeD you
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:38:59
Accidents like this will make people lose faith in big crypto names like LBC, they should make people feel safe, i'm happy i knew the truth in such a low amount, imagine if they received 100000 or something from someone and said bye bye its crypto, welcome to the crypto world, your money is gone
Banks are bad but LBC made banks looks like angels  
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:42:17
Number one tech magazine had a similar issue before with Binance and they helped, which means you and LBC team are scammers
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:41:09
I have everything documented and the money is not mine, i work with one of the top 10 technology magazines world wide and the money belongs to them, i will leave the legal action for now till we reach a dead end 
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:41:35

@_date: 2018-03-14 02:28:09
I mean that video, It's explaining what BTC is. millions of people still don't know more about bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, It's a new culture for many ppl. I hope you got it.

based on what?
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:56:37
African countries suffer from weak currency value next to the dollar so they turn to cryptocurrencies to maintain the value of their savings. Africa will always be at the top of the list
