Bitstamp accepts SEPA but I don't know of any limits. Withdrawls cost 0.90€ (assuming €)

I just tried it with this seed: `receive pioneer stay island original enjoy picture still seek hint cry cradle`
The website and electrum generate this as the first segwit address: `34qFTWKLuwGagndZcPEWP6HqNg4K3y5fP1`
The website gives me this private key: `L3kY9rukjbKWgEoVfdyvRF5rGDMbQekJvJVhh8miQJzXeU8C4r2a`
Electrum gives me this private key: `LLuoJBdZ5u9ndGq2mnmi1bGpm5ku5VHmFBjxp3TuPGVxD8ZoMgte`
Derivation Path was `m'/49'/0'/0'/0` on the website and `m'/49'/0'/0'` in Electrum.
So I get the same behaviour, different keys for the same address, maybe the derivation path in electrum needs to be adjusted?
Regarding the legacy address question: The private key can be used to generate a legacy and segwit address, so if Omniwallet is just generating a legacy address from the key, then thats it. Is Omniwallet even supporting segwit?

When adding the extra /0 for electrum, it will generate different addresses. It seems, that it adds the /0 by itself. 
Sadly, I don't know what could be the cause of this :/

Google also disables the old NPAPI system almost every plugin uses with Chrome 42. Here is their FAQ entry: 
Other plugin developers had problems with this, too.

ME is not IMPI. AMT uses ME to provide IPMI functionality but ME also exists if AMT (and therefore IPMI) are not there. We have a bunch of laptop at my university with Skylake i7s and they all have ME while not having any IPMI functionality.
We use ME in conjunction with SGX to provide monotonic counters (like a TPM) and a trusted timesource for SGX enclaves (Well the Intel SGX SDK provides this but we use it).

For anyone currently at the 30C3, it is located at the hackcenter. If you look from cbase to the exit it is on the right where they sell arduino led kits and stuff.
