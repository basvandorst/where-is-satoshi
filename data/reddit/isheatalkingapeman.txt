I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you. I just took a little umbrage to your quip regarding "the people of Bitcoin" without, apparently, considering the scope of the statement.

I don't think you completely understand the nature of the internet, software, the human condition, or human ingenuity. Bitcoin is *not* only currency... are you kidding? You're basically saying because email requires/ed ISPs for mass adooption, it's not feasible or possible to have email. Or because browsers are needed for most people to surf the internet, we're not going to have the internet.
A world-wide public ledger able to be transmitted over radio, phone, or internet is not magic, but it is a notable and momentous invention with [nearly boundless] potential.

I appreciate what you're saying and find truth in it. Although, I don't think we're necessarily debating the same thing or have the same idea as to what Bitcoin/bitcoin is. 
You can go to a non-surveilled brick and mortar building now, pay with cash for a product, and the clerk deny service/goods. It'd be your word against his/hers - analogous to BTC transactions. I may be incorrect, but there'd be nothing you could do aside from merely call the police. Unless it's a reoccurring problem, they'd be pretty helpless. 
BTC (currency) is cash for the web. You're right in that there's drawbacks to it, as there is with fiat cash. Nevertheless, what we have here is the ability to circumvent the middle-man and send money directly to your friend/family in China. Plop that money down and there it is - it's cash in a box, cash in a screen. So, from that perspective, your above comment is wrong and it does solve the problem I'm speaking to. It's a huge problem and Bitcoin helps fix the problem. The basic nature of the system/protocol will not "allow" middle-men if you don't want them. Down the line there will likely be 'regulation,' but that doesn't meant we'll lose the most basic functionality of it - decentralized, P2P verified information/data/currency. 
Then, to top it all off, we still haven't talked about the potential of the protocol itself. Aside from the huge implications it has for personalized store coins/frequent buyer cards, there are applications for Bitcoin that we're not aware of yet. Solving the two general's problem, the double-spending problem isn't trivial business in the least. It's historic.   
My point is: the entire enterprise that is Bitcoin is extremely valuable on multiple fronts. It's a *valuable* invention for humankind for numerous reasons and through that reasoning there's [probably a lot of] monetary value.

You make some good points and have some decent replies. 
To add: using Bitcoin, the average Joe is able to help his brother John and sister Julie, redress the market, government, and financial industry for possible grievances. That ability wasn't easy for the "commoner" until now. 
"Decentralization" is an important concept and shouldn't be dismissed or discredited out of hand. The concept is totally foreign to some people and needs to be impressed upon and eagerly taught about. Bitcoin can potentially lead to counting votes without a third party. Most citizens are interested in such possibilities and will be excited to hear such a thing. 
Bitcoin may allow for fewer DMV (motor vehicle licensing, paperwork) visits. Bitcoin can help reduce bureaucracy bloat - may be able to reduce notaries, lawyers, or accountants employed by government. With that said, *yes*, much is in the future and will require a vision to determine value. 
It's an opportunity to think differently about the world and take part in removing great levels of inefficiency, dishonesty, and manipulation within the current system. Work and help is needed, undoubtedly. 
The average Joe believes the "banking system" is dishonest and usurous - rightly or wrongly. Bitcoin is a way to redress organizational grievances.

I'm not sure if I agree that bitcoin will contribute to totalitarianism, though see your point and find it alarming. Nevertheless, the chilling effect is very real and 100% terrifying. My browsing habits have changed drastically in the past 2-3 years. I no longer feel safe just going to Al Jazeera for even basic, non-political articles - lest I be thought of as a sympathizer of ... humanity ... education (?). It's dreadful surfing the internet at times. What I once found to be fun, enlightening, and interesting has turned into a mine field fraught with worry that someone will see interest in, say, Middle-Eastern history as anything more than a desire for education. It's literally terrifying. It's difficult to find the words to describe how heinous it really is. 
Sometimes I think, perhaps, I'm over-reacting, but I'm not so sure. What we stand to lose with such a society or culture is detrimental to the future of humanity. We'll waste away into nothingness and/or retard-ism at the current rate. Those who attempt to pull the strings are of no consequence, as their children and/or progeny may never know the difference.

As pointed out, there are some really amazing and evolutionary aspects that make bitcoin very important to you, your class, and school's future.

The cat's out of the bag. There's no going back. Sure, regulate Bitcoin up and down, but there's going to be a doppelganger replacing it in no time fast.

I'm your generation. You were on the "inside" of the blossoming e-mail and internet industry, which provides for expertise and a bias. I've pointedly made it a point that your viewpoint has validity. Yes, email was around largely in bigger organizations early 90s, definitely. Yet public dialogue on it wasn't fully mainstream. Anecdotally, I was one of the coolest kids when Killer Instinct came out in arcades in 1994 because I was using measly Prodigy for the codes to be that boss guy. People were paying me $20 for the codes when they could have had them "for free" through the "totally widespread internet and email."
I grew up around BBSs and I'm just saying that it seems like a bit of a contrarian stretch to say bitcoin and email protocols are "completely different" notwithstanding cultural, "wow", techno-geek fashion. Whereby, it just so happens durrbitcoin is moderately impressive mathematics in an "economically emotional" industry and society (i.e. global power, personal finance, income).  
Bitcoin is a novel protocol that allows near instantaneous "verifiable" contact and data transmission with another across the globe. And that's pretty close to e-mail if it's characterized like that.

This is a good idea. 
Also, I think that a good point to bring up is the apparent, wonton greed and corruption that often stems from centralized organizations. They're not inherently bad, but we see examples of it time and time again throughout history. A majority of people are radically affected while a small minority escape justice. Bitcoin can help stem the abuse through financial (currency) and other social means (vote-casting; protocol). 
Edit: Be sure to mention and acknowledge that there is a lot of propaganda around the issue. Do your own research. Though, it's interesting to see where the harshest criticism arises. Bitcoin isn't a panacea, necessarily, but it's a good step in the right direction.   
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:25:49
Well, I was initially speaking from a more general, philosophical point of view. As in, grass-roots organizations or community-driven projects are a creative bunch and an issue of this magnitude, albeit sizable, isn't an idea-crusher or movement stopper by any means - because human ingenuity and creativity finds a way in matters as large as these. 
But, to more directly answer your question, I think it's hard to compare to much, just from the nature of technology and the internet itself. Nevertheless, two examples of impassioned communities thriving in such environments I think may be analogous: flight and its eventual commercial adoption, or the writing of government documents/charters/code in difficult times

I think it enhances the definition by incorporating and giving distinction to realized  A) spatial coordinates on the Earth and (perhaps) beyond   and   B) reminds the reader that we do, in fact, live in ([at least]( four dimensions. 
As an aside, people seem to get glossy-eyed or quizzical when one says "in time and space", as if it's some lofty thought. I can see how or why some arrive at that point, but modern thought should/could be aware of the term and meaning of "time and space" in general, if that makes much sense.

People compare the two because it's a "protocol" on the internet. Indeed, there are numerous protocols, but not often do some come along that "solve an old math problem." It's novel. E-mail was/is novel. The internet is truly amazing, astonishing in itself and bitcoin, on top of it, assists in near instantaneous contact and/or data transmission with another person around the planet in a slightly different way than email, but still relate-able on a non-technical, anthropological level.

I appreciate your reply and see the logic. I wasn't necessarily talking about technical vs. fundamental price changes, although it is nice to read about that and have learned some things.  
In tandem, I was more speaking towards what your feeling of the value of the actual invention of the bitcoin protocol is. That is to say, the open-source, peer-to-peer, and heavily connected block-chain ledger that encompasses the Bitcoin idea and concept is truly state-of-the art solving an old problem. Do you see a value in such an invention? 
I wasn't going to mention it, but I guess it's obligatory just because it's still cropping up: nobody NEEDS gold either. That argument strengthens the need for bitcoin. Yes, gold is used industrially - though, we have comparable, replaceable materials, just as there's need for basic computer processes but can be done with different components. 
Your point of view isn't invalid, by any means. There isn't much of a sure thing in this world. And considering humanity is largely, sometimes illogical... who knows!? Bitcoin is pretty fascinating either way.   
@_date: 2014-10-15 03:00:28
This is good to have somewhere during your surely paced, decisive speech. 
Additionally, I think something easily relate-able that you may consider adding is Bitcoin's (the protocol, as opposed to *b*itcoin, the currency) ability and value as a world-wide public ledger. That is to say, it is an open, transparent Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for everyone the world over - free to use in most capacities. Not only can it be used as a currency or unit of exchange, it can also be scaled for use in government - for *local, state, and national levels* as a tool for stopping wanton waste and abuse, while promoting a truly more open and accountable record that ultimately translates into higher levels of trust, productivity, and competence. It's a win-win situation all-in-all.  
New technology can be daunting or worrisome, some may say. The wheel was and is surely something to marvel and sometimes run from, lest you get run over by such a contraption. Then imagine living when the scales were invented or prominent. Here we have a tool of the times in which we can *purposefully* and consciously use for the betterment of public and private life; suited for city living, as well as rural.

Ahh, yes. And that's entirely possible, I suppose. Though, and some would categorize this as naive or perhaps vague, but the basic technocratic environment is such that once one reaches a point in understanding the internet and what it entails, and now, what bitcoin entails, there's a strong sense to use it for common good. There are different definitions for "good" but I like to think the arc of morality bends towards justice. 
I maintain the internet, the world-wide-web, the intertubes, is comparable to the wheel in historical terms. We're still coming to grips with it, hearkening to our need for "growing up" as you mentioned above. Now, bitcoin enters the environment and shakes up an already emotional subject - money. 
To me, there's a deep sense among nearly all people that there's a different set of rules, so to speak, in higher finance which seems to result in a greater disparity in wealth had the "skimming" not taken place. It's an old issue and most people just accept it. Here's a way to, in the very least, curb wanton abuse - and that's a good thing.      
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:44:11
So, I'd say Bitcoins exist without space, but that's only looking at half of the picture. They require actual innertubes to travel down, computers/monitors to be viewed, and physical beings in physical space to use and transmit ... so, 'space' is relative? ;P  
I totally get where you're coming from though and I think it kinda goes back to what we were talking about before: adding 'space' definitely has the potential to, perhaps, cause more confusion in the short term, but is better and helps with 'education' and confusion in the long run. I'm not sure though ... it's tough, you don't want to think too much about it though, then you get lost in irrelevant details without knowing it.  
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:56:56
I think you make a good point that is a great motivating factor, even if daunting at times: the internet and bitcoin together are revolutionary inventions that don't quite have historical references and have great potential. We are now able to "do things" that we never thought possible or realistic before.

Nevertheless, your writing and vision of the situation is perfect in my eyes. I'm angry in many ways, as are many, but the guy at the center of this all is definitely feeling it in a bad way. He's probably not sure if he died and went to hell, as crazy as that may sound. There's no good to come out of it with a scornful or vengeful attitude.

Regarding the "solving an old problem" bit: 
Yes, yes, yes. I've seen the exact same thing. 
Mentioning that it **solves an old mathematical problem** hits home with a lot of people. It's intuitive. A lot of people think, perhaps, "Oh, ok... an old math problem. Gosh, math problems I know! And this solves a really OLD problem! Ok, I can see VALUE in that!"
Solving an "old math problem" isn't inherently valuable, but if you can connect the dots and use that problem and its solution to "ease friction" in a current system - well, I'd say that alone is extremely valuable.

It's similar to an abusive relationship that you just can't get out of. Consumers are nickeled-and-dimed, gouged, and skewered on a daily basis by and for the larger banking organizations - and I'm literally sick and tired because of it. I'm done with them. Kaput. There are some necessary and positive works to banking organizations, but historically their big despicable rip-off machines shine through at times to expose the fraud and deceit - such as the 2008 World Economic Collapse, where more wealth was stolen and decimated in the history of humankind.

I think maybe something that a lot of people miss within bitcoin, aside from the protocol's fundamental and basic computational breakthrough, is that some see it as the populace's creation or construction of a new payment network that, in many respects, is altogether *better* than the current. 
Additionally, widespread "nickel-and-dime" gouging of the general populace is tiresome and now remediable. It's been a problem since the dawn of currency and usury, but this just so happens to have the potential of stymieing some of the so-called abuse. An open-source populace driven system of payment, such as bitcoin, etc... attracts a lot of people who want to get out from under the boot of big finance and are willing to work, speak, educate, and "forge" a new network for the benefit of themselves and many. I don't understand why more people aren't doing the same, even in the face of "insurmountable odds."
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:26:58

It's like taking a new type of bus/automobile to the grocery store and talking to the clerk. Or using a brand new phone with novel features and talking about it. If the person you're talking to may be interested and seem receptive, some people are gregarious enough to bring it up and you know, like, um, talk about it in earnest. It's called human communication and connectivity.

It could be argued that electronic-mail wasn't widely adopted until the mid to late 1990's.

I can speak around what I think your point is and emphatically answer "yes" in terms of an individual loan, per se. One could seek out a private loan and buy a yacht or house with a contract with one of thousands of people with a lot of bitcoin, as we know. Though, if you mean a "loan" or "mortgage" from a centralized institution with a private legal team and a contractual agreement, then no, not at this current time (quite within the realm of possibility, nevertheless - banks implementing the tech is a no-brainer), but that's not BTC's (currency) role in a decentralized, trsutless data transmission. 
The internet is open 24 hours, basically. That's all this is saying - I don't necessarily disagree with some of the points being made here, both ways, but some of the posts seem to border on vitriolic. It's odd and uncharacteristic.

Yes, there're always people who are awkward (or whatever you want to call it), but the whole world and life itself is "awkward." Talk about the things you love.

This is *powerful.* Eight days from idea to implementation. Bitcoin must get into, if you will, crowd-sourced "mainstream guerrilla marketing" like this. **It's totally, 100% feasible and effective at this stage.** 
Edit: We've numerous possibilities. How about a sky-writer over a big event or gathering for ~2.5BTC? From billboards (personally, I've experience in designing, purchasing, and attaching/fixing billboards) to radio and television commercials to street corner sign-holders - there are people out there ready for Bitcoin.

Of course "open-source" everything isn't just like, the best. Nevertheless, there's a lot of good to be said for it.
People are extremely annoyed by real or perceived treatments of injustice and inequality, speaking in relation to finances, crises, bubbles, "nickle-diming the consumer", outright gouging... all these occur daily, weekly, yearly, decade-ly and there's potential to stem that abuse. The current mechanism happens to be open-source.

Right, right. I was just a little irked in my post and have noticed that every little hiccup in every step helping people adopt sometimes throws them back two steps.

I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you on some points, but if someone has an amount of a particular good or service and thinks another party may be interested in it, then talking to that party and coming to an agreement isn't necessarily cajoling. It just seems your tone or characterization of it is a bit slanted. 
I see it as helping adoption through speaking and educating others, not twisting people's arms to accept it - those people didn't have to accept it or even have the intellect to sit through understanding.

Heh. Ok, man, I get it: you have a beef with BFL. Cool. Ok, I don't blame you, necessarily. You're obviously so set in your point of view, though, that you can't possibly see how this is an *arranged and agreed* upon transaction (by... **adults**) in which took place a net positive transaction for all people involved, as well as a boon for adoption and education. This is a classic example of cognitive dissonance and, in turn, biased writing/thought patterns. 
Ooooooooh it was "scary" for them to sell their house ... is that all you're hanging onto in this debate in which you can't bring yourself to see the potential of another possible perspective? If it was soooo scary, why'd they sell their house? If it was sooo arm-twisting, why'd they - oh I don't know - call the authorities because big bad man was "cajoling" them to the point of "scariness." 
I've shown you the positive aspects to such a transaction and the undeniability that it's events such as this that underpin and drive the bitcoin community. Bitcoin just wouldn't be where it is today without people - whether it's person 1 or 2 or 2^x - doing what was done in this article, *irrespective* of who or when or why. It seems pretty apparent that you have an axe to grind with your best friend's lover, which isn't what this is about.

It's obvious to me, at least, that you have a bone to pick with BFL. I'm not impuning or attacking you, but the verbal-typed gymnastics are notable in regards to adoption and the organic process it's taking. 
You must be kidding that so-called one-off sales like this don't help bitcoin adoption. That's some real cognitive dissonance with biases, as far as I'm concerned. Aside from the very real newspaper article, the sellers of that house are - guaranteed - telling everybody something along the lines of, "Wow... can you believe we *found a buyer*, it was done with this bitcoin thing (which, like, solves an ancient mathematical problem), *and* we saved a boatlaod of money and are going to Tahititi on the extra dough!? Drinks on us!" Guests reply: "What's Bitcoin? I'd like to know more about this Tahititi thing."
I don't want to argue anymore, but the adoption process is an undertaking assisted by everybody - companies like Coinbase and bitpay (merchant adoption doesn't just come strictly from solicitations from companies - there haven't even been *any* companies to be doing the merchant-adoption-solicitation until recently; where and why have businesses been accepting bitcoin if not from friend or customer communication/arm-twists) to friends on the street passing it back and forth to one another (which I've done with friends). We wouldn't be where we are today if we took your hypothesis or analyses to/of bitcoin adoption.

True in many respects. I think part of it is that it's a matter and issue close to many people: finances/money. People are generally nervous about their finances and banks are known to be relatively safe option sometimes. But, there *are* other options, as odd or uncomfortable as it may be to talk about. 
Pulling back in scope a little most people on the planet are workers on the daily grind, so to speak, and have accepted the current regulation and taxation of their paychecks. I'll bet 1000BTC to a jelly doughnut that a hefty majority, perhaps 70% (yes, pulling that out of nowhere), of first and second-world public persons would prefer the bitcoin payment system to the current if only educated. I think that's why those that understand it, even with many of its faults, want to see it succeed - as it can curb the nickle-and-dime gouging of the general populace.

I agree with you. Also, though, I think there is a real disconnect between the older generations and modern, contemporary life that shouldn't be discounted. It needs to be admitted and some of today's issues need to be owned up to in terms of taking responsibility for the serious issues we see as a nation and planet. It's not necessarily any one person, but a group mentality that has run amok - largely in name of profit, business, growth, etc... All funneled through easily corruptible centralized organizations, which is apparently natural, in some far-out respects, but is an issue born of pre-industrial and industrial era ethos. We're in the Information Age. We can do better. For everyone.

You don't live in my town. You don't visit the places I visit. Hello, and thank you for the brochures and the time you've spent on them and distributing them, truly. They're great. You've provided inspiration for a lot of people to get involved with Bitcoin.
Edit: I was actually going to see if more were available, though I better not let you know my real name! I understand your worry of them going to waste. I've spent a lot of time and money on marketing in similar fashion and understand where you're coming from. I agree that there's potential for negative association in some situations, but you never know the *one* person that may find it interesting had you never left it somewhere (it's a bit of a chase your tail exercise at that point, but the point stands, I think). These brochures are good even in context *you* may deem bad, in my opinion. 
Either way, I mostly hand them out to interested parties directly, leave a few regularly at bitcoin accepting/dispensing venues with owners, and (admittedly, apologies!) leave a few in ATM machines, as I think it's better someone's visual and neural complex processes bitcoin for one second, rather than zero second, at that instance, ya know? 
There are a few places around this city that accept and dispense bitcoin, and as such, have people interested in Bitcoin. While speaking with owners of these various venues, they are quite appreciative of the information presented in the brochures, as are the customers.

Possibly some important points to hit on: 
1) It's a protocol like HTTP. Hey, not that big of a deal - it's just extremely novel/efficient! It's a public-based, totally transparent protocol. Currency - Bitcoin - is but one end result of this protocol. We're finding other amazing uses for the protocol beyond merely currency. Totally transparent.   
2) Analogous to Email - mail! 
3) It's democratic. It seems the people are being gouged by current leadership through the nature of campaign financing and lobbying. The financial disaster of 2008 is still being felt in many, many areas. Bitcoin gives power back to the people. 
4) There is rampant money laundering, drug dealing/buying, etc.. with "normal" currency. It's everywhere.
5)Propaganda is seen on all sides, undoubtedly, but most often the negative propaganda is arising in the direction of older generational government workers and representatives. Our nation's current leadership and policy makers are, largely, technologically incompetent.
6) The Internet is an awesome force and has the potential to increase the standard of living, education, and finances of people around the globe. Open and free internet is extremely important. Bitcoin is the longtime coming of amazing work by an amazing person that apparently was looking out for the best of people. It's the people's currency. Totally open and transparent - in some sense, backed up by the people of the world.
7) Again, it's just a protocol like HTTP! It's not wiping out regular fiat bills anymore than email wiped out regular mail. It's an open market. It's just a cheaper, more efficient way to deal with personal financial matters without the gouging and fees.

People are sick and tired of getting gouged - and nickled and dimed by the financial industry, not to speak of it obliterating the world economy numerous times over, and it's that sort of thing that sustains a movement like bitcoin and exposes those who a) don't understand key elements or b) those profiting from the current gouging and fraud.

It's hard to pinpoint where bitcoin's value may come from - you ask 10 people you'll get 10 different answers. Is it solving an old mathematical problem? Is it the cash-like ability?

You have to understand .. this latest financial crisis wasn't like any other. To put it modestly, it was like a beacon in the night - a flash from a lighthouse warning us to wake the fuck up. The world is a very small and connected place now. A relatively few amount of people can do a lot of damage to a lot of people everywhere with real consequences - this was effectively the largest loss of wealth in the history of mankind. It's not like the good ol' days - in more ways than one - and those at top will do better to understand that sooner rather than later.

Because it allows for a record keeping in funding and financing unparalleled to anything before - thereby opening the door to greatly reducing the abuse and waste we see in much of government at the local, state, and national levels.

? What the heck. This is hilarious! I don't see why it's so hard to understand. You, uh, pull the money out of an exchange OR trade with a wealthy investor/person (e.g. Vinklewoss bros or perhaps The World's Most Interesting Man [he's rich right?]) OR trade with a non-wealthy person that likes bitcoin and, er, um, like you have a million dollars.

That's a good idea. I wonder what the circumstances would be at a farmer's market if one were to arrive with only a vending machine? I'm personally an advocate of farmer's markets, I'm sure talking to people from a social awareness perspective regarding bitcoin would be a hit and could make setting up there a great opportunity. 
I was just thinking: there are numerous places in my city that a Bitcoin vending machine would be absolutely great. I wonder if there'd be a way to set up a sort-of "roaming" machine with local businesses? Find ~7 businesses/events who show interest, one for each day of the week, and move it around. Or maybe change locations every week - that may be better ... just thinking out loud

You bring up a very strong and valid point in my opinion. We need to put our h[e]( together and move forward with a substantive marketing push. I would most certainly be willing to invest/donate towards verifiable marketing or advertising.  
*Sky-writing.* Looks like the going rate is about 2.5BTC. Any of the sporting events that sell advertising space are options. Billboards are easy and relatively inexpensive.

I"d be curious to know the percentage of Goxees that still see the true innovation at hand. I'd be willing to bet that at least 1/3 of the people (if not more along the 1/2 line) are still interested in the technology and/or ultimately support the technology.
There's blowback from the current circumstances, but the point still stands. The current financial system is buzzard-like, if you will, and the Bitcoin protocol can stem abuse of such a system. And for those who see that, then talking about it and educating people about it is worthwhile for not only now, but further down the line. 
There's money to be made and lost, assuredly.

I feel for you (wo)man and can relate. You have a fair point. There have been quite a few people who've lost a lot of money around bitcoin. Though, I think it's fair to say there has been a lot of money lost investing in all things not bitcoin, as well. More to the point, though: jumping into the bitcoin market at $1000 last December or January should/could be a calculated investment with *much* research and understanding involved - knowing that in all likelihood, in 10 months time, one surely isn't going to be wealthy, or that a sizeable return is imminent. Average-wise buying and holding bitcoin during its ~five year existence shows a pretty good return. Not trying to be argumentative, though think that some of your ire is unwarranted. 1001 bits

It's so hard navigating the complexities of the human mind and future of humanity knowing that we, humanity, are often unintentionally irrational actors. But one thing that keeps true rationality afloat, I posit, is the good-will and optimism of man and woman. Such real good-will is seemingly hard to find in government, but there are some sensible officials who see the relationship between banking, wherein great dishonesty occurs, "the people," and Bitcoin, wherein less dishonesty awaits, perhaps. 
Centralized organizations are more susceptible to corruption, it surely seems. Truly understanding Bitcoin, as sounds like Yellen may, is demonstrating leadership that appears to be selfless and good-willed. 
I guess what I'm getting at is how can one read, contemplate, and understand Bitcoin and not see the great positive potential for humankind?

I appreciate where you're coming from and don't deny an analysis that e-mail was adopted quickly. Though, for you to deny that it didn't take 10+ years - say, 1986 -1996 - to be in widespread use is odd. 
Also, I think you fail to acknowledge the social and technological bounds during e-mail adoption and bitcoin adoption (e.g. population, past and current events [ie 9/11, 2008 derivatives collapes] But therein is the difference and why, from the on-set of this that I said it's **anthropologically comparable** - which I stand by.

You bring up a good point. Just by virtue of the internet alone, the younger generations are exposed to ideas and knowledge at unprecedented rates. Unfortunately the older generations are largely incapable of understanding the new scale and complexities/simplicites of the world. It's changed radically in the past 30 - 40 years. 
I think it's fair to say that the overall intelligence level and/or education level is greater in the younger generations compared to older generations at the same instance. Education or potential education (i.e. internet learning or use) is drastically greater for a random twenty year old, relative to one 50 years ago. This is somewhat of a platitude, but nevertheless more true today than ever before.
If there were a magical switch of power from those who are seated now in heads-of-state roles to those 30 or younger and capable, the world would be no worse off. In fact, my money is that the world would be much, much better off. Primarily due to the influence of the internet and its ability to educate on particular disciplines, as well as grand-scale world topics/events as never known before.

We like to think of ourselves as living with above average intelligence, which I'd agree understanding the rudiments of bitcoin and its relation to the world and history takes a bit more intelligence and/or education than the average person, though still makes one wonder.

True. Your level-headed approach is appreciated and admirable. 
The close relationships and congruent locales of the people in question is odd, to say the least, though. In some terms, that's not blindly discriminating. 
Nevertheless, giving the benefit of the doubt to Mr. Pierce is what we can do and, perhaps, should, though surely he sees the ridiculous nature of the entire bitcoin world/climate/universe and its relationship with modern society and media and think, "Well, maybe right now isn't the best time. If I'm really out for the best of everybody, which I am, 'now' is not the time to embroil myself further, as we all sometimes do and look back upon in stupidity." 
The perception and associated coverage of it is cancerous. It's not something that is healthy for growth in personal, societal, or adoption terms.

Furthermore, and most importantly, it allows anyone to go out and become entrepreneurs or innovators by way of the protocol.

I understand the anger and discontent with BFL, I really do. At the risk of sounding like I'm defending their business practices (which I'm not), I think your analyses or characterization is just a bit more than biased. 
I've been involved with bitcoin for some time and as stupid and socially-dumb as much of the BFL instances have been, your comment calling this whole thing a troll is odd. "Unnecessarily making it a 'bitcoin transaction' ... " Erm, there's a reason we're all trying to use bitcoin and educate people. Right? Some would say fiat is "unnecessary."
It's pretty amazing that a house is in the media getting bought for bitcoin. The person in question is known to have started mining in 2009 and has helped quite a bit with the development and adoption of bitcoin, outside of the average or normal social/media/forum circles. That's not to negate other actions, but something to put in perspective when putting all the pieces together.

You bring up valuable discussion and is something that should be talked about. 
Without looking at anyone else's responses, I'll give you a few reasons as seen from this perspective. I see the behemoth financing, voting, governing contract system (among many other yet unimagined possibilities) as inadequate for the callings of the populated and educated future. There is a chance that Bitcoin can breath new life into all of those old systems - through channels we thought impossible. 
It seems you downplay the risk and manipulation of the current "system" in all its breadth - let's not kid ourselves of the corruption and greed throughout much of the world's leadership. An old truth is an old truth. 
What were the odds and risk associated with Bitcoin two years ago? What if the Vegas odds on Bitcoin succeeding and making a difference were 1 in 1000? What were the odds one year ago? What about today? We *can* change the world for better with Bitcoin. Or bring about the robot alpacalypse... or The Jetsons.  
There's a broad new dawn in the palms of our hands with the internet and Bitcoin. What are the odds?

You have a valid point with legitimate criticisms, no doubt. Though, you speak in such a manner that indicates a lack of awareness or proper perspective in regards to "the people involved with $¥€£." 
Do you think "they" or their "leadership" have any right or claim to honest or trustworthy or pacific behavior?  Do they deserve to be trusted by the people of this planet? 
Surely there are good and bad in all involved, but we should be careful trying to pigeonhole entire groups or supposed groups of people.

OP's thrust is that there are negative associations to be had - while so-called fiat has just as many or more "negative associations." 
Bitcoin and fiat: the two aren't mutually exclusive nor oppositional. As a matter of fact, the two can work together in harmony to create a fairer, more sustainable, and equitable economic and financial system; one better protected from the follies and foibles of wo/man. 
Bitcoin provides the means to fiscal conservativism, security and transparency. These three characteristics are something a large majority agree to be as valuable and important for well-functioning and sustainable governance or regulation. Without such characteristics, the majority will find and move for justified recourse and redress of grievances. The invisible hand is in the distance... hard to tell if it's the bird or the "ok" sign.

I was just thinking the same thing. It makes me excited to see the positivity in mainstream media. Bitcoin can [and will] dramatically change governance for the better.

I appreciate a lot of what you're saying. Though, I don't necessarily agree that the State is a "predator." Perhaps our current institution of the state is predatory, but it's not a prequalification, so to speak. 
In the far reaches of humanity, hopefully we won't need the State (I think you'd agree). What is guiding our livelihood and reproduction at that state? I'd say each person's self - that could be called "the State" at that point. Would you yourself be a predator then, by that logic?

Though, by its very nature and virtue... Bitcoin and public-ledger technology is, in-fact, *more* trustworthy than the backroom deals we see in the political theaters' auctioning of votes, say, or bureaucratic accounting malpractice, *perhaps*.

We need to push with more (organized) advertising and marketing. We need more public/collective funds to run television, newspaper, and magazine ads with basic information and credence pointing to/quoting articles/outlets like this one here. We need more celebrities to get on board and/or speak the f up, stat. 
Bitcoin will not be usurped. It cannot nor will not be co-opted. The banking/financial industry is going to find out real quickly, the hard way if need be, that this technology/invention was made to make the world a more equitable and fair place for everyone - and that will happen, indubitably. It's not here to siphon from the poor and disenfranchised. Try to do as much and Lehman pain will be something they wished for.

You're probably the type of person that smells a person's fart and then tells them what they had for lunch. Man/woman, I *know* what I had for lunch, ok? Kidding... not personal, at all.  
Why are we in Bitcoin if we aren't going to think *differently* about how to do things? Why are the banks in Bitcoin? They'd better be in it to make good on broken business models and promises. We need to think differently than the standard ol' way to "bank" and or be a "bank." 
How about this: a loan that's not tied to some $200/day coke-head Wall-Street nutsack. How about a loan that is somehow tied to the neighborhood you live in or the streets of the city or a vacation for your grandchildren or a bum on the street or ... what?

Campaign financing will be a great use for public shared ledgers. Voting itself would be verified and the protocol, in whatever form, used for basic tallying, also. Non-profit organizations can keep open books. Heck, even some for-profits may keep books open. Many other potential uses are out there for a more open governing or bureaucratic system.

Both of those reasons don't address the fundamental technological innovation that is the blockchain. In the context of government and democracy there is now available a financial, as well as informational, platform able to be used or observed by anyone for free. 
Number one, the funding amount, quantity, and from who, quality, can be easily implemented into bitcoin. Funding limits can be easily observed and verified. Campaign expenditures can be observed.  
Number two is a legitimate concern, but just seems like a goofy, willing disregard for easily implemented safeguards. 
In number one there's complaint about too much anonymity and in number two you complain about too little anonymity. Bitcoin and its development doesn't occur by itself, all alone. If you don't think something akin to the blockchain with "side-chains" (or whatever subsidiary-like off-shoot you want to call it) can advance a more democratic or equal governing system, then I suppose I respect your deeply cynical opinion, but don't agree with it.
