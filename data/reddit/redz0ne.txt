Really great start!
If I may give some constructive crits.
The edges of the tumblers could use a bit of chamfering on the edges to smooth out those sharp edges a bit. If you're using a smoother (not sure the blender equivalent but in Max it'd be turbosmooth or something like that to increase the mesh density) I'd consider separating the booleaned numerals by smoothing groups (again, this is a "max-ism" but I believe blender has an equivalent.)
Also... don't forget to dirty it up a bit when you get to the texturing/shader stage! Things like ambient occlusion baked into the corners, some little nicks and scuffs... maybe even adding a very slight noise map to the bump map to simulate that these tumblers usually have a bit of texture to them (I'd probably make the size small so you get a lot of small nicks, bumps and such and also make the effect minimized so that it's not actually altering the geometry or making the dents/imperfections too drastic.)

The links that it recommends where you can DL VLC for some uBTC is the one that I clicked there and it infected my computer.

The link seems to be from freedigitalmoney.
... Yeah, I know, "caveat emptor" and all that. Still, if they're affiliating themselves with online predatory means it might be worth dropping them or posting an alert on the wiki page that states that the sites are dangerous/risky.
edit: reason I suggest this is because bitcoin is gaining spread and increased public awareness but not everyone that's in to it is the typical web-savvy types that kept it alive during it's formative years. And if people say "I tried it and my computer became infected" that is a negative end-user experience and bad-press spreads wider, faster than good-press.

I think the best way to do that would be to separate "currency" from "income" in terms of the logistics.
I mean, bitcoins ARE a form of currency but their volatile nature (the values going up and down and all around) means that it's not stable enough to really be considered currency as it would be to consider it a form of income (since income is about the value whereas currency seems to be about the unit... So, when one bitcoin can be valued from $1 to $100, that means that it's not logistically sound to consider it anything other than income.)
tldr: Treat it as a value and not a unit of measurement.

Remember what was said about bitcoin a while back?

That's kinda what you get with an unregulated market.

Many regrets.
Plenty tragic.
How scorned.

   Such impressed.
Many wags!

Early adopters... $400... Might want to rethink calling them "Early" adopters.
