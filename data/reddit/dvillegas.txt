Very clear now. Gold is not very useful as a medium of exchange and bitcoin is. So, Bitcoin fulfills better than gold two very important attributes: scarcity and usefulness as a medium of exchange.

I got your point. Intrinsic value for you is a inherent purpose to achieve a goal (scarcity of Bitcoins for instance). In that sense is there any physical good (gold, diamonds, art paints) to be used as a "source of value" with "intrinsic value"?.

You didn't understand what I wrote. In fact, I agree with you. What I have written is precisely that gold gets its main value from its potential "utility" and just a very little value coming from its intrinsic characteristics (the objective fact that can be used to industrial uses for example). 
You wrote: 
1) It is scarce. Notice that scarcity is not intrinsic to gold. It is a property you cannot detect however thoroughly you examine a gold bullion.
But I didn't write anywhere that "scarcity" is a intrinsic property of gold. What I wrote is that "scarcity" is one of the properties that make gold valuable.

Clear, but then if the tx volume is not large enough it can happen an increase of the transaction fees, erasing one of the very good points of bitcoin (very low fees)

So, basically one of the strong points everyone is talking about (the very low transaction fees) is unclear. And if Bitcoin is devoted primarily to large value transactions that require this level of assurance then what is going to happen with all the "micro-payment" scenario?.

I thought the cost of mining is related with the number of transactions and the speed of the "proof of work" but not with the bitcoin market price itself. The number of miners will be related with the number and the value of the transactions.

You are linking two different things. If bitcoin would be adopted as a store of value in the same % than gold the value would be similar and the costs would remain. So, nothing to see the value with the cost

But they assure that bitcoins are safe with them
This is what they claim in its website:
Up to 97% of customer funds are stored offline
Offline storage provides an important security measure against theft or loss.
We distribute bitcoin geographically in safe deposit boxes and vaults around the world.
I would really appreciate if you can tell me why is not safe. I mean, I have some Bitcoins with them and I would like to understand why you say that is not safe.

Thanks you for your comment, you are right about not to back ultimately gold with fiat money. My meaning was more related with the need for gold to be converted to money before being used to any other use than store of value. In the past gold used to be a medium of exchange but not any more.

This is clear but in a certain point, as supply is finite, the "reward" is going to disappear and beyond this point, just then "transactions fee" will be the incentive for the miners and consequently, fees will tend to increase erasing one of the benefits of Bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-11-25 20:25:28
Agree. This is exactly my point. I have edited the article to make this point clear. My understanding is that, precisely because of the confusion about "physical attributes" and "digital attributes" a lot of people are thinking Bitcoins do not value anything because of their immateriality. Bitcoin has intrinsic value because of its digital properties

The main utility of gold nowadays is as a "store of value" meaning that in a way, gold is backed up by fiat money ($, euros, etc..) because in order to use gold to get to another thing, you need first to convert it in traditional money

I am using coinbase

Then, I assume that miners quitting will mean less resources to do the proof of work and therefore more time needed to validate each transaction or same amount of time but decreasing the complexity of the proof of work (less security in the system).
If fees adjusting is a possibility, cannot it happen that one of the main incentives for users and merchants about using bitcoins disappear?

You touched a point that has been in my mind for a long time: there could be a situation where "decentralization" has to be sacrifice in a certain level. Being said that I just have to say that I am a true believer of the benefits and goodness of Bitcoin.
