You may want to do some more research...

This. I put $15 each on 5 paper wallet Christmas gifts way back when. Since it was such a low value, I didn’t bother making backups, just made it clear for people not to lose them.
Fast forward to now, each is worth $2500, and three of them went missing.

Could also be a key from someone’s volume or student developer account. If Microsoft figures it out they can cancel the keys.

As a Canadian, I think calling it the “main coin” is a little generous.

I'm a few years your senior, and I was tempted to buy a car too. Someone said to me, "NAMED_YOUR_PENIS_REGIS, why would you sell your asset that's gaining value for your asset that's losing value?"
It's a good point, and if you believe in bitcoin, don't sell them. If you ultimately don't, then cash out. But don't cash out everything. Keep a small bit of bitcoin, who knows.

I'm not really one to comment being in Canada, but I'm not sure if your young age (16) will help you... I hope so.

I don't think there's anything wrong with holding them if you want to take the risk. I also don't think they'll ever be worth 0 as you put it.
Hell, I'll buy all the remaining ones for $20 if that's ever the case, and even then, they're still worth something.
If I had won, I'd put them in cold storage for at least a few months to see what happens, but ultimately it's his choice.

Bitcoin is going to shoot up in the next day.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:47:29
I'm in the same boat. Just hodling everything. No regrets!

Only the gains. If you spend $2000, the price goes up, and you sell a bunch for $2000, you don't report anything.
Now you're still holding onto a bit. Theoretically, if you turn around and sell that for another $2000, that $2000 is taxable.

He knew what it was and was interested. I was talking about it with my friend, and he overheard us - said he had been meaning to get a wallet going and visit the ATM (we're in Vancouver). I had him download the Blockchain.info app and sent him 0.03BTC when we were done our meal.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it's 27 - 34 characters.
@_date: 2013-10-27 22:44:48
Oh man I'm seriously laughing hard now.
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:37:13
That's one thing I'm concerned about. The screen says that it could take up to an hour for the transaction to be sent. That hasn't happened yet, and the transaction was completed 2 hours ago.

It is. And it would probably be better if it came out face down.

Not sure about Toronto. Bitcoiniacs has 4 other machines on order which I believe will be stationed around the country, and I'm sure one of them will land in Toronto.

There are two parts - a private key and an address. The address is what you share with people, and the private key allows you to spend the bitcoins associated with an address.

Speaking of which, I tipped in bitcoin the other day. Was cool.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:54:47
Seriously made me laugh. Thanks.

When I got to the coffee shop, there was a line of around 4 people for the machine. Bitcoiniacs was on site helping everyone sign up.
When you set up your palm scan, you have to scan it 6 times. Then, you enter your email address, and that information is sent to Bitcoiniacs. They have to approve the account before you can do any transactions. They approved it right away (they were standing right next to me), and I was able to shoot this video.
While I was waiting in line, there was a slight issue with the network - my limited tech knowledge makes me think an API went down somewhere along the way. This happened after someone had deposited their money but before the transaction completed. Bitcoiniacs refunded the cash and they tried again. It took them about 5 minutes to get it running again.
I was surprised at the demographic of people buying coins. There were a couple young adults and enthusiasts, but for the most part while I was there, it was older folks who didn't fully understand it, but wanted to get involved and learn more.  There was a woman who had to be pressing 80 who wanted to buy coins.
I think the ATM is an incredible thing to have, and is definitely serving it's purpose of making bitcoin more accessible - even on day 1.
