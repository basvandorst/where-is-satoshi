You should have just placed some bitcoin stickers there.

Where is the youtube link?

It's arguably more real than the paper money you are used to.
@_date: 2016-11-14 15:13:39
They can't tell how much cash I have or what transactions I'm doing with it either..

It's a necessary step so people can realize they don't truly need the diesiel engine in their tesla's.

Thank you I've been wondering.

Why in the fuck would you censor it? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:01:11
Well, then, who knows? It's dropping rapidly now, but one week is a LONG time for bitcoin, anything can change.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:49:30
You can have as many wallets as you need. There are no rules.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:06:35
You want to send yourself bitcoins? You mean from different address where you have them? What client are you using?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:21:25
Woah, dude. Some of those girls almost make me puke.
@_date: 2013-10-24 14:51:35
What does taking money out of MtGox has to do with anything? You sell/buy practically instantly and money stays in your account. Taking them out of account has nothing to do with price drop/rise.

You guys are really starting to get annoying.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:45:12
Alright, fee is back from the first bet. I placed [second bet]( (even before fee from the first came back), it got confirmed only after 500+ minutes. Nothing came back. I tried to [look it up]( but doesnt show up. The first one shows up correctly there.

What is this?
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:54:28
We need to get people into USING bitcoin not ABUSE it. Most of them don't even care what you can really do with bitcoins as currency. Most just care to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:34:28
I have never need to pay any of those fees at my bank. Why wouldnt you switch?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:07:23
Same here, dammit. I keep looking at charts and refreshing reddit.

He has big, expensive apartment in the middle of city for less than $27. Yeah, he must feel like such a fool.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:26:15
That ain't funny, Jimmy.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:32:51
I mean, usually I get back the transaction fee but now nothing.
EDIT: You can see here: 
 in my wallet, that I sent it but nothing came back since then!
@_date: 2013-04-25 11:30:10
You're trying too hard.

Correction incoming!

Duh. Guess how many try to get there now.
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:16:43
..because the US government says it has intrinsic value.

I personally think it's just question of when the application of bitcoin will be made that really displays the true power of bitcoin and goes really viral, because lot of people still didn't even hear about bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:42:35
And then you charge back, muhahaha.

Teach them phrase which will unlock encrypted wallet data which you print many times.

Everyone will have the whole list of items on their pc and synchronize with each other. Like we synchronize blocks with bitcoin.

It's now selling for 500€.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:52:26
It's nice to know that people like you are leaving. We, the rest, will stay here for the right cause.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:44:16
There are several exchanges around that will convert government currency into bitcoin and other way around. [MtGox]( is the most popular one, [Btc24]( is an option too.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:29:27
Woah, time to go and buy some champagne?

Same here dude! Cheers!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:34:03
I don't understand what makes one think anyone would be interested in reading a post like this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:28:18
It's sending from address to another.

How. Can. One. Know?
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:59:41
FOR THE BITCOIN!
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:04:11
How can one know?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:08:26
Go to Funding Options, Deposit, Bitcoins, copy the address there, send bitcoins to the address, done.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:32:43
"according to Mt.Gox, the virtual currency's biggest exchange." False.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:00:50
Miners keep the bitcoin network "alive". They confirm other people's transactions and for that they are rewarded.
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:24:23
That guy is hilarious. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:40:50
And why doesn't it return the transaction fee then? Is there a way to check if I lost other than the app?

EDIT: Nvm. Works now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:54:40
Oh, okay.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:39:52
Even worse is that no one can really tell that they are lost. Who knows how many out of those ~11M in circulation are lost already.
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:20:06
Yes, we have Euro. For over 4 years.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:43:11
People have asked this at 50, at 100, at 150, now you are asking and many more will come to ask if it is or isn't too late to jump on crazy bitcoin train. Hop on before it rises more.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:04:54
I placed another bet and something returned, but not sure if from the first one or second one. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:55:06
Well.. it's time for BITCOINS!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:25:29
Ouch! Someone bought the ones scared people sold.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:55:34
If you call 4 years old "brand new", then yes.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:02:11
I hope it's real. It has potential to change so much. Economy revolution or common "internet money".

This entertainment might be worth a lot someday.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:18:29
I just wish so much that bitcoin is used as the main internet currency. And PayPal dies along with rest.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:57:40
It is over $200 now already. Did you bet that precisely on that day it has to be over $200? And how could anyone here know if it will be or won't. All we can do is take a wild guess.
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:17:55
1. True. But same applies for all other uses of cryptography you daily use.
2. Here you can see:  150 contributors and you can fork it and request pull.
3. I think the cryptography that is used would need to be broken for this.
4. What happens when someones pays someone cash and doesn't write a note of it? Same thing.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:20:06
get used to it

..SO WE CAN BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY

Isn't it enough when you paid taxes for electricity?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:14:22
1. So we will start scaling when it's too late?
2. What about peer-to-peer mining?
3. Very constructive.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:47:21
You misunderstood mining. Please read this:

On the right side, there is "How to buy bitcoins". How did you miss that?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:31:44
If you include transaction fee, about 10 minutes tops.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:46:11
Those comments in there make me cry.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:31:49
Price double in last 7 days, that's what he probably meant.

I don't know if I should be happy or afraid.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:38:52
Who doesn't.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:30:09
Did you just explain your situation?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:34:59
Look at the time on the charts.

More you hesitate, less bitcoins you gonna get for your precious dollars.

$200 was achieved yesterday. Now it's $200. You argument is invalid.

There should be for people like you. Basically some big fish just decided it's enough for him and sold out.
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:39:34
More you stall, more you lose.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:49:51
You realize that people ask this everyday here? And no one can predict what will happen. Choice is yours. Will you miss those 200€ when you lose them? Do you believe it will go up? Ask yourself these questions and make a decision. Better sooner than later.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:47:28
No person in the right mind would dump any number of bitcoins close to all buy orders. Would get really little money for most of them.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:01:32
Yes, for me too. It's like 8 hours since my bet, no win, no transaction fee back, nothing.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:45:10
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:28:17
20%? not really.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:23:33
People scared. People selling.

And music.

And next halving will come in 2016.

Price on MtGox affects prices on other exchanges too.. so..

Define "money".

Oh. Don't worry price looks steady now.
