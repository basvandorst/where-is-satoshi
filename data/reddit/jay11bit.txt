That algo has TSAesque manners just when the price is right for the buyer.  Anyway make a post at r/coinbase. And if you received a cancellation email from them just hit reply and state your case. Goodluck.

Aptly put!
In fact you need to buy in more and take advantage of lowering your average cost.

I think if someone managed to hack into your CB account in that case then the risk is inherent to hit your CC no less your confirmed bank account.
Personally I think you are definitely better off fighting to reverse a CC transaction than a cash one after the fact. Because a bank account has to be in place you pro'ly better off dedicating it for CB purposes only. Thus, only put cash in it when  you intend to transact at CB.
I decided to remove my cellphone no. and use Google's authenticator app only. I use a Tmobile MVNO, with no online account access setup. I think that should eliminate the risk of SMS being accessed online.
My other question then becomes is it possible for an account that's has Google authenticator to be compromised? The email address also has an GAuth. access in place.

Thank you for taking the time to do this and relaying it here. Never mind those give you flack now that your letter could have been more perfect. You were in that position and acted. I bet there were others who didn't. Nevertheless, thank you.

I appreciate the intended convenience nevertheless, those safe addys could get compromised too. I would take additional security than less of it.

Yep, perks of being a CEO. Kinda tough to offer bold organizational leadership locking oneself in a room. I will take it because this is the type of unconventional actions needed for btc to keep soaring. Next room to be locked Amazon, Tigerdirect....

Make numerous buys as you can now to tip average cost in your favor.

I can't believe that with the price at $310 you are still holding  having had so  much fiat plowed into btc.  I watched the price fall and then regain to just above $650 followed by the current decline. I was like you - was getting tired of looking at the price. I would stop but I just couldn't stop. I was trying to convince myself that I am in for the long run, price will recover and once I even out $680 I will have some comfort - when, how much to sell or hold.
I read a lot about trading and realized this thing is a gamble and no one can determine the price direction with a certainty nor the bottom itself. I also decided to think like them and set a to-heck-with-the-cheese-let-me-out value. I love btc and that's my nickname with all my friends - yep right now I am the butt of their MLM, amway, ponzi scheme jokes because I have done those too. But I steeled myself that I could only afford to lose so much and that was my comfort i.e. bet. $5500-6000. I couldn't afford the current prices, I don't know how you are holding up. When the price rebounds my btc buy in price is $100 above the bottom price for 1btc total. I hope that if it ever goes to the $10,000 or $100k great. I think the only way you can make money in btc right now is to offer a service.

$924. First bought in November/December  continued buying and sold  (my dollar cost average on that loot was abt $570). I thought it's about to tumble but it continued rising beyond $900. I read my crystal ball all kinds of wrong and thought this  is it $2k+ and I didn't want to be left at the bus stop waiting for &lt;$800. So I bought in at $924 only to see it get GOXed to $840 and waaay less. Mhhh... there must be an opportunity in this scene somewhere. Bingo! time reduce my dollar cost average. So I continued buying, numerous transactions later now my dollar cost average is  and dropping. 
I day traded upto the first 1k+ run up. Made some $ and lost, mostly and of course I was sleeping like a baby-yep, I woke up every 2 hours to check on the prices. So lost sleep too. After buying in  I haven't day traded since, I have more than replaced that stash and I catch my sleep very well, better than a drunk higher than a Georgia pine tree-that is really well. I figure after rustling and being rustled by btc's hair-trigger price you develop a keen sense of maturity in dealing with your emotions about that. Instead of watching the price I now watch the environment and the investments pouring therein to get a sense of the future. Going up with the rocket or down with the ship, but nevertheless, riding all the way.
P/s: Phew sure felt better putting that out here. The wife been watching me with that look.

And don't also that the ceo of Bitcoin was arrested recently. 
Love to watch the aftermath of octogenarians getting blindsided and knocked off by new technology.

If you operate two accounts with some items matching such as names, you will get hit with that inconvenience. Contact them, explain, they will request you close one account.
Contact some of the people you had called with your previous number and request them for the digits. Or log into your account, an old bill.

Enable 2fa,
Change password,
Change email to dummy email,
Pro'ly never transact with that account

Me thinks marry a Zimbabwean (a North Korean will work too), mix coins, open btc-fiat tap in tiny bits as and when needed but preserve most of your coins in crypto, buy into a rich hood, enjoy local beer and chill out in Mugabe land (hope Mugabe lives a lot longer too) and just don't venture into South Africa or elsewhere before verifying extradition treaties. Or simply ask any of a number of returning expatriates to Asia, Africa etc what they did. Doubt each of them cares to shake and close with IRS on that exit tax.

Granted, but that's until their super secret algorithm draped in TSAesque rabid eagerness decides to take a groping liking to ya.
