And that is where Litecoin comes in. Nobody wants to pay 0.0001 BTC for something either. It’s too clunky. I definitely see BTC as a store of value now.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:45:45
Yes lol Glad to see I'm not the only one.

Coping mechanism? I'd be excited it's heading way beyond $20K this year.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:19:19
I'm pretty sure the Tang invented the concept of paper money. Pretty revolutionary for its time, and I would certainly liken it to BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-25 03:19:43
Yeah I’ve been banned from several pages automatically without even tweeting anything to them, and I’ve had to verify I’m not a bot several times, plus Jack Dorsey is really pro-Bitcoin so I doubt Twitter is trying to hurt Bitcoin-related discussion.
@_date: 2018-08-02 04:04:22
BTC.com is literally handing out free money to celebrate the hard fork and you guys are celebrating this idiot tearing signs down. How do you not see the rabid, SJW mob mentality? You are only making yourselves look more irrational and Bitcoin Cash more legitimate whether you like it or not by doing this.

Well shit let’s not promote adoption then. This picture is highlighting crypto adoption and that PayPal is becoming obsolete, yet all we can focus on is that they dare accept bch? 
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:51:34
I'll believe it when I see it.
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:28:22
And let the triggering commence lol
@_date: 2018-06-15 01:28:07
Ohh the swastikas... �� 
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:02:10
Yup. And let the triggering commence lol.
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:51:06
Why is that though? I hear that a lot but never knew why.

A common trend I see in the daily discussion is that price is being manipulated by whales, but all I see them doing is accumulating more and more bitcoins. Are they really manipulating the price, or is it the bottom 99% that is when they (panic?) sell. Would really like some people to give insight on this, still somewhat new.
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:52:33
I’d say that makes more sense for the short term.
@_date: 2018-03-25 07:29:34
That's awesome. Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:11:05
“Unusual activity on this account.”
Yeah, I agree. Why is  shitting on Bitcoin and promoting Bcash? 
@_date: 2018-03-25 06:26:14
This post isn't about becoming rich off of .1 BTC. It's about understanding what people on the other side of the world think of bitcoin. Your comment doesn't make much sense, but given your account history all you are doing is trolling.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:11:08
Time to tether up boys! /s
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:34:04
It’s pretty funny watching roger ver get triggered over this. Too bad his Wucoin/Bcash will be obsolete pretty soon! 
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:16:57
I have to say, actually buying a Lamborghini is definitely not a wise thing to do once BTC moons again. Urgh I don’t even want to see the monthly insurance premium on that thing. There’s a reason the Winklevoss twins still drive an old SUV �� just be smart about it lol
@_date: 2018-03-25 06:52:16
You probably got burned buying at ATH ��
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:30:53
Bitcoin dominance is rising... as it should! Almost at 50% 
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:43:48
You're absolutely right and I realized it after "diversifying" into all these other altcoins. Not only do I lose money in miner fees and exchange fees, but altcoins usually take a bigger tumble when Bitcoin goes down.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:19:41
That's exactly what I was thinking lol.
@_date: 2018-03-19 07:00:40
I mean a little electricity, but it will be even much longer than 2,100 days to break even since the difficulty of mining bitcoin is only going to keep growing. It will probably end up taking 20+ years to pay off, which is ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-03-20 06:44:47
Developing a FIAT gateway that allows for PayPal? I just know there are hardly any of those and people would like them, especially given big banks’ hositility towards crypto purchases with their cards.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:33:07
Does anyone like seeing how in a sea of red, bitcoin's dominance keeps going up?
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:50:04
Really? What insider tipped you off on that? Or are you a whale???? /s
@_date: 2018-02-22 05:10:24
Unfortunately many people care more about price.
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:31:57
That's true. I saw Bitmain's wallet being in about the top 75 I believe.
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:52:19
Mmm no thanks. I’ll stick with my 2000 Honda Accord. Even if I do end up buying a car with crypto, it would be another Honda ��

I'm from Illinois, and they need alllllll the money they can get as Illinois is in a fatal amount of debt. So this doesn't surprise me as much as some other state lol
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:33:29
However Bitmain also took in more BTC than they cashed out (or sent to another address). They still cashed out like 40,000+ BTC and that would certainly affect the market.
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:45:12
Honestly. The petulance of the crypto community has seriously been turning me off lately and I’m getting tired of it. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:50:11
Perhaps this was going to happen, but because you said it, now it won’t lol I guess similar to Murphy’s Law?
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:08:23
Well put.
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:06:08
Definitely not holding my breath on crypto card providers after LitePay shitting the bed like it did.

Aaaaand you jinxed it.

I only ask since Nano is probably the most shilled coin on r/cryptocurrency and I’m trying to look past the hype.
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:10:07
You heard it here first guys! Vericoin is gonna overtake Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-07-05 23:03:34
So Nano is centralized (Which I figured)?
@_date: 2018-03-19 05:50:38
I was *almost* going to buy one but realized that sellers were price gouging the hell out of miners and decided not to. What especially dissuaded me from buying was seeing USB stick miners that mine 1/10th of a cent per day selling for ~$210. How about hell no.
@_date: 2018-07-23 05:09:42
$6 for a cone of ice cream? I don’t think the ice cream truck would be in business for long with those prices, even in 2018. And just set your tx for a lower fee when sending the BTC. Of course the trade off is it’ll be in the mempool longer but it’s just an ice cream, not a lambo. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:20:38
"So what does the 'H' stand for in Bitcoin (BCH)?"
God, these Bcash people are idiots. 90% of r/btc is bashing on Bitcoin when, if Bcash is so good, they should be talking about its positives.

Great way to lure you into their website lol Wish I knew of this coffee shop when I was in Prague last winter!
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:01:17
HOLY SHIT. I just checked the market after a couple days. I’m pretty happy haha
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:28:11
I agree, but this doesn’t just go for BTC, it goes for all alts as well. I think a lot of people are kidding themselves into thinking how great *their* coin is, when it really isn’t all it’s cut out to be. I’m just becoming pretty jaded about how this coin or that coin is going to moon for really no substantial reason. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 10:12:35
Well... I hope he didn’t lose his seed phrase also, as opposed to the *other* kind of seed he spilled
