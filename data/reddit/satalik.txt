Transactions on an order book would not be counted, that’s all off chain. Transactions to and from your exchange would count.

I wanna down vote because you used an ad hominem but you’re also 100% correct so I’m going to have to upvote you instead.

Wow... Has this happened with BTC? If so is there a comparable resource?

I agree but I’d suggest you are probably also smart enough to not pick someone’s name who is closely associated with you.

Care to expand? Not disagreeing, just curious.

Yes that was Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. He is known to have a technical and finance background though so I don’t know if techno noob is the best way to characterize him. He’s also done an AMA that made me think he must surely be Satoshi. I don’t think we will ever be sure. Many experts who analyzed Hal’s writings against Satoshi say it definitely wasn’t Hal though.
