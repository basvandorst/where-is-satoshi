I think progress is almost never purely good nor purely bad.  Fiat currencies and central banks evolved as a response to real problems and generally have functioned in a way to make economies work more efficiently, at least in terms of aggregate wealth creation and innovation.  On the downside, it can exacerbate problem like inequality, rent seeking, regulatory capture, overconsumption, etc etc etc.  I think there can be honest debate about the pros vs cons and how best to move forward.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:52:08
Sure.   But that doesn't mean those economies functioned better than modern economies.
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:12:23
I think the article is more or less correct on the premise.  Decentralization basically removes a lot of the recent "progress" in the way that currencies, economies, and monetary policies behave.  I think a lot of crypto enthusiasts basically disagree if that progress was mostly good or mostly bad.  Going back to a hard currency is not exactly a new idea.
The economy of the dreams of many of these libertarians looks a lot like the economies of hundreds of thousands years ago.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:45:04
A deflationary currency is horrible for an economy.  A currency should be mildly inflationary (2-3%) to encourage savers to invest their money in *productive* assets instead of hoarding cash under a mattress.
@_date: 2018-08-05 03:05:36
It's not inherently useful though.  In fact, you don't want a currency to have inherent value.  
Even if a lot of stores start accepting Bitcoin, why would a person spend any bitcoins if the value of it kept increasing?  Wouldn't everyone just hoard their bitcoins in expectation of it becaming more valuable?

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (and currencies) aren't really investments in a true sense.  You just are betting on someone else being willing to pay more for it in the future for something that has no instrinic value.

I don't think low fraud is a feature of BTC right now.  Probably the opposite.  For merchants the problem is that it's more important to make the sale using whatever payment methods customer want to use.  Merchants don't generally want to lose customers over not taking credit cards or other traditional methods.  My credit cards offer ease of use, fraud protection, and cash back rewards, so I really don't see many people choosing to use BTC instead.

This is not a difference in the "technology".  This is a trade-off of accepting regulations in order to achieve mass adoption.  If a payment method is designed to circumvent regulations, then governments will make sure that using that method is cumbersome enough to never achieve mass adoption.

Fiat is not supposed to be a long term store of value.  Inflation is a feature that encourages productive investments by making loans easier to pay off and incentivizing people to lend/invest money rather just hoarding fiat.

Huh?  And BTC has no investment risk???? 
Hoarding money makes it *more* difficult for productive people to get loans to increase their productivity (capital investments).

That's the first time I've heard someone claiming that debtors are stealing from savors even if they don't default.  You do know that loan agreements usually incorporate interest right?  Those who loan out fiat are under no obligation to loan out their money unless the terms are favorable.
@_date: 2019-02-11 19:55:13
If that were true than there would not ever be a reason to hold BTC.  Just like there's no reason to hold Venmo credit.  If on the other hand we expect the value of BTC to increase over time vs fiat, then there becomes no reason to *spend* BTC and not just hoard it for the long term.

It's not the volatility that's the problem.  BTC/USD can be as volatile as you want and it's not a problem if stuff you need to pay for is priced in BTC and you hold BTC.  Volatility is only a problem when you hold BTC because stuff is priced in fiat.

Bitcoin has the potential to be a better currency assuming it stablizes.  However gold has thousands of years of history of being a store of value through depressions, world wars, and collapses of civilizations.

There's no reason they would do that.

@_date: 2019-01-12 04:38:46
With that logic, they should buy one of every single possible investment, including all the alts.  Who's to say that if the dollar falls, it's not guaranteed that BTC will replace it.

There's a huge difference between a recession or crisis isolated to Greece compared to a potential global slowdown lead by the US.

The same could be said of Bitcoin and crypto in general.

There is no limit.  It's debt to GDP ratios that matter anyway, not the nominal figure.  And it's also not a cliff where if you hit some magic number it all collapses.  It all depends on how a country's economy is functioning.

How about technology like TV, computers, and cell phone?  Don't just cherry pick specific items that might have increased faster than overall inflation.  Although it is true that the minimum wage has lagged behind inflation, the average wage has not

Slightly inflationary currencies have the generally positive effect of encouraging long term investments via borrowing as it makes debts cheaper in real terms over time.  It also encourages people with excess savings to invest their savings rather than hoard currency.
  There are plenty of productive things that can be used as a store of value (commodities, real estate, etc).  You don't need your currency to act as one.

Venzuela is experiencing a currency crisis, not a normal recession.  Even in a financial crisis like 2008, the value of USD went up, not down.

Bubbles might disappear because you'll be in a permanent depression.

Yes but a lot of that is because when Bitcoin prices started going up, media (and celebrity) coverage of it did too.  So the causal direction is unclear.

The point of money is to make economic transactions more efficient than bartering.  If you want a store of value, don't use cash.

You should care about both.  If you have bills due in fiat and only own crypto, the collectors won't care that it may be a down time in crypto prices due to market fluctuations.  It's called permanent loss risk.

Lol it doesn't necessarily have to be less volatile in terms of other currencies but does have to be stable against the value of real goods.  One BTC can't be worth a lambo one day and a bicycle the next.

It is ironic that Bitcoin is made a lot of people care more about how much fiat they have.
@_date: 2018-12-27 05:41:39
Non inflationary currencies were the standard for most of human history.  Most of the world moved towards fiat currencies because it works better for modern economies.

No one "has" to buy in at any price.  If I miss the boat on an investment, I don't go chasing and buy it regardless if the price represents good value or not.

You may see Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat, but that doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of people see it as a speculative investment.
@_date: 2018-12-28 05:47:55
I don't see how it would not affect you unless you never have bills to pay or you only have excess wealth in crypto, in which case that's fine as that's how you have to treat a speculative asset.  My point is that if you want to argue that it is a replacement for fiat currencies, the volatility is absolutely a problem.
@_date: 2018-12-31 07:50:33
only gold or crypto?  How about productive assets with some instrinic value instead?
