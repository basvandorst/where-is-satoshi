I agree with you, the economics are shaky at best… But I will give the author this. Many people around here run full nodes in order to contribute to the robustness of the network. 
If the recompensation from running a mining rig makes it so that the net cost of running a miner is equal to the net cost of running a node, (which is uncompensated) then some people may consider mining for that reason
I don't know if I am that person. But likely there are others out there who are

Large public corporations currently have to spend mega-millions on accounting costs in order to stay compliant. Private blockchains will allow them to handle their internal accounting practices at a fraction of the cost.

You're allowed to own things as a minor, including Bitcoin. 
I think what you're really thinking of is, is it legal for someone to sell it to me? That answer is dependent on local laws etc., but the responsible party would be the seller, not yourself as a minor. 
TL;DR - You're fine
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:06:42
Slightly off-topic, and I'm sure there has been discussion about this... but Coinbase should consider buying or starting a mining operation in WA or somewhere profitable internationally in order to hedge their costs

If price goes to the moon because we are able to improve bitcoin, implement layer 2, reach consensus and stop the outflow to alt coins, then wouldn't  their relative fees be higher?
In other words, even if they're mining half as many transactions, if BTC is worth $4k don't they come out ahead?

Kanishka Sukumar, a consultant who works in midtown Manhattan, says his parents often stash money in gold for safekeeping. But the 24-year-old thinks there is a better place for his savings.
"In times of financial turmoil, I would prefer to see a portfolio full of bitcoin,” said Mr. Sukumar, who holds about one-third of his wealth in the digital currency.
Bitcoin is gaining traction with modern-day gold bugs who question the stability of paper currencies or worry about protecting their savings during the next financial crisis.
A recent survey of 3,500 bitcoin users found that one in five hold the cryptocurrency because they don’t want banks or the government “controlling my money,” according to data provider CoinDesk. That was the second-biggest reason for holding bitcoin, behind owning it as an investment.
Since its inception seven years ago, bitcoin has shared an appeal similar to gold’s for those who want to hold their money outside of central authority. But as its dramatic price swings have eased, bitcoin has started to look like a more viable store of wealth to some of its fans.
“It’s an ‘I-don’t-trust-people’ purchase,” said Michael Novogratz, a bitcoin owner and hedge-fund manager who left Fortress Investment Group LP last fall.
He thinks bitcoin can attract some of those people who would otherwise turn to gold. While Mr. Novogratz said he has a “significant” holding in bitcoin, he owns only one ounce of gold, which, he added, was a gift.
 
In April, volatility in bitcoin’s price fell below that of gold for 28 consecutive days, the longest period in its history. Bitcoin volatility also briefly dropped below that of another flight-to-safety trade, the Japanese yen, according to data from FactSet and CoinDesk.
Bitcoin has become popular for fast, anonymous transactions. The number of bitcoin wallets, or electronic accounts used for paying with the cryptocurrency, doubled in 2015 to more than 12 million, according to data provider CoinDesk.
The cryptocurrency has also attracted traders looking to profit from its sometimes volatile price movements. The New York Stock Exchange tracks bitcoin’s price, and the derivatives marketplace CME Group said this month it is developing a bitcoin spot-price index.
Murat Akdeniz, a 25-year-old business student at Cornell University, said his daily bitcoin trading activity has declined with bitcoin’s volatility. Now it makes more sense to buy and hold the currency, of which he owns about 10 coins, he said.
Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance also reflects his generation’s growing trust of technology over governments, said Mr. Akdeniz. "If China decides to sell their gold reserves, my bitcoin price won’t be affected negatively,” he added.
Some investors cited economic uncertainty as another reason to hold bitcoin, especially as recession fears have roiled markets and central banks around the world have cut interest rates into negative territory.
Bitcoin has become “a store of value for those concerned about other asset classes,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. “Gold used to be the only refuge for those who have grave concerns over the global economy and monetary system.”
Gold is often viewed as a haven, with many investors trusting it to hold its value better than paper currencies. During the Greek crisis last summer, investors looking for safety flooded into both gold and bitcoin, traders and bitcoin exchange firms said.
“I like [bitcoin] as a hedge against an economic collapse,” Brian Estes, a 48-year-old venture capitalist in St. Louis, said. Holding the digital currency, he added, is like having a “hedge against the ATMs and the banking systems not being functional for a while.”
Not everyone is convinced bitcoin’s future is bright. The cryptocurrency faces regulatory hurdles around the world and in the past suffered from wild price fluctuations. It was used on the former online black market, Silk Road, for illegal drug purchases, law-enforcement officials have said.
Some are more bullish on the technology that underpins bitcoin than the digital asset itself. Peter Grosskopf, chief executive of Sprott Inc., said the blockchain system—a data structure that makes it possible to create and share a digital ledger of transactions—behind cryptocurrencies has the potential to improve gold transactions. But he doesn’t see any tangible value in bitcoin.
“We will invest in the digitization of gold, but we’re going to stick with gold,” Mr. Grosskopf said.
The gold market dwarfs bitcoin. The amount of money in bitcoin is estimated at $6.8 billion by bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain. The over-the-counter gold market trades between $150 billion and $240 billion a day, according to the World Gold Council. Holdings in gold-backed ETFs are close to $80 billion.
Murray Stahl, chief investment officer of Horizon Kinetics, which manages $6 billion in assets, said as bitcoin becomes more established, he plans to buy more cryptocurrencies in place of gold.
Horizon Kinetics holds shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust , the first publicly traded bitcoin investment vehicle. Mr. Stahl said his exposure to bitcoin comprises between 0.5% and 1% in several portfolios, compared with 3% to 4% holdings in gold-related securities.
“I’m not ready to give up entirely on gold,” Mr. Stahl said. But “in the next 10 years, there will be a cryptocurrency alternative.”

Market Cap is the dumbest way to measure crypto. Volume matters.
If there is one sale of watermelon is the entire world, and you decide to give me $1mil for it, does that mean that the value of watermelons is $1 trillion because there are 100,000 watermelons sitting it a field somewhere?
Market cap is used to describe the value of a company, not the cumulative value of a specific commodity.

1. Find a nearby asteroid with easily accessible and plentiful gold
2. design a machine that mines gold autonomously

4. Get the payload safely back to earth

I really enjoyed watching this. I can see there's a lot of potential with the open-ended gameplay. I thought the music was well-done in that it seems to match the vibe of the gameplay (floating in the ether etc.) perhaps more variety would be good, one or two more tracks. Or, perhaps a way to have the music respond to the actions/explosions as they happen. (Like that Brian Eno iOS game a few years ago where it constructed scales/patterns based on touch and color)
This also seems like it's begging for an oculus port, although I'm sure that's not at the top of the list seeing as it's still limited in adoption. (Orange ots an even better reason to port it, since your get into that market on the ground floor)
One other comment - not sure if it was my screen, but it seems like in every instance but the last galaxy in the video the overall brightness was a little bit too low for me. The cool colors came out real well but the warm reds, greys etc sort of blended into each other and made it difficult to see the edges of objects.
Overall it looks like a very cool game and a promising concept. Congrats and best of luck!

I get the impression that these are precious metals guys from the Kitco forums that have migrated over to the crypto space. Not terribly sophisticated folks, but they're convinced that the dollar is fucked and primarily like to talk about gold/silver/Bitcoin going to the moon all day.

Don't know, never tried it… The weekly limit I have comes out of my bank account.  I verified my ID with a credit card… I think that helped raise my limits, but the money always comes from my checking account

I have a $2000 weekly instant limit, I get my BTC right away with the standard 1% fee.. maybe because I have a good credit rating? I don't know. I hear about the fees people pay with the debit card and I don't understand it. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 08:22:10
Right, but there are 2 posts a day from 19-year olds who don't realize that if you send money from a bank to an overseas gambling operation then the bank is going to be pissed. It would be nice to prevent those situations by making them aware that they can't do certain things with CB

I know what you mean! The goddamn automobile industry had to come along and put the horse and buggy industry out of business with their dirty mass-produced vehicles. Those horses only ever produced poop and instead of expensive gasoline they ate carrots.

He was being a dick - ETH is an inflationary currency, meaning they'll always make more, as opposed to BTC which is a fixed supply (or deflationary)

Don't make things too complicated. Buy bitcoins and hold them on your own wallet. Be your own bank and enjoy the capital appreciation of a deflationary currency.
