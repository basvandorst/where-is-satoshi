Good catch!

First, they’re kids. Second, they might’ve intentionally spelled it that way because they aimed to donate all money to charity.

“Aid” meaning “to help” would make a better pun . . .
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:21:45
What do we call it?

The picture says nothing about cigarettes. Those are the prices for a liter of 100-octane and 95-octane gasoline, respectively.

Oh, now I see. Well, I can assure you it has nothing to do with racism.
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:04:44
Network effects!

Again, I’ve even posted the link to an original thread here.
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:29:45
Not everyone would click on the YouTube logo.

Premium cigarettes cost about $1.60 per pack.

Two hours is way too much to download any QR scanner app to your smartphone and make sure the QR codes from both threads are identical. And you're calling me a douche, wow. Way to go!

Original thread: 
Didn’t know it had been posted here. No offense, fellow crypto advocates. :)

@_date: 2018-08-21 21:40:44
I saved this one long time ago. Just wanted to share.
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:45:11
God, just download any QR scanner app and compare two codes. They're identical.
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:52:08
They are just tracking the price.
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:12:01
No need to be a “crypto nerd” to spot the Bitcoin price there—with such a big font size, it’s hard to miss. Normally, people look at these screens to check the time or the exchange rate of their national currency, not the ad. :)

OP, could’ve given credit to creators of this vid: [
P.S. I wonder why this isn’t getting that many upvotes. Hilarious af.
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:35:17
I think that since this was their dad’s idea in the first place, he might’ve wanted to create the wallet instead of (or in addition to) a savings account, believing the kids could sell BTC at a much higher price later in their life—for example, when they graduate from high school and need money to pay college tuition or something like that.
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:25:34
Haha, that’s hilarious ��

If one bought in back in 2009 and hasn’t sold up to this point, their ROI is still unimaginable.
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:32:42
The more exposure, the better. Now waiting for this gas station network to start accepting payments in cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:20:14
And how is that?
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:44:30
Never was my intention.
@_date: 2018-08-22 09:29:45
Because I didn’t know it had been posted already.
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:34:23
Come and see yourself! :)
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:39:11
Nice observation. Didn’t know that, thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-08-22 06:06:35
Big up on that!
@_date: 2018-08-22 06:01:41
From Wikipedia:
_There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends, but demographers and researchers typically use the mid-1990s to mid-2000s as starting birth years. At the present time, there is little consensus regarding ending birth years._
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:41:34
Apology accepted! :)
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:14:29
You make a good point.
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:42:57
Some serious entrepreneurial skills here!
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:41:40
That’s exactly what I meant, thanks!

Just as I’ve said before a couple times in this thread already, the photo is not mine and I found it on and saved it from Twitter long time ago. Do not know whether it has been modified compared to the original thread posted here in December.
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:43:47
Would you please be so kind as to not accuse anyone of anything without being able to provide any proof behind your allegations?
I just downloaded three different QR scanner applications from the App Store, and they all show the same Bitcoin address in the picture both here and in the original thread.
Regarding the quality, I downloaded the image from Twitter, and it may be compressing them; hence the bad quality.

There is no military junta in Ukraine.
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:44:16
It’s the same as the one posted in the original thread. You may easily verify that yourself. :)
