Yeah I can see that. I know financial firms are looking into blockchain tech for trade settling, etc.
The one I'm staking is called blocknet.  It's been around since 2014 but kind of under the radar.  They are aiming to be a decentralized exchange/the internet of blockchains - kind of connecting different contracts and coins through their protocol.  So I see it as a gamble on the the entire crypto space since if it gets mass adoption, stakers/nodes will continue to get rewards as long as the blockchain is functional.  That's the type of stuff I'm looking for that would probably survive even if the major cryptos right now don't.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:05:30
Well for me, it's the fact that your portfolio goes up a ton and then you start worrying if you should take your profits or move some btc to something else (probably frowned upon here but there is a lot of money to be made in alts).  Then you stress more when you didn't make a move and the market collapses 50%.  It's just stressful trying to navigate and worry about lost opportunity costs.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:12:02
Some alts do if you know where to look.  I'm making $80-150 a day in one certain coin by staking it and it has been relatively stable even when btc was going way up.  I think those types of coins are where people should be looking if they have a large portfolio because if crypto takes off and becomes the future, you can retire on staking rewards and dividend like coins.  And I fully realize it's a complete gamble at this point in time since we are in the biggest bull market crypto has ever seen.
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:11:09
Blocknet and neblio mainly.  Neblio just skyrocketed for some reason.  Not sure why. I haven't been paying attention to be honest.  Blocknet is like Ark but it's been in development longer and very much under the radar right now.  Big things are coming in the first quarter of 2018 though and they just hired a marketing team and head of marketing so I would imagine people will start to learn about it soon.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:18:41
I'll see if my friends there can get it for me.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:08:04
Seriously.  I've only been in btc for a little over 4 years and i used to send it around and buy shit all the time and it was cheap and quick.  This is a mass adoption problem and the network is too clogged up now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:05:31
There always was that option though.  Bitmex and Bitfinex offered it as far as I know.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:30:30
Definitely the most accurate. Then you start getting angry when it goes down and you watch your dollars evaporate in minutes.  You need to remind yourself that you are still up a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:35:14
I wish I could do that but I know I would check all the time even when I'm out.  I'm already down a ton of btc after fucking around in alts which makes me upset.  Still up way more than i imagined in USD value but it's the missed opportunity that always seems to hurt me more.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:29:48
I don't get it.  Does Andreas not have significant bitcoin holdings for some reason?  I just assumed he held a lot all these years.  I never saw the full story on why Roger said that.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:20:57
Honestly though, if you are in the US (and some other places) you better think about taxes.  The IRS is already getting 14k names from coinbase and I anticipate this might grow in the future.  Not a lot of people understand this but I'll give you an example...
Lets say you were holding 10 btc for longer than a year and you initially bought in at $1000 per btc ($10,000 initial investment).  You sold it all and received $175k.  $165k of that is realized profit and is taxed as long term capital gains.  It depends on your tax bracket but lets say you owe 20% capital gains.  You now owe the government $33,000  ($165k x 20%).  Meaning you would only have bought back in with $142,000 if you wanted to pay taxes with your profits.  Well if you did do that, then you just lost bitcoin because you can only afford 9.281 bitcoins with the money you have left over after taxes at a price of $15.3k thus giving you a net loss of 0.719 BTC.
Edited for 20% compared to 25%.  I think 20% is the max rate for long term capital gains.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:17:53
If it went the other way he could have lost his house.  Far more risk than anyone should take I think.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:07:34
Yeah you're right. I have more in-depth thinking to do.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:10:35
Is it literally just a btc bashing sub now?  I thought it initially split because theymos was running like a dictator?  I haven't been keeping up.
That being said, I can see where the frustration is coming from with bitcoin.  Network is slow...fees are too high.  Not sure how long it will take for lightening network to take off but a lot of OG bitcoin people are upset with the current situation.  I don't think a bitcoin fork is the future but I get where the frustration is coming from.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:47:00
People don't care though.  Unfortunately, most people in my world only care about making money.  Out of all my friends, only two have bought bitcoin - both of which never moved their coins out of GDAX/Gemini and neither even know the first thing about sending bitcoin around. I have a hard time believing most people are starting to use their own wallets with all this new money coming in.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:11:40
No. I don't think anyone is making that argument though.  It's more about the underlying financials and methods people use to evaluate stocks. There are different parts of the capital structure that people can buy into (loans, bonds, equity, etc.).  Different risk profiles and rights in the event of a bankruptcy.  Stock holders get voting rights and sometimes dividends.  Bitcoin holders get nothing.  That's why tons of people make the comparison to tulips and beanie babies - there really is no underlying value in the traditional sense.  That being said, it's a completely new industry/technology which is why you can't valuate it in a traditional sense.  That's kind of what the article is getting at though.  Comparisons to marketcaps of companies and bitcoin don't make much sense.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:01:33
That's true.  Definitely need to take a long trip after.  I'm more concerned with tax stuff right now.  I'm reaching out to a few tax advisers.
I've hit mid 6 figures.  I never really had a number in mind to be honest.  Only stipulation I put on myself was when I bought in Nov 2013, I said I had to hold for 5 years before i took out any money.  I also have a good enough job where I can lose all my btc and still be fine in life.
But yes, you're right.  I know this stress is terrible for my health.  I basically had this goal in my head of being able to retire young.  I don't even know what that number would be at this point though.  I've got some thinking to do.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:53:19
Its from this article: 
It's just a chart essentially saying bitcoin's market cap is similar to those banks but it doesn't have any assets (hinting that it has no value).  To be fair, the article does go on to explain why it's stupid to compare bitcoin and marketcaps of companies.

I see.  That's a tough one.  I'm sure someone out there could figure it out.  Even a temporary drop might be valuable in the long run.
Again - not trying to be mean.  Just my observations:
Hard to put my finger on but it kind of reminds me of a scam website.  It's hard to navigate and read.  Just makes it look unprofessional.
My other big problem is I added something to my cart and went to a different section of the site.  I couldn't figure out how to get to my cart and checkout so I just gave up.  That was my biggest problem with the site.  I should be able to get to my cart from any page on your site.
And also (correct me if I'm wrong) - I have to email you to get a bitcoin address in order to make a payment?  I can't just checkout through your booking system?  That's too much work on my end.
Everything is just too hard to figure out for me.  It should be easy to pick a product, see the price, bounce around on the website a bit and then checkout smoothly once I'm done.
Ever consider selling the business?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:04:12
I do need to figure that out.  Problem is, i don't know if it ever will feel like the right time.  I'm thinking back to the beginning of the year and in 2016 when i basically doubled and tripled my investment, I thought I would get out then.  Then everything rose so fast in March and I was way up and thought I could really turn this into something even more significant.
I don't spend money on shiny things for the most part. I've only spend significant money on a few electronics and trips.  Only thing on my mind is real estate for the future.

You're simplifying things way too much is my point. Goldman didn't single-handedly cause the economic crisis.  Many cogs in the wheel friend.
@_date: 2015-12-03 22:04:41
Ok guy.  Not complicating anything.  CDS and AAA ratings are not as simple as you may think.
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:51:47
Why are you just going around posting shit about Goldman?  You don't even know what you're talking about. 
For starters, Goldman didn't grade their own securities AAA.  Blame the ratings agencies (i.e. Moodys and S&amp;P).
Secondly, betting against those loans (I'm assuming you are referring to credit default swaps) is fairly common in the financial industry for hedging.  It's essentially insurance.  It's similar to buying insurance on your laptop.  You don't buy a laptop and get insurance assuming it's going to blow up.  You buy it to protect your purchase.

You're right.  Things are getting stolen left and right and there are basically no repercussions in the bitcoin world.  The best people can do is track addresses with no identities attached.

Wait, they don't even mention the word insolvency in the entire post.  What is going on?
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:20:49
Yeah but the volume is way down.  Under 5k coins and the last trade was 2 hours ago according to the chart. This is the slowest I've ever seen it.  I think people are holding their positions until more definitive news comes out.  I have some real btcs on there now just in case (stupidly small chance) Gox gives positive news. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:13:30
Serious questions...even if the coins were stolen, everyone basically knows who they belong to.  How are criminals going to exchange it into fiat without being caught?  If there is a police report filed, those addresses will be blacklisted essentially, right?  Or are these addresses not 100% confirmed to be Satoshi's?
Maybe I'm just not a good enough criminal.  On its face, it seems like he is now vulnerable but thinking a few steps ahead, it doesn't seem likely that criminals could get away with it.

Something about moving coins from one wallet to another.  I can't find the thread but I'm sure you can search for it.  He moved something like 424,242.424242 (something with 42's involved).

@_date: 2014-02-19 03:03:30

I was using it as a possible example of how terrible bitcoins could be seen as a store of value.  I have never used gox.

Bank statement with said money coming from Gox?  Blur out whatever private info is on there. Show the date, the amount and the sender.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:37:15
Incorrect.  That does not fit the definition of ["Store of value"](  It's about the "relative stability."  Bitcoins are pretty far from relatively stable.
Look, I'm a fan of bitcoins and I own them.  But the fact remains, at this current time, bitcoins are not a good store of value in the true defition of "store of value."
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:50:53
"As long as a currency is relatively stable in its value, money (such as a dollar bill) is the most common and efficient store of value found in an economy. "
Seriously?  You aren't even reading now.  It literally says "relatively stable" in the first few sentences.
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:37:46
First of all, the definition is literally two sentences.  One of the sentences has the "relatively stable" part.  How did you determine what the relavent portion of the definition is?
Secondly, you are completely missing the point.  It's a poor store of value currently because it is highly volatile.  End of story.  Sure it can be seen as a store of value but that doesn't make it a good one.  Anything can be a store of value if you want to look at it that way.  I can buy 1000 pencils today for a dollar each and they may be worth 5 cents each in 50 years.  Yes these pencils "stored" my value but it doesn't make pencils a GOOD store of value.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:11:43
No.  It's at .09.  You are missing a zero which makes a massive difference.  I think people are holding on to the fact that they may be able to recover some of their bitcoins eventually.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:44:59
Not anymore.  This is nuts.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:20:45
Again, that's fine.  When comparing the dollar and bitcoins though, the dollar is a better store of value because of its stability.  I am also using bitcoins as a store of value.  I see it more as an investment though.  I just don't think they can be viewed as a good store of value at this current point in time.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:26:35
I agree.  I don't see how it's possible to get back potentially stolen coins.  What if completely innocent people are now in control of these formerly stolen coins?  It's like if someone robs a bank and starts blowing through cash on bullshit, you can't go to each store and say "hey those were actually stolen dollars, we need to take them back"
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:29:45
I just don't think you understand the definition of store of value.  We are going to go in circles here.

@_date: 2014-03-06 16:41:14
I see what you're saying.  Won't people immediately raise the red flag when coins move from those addresses though, especially if they are known to be stolen?
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:44:13
Because accounts have to be verified for KYC/AML purposes.  That's like buying someones identity to an extent.  Only way is to buy goxcoins from bitcoinbuilder.com as far as I know.
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:53:40
You realize stability is in both directions?  The example you just gave is a great example for something that isn't stable.  You forgot to mention the volatility of bitcoins since they were created.  I can't argue with you anymore.  You fail to grasp the definition of stability and good stores of value.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:45:26
Haha come on dude. Are you messing with me?  In what way has bitcoin been relatively stable?  That's a big part of the definition.  That's like saying investing in an early stage startup is a good store of value because the value has gone up a little bit so therefore the value will definitely increase in the future.  No one knows what the future holds for bitcoins.  
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:33:17
I'm confused.  Then who sold all of those coins to drop the price so drastically if you are saying Gox was buying them?
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:06:31
I'm sure you could persuade almost anyone if you have a gun to their head.  I'd imagine people wouldn't just be breaking in to find a piece of paper with his private keys.

So let's say he 100% fucked up and lost the coins...why would he admit his guilt if that's the truth?  He's obviously still trying to salvage it so therefore he's going to keep his mouth shut.  Kind of like how lawyers advise people not to say a word when they get arrested no matter what.

@_date: 2014-02-18 19:02:23
So you clearly don't understand store of value...
I'm not saying you can't make money (I have made money) but the fact is that bitcoins, in their current state, are not a good store of value.  I'm strictly speaking about the standard defintion for store of value.

EDIT:  And I like the size of the Moto X - which might be big for iphone converts.  I didn't want a big tablet type of phone.  The iPhones are closer in size to the Moto X than the nexus
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:32:39
Bitcoin did lose it's value though.  It all depends on when someone bought in.  If I bought into GOX at it's height of around $1200, and I happened to get stuck in GOX now ($250ish) I would have lost 80% of my value.  That's not exactly a "store of value" in my book.
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:35:30
Haha again....store of value has nothing to do with value skyrocketing.  I think bitcoins will go up in value.  I have plenty of my own money in bitcoins.  That being said, it's not a good store of value when the price is so volatile.

Well 6 billion yen is around $60 million USD so basically they are saying their liabilities outweigh their assets by $30 million USD.  This clearly doesn't include the 850,000 missing bitcoins because that would bring liabilities closer to 50 billion Yen.  I wouldn't count on assets returned including bitcoins at all at this point in time because they clearly aren't included in their totals.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:24:13
I think that's a solid comparison.  I would probably trade with them if they restore all the funds and replace the entire team.
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:15:35
So we are just disagreeing on the definition of "store of value."  The dollar is predictable whereas bitcoins are not currently.  Do I think bitcoins can become a great "store of value" eventually...absolutely.  You are talking about the dollar over 100 years. The fact is, the dollar will have roughly the same buying power today as it does in a month.  You can't say the same for bitcoins right now.  Look at how predictable bitcoins have been over the past few months.  
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:53:29
That's fine but that has nothing to do with "store of value" from a financial point of view.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:30:58
I have no idea what to make of this.  Can someone please elaborate?
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:51:12
Nope.  Nothing that is 100% confirmed yet.  It's all speculation.  That being said, it doesn't look good at all...especially since Gox has been completely silent.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:27:38
Ok how about if I bought my bitcoins on coinbase on december 4th for $1116.  As of today they are worth $625.  Same idea.  I basically lost half of my value in 3 months.  Not a good store of value.

"Definitely won't get you in." Disagree.  I know a lot of traders and ibankers at Goldman and almost every single one didn't have a technical degree (e.g. econ, government, math).  Most of these people didn't even have perfect grades.  All went to some of the best schools though which is exactly where they recruit from.  So almost any degree can get you in if you go to a good school.

I see what you mean.  That's probably true that most of it hasn't been spent.  Then again, if it was a network of people and they have been pulling this off for a few years, it could be extremely difficult to piece it all together.  I suppose there could be a giant clawback effort like with the Madoff case...but that was also dealing with billions of dollars and many high net worth individuals who were willing to pay for lawyers fees and stick it out.  The Madoff clawback has been going on for 5 years now (still going on).

I don't think that's the best analogy.  Let's be honest, it was hard to find legal items on SR.  It's not like SR was selling a majority of legal items.  It was mostly illegal with a sprinkling of legal stuff whereas Ebay is entirely legal with anything illegal being camouflaged as something legal.
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:48:49
I know for a fact it did with at least 50 people who still work at Goldman or have worked at Goldman.  A degree from a good school with solid grades will get you a job there.  Ivy league schools are basically feeders into Goldman.  They take people with all different backgrounds.  In fact, I personally don't know one person with a technical degree that works at Goldman.
My brother used to work at GSAM and graduated from penn state with a degree in finance and an MBA from columbia.  
Some traders I know have non-tech backgrounds from schools including U of Richmond, Cornell, BC, Harvard, UPenn.  
I probably know the most people in ibanking (I went to Harvard for full disclosure) and they almost all had degrees in economics.
A degree from a good school with solid grades is probably the biggest factor that got them in.

I'm not doubting that there are tons of people that work at Goldman internationally with technical degrees.  I know a high percentage of people I went to school with or people that went to a similar high caliber school that work at Goldman and zero of them have a technical degree.  I was addressing your points on how getting a degree in finance is a poor way to get into a top investment bank and you also saying that any degree by itself "definitely" won't get you in.  That's blatantly wrong.
My whole point is that there is more weight on your pedigree than if you have a technical background.  Obviously it depends on what your specific job is.  You won't find a programmer with an econ degree working at Goldman most likely.  But you can definitely get into a large ibank without a technical background.  Your made up stat about how "95% of the people they employ are technical people" is also wildly incorrect.  I would estimate it's closer to 20%, if that.
If you are coming out of an ivy league school with solid grades and an econ/finance degree, you have a very good chance of getting a job at a BB firm.  That's just a fact.
EDIT:  That being said,  I'm sure if you were some technical genius from a non-prestigious school, you could definitely get a job at Goldman in the right area if you have experience to back it up.

Almost everything that came out is speculation.  The only confirmed facts are that Mt. Gox stopped withdrawals completely.  Then they shut down trading completely.  Then they removed their website essentially.  Now they have a statement that says they are monitoring and will react accordingly (whatever the fuck that means).  As far as I can tell, those are the only 100% true facts.

The internet isn't real life. I can't use the internet when i go to a restaurant or convenience store to pick up toilet paper and other bullshit.  I use the internet for almost every purchase but there are just some things you can't use it for practically.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:44:43
Where are you that it's practical to use bitcoin?  I don't have the option to be paid in bitcoin and I don't know where i can spend my BTC in real life.  I live in NYC.  Sure it's probably possible and sure i've bought stuff on the internet using bitcoin but I would not argue it's practical.  I remember back in 2013 everyone was getting rock hard over the fact that more and more merchants were adopting bitcoin payments.  How did that pan out?  I don't see very many of them accepting in NYC.  Not much has changed in the 4 years i've been around unfortunately.  It could just be a US things though.  It would be a pain in the ass to live off bitcoin honestly.

Honest question, when is this supposed to happen?  BTC is fucking painful to use right now compared to every other crypto.  Other coins send in like a minute.  BTC takes the longest by far.  I'm tired of reading about segwit and all this noise.  When does it go into practice?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:55:48
Thanks that is helpful.  Does segwit have anything to do with the speed or is that where a second layer on top of bitcoin comes in?

Yeah come on.  This is an easy one.  No one is buying drugs or laundering money with FarmBucks or whatever the fuck they are.  This is a dumb argument
Do people not understand the point of KYC/AML?  Know-Your-Customer/Anti-Money Laundering.  Show me examples of people laundering money or doing shady shit with Farmbucks and maybe you will have an argument.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:48:33
Stop trying to convince people to buy.  It's not your responsibility.  You just make crypto seem like a scam for the most part.  People will buy if they want to buy.  They don't need fanatics pretending like they can see the future in order to buy in.
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:20:02
KYC/AML is part of my job so I know a lot about it.  It's hard to get into all the intricacies but if you had to battle through the KYC/AML process with our counterparties, you would start to understand how it works.  Just for our funds to make simple investments, we have to go through a back and forth with counterparties to clear our funds and it can take several weeks to clear a fund.  They know the sources of the money and the head people involved.  
It's not designed to be a tool for police.  It's a deterrent for the true money launderers.  If I have to give you every piece of information about my life while i'm trying to launder money, do you think I'm going to do that?  It's designed so that every company doing business with one another does their part to battle shady characters.  If my company and another company want to make a co-investment into another company, every company needs to do KYC/AML checks on each other.  The system is designed to have people scrutinizing other people at all times to combat bad actors trying to squeeze through the system.
I'm not trying to get into the philosophical arguments for or against KYC/AML.  It exists for a reason and you may like that reason or not.  As with any program, there will be bad actors and things that fall through the cracks.  Is your argument to completely abolish KYC/AML?  All I was saying was that FarmVille and bitcoin are apples and oranges.

Thanks.  I'm not that worried.  I only invested $35k total over the past 4 years so I can't be upset with close to 1000% return.  I would have had to perfectly time the alt boom followed by the btc boom when btc was trending down in dominance.  Hindsight makes it seem obvious but it was hard to predict at the time, especially when alts made me rich.  I'm up like 150% in BTC value since February so I haven't done too badly.

Everyone throws out Polkadot but no one seems to talk about Blocknet for cross-chain stuff.  It's already got a functioning DEX as a proof of concept. I think more people need to look into it.  It's ahead of the competition and its been in development since 2014.  It just didn't have a big fancy ICO like every other coin out there.
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:33:09

I think it's good because it's a return to a normal functioning exchange meaning that people will not be afraid to put money into crypto if they have the ability to now take it out.  Kind of counter-intuitive but it's essentially a fix for a broken exchange which can be seen as a positive sign for the overall market.

Ok I had the same question as OP.  I'm currently looking at btc-e and bitstamp.  Bitstamp right now is around $50 and btc-e is around $82.  What's from stopping people from just buying off bitstamp and selling on btc-e?  Is is basically just the waiting period that throws this plan off?  Just trying to understand this.  That is an enormous difference between the two exchanges and I feel like it just can't be that easy for arbitrage.
EDIT: Well a few minutes after this post.  btc-e is now at 72 and bitstamp is at 62.  That narrowed quickly.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:28:48
I agree with this approach.  I tried reading the white paper early on and I was lost quickly.  I went to coinbase and started buying them and transferring them around to different wallets and different wallet services.  It's easier to get the basics down when you jump in and use them a little.  I plan on going back and digging into the deeper areas of bitcoin eventually.
