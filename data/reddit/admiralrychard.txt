If your password is that complex, it probably *looks* like a hash when stored in cleartext, at least.  (So you've got that going for you, which is nice.)

Yea, but they wouldn't know your email address unless it was *already* compromised, which is kind of the point.
That's *exactly* how hashes work.

If you were a true billionaire you'd build a fort out of money stacks and live in that.

Pretty sure there's a jQuery library for that.

Wait, can I get in on some of this?

Unsure what having a degree has to do with anything.

I think this is a great example.

It isn't "mined like gold" at all.
Also, there is a finite amount of gold on the planet, but we do not know what that amount is.  This is not the same as Bitcoin, where there is a finite amount, but importantly: we know exactly how many there are.

While this seems to undermine the whole benefit of bitcoin (centralizing), I do think that this type of system would be beneficial to your "average joe".  
It could also co-exist relatively peacefully within the system with the rest of us who don't necessarily want to put the safety of our coins in the hands of others.

I'm quite tired of all the in-fighting myself.
Despite being incredibly interesting by merit of the underlying technology (and of course, the math), people sure do spend a lot of time and energy talking about everything *but* that.
I just feel so drained trying to keep up with all the politics.  I see threads with the names of the same few people over and over; I don't know who they are, and quite frankly I don't care.  
People will come and go, but the *spirit* of Bitcoin is something that has the potential to outlive all of us.

I would wager to say that the vast majority of people holding Bitcoin aren't even aware of the whitepaper's existence.
Then again, I'm not entirely sure it matters to the average person.

Formatting a drive overwrites the area of the drive that maintains what is essentially the "table of contents" of the files on it.  This is why even after reformatting a drive, data can sometimes still be recovered from it.  The actual "data" isn't erased by the formatting process, but the location of that data is no longer known.  It's akin to forgetting where you've left something.  The reason why the drive appears blank after a format is that any location on the drive that doesn't have a record in the "table of contents" pointing at it is assumed to be blank data, and for all intents and purposes it is.
The "Windows.Old" folder doesn't exist if you've reformatted your drive.  This folder is only created if you've performed an "upgrade" on your windows installation, rather than a clean install.
Here's some more information I pulled off the internet for you:

Wait, do other smartphone platforms still not have this?
I have a bit of tunnel-vision, as a WP7 device (Samsung Focus) was my first smart phone. I just assumed this feature was common among the smartphone platforms considering how much utility I get out of it.

Newegg is likely reluctant to rely on a comparatively new payment processor such as Bitpay.  Newegg has a lot of customers and while they're probably reviewing the possibility of doing something like this, they're not very likely to jump on this bandwagon without first devising an implementation plan.  This is forgoing that Bitpay imposes daily transaction limits, so Newegg would have to come to some agreement with Bitpay in order to prevent.  (Lost sales due to a transaction limit?  It's extremely unlikely that Newegg would ever agree to something like that.) 
Newegg isn't a one-man e-commerce shop; it's a large company that can't afford to "leap without looking".
I'm confident that it will come.  When it does arrive, however, it will be a polished offering that will have very few issues on launch day.

The [thumbnail image]( you guys are using for Best Buy implies that the card is worth $100, but upon closer inspection this is not the case.
Just for the sake of clarity, you might want to modify that image to remove the value amount, lest you anger any potential customers.

The network as a whole; the majority of users (Read: miners) must agree to something for it to be the case.  It's completely decentralized.
