I think there are way too many exchanges throughout the world for any real coordinated shorting of bitcoin to last. Hell, look at what South Korea's been doing to our volume lately - they're going nuts for this stuff. If the investment class ever tried to push down the price, some random place in the world will jump to prop it right back up.
And as long as there's a decay in the faith of American leadership (which affects the dollar), political instability in parts of the world (hello, Venezuela and Zimbabwe!), etc. I think people will continue to flock to bitcoin for a high growth store of value. IMHO.

Just because I love and support my Seahawks as a native Seattleite and proud member of the 12th Man does not mean that the Broncos and their fans suck. Yet I love how the NFL *targets me* when I'm in Seattle, with all of the Seahawks paraphernalia, advertising, and marketing. The League met me on comfortable ground: home. Over the years, it has made me more interested in football in general and now, voila, I have bought DirecTV's Sunday Ticket for the last three years. Everybody wins.

Well that's some pretty circular logic there. So you're saying that it's okay for bitcoin only to appeal to people who already know what it is? That's a *great* attitude for growth right there.
You *are* going to convince people of its value if you make the effort to reach out to them. That includes gender-based marketing, race-based marketing, culturally based marketing. The fact that you willfully ignore the importance of looking beyond our current bitcoin circlejerk, which is heavily white and male, will continue to hinder its broader adoption. 
Just like the link I made in my post about the woman who felt harassed and condescended to at the bitcoin meetup because she was a woman is how I would've felt were I a person of color who was new to bitcoin and just read your comments in this thread. Let's marginalize me from the beginning because I don't know about bitcoin already and I'm not part of the clique it already caters to? Come on, "bro".

You obviously didn't read my post, nor visit the site. 
It's a fact that more bitcoin aware people tend to be white and male. I made a site called Blacks In Bitcoin because I am BLACK and I am in BITCOIN - and I don't see or hear nearly enough about or from people like me who are the same. My acknowledging this and reaching out to get more people of all backgrounds into bitcoin only helps spur adoption, by showing that it's not just white men deeply involved in bitcoin. Your comment just shows EXACTLY why this site is needed.
And thanks in advance for your support!

's response at the end was perfect: "If someone's selling bitcoin at $102, please tweet me  
While likely to be overlooked at the end of contentious segment, a simple statement like that on MSM proves bitcoin's "intrinsic" value. It's worth what we say it's worth and a helluva lot of us would be eager to snap up bitcoin at that price...or even today's (longterm) undervalued price.

Doubt I'll make it over to Zerocoin (don't know much about it) but I will mention how less vulnerable bitcoin is to the type of hacking Target and Neiman Marcus received.

EXACTLY. Which is why speaking directly to people of color will get them more interested in it. People tend to respond to ideas presented to them by people like them. If it helps get even one more person interested in bitcoin due to the fact that I'm black, all the better. 
I do find it laughable, though, that people can still read my post and think I'm "segregating" bitcoin. Once again, I ask the question: Since when did acknowledging culture become segregation? 
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:58:20
Most of these "well funded" bitcoin companies are, appropriately, putting their funds into startup costs, many of which are more concerned with establishing proof of concept over marketing at the moment. One of the many lessons VCs learned from Web 1.0 failures was not to overinvest in marketing before having a solid product first (i.e. pets.com). It's no coincidence it's taken almost a decade for the first YouTube commercials to hit the air this year. 
If we wait on these new bitcoin companies to advertise for us, we might be waiting a while.

I respectfully disagree. I've worked in some form or other in marketing most of my adult life and one thing has always rung true: You can't sell a secret. Time and time again, we've seen inferior products succeed due to solid marketing and/or on the strength of marketing muscle, from VHS trumping Betamax to any big blockbuster summer movie destroying elegantly made, smartly written Oscar-winning ones at the box office. 
While like you, I wouldn't/couldn't help pay for a bitcoin ad at the moment, I do see its utility and necessity in getting the word out.

In the financial community, this is often laughed at, er, referred to as ["moral hazard."]( That if there aren't sufficient consequences for their risky actions, i.e. constantly getting bailed out for bad decision-making and bad bets, they run the moral hazard of doing it with impunity - like they do now.

I remember when someone posted a thought here that bitcoin should buy a SuperBowl ad. He was effectively clowned out of his own thread. I always thought something like that was a good idea: Using analog (mainstream) methods to promote our digital cryptocurrency. Yet the general feel seemed to be that we shouldn't deign to reach the masses where they are. Just the amount of conversation that this altcoin is generating due to it hitting Joe Sixpack in the eyeballs on the Left Turn Only Circuit seems like something bitcoin should've - and still could've - done.

I'm not insinuating anything: I'm outright saying that it's been my experience, as a black man in America, that we *haven't* been "getting" how awesome bitcoin is, possibly because no one has made it a priority like I have to address us directly. 
I'm a marketing guy and I can promise you that messaging is more effective when it's *targeted*. It's ignorance - and arrogance - to think that a one-size-fits-all approach to bitcoin is the *only* approach needed to draw in everyone to bitcoin. I think that via micro-marketing in several different demographic cohorts - whether it be by age, race, country, gender, etc. - can only *help* bitcoin's greater adoption. 
It astounds me that people get still get so hung up on race and fail to see that this is Marketing 101. And everything in life, to a degree, is marketing. Can't sell a secret. We need everyone to "buy" into bitcoin.

I don't know. Do you have to declare your ATM card as an "instrument equal to $10K" if you have that much in your bank account? Your smartphone connected to your online bank savings account? Where do we draw the line with this? 
Having a bitcoin wallet, kept in cold storage on a thumb drive or an internet disconnected laptop should be considered the same as having a credit card, ATM debit card, or checkbook with secondary access to your $10K+ horde of cash, IMO. Digital cash isn't exactly the same as hiding cash like [this poor girl]( did, is it?

Must be nice to be able to leave race out of stuff whenever you want. You continue to live in that world; I'll live in the real one. 
The faster we get ALL cultures and backgrounds involved in bitcoin, the faster the adoption. Like it or not, examples and modeling help inform and interest people in areas they may never have thought much about, like how pop culture helped ease Americans into the idea of a black president (24, DEEP IMPACT, etc.) and gay marriage (WILL AND GRACE, MODERN FAMILY, etc.). It may not be your "irrelevant" experience but when I am around people of color, more likely than not, they have not heard of bitcoin. My site is a resource for everyone, but particularly people of color, to become interested in bitcoin. That I look like them - and cater to them - is HIGHLY relevant. 
Acknowledging race and culture does nothing to tarnish bitcoin and does everything to acknowledge reality. I'll be happy to leave ignorance out of cryptocurrencies, though. By the way, I LOVE being told that my being black is "irrelevant". I have a lifetime of experience living in America that indicates otherwise. You have a nice day.

I tell this to anyone who will listen. Although my first bitcoin trade ever was on Mt. Gox almost a year ago, I haven't fucked with them since. Anyone who messed with Gox once they started restricting USD withdrawals last summer was playing with fire; at that point, especially with their huge spread over other exchanges, I stopped taking them seriously as a safe, viable exchange. Like Erik Voorhees shrugged off in an interview, he knew the risk he was taking keeping bitcoin on that dubious exchange and won't cry about the loss.

This needs more love, IMO. I live in Vegas and, despite being a quiet tech and bitcoin hotbed, it astonishes me that there aren't MORE bitcoin ATMs in casinos. But then you run into KYC/AML laws anyway that kinda ruin the experience. 
For example, at The D, the only casino I know of at the moment in Vegas that has a [bitcoin ATM ON the casino floor]( After three palm scans and submitting your cell phone number to be "approved" for a Robocoin account, only then can you use the machine. And then I believe you're limited to $3000 a day (or per deposit? I'm not sure about this) at the machine.

One should only feel "insulted" or "derided" if trotting out the same tired, false cliches about diversity applies to them. The rational thing to do would be to eliminate such red herring time-wasters from the start. Looks like my post is off to a good start!
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:26:12
In my interview with the article's author, Kyle Coward, he mentioned that very same thing. And it might be generational, when you consider the history of banking against African-Americans (redlining, predatory lending, inability to get loans, etc. just to name stuff AFTER Jim Crow). There might be inherent distrust by older black people of any external banking factors that they cannot control. 
But, FWIW, my 72 year old mother LOVES bitcoin, once I properly explained it to her. But she's a perfect example of using targeted outreach to bring someone outside the early adopter demo into the bitcoin community. She's black and old and has never used Reddit.
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:23:46
Oh, and to cut off a familiar, equally tired, trope of the "colorblind" crowd before it gets started: Wanting to reach out to specific, diverse communities isn't exclusionary by practice or intent - it's just good marketing. Targeting your message and/or expanding said message's reach to those outside any dominant community does not have to (and usually doesn't) exclude or lessen the dominant community. Reaching for black folk or more women in bitcoin doesn't lessen the overwhelming impact of the community's white male early adopters on the community, nor should they be threatened otherwise. Bitcoin is for everybody and concerted efforts should be made to reach everybody. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:16:37
I'm featured in the article and the creator of BlacksInBitcoin.com. Generally, I find the American dominant culture's attempt to shrug off race in its attempt to embrace "colorblindness" or "equality" as lazy and, at best, naive. Acknowledging race, or racial differences, in anything doesn't make you any more racist or racial, it's just recognizing reality; like noticing the difference between a blonde or a brunette, and their potential impact on society (do blondes REALLY have more fun??) And the reality in bitcoin culture so far is that there's a lack of widespread participation from African-Americans. While I am one and have a small sample size in my dealings with people, I very much find this to be true. This article dares to ask why and does so in a fairly noncontroversial, straightforward manner. 
I look forward to the plethora of downvotes and sarcastic, self-righteous idealism from people younger than me, whiter than me, trying to tell me how the world "really" works for them. For everyone else who, like me, accepts bitcoin's community-agnostic platform and sees the value in actively reaching out to other communities outside its early adopters, I look even more forward to your response.

Might as well go for it. With the CME Futures coming online 2nd week of December, we about to see an influx of that sweet, sweet, ironic institutional fiat buying up bitcoin. I talked to an investment banker from Wells Fargo today and even though they won't take positions as an institution yet, all his peers are very buzzy about bitcoin and crypto. Giving it a more traditionally used vehicle of the CME should lend BTC more mainstream legitimacy/adoption. IMHO.

What's making bitcoin a bit more resistant this time is the huge involvement of the Chinese, with China being a nation of savers, and more widely traded exchanges than just Mt. Gox, that are propping up the price. I don't know about you but I'm waking up every morning the past few weeks to see BTCChina having pushed the price up 5-15% overnight.

Sorry you feel that way, workahaulic. Infiniti Poker was designed for both the tech savvy (bitcoiner) and the casual (recreational) player. We've always maintained that bitcoin would be a cashier option and not *the only* cashier option for the site. We would rather not discriminate against our ROW players who wish to deposit and withdraw via credit card, Skrill, etc. Making USD the site currency facilitates this much easier; you are always welcome to withdraw via BTC.

You're right: The reason for the slowish adoption of bitcoin is because the majority doesn't think that deeply about stuff. Until the Recession took my house and car and I had to move back home into my childhood room, I didn't think deeply about that stuff either. Most people are too busy working their tails off for a devalued dollar and/or just trying to get by with real wage standards that haven't been effectively raised since the 1960s. But once I started reading during my 18-month society sabbatical about the causes of the Recession, how a lot of these macroeconomic forces are rigged, er, set up (I admit, with an MBA, I was already pre-disposed some to the subject matter), I came to see how inherently unfair and, dare, I say it, anti-free market the global economy truly is.
Enter, bitcoin. I got on the train late (March), but I'm glad I got on. For all those people working 40+ hour weeks trying to support families, etc., they tend to not have the free headspace to absorb this radical change to everything they know. Once we keep paving the way, building up economic infrastructure, and making it dead simple to acquire it and spend it, they'll come along. Especially when economic forces keep systematically screwing over the least advantaged in the system. Just ask Argentina, Cyprus, Greece, Next Failing Economic State...

One addendum to explanation: Merchants *can* use bitcoin effectively as a unit of account, as Coinbase and Bitpay will exchange bitcoin into whatever currency they want immediately, so there's no risk of value loss. So if pizzaforbitcoins wanted $31 USD for sending you two pizzas instead of a possible $28 a half hour later, if they were using Bitpay, they'd get their bitcoin exchanged at point of sale for $31 USD.

Excellent question. 
1. We built our software from scratch over the last three years to create an enjoyable yet professional atmosphere. Graphically, I believe we have a very elegant product.
2. Incentives are coming. We plan to offer your choice of a first deposit bonus, 50% lifetime free rake, or an instant credit to your account. These will be available to all shortly and everyone will be eligible to take advantage of selecting one of the three options one time only.
3. We are US facing but also a citizen of the *world*. Players from around the globe will have several deposit and withdrawal options in addition to bitcoin, which will attract even more casual players than the technological diehards who understand and are comfortable with bitcoin.
4. We will have a variety of guaranteed tournaments, SNGs, and MTT-SNGs once we add tournaments to the site.
5. Our [Prestige Club]( rewards program has been specially designed to reward handsomely not only high-volume grinders but also recreational players as well.
6. In the near future we will enable our Infinivision webcam poker platform for real money play. Currently, it is available for play money during our soft launch.
7. Look forward to Infiniti Poker sponsored pro Gavin Smith to be mixing it up at the tables. He's a lot of fun and talks shit in the chatbox to *anyone*.
8. We're new. We're in love with poker (hell, *I'm* in love with poker). I'm a player myself and a sponsored pro. We have every incentive to get this right for the poker community. And as an American, I want to be able to play online against my friends in the UK and Mexico when I go visit my friends in Atlanta, and not be stuck with a handful of ringfenced states with tiny player pools.
Hope this helps and looking forward to seeing you on the tables!

What hedges against too drastic a "crash" this time is the deep involvement by China (a nation of savers) and more heavily traded, viable exchanges other than Mt. Gox to defray the panic.

The article likened Ripple Labs' owning half of xrps as to the government, and its capital controls on use of money, like that's a *good* thing. Yes, we know it's the norm, but that's not necessarily not-evil. 
When one company/entity owns more than half (and it will be more than half until they finish giving away the other half of xrp they say they will), we're back where we started, lending far too much power over what we value to someone else. The beauty of bitcoin is that the decentralized nature of it allows us to see one of the few genuinely free, large-scale markets grow in real time. If I wanted to give more power to an institution over my money, I wouldn't have gotten into crypto-currencies in the first place.

I feel your pain, lol. As a player myself, I remember Black Friday all too well.
No one can predict with utmost certainty the political machinations of any one government but, so far, the US seems to be on board. Even if they aren't, China's not messing around and going big on bitcoin at the moment. And for every country that may try and hate on bitcoin, there are two others that embrace it.
Also, there's technological FOMO going on. I was a little surprised to hear how concerned senators were with chasing innovation and business overseas (didn't stop them from trying to kill online poker, did it?). When it comes to something as potentially transformative as bitcoin, just like with the Internet, they'll be cautious but veer more towards wanting to be on the right side of history when it explodes.
EDIT: And, to a greater extent like how there's still sites like Carbon, America's Cardroom, etc. still servicing the American poker market, if the US or any country tried to squelch bitcoin, it'll just drive it underground where it will still flourish anyway. It's like trying to stop cash. Can't stop cash.

UIGEA legislation is a series of banking restrictions designed to make it difficult to run an online poker business in the United States.

Gold is the traditional economist's religion: They believe in it because they have blind faith. Organized religion has been described as "mass delusion" because it consists largely of people putting their faith - re: *value* - in something for somewhat arbitrary, non-empirically proven reasons. And, quite honestly, outside of the laws of physical science, we all have to put our faith into other "things", like institutions, laws, etc., in order to get along in society which, by default, gives those things some sort of "intrinsic value." 
Gold's biggest claim to intrinsic value fame is that other people have made it their religion for thousands of years. That's it. If you can ever get one of those bitcoin-hating economists to admit that, their argument promptly falls apart.

Because bitcoin isn't the only deposit option (we've already received many deposits using other deposit methods), we feel our exposure to bitcoin is more than fine. Also, since player funds are segregated, the bitcoin deposited will still be in bitcoin, less rake taken out each day. If we have more requests for bitcoin than bitcoin on hand, we will buy the necessary bitcoin to cover the demand using the segregated fiat currency player fund account.

Well there's the rub: What *is* "actual value"? 
The US Dollar has value because we say it does; we continue to believe in it even though inflation and money printing continues to destroy its actual value. Being backed by "the full faith and credit of the United States" doesn't mean shit when we have a dysfunctional government with a central bank that's money printing its way into oblivion. 
Gold has value because people say it does; exactly how useful is gold on a daily basis? If you're not slapping together motherboards each day, filling teeth, or obsesses with shiny things like Smaug the dragon, then gold doesn't have much "intrinsic value" (that awful term economists love to sling around like it means something). 
My point is that value, like most things in life, is somewhat subjective. What's cool about bitcoin is that its value is directly determined peer-to-peer; it's value is whatever we say it is. So bitcoin is backed by the full faith and credit of those who believe in it as decentralized currency, store of value, and payment processing system. In other words, it's backed by people like *me*.

During the dotcom bubble, several companies introduced themselves to the world via a SuperBowl commercial. The first time I ever heard of GoDaddy was through a SuperBowl commercial. If we want bitcoin to achieve critical mass as a payment technology and store of value, it has to reach the digitally unreachable. A SuperBowl commercial can achieve that in one fell swoop with a good, albeit pricey, commercial.

1. Our decision to offer games to US players stems from the fact that there is no federal law that decrees online poker as an illegal activity. The UIGEA was created by the feds to basically, in an attempt to curb and eliminate players in the US from playing poker on offshore gambling sites, transfer the burden of capping the flow of online poker activity within the States over to the U.S. banks and creating the law which, in essence, made an illegal act of utilizing U.S. banks and credit card processors for transferring funds between players and online poker operators. Therefore, by only allowing US players to fund their activities through Bitcoin, neither the site nor the players would be in violation of UIGEA  - with the exception of those players who reside in individual states that have, in fact, implemented laws banning online poker. Infiniti Poker has engaged legal counsel in the U.S. that will be providing a legal opinion regarding our activities in the U.S. jurisdiction. In the end it will be up to the players who must educate themselves about the laws within the states in which they reside and to make their own  decisions about whether or not to participate in real money play at Infiniti based on their understanding about both federal and state laws which may affect them. 
2. Infiniti Poker fully appreciates player’s concerns regarding security and fairness as it pertains to their selection of online poker platform. This is why we utilize the “QUANTIS” Random Number Generator (RNG) cards from ID Quantique. These are the same cards that are utilized by the Swiss Lottery Corporation and are considered the leader in “high performance, multi-protocol network encryption based on conventional and quantum technologies”. Although these cards were significant in cost compared to less secure alternatives, this specific area of concern you raised is one that we anticipated from the majority of prospective Infiniti Poker Nation Loopers and thus, we felt it was a sound investment. Here is a link to the website of ID Quantique if you would like more specific information:  
3. We are open to the use of HUD software on the site. We would look into using it after full launch should the demand for it still be strong. We've reached out to PT and HEM but have yet to have them reach back. It's been brought to my attention recently about us possibly using something compatible with FPDB. I've downloaded it and will look into it this weekend as another possible software solution. Personally, I use and *love* HUDs as a learning tool and would greatly enjoy having them on Infiniti Poker.
4. Infiniti Poker's operations are conducted under a license granted within the jurisdiction of Costa Rica. As such, we will be largely self-regulated. We wanted to create a unique product that was proprietary, so we chose to reinvest more into the product. The reason we are in Costa Rica is for cost control, so we can focus our money on the quality of the end product. We anticipate moving shortly to a white label jurisdiction like Gibraltar or Malta. We chose quality of product over where it’s located.
4a. For now, we intend that 50% rakeback offer to stand. It will be a choice in a one-time offer for early adopters/sign-up promotion for new players once we have launched the promotion. The other two choices are a deposit bonus or a no-deposit instant account credit. You will have to acquire a fairly active level of PCPs (Prestige Club Points) over a year to maintain your 50% rakeback from year-to-year, but it's reasonably achievable. While more specifics will be provided once we start the promotion, it clocks in around 300K hands at 200NL over a 365 day period. 
4b. Right now we have tables available from 2NL to 2KNL. I've worked on rake charts up to 10KNL. I don't see why we wouldn't offer up to that once we have the traffic to accommodate those levels.
Anything else? Wait - don't answer that...

From what I can tell (haven't opened an account yet), with Coinbase, you can deposit/withdraw directly from your bank checking account to your Coinbase account to convert bitcoin, with next day payment. Someone let me know if I'm wrong about this.

If the whole point is to lower the psychological barrier to bitcoin adoption then *something* has to be done. I'm open to ideas. I'm tired of hearing perfectly smart people I know say "It costs too much" to get into bitcoin, no matter how much info I dump on them. Until it's widely accepted as a payment system, non-wealthy, non-financially informed people are going to look at bitcoin like they look at gold: too expensive without much day-to-day utility.

I love the discussion, Thorbinator, but I believe you're missing the point of our site. While personally I *love* bitcoin, this site was never created to be bitcoin-specific. We treat bitcoin like any other currency. If you're Canadian, deposit in CAD, and then withdraw when the CAD is considerably weaker than when you deposited, that's the currency risk you take. 
The use of bitcoin was always as a means to expedite the cashier function and the protocol's lovely payment processing system. To my knowledge, it was never meant to be the site's currency.

I think you're off. The largest sites of FTP and PokerStars (same thing) are trying to get back into the US market online gaming. I know for a fact that they won't do anything (else) to jeopardize their already expensive, highly-publicized legal situation with the United States after several years of being a "bad actor," even though bitcoin doesn't involve the traditional banking system. 
Most publicly traded sites like bwin/Party would probably avoid the hassle until there's overwhelming consistency of clarity in this area as well (having idiots like California government send cease &amp; desists to the likes of Bitcoin Foundation does NOT help). 
Legally, there's nothing stopping them, or any site, from supporting BTC as a cashier option and marketing to US players. That's what we plan to do at Infiniti Poker when we open for real money play later on this month.

Keep in mind this is a very young currency/instrument and the overall market cap/exposure of bitcoin is very small. You can't expect NYSE-level of trading with companies that are only 3 or 4 years old. Over time, when more and more money (particularly institutional investors and hedge fund types) get involved, you will see limits increase and, eventually, even disappear at these exchanges.

Fine, I'll bite. Reason I'm giving TheInsiderMan benefit of the doubt is because the people who've built Paypal up into the online payment behemoth it is and has been over the past decade, aren't stupid. Consider that Peter Thiel, one of the founders of Paypal, was part of a funding round that sunk $2M into Bitpay back in May. Assuming the slowly rising popularity of bitcoin, its inherent advantages, and its "business model" that threatens to undermine their own, and it makes sense why Paypal would want to get in on this. I'll just be glad that once they do, it'll basically be the largest single worldwide endorsement of bitcoin as a legitimate medium of exchange.

Outside of speculation, is litecoin actually being used transactionally in any significant volume? Am I missing something?
I'm not going to knock something I don't know much about (like CNBC does to bitcoin) but I don't get the utility to litecoin at the moment when bitcoin not only has been "first to market" in solidifying the idea of digital cash, but also has been rapidly building the social and commercial infrastructure around it.

This is why I adopt the following method:
For every 10% increase in price, sell 5% of your holdings. Pocket half, reinvest the other half into bitcoin. For every 20% in decline, sell 10%, pocket half, reinvest the other half. Wash, rinse, repeat. 
May not be the most scientific but it keeps you taking profit and mitigating risk while staying invested in bitcoin's long term success.

With the exception of a handful of states in the U.S., it is not illegal to play online poker. It *is* illegal for a company to use the U.S. banking system for transactions that directly facilitate online poker, except for in the regulated states of NV, NJ, and DE.

It's in early adopters' self-interest to spend *some* of their bitcoin success. Because if everyone hoards, the price may increase some but won't reach its full potential if 1) it's too hard to get for newcomers and 2) the powerful other half to bitcoin, its payment processing technology, isn't utilized. If people aren't actually transacting bitcoin then the price/value of bitcoin will fall due to lack of real world utility.

We appreciate your concern, Thorbinator, but we are launching at a very serendipitous time for bitcoin. While currency fluctuations are a concern for any international company, we see bitcoin as having significant unrealized value. In the long term, that value is more likely to go up than down, especially as bitcoin [gains more and more institutional legitimacy and interest]( Once you mix in the large amount of fiat deposits from ROW players, we will be properly defended from exchange rate risk. With the rapid adoption an infrastructure being built around bitcoin, maybe we should afraid that the *US dollar* may plunge in value! ;)

Banks should support BTC because, for now, we still need access to fiat currency while the concept of a digital, cashless society really takes hold. But, more than likely, banks see bitcoin as an existential threat; once it gets big enough (i.e. tens of billions in market cap), they will go out of their way to kill it by lobbying it to death (if some haven't started already). 
That being said, in the United States and a few other territories with some ridiculously hypocritical, pseudo-morality based laws that impinge on personal freedom (Canada and Australia also spring to mind), banks generally want nothing to do with online gambling payment processing because of Da Law. They see it as far too much hassle for such a small percentage of their business. 
I told my friend at PokerStars months ago that they should look into bitcoin as a payment processing option. But with their tenuous attempt at the US market (still lucrative due to the high standard of living and disposable income) and stringent KYC (Know Your Client) and AML (anti-money laundering) concerns they self-impose and are imposed by them in many countries, I just have a hard time believing they'll be jumping into bitcoin anytime soon. MAYBE on their smaller, ringfenced sites like PokerStars.fr or somewhere, but I doubt we'll see it on the Mother Ship anytime soon.

That's what drives me nuts about outsiders' take on bitcoin: They assume it's a TOTALLY binary investment. Granted, it's only been around four years and change, but to assume based primarily on its volatility that it'll either go to $1M or $0 is ludicrous. Besides the infrastructure being built around it, there are too many people financially and emotionally invested in seeing it succeed for it to plunge to $0.

You have to believe that he took some profits along the way. But it's conceivable that he kept at least 5,000-10,000 bitcoin which would put him in the $6M - $12M USD (at current ~$1200 USDBTC price) range. 
The irony is 1BTC is almost equal to 1 oz. of gold ($1239 as of 11/27/13). So if his 60 oz of gold cost him ~$94,500 (he says in the post that bitcoin cost about $7 then) then that's some pretty sweet ROI.

How massive will it truly be, though? I expect it to be more of a gradual one, as "early adopters," say anyone active on this subreddit and investors who got in &lt; $1000 USD/BTC, would experience dramatic wealth over the next 5-10 years. But I suspect most people won't come around for another 18 months or so, when bitcoin is more widely adopted and the price appreciates steadily but not so drastically as it has this year. There will still be money to be made for the late adopters, but I think saturation of bitcoin's availability and popularity would flatten their gains in comparison to ours. IMO.

2. The world (and, most notably, China again) clamoring for a replacement of the US Dollar as the world's reserve currency. Because, you know, our country's government is really fucked up right now.
3. More heavily traded exchanges than before. Half of us aren't even using Mt. Gox as the barometer anymore: We're drooling over BTC China. That crazy exchange is sometimes as much as 30% higher than Gox and Bitstamp with even more volume. If one of these exchanges started to trip, the others would pick up the slack.
4. For all the early adopters/miners cashing out, there are just as many Wall Street money managers who've been waiting in the wings to swoop in and buy on the dips. Today's performance in the Senate was just the sort of guidance the financial sector was looking for.
5. Bitcoin practices that whole Fibonacci retracement thing very well. For every price adjustment (I refuse to call it a "correction" when we keep "correcting" upward) it's experienced recently, it's bottoming out point seems to be higher than before. 
6. Much more bitcoin infrastructure in place than before even just 6 months ago. I doubt VCs like Peter Thiel, Max Keiser, Union Square Ventures, et. al. would willy-nilly lead multimillion dollar funding rounds of some of bitcoin's more noticeable companies. (And yes, I know x out of 10 startups fail. That risk gets mitigated some with all the other reasons above).
7. For as much as the community initially clowned them, the Winklevoss ETF has been a great PR tool for the "wizards" of Wall Street, presenting a somewhat arbitrary vehicle as an entry point to bitcoin in terms they can understand. That billionaires with a lot on their plate won't take the time to learn how to create an offline paper wallet and willingly fork over 2-4% a year to the Twins for what they could do for free, is their problem, not ours.
TL;DR: Yes, there will be valleys to go with our peaks. But the environment is much more robust now for bitcoin's medium and long-term success than it ever has been.

This cannot be real.
I thought we flocked *to* bitcoin to escape such bank-like onerous fees and practices. Very disappointing, and a poor business model for anyone who can *read*.

Yes, your statement is more accurate. But as someone who likes a bit of certainty to my bitcoin at point of sale, it feels like knowledgeable buying has been suspended.

At Infiniti, we believe in giving people options for how they wish to transact in real money. Save the legalities concerning the US market, we wouldn't dream of limiting our players to just one form of payment processing. Different strokes for different folks...

U.S. law is weak in this area. The only illegal act is using the banking system to facilitate online poker; therefore, we're going to allow U.S. players to play. If we are ever in a position where we are at odds with the DOJ and they attempt to seize our operations facing the U.S., U.S. players, who are only allowed to bet with bitcoin, will never have their money seized. Part of the reason we are moving forward with a .com is to prove that we are doing nothing wrong and have nothing to hide. Having been burned myself by Full Tilt in the past, transparency is very important to us, hence my presence here on Reddit, answering your questions.

...And there's the dip. It'll be back up, tho. Might not even take it an hour.
And the bounceback.
Wait. As I just typed this, Bitcoinity went back over $1000. And dipped again. Where it stops, nobody knows...
@_date: 2013-06-06 16:58:34
Not exactly sure how to do that (super-newbie here). Just repost on that subreddit?
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:55:10
I'm pretty sure that if bitcoin and Coinbase are ultimately successful (say, widely adopted and recognized within the next 3-5 years), there's no way they let themselves get acquired, even with a Godfather/Snapchat-like offer (and I think Snapchat is CRAY for turning down $3B). There's so much more to be had once you're THE go-to service in bitcoin America, I know if I owned Coinbase, I wouldn't sell out. I'd eventually go public and CASH IN.

As I work for Infiniti Poker, a new poker site officially launching next month that has bitcoin as a cashier option, it's encouraging to see this kind of online gaming valuation in bitcoin. Very encouraging indeed.

Besides the Paypal CEO talking about how they were "looking closely" at bitcoin a few months ago, there was a new poster to reddit who claimed he worked at Paypal and knew specifically of their intention to integrate bitcoin into their system soon.

USD is the site currency. When depositing BTC, it's converted upon deposit into US dollars on the site. And when withdrawing US dollars from the site via bitcoin, it's converted into BTC.

Sigh. More shade. When will/what will it take for them to ever learn?

You deposit via our secure cashier using BTC, which is converted to USD, the site currency, upon its arrival (takes between 10-40 minutes for the deposit to register, depending upon the blockchain confirmations). All buy-in amounts are in USD.
We will keep the majority of the players' bitcoin funds in a segregated wallet - and in cold storage for the utmost security.
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:12:07
Rakeback will be credited to the site currency, which is USD. But yes, you can cashout in bitcoin. If you're in the US, the only methods of deposit and withdrawal *is* bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:06:48
TL;DR: Get to know bitcoin, give our site a shot, and we'll build you a home where it's safe to play poker with no fear.

Let's say 1 BTC = $1000 USD. You deposit 1 BTC on the site and are credited $1000 USD, which is the site currency. You win 10% over 12 hours and want to withdraw $1100. Meanwhile, 1 BTC now equals $2000. So now you'll only be withdrawing 0.55 BTC. Am *I* missing something here?

Actually Bitpay changed their pricing to a [flat monthly fee]( as on option. You could spend as little as $30 a month to take bitcoin. Think of the savings on THAT?!
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:19:58
The site's currency is USD and deposited BTC is instantly converted to dollars; therefore betting is done in USD. I believe we're pegged to the exchange rate blockchain.info uses.
After I knock out some more Reddit, I'll attend to your email.
And I *would* tip you some bitcoin, but you *won all of ours already!* Glad to see you back, Gldn.

1. We would love to add poker tracking software but have yet to feel the love back. *Why won't you call me back, HEM??* (sniffle, sniffle)
2. We go from 2NL to 2KNL for now. 
3. Our rake structure can be found on our [Prestige Club page](
4. During soft launch, we won't have any incentives at first. Once we go into full launch around the first of the year, we will offer your choice of a one-time deposit bonus, 50% lifetime rakeback, or an instant credit to your account.
Look no further: We're here for you, Kombaiya!

And because bitcoin is in limited, finite supply over time, this almost bakes in guaranteed appreciation in the future. What's great is that because it's divisible to the eighth decimal point, there will be more than enough for everyone but the price per bitcoin will still go up. Which is something we no longer see with fiat currency like the US Dollar, whose purchasing power decreases every year thanks to all the bond buying and money printing, decreasing in value like a car driven off the lot. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:22:41
Yeah, whenever the MSM haters come out, I just tweet them a link to a lifetime log chart. Charting bitcoin as its percentage of increase makes more sense (and looks better) than a straight price chart. But all the mainstream media cares about (for now) is the bright, simple, shiny object that is price. They're playing checkers, bitcoin's playing chess.
