They won't control the underlying system. We should be encouraging the integration of crypto into mainstream finance. Crypto doesnt have to be at war with banks, they can coexist and produce a better economy for all of us

Why are y'all acting like this is a bad thing? The people watching CNBC are the traditional investors with deep pockets who have historically shied away from bitcoin. More understanding and awareness is a net positive at this stage. There's still a massive education barrier we need to get over.

just dont panic sell. check it as little as possible. it will come back, don't you worry

these same people who swore off crypto for good are going to buy back in at the peak of the next craze and make the same mistake. You need to be a disciplined investor and buy when others are fearful to make money in this.

I just keep putting in a couple hundred bucks a month and dollar-cost averaging into the dip. Strategy isnt changing

Timing the market is a fool's game. Don't listen to anyone who claims to know when the bottom of this bear market. Rather than waiting for a set price then buying all of your bitcoin, I recommend staggering smaller purchases so that your average is closer to that of the bottom. I think now is a tremendous buying opportunity, whether you get in at 6300 or 5000 its not a world of difference in the long run. I'm expecting it to hit 100k in the next 5 years you won't be kicking yourself for not having perfect timing when that happens

if it reaches 1 million, the dollar will have crumbled in value and this won't be an issue

Jesus, can we discuss this without unnecessary escalation? 
Tokenization allows for fractional shares which means trading is accessible to just about everyone regardless of financial situation, this is what I mean by boosting liquidity

they had an MIT researcher to provide a pro-cryptocurrency argument! And she was great!
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:06:53
I completely disagree. 60 minutes seriously entertained the notion that crypto will completely upend society and we'll be laughing at the piece's ignorance in 20 years. That is lightyears ahead of the coverage we had in '17/'18
