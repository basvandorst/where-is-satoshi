I'm really hoping aug 1 scares some of the fish out of the water and we see some dumping, I'm buying little bits daily and heavier chunks when we see dips, which has worked well for me.

I've bought at 1600, and I've bought at 2600.  There's never a bad time to buy more.  Trade small portions of my coin on swings, which I use profits to buy larger portions so hold for long term when there's dips.

Checks out.

If anything it only makes us stronger, since less bullshit alt coins will be flooding the market.  HODL

Lol hey I bet you'll take it.  I wonder what the overlap on addressses is and how often it happens.  
At first I thought it was just a small market swing, then I realized I was looking in a wallet that I had transferred all funds out of...

Still sweeping...

I suggest to anyone looking for an entry point to crypto to look to this week.

Hopefully you've been dollar cost averaging.  I tossed an old laptop after getting a nice ass new Lenovo that had traces somewhere of probably 4-5 coins.  
Chalk it up to the game

Wow that's interesting.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I think their HQ is in SF...I bet a similar service from another county would be a little more open to using BTC.  I don't see why they couldn't do it though, but they may be worried about regulatory/tax/money laundering issues (not saying it is, cause that's bullshit....but y'all know how the gov't is about taxes)

As you shouldn't, this man gets it.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:59:12
Your 100% right as well.  I just try to tell my friends don't overthink what it is, hell treat it like a stock.  Buy when low sell when high

Tl;dr download a mobile or desktop wallet and get jt off the exchange.
