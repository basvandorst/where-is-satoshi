You are technically right that there is a limited amount of BTC but as easy as it is to do a hard fork it is not hard to have the same problem as printing unlimited amounts of Fiat.  There was an article that said there may be 50 hard forks in 2018.  Bitcoin is doing things to solve its problems but if it does not people can move on to other cryptos.

I am not supporting Fiat but saying if Bitcoin does not get its act together it will be replaced by other crypto coins.  Companies are dropping bitcoin as a payment method because of the transaction costs and clearing speeds.  At this point its main asset is a store of value and getting on and off exchanges.  If more people use other coins to get on and off exchanges bitcoin will slowly lose its place.  
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:39:17
The current speed and fees are killing it.  I thought by now it could be used like using a debt card in lots of stores but its main use now is the gateway coin to get on and off exchanges.  Bitcoin is even losing that because of the high fees and speed.  I have seen several YouTubes explaining how to get on exchanges suggest using ETH or LTC instead of BTC.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:58:39
I agree with that.  They are one of the few options for fiat to crypto and instead of using that to build a great exchange they like you said are incompetent or to cheap to spend the money needed to service their customers.  If another option becomes available their customers are going to leave in droves.

Fiat would be OK if every country had to really balance the budget every year unless the economy has fallen apart like in 1929 and 2008.  With the good economy we have now the government should be generating a surplus not increasing the deficit.

Technically there are 21M Bitcoins but with all the hard forks that give all owners free coins what difference does 21M make?  When the last BTC is mined all someone has to do is fork to a BTC2 with 21M more BTC2 coins.  I thought Bitcoin Cash would be about useless by now but it appears to be here to stay.

Kodak invented film and the digital camera but it went bankrupt.  One reason Bitcoin keeps its strength is it is the gateway coin and as you said the first.  The British Sterling was The reserve currency but now the US dollar holds that title.  BTC  will be around for a while just because the big players are getting into it for trading but the high fees and transaction time could really hurt its standing.

There is rich and there is very rich.  Just because you have a lot of money does not mean you have to buy a McMansion.  If you have good friends and you don't want to lose them don't say tell them about your good fortune and just gradually improve your living conditions. If you rent buy a house nearby.  You need about 1 million in today's dollars to pay for retirement for 30 years per person.  Assisted living will cost you between $5k and $10k per month per person.   If you don't want the country club life do go that route.  Just get out of debt and put the money in savings. Keep your old job or since you have the money try to find a job you enjoying go to everyday.

The best reason BTC is down would be because it went up so fast.  Now the transaction fees are so high you don't have small trades helping to hold the price up.  
The main value of BTC is the set number of coins that can be mined.  If any rich group can cause a hard fork like BCH and then compete against it is BTC really limited.

Coinbase is one of the companies that let you get into the crypto world using fiat money.  If they don't get their act together some big bank or company is going to come on the scene and instead of Coinbase adding customers they will start losing them.  CB is also one of the few exchanges that lets you buy something besides BTC with fiat.

Sorry I am in the same boat as you except I been buying ETH and LTC not BTC.  With BTC you can get on most of the other exchanges.  An investment site a friend has shown me suggests using ABRA or Gemini are using the exchanges to buy and trade other crypto coins.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:43:22
What keeps Coinbase and other exchanges open is they are needed to into the crypto world.  Right now most of them have terrible customer service because most of the biggest coins are increasing in price when the price levels out and new customers drop off or they start losing customers customer service will change or the current exchanges will go out of business.  Right now if a big bink or a big medium sized bank started to allow customers to deposit and withdraw fiat or one of the top ten cryptos or just BTC the coins would become more like currency.  Right now it is not easy to use cryptos.

The dollar does not have transaction fees.  If you and I trade BTC for LTC or LTC to BTC there is no transaction fee but if I use Coinbase there will be a transaction fee.  Just like using VISA to buy something.  Normally you don't see the fee because most stores build the fee into the price.  The people that pay cash don't get a discount the company just makes more profit. 
I have not checked the fees on Coinbase but I keep reading the miner transaction fees for BTC are higher than LTC and ETH.  If I was buying a cup of coffee at Starbucks I would use LTC before I would use BTC.

It was suppose to be a coin that you used like fiat but the "value" and fees keeps it from being used like a currency.

Could be both. If the seller agrees to except BTC instead of cash you could buy a house with BTC.  I would guess in most cases the BTC is converted to Fiat.  If someone sold for BTC on Dec 17th in the $19k range would they be happy with BTC at $14k today.  Maybe by next month BTC will be over $20k if the seller did not have to convert it to Fiat.

They will give a date but remember Saturday Sunday and holidays do not count if they are still taking 6 days to complete.  Money transfers may be going through faster now than in the past I don't know.  The Feds have told banks they should clear checks the same or next day instead of 3 or more days.  I would be happy with just 3 business days instead of the 6 business days.

To me that defeats everything BTC said it could do.  I know it is under attack but if it does not solve the problems it is having right now it will be passed over by other coins that work better.  BTC has kept its top position partly because it is the entry coin for getting on many exchanges.  If other coins also become gateway coins BTC will lose its place at the top.

I have read that higher interest rates builds better economies.  If the interest rate is low developers take bigger risks and hope it pays off.  If the interest rate is higher they have to decide will the project make enough money to pay the higher interest rate.  One change since the 2008 bust is banks have to keep some interest in big loans.  Before the bust they would be just a middleman.  It has dropped but until recently the average Joe had to put 20% down to buy a house.  Before the bust you could buy a house with nothing down at a price the real estate agent said the price was.

How did you deposit the money.  I have used CB since the spring and brought coins about every way they offer except a wire transfer.   The only time I got the coins quickly was with a credit card.  I did get a release in one week using a bank transfer when I bought on Sunday afternoon and the coins were released Friday afternoon.  It normally takes 6 business days to buy and get the coins released.  I realize when you do a bank transfer you get the coins at the price when you make the transaction but if the price is moving a $1k / day you can miss out on a lot of profit or take a big loss in a week.  You transfer just money to your CB account and it is there for trading.

I was going to post don't do it because as other poster have said it could be worth nothing or maybe over a million dollars.  You also stated the same.  I just don't think BTC will be what it is today.  My example would be T-modle Fords. They were great but over time they were replaced with better models.  In 18 years I think other coins will be the new bitcoin.  I would suggest buying the bitcoin and every few years check to see if it still the top coin or being left behind.  If it is being bypassed move to a new coin.  Even if you keep it for 18 years you may need to update the wallet every few years if Bitcoin is upgraded or you might not be able to cash it in.

The biggest problem crypto has in the US right now is the taxes if you use it like a currency.  You will pay additional taxes every time you use a crypto to buy anything else.  The only time is it not taxed is when you move it.  VISA is developing a crypto coin if it catches on and can be used like a VISA credit or debit card that could quickly replace Bitcoin.  Everything only has the value that people put on it.  Gold was down at $350 at the turn of the century when it turned around hit about $1900 and is now at $1300.

I can agree with that.  The problem is getting people to use a crypto until it loses its volatility.  They could do what India did and make their old currency worthless if you did not turn it in for the new currency. Now they have banned or are about to ban the banks from doing any transactions for crypto so a lot of cryptos are being purchased before the door shuts.

The dollar has already lost 95% of its value since becoming the major reserve currency.  If the Congress keeps spending money and the debt keeps growing another country will become the major reserve currency like the dollar did to the pound.  China is trying to do that now.  
The problem with Bitcoin is it can be replaced by another crypto people like to use better.  Right now Bitcoin has two major uses. One is the gateway coin but it is losing that place as more exchanges allow other coins to move around in the crypto world.  The second is if some other crypto catches on and is used to buy things like a credit/debt card will Bitcoin lose its place.  It only has the value people think it has today and tomorrow.  What value will it have when people have moved on to a coin that is easier and maybe cheaper to use.  Not saying Bitcoin has a great place right now but will it have value in 10 years if no one is using it except as a store of value.

You need to think of this like Kodak. It was around for 100 years making a fortune off of film.  It even invented the digital camera but its leadership did not believe in the digital camera.  Bitcoin could be around for a long time or be replaced by some coin that really catches on.  That coin may not even be on the market yet.

The price of gold had gone up and down over the years.  If you are using gold for security don't keep in in the US.  The government claimed all the gold during the Great Depression.  I would not count on Bitcoin over the long term only because it is likely some other crypto will catch on and replace it.  As more exchanges except other coins as entry coins Bitcoin loses a little of its value.  An example on the fiat side is people use to use paper money to purchase things but now people just use a credit or debt card and may have a few bills on them for an emergency.

Be careful they may not actually hold enough physical gold to cover a lot of claims for bars. One of the big gold exchanges was exposed they could not cover real gold conversions. I think it turned out the same gold had been promised to more then one group. It was like banks they make more loans then the money they have in the vault. Most of the reserves are in US Treasuries and  while they are said to be safe may not be able to pay its bills by the end of the month. Gold and anything else is only worth what a lot of people are willing to pay.

Their first problem is finding a coin that is not volatile in price on a daily basis.  I know BTC can be subdivided but today 1 BTC moved $470.  If the Fed wants a virtual currency it would be nice but I don't really want the government to know where I make all my purchases.  I use my debit card so they can see the info if they make an effort to get it from my bank.

The bankers can take over bitcoins and rule just like they do with money. It is easier with money and the current system because governments can play games with it. Bitcoin has a lot going for it but it is like anything else its value is set by the whims of the population. Its raises and falls at the whims of the market just like gold and silver. It is only as valuable as the crowd thinks it should be. It dropped to $300-$350 and then jumped to over $1500 a few years later. Bitcoins has done the same thing $200 down to $100 up to $1300 in less then a year. Bitcoin was almost killed a few weeks ago when one trading platform gained over 45% of the market.
 I hope it succeeds and every government would have to play by the same rules. But like gold that could cause other problems just as gold based currencies. Would everybody be singing the praises of bitcoin it it was priced at $10 today.

With all the electronic transfers US dollars have become almost like bitcoins. Yes physical dollars are harder to transfer long distance but that has not slowed people down lately. I would not be surprised to see dollars go almost entirely digital like bitcoin. 
Bitcoin's volatility may become one of its biggest problem which is also a problem with gold. It is great when the price goes up for those that bought cheap but bad like stocks if you buy high and sell low. If bitcoins cause deflation that can do as much damage as inflation and could hurt the bitcoin cause long term as a major substitute for sovereign currency. If nothing else one good thing bitcoin may do is make countries quit destroying their currency.

Unless Bitcoin gets hacked or a few big exchanges fail Bitcoin should be here to stay. The thing that could hurt it the most is availability when it hits its limit of production. A lot of people want a currency based on the gold standard but it would be really hard to set the price of a currency to measurement of gold. There has to be enough units of Bitcoin so the value is not jumping up and down like it did when bitcoin rose skyhigh  in value and then collapsed in terms of dollars. Volatility will create more problems with acceptance then most other factors. That may not be a problem if like the Dollar is excepted everywhere now. In the US it does not matter if it is bouncing against the Yen. 
Just remember even if Bitcoin is THE worldwide currency its value will go up and down because of human nature. It will go up and down for the same reason a stock goes up and down when nothing has changed. 
Just remember a single world Bitcoin currency does not solve all problems. Countries will game the system. Look at Greece or look at how individual states in the US try to game the system.

If they lend at one to one there would be high fees to pay for operations.  Also loans would cost more because they were making money from a one to one ratio.  Doing fractional reserve banking can be save if the ratio is high enough and the way the money is used is not overly risky.

Right now people are going to do a dollar conversion to compare the price like someone from Europe might do convert the dollar price to Euros while shopping in the US.  I was going for the satoshis to 1 USD.  I am just suggesting the 7 zeros from the decimal place need to be named for every three zero spaces.  I think of it like using hundred, thousand, million, billion and trillion when talking about dollar and I guess Euros.  The Bitcoin needs the same thing below one bitcoin.

Not if BTC drops by $400 or some other smaller amount.  In theory the price of BTC of $2000 before should become BTC + BCC = $2000 after you receive the BCC.  Your profit or loss will be the price of BTC + BCC greater or less than $2000.  BCC is not free until you sell both at a profit.  They are just hope on an exchange.  Same with stocks on a stock exchange.

The difference is the penny/cent, nickle, dime, and quarter all have a set value to the dollar.  The problem is bitcoin value is related or priced to the major fiat currencies. In the US we don't normally relate the dollar to the Euro or pound.  Bitcoin needs to come up with some smaller units like cents and quarters that are easy to divide.  
Does the rest of the world use 100. 1,000. 1,000,000 or three place holders like we do.  I know the million unit is sometimes used to reference what we call billion.

You may be right.  I could see the 3 day time because it took one day to get the transfer request into the Fed ACH system queue batch.  I think they do a batch in the morning and one in the afternoon. The second day the bank has gotten and processed the withdrawal back to the Fed ACH and money sent to the requesting financial institution who has to post it into an account.  
I don't understand why this can't be completed in minutes or an hour.  I understand the banks make money holding the funds.  The payroll company makes a lot of their profits on overnight deposits.

If it was not for the dumb money as you call it the price would not go up. It is also showing a big weakness in BTC.  If a group has the money and hash power they can manipulate the coin.  My question is if BCH becomes competitive or overtakes BTC would that not mean BCH is controlled by a group with control of more than 51% of the miners. Are not most of those miners in China?  Do people want to own BCH and China could cause problems at any time. Right now BTC is losing hash power in this fight.

We can hope.  If not and he got out near the top he can use the ill got gains to torment BTC even more.

Right now BTC could be replaced as top dog by a coin that can handle more than 500k transactions per second and very low transaction fees.

If it is electronic you will have a problem someday.  ATT can cause the same problem as having a concentration on the cloud.  In fact if the cloud server uses ATT and ATT has a major failure it could isolate more than one big cloud server.  Most of the time they try to have backup plans where AWS uses different carriers to different sever locations.  If ATT had a major nationwide failure it would take down all nodes that used ATT as their ISP.  The same with Comcast or Spectrum ISP and a nationwide failure.  That is not an easy fix. There is not a problem with using AWS until someone starts pushing it and a lot of people that would not have thought of that option follow that suggestion and you end up with a large concentration of nodes using AWS.  You have decentralized ownership of the nodes but centralized location of nodes.

Start buying now when you are young until you get 360 to 400 units of a coin.  The 360 comes from the number of months in 30 years.  If you retire between 65 and 70 that would cover you in retirement until you are 95 to 100.  With BTC at $8000 you can could buy one coin and could it as 12 units.  In that case you would need 30 or less coins if the price keeps going up.  If you bought Litecoin at the current price of $70 360 coins would be $25k plus.  Not saying buy all 360 units at once but figure out what you can afford each week or month and buy that amount at the current price.  If the coin or coins you buy keep going up you will retire better off than how you are living now.  You may only be able to afford $25/week or month right now but keep increasing the amount if you can until you hit the 360 to 400 cheaper altcoins or units of Bitcoin.  If Bitcoin keeps going up as predicted you would only need 5 or 6 Bitcoins.

If you retire in in your mid 60s you need 360 to 400 units of Bitcoin.  A unit can be $20 or more just an amount you can afford each week or month.  The lower the amount the longer it will take to reach the 360 units.  You will need 5 to 6 BTC equivalent at the price BTC is today around $8k to $10k.  I am doing this with ETH and LTC.  Getting in now I may do 360 to 400 of each.  It may take 30 years of buying to reach your goal.  
If someone is retiring today you need at least $1million to live off of for 30 years.  If you need assisted living it can cost $5k / month in dollars.

Most US customers have to use Coinbase to go from dollars to a small number of 4 cryptos.  If it becomes possible to easily get from dollars to crypto on Binance their customer base will greatly expand.  Not being a US company will make it harder to move dollars to Binance.

Crypto coins of any kind are only as valuable as people think they are. That is the same with fiat a current example is Venezuela with its hyperinflation.  Another example is the Dollar when it became the petro dollar. It is excepted almost anywhere in the world.  Someday I would say a crypto maybe Bitcoin or another coin that has not been thought of yet. 
If a crypto is going to catch on it will have to do like VISA credit/debit cards work.  You think it is free to use the card but the transaction fee is built into the price of the item because if you had to pay a fee you might not buy the item.  I have read VISA is developing a cryto coin card.  If that becomes wide spread like credit cards are that may be the cryto that replaces fiat.

What the government is regulating at Coinbase is customers using cryptos to hide illegal activity.  If Coinbase does not want to deal with hard forks like Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash the customer can use another exchange.  Government is not regulating that.  The only problem I saw with Coinbase was they were not prepared to handle the traffic of people trying to move their coins off the Coinbase exchange and some people that tried to move off the exchange may have lost out.  Coinbase did say they will deal BCash next year but BCash may not be worth much by then.  
The only regulation I want to see if you are a legal customer and the exchange offers storage is if they are hacked they make their customers good just like a bank if they are robbed.  If the exchange wants to say your coins are not protected then it is my decision to do business with them.

I got interested when it was in the $10 range but it kept jumping up until it was over $100.  At that point I thought it was too expensive.  Now I would rather buy ETH or LTC.  When I buy BTC it will be time for everybody else to sell.
There was a story in Business Insider by Will Martin about BTC what it cost to supply his house with electricity for a month just to confirm a transaction he may have meant a block of transaction.  His point was the electricity cost was going to make it hard to do small purchases if the processing costs for mining were so high.  
The title was "The electricity required fora single bitcoin trade could power a house for a whole month."
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:15:46
You keep the stop loss in your head because it is a moving point.  So you don't have to move anything until it hits the sell percentage.  If the price keeps moving up that means less bitcoins you have to sell.  If bitcoin doubles or even multiples amounts in price from here  
It is not really a good idea to put a sell stop on an exchange for any investment.  You never know when something is going to cause a flash crash like ETH had that recovered in a few minutes. I know stock exchanges halt trading if a flash crash starts.  Some of the crypto exchanges have also done some things short of stopping trading.

The micro transactions do matter and with just SegWit lightning will now work with Bitcoin.  If you want Bitcoin to catch on it needs a reason to exist.  It is not going to matter if people just trade Bitcoins.  If Bitcoin does move to general use some other crypto will and Bitcoin will fade away.  The main reason it has the status it has is Bitcoin is the entry crypto to get to other cryptos. If I can do that with ETH or LTC as easy or easier than Bitcoin why do I need Bitcoin.

I got the feeling Coinbase was going alone with 2x was to keep from getting sued.  They are going to process it only because of the slight chance 2x could win the battle of being the dominant coin.  I admit I can not keep up with the cast of characters that are pushing 2x.  I hope we hear 2x is having as little support as Bcash is gaining and by the end of the year 2x will be failing to catch on.  
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:06:34
Both side played a game.  The 2x side withheld their support from SegWit unless they got support for 2x.  SegWit was needed and it has shown BTC has better clearing times.  Not sure if the clearing times problems were manufactured before SegWit because less than 10% of the transactions are clearing with even SegWit why do we need 2x.  
Miners will hate this but if Bitcoin does not reduce the transaction fees it may lose its place at the head of line because people will not use it for small transactions like buying a cup of coffee if the fees are 20% to 50% of the price of the coffee.  That will make bitcoin harder to catch on.  
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:03:59
When do you suggest selling when it drops 75% and you are at a loss?  I was sayin when it hit 30% drop sell everything just the amount he had paid to buy all his coins.  After that he would not incur a loss except on paper.   
The other option is as the price goes up would be for every $1k or $5k increase in the price of Bitcoin sell $100 or $500 until all costs are paid off and anything from that point is pure profit.  It is his choice and so far hodling has paid off.

Coinbase is between a rock and a hard place if they don't do something they get sued if they do something they get sued.

I get the feeling if BTC wins that is what they want but should BTC2X wins they feel forced to go with 2X.  If you don't like what they are doing move your BTC.  Looking at what they did with BCH bitcoin cash it looks like the coin may not be worth much by the end of the year when Coinbase will let you have access to the airdrop coin BCH.

It will be hard to get to 100% because some hodlers may not do anything with paper wallets they have put in a safe deposit box.

I will let everybody else think of ways access to a bitcoin could be lost forever.

I thought that too until the cost/amount of electricity to mine Bitcoin went through the roof.  Bitcoin is the Model -T of the day and something will replace it that has a very low tx fee verifies a tx in seconds.  One problem most of the cryptos have today is processing the blockchain.  There is a lot of data to store the whole blockchain and what will the size of the blockchain look like in 10 years if Bitcoin starts being used like Visa cards are used today.  If someone buys a Bitcoin today and hodls it for 10 years how long would it take to validate that transaction.   
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:16:39
If it had not become a trading asset then it would be useless because no one would spend the money to mine BTC because of the electricity costs.

The problem I see with Bitcoin is like the Ford Model T it will be replaced by a newer better model of coin.  The other big problem is taxes are hurting the use of Bitcoin.

This comment is not meant to be mean and I understand why you are buying from China.  They are cheaper.  When you and other people buy from China you are hurting workers in the US.  I don't know if China was stopped by tariffs but China was flooding the US solar market with cheap under cost solar panels to keep American solar panel companies out of the market.  Indirectly when you buy from China you are hurting the sales of your own produce sales because money that leaves the US and does not return when China buys stuff from the US makes the country poorer over time.  I have no problem trading with Europe because they buy a lot from the US but with China it tends to be a one way flow.  Last China wants to kill the dollar as the reserve currency of the world and if that happens the US economy will take a big hit.  If it does not as many people will be able to afford your produce or buy Bitcoins.  All I am saying is everybodies love of China's cheap prices can come back to haunt you.

i need to figure out what they mean by transactions.  When they talk about Bitcoin the transaction rate is around 7 transaction per second.   Visa does peak around 56,000 transaction.  Visa is developing its own crypto.  The crypto that can move from cryto to currency and back instantly with something like a card will win the battle.  If it successful enough people will skip the currency.  The Univ of Sydney is working on a blockchain called Red Belly that has done 440,000 transaction per second in tests.

Maybe the best thing for BTC is for Ver and Jihan to move to BCC and hope it does not catch on.  Yes you lose a lot of miners but it looks like if they stay it looks like they are going to end up taking over BTC.  Then it will be so much for decentralization of BTC.

That seems to be a problem Bitcoin and Ether are going to have to solve.  It was not a problem until the interest for cryptos exploded this year. I think Ethereum has done more on the problem than Bitcoin.   Poster r/whitslack above had a better answer. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:47:29
I would say bitcoin is holding because it is the best coin to get into the crypto market. If or when another coin like ETH can be used bitcoin will lose some of its value.  If Coinbase started letting people convert dollars to any of the top ten cryptos bitcoin would have to compete more on its own strengths. If the BTC market blows up because of Aug 1st exchanges may open the door to using other coins for entry.  
@_date: 2017-07-08 13:22:57
As a user I have decided to stay out of BTC until after Aug1.  If Jihan wins this battle I will not be back.  There are a lot other coins like LTC that could move into the BTC space.  You guys can say what you want but the main reason for BTC strength is it is the entry coin to buy other coins on exchanges.  if Aug1 causes big problems for several weeks or longer entry doors to exchanges ill open for LTC, ETH and other top 10 coins.  The high transaction fees are made look for other ways to the same thing using other coins.  The death nail to BTC is when the banking systems decide to use some other coin to replace the ACH money transfer system. If that coin can be used like a Visa / Mastercard inside and out the banking system Bitcoin usage will dry up.   Visa has announced they are looking to develop some alt-coin. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 10:25:28
This is a new alt-coin still in early testing but would be a big jump in transaction handling if it works.  It can handle 400,000 transaction per second on 100 machines.  Visa does 56,000 peak.  And this is Bitcoins big problem because it is limited to around 7 transactions per second.  
In the real world this may fall on its face.  If it does not have problem it may take over.  I realize even a news outlet like Znet tend to see the positive side on new developments plus the people they interview are going to talk about how great their development will be.

My guess is the coin that wins in a few years from now will be the coin that the public finds the easiest to use.  By that I mean to switch from fiat currency and back.  I don't think most people in the general public will care if it is decentralized or not. Do they care that Visa is centralized. No they just want to be able to swipe their card.   Visa is studying a crypto a lot of people would use that service just because they use Visa cards now. It looks like Ethereum may pass Bitcoin by the end of the year in total value.  I thought Ripple was going to be the coin of choice for transaction between banks to replace the slow ACH money transfer system.  It may be but I read where other bank groups are coming up with other blockchain systems.

That was my question.  I saw the first part of a WSJ article and they said the fees had been up to $5 but were down to either $2.50 or $3.50 the article was firewalled.  If what you are buying is less than $10 or $20 that is a high fee.  At one point in the near past it was less than a nickle. If the fees stay that high it is going to be hard to get people to use it for everyday purchases.

What will happen is they will get the tax as a sales tax instead of income tax.  The rich will like that for the same reasons they like sales tax on dollars the further down the income ladder the higher your percentage of tax you pay on your income.

If Bitcoin splits and you end up with two different coins like ETH and ETC which one is going to be the one that becomes popular.  If Bitmain can catch on and be more profitable buyers will move to the Bitmain coin.  The best way to stop that is to boycott him out of the gate and make his coin second rate and it will be an Alt-coin not the new Bitcoin.   I am just saying money/profits talk and many people will sell their soul over it.  If the Chinese government has anything to do with Bitmain it is because they want to kill the US Dollar as the worlds reserve currency.  Bitcoin is the worlds cryptocurrency reserve coin and China would love to have some control.  Just remember the Chinese government is run by control freaks and if they can control anything that trades they will go after that control.

Maybe not when the price recovered as fast as it did.  Most people may not have lot anything or very little if they had not had the automatic stop loss orders.

r/knircky is right most people will go with the money.  Most users are not going to give up $100, $200 or a $1000 because they don't like the group that wins.  The biggest threat is those people will move to another coin like ETH or LTC or something else.  Bitcoin has its status because it is the biggest gateway between money and cryptocurrency markets.  If Aug 1 and the next few weeks go badly for whatever happens to Bitcoin it could lose its place as THE reserve coin.  Everything might go great and Bitcoin will be even stronger.  Personally I don't like the Chinese control.

I think some of the Banks like BoA have helped fund ripple so they have some input but your point could be how it turns out.  One problem I have seen with big companies is they get so bureaucratic they have a hard time executing anything new.  They need some young upstart company to do something like ripple.

The value of everything is what people are willing to pay for it.  In most places in the US water is wasted because it is cheap.  I lived in the Virgin Islands for awhile and water was treated like gold because it was an effort to have enough without paying for it.  The price of a house could be more than $100k plus more if the rain pattern of was better in one location.  You caught your water on the roof and saved it under the house, in a big water tank or you paid several hundred dollars for a tank full of water.  
I have read that gold would be at $5000 for at least two years but it has been flat.  Why maybe because people are betting on bitcoin or other crypto currencies instead of gold and silver.  Betting on the new thing in the news is a good way to get rich, break even or lose money.  I just used the tulip mania because it was one of the first in history that made a lot of people rich and in the end hurt a lot of people that did not even own a tulip.  If Bitcoin was not divisible I bet its price would be about $100 but I would not be surprised if it hits $10k unless another crypto unseats it.

One of the things helping Bitcoin is to get into the system you have to buy BTC but that is beginning to breakdown.  ETC and LTC are just beginning to be excepted as entry coins.   One cryto that might take the wind out of Bitcoin is Ripple, XRP which the banking system is developing to use to transfer money around the world with out all the paper work.   The ACH money transfer system takes 3 to 6 days to transfer money in the US.  With Ripple it will be in minuets or less.  It is the biggest banks supporting this so it should last.  Bitcoin is worth something because people think it has value as a transfer medium.

What GDAX needs to do is not accept an order that big or install a halt if the price drops to fast.  If Coinbase is going go offline and you can't get to your accounts what is the difference than a short halt on GDAX.  
People do not listen when they are told don't invest if you can not afford to lose it all.  This is an example of why stop loss orders are dangerous. You never know when they are going to get triggered in a fast moving market.  On the stock market big players will track where the stop loses are and put in large buy orders just under where the stop orders are hit.

If the users get feed up with the delays caused by the fighting among the different Bitcoin groups they can start buying something like LTC or some other coin that will replace Bitcoin.

The ACH system is an example of why the government no longer functions.  The world changes and the regulators act like nothing has changed in 25 years.  The banks and other companies like Coinbase will use the old clearing days times to make money off of deposits.  Ripple is the banks BankChainRipple network.  It is more for moving money across borders than in the US.  I thought I had read more of the big US banks were in the network than BoA and maybe JP Morgan.

Not in a crashing market. There are two kinds of stop loss.  One triggers the coin to be put on the market when the price is triggered but it may be sold at a lower price.  The other is a triggered sell at a given price.  If the market is dropping so fast there are not enough buyers at that price the coins will not be sold until the price returns to that price or higher.  If the price never comes back up to that price you still own the coins.

The ACH should not take more than 3-4 working days if the transfer is in before 12 noon on a working day.  The transfer should be done overnight and in the end account by the close of business the next day. I can use my Visa debit card at lunch and the transaction may show up on my bank account that day so money can be moved fast.

You need to order the Ledger now because it will be a few weeks before they ship if you order from Ledger.  They are opening a new production plant so the date may be sooner. 
IF some one is planning on just keeping the coins for say retirement would a paper wallet be better unless you are going to keep adding some coins on a regular basis.   I ask this because the units run on batteries or a recharge so if stored in a safety deposit box for a long time could you lose the coins.

If Bitcoin dies another alt-coin will take it place. Right now Bitcoin is successful because it is the cryptocurrency reserve coin of choice like the dollar is the biggest reserve currency in the world.  Ask Great Britain why they lost that title to the US.  
In the future the coin that will become the reserve coin will be the coin the banks make it easy to convert your local currency into the cryptocurrency network.  If a big bank like Wells Fargo that has branches in a lot of small towns with populations over 10k decided to pick alt-coin X and when you walked in you could get money that was USD or X and the exchanges would treat X like it does Bitcoin now Bitcoin would see a big change.  If BoA, smaller banks and Credit Unions also chose X you would see Bitcoins reserve status decrease.  If Bitcoin messes this up for several months it could greatly hurt its status.

With every system there breaks.  If a country does not keep control of it debt it comes back to haunt them.  The US gets away with more than most other countries because the dollar is the major Reserve Currency in the world.  Every money system in the world is subject to the same problems as the Tulip Mania in the 17th century.  The British had the worlds Reserve Currency the Sterling until the US moved in with the petro dollar. China is trying to take the title from the Reserve Currency.  They are buying their way into country after country.  People want something until the crowd moves on to something new.  Bitcoin is great until some other coin shows up.  The coin that will win the race is the coin that a bank like Wells Fargo with lots of local branches give you a choice of crypto or dollar in your account.  If several large banks go for the same coin or system that will be the coin or system that bumps the dollar and most likely around the world.  One clue of the winner is the system used to transfer funds between banks around the world and in the US.  The ACH money transfer system is outdated and what ever crypto replaces it will become the coin of choice if the public is allowed to use the crypto used in the transfer.  They could crypto the dollar.

The other problem was the system designed to scale easily.  A system designed to add 1000 to 5000 new customers a day will have a hard time if that jumps to 40k a day in just a few days unless it was designed to add that volume.  Now that Coinbase has been burned a few times they may change to a design where they just need to increase the number of servers. No one saw the interest in bitcoin increasing so much in just few weeks.

One of the things that keeps BTC on top is it is the reserve cryptocurrency you almost always have to use to buy any other alt-coin but ETH and LTC.  It is hard to use ETH or LTC to buy other alt-coins.

The "dollar" is going crypto in a way.  I seldom ever deal with cash I just use a Visa debit or credit card.  My bank is two hours away.  I use the internet to pay bills. Since my pay check is automatically deposited I have about quit writing checks or using real money.  In China they did $5.5 Trillion in mobile payments.  Most were with Alipay or WeChat Pay apps.  A street performer took coins or mobile pay.  The story was on NPR on the 29th.
A mobile pay system world wide could leave Bitcoin on the curb if it does not do anything but transfer a value from point to point.  Ethereum / ETH at least does something more than transfer what ever bitcoin is worth that minute from one wallet to another wallet.

You BTC lovers should be happy this happened because ETH was about to pass BTC as the coin with the biggest value.  BTC has held its status because most exchanges require you to come through the door with BTC to buy other alt-coins.  As more companies like Coinbase let you buy ETH and LTC without going through a BTC /USD trade first BTC will become less important.  It looks like things a re getting better for Aug 1st upgrades BTC looked like it could be in trouble.  If BTC becomes centralized it could have problems.

They could have problems if as more people move to crypto.  Banks make their money by loaning the money customer leave at the bank in savings and checking accounts. If everybody keeps their coins in private wallets there is nothing to loan.  It will be what happens when there is a run on banks and people keep their money under the bed.

Most people can not afford to buy the A shares but many more can afford 1 or the normal 100 share blocks. You just have more demand after a stock split because you have more people that can afford to buy in.

The one problem with the split is how the miners are controlled.  The SegWit pools are open to everyone while the BTU would be controlled by the big Chinese pools that no one knows who really controls the miners.  Does anyone really think these miners can operate without the OK or maybe even run by the government.  The government had shut down money transfers but had just reopened the use of Bitcoin.  It has been suggested the reason Bitcoin is up again is because the Chinese wealthy are moving money out of the country using Bitcoin.

One of the reasons the Great Depression went on for years was because the dollar was linked to gold the good times of the 20's went bust and deflation set in.  The biggest problem with the dollar is Congress not having to pass a balanced budget. It is not so much the balanced budget but when times are bad they spend more money that helps and then when times are good the cut taxes instead of paying down the debt incurred when times were bad.  
Bitcoin is just like the tulip mania in the 17th century.  I don't know if it will be the coin of choice in 50 months or 50 years. The British Sterling was the currency of choice until the dollar or petro dollar took the title.  China is trying to take the title from the dollar.  Bitcoin may become the international coin of exchange or something like Ethereum / ETH could replace BTC because companies are using it to write contracts.  They might say why convert my ETH to BTC when I can just spend my ETH and not have to pay a fee to convert to BTC then back to ETH for the next contract.  It may be a crypto coin that is not even on the market today.  
I got interested in BTC when it was $10 but the price jumped and my brain thought it was to expensive now it is cheap because it down from $3000.  The other reason was it was not as easy to buy when it was under $50 as it is today.  The only reason it is more valuable is because people think it will be more valuable in the future.

It becomes the other exchanges problem not the one that stopped an order like this one that crashed the market.  The only other thing Coinbase could do is not except any order over a certain size in the future.  The stop trading works on the NYSE and futures exchanges is because they are almost a monopoly in public trading.  A big order like that in a stock would be handled off the exchange or would trigger a halt in trading.

I agree but if fractional banking is not used with Bitcoin loans will be more expensive.  I expect there will be people that will leave coins the  crypto bank has access too just like they leave dollars.  They can do that or they can pay fees every time they do a transaction.  Banks do that with dollar accounts now if you have over a certain amount in your accounts you get services free.  Normally it is the biggest banks the smaller banks and credit unions don't charge fees even if you have $25.  Most people don't realize everytime the use a credit card or debit card somebody pays several percentage to the CC or BC company.  It may be the merchant just raised the price on their goods and services by that percentage. People that pay cash might get nothing for cash.  If transactions move to crypto things may change or we might not see any difference.  
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:44:04
That was interesting.  The original huge order started the avalanche but it alone did not do that much damage.  What caused the avalanche to grow was the stop loss orders that tripped more stop loss orders as the price kept dropping.  Stop loss orders can be a good thing in a normal market but most people don't realize the stop loss just triggers a sale it does not mean the coin/stock will be sold at that price.  A lot of people in the stock market get burned by a trader selling stock to trigger stop loss orders so they can place a big buy order and make a bigger profit as the price returns to normal.  If some one was watching ETH on GDAX and got an order in when ETH started recovering from the $0.10 price at say $10 and bought $100 worth of ETH they would be doing well as long as they held those 10 ETH coins.  It would almost be impossible to now lose money on that trade.

Anything you do is going to hurt someone.  I think GDAX had to shut down for a short time anyway.  One trade should not be able to trigger a crash.  If Coinbase / GDAX is not going to put in some safeguards then they need to put in big letters that one big sell trade may trigger big loses in stop loss orders.  I don't care if they did not refund the money but it is good PR.  They should say don't expect a refund next time.  I am a customer of Coinbase but only found out about about the crash when I tried to take a quick look that afternoon and they said the ETH section or site was off line.  Coinbase needs to get their act together.

Ask Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht how that worked out for him.  Yes you can do some small transactions and keep yourself hidden but if bitcoin became the currency of exchange all you have to do is start connecting the dots.  I would say you could hide better using dollars than bitcoin on a regular basis.  Inflation is another story.  Bitcoin is becoming the currency of choice in Venezuela because of the hyperinflation.  
Just remember the price of something is determined by what people are willing to pay. Gold like bitcoin has a cap but if you look at a price chart of gold for each year since 1972 the price jumps all over the place.  In 1972 the high was $70 and low was $44 now gold is $1257.00.  Bitcoin can jump up or down $200 in an hour.

Most big cities have money problems. The reason is the rich want the city to have all the big expensive things like sports teams and the arts but if you notice they don't want to live in the city proper. Most of super rich or even the middle class  live in their own private towns or the next county. The football owner in our town wants over $100 million to remodel the stadium or the team moves. The name of the team is the Carolina Panthers but Charlotte was the only place to fall for the blackmail. That only keeps the team for 6 years and some refund for 10. Even as bad as the team is the owner made over $100 million profit from the team.  
I work with guys that want to live outside the towns to save on taxes but they bring their trash and throw it into the company's dumpsters.
I was shocked to hear poor people on welfare are more willing to help someone worse off them them then people making over $200k. They may give a large dollar sum but percentage wise it is less then the poor.  Normally when they give they will get it back plus in some deal.  Most of the time it is your taxes.

When you peg something to something else they get out of whack over time. You have the same problem with the dollar pegged to gold or the dollar pegged to Bitcoins. It would be the same problems pegging Bitcoins to the dollar. The only system that really works and it has its own problems is to let the value of one thing float compared to another. 
An example would be the a cars that were the same model and the only difference was color. If there is a higher demand for one color then the sales department can get a higher price for cars of that color. How do keep the peg if one side is in more demand then the other side. It does not take long to end up with an official rate peg and a off market price.

I look at it as buy stock in a new company the banking system wants to use to replace the old failing system that in the US may take 6 days on the ACH main Fed network.  The people that want to stay hidden have other options I am just looking for a system with the speed a credit / debt card have with lower fees.   When companies like Google, Bank of America and other companies of that size are backing the system there is a good chance it will succeed.  I am looking at Ripple as long term holding not to trade.  The cost is very low like Bitcoin was for years. If you bought when it was below $20 dollars it would look like a good deal now. Ripple may not be the next Bitcoin but there is something backing its success where something like Bitcoin Lite like Bitcoin is just hope that goes up and down because people believe or don't believe it has value.

Coinbase is a good place to start.  They limit the amount you can buy or trade at first and gradually up the amount.  That keeps someone new from doing something stupid when they start.  I have been a customer for about 5 months just before the first big wave of customers signed up and overwhelmed Coinbase.  My limit has gone up to $15k / month of purchases.  It normally takes 6 business days for money to transfer from your bank on the free ACH Fed system.  
There are two sides to leaving your money with Coinbase or keeping it in your own wallet.  They charge you to move your coins. You will also be charged to bring your coins back to an exchange.  If you move your coin to any wallet if you lose your passcodes / keys your coins are gone.  You need to keep your keys in more than one safe place just in case you have a fire or flood which could destroy your key info.  That even includes Coinbase or any exchange.  Coinbase is a good place to start until you learn your way around the neighborhood.  They have their faults but as others have said they appear to be very safe.  Part of their faults is they try to be very safe.  They trade three coins BTC, ETH and LTE.  They should be adding BCH/Bitcoin Cash the first of the year.  
Good luck to your Dad.  The best advice is not to put more in than you can lose.  If he follows that he can have fun if it goes up or down.  If he lives another 20 years plus you may be very rich if you are in the will.

Right now bitcoin's biggest problem is the volatility that will level out for the same reasons the dollar and the euro don't jump $100 in a single day. As the market gets bigger it will be harder to have the huge daily jumps like we had up in Nov and down in Dec. 
Merchants should look at bitcoin like they do Visa and MasterCard. Check out Coinbase.com. No fee to process if the merchant keeps the bitcoin. The fee is 1% if the merchant converts to currency.

When you mix economics theory and politics things go bad. It is human nature to go from boom to bust and back to boom over and over. In most cases the politicians will not cut off a successful program until it is causing damage. 
A good example is the national debt. It is not a problem to go into debt when the economy is tanking like in 2008 and 2009 but the contry should have been running a surplus before then when the economy was looking good. Instead of balancing the budget Bus put 2 wars on the credit card and reduced taxes. Politicians get reelected by spending money and lowering taxes.

I have learned you can't have a conversation with people like you. But to answer you question for the case you presented the answer is no. If those people owned the house with me then I would say Yes. Depending on how the contract was written they would have to pay me for my share. 
Actually if you had enough money to get the local government to force me out for a private development then you could. The Supreme Court ruled a private development company can force you to sell even if you do not want to sell your property just like the government can take your land for a road or public school.
