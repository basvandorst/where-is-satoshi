2. Unless the author had malicious intent, this is not FUD but true record of his experience, sucks ass it's a negative one.
3. We know this is due to AML and KYC laws, it doesn't change the fact that it sucks. I'm not going to give my details to every single ATM operator before using his machine. I'll just sell my coins on an exchange for more favorable rate, transfer fiat to my bank account and withdraw from there.
4. Mainstream users won't ponder and reason why it takes 45 minutes or even 10 to get their cash, they'll just scoff at magic Internet money and head to nearby bank's ATM and be done in 2 minutes. Bitcoin is about being better, faster, cheaper, more convenient, this is anything but evolutionary.

If you feel the need to spew vile shit over a silly matter then you have bigger fucking problems, have it checked out. 
Your post is flawed because in the beginning of ASIC era miners *were* money making machines, as long as Bitcoin had value, it's like everyone was using spoons and shovels to mine and you rolled in Bagger 288. It didn't make sense for first company to ship devices if they could profit from them themselves, and that's what BFL did, they delayed shipments entire months, while ~~milking~~ testing them; there were reports of people receiving miners with visible signs of use. Even now when playfield has leveled with competition and market saturation miners are money makers, disregarding initial and electricity cost for the sake of the argument, because even 1kh/s is guaranteed to turn profit if you do pool mining, it scales linearly with the size of the shovel.

Standalone, desktop client (node-webkit) is preferable in my opinion, and has few advantages: skips browser requirement; alternatively saves you time from maintaining several versions for different browsers; protects from possibly malicious auto-update; is more secure as I can keep it on USB drive; has better feel to it. Also should be more straightforward to implement than an extension.
Until v1, could you please put up fat warning that you're potentially insecure so users test it with small amounts? Nothing happens hopefully, but in case it does, it will save you PR drama, and spare us, the bitcoin community, from another egg on our face.
Lastly, thanks for your work, the app looks great and I'm looking forward for the release.

Depends what your objective is, if you want to do it for fun or learn stuff, then get something cheaper, if your goal is profit, then you'll be better off by just buying the coins. According to [this]( mining calculator you'll break even after 440 days, assuming that price and difficulty will stay the same, which most likely won't. You risk never making your money back by buying the miner, and stand a good chance to profit handsomely if you go the coin route.

Really? Pyramid scheme is a system where early investors are profiting from late comers, which in turn recruit new investors to profit themselves (network effect). Bitcoin has characteristic of a pyramid scheme, no doubt, because it was necessary for kickstarting the project and gaining  traction/adoption, otherwise it would be dead by now, not too many idealists around but everyone understands profit. Where it differs from a standard PS is that Bitcoin is actually useful and provides (non-monetary) value on its own.

It's not so simple, enough resources were invested in bitcoin at this point to feel safe about its dominance in crypto world for the time being. Bitcoin strength lies in it's network, which is largest and computationally strongest in entire world, many times over, not just crypto world. For some other coin to take its place it would need to be vastly better, slightly better does not cut it at this point.

Frankly these posts don't inspire any confidence, first talks about offline transactions using Armory and advises to check output char by char (who has time for that), the other acknowledges bitflip errors being able to wipe wallet clean, but doesn't offer any solution.

Uh, no. I've only given Amazon as an example of a solid company with great customer support that will always act in their best interest. Another matter is that their support and low prices often make me use their services. Goes the same with other companies that I do regular business with and proven to be trustable, or paying utility bills.
Regarding stolen cards, I've never had to deal with it, but I'm paying hidden insurance fee all of my life, in fact if I got robbed at this point, I would still come ahead. Besides, it's far easier to steal the card than bitcoin wallet over the internet, every time you make payment online, you have to trust other party not to use your card details elsewhere, how cool is that?
I don't scream "death to cards", I simply want to have a choice to use alternative payment method that cost me less.

If I met you at the bar, you would only know my face and first name, maybe, and that's it. You couldn't point at me and say "hey bartender, tell me every place this guy goes to, and everything he ever said", so while being out in the public, my identity and life are still kept private. Meatspace argument is also flawed, as we all have different "faces" depending on setting. I'm different to my boss at work, different to my family, different to my parents in law, different to one group of my friends, and different to other. Why should the internet be any different? What if someone was closeted gay but wanted to talk to like minded people? What about wife seeking help from her abusive husband?

Glad to hear it, I was wondering what can be done given decentralized nature of OB and the fact it will be often hosted on a slow consumer grade hardware/networks. The best I came up with is centralized search/proxy server to bring experience on par with Amazon/Ebay, but I'm no specialist.
One thing, since you're the developer, how do you guys feel about multiuser version to provide Ebay like service? The idea is that majority of people are non technical and unable to setup and manage OB for themselves, which could hamper OB adoption. I'm sure people will come up with paid store management services, but that's cost and extra effort for store owner and running one shop per vm is wasteful.

Garza is confirmed scammer from his telecom years, paycoin is basically a scam, Hashtalk forum is heavily censored and inquisitive users banned, GAW has history of silencing bad press with legal action (Coinfire), so here is your proof: Occam's razor.

Definitely should do that, but maybe don't deem it necessary, too busy with other stuff, don't have straightforward access to the keys (multisig split between multiple parties and/or geographical locations). Up to this point Bitstamp behaved professionally and had good track record, so I have no reason to believe they would decide to play dirty now.

Seller on the right tried to move price down by fear inducing huge ask wall, intent was to trigger panic selling. He moved his price lower and lower, until some white knight decided to protect that price point by putting up huge bid wall on the left (psychologically this increases market confidence). What you see here is situation where there is half cent price difference between bid and ask and seller does not really want to sell their coins into bid wall, nor buyer really want to buy into that ask wall. Eventually ask wall has been taken down by smaller buy orders. 
This is my interpretation, for all you know this could be one guy, playing with the market for some wicked reasons.
