Meet in a highly populated public place during the daytime. 
Is that so hard?

Satoshi Nakamoto is not Japanese. He wrote perfect British-style English on all his forum posts.

There is no such thing as an actual Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just a ledger that shows the account balances of all the different Bitcoin addresses. To be able to spend from one of these public addresses, you need the corresponding private key. To summarize: all Bitcoin wallets simply store your private keys, which allow you to spend from all your public Bitcoin addresses.
Example: you could create your own Bitcoin wallet by putting all your private keys in a text file on your desktop. This isn't the most efficient or secure way to do it, but in essence it would have the same function as all the other Bitcoin wallets.

It's when the block reward for mining a Bitcoin block goes from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.

The thread in worldnews is cancer. Almost confirms the fact that we are still in early adopter territory.

Why don't you store your key on an encrypted USB drive as well? I don't understand your thought process or how you think this is beneficial to you.

Blockchain.info is owned by Roger Ver.

People don't understand why Bitcoin is so revolutionary and important. That's why they think its energy consumption is a bad and unnecessary thing. Once people adopt Bitcoin and understand why it is needed, they will understand why it must consume energy.

I understand this can be done. My question is if adding Electrum server (now ElectrumX) into the equation causes any issues or creates any instability or vulnerabilities.
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:58:49
Blockchain.info is owned by Roger Ver. Nice try though.

Remove the price ticker and it will be acceptable.
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:41:29
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:55:13
Absolutely awful. The old bitcoin.org was perfect, and I never saw any reason to change it in the first place. Also, remove that price ticker. Who thought any of this was a good idea?
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:35:34
Great way to put it.

Bitcoin is hardly a currency compared to Monero.

I’m a bigger crypto advocate than 90% of people... but these ads don’t do us any good. These Gemini ads are everywhere in NYC - on subways, on top of cabs, and on those animated billboard things you see on the sidewalk. In my opinion, it makes crypto look like a scam and a money grab. If cryptocurrency was truly useful and genuine, it would not need to heavily advertise to get people “invested.” I guarantee you the average non-crypto owning person sees these ads and gets turned off by the idea rather than get interested in it.

Alternatively, just use Monero.

Ever heard of Bitcoin Cash?

Bitcoin will die when the mass population realizes it is not a fungible currency. It is not good money. Monero will be the lone survivor.

You might want to research the term “network effect.” 
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:35:51
That's why you backup your seed.
@_date: 2018-07-02 18:05:28
That’s not how this works at all. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:37:23
Not Monero.

Bitcoin is actually fiat money. From Wikipedia:
"Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value that has been established as money, often by government regulation. Fiat money does not have use value, and has value only because a government maintains its value, or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value."

I just tried a transaction using the android wallet, paying for an article on mainnet.yalls.org. It was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had using cryptocurrency. This is the future. Wow!

That's debatable considering Ledger was hacked by a 15 year old.
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:11:25


This shouldn't have to be said. This is how people should accept Bitcoin by default.

Now you wait.

Is it less secure then? Or does it not really make a difference?
I guess my question is, if you had 10 million dollars worth of Bitcoin and had to store them all in one address, which address type would you choose?
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:19:14
A paper wallet doesn't have to actually be on paper. Just an encrypted text file containing your seed words stored in several different locations.
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:44:29
Is using segregated witness addresses more secure than legacy addresses?
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:39:03
Bitpay is horrendous. I think Roger Ver is involved. Any time you buy something with BitPay, it displays the BTC network fee as $0.17 and the BCH network fee as $0.00.

I had the exact same experience.

Why do the Bitcoin Cash people claim SegWit is less secure then? Is it just nonsense, or is there some truth to what they are saying?

Safe enough to use as your main wallet. Bitcoin Core is still the safest choice as always though.

This guide helped me the most.
All you have to do is run a full bitcoin node, download and make/compile clightning, and you should be good to go.
If you need any help with it, send me a PM and I can answer any questions you might have.

Then just sell the Bitcoin you receive as soon as you get it.

You can't send more than half of your BTC into a channel. So you will need at least 0.002 BTC in your Eclair wallet before you can open a channel with the minimum of 0.001 BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:38:07
That wasn't my question.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:56:55
Use Linux. Backup and encrypt your seed words and store them in several different locations. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:19:06
I'm getting the same issue.
Edit: I figured out the issue. It seems that you can't send more than half your total balance into a channel. So because the minimum is 1000 bits, you have to have at least 2000 bits in your account before you can open a channel. It's stupid.

Here are some of the benefits that bech32 addresses bring.

I agree. But I would choose paper wallets over a hardware wallet for cold storage any day.
