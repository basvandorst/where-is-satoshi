@_date: 2014-02-25 18:12:49
without the "27 page" document, he's a troll
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:51:22
also, I wrote that
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:55:56
cash out and leave us alone
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:13:18
this is great haha. Wow. what an exciting night :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:47:56
this video needs to be stickied on the side bar!!!
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:27:26
no proof. i got so excited :( 
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:46:37
you are an outlier, otherwise: why bitcoinbuilder.com?
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:49:08
ask yourself: who is anarchy5?
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:22:54
spoiler alert: there is no thief

we're all too busy F5ing
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:56:28
who the hell knows, but..! This is legitimately good news. I think they are/have been acquired. We'll see an announcement soon. Then TO THE MOON
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:11:39
I'm you
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:11:53
fiatleak is freaking me out :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:13:03
5 520. and wow
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:48:16
um, engrish much?
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:00:58
Thank you for your point. I agree that buying goxBTC is risky!! Very risky. And I think it's important that new bitcoiners understand risk.    
You english is good. Thank you for your contribution
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:58:19
we know ;p    
    
edit:   
1. have cash at mtgox already(!)    
2. buy btc at mtgox    
3. sell your goxBTC at bitcoinbuilder for realBTC    
4. sell your realBTC at stamp for cash
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:53:19
yeah, me too. But i keep hearing people talking about cheap btc at bitcoinbuilder and i think newbs need to understand what's going on. I also haven't seen a post explaining the ~1:1 path from goxBTC to fiat at stamp
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:24:46
no proof
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:02:54
I have bought a bunch of goxBTC. I don't personally think they will be insolvent. BUT, the sellers do, and they may have more information than I do. I am just trying to issue a PSA, a Public Service Announcement, a warning.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:51:01
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:05:07
not enough Magic The Gathering
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:24:33
i agree. it's trolling. we'll see in ~36 minutes.....
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:14:49
I'm still buying goxBTC too. we'll seeeeeee
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:55:01
it sucks for miners
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:55:02
do you even security?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:44:05
fiatleak uses exchange-provided data. Huobi has 0% fees, so the data can be manipulated, or so I understand. I've also heard that most of that traffic is on btcchina, so who the fuck knows?! :) this market is crazy yo
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:56:27
you are stupid
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:57:53
interesting!!    
the plot thickens
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:42:09
mtgox is not insolvent. It was managed badly, and it's been acquired. It's still being managed badly so far...
I expect good news soon.
You all are acting and commenting because of that META troll scribd document. The author is laughing all the way to his wallet, and you don't have to believe me. You'll see.
I'm still buying at bitcoinbuilder, as quickly as i can
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:13:07
there's a reddit link in there. click on "You were warned, and here's a reminder"
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:19:53
English is not your first language, and it shows. I don't understand your point
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:20:23
i agree. also look at fiatleak. it's been INSANE
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:53:31
it's gonna get crazy up in hea.
i predict solvency, followed by &gt;$2kusd/btc by april.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:50:25
[22:24:01] &lt;anarchy5&gt; do you guys want a courtesy 1 minute warning before i dump a huge amount?    
[22:24:11] &lt;brembo&gt; anarchy5: nah, just do it    
[22:24:14] &lt;DJSakamura&gt; Gox and probably RTBTC    
[22:24:25] &lt;pera&gt; anarchy5: please!    
[22:24:28] &lt;xoip&gt; it will bottom out at $5    
[22:24:34] &lt;brembo&gt; 4.85    
[22:24:35] &lt;d3p0rt3d&gt; 50% of profit earned for any heads up from anyone
[22:24:47] &lt;anarchy5&gt; consider it your 1 minute courtesy warning :)   
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:02:37
0% fees at huobi....they could be lying
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:28:55
you don't want anyone to deposit into your address? 419
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:39:03
worth watching
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:13:21
well there was that pdf on scribd, and all that other stuff, and things, and so much, it's like crazy. It's almost like we should just wait for actual news and stop the trolling speculation.    
but THE MAARKET yay
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:55:18
I have no evidence. I personally think they probably *are* solvent. But I don't know. And these trades, through bitcoinbuilder, are either from people who KNOW, or from very risk averse individuals
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:19:37
shut the fuck up
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:03:56
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:02:15
hi again asshole. I hate you. hit me back in a week and let's see
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:19:30
gox didn't lose 750k coins. don't be sheeple. that document was fake, and if you don't see it, sell
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:54:24
how many of us are there??
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:49:39
you posted your own ip in there........
