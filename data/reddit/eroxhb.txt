Coinbase does this alot. I paid 200 for coins on my debit card within a few days of joining and i got this message. 
I got my coins but they have since never let me use the service, though Im in not shape a criminal. Its just a stupid thing they will never remove :/

Bitcoin rules regardless and comparisons to businesses shouldn't really be made since Bitcoin and the crypto market in general is more similar to the Forex market (and the currencies / commodities traded)
You will always have an arguement in that convo mismatch to be honest

Once you've spent enough time with Bitcoin, it's pretty simple for a lot of users to analyse the price

That sucks mate, I personally have had a Kraken account for over a year and still haven't made a trade because each time I feel they have fixed their issues, someone else loses money with the service :/ GL getting support from them bro
