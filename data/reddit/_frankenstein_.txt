Okay, are they making an algo-trading strategy? 
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:56:03
That's very smart, insted of waiting for genetic algorithms to find the right way you ask already experienced people to make decisions then you analyze these decisions apply genetic algorithm "methods" (crossover, mutation, selection) and voila you have one of the best strategies. (For that moment as things might change pretty quickly at stock markets) 
@_date: 2016-08-12 09:47:25
Yeah... And it is clearly an alt account since people who speak about sensitive things often make another account so as not to make it possible for their friends or relatives to recognize them. So... There is no way this account should have won.

@_date: 2014-05-17 14:19:42
Let's see if my calculations were right... The price can't get anywhere down 100~165 dollars in that period of time. (My prediction, I can be wrong)
@_date: 2014-05-18 13:21:58
Now you can up vote...
@_date: 2014-05-17 17:36:11
The price is market cap divided by the number of bitcoins right?

How is this going to effect bitcoin price?

I think not even your grandchildren will be able to finish mining your 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-17 20:52:44
Yeah that's what I was talking about... And still, if everyone sells their bitcoins, marketcap won't be zero right?
@_date: 2014-09-22 15:27:04
So after you embed that miner's source code into your website, whoever visits your webpage starts to mine bitcoins for you?
@_date: 2014-09-22 15:54:48
That's genius!!!!
But I guess it would be a huge problem for e-reclaming sites such as adcash or even google.

Then, could you please explain how the hell things are going on? 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:31:18
I didn't get zero i.e bitcoin can't be completely inflated!
@_date: 2014-10-05 06:43:49
And what happens then?
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:28:03

I'll make another thread in the nearest future.

Didn't get that :(
@_date: 2014-05-18 13:13:25
In my post, I mathematically proved that MarketCap won't be zero, yeah it is kinda unusual, hard to believe but you can't argue with math. 
If you think that it will be zero and I am stupid, go ahead and prove it!
@_date: 2014-05-16 16:27:23
I thought it would be boring for most of you but if you really want... Of course I can!

Can we get the word list?
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:44:22
Or maybe he did not have a passport, I mean if I had mined 40K bitcoins in 2010 I would not be able to liquidate any of it because I would be sub 18 years old and even after 18 I probably would not feel ok with some shady companies having my private data.
Edit: looks like this guy invested more than half a million in bitcoin (not sure about this one) and had nearly 200K btc at some point in time sooooo, yeah he definitely had a passport and a pair of titanium balls.
@_date: 2016-06-18 11:27:49

Sometimes I think people steal ideas from my mind, It might seem a little idiotic but I once had an idea of creating a new coin, KarmaCoin which would use reddit upvote/downvote data and generate/reduce coins accordingly. But this was more of a shower thought than something I would really work on. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:35:43
Don`t worry you will be rich by um.. 2080.

The best thing about this bitcoin rise is that it happened over a long period of time which means that we aren`t dealing with a price bubble but rather with a pure increase in price. Of course hype has to do something with the recent increase but it is insignificant compared to the 2013 rise when Bitcoin was not ready for mass adoption. In fact, it is not ready even now but with introduction of segwit and more companies focusing on Bitcoin we are more prepared and I think we can sustain price above 900-1000 usd without a problem.

Trading and smart investments in other coins may bring you more than that, my investment has grown 6.5 times over the last year even though I bought my first bitcoin at 400$ usd and some later at 580$. 
But yeah trading is not for everyone. It is quite depressing actually.
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:29:40
There is something called "halvening" every 4 years block reward decreases 2 times, as of 2016 we are mining 12.5 coins per block and no until total number of coins hits 21 million mining won't be done.

Are you sure you can sell that for 700K?

But this is not a steam gift.
@_date: 2016-11-05 18:23:04
LoL, It seems you have problems with reading but it`s ok I will help you. The title says "CIVILIZATION® VI 6 | EU | STEAM | + GIFT" See? "plus GIFT" and right below the description the following is written:
"GIFT: 
********** 
Every customer who has purchased this product and leaves positive feedback can get a free bonus game on Steam. 
Key will need to be activated on "Steam". 
For a gift you must: 
1) Buy our game 
2) Leave a positive feedback with a comment "I want a gift" 
3) Contact us by email (Email displayed in contacts) or via chat. 
Gifts are normally sent out within 1-3 business days after writing a comment." 
THE GIFT IS A STEAM KEY! 
And how does this guy get the keys? Well if you take a look, the product you receive is "Civilization-VI-1_92.jpg" Which is a photo of a CD key of a retail version of the game.
I mean some of the people who trade at plati.ru are official dealers of major distributors, I mean take a look, this guy: [MoneoGold]( is an official dealer of [Noviy disk]( and [1C]( . On plati.ru people can buy keys directly from these companies which on the other hand are same kind of companies you buy games from (according to your about us page: "Our CD keys/licenses are bought from major distributors. Keys are scanned from their original retail boxes.") 
Look even the seller of Civ 6 is a VIP member, he has been selling stuff for 14 years! He has already sold 64575 items (worth a few million dollars) and only 9 of them have ever been refunded! 
Yes, there might be people who sell illegal stuff there but even then you can't just register at plati.ru and start selling stuff you have to provide identification documents passport, ID etc. And you can also get banned if you receive too much negative feedback or cheat. Heck, they even have right to hand the seller's private info to the police. But you know what? Just avoid these kind of people and you will be fine. 
I, myself have been buying stuff there for 4 years already and I have never encountered a single problem!  
There is no reason why people should buy stuff at your site and not at plati.ru, sellers are verified, sellers offer lower prices, sellers have more experience, sellers are regulated by admins and buyer's privacy is always protected all you need is an email to get your product. 
I don't know... Even the fact of not knowing what kind of platform plati.ru is (via which every single month, goods worth millions are traded) and the way you advertise sums up your "professionalism". 
I am done with you, people read people judge. 
@_date: 2016-11-10 19:24:45
Mama, just killed Put his words against his head,
Clicked my mouse, now he's banned.

So if you were to buy 10$ worth of btc in 2010 it would be worth more than 6.5 million USD now.

It worked out for that pizza guy...
@_date: 2015-11-05 06:00:27
I bought BTC at 480$, now I don't know how to feel.
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:29:47
Thanks Man! I think I will risk and buy some bitcoins. Where's the best place to buy relatively small amount of BTC. I think localbitcoins is the right place, not?
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:03:17
No problem. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 21:24:52
And once all of that was worth 200$.
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:50:06
Math checks out, it would take 293 days to drive price from 100$ to 500$ at this rate of +1.364% per day.

I am not sure about this one but, if your transaction is not confirmed then your coins still belong to your address, it is just your wallet that does not display them to avoid double spend.
