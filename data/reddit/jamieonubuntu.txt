Spondoolies SP50?

The software itself is very safe (unless you're running BU), but your IP will be much more visible than normal. This will make you a potential DoS target and could also draw attention to any other internet-facing applications that you have running on your home network.
Another thing to consider is the fact that people who are running nodes generally have a big interest in Bitcoin, meaning that they are more likely to own a large amount of Bitcoin. This could make you a target, very unlikely but worth considering.
If you're running your node from home, you should put the device in your router's DMZ. This way it will be isolated from the rest of your network. Depending on your router and network setup, it may still be behind the router's firewall.
It is possible to run a node through TOR or a VPN. That way you can have a fully functional node while masking your real IP.
You could also just leave port 8333 closed. Your node will still be able to make connections out to other nodes but you will not be accepting direct incoming connections. It would still be possible for somebody to find your IP like this, but it's going to be significantly more difficult. IPs are semi-public information anyway, you are probably leaking it all of the time without even realising.
Hope this helps!

Ok nice! It's definitely better that way, your node is going to be much more useful to the network if it is able to accept incoming connections.
Good luck!

Currently 106.7 GB. If you are low on space, you can run your node in pruning mode by specifying prune=amount in your bitcoin.conf.
For example, prune=16384 will prune to 16,384 blocks which is roughly 16 GB. The minimum amount for pruning is 550 blocks.
Are you using a Raspberry Pi?
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:16:16
Yes, it counts as a full node because it is relaying transactions. Make sure to open port 8333 so that it accepts incoming connections too.
The minimum pruning amount is 550 MB.

Ah ok, my mistake.

A hardware wallet would really help you with this.
Also, split your coins across multiple locations. Have 25% on an exchange, 25% on your computer and 50% on a hardware wallet?
Then even if your house burns down and explodes, you still have 25% of your coins saved online. Even better, store encrypted backups off-site so that you won't lose any of your coins!

Run the software that you support.

Can you tell us more about how you cracked the passphrase and what you tried with hypnosis?  
It sounds very interesting!

Great read, thanks for putting the time into such a long comment!  
It is lucky that you had the technical knowledge to solve the problem, many people would be completely stuck.

Especially when the first-level customer support agent has no concept of security or what social engineering is.
These major phone operations (transferring SIM to another device) should require at the very least physical proof of ID by going into the store.
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:37:08
It drives me mad when it is mandatory to have a phone number tied to your account as a "backup" for the time-based authenticator codes.
It just defeats the purpose of having an authenticator in the first place. If somebody wants to get in, they can still social engineer their way through your "backup" authentication method.

It doesn't run natively, but it runs well with WINE (a compatibility layer for Windows applications).
Check our for more information.

...and they cost $400.

I don't play League myself, but I would think that your 1070 would have no problem running League at 200+ fps.
Have a look at the [entry for League of Legends on the WineHQ AppDB]( That is where other users leave their feedback and tips for running Windows applications in WINE.

I bet countless people become interested in Bitcoin but give up when they see that they have to give their passport and a blood sample in order to buy from an exchange.

* Full control of your own money.
* Anonymity, privacy, security.
* The absolute confidence that your transaction can not be reversed.
* The ability to send money to anybody in the world without legal restrictions.
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:01:45
Yes, that is a good point.
I was talking more about a legitimate transaction that may appear suspicious. Like said, $4000 on Paypal is going to flag up and cause all sorts of problems. With Bitcoin, it wouldn't be an issue.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:34:47
Hmm, interesting. Do these exchanges allow you to purchase Bitcoin instantly using a Credit/Debit card?
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:59:28
Coinbase requires passport/ID verification for instant-buys though.
