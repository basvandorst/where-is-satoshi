honest question - how much wealth do you have?
i'm not considered wealthy by any stretch compared to the 1%, but i have no debt and a sizable savings account and investment portfolio.  i'm 35 with house &amp; kids.
i have my entire life built on the current system.  Why would I want to see that fail?  Why would anyone who has significant investments want to see that go away?  What benefit would I really gain by ditching a fiat system for a crypto?  
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:08:57
They don’t. We are taking $2 a day income level. The people making that sort of money, which is huge amount of people, do not save money. They use it to survive. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:45:00
You obviously have a good grip on this and I appreciate the info, but I still disagree with many of your points. Esp around inflation.  You see current inflation as an extraction, which is partially true, but it is also an investment in a reliable and stable economy. That has a lot of inherent value. 
Also no one should just be saving, regardless of currency. Hoarding is a real problem even with fiat. That won’t change with bitcoin and even right now the huge increase in price is from hoarding and a huge influx of speculators. This would cause major issues if there was no USD to trade bitcoin with. 
People need to invest. They shouldn’t save. Our economy should always favor and push spending money and investing.

I was referring to Iceland’s initiative to punish the banking industry. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:52:38
Yeah the lack of a dispute process for errors is a critical flaw 
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:43:57
Ok fair enough on having a bank statement, but do you have any evidence that a bank will even allow a crypto ledger as proof of income?  They’d have no way to get collateral so why would they even allow it?
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:47:26
Makes sense 
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:20:07
Perhaps. I can see loan sharks taking advantage
Honestly though I just see banks changing their policy. Their main goal is to store people’s money and make interest off it. The fees are icing on the cake
The banks may just remove fees and paperwork and allow easier mobile access to get people to use their services over crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:54:45
Not at the $2 a day level
It’s really silly to think these people need bitcoin. They deal in all cash and don’t have bank accounts. There is little practical need for them to require digital currency 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:22:11
i guess, but most people will be upset if there is any disruption.  
i still see no way for this to ever replace fiat.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:22:26
you can't expect bread to get cheaper just b/c the currency is deflationary in nature.  can't bitcoins just be separated anyways?  You don't need to buy a full bitcoin, and bitcoins can be split, cancelling out any effect of a coin becoming more expensive.
inflation and deflation doesn't just happen b/c there is more or less money in the system.  it is a complex myriad that involves jobs, housing costs, fuel, food, etc.   Crypto won't change any of that.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:35:58
If you think the massive influx is because people want a different currency rather than the influx being from speculators and investors who want to make a quick buck, then I don’t know what to tell you. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:03:32
i feel the fiat currency issue with bank bailouts is a political problem, not an inherit flaw to fiat currency in general.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:37:53
I’m not aware - I’m pretty sure they all require a network of computers 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:50:06
No, but can we 100% count on miners of the blockchain to not coordinate and corrupt the system?  If you are gonna throw hypotheticals out there
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:18:55
We are talking $2 income level. First off, the banks that serve those regions don’t have the regulations we face in the western world. The people who use these banks are making well more than $2 a day and are already connected to the world economy. 
Second off, The people in those economies that earn $2 a day don’t even have the means to save money.  They use almost all of their funds for survival 
What the fuck are they going to sell via bitcoin?  These people are selling goods locally, if they are selling anything at all. Most are farmers or Work in a factory. They earn a wage and have no goods to sell
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:53:14
Those people are earning well above $2 a day. 
That level of poverty still doesn’t have phones even if the areas where they live have service
Even then, most of those phones are voice only
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:05:27
that's a good step forward compared to the current model
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:23:54
Also if it gets sent to the wrong person there is no recourse. At least with banks you are insured and can open a dispute 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:48:02
how does crypto fix this problem though?  investments won't go away and inflation will still occur, just at the goods level i.e. bread now costs .2 crypto coin instead of .1
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:00:57
That’s debatable. What happened if they didn’t listen to the community?
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:48:34
Got it. It just doesn’t seem like that big of a flaw honestly. Most people invest to avoid inflation. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:52:00
Too speculative for my tastes. No one invests in bitcoin as a currency. People invest in it bc they see a quick buck to make. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:06:41
maybe with current volumes of trades.  multiply that by 100,000 or even 1 million if you want any shot at even replacing a medium sized country's system 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:05:08
increase the interest rate 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:19:33
people make honest mistakes all the time.  
you really think no way to dispute a charge is a step forward?
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:23:02
that disruption in service would be catastrophic.  the miners are needed for transactions.  i think that problem is already presenting itself today, even with limited volume. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:51:14
Most countries are in debt to each other. The debt clock is always a little jaded as it doesn’t include debts other countries owe us 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:34:46
I think most people would choose centralized 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:56:45
Yeah I can see it helping for abusive chargebacks, but many times the credit card companies are the ones eating those charges 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:48:42
more like make money by investing.  who lets cash sit and do nothing?  it is not a zero sum game 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:37:18
It’s very easy to cut off bank transfers for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:31:17
These poor people don’t even have phones or computers
How the fuck are they going to use bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:40:10
What a joke!
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:27:33
Currency supply is not the main variable for deflation. Sure, adding more bills can lead to inflation, but inflation will still occur in a crypto world whenever demand outpaces supply. In that situation bread would cost more. Bitcoin does nothing to solve that problem. 
Also regarding the Pizza analogy, that doesn’t really fit. The pizza will grow and shrink depending on the size of the economy.  Prices will adjust depending on demand, interest rates will change, and in the end we have the same effect as today
This doesn’t even touch the issue of governments willingly giving up their currency for no real world benefits. There is a lot of power behind the dollar and other world leading economies.  People trust in the system bc it works for almost everyone who has money in the bank. People like knowing their money is insured by their government. Why would people want to give that up?
Also why would people ever want to give up credit cards?  When I get shafted by a vendor I can dispute the charge. If my debit card gets stolen the bank gives me my money back. What does bitcoin do when I get shafted?  What happens when my house burns down and I lose my wallet bc I’m a moron and didn’t back it up?  That’s why people like banks. They remove the stupidity of the average citizen and offer protections bitcoin cannot provide. Any benefits offered by bitcoin in terms of inflation are completely wiped out by it not being a user friendly system that has protections for users and mistakes. It relies entirely on the vendor being honest. Fuck that noise. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:26:04
Most people don’t care how blockchain or the fiat system works. Who the fuck really cares about that?
Most People want a currency that is backed by Insurance, has ways to tell who sends you money and who you send money too, stable and backed by a government. 
This whole “the system is complex” nonsense is not even a problem for like 99% of the population 
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:22:02
Countries will always need to be in the mix. It makes no sense for one global currency to somehow do away with taxes and their own issued currency.  Esp at the superpower level. I’m honestly shocked people believe that a country-less currency will somehow totally replace government currency. Makes no sense esp when you talk about how taxes are not needed. Tell that to schools and road repairmen lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:27:54
Better than the controllers being random miners that could jump ship whenever they want. What happens to bitcoin if it crashes and miners shut down their operation for another coin?
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:14:05
Lol @ that goal haha 
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:36:21
Sorry man not at $2 a Day poverty level
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:38:22
Also, on another note, look at this shit show.  I find it hilarious that the only real recourse these people have is to use the US government to file a complaint 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:11:19
That’s assuming that people still will make the same amount of money, which is possible in a finite currency system.  If people start hoarding it could be even worse. 
This is all assuming only one crypto is used. How will that be possible seeing how many we already have?
How is using an alt coin that is accepted and mined on top of bitcoin any different than the gov increasing the money supply? The end result is basically the same - there are now more coins in the market to use as currency. 
Most people are fine with the gov playing the credit card game. It keeps a healthy rate of inflation. Other countries do the same and the US isn’t in as much debt as many make it out to seem. Plenty of countries owe us a shit ton of money. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:37:48
True enough. I just think the general population is not financially repressed as people make it out to be. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:40:34
I don’t think replacing fiat currency solves the kick the can forward problem. It actually does nothing to solve the issue of taxes and services. The kick the can down the road problem still exists even if the entire world used bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:31:42
I’m totally fine with it growing naturally. I just am totally against the idea of it somehow replacing fiat. That’s where I usually chime in. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:34:45
Seems like you can just get scammed on the other side. What happens when you have to pay upfront for something and you don’t get what you want?
Or if you accidentally copy the wrong vendor?  Opps I sent my money for this product to the vendor I payed yesterday for something different
These little mistakes will happen and if you have to rely on the vendor, that won’t end well. I like credit cards because they have my back. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:09:50
If people were all using cryptos the same problem would exist. People would just charge .2 bitcoin instead of .1 for bread, or whatever that conversion works out to be. Inflation will still happen it will just be on the goods end
Market crashes don’t happen as a symptom of fiat currency. Bitcoin doesn’t solve that problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:56:55
It would def slow down to a crawl. It already takes long enough right now and it’s red hot 
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:03:07
That will happen as the developing country produces goods and services that the world economy wants to consume
Digital currency doesn’t make that happen. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:24:56
tell that to iceland.  how is it not sound money?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:55:03
Seems like you are the one with the problem
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:43:44
Just shows the weakness of the market if it can be manipulated this easily 
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:10:29
Index funds for sure 
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:20:37
this esp changes once you have a significant amount of money.
for example i usually keep around 10k in my checking and always around 25k in my savings.  This pretty much gives me free everything, even ATM fees from other banks.  
I just use the savings as my emergency fund and then move any excess over to my investment portfolio 
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:59:52
Pretty much, ya 
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:19:56
Lol so how do you even live?  My guess is by using federal notes you initially used to invest and then sell for a profit?  So you are a normal speculator that invests money for a profit?  I mean bitcoin is like 1 way out of 10,000 to profit from investing. You kid yourself if you think you are somehow different from someone investing in the stock market 
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:23:35
I do understand. I asked those questions just to see what you would try and come up with 
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:17:19
Debatable at best esp how now people live longer and will need their houses for longer periods of time 
You really have no way to show that housing is at its peak
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:12:13
Where is the proof that it is faster and cheaper than credit transactions?  In addition where is the proof that the speed of credit card transactions is currently a major problem right now that needs replacement?  
The monetary policy may be predictable, but the value sure is shit isn’t, and that is important if you ever want a shot at becoming a real currency instead of just a speculative store of value 
Adapt and upgrade isn’t a solution?  WTF are you talking about?  So LN can’t be a solution based on your logic bc it’s an adaptive upgrade to the slow transaction network. You just totally made me LOL with that nonsense. Get the fuck out of here, come on man. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:26:39
Raw dollars lost is what really counts 
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:14:36
Except few transactions need to cross borders when compared to in country purchases, meaning there is no real need to replace the dollar due to transactional inefficiencies. Besides, the system can always become more efficient. You really think the bank system will sit back and allow BTC to take over bc international transactions are too slow?  They will just adapt and upgrade. Problem solved. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:45:00
It’s not a fight against the current system, it’s speculators trying to make an easy buck. 
Just the fact that everyone on here is talking about price as it’s some kind of investment vehicle proves my point. Very few people care about how they can use bitcoin as a currency. Most just care about the price and how much money they are making, or in this case, losing 
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:19:12
bank protections are much higher than bitcoin protections, at least in the present.
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:16:19
They were mostly sold due to back taxes. They skipped their bill for years and in some cases decades
It’s not unreasonable at all. Get those properties sold to people who are willing to pay taxes 
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:07:05
and there are many, many more who don't buy shit with it
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:08:02
That thing has been gone for like 40 years, get out of here what that shit. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:12:47
You were the one who didn’t even bother to answer
Get the fuck out of here with your shit, come on man
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:23:37
You don’t spend any fiat at all?
