I used the [blockchain.info iphone app]( on a jailbroken iphone to scan a QR code of the restaurant's public address and then typed in the amount to send.

We split 2 large bottles of Soporro for $4.50 each and a couple appetizers for $3.75 each. Total was $17 and change after tax, and we left a ~$5 tip, which brought it to $22 or 0.2132 BTC.
This place is pretty reasonable. Here is the menu:

When it was time to pay, I walked up to the register in the back instead of paying at the table. They had a laptop where they calculated the USD-&gt;BTC conversion using Simple Bitcoin Converter. I then sent the money using the blockchain.info app on my phone, and they saw the unconfirmed transaction pop up a few seconds later in the wallet on their laptop. Although it takes a while for the transaction to show up as "confirmed", seeing the unconfirmed transaction was good enough for them.

I've made real-life transactions at a couple places. The [sushi restaurant next door to our office]( takes bitcoin. There, I pay using the blockchain.info app on my phone and we don't wait around for a confirmation.
For lunch today, we ordered delivery through  They let you [deposit bitcoin]( into your account. They wait for 1 confirmation, and then you get an email that the money was added to your account similar to how gift cards work on their site ("Foodler credits")

It works out to be the same price. They use the Mt Gox rate to convert to USD when you send them bitcoins.

Brewster wrote a blog post about paying employees in bitcoin:

Sort of. I don't know how to use the tip bot. My last attempt was not successful. So i copied and pasted a line from the [documentation]( There are five examples listed in the example section. Only one of those examples has 'verify' in it, so that is the one I copied. It also happens to have the ฿ symbol in it.
Unfortunately, I think the bot is backlogged, or I messed up the syntax again...

Sure, but this is the first paycheck that went out as bitcoin so details might change in the future:
* A few weeks ago Brewster (the founder of archive.org) announced at a staff meeting that he wanted to try this experiment, and asked if anyone would be interested in participating. About a third of employees decided to have at least part of their pay in BTC.
* It is opt-in. No one has to receive pay in bitcoin if they don't want to
* If you want to be paid in bitcoin, you can choose what percentage of your paycheck you want in BTC
* I believe the paystub looks exactly the same as if you got paid in USD. The same taxes are withheld, etc.
* This is an experiment, and is a one-time only thing right now. So the next paycheck will be in USD. Maybe if everyone is happy with the experiment then we will do it again.
* We also have a [bitcoin ATM that works on the honor system]( in our office, so it makes it really easy and fast to convert between dollars and bitcoin. If anyone is unhappy with their choice to be paid in BTC, they can easily change it into dollars. Or if you wanted more BTC, you can just put some cash in the box and send yourself some coins from the "ATM".

We got delivery through  which lets you [use bitcoin]( to order at any of the restaurants listed on their site. The bitcoin part went really smooth. I think foodler hides all the payment details from the restaurant, so they don't even know that we used bitcoin to pay. The only disappointment was that not all restaurants deliver to our office, and some restaurants have a really high miminum order, so we had a couple false starts.
