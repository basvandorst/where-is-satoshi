I plus this, regarding china hitting crises 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:10:44
Even better.

I do agree that merchant adoption is critical. Well, across the world Square implemented buy/sell bitcoin so maybe soon they ll take it next level and allow sales in crypto...

Just do your own checks, or did you expect me to waste 30 min on screenshots? Wtf

Well all miners for example flooded HK and all seems fine for now. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:08:47
It s just the way it is. All so called 'chinese exchanges' are actually HK exchanges. I work closely with most of them.

The main idea is in what s written. Words, not design. We spend all time behind the scene, working. Some posts are news we deem as important, but many times there is knowledge you won't find anywhere. Up to you at the end of a day.

Make sure you don't fall asleep when the price starts dropping

Cool, but romania went even further. You can buy bitcoin in nearly every supermarket chain there is. Carrefour, Auchan, etc)))

Depends who moves the funds out faster)
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:17:01
Why not just move it to a standalone wallet that s not an exchange? Most standalone wallet companies have already issued statements that BTC will remain BTC

Unfortunately not. Although I personally think that Kaufland is miles in front in terms of other tech implementation 
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:32:41
Cool) generally speaking these machines have nothing to do with the actual chains as they just rent out space to the companies that set up bitcoin terminals, but still...) 
Btw, the shopping cart app is awesome, saves lots of time. Wonder if people steal stuff tho

Pretty solid amount of money if you ask me!  Then again, why didn't MtGox take security issue more seriously??? 
Why not make such file decentralised ?
