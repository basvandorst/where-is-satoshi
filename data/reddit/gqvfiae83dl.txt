I think you are confusing the different state and local taxes - property vs. income.
For property taxes, if they are ***assessed*** in 2017 and paid in 2017, there is a good argument that they are part of 2017 deductions.  For example, see here:    That is because even if they weren't due in 2017, and normally people would not prepay them, if they were in fact assessed in 2017, there is a decent argument they could be prepaid and apply against 2017 income.  And, see below where the property tax issue was left open in the tax bill.
You cannot prepay 2018 state and local ***income*** tax and use that to offset 2017 income.  Same link above expressly notes:


I am pretty sure that by the same token, 2017 state and local income taxes will be deductible against 2017 income, whether you paid them through estimated taxes or withholdings in 2017, or as part of your return by April 15, 2018 (subject to any normal penalties for underpayment of estimated taxes).  I couldn't find a link for this, but it is consistent with what Turbotax has done for ages.  While I have withholdings and pay estimated taxes during the taxable period, the estimated taxes paid for the prior year in January of the following year have always been deducted for the year they accrued, not the year they were actually paid.  Same with any amount paid when filing final taxes that apply to prior periods.
And, as for the countervailing factor, if you sell the first week of 2018, you may have to make estimated tax payments in 2018 - you don't automatically have a year to pay.  Although if the gains are not significant compared to your income and past year taxes, you may have no penalty or a minor one for underpayment of 2018 estimated taxes.

I read 2018 taxes as taxes accruing in calendar year 2018, return filed in April 2019.
It is not easy, so best of luck with whatever approach you take.

I think the distinction between our views is "accrual" vs "cash" accounting.
Income and expenses are generally based on "cash" accounting.  If you receive the payment in 2017, it is 2017 income or expenses.  It is hard to mess with this.
Income taxes, however, accrue during the applicable tax year.  IRS knows that you can't pay taxes instantly, however.  So the laws say, do your best to pick withholdings, and pay estimated taxes for taxes not subject to withholding, during the applicable tax year (lets say 2017.)  But they acknowledge there is a lag between when you can make those estimates.  Hence, estimated taxes are payable after the applicable quarter.  And, they acknowledge that in some cases, you don't have the info to make tax payments until much later.  So partnerships often don't even provide estimated K1s until Q1 in the following year, and final ones until Sep 15.
So many people literally can't finalize 2017 taxes until 2018.  Hence, the final estimated taxes for 2017 aren't due until Jan 15, and as long as you haven't significantly underpaid, you can still make 2017 tax payments as part of your April 15 return / extension, or even prior to Oct 15 extension deadline.
To the extent any of those withholdings, estimates or final payments relate to the 2017 tax year, I think they will qualify as deductible against 2017 income, and not subject to the new SALT limits that apply for the 2018 tax year.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:25:44
You can't file state and federal income taxes early and take advantage of prior year provisions.  2017 income is taxed based on 2017 rules, 2018 at 2018.
What is happening is people are trying to accelerate income / credits into 2017.  So a lot of people are pre-paying 2018 real estate taxes, as 2018 will limit how much of that is deductible.  But it is unclear if the IRS will accept that.
Or, some firms are accelerating bonuses that would normally be paid in 2018 into 2017.

Yes, but we are back to the chicken and egg thing...
How does Lightning get the traction with the currently limited universe of vendors who care about crypto, when they are now competing with many alts, who in the aggregate, can handle more than the current demand at low fees?
Beyond the general brilliance of bitcoin, the first mover advantage and network effects were a big part of what convinced me to buy bitcoin in 2013.  
Now it appears that for Lightning to succeed it needs that same first mover advantage and network effects.  But with the explosion of alts, it just doesn't seem to have either of those advantages compared to a combination of bitcoin 
"store of value" + the current first layer of alts.  
And if you talk about the second layer, then it is just as much in competition with alts who could likely add the same second layer (Ethereum / Raiden?), or more sophisticated and specialized ones based on their individual designs.
Which is why I'd love to see someone show me that Bitcoin + Lightning is cheaper / better in the aggregate than Bitcoin + low cost alt -- in the near term, **now** -- not once it reaches hypothetical scale.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:18:19
I understand that, I acknowledged that point in my third paragraph as mitigating the number of bitcoin to Lightning channel transactions.
My point is there is still at least one bitcoin fee transaction into Lightning, and back again.  So how is that different, from a fee perspective, from transferring to Litecoin, Ethereum or Monero, and using that lower fee / faster clearing currency for smaller purchases?
Hence my concern that Lightning is too little, too late, and faces substantial hurdles to building the scale where there are middle-men managing enough channels to make the thing work.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:25:21
Here is a question I've been struggling with.  
My understanding is that an individual user would still need to move bitcoin into a "channel" that is connected with the recipient.  Thus you may need to open multiple channels depending on what merchants do, which would require mutliple bitcoin transfer fees to get into those channels.
I think per your description above, the hope is that there are large channels linked with as many merchants as possible.  This means that the user would not have to move coin individually into the "Steam" or "Alpaca Sock Co." channel, but just once into a channel that is connected to both of those, and many others.
But the user still needs to move into at least one channel.  And in moving into and out of that channel, would the user still need to pay regular bitcoin fees for both of those transactions?
If so, I still wonder about the advantages of the Lightning network versus the evolving altcoin ecosystem.  I.e. if a user already holds alts with cheaper fees / faster processing, or knows how to easily exchange into them, what is the advantage of locking up money in the lightning network versus just doing the same with an alt.  It doesn't seem like there is a fee advantage in the first transfer, just potentially once you are in the channel.
Yes, if massive channels develop with scale, then it could be easier and cheaper to use Lightning versus an alt.  But then you have the chicken and egg thing of those networks developing if there are already alternatives.
And I guess one advantage is the bitcoin are in the lightning channel are still denominated in bitcoin, so there is no separate alt volatility.  But then again, volatility has been so crazy lately across bitcoin and all alts that a lot of people are kind of numb to it.
FWIW, I am not trying to be negative or speak in favor of big blocks.  I see the value of bitcoin increasingly as a decentralized store of value, where if you need to transact without interference, you can.  And I think that outweighs high fees, and hope segwit adoption and lightning emerge to help lower fees.
But I still wonder if Lightning may still face significant headwinds to attain scale given the rapid evolution of alts.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:49:51
I understand that.  My question was, using your analogy, how is the Lightning "credit card" going to gain the scale it needs to be dominant given the many other crypto "credit cards" that can accomplish the same thing...  
And are there any fee advantages in using the bitcoin to lightning "credit card" versus the bitcoin cash, litecoin, ethereum, monero, etc. cards.

These futures are cash settled.  That means that if you sell a future, you are not obligated to deliver bitcoin at expiration, but just to deliver the cash difference from the price at which you sold the future.
Cash settlement does not mean the seller is unhedged.  In many future markets, most participants are not taking pure directional bets (the asset will go up or down), but more complex arbitrage trades.
So if that seller hedges their risk that bitcoin will rise by buying actual bitcoin on other exchanges, then yes, the purchase of a long bitcoin future by an institutional investor does result in a new money coming into bitcoin through the seller of the future buying bitcoin (or buying another bitcoin future or derivative, pushing the ultimate purchase to another party).
Of course, the same thing works in the other direction, so it is unclear what the net impact will be.
I think where some people get worked up is that in other commodity markets, like gold, the amount of futures, options, derivatives, etc. may vastly exceed the supply of the underlying asset.  So  in that case, it may be that the "tail wags the dog".  But I think we are a long way from that happening for bitcoin, and the side effect of getting to that potentially problematic situation is probably huge increases in the price...

If he was a miner, the mining income could be taxed as income at the time received (at least in the US).

Not a Ver fan, but why do you object to someone renouncing US citizenship, whether to "avoid" taxes, or for any other reason?
First, the US is one of only two countries (other is Liberia) to tax worldwide income... among other things in the US tax code one could reasonably object to.  Why shouldn't one be able to renounce US citizenship and choose another state, whether for taxes or other reasons?
Second, when you renounce US citizenship, you may actually pay a lot of taxes.  For example, normally you don't pay capital gains taxes until you realize the gain.  If you renounce citizenship, you pay taxes as if you had liquidated all assets.  It can be quite a huge tax hit, and whether that is better in the long term depends on future performance as well as whatever tax jurisdiction you wind up in.

Correct on $3k limit against income, but individuals can carry forward capital losses indefinitely, and use them to offset future capital gains dollar for dollar.
So if you had $100k loss in 2017, you could use $3k against 2017 ordinary income, and carry forward $97k.  If you then have $50k gains in 2018, you could fully offset those 2018 gains with the 2017 loss carryforward, use $3k against 2018 ordinary income, and then you still have a $44k capital loss that carries forward into future years.
The timing problem is that you can't offset past gains with future losses in a different tax year.
So if you had a $100k gain in January of 2017 and then a $200k loss later in 2017, you would have a net capital loss of $100k in 2017, $3k of which you could offset against income, and the remaining $97k carries forward.
But if you had a $100k gain in 2017, you owe taxes in 2017 on the full amount.  If you then had a $200k loss in 2018, you can't use that loss to reduce your past payments.  So you wind up with a $100k gain that is taxable in 2017, and a $200k loss in 2018, of which you can use $3k against income, and carry forward the $197k loss into future years.
This is the scenario that causes trouble with traders who don't understand the rules.  I've seen it a couple times in the bitcoin world, but also with amateur day traders of more traditional securities.  
The wise thing to do is to always hold back your estimated tax liability any time you book a gain and not trade with it (and in most circumstances, you actually have to pay quarterly estimated taxes anyway.)
@_date: 2018-11-03 21:07:00
Or just do what more professional traders do.  Any time you book a gain, hold that money separate from your trading account and pay your quarterly estimated taxes.  If you use the taxable amount to trade, you are basically trading with money you are "borrowing" from the IRS, and the IRS is very good at collecting its debts.

Correct.  And the $3k is only the offset against income, not against capital gains.
Make $4k cap gains and $4k cap losses in the same year, no cap gains.
Make $4k cap losses in 2017, and $4k cap gains in 2018, no cap gains, full offset.
Where people get hurt is losses don't look back.  Make $4k cap gains in 2017, and $4k cap losses in 2018 - pay taxes in 2017.  If you later have cap gains in 2018, you can fully offset.  But if you don't, you are limited to $3k offset against income.
And the offset is dollar for dollar, not just the taxable portion.  I.e. one dollar of cap losses offsets the taxes on one dollar of cap gains.
Further, poster above had no income, so their cap gains rate is 0%.

I think I understand the concept.  During the high fee periods, the costs for consolidating, managing and eventually liquidating internal transactions went up.  In your original model, these were very low and were covered by your % fee.  So you were faced with either increasing your merchant % fee (which would have partially reduced demand, but also rationally result in at least some of that hike to the consumer), or essentially creating this new fee that was intended to reflect your actual costs, and would adjust to future fee market conditions.
However, as with many such "pass through fees" (most egregiously illustrated by Ticketmaster add-on fees), they rapidly become their own source of profit, and it sounds like that is one concern some people may have here:
So a couple of questions in that vein:
1 - If this is just to consolidate the payments on your side, why do you use fees required for two block inclusion?  You already have received the bitcoin from the purchaser, so you know you can transmit fiat to the seller.  What is the rush to consolidate on your end?
2 - Similar to above, can you not also wait and use batch transactions for multiple transactions to further reduce fees?
I realize 1 and 2 above would require some degree of market risk if you are converting the bitcoin received to cash, but I still would guess that you don't do that instantly for every single transaction and somehow are already managing working capital and fx risk.
3 - Do you support segwit, and are the fees less for those transactions, do you charge customers less for segwith transactions?
4 - You note that these fees are no different than those parties receiving bitcoin directly would eventually have to manage.  So why choose to have that entire incremental fee charged to the purchaser?
Thanks in advance.

The problem is that for many larger bitcoin investors, this does not reduce the recordkeeping burden, just means less transactions to report to IRS.
For the comparable small foreign currency transactions, users are those who convert a couple hundred dollars before travelling to spend while travelling... For a single trip.  Then, next trip, you do the same.  There is limited record keeping for each transaction (unlike with the blockchain, or the records of Coinbase that are currently subject to a subpoena.)
But for crypto investors who have made larger investments (or smaller investments much earlier, that are now worth more), you still need to record your basis and dispositions in case you make a larger sale.
I.e. suppose you bought 20 bitcoin in 2013 at average basis of $100, and 20 in 2014 at average basis of $500.  You "spend" 10 in individual transactions of less than $600 in 2018 - so no tax hit or reporting.  But then you sell 20 to make a mortgage downpayment.  That is above the exemption level, so you have to pay taxes.  To do that, you have to figure out the basis of the coins you sold.  Using FIFO (first in, first out), 10 of those bitcoin have a basis of $100, and 10 have a basis of $200.
So you still need to keep records of your non-taxable transaction to ensure the taxable ones are accurate.
Still, would be better than the current situation for many people.

My comment B had nothing to do with potential liability, but with the process.
The US has largely upheld similar terms that preclude class action suits, and require arbitration.
This means potential coinbase plaintiffs can't go to courts or join classes - well, they can try, but will probably lose on the class certification before anyone gets to substantive issues.
Then, each plaintiff will have to go to arbitration, each bearing their own costs. 
That dynamic greatly shifts leverage to Coinbase, vs class actions where thousands of plaintiffs can share costs and leverage.
And without going too much in to the substantive issues - if you are concerned about what Coinbase is going to do, why not withdraw your coin?  I would bet that is one of the first questions an arbitrator asks you.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:00:39
A - How many times in crypto have you seen threats of class action or other suits that haven't panned out?  The fact is the industry is still in its infancy, and what paranoid people think are conspiracies are often businesses figuring things out as they go along.  I mean Bitfinex came up with their haircut / token approach to the hack, neither of which have clear legal support, and I haven't seen any meaningful lawsuits appear based on that.  Nor have I seen anyone sue Coinbase over their bitcoin cash actions / plans.
Also, I think anyone who has a strong opinion on Segwit2x, pro or con, also understands the only way to ensure you get both coins is to take bitcoin off an exchange.  And coinbase pointed that out clearly before the bitcoin cash fork.  So if you decide to leave your bitcoin with coinbase, it is because you trust them to pick the right chain and maintain it securely, and maybe if both survive, you might be able to sell them in the future.  Hard to claim damages if you later decide you would have been better off taking your coin off coinbase, as they warned.
B - Coinbase ToS have customers agree to binding arbitration and waive class action suits, which is generally enforceable in the US.
C - Per the comment about how "businesses stay quiet of they're planning something users won't like", businesses also stay quiet when they are still evaluating what is going to happen and what they are going to do.

Same way you do with a cash business.
Demand business records, including bitcoin records.  Do typical forensic accounting looking at customers and vendors and market.  Look at physical assets owned by the business and the owner of the business.  Interview employees who can themselves become liable if they perjure themselves.  If things don't add up, prosecute.
People have been trying to hide money from the government, their spouses (divorce), their business partners, etc. for centuries.  Bitcoin, and even more anonymous currencies like Monero, are just one more tool.  Traditional "gum shoe" forensic work is the way most criminals get busted, and crypto doesn't really change human fallibility.

I think they didn't prosecute because after the DAO hack and rollback, there were no gains by the DAO promoters.  No point in prosecuting if you can't get the easy hangings of disgorgement.
See, e.g., Satoshidice:  
But with the precedent, they can now go after the recent ICOs that raised even more than the DAO.  They can also go after the exchanges that trade them in the US (e.g. Poloniex).

Exactly.  Cash and Gold are as anonymous as bitcoin, and countries enforced taxes when those were the only currencies.
Honest businesses need to keep accurate financial records for many reasons other than taxation (financial planning, for shareholders and lenders, etc.).  Taxes are paid accordingly.
Dishonest businesses may try and falsify their records, or keep two sets of records.  Even if they just use cash, they still get audited and busted all the time.
