Honestly I'm a fan of anonymity and all, but this seems shitty. Paying for five transactions just to make only one true? Any half decent blockchain analysis tool will skip the one to one transactions and use a dynamic depth analysis.
I'm a much bigger fan of the zerolink project, a trustless payment batching solution that make it very difficult to trace back your coin deeply *and* reduces fee significantly.
Adding hops doesn't make it harder to trace back the coin but adding another hundred output at each step makes the difficulty exponential.

It's a very interesting and realistic idea. You could open a tor route to a gateway by buying your right of passage with lightning while maintaining anonymity.

That's not exactly how it works.
Your node is indeed a hot wallet, which means that your private key need to be known at all time for it to receive, send and route payments,
Only your node know the key and must accept each operation by signing it.
While this mean that your node can be attacked at all time, you are still the only one in controle of the private key.
Maybe it could be possible to write a special funding transaction that need to be signed only  by the side that pay money, but you still need to be up for routing and for recording the state of your channel.

A PoW will always, by definition, waste resources. Whatever action you declare to be a PoW will tend to cost the same amount than what it produces directly (nothing in case of bitcoin) plus the value of the coin mined.
If you design a PoW that produces additional revenue like heating, people will just subtract the economy they make from said heating and will continue increasing their hash power until they reach again the point before they are not profitable anymore.

Yes of course, what I meant to say is that sharing your private key is never part of the protocol.

First it depends on your definition of efficient, if you consider TX per seconds or storage space, it sucks, but that's not what a blockchain aims to do, it aims at decentralization and immutability, and it is the most efficient system  (arguably the only one) at doing this.

1) yes, all lightning specs are defined in BOLT documents, that are like JSR for Java. They are defined by a sort of consensus between all the actors that agree to implement it for the best interoperability.

As I said, the problem is not that they didn't have a practical way of monitoring their department spending or whatever. They could create replicated databases all across the world, they could give crypto keys for every single agent, but they won't because they don't want their transactions to be monitored and traceable, they don't want to be accountable.
If any government tried to create a database that each government agent had to use, they would just ignore it, falsify their entry and ultimately go on strike  or use whatever power they hold to stop it. It will not happen

All channels need to be funded. That means that moving 1btc through 5 channels actually update the balance of 1 btc in each channel, that is, at least 5 btc as fund are required in total.
But it's not that bad, since now 5 btc are available for transactions in the other way. Ultimately a node could propose negative fee for rebalancing channels or at least some arbitrage would be profitable on the network.

Miners are also nodes, they receive and relay all transactions. They build a block from the latest block they have using the current transactions in the mempool.
They try to make this block valid by trying to find the correct hash for it. Once it is done they relay the block to the other nodes and miners.
When they receive a block they validate it against their memepool. If it is correct, they update their state and try to mine a new block on top of it. If they have an invalid block, they ignore it. If they have competing block (valid themselves but mutually invalid together), they take the one with the most accumulated proof of work.

You can put high fee on the spot to be included in the next block, but you can't predict how much it will be (30 or 40$ should be enough for a normal transaction).
Theorically, you could open a lightning channel with your buyer, fund it, make a lightning payment on the spot, and clear the channel to commit the transaction afterwards when it cannot be double spent.

Firstly, all transactions received on the same address are de facto linked together, which greatly reduce your anonymity, and those of anyone who sent you money. 
Secondly, in order to move funds, you need to reveal the public key of the address, while only its hashes is known before. This is not a real problem for now but it would make the task really simpler for a quantum computer to crack your key.

I was pretty tired when I wrote this. It was the first use case that came to mind for an object that would require intensive use of micro transaction.

it's an empty block. When a miner know a block have been mined, and before he has built a new block over it, he mines an empty block that is always valid. sometimes he finds the pow for this block, but it only  costs the network the time to propagate a new block. It's irrelevant to transaction/s as long as the propagation time for miners (who have a good network speed) is order of magnitude under 10mn

increasing the efficiency of mining is pointless, the whole purpose of the POW is to waste resources. If you increase the hashrate, you will only make the difficulty readjust, people will shift to the new method until the network consume near as much as the miner reward, at which point entering and exiting miner will balance, and back to step one. 
the only purpose of discovering better hashing method is to prevent an adverse agent to takeover the network by coming with a vastly greater hashrate than all the network before. For example, without ASICs, government could have used super calculator to destroy bitcoin, now that ASICs are here, their hashrate dwarf the combined power of all super calculator.

it's the emitter responsability to set the fees, so ask how your service is handling fees. ideally they should make bundled transaction a few time a week or month when the transaction fees are the lower, less than a Satoshi per byte.

CME allows people to protect against the fluctuation of price by contracting a buy/sell price in a future date.
This is good for businesses that treat in bitcoin but don't want to lose money if bitcoin go down, in exchange they lose the opportunity to gain if it goes up. Basically it split a bitcoin payment in two parts : the safe fixed price and the unknown variable delta price.
This is good, because it allows people that want payment without risk and people that want risk without leveraging too much money to be satisfied both.

But then his insurance would step up and protect him from unjust retribution, which then would either degenerate in full blown war (not viable so it would be extremely rare) or they would rather negociate between them for the settlement.
If you find this dubious it's probably due to my poor explanations. Just think about how car insurances works, its very similar to this and people don't crash into other people cars all the time.
Just as a side note, if you think it would be discriminating against poor people/give too much power to rich people, just think about how the lawyer you can afford can make a difference now, or how much money you can put on the table can make thing in the way you want.

A wallet is based on a passphrase, usually a 12 to 24 string of words, you can generate one with almost any wallet app. This passphrase, also known as a seed is the key component of your wallet. You must never show it to anyone and you must back it up securely.
All the technical adresses used to view your fund, receive payments and send funds are derived by the wallet from your seed.
Usually you have one master view key that allows to see all your fund, you should not share it with anyone.
You have a private key that is equivalent to your seed, you must never share it or even display it.
You have an almost infinite number of receiving adresses, each one can be used as many time as you wish, but you should not give an address from which you have already spent coins.

You need to understand first how bitcoin transfer works in general, then you need to setup a wallet and send him your paiement address. That is if you want to send/receive/hold bitcoin like anyone.

That would be pointless. The energy burnt in mining is equivalent to the value of the mining reward. Any method of mining will tend to consume as much resource as it can until it is no longer profitable enough to do so. It would just move the cost from what we see (electricity and chips manufacture) to what we don't see as much (space storage manufacture and maintenance). Ultimately the same wealth or human labor will be used to secure the blockchain, whatever the proof of work is. 
At least with asic the entry cost of operating one is low enough that most people could do it, and the entry cost of creating one is high enough that we don't see opportunist attack (how do you think a supercomputer or an AWS super cluster would fare on a cryptonote blockchain?)

For fucks sake, this type of post get reposted again and again... There is a clear technical explanation available by googling!
Empty blocks are mined during the time required for a miner to build a new block after receiving one. Miners can't just stop mining for 20s so they mine the only block they are sure is valid : an empty one. It's perfectly normal for miner to optimize the hardware they have in such way.

@_date: 2018-04-06 07:40:34
How I did it :
Startup any Linux distribution from USB or whatever, use pgp to encrypt your seed file and use a strong password that you are sure to never forget, no need to use a too new or complicated one, remembering is the most important here.
Burn your encrypted file on 3 or 4 CD-R, store them in their boxes. I also included instruction to decrypt the file on it.
Give CD to your heir/trusted people to store at their houses with instruction to contact you if lost/stolen. 
Tell the password to someone you trust but don't give him the CD.
This way you create a 2 factor security with a physical object and and secret passphrase.
It's cheap, durable, fire resistant, recoverable in case of death but not so easy that anyone wanting to steal from you could in a heartbeat.
Of course it has flaws but I'm not fort Knox...

First, a hardware wallet like ledger is not a cold storage. a cold storage is a computer or a paper that is disconnected entirely from any network.
We deal in hypothesis, but any private key that work at some point should allow you to retrieve your coins in any future version, if a non-retro-compatible version was made it would basically be another currency.
That being said, it is probable that at some point of the future you would be required to make an upgrade to be able to use again your coin. But remember, what is holding your coins is *not* your hardware wallet, it's your private key, in this case it is your seed, if you have your seed, you should be good.
Also, I don't know the kind of memory that the ledger uses, but a usb stick has a data retention between a few years to fifteen years, so if you plan to keep your ledger in a safe for a decade, it is fairly possible that it will not work properly after so long.

The trezor is here to give you access securely to your bitcoins, you need to have access to it to be able to spend it ! The only thing that you should secure is your seed, be aware that safe deposit is not protected against the bank itself (they could check the seed, use it and say they never did anything), and from the government. Personally I would recommend to encrypt it and keep it in different physical location, or making password paper wallets.

1 : bitcoin is still in an adoption phase, additionnally it's usability for direct payment is not really good considering the transaction time. I hope the problem will be solved soon. once its purchasing capacity is secured, its price will rise steadily until full market adoption.
2: same as first, when bitcoin will have a more massive adoption, the price will be way more stable. I don't think bitcoin is manipulated, it's just that it have a peculiar community of user spread between long term holder/newcoming that are not following the price closely and doesn't search to maximize their entre/exit point, and speculator that withdraw as soon as the price drop and reenter just after. these two population doesn't use bitcoin in the same way and they create important fluctuation, but in the end bitcoin is rising and gaining adopters.
3: I guess an increased complexity could be a source of abuse, but with time these problems will be resolved.

well, firstly if you had several bitcoins you can imagine what is it worth today.
do you posses the physical hard drive where you had installed you're wallet ? did you made any backup of the private key ?
if you have the drive, and that you didn't reformat it, you could probably recover them easily. if you have reformatted it, you can still have hope.
if you don't have the drive and don't have any backup, it's probably lost (for you)

Secondly, they can't create money. Sure they could release a non negligible amount of bitcoin once it is very valued, making the price drop, but it's their only shot, they can't inflate the money supply infitely like central banks.

@_date: 2017-05-16 13:13:33
when establishing security protocol, a good practice is to assume that the protocol of security is perfectly known from the attacker.
Also for securing your seed you should consider the fact that you need to protect yourself against accidental destruction of your data (fire in your house, account and data deleted, bank robed, etc.)
what I did for my seed is encrypting it with aes-256 on a nano computer without wifi, using a strong, well known to me, never used password, then I copied this file on some CD-R that I kept and gave to a couple of family members. you could also keep a copy of it on a quite safe online backup. You should communicate your password orally to your heir in case of death.
considering the ledger, I keep the pin to me, assuming that you cannot access it without. If you lose your ledger (and are not sure that it has been destroyed) you should move to a new seed just in case.

Considering each position is encoded into 3 characters, this makes a 4 position seed, adding the fact that people would probably choose among a relatively reduced set of position constituted of the nearest and most recognizable, I would say the strength of this seed pretty weak. 
That being said, remembering your seed is not very useful since that mean that if you die, the coins are irredeemably lost. I think it would be better to store your seed encrypted on a cold computer, written on 2 or 3 CDs and having only one or two "heir" learning the password by head.

a hardware wallet could be hacked if : 
- a malware gain access to the private key inside, but it's very very unlikely to happen since they communicate with a specific protocol that does not allow a hardware wallet to ever release this kind of information.
- the company that produces it release a virus inside the software of the hardware wallet that create a backdoor. this is kind of unlikely since you still would have to commit the backdoor publicly on the open source code, then it would have to pass into production and you would have to make the update, then use it. by the time the hack would be known, very few people would have made the upgrade and the company would be dead.
hardware wallets are I think the best security/low entry tool for holding bitcoins by far.
your solution for holding bitcoins are :
-  paper wallet (with password), quite easy to setup, medium usability, mixed security
-  phone wallet, easy to setup, easy to use, low security
-  hardware wallet, easy to setup quite easy to use, good security
-  cold storage, hard to setup, hard to use, excellent security (if done well)
-  exchange wallet, easy to setup, very easy to use, medium secure IF you trust the exchanges 
-  online vault service (with or without multisignature) : easy to setup and use, medium secure IF you trust the exchanges
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:05:34
if you use all the alphabet, low and higher case, numbers and special symbols, each character of the password is chosen among ~90 characters. If your password has been generated randomly and has to be brute force, this mean around 2^130 combinations.
this chart shows that cracking such password is thoroughly impossible for now, even a quantum computer with enough qubits would still need 2^65 tries.

Selling and then buying back cheaper is extremely risky and difficult. If the demand is there, you could just end up selling to all the current offers, and then when trying to buy back make the price go up way more. You have to sell at a time when more people will want to sell once it's down than before, which only exists on speculative markets.

no, because the sell price is 10$, and there is 100B coins in existence, this make the market cap to 1 trillion dollar. you can see the market cap on  and especially the "circulating supply" with a little Asterisk indicates a premined currency.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:27:57
securing your seed using the private key derived from it is a bad idea...
On a general basis, you always need to have a backup login plan when using two factor authentication. (one use code, sms or hardware wallet in addition to phone authenticator)
For my seed I choose to encrypt it with aes 256 on a cold computer and burn the file on a few CD-R that I dispatched to some of my relatives' house.
this way my hardware wallet is used to make transactions when needed and only me know the pin, and if I need to restore it I can open my CD and decrypt it on my cold computer to reset the hardware wallet.
The CD itself is not enough to steal the seed but a resourceful enough pirate could break the password eventually, that's why I don't store it online, this way I will probably know if the CD is stolen.
be sure to choose a password you are absolutely certain to remember, never write down the password and ideally never use it elsewhere. You should give the password to someone you trust in case of death or amnesia.

Not absolutely sure, but if the password was optionnal, it would not really have any purpose... 15 character is too much for basic brute force, except if he put some garbage password... the best he can do is self enginner his password... if he can remember the type of thing he could have set as password he may try it or variation of it.

A good rule of thumb is to never endanger your finances, you should start with the principle that the money you invest can be lost totally and that you would still be fine.
once this is understood, you have two strategy : 
- if you think it will rise globally in the coming month, then invest all you want right now, then invest what you want when you have the money.
- if you are not sure whether it will go up or down in the coming month, but still think that it will be a gain in the long term (years) do a *dollar cost average*, that is, invest a fixed sum regularly.

If your refer to the amount of bitcoin you have purchased (the one that appears in your balance) they may not even be real bitcoins, they are just a balance and a promise from coinbase to transfer up to this amount should you require it. it's basically the equivalent of a bank account.
They also have a service called vault that provide a private key and an interface to make transfer from it, they have access to the private key but the bitcoins are actually credited on this address. It's the equivalent of having money physically in a safe at the bank.

if a country really wants to have bitcoin as currency, it should authorize any usage of bitcoin on its territory for payment, remove any legal barriere or tax on bitcoin, accept bitcoin as payment for all his gov. "services" and "fee", and lets the market do its magic.

Having two opposite goals is not a problem, this is the basis of economy. Every company want to sell higher and every customer lower. The problem is that the most effective tool for miners to rise fees is code limitation. Just like companies lobby gov. to enact quotas and licenses, they use the current limitation of the block chain. Once the number of transaction will be raised, they will be forced to compete between each other for fees.

Thank you for the input, it seems that I do have been imprecise, by mixing up total supply and circulating supply, but the point remains that premined coins can easily be artificially exchanged to simulate an activity and that the fact that a single company posses the majority of the coins to ever exist is very suspect.

advice you will get a lot here : don't buy ripple.
of course it's your money, do as you please, but you should know that premined coin are worthless.
basically their market cap means nothing. they create billions of coins, release a few thousand in circulation, they buy some themselves to start the business, and now, the real capitalization is maybe 1M coin circulating * 0.10$ = 100K$, but the market cap is 100B * 0.10$ = 10B$ and everyone think it's a lot, but if they were to actually release the coins the value of it would be diluted to nothing.
if you want to invest in scam coins you should find exchanges that accept to deal with it.
But you should read more about crypto currencies before buying some, especially alt-coins. this place is a good start.

quantum cryptography is totally different from post-quantum cryptography. the first as described in the article is the use of quantum physic properties to encrypt data, while post-quantum cryptography is the use of conventional algorithm to encrypt in a way that makes the data safe even with quantum computer.
for example the RSA algorithm used to encrypt with private/public key is not resistant to quantum means, but the aes 256 only become easier by halving its exponential difficulty.
AFAIK quantum cryptography is very tricky because its very principle that protect it from eavesdropping make it very vulnerable to communication noise, which make it either slow or impossible on fiber network at most.

based on  I would say that vault is a separate wallet, but on their basic feature, they keep the private key with them, so they can access the coin if they want (or if gov. forces them) without your consent. On their multisig signature they allow you to add other private keys that are needed additionnally to move funds, this feature theorically stop them from using the funds (they could still intercept your private key when you use it and stole it to you).
so, to answer your question, theorically the coins are lost if you delete your vault. in practice they would probably keep the private key somewhere to access the funds instead of losing it forever (that's what I would do).
that being said, in both case your are depending on coinbase to allow you to withdraw your funds, that is if the gov. command them to block your account you will be stuck.

why is bitcoin deflationary ? its stock is not decreasing (except bitcoin rotting, but it's very negligeable). It is not deflationary, it's just that its quantity does not increase, so the fact its value rise is caused by the greater aboundance of goods to buy ! if everyone hoard his bitcoins and wait for money, it's price will not go up !
I find this king of question very amusing, because IMO, the only reason why people keep asking it it's that they are so accustomed to being robed by their central banks (and gov.) that they consider the fact that having a money that doesn't lose its value as non-natural.

I think taking a loan is perfectly acceptable, as long as you can always repay it.
Envision worst case scenario, for example loosing job or bitcoin crash, if you can still pay your loan, then you can take it without being irresponsible.
But be warned, it's a risky investment and it could cost you a few years of work to make up for the loss. or it could allow you to earn 20 year of work...
generally in the current context, if you're pretty sure you will not lose your job (you work in a very long trend demanded job, or your company is very unlikely to close or fire you) you should be good in taking a loan, the rate a very low, and will probably be below the inflation by the time you will repay your loans...

you should have some lecture about bitcoin and the blockchain 
To be fast, you could store your seed on a CD-R (mini 100 year storage) or an encrypted paper wallet.
Your bitcoin balance is calculated by agregating all the transactions that credit your receiving adresses, these transactions are hosted on nodes all around the planet by individuals.
The private key allows you to generate receiving adresses and sign transactions, with the private key you can transfer the bitcoins to another receiving adress, and that's how you spend bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:44:04
the only thing that count for a miner is the space your transaction is taking on the block. A segwit transaction does not includes its signature in the block, therefore being lighter than the total weight of the transaction. 
I think the formula is mostly for setting the correct fee for your segwit transaction (ie, not paying for the witness data uselessly). 
Concerning incentives, miners will continue to mine the most profitable transaction, whatever it is inside.

1: you cannot make fake coin, you can only make believe your users that you have the coins.
2: exchanges who want to live more than a few month have no incentive to cheat their users. if they don't buy/sell bitcoin at the same time that their users, they are just shorting them, sometime they will lose, sometime they will win, but it's risky.
3: it's near impossible to manipulate the market. When you buy massively (fictitiously or in reality, whatever) you incentive people to sell their bitcoins, the price go up, but then if you try to sell you will deflate your own bubble, it's near impossible to create a momentum bigger than your initial investment.

Beyond the point that current money has nothing intrinsically or historically bettter than bitcoin or gold, actually some serious economists think that deflation is not a bad thing per se.
What happend is that some thing that a regarded as bad (like a drop in consumption) cause deflation, while some things that are regarded as good (like an increase in production/decrease in cost of production) also cause deflation.
concerning bitcoin, the cause of deflationwould not be reduced consuption, but increasing production relative to the quantity of money, and this is nothing to fear. Actually it is even a good thing because it reflects the real price of the thing we buy instead of being manipulated by central banks.
The thing is that we are so acustomed to live with a permanently inflated currency, that we cannot even imagine what it is to be with a real currency, just like someone living in a cave watching shadows couldn't imagine what the outside world looks like.

To secure your seed, either store it on paper in at least two different places you trust, or create an encrypted file of it on a cold storage, deposit your encrypted file in a few secured locations (on CD-R for a hundred year of persistence) and clear all existence of your unencrypted seed. Don't use your hardware wallet for daily expenses, use a second wallet on phone for convenience.

wallet site allow you to trade, since the bitcoin/cash never leave their wallet, they just maintain balance, they can offer you very low fee for frequent trades.
Also wallet site keep you in legality, since you buy/sell from the site itself. If you buy from unknown source directly, the bitcoins you receive or the payment could be traced to activities deemed illegal by your government and they could condemn you. Also a third party like wallet site is often a better guarantee if you're not sure of what you're doing it can be better.

What is on the paper? If it's a list of word, you have to restore the account using a wallet like mycelium (I'm not the in the best position to counsel you a wallet).

This would be true if the amount of bitcoins that go for selling on bitfinex is the same as the amount of bitcoins that are sold by people coming from bitfinex.

you probably thought of this one, but try to be paid in bitcoin from your customer. 
register on multiple exchanges to spread the risk and lower their suspicion by massive withdraw. 
try to be upfront with the exchanges about what you do. maybe coin base thought you were buying for other "blacklisted" people. probably some of them are.
if all else fail, make your own tumbler from multiple account on different exchanges to make it harder for them to follow your money. They probably banned you because you sent bitcoin to blacklisted addresses. 
services like bitwage convert paycheck in bitcoin, they probably need to buy a lot of bitcoin all the time, you could search how they do it.
maybe you should search a specialized merchant for buying bitcoin instead of an exchange. I guess services that allow merchants to accept bitcoin needs a lot of cash vs bitcoins, they probably sell their bitcoins to someone just like you.

the major risks of bitcoins right now are :
- UASF soft fork, it will add uncertainty to the future of bitcoins, if it does not work it will mean that micro transactions are dead at medium term.
- regulatory crack down, if major governments feel threatened by bitcoin, they will want to control it, tax it and regulate it. only outlaws will be able to reap the true benefit of bitcoins.
- competition, bitcoin has some flaws, almost no other crypto-currencies offer the same qualities but the general public will probably don't care if crypto-xxx is too centralized or is inflationary.
At worst bitcoin will become a niche value store for enterprise and institution or rich individuals, like gold but better.

She is right. Under the pressure of bitcoin, the government will set up his own blockchain with unlimited coin creation and will severely control and limit all other blockchains.

@_date: 2017-06-02 15:21:56
I will try to help a little :
bitcoins are stored on the blockchain that is replicated on each full node around the world, anybody can see them.
bitcoins are associated with public adresses, if you own an adress, you control the bitcoins associated.
you own a public address by possessing the associated secret private key, which is a seemingly random chain of character.
A method of generating a private key is by using a list of character called a seed.
a wallet is a system that store the private key and or the seed, read the blockchain to display all the bitcoins you own and create transactions that enable you to transfer bitcoin possession to another public address.
it exists multiple type of wallets that can eprform one or all services, namely paper wallet (encrypted write down of the private key), wallet application (on phone or computer, do all), hardware wallet (secured storage and transaction generation), cold storage (store the private key and generate transaction offline) and brain wallet (mnemonic mean of memorizing the seed to restore a wallet).
PGP is a software for encrypting and deciphering data using private and public key (with the RSA algorithm), it's used under the hood by wallets to generate transactions.
a hash is a chain of character that is produced from a data, it has the property of generating always the same chain from the same data, while not being able to rebuilt the data from the hash. it is used as a verification system. In bitcoin a hash is necessary for adding transactions to the blockchain, it's made purposefully difficult to make it impossible for a single entity to hijack the entire blockchain.

Relying on 3rd party is not bad per se. You do it all the time. It works because you rely on 3rd parties that can be put in competition, and are generally accountable for their actions.

so basically, some miners could start mining segwit transaction exclusive blocks, enabling lightening network to run based on these transactions, then as people would start making micro transaction on lightening, the segwit transactions used as balance for lightening nodes (which would be heavy transaction, who could afford premium fee for being included considering the small segwit hash power available) would be validated on then network just as any other block, encouraging other miners to profit of the huge segwit fees ?

PGP is used under the hood, you should probably not using it for making transaction if you don't know what you are doing.
personally I opted for a hardware wallet, I use it with the provided app to make transactions.
I backed up my seed on CD-R after encrypting it, but you can do however you want, writing it on paper is pretty good if you are confident nobody will find it and that it will not get lost.
other options are smartphone wallet apps, but they can be hacked, especially if you are reckless with your phone. I heard that coinbase had a vault system which can be reassuring since they will not let you make mistakes, but be sure to understand what you do before acting. 
with bitcoins you are your own bank, which have (huge) benefits, but it also have responsibilities.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:12:46
I'm pretty confident in hardware wallet. The thing being that at worst, you can just destroy it and restore elsewhere with your seed.
The only thing that could happen is if your wallet has a backdoor and you happen to install this udpate and use your funds on a compatible wallet. Overall it's pretty unlikely, way more secure than any other method IMO.
What you really have to secure is your seed, against amnesia, death, theft or destruction.

The actions that users can take to make UASF work is to put their money where their mouths are. Either you buy hashing power on niceHash or you sell all the old coins to the new, or both.
But this will not work. individuals will not choose to put all their money at risk to have a small impact when they can choose to "free ride" the UASF with no risk.
Honestly the best solution would be for all the miners that support segwit to activate it even thought there is not enough hash power to reach a normal consensus.

I don't know if bitcoin consumes that much, at least I know it's partially exaggerated since some miners operate with other type of energy like geothermal.
But the question you have to ask is what is the cost of other systems ? They employ tons of people, take a long time that cost opportunities to the users and have very high open and hidden fees.
The only downside I would agree is that the cost of operating bitcoin is mostly energetic and that there would probably be a better way to use this energy while maintaining the PoW system of the network.

it's probably possible, but I think it must not be that simple, you would have to be registered on each exchanges, having valid bank accounts in banks that are accepted in each of these exchanges, then you'd have to withdraw cash (a few days), change/transfer your currency, (another few days) then deposit to the exchanges (another few days), and finally buy.
This makes it impossible to make the money circle around between exchanges in a realistic time, so the only way to profit for it is to have money in each exchanges already and this cost in term of opportunity to better use this money.
In short, if a small spread exists now, it's probably just the residual spread that is not worth it to balance out.

By encrypting your seed, you create a two factor authentication : to access the seed you need to *have* the backup file, and to *know* the password. If you put your file on a cloud service which is secured by a password, anyone can have the file if they know the password. This makes your security based on *knowing* both password, which is weaker.
If somehow someone gets his hands on your keepass, they could try to crack force your backup without you knowing they have it.
Personally I opted for CD-R backups in different relatively trusted locations.
That being said, if there is nothing linking your passwords together, it's pretty well secured, especially if you don't have millions in bitcoin.

The best outcome is activation of segwit by more than 80% of the miners before UASF, as originally planned. No chain split, no hard fork, totally seamless for users. But it will not happen since that 1 miner that represent more than 20% of the hash has clearly stated and showed that segwit is unacceptable for him. Considering that, the best option is that most of the remaining miners accept to mine the UASF chain, forcing others to fork or to disappear.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:32:37
UASF c'est un peu comme bruler le pont derriere soi... les miners ne veulent pas appliquer segwit car ça va permettre de créer des blocks qui valident ce qu'on appelle des chaines secondaires, ce qui permettra de faire passer beaucoup de transactions sur ces chaines et de propulser bitcoin dans une nouvelle aires pour ses utilisateurs. Mais pour eux ca va surtout faire baisser les frais de transactions et ca leur interdira certaines techniques qu'ils utilisent actuellement pour miner plus vite.
UASF c'est les noeuds qui decident de ne pas relayer les blocks des mineurs qui n'acceptent pas segwit, le problème c'est que si une majorité des miners choisissent quand meme de ne pas valider les blocks segwit, il n'y aura pas assez de puissance pour valider les blocks segwit, ce qui tuera de facto la chaine. en attendant que la chaine segwit meurt ou predomine, les deux coexisteront...

useful for the ones that get the new money, not useful for those whose money loses value because of the inflated quantity.
If ever a situation exists where an industry would actually benefit from a supply of money greater than what the market can allow at the moment (the typical premise of a recession), then an entrepreneur in the form of a banker or an industry leader can issue more credit than what he can actually pay. If his word is true ever subcontractor in the industry will accept his bonds and if his insight is good the industry will be able to repay these bonds. Hence the market will reward him for having correctly analyzed the situation. If he fails, he will lose all his investment and sub contractors will be punished by the market for having misplaced their trust, this case provide an healthy feedback that allow the market ot regulate the just quantity of credit and fractional reserve.
