we need to keep the banksters from pumping and dumping. Maybe put a limit on buy and sell orders.

You could sell CD's, or downloads directly from your website. This my make your label and your artists look like more forward thinking than your competition.

Great vid.I appreciate it. Question: if i have 8 btc in my mt gox  account, will i need to deposit them to the armory wallet, (will they be re_moved from gox to my armory wallet)? And, will the bitcoins show up as 8 separate addresses or bitcoin numbers in the armory wallet? Does each bitcoin have a unique set of numbers that always stays the same, i.e., when i withdraw them from gox and deposit them into any other address, will the keycodes (numbers) always stay the same? If so can i just write the numbers down from the paper wallet onto a piece of paper?  Thank You!!
