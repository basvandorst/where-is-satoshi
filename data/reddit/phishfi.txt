I'm not savvy enough on investing/trading to speak to your arguments regarding crypto's status as a bubble/Bitcoin's obscenely high valuation, but I do agree that it has all the makings of a bubble (although, I bought it at a price that I doubt it will ever fall back down to, so I don't care to sell regardless of FUD). However, I do want to respond to the first part of your comment:


This is also true of fiat currency, and should not be a "flaw" of crypto if it's a flaw of the entire market. The reality is that an internet/power outage powerful enough to meaningfully damage Bitcoin would also meaningfully damage most fiat currencies. In fact, due to just how widely decentralized Bitcoin and other cryptos are, I think fiat currency would suffer more.


This isn't entirely true. The method by which MimbleWimble created transactions is a very secure form. If that transaction is sent into the mempool from a secure connection (such as a trusted VPN, Tor connection, or another yet-unreleased decentralized internet-obscuring service), there could potentially be untraceable transactions.


This is kind of a vague statement, so it's hard to argue against (maybe intentionally). The type of public/private key encryption currently in use has ways of "hacking" them, via the use of brute force private key generation, but it's statistically impossible. Furthermore, Bitcoin users and developers will update the software to a newer variant that's even less susceptible to future vulnerabilities (one key example is quantum computing, which could be used to crack private keys, so there are already proposals for methods of generating transactions and blocks that cannot be mined by quantum computers faster than current hardware).
That's all I can think to address meaningfully. I think the key determinations most likely to impact Bitcoin's (and others') price is it's actually usability. If I can't send $100 worth of Bitcoin without including a $40 fee, or if the transaction is going to take days to send because I did not want to pay such a fee, then I'll use another service. 
A prime example of this is what's happening now on exchanges. It takes too long and costs too much to send Bitcoin from, for example, Coinbase to an exchange. Instead, it's easier to convert the Bitcoin to Ether, send Ether to the exchange, then conduct your trades in Ether instead of Bitcoin. 
I hope BTC gets fixed soon. It's greatest strength lies in its complete decentralization and the fact that it takes so much work for any modifications to get accepted across the community. The only problem with this strength is that the average internet user isn't going to care about these modifications to the same level as the users of last year and this year. As it becomes more widespread, it will get saturated with changes that less users will give attention to.

First, it could still be more profitable the mine at a loss considering the prospective value when the price goes up.

It's working fine with Google Wallet, and there's none of that. Google Wallet's implementation is that the app has to be open and pin has to be input before the NFC chip can act as a payment method. 
As for your internet access question, BTC (all cryptos) require access to the blockchain (or rather, web access so they can submit their change to the blockchain), so there's really no logical way for a person to make a payment from their device without some form of internet access. 
The only way you could possibly do it without the phone having web access would be by giving the purchasee (merchant) your private key in order for them to generate the transaction for you, which is incredibly unsafe (they would have full access to your wallet, not just the amount they intend to charge you). 
On the other hand, I suppose it's possible for your device to take the public address from an initial tap, create a transaction on your device, then tap again to get the merchant the encrypted transaction data so that they can submit it to the blockchain with little/no chance of being able to alter the transaction because it would already be signed by your device.

I absolutely agree, not to mention how impractical it would be to enforce this type of law!

Sorry that someone downvoted you. Oftentimes this sub is not very friendly to people who aren't reading every thread and all of its comments... Some people are extremely interested in BTC, and some (like you, it seems) have a healthy interest but not necessarily enough time to be that involved. 
As for hosting your coins online somewhere, so that it's easier to spend online, there are other options as well, Coinbase comes to mind. I like Coinbase quite a bit, but if you're holding on to a lot of BTC, it would be best to keep the majority of it someplace safe and maybe just move the money that you want to spend/trade over to a Coinbase account. One thing I wish Coinbase did was allow multiple "accounts" (basically a few different wallet addresses each with its own balance, like you have with multiple checking accounts from the same bank). That way I could start a couple wallets, one for spending/trading/giving away to friends, and one for saving, etc. 
I don't know about any of the other options, but I can guarantee that there are many more out there. 
Also, Coinbase is US only, if I'm not mistaken.

A number of factors probably all coming together at once, along with public scare that's forcing a lot of sales right now. 
As for expectations, that's tough to tell. I wrote a post a while back demonstrating that, if Bitcoin were to be come any sort of official currency, it's value (based on Gross Domestic Product and Gross World Product) would be upwards of $4 million each. Obviously, that's not going to happen any time soon, and honestly it's unlikely to ever happen (because most of the world doesn't believe that one currency is enough), but comparing that logic/math to BTC's current rate shows that it's at least worth a bit more than $600. All it takes is a couple big businesses to accept it and you'll seriously turn the value around!

Tap to pay (NFC payments) has been happening for a VERY long time in a lot of Asian, particularly Korea.
It's probably already been built for BTC, since the NFC chips can contain the exact same strings of data as a QR Code, so tapped an NFC tag could present the exact same command to the phone.

What are you on about this time? It's another form of investment, but it's easily liquidated funds... It's not like I'm suggesting anyone else do this too, or that I'm expecting to put all of my expendable money in BTC. I'm saying it would be cool to set a small portion of my regular savings into a BTC wallet just to have as a side account that's not in a bank account, and see if it generates profit on its own...
@_date: 2014-08-03 12:05:57
Compared to a savings account, an increase of more than 2% would make it way more profitable (since most standard savings accounts only return you something like 1-1.5% per year, not to mention the limits on withdrawals, etc). Alternatively, if BTC decreases in value, it just turns that account into a long-term account in the hopes that the value comes back up. If it doesn't, it was only a short-term account, not a retirement account or anything, so I (personally) wouldn't lose much. I meant "much of a loss to me" if it dropped.

Good point, I should have just started with the raffle info... 
I'm thinking of starting with 100 tickets at .01 BTC per ticket.

I'd like to limit the amount of tickets each user can buy to 5 tickets.

For mining pools, it means that the expenses of running the site/server/power are all a burden to their business and can be claimed against their revenue. The only earning they'll report as a result would be the crypto they gain by running the site. 
Exchanges will also only report gains/losses based on their transaction fees, and they'll claim expenses against those gains from running their service. 
For a mining pool to have to recognize each miner as a contractor is completely over-complicating the process, although technically they could see the IRS attempt to chase them down in that fashion, provided the IRS went deep enough into the weeds to prove they ever had a wallet through which all of this money was exchanged. 
This is a great question though. I think for now the answer is that a mining pool is just an online service and all they need to report is their earnings from running the pool. Ultimately, we will probably see some decision made by the IRS regarding mining pools, since that's a great place for them to start when they want to try to track down miners for auditing purposes (it'd be the first step in a very long, ridiculous process to try to hunt down a person's crypto wallets...).

Yea.. Vertcoin is in the same situation that Bitcoin is, in terms of government scrutiny. The only actual threat to cryptocurrency is centralization. I think it's near impossible to stop crypto from functioning without strangling the decentralization or stopping the majority of the internet from functioning (all the ports associated, types of packets, etc).
However, the one benefit Vertcoin has is its developers plans to maintain that decentralization through ASIC-resistance. Obviously, there are ways around it, but ASICs are the most dangerous course of action for cryptocurrencies.

@_date: 2014-08-03 17:56:25
No, but if that's what they're attempting to do (control the supply or manipulate the prices), then they can only do that as long as they actually have BTC. If they sell if everything they have, then they lose out on all the potential control they might attempt down the road. 
Keep in mind, though: 65 million dollars is less than 1% of the total market cap of BTC, so they really don't have much at all compared to the total market.

It's "funny" because hard-core Bitcoin enthusiasts think that sidechains could eliminate the need for altcoins by serving the same purpose (being able to test new features on the Bitcoin network without running the risk of damaging the entire network). 
It's honestly irrelevant, considering that there is nothing wrong with there being multiple cryptocurrencies/networks at the same time. Sometimes there are serious benefits to do so.
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:45:19
Having multiple currencies means allowing some to establish different algorithms and techniques so developers can see which has the best security and chance of success. 
Also, if one coin goes down there are alternatives for people to switch to quickly and with little delay. 
The last one is economics based. Some coins are experimenting with a standard inflation  because the bitcoin model runs the risk of creating drastic deflation.

Right. My guess is that Amazon is just going to leave this process alone for the time being because they have no actual involvement, except that they're making $ off the purchases. If this BTC-Voucher-Product flow works for all parties involved, then Amazon doesn't have to do any modification to their site and everyone's the merrier. 
I'm sure that at SOME point down the road all of these sites will start accepting crypto, but it's going to take a good amount of waiting before that finally comes around, considering how volatile all the coins are right now. Amazon isn't an investment firm, it's purely product sales. 
My post was just aimed at the comment though, about whether or not Amazon even knows this is happening behind the scenes of some customers' purchases. I'm POSITIVE that they do, at least to some extent.

Economically, any deflationary currency holds the probability of increasing in purchasing power as time goes on. As currency is removed from the pool, or more people are introduced to that currency and become users of it, the value of each denomination increases. 
What we're talking about here is its overall economic value as a currency compared to present day (inflationary) currency. Technically, Bitcoin is inflating all the way out until 2140-something, although it will get so low that it won't keep up with the increase in demand for that currency. 
The issue is that it's already worth something like $500-600 each, and that's only with an $8 billion market cap. The US alone has a GDP of something like $16 trillion (2000 times Bitcoin's market). This means that, in order for Bitcoin to overtake the dollar in usability, it'd likely have to be worth way more than a million dollars each, and that's just to match the US gross product. In 2012 the gross world product was $84 trillion, so over 5 times the US GDP.. That's $5 million per Bitcoin at it's present value, and $4 million each if all Bitcoin's possible were in existance today...

A lot of economists are a bit skeptical of Bitcoin's deflationary model. I was at a speech Monday where the speaker spoke to the issue of cryptocurrencies' scarcity. The thing to understand is that Bitcoin isn't the end-all/be-all of cryptocurrency. I know I'll take a lot of crap for saying that in the sub, but it's true.
There are a lot of economic models that may prove best for crypto, especially with its global nature. What we have to do is let the new cryptos come and go and see which ones last and which ones' models have the best chance of success. 
The U.S. is one of the only countries that believe there should only be one currency. Crypto is going to change that concept to the point of there being something like 10-20 or more currencies, especially once we get to the technological level where it doesn't matter what crypto you use. Someone's going to come up with something where you can buy a product from a store by tapping your phone, etc, and the store will detect the currency you're trying to use and let you buy it with that currency (as long as the store accepts it). 
I'm imagining a sort of standard like what we have with credit cards. I can swipe a Visa/Mastercard/AmEx, but not a Discover card at my local gas station, because it's what they accept. I don't have to do any extra work, though..
Bitcoin is a great introduction for the world, and it could very well be the de facto currency 30, 40 years down the road that a majority uses... We just have to wait and see.

I suppose that would work, but it opens up the risk for the bill to be worth *more* than the value written on the bill. 
If the creator of the bill has a method of identifying fraudulent bills, this shouldn't pose an issue. But you're right, having the public address visible ensures there's a way to quickly verify the balance.
My problem with having the public address visible is that a fraudulent bill could put a different public address on the fronts, each showing a proper balance, while there may be no private key or the private could on the bill could be empty...

There's a specific amount of blocks that get solved before the difficulty increases/decreases to match the amount of mining that's occurring.
