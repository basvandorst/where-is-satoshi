I'm probably no where near you, but I just signed up for my local area. (I'm just getting my first phone based bitcoin wallet) I was surprised at how many people are close-ish to me. They're all still 2hrs or more away, but that's closer than I expected.

It has grown 100% in the last day... and the hashtalk crowd being pushed out of paybase are moving the xpy over there... 
Of course... this from the scam that Hong Kong is currently working on:








Sounds... so familiar... we need to find an email address for the Hong Kong authorities and email them some links to look at.

It's beginning to feel like he has a domain destruction business. Who would ever use BTC.com after he's had it? Once he's done with mineral.com, that'll have a WOT rating of like -100 and be linked to everything from scamming to porn.

Is this the same Hong Kong that's looking at banning bitcoin use?   Just one of several articles about Hong Kong being pushed to ban bitcoin because of all the scammers that have flocked there.

I challenge you to point to one that has even lasted six months... they fail long before six months. Paybase was "here to stay" in mid-Jan and is closed effective Apr 30... that's 3.5 months... I know if feels like a lot longer... but the entire coin is not even 6 mos old and it was this time last year that Garza was posting his 'how to rip off people through mining scams'... this guy isn't even a year into this escapades and he's run through at least 6 'businesses' that i can tell. AND, that's not counting all the spin-offs like fastXPY, TeamXPY, etc.

If you get sent a wrong email with no prior formal association... the statement at the bottom means jack all.
If you get the email from an associate without contractual obligations (e.g. you're a club member and they spam you)... it's bad form to share it and the most they can do is kick you out of the club.
If you get it as a result of a business association and there's an agreement in place (e.g. An NDA or potentially a Non-Compete)... well, they probably have grounds to do something, but then it's a question of if they want to go to the expense to pursue it.

Coinbase is a fully registered corporation. 
File a complaint with your state Attorney General over it. (Or threaten to file a complaint and that will prob get your bank to pull their head out of their arse)

Tell her that you're going to file a complaint with the State Attorney General over the closure of your account.
Most states have an online form for consumers to file complaints. Pull it up in advance and make sure to take it with you to get any added information you might need to file your complaint.
Also, you might want to print out some of the stuff from coinbase.com (they have a pretty comprehensive about us section) and the article where that trading exchange company just invested in them.

They are implementing that when they reopen.
