If you only buy a technology when it has reached its potential what kind of risk are you bearing??? If you don't see the potential then don't invest in this. It is as some say currently not a great currency because its is too volatile. It cannot be used on one end before it changes in value on the other. It can lead to significant overpayment or underpayment. However, the potential is there for a shift in paradigm of what a currency is. Invest if you believe crypto is the future. Stay away if you want guaranteed returns or a ready to use currency. I am hodling. While current fiat is digitized in transactions it is not truly digital and still requires many people to manage. Crypto/digital currency will be the future. Keep trading shells if you want.

totally dude I bought more instead of selling... albeit only $50 dollars because I am le poor. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:44:57
I hodled and I'm new as of this month. I only put in 1k betweekn LTC,BTC,XRP, and ETH. I was ready to part with it when I gambled with it. So, I have to say watching yesterday was very entertaining and I bought a tad more at around 13700 BTC. People be flipping out but the memes are worth every penny.

I just bought more
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:35:04
I just did I think this is a bullish pullback in the works. Too bad I'm poor and could only get 50 USD worth. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:00:55
lol, Im a noob and bought at the first pull back before confirmation during the drop at around 13.7k. Still not upset. Sure, I could have got it lower but hey tis not a perfect science.

I would never buy BCH simply because I've seen videos of Roger. I'm new to crypto and only put 1k in this month, but guys is a douche so hard pass. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:01:12
I'm honestly just sad I don't have money to pump into it as soon as there is a bullish pullback
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:13:38
Also, the misinformation that major Bitcoin owner and owner of Bitcoin.com was selling Bitcoin and switching to BCH. Insider trading, new people not expecting volatility, and misinformation. It's a squeeze.

They waited a week to short so ppl would buy in on FOMO. Then introduced doubt with news and that coinbase Bitcoin cash fiasco. Now the big boys are shorting to take money from ppl that cave to fear. They will take those that bought high and reload the market at a lower price.

Who trusts a guy who was barred from the U.S. for selling explosives. Lol, people listening to this guy Roger Ver...just shows how little ppl research before they throw money away.

Honestly large shorts wouldn't have made since when the exchanges launched. Why not pump make people buy in on FOMO, then shortly after short the fuck out of it and sponge all the money from weak hands.

Or the fact that they are ramping down production as they move toward volta

OP how/what metrics were you using that made you want to buy at $7200?
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:29:34
I cashed out at 7200 with 13% gain so I will wait for a correction and hopefully this is a FOMO parabol that will dump hard in a fee hours
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:18:14
Im mainly looking at the hour chart since the retrace started. Looks like a possible head and shoulders forming ��

What about Electrum? For ppl that only have a few thousand?

Gottcha, I originally bought crypto in 2017 as it was tanking same way. This time I have been trying to use other metrics together. Mostly MACD, MA Cross, momentum, and RSI. I sold all of my BTC around 7200 because it was overbought and started taking up downward momentum. For the first time Im on the other side hoping it tanks further. Best of luck try and lock in gains without being too greedy. If you sell early before a correction be okay with sitting on the sidelines till it does. Fomo is our enemy ��
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:04:24
It will correct and you can take gains. Overbought
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:04:27
I set my stop sell wrong like an idiot and sold yesterday accidentally at 6950 instead of 7200. However looks like the reversal did happen. Now I hope it hits closer to the Fibonacci I was looking at and I will buy back in ��.
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:07:09
Personally after it originally tested 7400 and failed I sold. If this retest is not successful it is likely it will retrace. We all have to make decisions. 8 hours to get back I sold. We will see how it plays ��
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:07:42
Good downward movement in the hour and under charts and indices. Momentum, RSI, MACD all looking favorable for a continued drop in the short term atleast
