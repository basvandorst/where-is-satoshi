I just moved the rest of it now, at least I still have nearly half of my coins and they didn't take them all. Thank you for your help.

I thought it could be this. I installed the update 3.4.4 on the 10th April, from this URL 
As far as I am aware that is the correct website. 
I just checked the mainwebsite for update 3.3.5 and this is the url;

I am very concerned like I said I don't have much money. But I bought in when btc was at 4k, so I need to keep positive, at today's rate I only lost maybe 60$ from my original purchase. I just wanted to get answers to what could have happened.

on an external hard drive. But I have had it plugged in a while now, so maybe they gained access to that.

I just checked all software that has been installed in the past few months, and there is nothing I can see out of the ordinary.
Also, I have run an anti-virus program and Malwarebytes both came back with no problems. I am just worried that everything on my computer has been compromised. I have changed all my crypto information and put the files onto a USB stick and wrote down the codes onto paper and removed them from my computer. 
I just don't understand how it has happened, when I have done nothing different to normal. 
Thank you for your reply though, it must be one of them that you mentioned.

Yeap. I got so excited to see it hit 7k, as I bought in quite low. I am still only 70 dollars down rather than 175 if I am looking at my original investment. But it still sucks. I guess it is an expensive lesson to be more careful.
