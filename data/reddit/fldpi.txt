Yes, if this is the only change. Other modifications could possibly increase the throughput further.


This is covered by the paper. The security against double spending and selfish mining stays roughly the same.


20 1-minute confirmations are much more secure than 2 10-minute confirmations. The security is comparable for the same number of confirmations, not for the same confirmation time.

I don't think it does. Where did you read that?

Well, it's hard to say how it would affect the Bitcoin price (which would change the block reward, which in turn again affects security), but on a protocol level, there don't seem to be any.

Sorry, I was a bit busy this week and forgot to answer.
Table 7 is based on the current limit on throughput, i.e. 1MB blocks in 10 minute intervals, which is equivalent to 0.1MB blocks in 1 minute intervals. This is why the block requires more time to propagate through the network with a larger interval.
Table 9 (where the security is compared) shows different combinations of block sizes and intervals. You can find the detailed results [here]( (click on "Impact of Block Size").

The stale rate can actually be measured (and simulated for other block intervals/sizes) and is (or was last year when the measurements were done) at 0.41% for Bitcoin. This is adressed in the paper, the stale rate is actually one of the most important factors, but it is very similar for 1min block intervals, which is why the security would not suffer.

Reaching most of the miners and reaching all nodes is not the same thing.
Edit: Also, your math is wrong. You assume that everybody mines on top of the old block before everyone receives it. However, if a 30% minig pool mines a block, these 30% of the mining power will immediately mine on top of the new block. Everyone else will do the same once they receive it.

Hmmm... I'd have to look into that.

That is the value for the standard block propagation mechanism. However, many miners use a relay network  which makes block propagation between miners much faster (there are more tables if you scroll down).

Ethereum does not actually use GHOST. The consensus protocol of Ethereum is actually less secure than Bitcoins. The linked paper actually also compares Ethereum to Bitcoin.
