The average person is late to the show. They can say all they want I'm not going, sounds like a bad idea, but then they see their favorite band will be playing (Ebay) or their favorite food is being served (more and more local restaurants everywhere) and they finally start to change their tune. IMO

It's funny how r/bitcoin doesn't get this point. I've been an active member of this subreddit for months. I'd never pump thousands in these machines but it's because I have accounts at 6 online exchanges and know how to get BTC at anytime of the day. Most people have no idea how to acquire BTC nor would they give an online exchange their residence/passport/bank info online. Want digital currency to spread? Let John Smith put his info in this ATM, don't criticize him for getting interested in the very cause we're all sitting here bickering about.

You're right, the palm scan is simply stored as a hash. 
Hashes are also called one-way hashes because once they are created they cannot be reversed.  This means that a hash cannot be deciphered to determine the contents of the original message.Therefore hashes can only be used to compare data.
It's like a password. Not a government NSA conspiracy to invade your privacy forever..

The way I see it, global confidence growth is portrays market capitalization. Therefore, we will cross a threshold where a decrease in confidence no longer exerts enough pressure to drive the price down. (e.g. 2 billion now, in the 8 billion market cap exerts much more downtrend than 10 billion in a 200 billion market cap bitcoin economy) IMO.

There is ample good press (Paypal, Bitpay NFC, UK sees promising future with crypto, the list goes on...), which can be found anywhere but a downward trend persists. Exchanges have be hacked and cleared out, not to the extent of Mt.Gox, but the news and price have definitely seen a disconnect.

If they think bitocin is scary wait til they find out about bitcoin..
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:31:52
That's pretty funny to look at. Even a pessimist must say things are going rather well...
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:16:47
I ordered one last night. Very excited to give this as a gift!
@_date: 2014-07-11 03:06:18
Agreed. Pretty weak.
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:39:08
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:23:35
How did these guys title themselves as a bitcoin bank? That's going to scar bitcoin in the media at their false proclamation. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:35:38
They will gladly take your CAD but convert it at there banks rates to USD to credit your account.
@_date: 2014-04-24 14:55:55
Shrem approved?
@_date: 2014-05-31 04:34:31
Can confirm. Peter Schiff is a dodo head. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 10:10:09
Higher than it's ever been? It's a pretty interesting experiment collaborated by, just a guess, more than two guys.
@_date: 2015-05-30 09:50:05
Decentralization. Commendable collaboration to those who put in the effort to contribute.
@_date: 2015-05-30 10:23:19
We can work together and make it even bigger next time. Isn't that the point of this whole thing?
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:39:19
@_date: 2014-11-28 03:53:58
Haha, have half a hand job for pointing that out @_date: 2014-08-31 00:17:11
The risk of volatility is the only downfall of acceptance. However, this is mitigated by companies such as Bitpay and Coinbase. They convert to local currency immediately for the merchant nullifying said risk.
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:07:19
This. Up^boat

What does this accomplish?
@_date: 2014-06-09 23:56:47
Second that. Naivety and wishful thinking around here is starting to consume productivity.
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:20:55
have a mutton chop for your troubles @_date: 2014-05-31 02:52:34
Woof, woof. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 13:24:39
Move them to a BIP38 encrypted wallet with multiple backups, dig a hole in my back yard, your backyard, and someone else's yard. Then purchase a relatively modest set of treasure chests, and bury the wallets for a rainy day in 2020. Something like that.
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:20:45
Well if it was a bitcoin community goal to ensure 100% economically efficient solar mining at a certain point how does this experiment not win?
@_date: 2014-11-25 17:37:10
You obviously deserve a mutton chop private
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:30:53

Once a scammer, always a scammer. Hard to redeem yourself with this community, rightfully so.

Ceteris paribus. The Bitcoin anomaly is anything but on a paved road to the spotlight.. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:35:33
Sooooooo sick...

@_date: 2015-01-28 00:52:44
By currency, do you mean currency? If so, then yes.

@_date: 2015-01-08 21:15:25
It's a great opinion, of the status quo. However, an economy that is based on math, maximal efficiency, being run on sustainable resources and providing access to billions is much different than what is currently in Paul's knowledge of traditional finance...
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:50:20
Ya, it's been an interesting morning researching this for myself. Bitcoin.org needs to update their information in a big way...
To my knowledge the latest version of the Bitcoin Core Software has definitely been updated since September 2014... :/
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:49:23

We should have seen this coming...
@_date: 2015-01-01 18:09:04
THIS. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:37:04
Pretty much all of the people on Miami Beach would see it. If it makes it past the trolls we'll discuss. :)
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:36:24
Can confirm. This also makes my day at 4:30am.

Are you in contact with these large players? Let them know it wasn't the best timing for their actions... 
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:30:11
This is a phenomenal idea. If you check out their website and tour route it's pretty impressive. Raising some serious awareness across the continent. Well done!

Minimal effort required to make enough for a beer or two here. I just thought I would see what happened. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:50:37
And only 0.00002% have used it. HUGE room for improvement gentlemen.
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:25:10
Sooooo, the price tanks tonight or tomorrow morning?
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:08:45
9am EST? They're late! Alert the others and let's get down there with the pitch forks.
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:30:16
1. Yes
2. The possibilities
3. 3 hours. I like instant. You'll get there. ;-)
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:24:40
K, this must be getting serious.
@_date: 2015-11-18 06:07:57
You sir, are capable of being downvoted.
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:55:31
Just get some popcorn, Jim. Enjoy the show. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 17:20:55
Have some more. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:48:20
I see what he did there...
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:21:43
Can confirm. Resentments still linger. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 15:45:29
They finally got internet service for those living under a rock. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:05:02
Did this JUST appear or is it  another blank screen that's been around for weeks?

@_date: 2015-02-26 16:07:08
Is there a black market for Bitcoin developing in the region?
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:54:51
You don't see the draw for more publicity? Just because you, an experienced blow stamp advocate, don't use it doesn't mean elderly womem and the curious people shouldn't. You're trash talking people helping the value of BTC increase. Fail.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:49:27
Nailed it! I'm pulling out! Back to Polaroid for this guy! 
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:00:29
It's just curious people, average purchase was only 0.563 BTC. Let'em get their feet wet even if you don't agree with it. All good for BTC right?
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:05:49
I'm on the phone with VirtEx and all is fine. Your post even says call them ;)
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:01:14
Come onnnnn
@_date: 2013-10-20 21:18:23
Sent my info too. Still no response. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 18:28:07
The second rule of Bitcoin is: you TALK about Bitcoin! Third rule of Bitcoin: if someone yells “sell!”, goes crazy, or cashes out, Bitcoin is not over. Fourth rule: only six confirmations needed to exchange a Bitcoin. Fifth rule: we progress one bubble at a time, fellas. Sixth rule: the Bitcoins are finite. No stocks, no bonds, no printing more money. Seventh rule: Bitcoins will go on as long as they have to. And the eighth and final rule: if this is your first time hearing about Bitcoin, you have to buy Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:38:21
Imagine buying tulips with BTC in 1636...
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:44:40
Very likely whistling, but it's the hop in the step that really sells it.
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:14:39
This is what perplexes me. I got into mining, finally fired up last week. Spent 800 USD total, got free electricity, and I'm currently minting 0.008 BTC per day. Correct me if I'm wrong but with a dash of optimism, and a sprinkle of hope, at future speculations, I'm doing pretty damn good.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:47:52
Don't you think it's more aesthetically pleasing to see whole numbers as a new comer? More and more people are learning about Bitcoin by the day at a rapid rate. Wouldn't you rather buy 60 mBTC with the little money you can afford to put into Bitcoin, rather than 0.06 BTC? Just seems like ya it will come, but shouldn't we get the ball rolling a little faster?
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:27:28
What if everyone just started using BTC and said to hell with debt and all that other jazz?
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:26:06
I've booked two flights with BTC now! And as an early adopter I'm getting these flights for pocket change of my initial investment :)
@_date: 2013-09-18 18:26:46
What's your plan then?
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:40:12
So is there two in Calgary now?

why is it nearly impossible to find the bitcoin t-shirts?

That's my favorite t-shirt :)
@_date: 2013-10-28 04:29:29
I think the point people are missing through all the silk road/pyramid scheme/jealousy is the change it brings on the global level. Ladies and gentlemen we have just brought the financial system to the micro level.
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:30:55
Get yourself some BTC shwag! 
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:43:42
Ya, works great. Why are you such a jerk?
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:24:57
I'm gonna go ahead and agree with this guy. A boombox that talks to other boomboxes? Where do I send my BTC??
@_date: 2013-11-03 12:21:51
Right before I head abroad! Genius.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:10:29
What if Mom owns BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:55:45
Ya, you're right. Neat hobby for someone who has a sizable BTC investment though.. It will make more than 800 USD ultimately.
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:55:09
Satoshi heard enough.
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:26:20


Almost 4 billion ;)  keep up.

Don't count your Bitcoins out juuuust yet.
