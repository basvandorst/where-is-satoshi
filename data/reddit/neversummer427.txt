so if I have BTC in Gdax and want to move it to my new Ledger Nano S that's setup for Segwit, how do I do it to avoid fees?

this is correct. they keep temps in the 60c-70c range by under powering them so they don't burn out. Gaming and Rendering have major more wear and tear on GPU's than mining.

I never said you said them. They are quotes of the investment industry.
The people in this sub too often have no clue what they are talking about and don't see an issue with their portfolio dropping 50% to 70% and holding bags of tokens that will many will be worth nothing in a year or two.

I'm not talking undervolting, I'm talking about throttling. And yes it also has the side effect of using less energy, but it's equally about wear and tear. It's not profitable if they have to replace the cards every year
