Good work. The interface is definitely a bit cleaner. I like how the Price updates in real time, but I don't like how it flips red/green every second or two. It's a little uncomfortable to my eyes. I think the red/green changes are fine for your 1 and 24 hour fields because it's not blinking incessantly. Perhaps that's just me.

He's lost a billion since becoming president, not to mention he's not taking a presidential salary. If he was looking for more wealth, he wouldn't have run for president. You aren't genuinely curious. 
Clinton, Bush and Obama all got massively richer after being president. Trump's net worth went down. 
If there were a gauge for corruption monitoring, net worth post presidency would kinda tell you everything you need to know. I mean, that's the bottom line.
Trump is fighting the federal reserve. Finally someone is calling them out consistently.

This monkey you speak of was supposed to crash the market. The opposite happened and the DOW is up an unprecedented 30% since he was elected. If the all-time high isn't a great enough indicator for you, GDP has been comfortably over 3% for the last 2 quarters (they said 2% was the new normal to make Obama look good). The economy is flying and it's about ready to go even higher next year since taxes are looking like they are going to pass with McCain on board now. 
Get over your bias, this market is getting stronger. Bet on the FAANG stocks going higher through 2018, especially Apple when they repatriate their overseas earnings.

No, the US economy is actually growing. 3 straight quarters of 3% + growth. That's not tanking, that's called growing. You're living in a fantasy world where you just can't allow anything this administration does to make you happy. Stop watching the news, it's propaganda. Obviously.
Remember when a bunch of analysts were saying that 2% is the new norm? It's because they were trying to make Obama look good. But now Trump is about to double that 2% next year. Remember how all the media was trashing the tax cuts? Immediately afterwards, like 17 huge companies came out and gave bonuses of $1k to at least half a million employees, and some raised the minimum wage to $15. They were trashing the cuts because they know that the growth that's about to be unleashed next year is going to make Americans happy... despite that Trump is the one that is bringing it.

Hmm, I don't know. It depends on the person and their end-game strategy, I suppose. I was thinking at some point (20k?) to take out just a little, so that I get my initial investment back. Then take out in small pieces as it climbs (50k, 100k). Then hold on to a little for MOON landing :) 
This way I take advantage if it keeps climbing, but I've got my initial investment back for sure. I'm still thinking about it, honestly.

lol Name the policies that attributed to the rise in GDP after Obama left. Because I tell you what, the last time Obama had 3% GDP in one quarter was 3 years ago... now all of a sudden (3 years later) it jumps up past 3% for 3 consecutive quarters... after "the previous administration" handed Trump a robust 1.2% 1st Quarter.

Trying to guess when to get in and out is insane. If you think it will ultimately get to 50k or 100k and that's where you want to get out, just kick back until it gets there. But getting spooked and jumping in and out is no bueno.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:06:44
I agree. BTC has a huge jump on the competition, but these current issues are devastating to holding that lead. As everyone can see, all the alts (especially bcash) are making moves, getting national airtime and touting their benefits over bitcoin. 
On the other side, so many people are complaining of not being able to transfer their btc, fees too high, switching to alts just for the convenience. This has to get fixed or it's going to keep trending down. We have a huge lead globally and we need to maintain it. Also, Coinbase will add more alts next year, which means more people will be trading/diversifying out of btc. We need LN soon, or perhaps an increased block size.

I vote no. I'd rather see the $16,000 vs $16. It gives the impression of more value. Like a stock that is worth $1000 vs one that is $16. Just by looking at it, I'd assume the larger one was the better company. Whether or not it's true, I don't know. 
Most people don't have a full bitcoin anyway. So when any new person asks, they'll immediately find out that their friend or family has fractions of them.
Also, if you change it to $16, Bitcoin Cash will look like the far more valuable coin at $1500. I think that REALLY does them a favor.

So true. It's stalled out for the time being and desperately needs Lightning.

You "visited" the Philippines and all of a sudden you're an expert on their system? lol I live here, and what you posted is ridiculous.
The real estate market is crazy. Just out my window alone I can see 12 condo skyrises being built. Every one of them has massive Chinese investors that are buying them up pre-sell for investment. I know, I went to all of their showrooms. Maybe you also never heard of BPO? It's literally the biggest industry here with US and MANY other countries investing due to Philippines' gov't easy tax policy for foreign investment. Everyone I know practically works in this field.
What's more, they don't make "cents per week". You should add a little more hyperbole. Minimum wage is closer to 12k pesos/mo. That's minimum. Filipinos can live on half that easily.

@_date: 2018-05-28 00:32:40
Right on. Enjoy your trial here. I've lived here almost 2 years, so I'll give you my quick perspective. 
The best parts for foreigners are Makati and Taguig as you may already know. Outside of there can look pretty intimidating/dicey, but I've never had any problems.  The worst parts about living here... customer support is beyond poor, imo. Waiting in line 10 minutes behind one person at a fast food or grocery store is not at all uncommon. If someone whips out a credit card or some sort of senior discount card, get in a new line. 5 minutes more. No joke. You'll see. lol Scheduling installers or people to do work... be prepared to wait all day, perhaps cancel at the end of the day, not call you back, stop answering your calls, reschedule 3 or 4 times. Customer support is POOR everywhere. They're SUPER nice, but poor service all around. Also walking. Everyone walks slow and in no discernible pattern, the paths are crowded and half the people are looking down at their phones while walking. You'll bump into THEM if you don't move. They won't even look up. Walking here drives me insane. There are tons of things I can complain about.
The good, of course, is that it's cheap to live here and I can actually save. In Makati and Taguig it's got all the pluses of American lifestyle - Chili's, TGIFridays, health food, good malls. Use Grab when you get here, it's like Uber. My first day here I looked for a taxi on a Friday night for over an hour and gave up. Lots of positives, mostly money related. Footlong Subway with bottled water is 5 bucks. Mcdonalds egg mcmuffin is 2 bucks (versus the 4.80 I paid back home). Prices are good :)

@_date: 2018-02-15 16:24:26
Right. But my point is that perhaps giving the government so much bitcoin transfers the ownership of it from the people, to government. Which brings us right back to the situation we are in. Maybe I'm wrong, but I was just thinking about it.
Then again, if it's a world currency, the US government will still only hold a fraction of it (even though it would be somewhat sizeable).

My thoughts have always been, even if you lose a high risk bet, you still have time to make it up (as long as you aren't too old, and it's not a ridiculous gamble - which btc isn't). I'd also have an exit strategy to cash out original investment.
