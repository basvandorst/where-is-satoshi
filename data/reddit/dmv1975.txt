Fuck Jim Harper, fuck the Bitcoin Foundation, and fuck the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Fuck them up their stupid asses.

Thank you, now I understand. Glad to see not everyone is elitist around here.

She is being interviewed by youtuber bravetheworld. Here is the first place I saw this, on her channel: How The Silk Road Case Affects Us All:

Absolutely correct. Bitcoin is legitimate no matter if goons with guns say it is or not.

Thank you. I have heard of a 51% attack before, but nothing I had seen posted about Ghash really said anything about a 51% attack. Between your comment and that of I now understand. Thank you.

I doubt he will reply at all. Sexual deviants like senator Man Chin who get their kicks from sadistic control over people don't know how to have two-way interaction. He only knows how to hurt people while he jacks off under the table.

Maybe, I don't know. I'm just saying she is the one interviewing the lady and her channel is where I first saw that video.

Here is the post I was thinking of, sorry it took so long for me to post it here:

So instead of just mining on their own, miners team up with other miners to have more mining power, and in turn share the mined bitcoins? I didn't know about that. It's interesting.
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:42:01
I don't understand what this means. I've seen a few posts about this, but I have no idea what's going on here. Can someone please enlighten me?
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:44:52
Fuck you, Ben Lawsky.
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:04:04
Sorry I annoyed you with my question. I guess all the other posts about it have been down voted to oblivion and that's why I can't find any information. Maybe someday I will learn to fucking read, asshole.

If he is modeling himself after Chris Hansen, what he is doing is not journalism. Hansen uses entrapment to create sensationalism.

The thing you said about difficulty reminded me of a quote, which some say was originated by Gandhi (disputed):
"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."
Bitcoin has left the first phase, and now people are laughing. I think the fighting part will be fierce, but the victory will be sweet.

There totally is a WordPress for Bitcoin, or rather, Bitcoin for WordPress! I don't have the link with me right at the moment, but there is an excellent Reddit post that walks you through step by step on setting up your WordPress ecommerce store to accept bitcoin directly. If you know anything about WordPress and installing plugins, you'll have no problem following it. I will try to find the link and post it here this afternoon, or if anyone knows the post I'm talking about, feel free to post it. It uses electrum and gives each customer a separate address to send payments to, but they all go to your electrum wallet. I set it up in a testing environment when I saw it and it worked great.

So could you convert from USD to BTC to GBP to USD and keep doing that in a circle for profit?

Considering the post didn't say anything about a bitcoin 51 attack, I am interpreting your comment as assuming I knew more than I did, and that lmgtfy thing is just snarky and unhelpful.

Hello good person

Well, it's a tough lesson, but it's a good one. I learned it with fiat about 10 years ago. I haven't been to a casino since.

How does this work? I have a little bitcoin I can give away. It's not much, but I'm new to bitcoin and I just want to do a transaction. I bought some from coinbase. It is supposed to be here Tuesday.

I like the reference used in the cryptographic hash section: "The root of all evil." That's funny.

We've only heard OP's side of the story. And bringing government into the equation is kind of antithetic to one of the main features of bitcoin. This problem can be solved by the free market. If blockchain doesn't satisfy enough customers, they will lose business.
