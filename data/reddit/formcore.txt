Use an exchange to *exchange* bitcoins, buy &amp; sell.
but any bitcoins not being exchanged are safer in a wallet to which only you have the private keys.
If you put your keys on an exchange you are temporarily giving full control of them to the exchange, and if they get hacked or just shut down they are **gone**
You can keep 20btc on your local wallet and just send 1 to the exchange when you need to trade with 1 btc.
@_date: 2016-08-26 11:52:12
I'd rather pay fees that support the network than have all of my coins dissappear.
I also don't think it's worth giving up freedom for convenience.
I mean, if you're consistently trading then, yeah, keep the amount you are trading on the exchange but remember that it's instantly at risk the second it's on there.

I'll agree that it's super confusing.  
I think that for the average joe it's confusing to sell with bitcoin at all... but I think the 12.5% fee of paypal+ebay is enough to make people learn.
The fee on a £200 sale, £25.  
I can not stomach that.

A few of the videos that I've seen like this, explaining how the government can't be trusted and how the "debt is unpayable"
I have a question about the "global debt".
Why can't we pay it back?
I understand that they say "you owe your neighbour $10 but only $5 exists, and printing money means borrowing it" or something... but...
Why can't you work your debts off?
Say, if the banks owe the bonds $50, offer to mow their lawns every weekend until it's settled?

It claims that HIVE was a malware *suite* for linux, and that they could tailor their payloads for different computer setups. [HIVE](
I'm not saying Arch is *unsafe*, but with the things I've read, and until they release more specifics... acting like linux is a bullet-proof shield in this scenario isn't accurate. 
Perhaps *Linux* refers to Android?  
Maybe specific linux servers, or only the most typical setups (i.e. Ubuntu) and maybe they *need* physical access... but honestly... I don't know for sure.

If you have some foresight, you could give the CIA "reason" to target you.
Start an anti-cia propoganda blog, send a few emails making claims that could be interpreted as a threat to CIA etc. and you could then claim in court that the CIA targeted you because you're an enemy.

Thanks for this, I'll look around.
I'm still a bit disappointing that Coinbase doesn't seem to like me :(

Paying somebody to pay for you.
Steam allows bitcoin, but they use bitpay... and from a company perspective, it makes sense.
They don't have to worry about the risks or benefits, they don't have to worry about calculating costs or installing any payment systems themselves and in the end it's just more $$ in the bank.
They might *accept* bitcoin, but if the price rises 100% or drops 100% overnight, it means nothing to them because either way they get the same amount of fiat.

The fee was too low because I messed with the settings, it's entirely my fault for missing a decimal place.

How many transactions does the world process daily?
How many transactions can bitcoin process daily?
There's a long way to go yet and you shouldn't be 100% sure that this will be a "global currency" considering that the problem with a "global currency" is largely political and not totally due to fiat faults.
You're honeymoon period I believe?
@_date: 2016-06-24 13:29:13
I agree with your points.
but I'm just saying that you can't be absolutely 100% that Bitcoin will succeed.
Being a global currency is something bitcoin can, and probably will do once if overcomes politics and network problems... but there's always a slight chance that either a competition will overtake bitcoin or politics / network issues won't be as easily overcome.
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:07:14
I may have come across as overly critical in my first response, I do believe bitcoin is a better currency than fiat... it's difficult to articulate why I feel like I have physical access to *my* bitcoin but feel like fiat is the "imaginary credit" system.
I only wanted to point out the obstacles that exist.
@_date: 2016-06-25 20:12:43
Steam cancelled the order but refunded the equivalent into my steam wallet so I just put it through and it's fine.
Also, since setting my fee back to normal I've had zero issues and recieved confirmations within a few blocks so, I guess lesson learned?

Hear me out here, I'm new-ish.  
btc is at $660 - $670
Isn't that "high" considering?
I was under the impression that btc was having a really good few months for price, I don't know enough about the market to say that I wouldn't lose money.
I've been dropping fair chunks of money into btc lately and it's been up and down, I wouldn't recommend people with even less knowledge than myself to swap gbp for btc.
Then again, I'm poor and losing even £50 would be a disaster
I've been putting what I can into it and HODLing but g'damn being a newbie these charts are frightening.
Whilst I'm here though, and with the EU stuff and all that... Is there anybody who knows how to USE btc in UK? like, to actually REPLACE GBP... a VISA card or groceries... that kinda stuff?
*holy shit, I just realised how much better looking through your wallet is compared to a bank statement! so often my bank statements show "available balance" with NO hint towards where my money went at any point in time!*

If china start investing in bitcoin, and this increases bitcoin's success I hope it also increases adoption over here.
I find that it's still not easy enough to get involved with for the people who aren't well versed in bitcoin and it's difficult to explain the appeal of it to the people who just don't care much about their money.
but I want to be able to use it more :(
@_date: 2016-06-25 09:18:45
Sadly, I still cannot use btc to buy my food.
Coinbase won't accept me because I don't have a passport or driving license and there's not that many local places adopting here.

What's the fee on Ebay /paypal now?

@_date: 2017-01-20 22:29:14
I want to ask.  
:disclaimer: I don't know what I'm talking about, these questions are all serious and I'm just a curious hodler :/disclaimer:
Miners require expensive hardware and incur high electricity bills to mine, correct?
This happens because bitcoin requires a lot of hashing power?
Bitcoin requires a lot of hashing power because the "difficulty" is set by the network in response to how much hashing power is available? 
Or is it something else that defines difficulty?
Assuming it's hashing power available, the difficulty adjusts in response to a computational arms race, right?
IF block get too full AND fees aren't met by users, miners will leave because it's less profitable?
Less hash power means that the difficulty adjusts and the network continues to chug along at roughly a block a minute?
HOWEVER, now that difficulty has dropped, miners can mine for far cheaper and what was once a net loss, becomes net profit again?
Is that how this works? because if we DO reach block capacity, I see no reason why it should be the users fees that subsidize the miners as much as it should be a reduced requirement of hashing power... that was kind of the point of "ASIC Resistant" altcoins wasn't it?
@_date: 2016-06-25 09:22:56
Do dynamic fees act relative to the likelihood that they will be confirmed?  
It looks like the slider always acts relative to the fee that was set before it in client.

I... have never used an exchange.
I have tried in the past, but they require identification and the only identification I have, they do not accept.
@_date: 2016-11-11 14:28:40
I'm guessing that because of how many possible addresses there are, the chances of generating the same address twice would take an incredibly long time... so whilst it would be a lot shorter to generate two addresses with the same first 6 characters... it's still incredibly rare.
Generating the two with two matching characters is easy, but gets less and less likely with each consecutive character you try and match...
It's just that, with the amount of addresses generated now, 6 seems to be about the likelihood of their being a similar address generated elsewhere?
Personally, mine has 4 matching addresses up to the first 7 characters.

In regards to  as I'm also in the UK.
Our banks have no up front fees for the user.
There ARE fees for retailers, this is passed on in cost to the customer. (some very small businesses simply can not afford to accept cards, but then that inconvenience of cash on the customer is also hard on their business)
If you go into an overdraft accidentally, the fees are enormous.
If you have an overdraft setup that you intend to use, you have to pay for that.
Basically, there's no fee for using your card.
But a bank is a business and they will get your retailers and they will royally fuck you up if they can catch you in a bad spot with cash.
(A lot of people I know are in their overdraft 100% of the time, pay-day brings them back to $0)
Payday loans are also a big thing over here, I know a couple people that are constantly taking out small loans because they ran out of money.
**tl;dr** Our banks aren't a charity, they charge our retailers, they're nice if you never need anything from them except for the money in your account but loans and services will cost you.

I can't afford 1 BTC and there's a definite mental barrier there, 1 BTC is a weird milestone that gets farther and farther away each day.
I manage to keep at least one paycheck ahead in bitcoin (that is to say, if for some reason pay day doesn't roll around, I have enough btc to make it to the next whilst I try and sort out whatever cost me a payday).
Bitcoin is a decent place to put money, but I find it hard to spend and it stays as luxury or emergency money... not "day to day" money.

You can try getting a government issued ID as well, they cost ~£15.
Other than that, I've used bittylicious in the past and it's been alright for very small sums.
If you're trying to trade in any sort of volume though, you're going to need ID.

I don't think it counts as "weeb", it's Anime for the west.

I don't really know much myself but, I think the idea is that, because BCH and BTC share the same proof of work, there's currently enough power in the bitcoin mining pools to launch a 51% attack on BCH?
Meaning that bitcoin miners are so much bigger than BCH, they could consistently mine on BCH and poison the blockchain.
Correct me if I'm wrong?
There was also the thing about, some company had a proprietary mining ASIC? and that gave them a massive advantage?
BTC patched out the ASIC, but BCH did not?
I honestly find it hard to find the technical facts when there's also so much politics and fighting going on.
From what I can tell, BTC has problems, BCH has problems.
Both make it difficult to understand wtf is going on.

Everybodies idea of what counts as "harassment" is going to be different, I try not to use race, gender, sexuality, etc. as things that bend the rules though... and try to just use them as a criteria to  draw hard lines that make sense next to the other criteria... that is to say "race" shouldn't be easier to harass against than age, hair colour or food preference.


I agree with this, generally there's a lot of fear of being called out as a "racist", even if something is legitimately impacting you enough to be a real concern.
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:36:06
I don't know about brainwashing, I'm only going to speak for myself.
I'm from the UK,
* I don't agree with harassment
* I don't agree with deliberately using somebodies beliefs to upset them
* I don't agree with randomly attacking people without knowing *their* stance on their religions beliefs ^(That is to say, there could be muslims that don't agree with death penalties)
* I *do* think that religions get too much of a free pass to be shitty and it's a double standard.
If you tell people that you think somebody should die because of being homosexual, then you should probably *expect* bad things to happen, and you can't say that it's okay for you to be shitty but not them... If you're not getting arrested for harrassing homosexuals, homosexuals shouldn't get arrested for harrassing you... just make sure that  they actually *are* the people you think they are before you go arresting innocent people.
also, I'm on this sub, so I'd also much rather have bitcoin over banks.

@_date: 2017-05-15 16:53:18
Because it is a pain in the ass and hard to *learn*.
To be fair, I recently got a tx stuck in limbo because my wallet didn't set a high enough fee.
 * it's damn hard for me to buy btc, I don't have an ID that most reputable places accept on top of a name change in the past.
 * Whenever I *have* used it, I've been terribly paranoid about something going wrong and coin just dissappearing.
 * Waiting for confirmations isn't instant enough (yet?)
 * In order to use BTC I had to read, research and invest time and effort... looking at which wallets are good, what addresses are for, how btc works, what a fee is... etc.
I like btc, but I put the effort in to use it... if I asked my brother to shoot me over .05 btc for something I just sold him, I only imagine I'd get a "huh? Can't I just send you the money and you buy btc instead of me buying it and sending it?"

If bitcoin hits $10,000 I'd "buy" bitcoin by trading off whatever I do now for money.
Work for 0.001 btc an hour
Sell a car for 0.1 btc
At $10k I'll probably still buy my steam games, and I'll still need to replenish what I spend.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:06:34
What about the idea that *nobody* can buy *all* bitcoin?
That if anybody *tried* to buy *all* bitcoin, the price would just increase exponentially.
Like, say  tomorrow, Bill Gates *did* decide to buy every bitcoin... well... by the time he gets halfway through, bitcoin is going to be too expensive for him to buy anymore because he's created the demand.

I'm not saying she's clearly a genius, or that her wealth is attributed to her intelligence alone but by simply not wasting the opportunities afforded her she's done well.
and I'm not saying she's "Doing something right to get that wealthy", I'm saying "She's doing something right, and that's afforded her more experience and a different perspective to us"
She has a LOT of money, and right now, I feel that's relevant.

I care that she values BTC more than GBP.
And she MUST value GBP if she's selling products FOR GBP^(and a lot of it)

But she herself said she regrets turning down jobs for btc.
@_date: 2016-07-20 12:08:03
I don't care if she knows how economy works, I care that she values bitcoin.
Hell, does everybody using the dollar know economy?
And yet the dollar is valuable because people want it even though they don't understand economy.
Besides, she handles a shit-ton of money, yes she probably has people doing it for her and probably doesn't value money the same way I do but god-damnit she's worth a lot and has a lot so clearly she's doing SOMETHING right.
@_date: 2016-07-20 15:34:29
She's obviously doing a lot of stuff just to stay in the public eye, sure... but it works and if the particular flavour of publicity for somebody worth $20,000,000 is "Bitcoin is currently more stabl than GBP"... I'll take it.
People here don't seem to like Lilly Allen for some reason... but she's got a lot of money and therefore has a *different* experience with large sums of money **and** she hasn't totally fucked it up...
I'm gonna say it, I like her music and I think she's got some talent... I think her opinion on bitcoin has some relevance to helping people adopt.
Not just because "I think she knows money" because, she probably doesn't unless there's some secret intelligence to her I'm yet to be exposed but her fame and wealth make a difference to people who read that tweet.

Even if you don't value a person's opinion, it's still beneficial to THIS community if they think BTC &gt; GBP right?
I honestly don't get why people think I'm being an idiot?
The woman has money and publicity and made a statement that BTC is more stable than GBP so that's only good for us.
I think it's a common idea that bitcoin needs to be accessible to the "idiots" and something like this is gonna help that?
@_date: 2016-07-20 20:08:37
It is as relevant?
My point isn't that Allen's opinion is worth more than Krugman's, but that a high profile person is bringing bitcoin some attention with *what I see* as good publicity.
Krugman's opinion is just as relevant, but negative so if you want to talk about that instead, we can?
@_date: 2016-07-20 18:48:37
I'll agree to disagree.
I think the lolz is more directed towards the GBP, *which* currency is being "lolz"ed at, is open to interpretation I guess.
the situation seems a bit glass half empty, some people ^(just me?) think that people poking fun at the GBP because the underdog btc is passing it is a good thing... then the glass half empty people are just annoyed that Allen is comparing BTC to GBP which must mean she thinks BTC is worthless.
it 'aint and the GBP is a decent currency to be compared to.
