Seriously, where have you been?

2 weeks

I think new nodes may need them to verify old transactions but they can be pruned afterwards. People would also have to know about your particular tx and specifically decode it and view its raw contents, in order to be aware of your info. Blows my mind how researchers would of been able to piece together these 40-80 byte fragments to build CP.
You either would have to be tipped off or been really reaching for something.

So far those questions have been, "Are you interested in my ICO?"
aka, how much money will you give me....
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:46:28
Couldnt individual nodes prune the additional data once arrives to ensure they arnt potentially holding illegal content. The OP_Return data isnt necessary to continue the chain, just extra garbage. Its not like whole images are coming through anyways, someone has to piece it together.

Might as well just apply to all of them. Eventually they will get around to it and you always have a backup exchange to fiat or purchase coins if necessary as well you can take advantage of doubling withdrawal limits. :D

Just my 2 cents, but if you have any debt, why not just pay that off completely? Any stress from that will be gone and you will still keep the majority of your coins. This assumes you have any debt. If not, good on you and keep doing what makes you happy!!

Segwit is already in place and Lightning on the way. LTC community also agreed to double the block size once half capacity is met. This may not happen once LN is in full force.

I guess Localbitcoins could help too? 300 dollars asking is super low as well considering what they were able to encrypt.

Makes the fee increase, they have better chance of finding a block with their asic boost and they still get a beautiful block reward. Making more money is their incentive.

He just really likes calling things scam-coins. I think its his favorite word. If anything, ltc is one of the most fair coins available and is already a majority clone of BTC so devs can immediately start working on LTC when ready to move. Any new work done on LTC and practiced in a real world environment can be ported back to BTC once the miners smarten up. Couldn't ask for a better situation besides activating Segwit now as a software as originally planned.

I believe he's making reference to the spelling error. Liar not lier. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:34:01
Only 166 companies paid? That seems a little low? Maybe the majority of these companies don't even know how to get their hands on bitcoin.

1MB block size to 2MB block size to accommodate more on chain transactions before we hit max transaction limit and start seeing backlogs like btc. The idea is to deal with the issue early before it happens. It may never happen though, if LN gets fleshed out the way we hope.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:18:17
Untouched since Jan 2016? Prob not the best.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:15:27
WOW! You have reliable TB HD for $25 where? I am interested. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:45:52
Litecoin is essentially bitcoin with a few changes. Once lightning is fleshed out on LTC, it will essentially be fleshed out on BTC when you guys are ready to get Segwit. I thought Ethereum was trying to get Raiden going?? Is that the same codebase as LN?
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:39:34
It's not planned to increase every time. It's a condition that if we hit the limit, we increase only to 2MB. Ideally with LN we won't need more than 2MB. With Segwit we already essentially have 2MB and if we double the base we would have 4MB of space available for transactions. With Ltc 2.5 block times we have significantly more transaction space than Btc already.

They called it a User Activated Hard Softfork referring to BIP148. lol

Damn, not even an average of 10% of nodes supporting?

He always seems so happy in either direction. We could learn something from this little guy.
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:39:12
The size is the same. The number of transactions that can fit are different. It is equivalent to a 1.7 to 2MB block size because some data of a transaction is being left out. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:00:25
He likes to live on the edge, just like the rest of us. Hes just always happy about it.
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:52:05
The limit is for verified on chain transactions. Eventually everyone has to send those LN transactions to the chain. If the block size limit is too high, it will become unfeasible for an average Joe to keep their own copy of the block chain at our current storage standards. Maybe a breakthrough in the future will change that.

Bitpay will have to enable Ltc in canada for that to happen. With Segwit potentially coming to btc near August, they may deem Ltc too risky at this point.
