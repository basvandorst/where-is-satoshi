Because noobs are gonna buy on coinbase where it is easy. More advanced users are looking for exchanges with low fees so coinbase tries to cater to both kinds of cliente.

It's possible to add a custom word to your passphrase on the ledger. Then you can save one part of your coins in the newly created address, the rest in the old one.

You didn't need to say it. You implied it. Veganism is an abolishment movement and therefore "extreme".
Yet you wouldn't find issue with abolishment in the case of the other issues I mentioned.

Man that sucks. I hate animal exploitation.

Yeah all those people being vehemently against other morally bad things like rape and infanticide are such fundamentalists. There. That's what you sound like.

How does either of those questions address that it's a shitty thing to do to a bird to tether it to anything?
Also your comment comes off as way more of a outrage as the one you are responding to.

I mean... we literally kill millions of them for our taste buds each week. Do you oppose that as well?

Good luck.

Why can't you store a full pubkey in a cookie though?
And why would you need a pre established secret with the website of you are using pubkey encryption? Isn't that the whole point of the pubkey system, that you are not relying on a secret handshake at the beginning of the first interaction?
Sry if my questions seem stupid, just starting to learn about encryption systems.

How or where do you buy your Bitcoins though? I don't want to use coinbase anymore because of the NYA shenanigans and because of the high fees. I use kraken but I always have to wait for my money to arrive there.

Thanks for the answer, very informative.
What are your thoughts on U2F in constellation with e.g. the Ledger Nano S?

I think Hodor was also a HODLER.

Nope. They should pay for their arrogance regarding the upcoming fork. They won't get any more money of mine and I can only hope lots of people do the same.
