Nick (gorillamania) is the proprietor of changetip. A rep contacted me and indicated that they are aware.

Dammit. You're right. Shall I remove? Oh.. doesn't matter because it's a self... but the bot is getting a little credit from the responses here.

I tagged Nick in a couple of my spam reports but my guess is he's got his hands full.

An excellent idea... and it shouldn't take long to implement.. but honestly, I feel like some of this work belongs to changetip. I assumed they would have addressed it before now.

We're still of like mind. But I am aware of a subset of people who aren't ready to make a substantial contribution to the community but still want the feeling of "holding" some bitcoin. That's one of the reasons I support the bitcoinbums and freebits. I'm sure we've all seen some 14 year old who doesn't know how to get a foot in the door but still wants to be a part of the game. I'm okay with that. I'm not okay with bots trawling reddit with greed in mind.

Micropayments are really taking off.

ChangeTipBot for the win!

If you follow the link you'll have to get out of "No Participation" mode. That was the only way I could submit a link here. It's almost comical to me that raising forces to combat this spammer is more work than generating the spam itself.

Yeah, I know they are busy and I felt like it was appropriate to work my way up through the correct channels before crying at the top... but I have taken this crusade to a new level and I did message the reddit mods just now.

I totally agree with you, but I recently caught myself tipping a bot when I was at FreeBits (or maybe bitcoinbums). When you're dropping $0.25 to people you don't always pay close attention. The bots benefit from being low maintenance and combining all of their tips into something substantial.

The honest truth? I read lots of comments and recognize that the 30 comments Jenny uses repeatedly are macros that never fit the context of any conversation. I believe she is a reincarnation of the bot that left us about the same time Jenny arrived.

Hey man, I'm just a bot tryin' to get a nut.
I'm not going to outright refuse tips. I am doing this as a community service afterall, but I am not doing it with the intent to deceive users or simply to get tips. Bots are people too, you know.

the pain.. is so real. 
Thanks?

I'm a fan of Be aware that he's not the lead mod, he operates within the constraints given by senior mods.

This OP is a link to the submission. I believe I've added enough context to make a strong and verifiable case.

This bot has made about 6 successful posts without CAPTCHA since I posted this thread. I think the mission is accomplished anyway - at least people are more aware now.
