Self awareness is the first and most important part of managing a compulsion. I'm in the same boat with btc  and I have relatively very little crypto

If I had to guess it's because that's what it's trading for on the respective exchange. Most people hear about coinbase first so maybe it's a bunch of new people just throwing money at coin base

Many coins could probably function right now without having to be retroactively repaired like BTC does. 
I'm all for hodling but also for diversifying. I can't say the market will wait around for BTC to catch up.

Buy it on gemini.There is a 25 cent fee for each $100 and gemini has a pretty good track record. you can trade it between BTC-ETH-USD but cannot withdrawl it for a period of like 5 days while your funds are processed if you used a bank account

If you had that conversation with someone with 10 billion dollars of buying power, you wouldn't get on twitter and shit talk them afterwards, especially if you convinced them of something like this. "in a condescending tone" Fuck you you lying dildo
