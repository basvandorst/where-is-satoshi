it works for all transactions (also from LT) you'll find in the transaction tab

Ignore that, it likely won't work, as mycelium is not associating your localtrader ID directly to an bitcoin address.
I’d try the following:
1) Check what Address your localtrader ID uses by going into LT and under the tab **My Info** it is displayed beneath your trader Name.
2) Now we want to get the private key for the Address associated with your Local Trader ID. Visit  (I recommend to do this on an **offline computer**, you can save the homepage as it is by using rightclick/Save page as and open it from USB stick or the like).
3) Enter your mnemonic into the **BIP39 Mnemonic** Field.
4) Take the **BIP32 Tab** and set the derivation path to: **m/44'/0'/0’**  (The path m/44'/0'/0’/0 found on that page is for iOS Wallet, not Android)
It should start to calculate the first 20 Addresses connected to your mnemonic, search (CTRL+F) for your LocalTrader Address and save away your private key. You can import it manually by typing or generate an QR Code of it, so you can import it more handy in the future when changing your HD wallet. make sure to import it into your accounts prior to starting up LocalTrader, it will then find your associated address and should ask you if you'd like to use it.
If you are willing to start over in LocalTrader:
In the Accounts tab:
Add Key -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Generate new random key (bottom) -&gt; use -&gt; Find it in your Accounts tab under *Other Accounts* -&gt; select it -&gt; create backup
This way it will produce a single key backup for you, you can use this to set up local trader on easy to restore single address.

Coins are in a multi-sig address (starting with an 3) but in full control of coinapult.

what makes it different from a trezor or ledger? 
@_date: 2015-10-12 16:50:49
what is the right spot on the card?
(e.g. Top left corner with wifi symbol on ledger logo side)
I've also had to try it over and over when testing
@_date: 2015-10-12 20:01:00
so it does not make a difference how i hold my card, as in, the whole card works as an antenna?
@_date: 2015-10-12 19:57:20
will see what i can do :)
@_date: 2015-10-15 00:42:06
yes, all the addresses you use are derived from a master key, you would have to import you master **public** key into mycelium, it would then show you all transactions of the coinkite account

you might want to stay away from alternative app stores, as you can't be sure you are downloading the version signed by mycelium or one that has been altered with.
@_date: 2015-10-18 22:02:50
In Accounts tab press "Add Key" at top right corner. Press "Advanced", Press "Scan", scan.

We use staged roll-outs, so when we release an update to the PlayStore it will not reach everyone at once but in increments.
The notification that an update is available reaches almost all users though, which is why you see the update screen.
You can there choose to ignore the update, if it reaches you via PlayStore it is likely going to be updated automatically anyway. We also have a button redirecting the user to the PlayStore (where he won't be able to see the update yet if he is not part of the stage already rolled out - i know that's confusing) or the mycelium Homepage where they can directly load a signed version of the wallet.
In both ways (direct download from mycelium and auto-update playstore) no app data should be lost. The only way to loose data is to uninstall the app without making a backup prior, which although we encourage users to do one, a lot seems to be skipping on :/

When releasing a new version, we change the number on our backend, so your wallet will notice if a newer version has been released since the last sync.
Since we also use staged roll-outs of our software it can happen, that you are not within the group which can already see the new update within PlayStore. So you won't find the new version when checking the update using PlayStore button.
This only leaves you with the option of upgrading using the signed copy which you can download from mycelium.com or to ignore the update, it will become available to you through the PlayStore later anyway.
If dialog urges you about new mycelium update but you can't see it in the playstore: the staged roll-out likely hasn't reached you yet, either update via direct download over mycelium.com or ignore update and wait for it to be delivered by PlayStore itself.

he kind of did
@_date: 2015-10-15 00:11:00
did you only add the single address as watch-only?
likely you had an output of 7$ on that address, which you consumed in your transaction, creating one with .33 on that same address and 6.66 on your change address. it is unknown to mycelium and it recognizes that 6.66 are leaving this address

as malleability does not affect if the funds arrive this seems like a strange argument
