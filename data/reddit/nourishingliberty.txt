Hey Guys! Thanks for all the great comments and advice!
I think it's great the way this community crowdsources solutions. Clearly, my experience is not an isolated one and I wrote about it to let others know that this is happening and hopefully some amazing minds will begin working on tangible solutions. I certainly see what I could have done differently to take further precautions. However, I have spoken to many others who had those precautions in place and still had coins stolen. Obviously, I should not have had so many coins in one place and I knew that. I did not have enough urgency about it and that is why I am encouraging others to take it more seriously. 
I'm not asking for sympathy or coins so there is no need to call this a scam. I have a large presence online so I assure you I am a real person. :) Since this is not an isolated incident, I'm adding my voice to the others who have had similar experiences. The helpful comments are great and provide real actions people can take. Thanks for that. I'm a strong supporter of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies and I like to see these issues ironed out for wider adoption.
Here's a link to the published article.

Thanks! Sorry for your loss as well.

For anyone interested in or involved in the intersection of bitcoin and how it can help our farmers and other food providers.

Yes. I agree. Coinbase has those claims but with such wide disclaimers. I consider myself the average user. This is all a steep learning curve (and a steep cost) but clearly, this experience, and others who have had similar experiences, shows the need for suggestions such as yours to be implemented.

Thanks. I agree and am learning a lot from this process (mistake). Thanks for your sympathies.

For sure! It's great to have the community here to crowd source tangible solutions! Thanks!

Thanks. I agree. Using, storing and safeguarding Bitcoins has a bit of a learning curve and now I see all those unlocked doors. I hope that my mistake and all this amazing input from the community helps others not make the same mistake. It's kind of awesome how this community crowdsources solutions. :) Thanks for your sympathy.

Thanks for reading and offering your statistical analysis on the likelihood of a mother with 5 kids holding bitcoin. I wrote the article for my blog to encourage others to NOT make the same mistakes I've made. And to process what happened so that I'm not constantly dwelling on the loss but am able to see a constructive way forward. I definitely see and take responsibility for the things I could have done differently. And, I see the weaknesses in the system that need ironing out prior to widespread adoption. As a proponent of Bitcoin and digital currencies, I think these kinds of mistakes are important to share and discuss so that we can work on improvements. Again, thanks for reading. Here is a link to my blog where I write about food freedom and Bitcoin. Those are my kiddos and you are welcome to google my name for more info if you still have trouble understanding that a mom with 5 kids can be interested and involved with Bitcoin. :)

I am not asking for or suggesting that anyone send money. With the amazing support networks in this community, I would be thrilled to see ideas for real solutions for average users. I know that digital currencies currently take exorbitantly more effort to understand and use. The way this crowd implements solutions to known problems is inspiring and encouraging. I hope that my story can help identify just how widespread this issue might be and generate a conversation about solutions and alternatives.

Thanks! I appreciate it! And I agree that this kind of issue needs to be dealt with before it will be adopted widely.
