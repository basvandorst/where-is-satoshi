Ah, apologies if that seems pushy or something. Genuinely just wanted a new account strictly for crypto stuff and it seemed to make sense. I can go back to the drawing board if you think it's wrong.

Hey, are you saying that's a problem? I was under the impression that as an active community participant i'm well within my rights to share some of my articles every now and then. (just from reading reddit's self-promotion guidelines, correct me if i'm wrong)

Thank you, really appreciate that :) I'll give it more thought

Thanks for your feedback. Building a mobile app for the site is definitely a goal for the future.  
Just published an article with an editor's take with the aim of providing original educational content. If you ever have time to give it a glance I'd really appreciate your thoughts on whether this addresses some of your concerns. [  
Regarding self-promotion, you're absolutely right. I definitely want this account to be an active community member, and will make sure not to just post links to the site. Thanks again.

Valid point, 'debate' is definitely an exaggeration. There is zero chance this happens.

not a trader, but shorting something that's down over 85% does not seem a smart move haha

Can you give some more specific examples of what you mean by manage your personal economy/ interfaces between crypto and daily life. Very interesting.

Would direct source links as well as to the site be an improvement? The purpose of the site was to provide content for people who don't want to have to read the full article, so you can get the crux of a news story at a glance. It's meant to be a supplementary service as well as the existing news sites, not compete with them for traffic.
We're also writing our own content that has more of a tech focus, short write ups of dev logs etc, so can make that our focus if necessary. Cheers for sharing your opinion.  
Edit - what do you think if we gave an editors critical take on the story, a few sentences about the validity of the argument/ reliability of the source. Genuinely trying to improve this site.

Ah ok, great to see these services grow even with the current fees

You're right, 'discussion' would have been a better, still an overstatement, will try to provide better content moving forwards.
