It's not wasted, it is invested into the immutable security of an asset that already has a market cap almost as high as Denmarks GDP (~70% of it as of today) and I assume mining is almost as difficult as it needs to be so even when btc gets bigger, the energy investment will not.
bitcoins energy consumption is not particularly high, it is particularly transparent.

Don't you have to ensure the package somehow if you send a pound of gold via mail? That will cost a bit and sending it from your home to mine might take 3 weeks depending on your continent. Fees for three-week-btc-transactions are super duper low.
Moving btc is a bitch right now for sure but arguing Its harder then moving gold is not fair.

Coinbase is much more beginner friendly. Especially if you don't have a trading background but you'll pay higher fees.
Good strategy if you are new is to buy via Coinbase. Read up on crypto and watch tutorials about gdax and then switch to that "more advanced but cheaper" platform

Spamming does increase fees but it also reduces the amount of fees a miner can collect. ATM that's a risk free trade off for them since the block reward is so high. They can always spam but in the future there will be a profitability cap to spam. They can't just spam more and more

I'd assume that once LN is established and even used by vendors globally settling will be a very very rare event. I can't back that claim up with anything though 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:58:20
It's "ok" if settlements are expensive on chain if what they settle is 100.000 LN transactions reduced down to a single blockchain transaction. This will reduce whatever fees you have by factor 100.000

They are not halving all the coins. Just how many new get created.
There are currently about 16mil coins and to reach 21mil new coins are created (currently about 12 every ten minutes) but over time less and less new coins will be mined (halving every 4 years)

These contracts settle in cash. The exchange does not actually own the btc for those contracts so they have to pair up long and short positions. It will never happen that everyone goes short btc, it will always be half long interest half short interest.

You would never need to allow for direct transaction. Just **always** use the escrow. As long as the merchant behaves and customer and merchant agree the escrow does not even need to be aware of the trade. Only when there is disagreement you will need the escrow to break the tie for a fee that disincentivizes both parties from arguing 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:52:19

Before storing a lot of btc in your wallet store just a small one. Then test if you would be able to recover your wallet by resetting your device. If you are able to that means you did nothing wrong when writing down your seed and you can feel confident storing more money. I did three dry runs bevor moving my funds

@_date: 2017-11-28 19:23:34
I can't back this up with data but I don't think that's an issue.
As for accessibility: you need a computer or smartphone to conveniently hold and trade bitcoin and there aren't a lot of places in the world where people don't have smartphones yet.
As for awareness and knowledge: bitcoin is so much more important to people in those destable countries then to you and me that I'm pretty sure a lot of them use it for a while or will soon.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:55:28
It's not moving any coins but it will have an effect on it. (As media coverage has an effect on btc price without moving coins).
Some expect the bitcoin price to be less volatile if whales with actual coins will be able to hedge against their positions. Time will tell

Couldn't you argue the other way around too? If everyone sells his fiat for btc the value of fiat would crash after $50T got exchanged ? (It would feel like btc market cap just increases but only because we use fiat as anchor)

It's gone forever. Theoretically all remaining coins equally increase in value a bit to compensate for the lost coins due to a shift in supply and demand 
Since you can break down a bitcoin into almost arbitrary small numbers this should have no effect on liquidity or whatever
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:52:51
**IF** bitcoin becomes what it tries to be it should be a few hundred thousand per coins in a couple of years. If 500bucks don't kill you, read up on the technology and reconsider buying some.

@_date: 2017-11-30 02:42:36
No they don't. If you find someone who goes into a long contract and someone else that goes short with the same amount you can pair them up. ( if prices go up the bear has to pay the bull, if prices go down vice verca ) hence you created a market without anyone ever owning actual btc. This only works however when there are equal amounts of bulls and bears. If everyone would go short the exchange literally couldn't give out contracts, they would stop trading **or** buy btc themselves and become a market maker but so far they didn't plan to do that and I doubt they will in the foreseeable future.

It's like arguing in 1994 a letter is more convenient to send then an email: you don't need an expansive machine and you can send it to everyone, not just those few with an internet connection and also you can put drawings in it.
Yes in 94 email may have been less convenient then letter but at that point it already fixed all the substantial shortcomings of physical mail (speed, cost). 
It is 94 for bitcoin right now and fees might be high but it already fixed the underlying weaknesses of fiat. Now you only have to wait for 2004

To my understanding this agreement was reached to prevent the blocksize increase introduced in bitcoin cash. So the the BCH fork made that agreement somewhat obsolete.
It was only introduced so that big-block proponents (that coincidentally were anti segwit) would agree to a compromise. But they didn't. They forked off to a big block no-segwit chain so why still honoring that compromise?
