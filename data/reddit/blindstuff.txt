At what point does it become taxable? 
Is the value of the BTC in relation to the $ taxable or only when its converted back to $? Seems that due to volatility the amount you'd pay is highly dependant on cutoff date.

If you think this is a win for crypto currencies you have not been paying attention to Venezuela.

Don't celebrate what you don't understand. Venezuelas situation is incredibly complex.
While the use of Bitcoin to circumvent currency exchange control and value fixation of the Bolivar to the dollar is a great example of a positive use case for Crypto through AirTM, this is not. 
The government in Venezuela has  forced adoption of the Petro (their own shitcoin, with value tied to oil and fixed against the dollar). Many stores then started to accept other crypto just to not have to take the useless Petro. This speaks basically nothing about adoption.
Here's an interesting podcast on AirTM that sheds some info on the reality of the situation there.

You don't really get this:






The Petro is super negative for the crypto world, a coin that's just a pseudo-crypto-bond vs a currency emited by a government run by drug dealers. 
There are better examples of government involvement that are actually positive.

While they may have happened I don't know of any first hand stories, I do know of several people on a first degree connection basis that have had their mining equipment confiscated due to it being illegal. Only for it to be used by people who are in close collaboration with the government. [This guy]( is a government paid "journalist", that him with his completely illegal farm, but it doesn't matter, he's well connected so no one can go after him. The caption of the tweet is "at my active s9 farm - suffer government opposers"


Yes. The Petro is not even really a currency, its a "crypto-bond", its non-minable, tied to the value of oil and payable by the Venezuelan government. Its a way for a $ short government plagued by sanctions to access the world market, Crypto is not a priority to them at all, just a nice unregulated medium through which to circumvent they restrictions in place.

I'm from Venezuela (lived 20+ years, no longer there), I believe immensely in the future of Bitcoin against Fiat Currency, however, while it did play a role, blaming the situation in Venezuela only on Fiat money is grossly shortsighted.

Venezuelan here, happy the US is sanctioning this. You should read up on what really going on in Venezuela before writing comments like this.

If you invest in this you're quite simply stupid. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:02:52
My bad. I'm kinda touchy with the weird praise some people here give Venezuela with no clue of the real situation.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:05:07
I get that some uninformed dumbass will post this kinda of stuff from time to time, but the fact that it gets upvoted is mindboggling. 
US Sanctions came into play way after Venezuela's economy was doomed through Chavez's actions.
Persecution of dissent, economic control, currency exchange limitations, price regulation, expropriation of private property and enterprise all played much more important roles in the collapse of Venezuela than any foreign nation.
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:12:25
I believe the whole point of the Petro, from the perspective of the Venezuelan government is to bypass sanctions and using the USD since they are basically broke and locked away from a significant number of deals. The whole crypto-thing is just a convenient way of doing it, but by issuing it backed by the value of the barrel of oil its more like a crypto-bond than an actual currency.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:09:32
Indeed, the government just issued an economic reform by eliminating three zero's from the currency in order to mask rampant inflation. 
Here's what's going to sound crazy and why Venezuela can get so much use of bitcoin: bitcoin is actually more stable than the Venezuelan Bolivar and provides free access to the outside world.
If you're not aware the Venezuelan government restricts anyone other than those in direct authorization and in limited quotas to buy foreign currencies.
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:09:33
Why do I have to keep posting this?
Venezuela + BTC = Good | There are actually people using this for real life stuff.
Venezuela + Petro = Scam | It is just a government issued pseudo-crypto-bond that is tied to the value of oil that almost no one can use.
The only reason crypto is relevant in Venezuela is because the government imposed strict currency exchange controls, praising them for petro goes against what most people in this subreddit *say* they stand for.

You're right, I guess my point is why bring petro up in the article along side the massive buy of bitcoin. It seems to say "they're buying bitcoin and now launched their own coin" instead of reflecting that the two are not related.
