I don't want bitcoin to be accessible to every big corporation out there. I like it to stay just the way it is. Besides, looking at it from Apple's position, what if Bitcoin loses popularity, or gets shut down? What if an even better Bitcoin comes along?

If only a couple people build them, then sure. Otherwise, NO. All it will accomplish is crashing the value of each bitcoin even further. Remember, all the bitcoins out there all together are only worth 42mil. If you want to get into this kind of thing, by all means, but my advice is to do it as a hobby, not a business investment. At least with a GPU, you can still turn around and play D3 or something with your card anyways, so there is no need to pay it off. I don't think FPGAs are quite as versatile.

Why would a merchant need this service though? Isn't it fairly simple for anyone to accept bitcoin payments themselves? It would be nice to see a bitcoin debit card.

Neither, I feel that the price is going to hold stable at around $5/per for some time. Merchants don't like a volatile price either, so we are starting to see larger amounts of money on both sides holding it there.

Wow, fuck you too Sam Biddle and Gizmodo.

Tried to sell bitcoin on Ebay. Most of my buyers tried to do chargebacks. I found out that if you get caught selling bitcoin, Paypal will freeze your account.

I learned this the hard way. :(

I tried to make a taxi company integrate bitcoin, but the main problem we had was that it is very difficult to use a currency that can be worth 20% more or less from one week to another. I don't care how much one BTC is worth so much as I care how stable the price is. Until it stabilizes, I don't think many companies are going to use it. Also, I see deflation as being another problem with bitcoin. If there is no inflation, no one is going to want to spend or invest any BTC.

Bitcoins were $4.37 when I bought them. They still have a LONG way down to go before I start losing money. Granted I probably should have sold at $250, but I'm still OK with making a 1500% profit (if I wanted to sell right now - which I'm not going to)

I just want to price to be stable. I can't really buy or sell anything until that happens.

Almost 2 million dollars for a ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. :(
