Yet. 
Visa has had decades to build and improve their infrastructure. Bitcoin has been around for less than 10 years. Give it time.

I'd recommend ordering directly from Ledger, or one of their resellers at  for complete peace of mind, but, it _should_ be fine. Keep in mind that Ledger don't "seal" their devices, as it's a [futile means of protection]( If it's already been activated, be sure to reset the device (enter pin wrong 3+ times) so to create a new 24 word phrase (ie, don't just use a pin that he gives you, as he could have an identical device, restored to the same seed).
If you want to really verify the security integrity, take a look at 
In regards to power, it doesn't use batteries, no. It's powered completely via USB.

For that kind of value, I'd heavily recommend a hardware wallet, such as the Ledger Nano S. They retail for less than $100, which is a very reasonable price when you're storing $5000+ worth of Bitcoin. Just use a secure pin (I'd recommend all 8 digits), and backup the seed phrase in somewhere like a small fireproof/waterproof safe/lockbox.
If you really don't want to use a hardware wallet, just store your paper wallet in a similar secure location, and that'll work fine, albeit just slightly more inconvenient.
