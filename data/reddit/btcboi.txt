Yes, they are just trying to discredit BitCoin and play to the fear of Joe Public.

It's not really free money. I'll try to explain as I understand it ..
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:44:22
no not at all. Just free coins

It is a very difficult thing for me to explain on here. Especially after 3 glasses of Shiraz but I'll try. The coins are "mined". This will probably be wrong but someone might step in and explain better.
The mining analogy is used because coins are easy to find at first but get harder and harder to find. Like gold or silver.
25 Bitcoins are generated every 10 minutes until about 2021.
The way they are generated is by finding the answer to a very difficult hashing algorithm. People use their GPU's to try to solve these calculations. Pools also operate where people join forces to find the coins and share the profit.
If too many people suddenly start mining the difficulty of the calculations is increased so that it is always only 25 bitcoins per 10 minutes. Every 4 years the number of Bitcoins per 10 mins is halved and difficulty is always increased to make it harder to mine the coins.
Therefore, it's not really free money. People are dedicating hardware and electricity costs to solve these equations and earn coins.
Sites like the ones I posted do give small amounts of bitcoins away because they make money on advertising.
Also, many people who were early adopters have thousands of coins and like to give coins away to increase adoption.
At this time you can sell a bitcoin for about $90. If they take off each coin could be worth thousands or even millions
I hope this at least puts you onto the right things to google :)
i'm going to regret posting this. My attempt at explaining BitCoin Mining haha

He's right about the security aspect. Hackers must be targeting wallets in their droves

It's a long story but the short answer is that you can trade for goods online with them. Check this out, but be warned. Once you learn about BitCoin you don't do much else :):

Hear Hear. Great post
@_date: 2013-04-06 01:40:43
You have a point there. Most people I talk to haven't heard of it. I retract the comment!!!
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:44:58
Thanks. It all helps

I hope I can be solid member of the sub reddit man. I can probably help newcomers get started earning/mining coins
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:31:54
Good call haha
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:43:28
I'm hoping this is the case and I guess it is.
