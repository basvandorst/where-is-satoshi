Eliminating ASICs will only lead to huge malware networks dominating, and incentivizing outrageous new superworms to infect billions of devices.
ASICs are the best thing that could have ever happened to cryptocurrency.
It doesn't have to be SHA256, but it should remain something that can eventually be done on ASICs. Trust me. Please.

It makes way, **way** more sense that it's just a miner gaming wallet fee calculations. For anyone else, it would be costing a fortune, and it's obviously only having subtle effects. 
Occam's razor. 
Edit: this is literally costing more than $1,000 **per hour, and has been going on for months**. I don't care what kind of voodoo you might believe Roger Ver has - that would really be just too much.

That's a separate issue. Opening a channel is not what I have concerns about. Who controls the hubs that those channels route through, on the other hand, and what regulations their owners and users will be subjected to, *are*. And I think that's an extremely valid concern to have.

You *do* realize that what you call a "51% attack" is actually just how Nakamoto Consensus works, and has always worked?
If you disagree, then please describe an instance of Nakamoto Consensus that you would *not* classify as a "51% attack?"
Also please bear in mind that I am no fan of BU or its "emergent consensus" model, at this point, and fear that it will be just about equally disastrous as Blockstream's plans for bitcoin. My own preference is for a dynamic/elastic max blocksize, and I hope to facilitate that as the compromise that both sides can agree to.

Peter, surely you know about XThin and Compact Blocks, by now. That is a thoroughly solved problem - bandwidth bursts to transmit blocks are obsolete, and have been for a long time, now.

That's all besides the point. Mining should not be something that can be done without the device owner's knowledge or consent.

That may be true, but then you might as well just be using ASICs anyway. But most of the proposals I've seen from those who hate ASICs are for CPU-forward algos that don't work on GPUs. 
Edit: the other thing to consider is that pretty much any algo that runs on GPUs is one that can, and will, have ASICs built for it.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:49:49
It wouldn't have to rely on kludgy hacks like people transferring their funds to anyone-can-spend UTXOs, it could actually fix quadratic hashing and tx malleability for *existing* balances instead of just new, SW-enabled balances, it could avoid the need for a whole separate data block that adds a bunch of unneeded overhead, it could exist with probably less than half the complexity and lines of code of the current implementation (which also makes it easier to audit and test, so that's a big security benefit), and more. That's just off the top of my head. 
SW was never originally intended to be a soft fork. Luke Dashjr just figured out a way to kludge it as one at the last minute, and Core ran with it.  
@_date: 2017-03-04 03:02:43
You're going to have to back up those claims, because they don't make any sense to me.
How would BU cause "mining centralization?" Every ASIC on earth today would still work fine after a fork. XThin allows tx data to flow without big block bursts, meaning that large blocks do *not* pose a significant orphan threat as they once did. That whole line of reasoning just isn't real, anymore.
And how would it facilitate a "51% attack," or are you just maliciously and inaccurately calling the Nakamoto Consensus mechanism such a thing?
I do honestly want to learn about these issues, so if you're willing to explain them, I would actually be grateful.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:14:21
That's exactly my point. It *must* be a miner, and bloating fee calculation figures is motive enough for them without this absurd conspiracy theory about it being a BU "attack," that was seemingly so ineffective as an "attack" that nobody even noticed it for almost four months.
I can't believe I'm even needing to argue this - are people really *this* committed to petty spite?
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:52:25
LN and other solutions aren't even fully *designed* yet, and the LN routing problem might not even be *possible* to solve (we still don't know) - shouldn't we wait to know where we're going before we commit ourselves down that road? Activating SW now isn't going to help anyone design LN any faster. We can wait until it's ready.

The payer can steal the money back after "paying" at any time, until the recipient moves their money to a different address (which just brings us back to the same problem we started with).
This is one of the major problems that bitcoin was created to solve. This is not a very useful idea, unfortunately.
This thread does, however, demonstrate how ridiculous Core's unwillingness to enable on-chain scaling has been. I wish there was a better option than BU to move forward with, like one that used a dynamic/elastic max blocksize.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:40:25
I mean, moving information distribution to a wider, cheaper medium like the internet (analgous to LN), after a more trusted/slower system like print (analgous to on-chain), has definitely hurt many print firms' bottom lines. Jihan's is an extremely reasonable concern, and to downplay it is to insist on irrational dogma instead of rational contingency planning. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:12:03
**What** "cut down on spam?" It sure wasn't some contribution from Core. Rather, it was the natural increase in bitcoin adoption that filled the temporary and years-old 1 MB blocksize that caused fees to rise and price out cheaper transactions.
But wait - which is it? Because much of the Core crowd cries day in and out about how the network is experiencing a "spam" attack, and that *that* is why the blocks are full! And of course such an "attack" would only exist as a response to Core's *inaction* on meaningful scaling solutions. So is there *more* spam now, or *less* spam? And is it rational to support a belief that requires oneself to believe both at the same time?
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:03:01
I agree completely, but I really wish you'd drop the patronizing condescension. If you read my posting history, you'll see that I actually share that exact same concern, and have even made anxious posts about it on reddit hoping to have those concerns alleviated (they were not). I also have great reservations about BU, bearing in mind the exact mechanic that you cite here. At the same time, though, I think gradual blocksize increases are precisely what the network needs right now. My personal preferred route to get there would be a dynamic blocksize limit based on recent historical block fullness, and I still hold out hope that such a solution can be the compromise that both Core and BU supporters can agree to. But both sides have become incredibly dogmatic, vitriolic and frankly, deceptive and dishonest about the threats and mechanics we're facing, which makes that more difficult.
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:30:25

@_date: 2017-03-10 07:48:38

Why is this a rational path, again?
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:55:03
And more specifically, deterministic builds using Gitian or other frameworks, which bitcoin has been a pioneer in for a while, now, as well as proper digital signatures on the downloads. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:56:37
BU is **not** a dynamic/elastic max blocksize as I hope to see. In the last week I have actually changed from being a total BU supporter to being extremely wary of BU's plan, mostly due to the very reasonable and pretty objective points raised by pieces like [this one]( and my own realization that miners' idea of a "good" blocksize would be way, **way** bigger than users' idea of the same (since it's miners' actual *business* to run hardware that supports their blocks).
What I mean by a dynamic/elastic blocksize is something like the proposals that have been raised that float the max blocksize against the historical size of the last 2016 blocks or some other similar value. I honestly think it's the by far the best scaling model to use, at this point.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:39:08


*"Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.* ***Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism****."*
\- Satoshi Nakamoto (emphasis added)


Nice attempt to derail, there. But here's the thing: I'm not looking for some "all on-chain scaling utopia." I just think it's seriously misguided to totally disrupt the basic functionality of the system when it still only has a fraction of a percent of its eventual user base. The entire point of the block reward is to put off tx fees until the system is widely adopted and well bootstrapped. If you can explain why that's somehow a bad idea, I'll gladly give you a cookie.

@_date: 2017-03-01 18:43:58
Pretty much nobody is arguing against 2nd layer scaling solutions, eventually. The debate is about a block size increase before versus after. If you honestly believe what you just wrote, then you have been outright lied to, plainly, and you should hold the liars that deceived you accountable. Over on the other sub, people are nearly all in favor of LN, MW, and other solutions, in the long term (like once they're actually *designed,* for one important thing...).
Also, this part of this discussion started about how miners earn revenue, and it seems like you're somehow now arguing *against* miner revenue? This is really pretty ridiculous; there's not much point in debating against such absurdity.   
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:25:38
Which makes more money... A single five-star restaurant that serves expensive meals to a hundred guests per night, or a fast food chain that sells a billion cheap meals per year?
Increasing the block size means an increase in fee revenue. The economics of it are pretty obvious if you consider it rationally. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:16:49
Yes, which is why Reddit has a fascinating and largely effective upvote/downvote mechanism. And yet, for whatever reason, this sub demands an entirely different system that deliberately makes downvoted content *more* visible. What's up with that?

So all these transactions in the mempool just appeared there on their own, replicated thousands of times over across nearly every full node, without any need for bandwidth, eh?
Sure, it's not quite as bad as having them in the blockchain itself, but it's still consuming real bandwidth, and not a negligible amount, either.
What are you not understanding, here?

The first scenario is actually not much of an issue, but the second (a Median EB Attack) definitely is, as far as I understand.
The first isn't an issue for two reasons:
1. It's extremely unlikely that miners would ever vacilate enough to cause a minority PoW chain to overtake a majority PoW one (especially if the divergence lasts more than a day or so), because this would be extremely risky and cost a huge amount of money/opportunity.
2. Even if the old chain *did* start to make a comeback, all it takes is a simple "InvalidateBlock" RPC command to render it a total non-issue for that client. That command, or its equivalent,, could also be hard-coded into a client eventually. Now, this is obviously *not* ideal, by any stretch, for a lot of reasons, namely that it violates Bitcoin's founding principle that "highest total work = valid chain" and that it becomes an arbitrary, political control on the network, plus it might pose issues for bitcoin businesses to accomodate (although this is less likely than you might think, since it would surely be discussed in advance).
So, there are definitely problems with BU, but it's important to consider them objectively.

While that's true, it's mixed at best, since LN also makes transacting less convenient (by requiring funds locked into channels), requiring users to monitor the network at all times (or pay someone to), etc.
There is essentially no reasonable comparison to the WWW to be made, I am sorry. It's simply not accurate, or rational.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:33:29


Is it even possible to know that? The best and most fraud-proof means to evaluate actual support is with miner hashpower, and BU has pretty much been matched with SW for weeks, now. And if AntPool really is going to go for BU, then it would *definitely* appear that Unlimited has significantly more "consensus" behind it. It would certainly have the Nakamoto Consensus in its favor, which is the fundamental innovation of bitcoin and the thing that makes the entire system work... 
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:25:57
Very interesting; thank you very much.
In learning these and other details about BU's design, as well through some good discussions and critical thought on the matter both here and on I think I've actually come to dislike BU's proposal as much as Core's. What a terrible position to be in.
I wish the idea of a dynamic/elastic max blocksize had gained more traction. I truly believe something in that vein is the way forward - and while I previously felt it was a forgone *ideal,* I now fear that it may in fact be the only way to avoid disaster. Terrible, truly.

A better analogy is how news sites on the web (like LN, a cheaper and wider information distribution network) have largely replaced demand for printed news publications (like on-chain txes, a slower, more expensive, more trusted/secure model with greater logistical handicaps), and now those print publications (like our hypothetical, future miners) are struggling.
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:49:57
Well, *whose* "eventual plan anyway?" Because there are several, and the form of that increasing blocksize is very different between them all.
Also, in my opinion, instituting a hardcoded maximum is a dreadful mistake, as we will just be having this debate *again* (ugh) when it comes time to raise that artificial and totally speculative limit. A big part of why I favor an elastic limit is that it still keeps the size from growing too quickly (and can even shrink it, if there's less block data), and we will never (theoretically) have to mess with it again. It also allows for a reasonable fee market while also relieving pressure when fees get to be excessive.
@_date: 2017-03-08 19:27:48
An amazingly good point! Very thought provoking, and a true concern, indeed!
I can fortunately think of one decent incentive against that behavior, though, but I'm not sure if it's enough - with XThin or Compact Blocks, all those self-generated spam txes would have to be suddenly broadcast once the block is mined, which would be not only highly unusual but would put that miner at risk of having their block orphaned. So there would indeed be some cost, but it will take some figuring to determine just how much.
It's also worth considering that newly-mined blocks that have *lots* of never-before-seen txes are pretty easy to identify and stick out quite a bit, and could potentially be deliberately orphaned by other miners or not relayed by users, though this would need some development and again, becomes somewhat political.
All told, an interesting thing to consider! I'll have to mull on it for a while, and I may get back to you.

Even every single honest bitcoin users on Earth can't compete with that - the owner of those zombie machines would instantly also own bitcoin, hands down, with essentially nothing we could do about it. And the system would fall.

@_date: 2017-03-08 19:09:58
There's pretty effective protection against that - it would cost a **lot** in tx fees. And since an elastic limit would shrink after the attack finished, it would have to be perpetual. The fact that spam attacks are *expensive* is one of the fundamental security properties of bitcoin, and a big part of the brilliance of its design. If we require ourselves to design spam attack solutions *beyond* simply making them very expensive, not only does it become an extremely political task, but I would say that it expresses that the bitcoin model itself is fundamentally broken - and I can't imagine that either of us would agree with that!

That is completely untrue and whoever told you tha is outright lying to you and hoping to manipulate your opinion.
It's right there in the Whitepaper, and is immediately evident to anyone who thinks about it honestly - the only thing any hard fork needs, ever, is a majority of the total hash rate. That's all.
Bitcoin **literally is** a consensus mechanism. That's its whole Earth shattering innovation. Finding "consensus" outside of the obvious and secure method that is integral to bitcoin is to take a massive step back, in terms of progress **and** security. Remember that without PoW, such "consensus" is entirely, 100% vulnerable to Sybil attacks and paid actors. Satoshi solved those problems in 2008.

@_date: 2017-06-05 14:12:48


There is literally nothing more elegant and well tested than simply increasing the blocksize outright. Segwit as a soft fork is a really awkward and complicated, kludgy piece of code.
Malleability is a dramatically lower priority and it doesn't make sense to lump it together with a scaling solution, period, especially when it adds thousands of lines of complex and patented code.
There's also the fact that segwit blocks can end up being 4 MB for only a 1.7 MB effective size, which is like the *opposite* of scaling. And that ratio holds, so a 2 MB base blocksize can yield 8 MB of segwit+block data, and so on. The whole thing makes no sense - if the concern is that nodes don't have the capability to handle more throughput (which is silly enough to begin with), then segwit is *obviously* a terrible solution. Never mind that average bandwidth and storage costs have halved at least twice since this debate began, and yet nobody seems to adjust their voodoo "centralization" math.
I could go on, but it won't matter in this echo chamber. I hope that some of the newbies here find more open forums where freedom of speech and ideas are valued.     
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:51:28
No, I'm not forgetting them at all - those supposed risks have just been wildly overblown by some people.
Consider that in just the last 3 years that the crusade against bigger blocks has been waged, bandwidth and storage costs and capacity have easily quadrupled. So why not move to 4 MB blocks and have the same "decentralization" parameters as we did back then, when the network worked just fine? And why not implement measures that would allow similar catchup in the future, as technology improves?
The only response to this I've gotten is nonsense about quadratic hashing, which isn't even real since literally every big block client proposal has a 1 MB tx size limit. So seriously, why are we shooting ourselves in the foot, here?
When a website becomes outrageously popular, it scales up its backbone capacity - it doesn't ask its users to start getting its content with BitTorrent instead.
Of course there is some small risk, just like anything. Transacting money on computers in general carries some inherent risk. So does shaking someone's hand when you greet them. It doesn't mean that we should live in terror and stand in the way of serious improvements.  
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:24:59

Uhhhh... Actually, they did precisely that.

Now we're upgrading to fiber optics, which is effectively dealing with other physical wire restrictions at higher speeds.
So actually, the truth is the total opposite of what you're saying. HTML v5 didn't get us to megabit speeds...


Define "centralization" and describe how you measure it, please. If you cannot measure a quantity, much less define it, then it's useless. And I don't mean that to be cheeky - that's true scientific fact. You need to evaluate what you mean by that, or it can remaiin a nebulous boogeyman for all time.


Why would a simple blocksize increase to the equivalent of what we had two years ago (since bandwidth and storage have gone way up since then) magically cause problems today? And furthermore, why are you not concerned about the centralization of Lightning hubs, which is much more plausible than what you're describing, and potentially much more harmful?

"Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. **Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.**"

That is literally describing a hard fork. It's right there. It's the conclusion of the document, for pete's sake.


No, but it is integral to the design of literally all cryptocurrencies, and if you try to go against that, well, you might as well be shouting at clouds.


Of course not. If people want to stay on a chain with minimal security that can be 51% attacked at any moment, they're welcome to do so. However, most people will probably be rational and join the consensus.

Be careful of what you are being told, and always follow the money.

Can you show your math on that estimate? It seems pretty clear to me that it's not "1 MB versus 1 GB blocks" - there's enormous benefit to be had from something inbetween. The current state of affairs is *not* acceptable, and a hacky kludge like segwit as a soft fork is an inefficient and unwieldly solution. If we just did a proper HF to allow larger blocks that can grow in the future  along with a greatly simplified HF version of segwit that offer way better security, the whole thing would be much, much more reasonable.

Maybe for now...
We need bigger blocks.
