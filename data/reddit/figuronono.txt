What is the “mathematics and code” in this case?

But the point is that you can consume more media and service products. In addition, most countries don’t consume efficiently. The absolute apple production capacity is often not the current apple production capacity. The number of apples consumed is often not the number grow.  Unused or inefficiently used land can be invested in. New methods of using formerly lost products can also be invested in. 
If i am only utilizing 50% of my production capacity but lack the money to invest in producing from the other 50% or better utilizing the current 50%, then taking a loan from another country (that country’s investment) i can increase output that ideally overcome interest at a faster rate than saving over time (if even possible) and investing savings would allow for. 
If i take out a loan to purchase a stock that increases in value faster than the loans interest and sell when the stocks value is greater than the loan, im making capital.

“Outsourcing savings” is literally deficit spending.

Your argument assumes as base level of material products. An economy may only be able to produce 100 apples, but it can also “produce” hotel rooms, vacation experiences, television and other media, and any number of other service industry products. Money spent on base raw goods is then reinvested into subsidiary industries. 
An apple is purchased. It could be eaten as is or turned into apple sauce. It could also keep its original state and be sold as part of a hotels breakfast. It might be purchased in bulk by a whole seller who sells it to vendors for conversions who sell it to specialized whole sellers who sell it to other vendors until it reaches the final customer. Each layer adds jobs and value past the original product.
