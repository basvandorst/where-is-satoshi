Quick update.
21 days and still counting.
I received a quick reply from their support after kraken-jpj got involved in this post. I followed their instructions (new account, clear history, restart pc) but the issue is still present.
Contacted them again through support and right now I just saw an answer saying same story "We sincerely apologise about the frustration caused by this issue. Please know that we are working hard on solving it. Please check regularly on your Kraken profile, and please try to create a new account with a different email address".
I don't know if someone of you found a solution so I am asking you to write here and provide an update.
Thank you all

I opened another 3 accounts using 3 different emails on firefox, opera and chrome.
Yesterday I tried with a fourth account. I thought that maybe since they made an upgrade it will work.
Same issue.

They recommended that in a reply when I wrote to their support "While developers are working on fixing this issue, you may wish to create a new account, which should resolve the issue. If it does not, please contact us back to let us know."
. 
Replied to that message and told them that even after second time the issue is present and I received this reply marked as ticked solved "check your Kraken profile frequently in anticipation of this solution. "
Replied again and no answer :)
I wrote on their reddit and the post was removed.

Thanks foodie500.
I opened another 2 accounts with different browser clients and emails and same issue.
It doesn't seems to work for me.

This is my first reddit post so please excuse me if there's something wrong.
I have same problem. I registered 2 days ago. I opened a ticket and received an automated reply saying to open a new account.
I followed the advice and opened 2 accounts but that didn't work.
I escalated the ticket followinf their reddit link and I just received an answer saying that I "should rest assured that the team is working very diligently on this issue" and I was advised to check my profile "frequently in anticipation of this solution.".
I have a friend waiting for 5 weeks for a solution and they stopped to answer him.
Any advice? Thanks

Thanks again foodie500. Coinbase is not working for me. I am from Romania and they don't offer support here.
