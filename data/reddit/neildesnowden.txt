They have fiat withdrawal problems due to government regulation, they have BTC withdrawal problems due to the malleability issue.

To be fair (and yes I had BTC in gox so maybe I'm biased) there are no completely reputable exchanges right now.  Absolutely any one of them could just run with your BTC at any time.

Nice one....
Yes, maybe some scientific consensus will be proven wrong sometime in the future.  But *right now* the knowledge and evidence using the scientific method shows us that climate change is happening due to greenhouse gas emissions by humans.
So we can either act on the most certain information we have, or hope that sometime in some future we will have a different conclusion.
Which would you prefer?
Right now, we are almost 100% certain that our carbon/methane etc. emissions are causing climate change.  Do you want to wait and hope that we conclude otherwise based on some possible (but unlikely) future data?

You're right, just less than 10% of mobile phones are recycled or collected from the tip for recycling.
But it doesn't mean you just give up.
We literally won't even be able to have half our electronics soon if we run out of even one of the precious metals that are used in them.  Coltan is the most known one.  Gorilla species are going extinct to mine it.  When we could just be recovering it from all the electronics we've already built but no longer want.
It's just so absurd to keep mining resources for phones and other electronics when we don't have to.

I've been like that, and still am from time to time.
You should try and focus on one single task.  One philanthropic endeavour.  Just pick something that is most dear to you, or that you wanted to change since you were younger, something like that.  Or even the thing that will make the most positive change, which is Bill Gates' method.
Focus on one thing, because you cannot change everything.  And it makes you more likely to actually do something because you aren't overwhelmed.
And I'm not just talking about you specifically.  Because if people thought like this, we would have half the problems we do today in this world.  Every good person would be taking on their own most important endeavour, and that way most problems would eventually be fixed.

That is one of the wallets in OP's post.
Me and another guy found it as well in another thread.  It's certainly interesting that a lot of people end up at that one in particular.  Although not sure what to make of it.  blockhain.info needs a "filter by size" option.  Would be much easier to see the larger orders which are more likely to lead to other gox addresses.
EDIT:  I found this one with BTC still in it   Lots of strange notes in there as well.

@_date: 2014-02-15 09:18:53
haha yeah I was gonna say the EFF is pretty much that.
These things come naturally.  Maybe it is better if we have no centralisation at all.  I mean, that's the nature of bitcoin (as soon as miners and exchanges are decentralised, the whole system will be).
Media can speak to the developers, as they already are (for the most part), and maybe it will work, maybe it won't.
But that's what we have to do IMO.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:25:21
You have the same info everyone else does.  But people have different conclusions.
If he was going to fuck off with everyone's money, he would have been gone by now.  Why would he keep updating the site?

Thanks for doing the math.  But I think maybe it's way off.  ASICs are far more than 2x as efficient than GPUs.  I don't know if it's feasible to calculate how many people are using ASICs though, and which type etc.
If you go with the Avalon ASIC batch three, it used 600W.  That's on average 2 video cards, but a lot of people were using 400+ watt cards, the 6850 or whatever.
They got ~0.5gh/s each, so 1gh/s for the two.  Avalon gets 63 Gh/s for the same wattage.
The new th/s miners are even more efficient, but just quickly looked up and used the first one with wattage stats that I could find.

Um, if there was a flaw, they would be justified in blaming the developers.  That said, if it were a known flaw that you were supposed to work around, yeah, no real excuses I guess.
@_date: 2014-03-02 08:19:34
But all that would do is send the coins to Gox's hot address.  Interesting theory though.  And quite a good idea for utilising cold storage coins.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:45:03
There is no way that happened.  They DID NOT HAVE AN AUTOMATED RESEND/REFUND SYSTEM.  End of story.  If it didn't withdraw properly, you had to contact support.
They did not just auto re-send.
Besides it would be more complicated to implement that than it would be to just manually handle errors, since errors should be extremely, extremely rare (almost non-existent).

I'd have to give up my normal job, which, while boring and mundane, gives me social contact.

No wonder professional traders are stressed as fuck.
I'll stick to the occasional trading when it's obvious I'll make some good gains quickly.
Also it doesn't say whether you can do this remotely?  Sounds like you can't though, which is just stupid.  If you can, I'd love to see someone with a bot apply for the job :P

Gox's exchange function was secondary to it's main purpose - to fund Karpeles' frappucino habit.
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:35:49
So why is gox insolvent?  There is zero evidence of that.  They collect millions in fees every day yet they are somehow insolvent?
Every major exchange is having the same problems but for some reason you think gox is insolvent for some reason?

Well Karpeles apparently proved solvency in April I think, by moving the cold storage coins around.  I'm sure if those coins were moved out, someone would have said so by now.  
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:42:52
It says this in the announcement.  It was probably a few different things.


Basically, *they* don't even really know.  They just suddenly realised the deposits and withdrawals weren't adding up.
Probably the malleability was a small amount, and hackers took the rest.

I disagree.  He is thoughtful and introspective, but he is not a nerd, or even particularly intelligent.
This is why he falls in to logical fallacy traps such as the "moon landing hoax" conspiracy.
He is, however, smart enough to eventually realise he is wrong, when presented with enough evidence.  Which is must better than can be said for the general population.

Honestly it would probably work.  Go in with a list of accounts that need their BTC withdrawn (to their withdrawal address on their accounts) immediately for personal reasons.  Be polite, and just say this list of people from reddit need to cash out asap and ask if they would they be able to do it now.

One key should have the ability to withdraw, the other should not (and can only do escrow etc.).  This would need to be a change to the bitcoin protocol probably, but it would make security SO MUCH easier when using online bitcoin services.

Yeah great movie, although probably not at all true, besides the purely business part of it.

If there are no miners, bitcoin doesn't exist.  People need to mine for the interest in it.  No one is mining solely for the money anymore.

haha, yeah it was a credit union (I'm in Australia so chances are you probably don't use the same bank).  Sad too, coz there aren't any others around here.  Current bank is fairly shitty too security-wise, but still better than the credit union.

Yep.  I could easily see myself answering the wrong one just because I wasn't paying enough attention.
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:41:59
That is *not* a good solution, which is why people are saying to download the full blockchain and make set yourself up as a node.  Imagine if everyone is just using the lite clients and only a few servers contain the full blockchain.  It's the opposite of what bitcoin is about.
The person who owns the server could just modify the blockchain for their own nefarious purposes and no one would know (at least for a long time).

No, it's not about faith.
Pretty much every scientist who has studied evolution concludes it is true.  Using the scientific method, which was specifically created to eliminate the need for faith or belief or just guessing, they have concluded evolution occurs.
Furthermore, everything evolves.  I plant some tomatoes, one plant dies and it doesn't pass on its genes.  The stronger ones survive and pass on their genes.  I've just witnessed evolution.
Trillions and trillions of planets.  We'll stick to the 8 in our solar system.  The first two are too hot for life, so life didn't survive or possible never occurred there.  Same for the one past Earth, except they are too cold.  Earth is in just the right temperature zone, so life survived.
That's evolution too.
It's not faith.  It's a fact.  If something is too weak to survive, it will die.  If something is not right for a certain eventuality, that thing will not happen.
It's just how it is.  How can you argue against that?  To say it's faith means that you have to accept the possibility that something being too weak to survive in a certain environment will somehow still survive and pass on its genes.

@_date: 2014-03-02 08:43:01
Nah, it's likely to be at least *close* to one of the theories, since there are so many of them.
I think another theory could be that the legal issues could have forced Mark to try and hide all the BTC, so he can claim bankruptcy and then not have to pay all those huge fines from the stupid lawsuits.
As for outside theft, I mean, if someone was competent enough to somehow gain access to their wallets they would have realised they'd be FAR better off making the withdrawals look like normal withdrawals, over time.
They may not have gotten all of it before someone noticed, but they could have gotten tens of millions of dollars very easily, and actually be able to spend that.

Thing is, there were never any problems withdrawing BTC from Gox until around 2 weeks ago.  I bet most people there were not planning on withdrawing fiat, and those problems were reasonably due to legal requirements.  So they didn't see much risk in leaving it there to trade since BTC withdrawals worked perfectly alright.

There are too many people pushing for these things.  All you need to do is say "do you accept bitcoin?"  at online or offline stores where you think it would be more convenient to use bitcoin and *you would actually spend bitcoin there*.
If enough separate people ask, the store owner/s will look in to it themselves.  And then there will also be enough people buying with bitcoin, the owners won't have false expectations.
@_date: 2014-02-15 12:04:51
Right, maybe the don't.  But they obviously have reserves in cold storage.  So they don't want to spread fear.  No company would want to.
They are working to fix the issue.
If they wanted to run off with everyone's remaining coins, they would have done so already and Karpeles would not be posting on Github or coming in to his office.

They didn't have that though.  They never had an automated system in place.  Ever.  I don't know why people keep saying this.  Maybe coz the SR 2.0 owners said that's how they lost their BTC?  I don't know.
Gox never did that though.  Thieves would have had to have continually scammed Gox support, thousands of times....
It's unlikely to say the least.

Apparently those charged are still pending in a separate case.  But yeah, this life sentence doesn't involve murders in any way.  And frankly, those charges are absolute crap anyway.  No one was murdered, corrupt cops had access to servers and could have made the whole thing up.... just the corrupt cops being crucial to the investigation should be enough to throw the whole thing out of court.

I thought people would have been too.
This is all I can find.  And I'm too drunk to figure out what happened

The problem is it needs middlemen for brick and mortar purchases because of confirmation times.  So it really offers no benefit over CC or cash. Sure fees are lower now, but the companies facilitating payments could easily become just as bad as banks.  It's hard to see it being used for in person transactions.  Luckily more stuff is being bought online now and that will only increase in the future.

Good points.  And I suppose with larger transaction ($10,000's +, cars, houses etc.) wait times would be okay just to be certain.

Well yeah.  They have to extract all these nutrients from food, so you've got the actual food cost, plus the extraction and preservation costs and packaging/shipping etc.  Probably a lot more I'm not taking in to account.

Drugs are safer when legalised and regulated.  You know what's way more of a problem than lowering inhibition and causing OD?  Impure drugs, with occasional periods of high purity drugs or drugs sold as different drugs.  That's when streams of OD's happen.
At least if it's pure and made in a proper lab, you know what you're getting and the dosage.
And why should something be illegal just because someone might harm themselves with it?  Last I checked death cap mushrooms are totally legal.  No one's ever died from psilocybin mushrooms, but they're illegal.
It's got nothing to do with safety.
@_date: 2014-02-11 09:46:04
I should have done this.  They've only been good to me.  But I got spooked by some rumours about the owner.
Nonetheless, they've been nothing but good to me, and they are the only reason I have BTC to begin with.
I will be recouping my BTC using them for sure, when I can afford to.  Assuming Gox really is finished, which I hope it isn't.

Intelligent people are not Libertarians.  (just gonna wait for the downvote train on this one).  But seriously, it doesn't take much thought to realise Libertarianism doesn't work.
It's a nice concept, but if you look deeper than the initial alluring concept, it's retarded (as long as we have money and scarce resources, anyway.  If we have neither of those, it would work wonderfully).

The problem is most people do not recycle, because there is no monetary incentive.  Apple does have a recycling program and will pay you for the computer or phone etc., but most people don't know about that.
I wonder how many of the people that posted videos of them smashing their phone went to take it to a phone recycling bin/facility.  Statistics say maybe 1 of them.

Media always want to talk to some "authority" which is why every cause/special interest has a group of people under a name, so the media can contact them for a statement when a story comes up.

On Gox.  It is a lot when they sell below the market price (was at ~230 and they set sell for ~220).  If there isn't sufficient buy orders, i.e if they time it right, it sends the price plummeting very quickly.   There was only 800 BTC of buy orders sitting between ~230 and ~220.  Once that one sell was done, panic took hold.

@_date: 2013-10-25 02:32:23
haha.  Well, don't count it out just yet.  That was pretty much due to one person selling 800BTC below market price, which made the first plummet and created panic.  BTC is unpredictable though, that's for sure.
Sad thing was I was thinking there might be a dip and was thinking of selling, then a few minutes later....
Yep I agree, 200 seems fairly stable, I think it's definitely the lower end for now, might dip below for a while after the (still going) bubble.
But you're right, short term spec is mostly gambling.  I'm in for the long haul, just try to make a little more here and there, but always gonna buy more when it's low :)

Why do people keep saying Ponzi scheme?  Do they even know what that is?  It's not even close.

@_date: 2013-09-22 01:52:35
You disagree with that?  That's how it always is.  Just look at RC's for the most recent example of it.  They always use a new method of getting drugs or new drugs as an excuse to crack down even harder.
I think now it *may* have come to a point where their efforts are even more fruitless than before.  They won't stop just because of that, though.  It will only stop when drugs are legal.

I didn't really have an epiphany, but I was like "damn.... this could literally change the whole financial system.... and psychopaths won't be leading the change, it'll be people who are actually relatively intelligent and knowledgeable".
Something like that.  And the benefits keep impressing me more and more.  Which is kind of how these things go for me.  I keep thinking of more benefits every time I think about it or discuss it.  Such as bringing the 3rd world out of poverty, assuming they're early adopters.

Haha, I did the exact same thing.  I also accidentally send some BTC (around .8, but still) to that wallet, coz I mistook the MtRed wallet address for a wallet on MtRed, when it was the withdraw address, which was the old one on a computer which I'd formatted several times and given to my mum.

This is extremely infuriating.  That judge has NO FUCKING IDEA what's going on in that case!  Not a single idea.  It's like she/he thinks the guy stole sensitive information from the government and "open sourcing" something means you are opposing Murica and opening them up to terrorist attacks.
It's just fucking absurd.  First order of business should be that judges need to have some sort of specialised course which teaches them a little bit about everything.
Anyway, as for the bitcoin side - I don't think any of us have called ourselves hackers, it's only the media that has done that in the past when talking about mining, and sometimes still does, but it's largely been corrected.  And unless Satoshi worked for the government and used some ideas from there, we're probably okay.

That's very unusual....  Something is wrong there.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:49:54
Yeah.  I guess so.  So what we really need is a pool which has no central owner and distributes payouts evenly to every miner.  Could that be done within the bitcoin protocol?  Or some p2p network which ensures people are not mining together?
Whenever a block is found, everyone mining (individually), gets some of the reward.
I think this could be possible, but it may require every miner needing to be identified via a unique, static IP address.
I dunno, I feel like this is one of the biggest problems with bitcoin, and I don't have enough knowledge and am probably not smart enough to come up with a solution to it.  I just know we need one.

I would say current banking is easier to use, Bitcoin is far more complicated to use.  It would be easier to understand how the Bitcoin network works, than how the banking system works.
The financial system in general is just like.... wtf, I'll never understand this, but it's obviously set up to benefit the people who do and who already have lots of money.  Bitcoin is simple as hell in that regard, there's no bullshit rules and you don't *have* to confine yourself to any rules that individual Bitcoin companies have.
Anyway, more on topic, we do need simpler clients, we don't want the first group of mainstream adopters to send money to the wrong address or delete their life savings or something.

Their size is a negative, a *major* one.  It doesn't matter if it's their only negative.  Even if you cannot find evidence of them being dodgy, it doesn't matter.  That's basically the antithesis of bitcoin.
Do we want to have a pool with close to or over 51% of the hashing power and just trust one group of people that they aren't going to use that power for nefarious purposes?

@_date: 2013-11-25 01:21:07
Yeah, one of the main attractions "back in the day" (a couple of years ago) was that bitcoin was anonymous.  Not really sure where that myth came from, but it was a large reason why people some people got interested in it.
If there is a true anonymous coin, I'd say it would be useful for the black markets.  Or just anyone who wants to be anonymous, but probably it would only be accepted in black markets.
I've heard a little about ZeroCoin, but I really don't know much about it yet.
Also just FYI, the change to scrypt was not for no good reason.  It's actually to keep the mining in the hands of a larger number of people.  Of course if it takes off, ASIC's will be made for that too.  But that was the original intent.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:08:57
Another guy just posted that there are only 2 million or so addresses with BTC in them.  I'd say maybe around 1/3rd of bitcoiners are American (if that, it's probably lower really.  So probably more like 99.9% of Americans don't have bitcoins.

Mobile phones and computers should be recycled.  You don't need to scrap them entirely.  Pretty much all the materials are the same in computers now as they were when the first desktop came out.
You can recycle your computer by sending it back to the company you bought it from.  I know Apple has this info available on their website for phones and computers.  Samsung as well I think.
But with any phone, you can send it to recycling places, regardless of brand.  They will take all the materials and send it to be made in to new phones.
Whereas the companies will usually go for "reuse" first, they'll erase the data and resell it.
Now obviously this doesn't change the problem with poorer people not having access, as I doubt they're reselling to third world countries.  For that, I suggest building new laptops and phones which are light and simple, with a long battery life.  It just makes more sense.
I bet someone could make a new bitcoin business/charity from this.  If I had the funds or know how, I'd definitely do it.
Acquire phones and computers - people donate a few mBTC when they send it to you for recycling.
You use this money to:
Salvage usable materials
Build light, simple laptops and phones
Send to poorer regions.
Would be a great charity for the environment and helping to bring countries out of poverty.

That lightbulb thing couldn't be more relevant today.  LED lights can last 200 years easily.  They took so long to actually reach mass production for household use because they needed to make them last only about 2 years.  Scumbags.

I'm thinking 450, but will briefly go to 500 as well.  I think 300 with a quick rise to 500 and dip is a bit too large of a gap.  I do agree the new price will be around 200 though.

You do realise needle exchange mean you exchange dirty needles to get clean ones, right?
This means no needles lying around in parks for kids to step on, which is a massive (albeit largely overstated) fear among the general population, even if they don't care about addicts.
I think the addicts are important as well, but the point is it is not just about them.  It also helps to control diseases which are easily spread to other people, like hepatitis.

You do realise tax-payer funded healthcare works in every country it's been used, right?  Have you thought maybe it's just your government that sucks?  Not the tax system?
Seriously. think about it.


Like.... exactly what the FDA/TGA/FSA does?  Why would you want a private company to do it instead (at massively increased cost)?  Why is that better?  What's stopping them from lying for payouts?  Who's going to make sure they aren't corrupt?


Uhuh....  Who's going to build the freeways and highways?  Cities and country towns are further away from suburbs where most people live.  Farmers will not be able to pay for that, so there goes food supply.  Extremely important infrastructure, which no one will pay for.  I'm talking in the trillions of dollars just for one state.  I don't think you realise how expensive that is.

Deflation just discourages pointless spending.  Which is good.
This right here is not deflation, it's just ridiculous value increase.  When price stabilises after widespread adoption, we won't have these gigantic price increases.  People will spend BTC because you need to spend money to live and most people want some luxuries.

Okay, and what happens when people decide they don't feel like paying any taxes for healthcare, then they get sick and can't pay for their own healthcare?
Do we let them die?
I actually think that's a good option, people would realise they have to and want to pay for it, but the rich wouldn't be paying anything, so the poor would have to pay much more to keep the system running.
And then there's the issue of programs of which the benefits are not immediately obvious to most people, science for example.
Maybe you would allocate your taxes to be spent there, but do you think 95% of people even think about science? Nope.
They don't realise the benefits of it, scientific funding would drop to almost nothing.
There's a reason we have representative democracy - most people are idiots and have no capacity for forward thinking.

I'm not sure about your other points, the tumbler service should be automatic and no one should know where the coins are going.
But yeah, the actual amounts being sent is enough to negate the whole thing.  UNLESS, you employ some disguising, and I don't know if any mixers do this.
(edit: just read the rest of your post, I see you've mentioned some ways to do it)
You could also send the output to a few different addresses.  I'd say that would take care of it.  As long as there is a little bit of a gap between the sending to each address and enough coins from different sources going through the tumbler.

Consider an algorithm that will cost $100,000 dollars for an ASIC that can mine it.  Maybe only 1 or 2 people would buy it.  As you go down to $10,000 cost, as we have seen, many people buy them.  Take that down to $1000, probably we'd see numbers on par with GPU miners.  $100, every man and his dog would have one.
With more people, it is less likely for them to all go to one pool.

It would be much better.  I was thinking about this last night.
Especially on exchanges.  You see so many 0.0041 etc. orders now, and it looks like irrelevant orders.  But then you realise it's actually significant, because the value has risen so much compared to a few weeks ago.  I mean last time you saw 1000 BTC orders/sells constantly.  Now you're lucky to get a few hundred at a time.
Anyway, yeah it makes perfect sense to use satoshis, because even now, a lot of orders look much, much smaller than they really are.

It could also be the big players preventing it from crashing *while* they're cashing out their large amounts, so they get more for it.  Then they'll probably use a smaller part of their hoardings and disable the bots to crash it properly.
Could be either one though.  But I'd be surprised if they're losing BTC for some sort of altruistic purpose.

See how that *isn't* an argument, I'm sure it's clearer when you don't agree with it.
You just stated something as fact, gave no reasons for it, and assume you've answered the question, which you didn't.
Why is a competitive market more economically efficient?
Take the national broadband network (before it was fucked over the current conservative government) in Australia.  It would cost 44 billion to build, country wide, regional towns, everything.
MAYBE private companies could have done it more cheaply, but they were never going to, ever.  Telstra would happily sit with their copper network for the rest of civilisation, rorting consumers who have no other choice of ISP (all cables went through Telstra, so even buying from a different company, you still go through Telstra).
The NBN would deliver 100x faster internet speed, more cheaply than what we pay now.  The fees were simply to cover the costs of building it, over time, and to provide a small revenue for maintaining etc. after that.  No/very little profits.
You can't get more efficient than that.  
Whereas Telstra would do the same thing they've always done, if they ever did build it, which they wouldn't have.

Yep, they really should not be able to take that money, All those people had done NOTHING.  They had BTC sitting on a website, what justifies the feds seizing it?  I wonder if they'll ever get it back.
If it was sitting in escrow, I guess I can see some sort of justification according to the laws, but not if it was in their wallet on the site.
@_date: 2013-12-23 11:56:50
Judging by previous huge tips.  More like get your mundane and/or anti-bitcoin comments ready.
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:54:29
Not exactly.... The miners don't trade fiat for BTC.  So there is some fiat leakage.  Currently a few billion.

It's overpriced by infinity.  Ubuntu is free.  I think it's pretty dodgy to sell it.
Never mind, Just saw his reply.  Seems like a good guy and makes sense if people can't be bothered with making the CD themselves.

Don't really wanna go to your link as I've never seen that site before.  But I can't see this pattern in the graphs, nor OP's pattern.

I'll sell you it now if that's what you want.
@_date: 2013-10-21 09:33:31
I am with you man.  This subreddit is chock full of libertarian nutjobs at the moment.  It's fucking ridiculous.  I never thought anyone would seriously argue against taxation in general until the last couple of months here.
Certain areas of taxation, level of taxation, type of taxation, sure.  Arguing against taxation as a concept?  I don't understand it at all.
Where do you people think you would be without taxation?  You'd have NO healthcare, and your healthcare already suck massive dick compared to other developed nations with higher taxes than you.
You'd have no roads, or you'd have to pay tolls for every road you ever drive on.
NASA would have never landed a man on the moon....
Should I go on?
The problem isn't taxation, it's not enough tax on the rich and too much on the poor, as well as your complete lack of care for lobbying the government to use your taxes for your country's benefit, rather than on war.
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:52:50
And the guy that just admitted they were HIS bitcoins.  So much for plausible deniability.
Oh, also, does anyone think this may be indicative of him not having another stash?  Seems weird that if he had the bigger private stash people were talking about, that he wouldn't give a shit about these 175,000.

What he's saying is that they are too slow to keep up.  Which means we will pass the point where there can take a proper stance on anything, with faster and faster technological change.  It's not about what stance they take, it's that we will leave them behind.  They'll just be a bunch of people struggling for control but unable to keep up.
Kinda analogous with the new drugs coming out all the time.  Most governments only just banned the fake weed shit, like 5 years after it came out. lol  There are hundreds of new drugs in that time, including new "fake weed" chemicals.

It's not a different point.  What I'm saying is people would rather use fiat and bank etc. atm rather than learning to secure their own bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-10 08:47:56
Some people are in it to make fiat.  Others (many more), are in it for the concept, but it is unfortunately not possible right now to use BTC solely.  Or at least it is very difficult, and fiat is better for every day living at the moment.
When bitcoin is more widespread, I will, without a doubt, be using it on a daily basis.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:55:52
I am almost certain half the people here don't even know how bitcoin works and just want fiat profit.  Someone has to mine!

SR pretty much made Bitcoin.  You can't just ignore that.  Also if I were to sum Bitcoin up, in its essence, it would be through SR.  It's a great representation of how powerful Bitcoin is.

Um.... but he had no moral qualms about drugs.  If they said he used to facilitate trade of guns but decided to stop that because it was morally wrong, then it doesn't make him look evil, and they want him to look evil.
But yes it is interesting that they didn't make a big deal about the drug trafficking facilitation, I mean, you see busts of a couple of hundred Cannabis plants and videos of the cops burning them on the news.  Who knows....
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:17:45
Ok that's interesting.  Will have to read up a bit.

@_date: 2013-12-01 01:14:47
haha, I remember the times too.  I have spent years watching this, waited too long and had too many roadblocks to invest.  $15 mining seemed futile, 30-70 I wanted to buy but had no money.  Dip back to 50 I couldn't find anywhere to buy.  Finally bought at $190 a couple of weeks ago.
I'm happy with my small gains at this point, nothing else I could have done, so I'm not gonna let that thought grip my mind too often.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:41:58
Good point.  I guess a lot of people trust people or companies etc. more than science or code or facts etc.

I think he's just saying you should make drugs legal, rather than skirt around the law, and that would be a more ideal situation.  He's right, of course, but making them legal will take at least another few years.

Yeah this subreddit kinda sucks now, don't worry, you're not alone in that thinking.
Just think buy BTC at btc-e which is $180 currently, and transfer that to Mt. Gox which is $203 currently, then sell on Gox for fiat.  You just made money through arbitrage.
Just in case you are thinking of doing this, though.... It is not worth it unless you have an easy way to buy BTC again on btc-e (or any other exchange with a lower price than Gox or btcchina).  Unless you want to just do one huge trade to make an, on average, $15-$20 profit per $100 you put in.
@_date: 2013-11-11 12:02:56
The stablisation thing is kinda of a catch-22 as aveman101 said, but I think it definitely will stabilise first.  That doesn't mean it won't keep rising as more and more adopt it, but it won't have these gigantic 100-dollars-in-a-day swings.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:33:21
Look at the bitcointip bot documentation 
You can get a small amount based on how much karma you have.
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:07:47
And pretty shortly after you got it all set up there were cheaper and better computers/modems etc. etc.
Didn't deter people.
Anyway, btc price will stabalise long before it's widely accepted, so it's a moot point OP.
Oh and you definitely do not need all that verification bullshit.  I'm in Australia where it was almost impossible to get bitcoins until this year.  I can go down to the bank, make a deposit and have my coins within the day.  Whereas paypal takes at LEAST 3 days to get any money in there.  And when initially setting up, it takes at least a week all up.

**Even if you don't agree with someone you shouldn't downvote perfectly legitimate arguments.**
I'm with you brother, btw, but this subreddit is chock full of libertarians.  Just in case you didn't know.  It's useless trying to tell them that taxes are necessary, and it's just the U.S government which is fucked.

Yeah, when the new cards come out I'll probably go back to LTC, right now I'm losing money coz of electricity costs.  I've been wondering what the PS4 GPU will be like, it's got 8GB of GDDR5 memory.  I bet that'd be worth it, if you can remove it from the console.
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:57:40
I don't think that changed anything.  SHA256 ASIC's are probably more expensive than some other algorithm's potential ASIC's.  If the rewards are enough, people will still buy them.
Do we want to use an algorithm that has an ASIC cost of a million dollars, so no one would buy them?
I'm not sure if that could be done, as I know next to nothing about it.
I agree ASIC's are a problem.... we need as many miners as possible.  But wouldn't it be better to just wait until the cost of SHA256 ASIC's are low enough that more people buy them?  Rather than making the cost higher?
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:00:33

hehe, just poking fun at the people who still ask that.  It's not even worth mining LTC with GPU anymore, especially with the continual downward trend in value.  BTC is almost as fast now anyway, with the increase in network hashing power, I've lost all faith in LTC, it has no advantages anymore.

@_date: 2013-11-23 03:31:48
I've also been wondering whether the fees will be enough in the future to cover mining costs.  I mean.... it needs to cross a certain threshold to make mining worthwhile, otherwise no one will do it.
I don't know what that threshold is, but I'm concerned it may make bitcoin unattractive because the fees to transact will be higher than banking fees now.
I really have no idea whether they will have to be too high, but that's why it's a concern of mine.
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:37:40
Yeah I really don't understand that.  The banks are getting the money either way when companies accept BTC as payment.  They should be happy that some money is being returned to the fiat market....

Good point.  One way to think about it is probably anyone here would know the position of every key on their keyboard.  Although I wouldn't trust myself to remember every single character in my private key if I had a lot of BTC in there.  Too risky if you just forget one char.

Also, think about what you could do, if you become a millionaire, or a billionaire.  You wouldn't need to chase grants anymore, you could do your own research or fund other researchers.  With decreasing government funding for science in a lot of countries, this will be extremely beneficial for you, and you can go back to fully doing what you love and helping society advance.
Good luck :)

Possible.  I was thinking the other day that bitcoin might make the youngest billionaire.  The current youngest is 29, one of the founders of facebook.
I bet there's a few early miners right now under 20 years old currently who are millionaires.  If it hits 10,000 soon, we'll likely have some very young billionaires.

That's true.  I think any transfers of over 10,000 dollars usually is the average for needing to be reported, anything under and they dgaf.  I guess maybe do smaller transactions instead of everything at once, even though it may cost a little more and take longer.

That's pretty stupid to say.  Many poor countries have much more personal freedom than 1st world countries.  It actually seems the opposite to me, the more wealth, the more wealthy people try to control everyone else, to increase their wealth further, or maybe just a power play, either way, that seems to be what happens.

That's what your downvote is for, if you feel it necessary.  I'm getting pretty annoyed at the amount of posts saying "can we stop with (thing) posts?".
I personally enjoy these Anonymous initiatives, gets me feeling positive.
Also they won't be able to microtrade in bitcoin, unless they set up their own exchanges I guess.  That nets them millions a day, just trading based on latency.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:44:53
That's dumb.  You have to assume it will keep going up, which it won't.  And also when it's expensive, it takes a lot more of a move to gain any worthwhile profit.
If I bought at $50, the move to $100 is already doubling my money.  If I buy at $800, it has to get to $1600 before I've doubled my money, which will take quite a long time, if it even happens.
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:57:11

Doesn't change anything.  Miners can still congregate to one pool.

Think outside your little economic box.  Has higher GDP made Americans (or any first world people) happier?  Has it really improved our lives that much?  Is it worth it?
Mass consumption does NOT drive efficiency, if anything it holds it back because they release incremental improvements on things to maximise profit.  Coz they know people will buy the new one every year.

Except when it does happen, there is recourse for the victims/families of the victims.  How do you get that without a government?
There's also FAR less deaths *because* of government regulations.  Look at the supplement industry if you want to see an unregulated market at work.  Most of the supplements are made of dried grass and a tonne of them are sold as something other than what they're marketed as.
Meanwhile, I can get any drug in a pharmacy at the exact dosage needed without any chance of getting the wrong drug, and get it cheaply (I'm not American, so I don't pay $400 a pill).

You could also have some automated checking thing as you leave the store, I imagine that'd be trivial to add, rather than someone going through every item and cross-checking.
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:02:07
It's far easier to manipulate.  Look at all the 0.1 orders, just like BTC had during April run up.  It's got no future.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:19:28


Is there any way to find the first transaction on blockchain.info?
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:16:55
Am I the only one who has a problem with this?


That's fucking insane!  You need more ID to do anything with fiat - BTC than you do with just fiat, or even between different country's currencies.
BTC is supposed to help you be anonymous when you want to be, instead we're getting the opposite, with this, and with exchanges needing photo ID and utility bill etc.
Why do they need palm prints?  You don't need that for anything else in Canada, or anywhere.  I highly doubt it's necessary to comply with the law.
Just let me put in cash and get BTC, ffs.
@_date: 2013-11-06 11:57:26
Ah, good for you, yep you should point that out, but you have now :)
@_date: 2013-10-15 11:59:07
Ah.... good point there, hadn't thought of that.
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:57:40
$20000 via paypal
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:48:24
I read that 3 times as "double spend".  So confused trying to figure out how you figured that out.
@_date: 2013-12-23 11:21:09
And you get like a 10,000 dollar fine for chewing gum.  Awesome freedom going on there.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:29:44
I sold at 450.... ugh
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:25:49
I don't think so.  It may still have worked, but it would have taken a LOT longer to get off the ground.
@_date: 2013-12-24 10:09:01
He supposedly had an 80 million stash.  Not much use for 30 extra really.  Both those prices were before the price rise though.  So both are worth more now.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:27:51
Just double or triple check the address you're sending to.  If you copy and paste it, it should be alright.
I'm sure we'll also have an abstraction layer on top soon where you can make accounts tied to words, which could be your name or a phrase, anything.  I think this will reduce the amount of incorrect addresses being sent BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:58:15
If that's true, why would he bother trying to get these back?
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:24:46
Hm, see it's difficult to establish actual values for those terms.  I'm afraid it would be left open to interpretation unless we set some definable value like "$100b market cap", "used in 90% of countries", "most places don't convert straight back in to fiat", things like that.
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:54:42
pics or didn't happen
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:34:12
LOL we never actually reach the moon.  I find that hilarious.
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:21:38
I would not be surprised.  That takedown notice was very strange indeed.  Noticed it straight away when I saw it.  But.... why wouldn't they have just copied one from any of the other taken down websites, rather than making their own?
Maybe the FBI etc. are just getting cocky.
Although the other things he posits are interesting. I see no evidence of his "constantly edited nose" in that interview though.
And the "bugged records" etc. I wouldn't even know how to check, and he shows no evidence of this claim.
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:12:39
"you got me"
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:35:54
@_date: 2013-11-10 08:56:25
haha $300 or so here.  Yeah, not worth worrying about it though.
You can never always pick the valleys and peaks.  Just gotta go with what you think at the time, chances are it's gonna go higher or lower 99.999 percent of the time, so just focus on whether you made profit or not.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:18:53
Yep, I was actually happy when reading the comments and seeing the poll statistics.  It's too early for it to gain widespread adoption.  Plus I have more time to buy now. :)
@_date: 2013-10-15 11:36:58
Australia (before the recent election), Canada, and all of Scandinavia (they are really the best governments, but I thought that didn't need to be said so I put them last).
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:30:51
really? That's insane.  I love and hate coincidences like this.  Hate because it really makes me question my reality.
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:19:19
Can you alert the "justice" (whoever stopped the other pyramid scheme) to this scam?
@_date: 2013-11-11 12:09:43
I don't use an offline wallet at the moment, I've got it in an exchange.
Though if you've got any questions, feel free to ask.
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:36:31
Exactly.  He basically said "I don't know why they're trying to stop it".  Could be bad use of words, but not sure.
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:40:30
Same happened to me at around $15.  Australia was crazy late to the game in regards to transfers/actually getting the BTC with AUD.  Searched for hours and hours for a way to do it which didn't incur large costs and had a low risk of getting scammed.   Every option had problems, so I gave up in frustration.
Eh....  I'm buying as much as I can now to make up for it.  Every spare dollar is going in.
@_date: 2013-10-14 12:59:18
Huh?  How do you ban a business using bitcoin, exactly?  Good luck with that, if any government is thinking of doing it.
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:40:05
False.  Maybe America will collapse, the rest of the world will go on alright without you.  Probably better off.
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:04:31
Nope, you'll get it, verify just makes bitcointip bot publicly verify it.
It may be too small of an amount to withdraw, don't know how much it was coz he didn't verify.
You also have to PM bitcointip with "ACCEPT" before you actually get them.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:27:44
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:44:23
Bitcoin also has zero intrinsic value, if it's not a currency.  It's only value is as a currency, which allows it to have value to used as a commodity.
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:14:19
That line made me realise that some of the biggest companies are literally at war (albeit a cyber war) with the governments of the developed world.  Pretty insane to think about.
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:43:05
haha, dat graph.
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:00:31
It's frustrating reading the account names with "at" in front of them.
@_date: 2013-12-23 11:33:50
The U.S does that, just in different countries and covertly.  With their own citizens, they just lock them up in jail.  And don't pretend that's not comparable to Hilter-era Germany, most of the people in jail are black.
@_date: 2013-10-15 11:54:13
Actually I really did have the foresight, I didn't have a single dime to my name.  Even when it was 1/3 through the huge bubble, I was wanting to invest coz I knew it'd go higher.  I really just didn't have any money then, no job.
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:16:26
Maybe because bitpay will be more resilient even if bitcoin falls to only be used by a niche group?  Not sure.
