If bitcoin fails, it's game over. No cryptocurrency will again be used as a store of value for the foreseeable future. As a transaction medium, maybe, but meaningful cryptocurrency investment will cease to exist.
So, I really hope you are wrong.

BTC will never reach a new ATH. Show's over folks. Get out while you still can.

Yeah the nomenclature they came up with is...unfortunate.

If someone did, they would be able to write an alternate implementation that achieves 100% consensus with bitcoind. To date, no one has. Every alternate implemenation invariably forks the blockchain due to some unforeseen edge case. Which is also why the devs are deathly afraid to touch the core consensus code, and why it will likely not be changed unless some existential threat to bitcoin arises.

Yeah, people don't seem to realize that if bitcoin is "killed" by an altcoin, the holders of that altcoin will lose as well, since no cryptocurrency after that point will ever again be used as a store of value. I made a comment to this effect a couple days ago.
I think the side chain idea (if it works) is a great way to get the development benefits of alts without endangering the value proposition of bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general.

Give the guy a break. If bitcoin fails, it's his head people will be roasting on a spit. He has got to be telling himself some real fairy tales in order to be able to sleep at night.

Holy shit, the COO's name was Mr. Papageorgio? Talk about your red flags!

It leaves you with only two decimal places to deal with, which is friendly to existing accounting software and more readable to humans.

Speculative money will never "flee" from bitcoin into an alt to any great extent. If bitcoin is heavily debased because of an altcoin, that money will go back into fiat because people will realize that if bitcoin can be usurped by an alt, then there is nothing preventing the same thing from happening to the next flavor of the week.
At that point, cryptocurrencies will cease to be used as a speculative instrument or store of value. The coin will hold enough value to support instantaneous transaction volume, and no more.
For the same reason, value will eventually flow out of the altcoins. As the gap between litecoin and the next most valuable coin narrows, this effect will accelerate.

A lot of people either don't seem to get it, or aren't saying as much. Even supposed bitcoin luminaries. Perhaps because they are trying to get rich off altcoins?
It seems to be a pretty common trope that Bitcoin might be the Myspace of cryptocurrencies, in the sense that something better could come along and become more successful. People "hedging" by buying litecoin and so forth. I think the altcoin explosion might have a lot to do with that sentiment becoming popular.

And the inverse is also true, because apparently wash sale rules don't apply. If you bought 10 btc at 1000, later sold them at 500 and immediately bought them back, you would be able to declare a loss of $5000.
It doesn't make a damn bit of sense.

If you're trying to find the code, it's in **core/src/main/java/com/google/bitcoin** . Fuck java, seriously.

No one fully understands the core protocol, aside from maybe the one guy who wrote the couple thousand lines of amateurish C++ that implements it, and he is dead or gone. At this point we are all kind of trusting that blob of code to do the right thing.
