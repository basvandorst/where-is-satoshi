Your liver is the only organ that can repair itself but the diet also depends on how bad the cancer is to. You need to get your body alkaline based and stay away from acidic foods(meat, dairy).

I will probably cut my losses if it gets to 10k. I will at least recover some of my free cash. ��

Try a raw vegan diet, no guarantee though.

I can’t even use btc cause the fees so it just sits in my wallet ��. I have to use ETH instead.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:53
This sucks but i am holding and losing ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:42:22
Doubt it
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:38:49
I own fractions to but i am almost at 1 ltc. I wish they would add iota, eos or something to coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:36:52
Today got me all screwed up and then this guy lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:01
People are selling like a mofo on gdax
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:07:46
I like exodus but I wish I had multi coin wallet on ios at least till ledger price drops down.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:26:55
Isn’t kraken european? I live in US
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:17:17
Oh well, i would rather not leave my btc on coinbase/gdax because of what happened
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:16:33
Binance is a pain with the 0.001 limit and high fees
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:18:53
Got to start small as a beginner
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:36:56
Fees are pretty high for me on exodus specifically btc 61$ to move 50$. It won’t let convert either...
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:10:59
I can buy coins instantly with a credit card. They seem safe, I have had no issues with them. I just move my money to gdax then to my wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:37:24
Isn’t ripple centralized and with banks?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:07:43
I sold all coins and bought back in at a low price except btc which has retarded fees so it just sits in my wallet collecting dust.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:35:34
Yea not much though, i guess i could buy but coinbase is untrustworthy atm
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:26:34
I moved everything I had, storing longterm. I hope it pays off ��.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:31:44
This price is going up and down 1k in matter of seconds
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:02:47
I guess shapeshifting BTC into LTC or ETH wouldn’t be worth it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:49
I wish i could buy more, maybe 100$ ��...
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:03
Yup i am holding. Can’t do much at work but watch the money vanish lol.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:03:15
And I liked how easy coinbase was to use ��.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:50:04
Definitely ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:31:08
No lube, I need help
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:16:26
Mass sellout going on now ��
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:02:43
I don’t think they tax you crypto to crypto until jan 1.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:53:24
Binance is annoying with fees and .001 limit on btc trades buy/sell and withdraws. Bittrex, I can’t even signup for it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:14:57
You have to have .001 with each purchase. If i want to buy 1 eos they won’t let you because it is under .001 btc
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:22:36
I started small because I don’t trust a foreign exchange. I have btc, ltc and eth saved up.
