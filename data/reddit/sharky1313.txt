Or it just is. Criticize all you want, I am not on this all day. Its just a theory.

Do you have the link? I have read other people reference this.

I like it. Particularly the Aaron Paul bit!

Because I am human and can't read it all. Just found and read the document, I have questions about legitimacy. 
We will just have to wait won't we?

Already got it. Thanks for the helpful insight. I see you read the edit as well.

Classic PR strategy. Say nothing. Better to beg forgiveness than ask for permission.

What a day!

That too.

More pragmatism. I accept this could be entirely wrong.

I see your argument but a lack of sources is never a burden of proof.

Thanks! I had that idea, thank you for the confirmation. Does it serve the faucets any advantages?

Canadian Virtual Exchange will do a cash deposit for a small fee. Trading costs are high but the money moves within the day. Once in, you can move it to another trader. I was asked today, at the bank, if this was for bitcoin. The manager informed me that his buddy was the investment banker for the guy who invented the bitcoin. He was unsure if he could allow the transfer. I told him that without formal notification,  he could not deny one of his customers a deposit. In the end money deposited. Extra awkwardness, teller was ex-gf from several years back. Fun times, but anyways.  
I could see this picking up speed. The tellers now know what this is and ex informed me that traffic has increased in the last couple of days.   
As for buddy being Satoshi's investment broker, I doubt it. I like to remind myself that the absence of proof is never the burdon of it. But, with that being said, I think he may be pulling my leg. 
Ps. This is in Vancouver, BC
P.P.s. Mainly applies for Canadian Bitoin'ers

I couldn't agree more.

Bummer, don't freak out. Press is press. We are on the verge team. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:23:51
Any sources on this. And if you are using Blockchain and change your Bitcoin address? Or launder? 
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:07:14
Nevermind. Back up.
