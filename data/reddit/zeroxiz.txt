I get to say I’m a billionaire at least

Do you have a source for the last sentence? Besides, I was just pointing out that you can’t say the average is false simply because you pay less.

Thanks for the in depth response, I should probably have mentioned it in the OP, but a our items are delivered instantly digitally, they cost around $1.90 a piece, and the max amount a single person could purchase would be worth $1900 aka 1000 pieces. What are the costs involved for the person double-spending, would it be worth it?

I’m aware, I was more curious about double-spending to fool merchants accepting Bitcoin without 1 confirmation being done

I see, so essentially it would be kind of a high risk with how slow it can take for a block to be discovered, and if the block confirms they would just end up with the order for the correct price at worst?

Thanks for the response, an 1 order costs $1.90, and the max one customer can order is 1000 at a time, so $1900 worth. The product is delivered instantly digitally. What would the cost for someone double-spending be? I would consider Lightning, but we’d rather start with plain blockchain transactions until our userbase is more aware about lightning, have to consider development costs.

Thanks for the reply, so what I'm gathering is that i'll allow it for orders that are small as the loss won't be too big, and wait for the 1st confirmation when the order is higher than a certain amount

Could you send it to me as well? :)
