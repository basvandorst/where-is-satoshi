It is up almost at 13400, the fuck is happening.

I think it is going to happen, maybe not in 1-2 hours, but maybe 4-6 hours.
Could be wrong, but looking at GDAX it looks like we aren't getting volume to hit that 19750 wall right now. Soon are the East Coast people going to wake up and we'll be at 20k.
Or it's going to be when we are getting CME, which is in 12+ hours.

Honestly, I've been thinking if it really is, I been saying that 0.1 bitcoin is a round number, it's a good number of money. But it's happening way too much for me to not consider it being a bot.
Could honestly not be one, but more I look it seems that it might be one.

Does someone want to make a 0.1 bot but instead it just buys every time the 0.1 bot sells, it buys that.
Just a thought.

GDAX has free fees.

So I used Coinbase, while there is a lot of slack for them being kind of shit for multiple reasons, can't deny they're are fast and sleek.
There is also Bitcoin.de, seems good from the 5 minute research that I did.
