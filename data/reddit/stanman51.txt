good luck lmao
@_date: 2018-09-07 06:09:12
So you invested 3 weeks ago? Cause anywhere before that at your fucked lmao
@_date: 2018-09-07 00:42:29
give it a year. then when your losses are even more than they are now, keep posting this and fool yourself
@_date: 2018-09-12 05:54:10
scam'em while they're young
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:57:10
if it had been showing a drop this low wouldn't yall have sold?
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:50:23
good thing he sold, back down it goes!
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:38:02
what the fuck do you mean price per bitcoin is irrelevant? nobody was interested when it jumped to 1$ then fell back down, but now everyone on earth has seen it rise and crash from 20k, and the world doesn't want the bitscam.
@_date: 2018-08-23 19:22:15
Ah nice! you earned 742$! what are you going to spend your 693$ on? maybe you could buy a new bike with that 534$
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:37:10
 Nice,  keep holding then if you are 100% sure the currency will rise past 10k ever again, even if that's not gonna happen lmao
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:45:10
what the fuck even is that graph. Im guessing its a joke?
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:14:00
Alright! that's good then if you bought back then. I'm just trying to tell people that they should make the most out of their investment if they bought after the ATH, so they don't lose more money while it falls :)
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:45:21
Depends on when you bought lmao
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:38:24
ha, you think the bubbles done popping? we got a looooong way to go
@_date: 2018-08-23 19:14:32
getting your salary switched to bitcoin is a fucking terrible idea, the chance of it dropping lower in price is massive, and you will most likely lose upwards of 50 percent of the money you make, unless you invest it quickly
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:47:03
(In july) "Guys the price falling to 4k is good for bitcoin don't even worry how much you've lost."
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:46:04
Because it's gonna die
@_date: 2018-08-23 19:18:49
Haha! see! bitcoin isn't so bad! you only lose 67% of your money instead of 96%!
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:35:24
I shorted once at 8k a month ago,  never bought any crypto

@_date: 2018-05-23 04:45:48
ay lmao so much for that
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:34:37
Lmao this shit sinking like cement shoes
@_date: 2018-08-23 19:20:22
except the 70% fall for the last 8 months lmao

Without popularity it'll drop like a rock
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:40:02
wait really? that's 800 dollars a week (providing it doesn't drop anymore) i'd think it'd be much much less
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:36:47
Haha it's even lower than that now
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:51:15
nice! i'm always happy to hear when people get out ahead.
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:04:40
Comparing bitcoin to a dead 10 year old meme seems about right
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:44:24
"from the future" Looks bad short term. If it goes below 7.6k I’ll be selling my my trade stack.
@_date: 2018-05-25 03:36:38
3 days about. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:44:16
@_date: 2018-05-30 05:35:26
Because it's an interesting sub.  The value of a currency shouldn't be expected to rise so dramatically. So I watch 
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:30:23
Oh I think bitcoin is dying. I was just interested in this thread
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:32:38
Better set your clock to December 2017 then ��
@_date: 2019-11-21 06:09:12
then that poor child is gonna be living with a broke ass dad XD
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:07:57
Beginning of a great graduate paper on people scammed out of their money lmao.
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:09:19
nice ATL all the way down into the dirt ;)
@_date: 2018-10-25 06:03:11
hows that "tEcH bAcKeD cUrReNcY" working out now? it is really fun for me to watch it fall and all y'all dumbasses lose your money
@_date: 2018-10-16 00:58:54
haha the price is still so low, prepare for even more drops ;)
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:35:46
just like all waves, we're in the middle of the crash, right before it sinks through the sand, to disappear.
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:02:26
don't throw away your money man
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:14:55
yeah once it drops to 0 im not sure how many people will still be buying lmao
@_date: 2018-10-16 01:00:09
after 3 months of massive short gains, this one bump of a week recovery sure will get them!
@_date: 2018-06-18 06:08:21
the part past the final area where the graph drops to 0
@_date: 2018-10-08 06:28:32
"as soon as we get another bull run" lot of optimism there lol
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:05:04
Would you use the U.S. dollar if whatever you had today could be worth 2/3 what it was yesterday?
The biggest proponent of a currency is stability.
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:28:03
6K* never try to estimate bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-10 04:45:06
I didn't say every currency was stable, I said that you Want a currency to be stable. Obviously a poorly managed, highly random currency like the Zimbabwe dollar, is nearly worthless, just like bitcoin in a few years
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:14:03
cant wait to see you post the exact same thing but for when its sub 5000
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:09:37
oh no, I shorted bit a few times and am very happy with my investment.
@_date: 2018-06-10 04:42:58
The USD is backed by the Government and its control over the largest military in the world, hence the reason its price doesn't go down when people switch to other currencies.
@_date: 2018-06-18 06:10:31
that meme graph is a great way to invest your money
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:33:11
to say "I told you so" in a few months mostly
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:54:07
Fuck it might not even take a single year with the current trend
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:10:09
so by 2024 returns will be around -90%
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:06:03
and now its back down to 6100
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:48:37
Far ahead eh?
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:55:49
Nvm change that to 5 days lmao y'all losing money
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:02:58
if it goes to 5000 buy more, then when it goes to 4000 buy more, then when it goes to 3000 buy more, soon when it dies for good you will have all the wonderful chucky cheese tokens online you want
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:51:31
more like you have to wait forever, the price will never rise above 10k again
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:45:01
once inflation catches up in 2080 and bitcoin is worth around 8k
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:00:11
You don't need to believe me, my investments don't rely on some redditors belief. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:48:08
lmao you're a fucking idiot
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:08:48
bravo my argument is ruined! back when bitcoin had no exposure i'm sure many people were wrong, but bitcoin has been in the public eye for a few months now and I think the professionals opinion is a little bit more credible now
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:01:53
freak out and panic sell for 5 months?
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:17:00
these 5 months of "market manipulation" sure are nuts
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:17:38
That means nothing to people who didn't buy a year ago
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:54:13
This article says the tulip trade wasn't a myth, just that its economic impact was very minor.
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:01:31
you'd rather lose everything, than double your investments?
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:09:32
Nice try finding a restaurant that's still open during that large a crash.
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:53:07
so your saying that by telling people to hold, you're doing them a favor, even when the massive spike 5 months ago is barely relatable to the smaller spikes during the coins infancy?
Just because it happened before, does not mean it is guaranteed to happen again, and by pressuring people into believing that cutting their losses is being "weak" you're creating a very toxic environment.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:53:56
4k, which is high resolution
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:40:53
at least in the world cup they have a chance of profiting lmao
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:12:59
i have an idea that the population isn't interested in bitcoin anymore, and the speculative price will never rise above 10k again
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:38:54
Probably should have sold when 90% of everyone said this would happen
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:36:17
You're losing money by the second, if you happy with losing most of your profit thats fine, but it doesn't mean that selling now isn't correct
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:31:48
OOF wrong again
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:34:43
well you don't have to worry about that, lucky for you bitcoin wont be worth any "green thingies" soon enough
@_date: 2019-06-05 14:57:20
Damn, didn't think y'all would be so willing to dump on bitcoins creator
@_date: 2019-06-06 13:47:06
the year is 2023, facebookcoin or F-Coin has taken over as the most used crypto, Craig Wright is recognized as the real Satoshi, and bitcoin's price falls to 12 cents
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:10:58
lmao remove the "k" from your prediction and you're spot on!
@_date: 2018-11-09 20:39:21
The "mainstream way of writing functions and suck"? that's one of the dumbest sentences i've read all month.
@_date: 2018-11-30 02:39:08
well, shit there it goes
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:21:52
buying at 10k before or after the bubble started popping?
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:38:47
well shit, I know I'm not psychic, but if theoretically you had sold when these comments were made, and bought back now, you'd have around 50% more bitcoin than you currently do
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:40:30
What if there is no ride up to 100k? Just like any currency it will have a fixed price, and with the amount of Bitcoin currently being traded, there's very little reason to believe the price will ever be above 15k again, let alone 100k
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:01:30
not in 6 months
@_date: 2018-11-30 02:40:45
nice advise brewski, hopefully he didn't listen or he literally just threw away half of whatever he spent.
@_date: 2018-11-09 20:49:05
"makes no sense to sell anymore" Sure it does, if you had proof that the price was going to drop, the rational choice would be to sell. Even if your in it for 5 year returns, selling before a drop, then buying back in at a lower price is always advantageous.
@_date: 2019-01-28 21:06:31
by then the price will be sub 1k XD
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:59:55
3 DAYS after you post btc is resistant to forking it FORKS AGAIN HAHAHAHA.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:59:17
LMAO you got 4k after 3 days.
@_date: 2019-01-02 01:17:03
how much would you have to put in for there to be an 85% drop and you still have 80% of your money in?
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:23:12
Which would mean the man aboves statement of rising to 100k is, at the very least extremely unlickely, as if it is supposed to behave like a currency in the future, then it will be subjigated to inflation just like everything else.
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:16:06
*Price drops 1000 dollars* "tHiS iS gOoD fOr BiTcOiN"
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:42:43
People that sold in December/ January provably don't regret it now that the price is down 70% lmao
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:01:52
yesterdays drops sure were organic lmao
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:43:40
Welp, its been almost 6 months, how are those lambos?
@_date: 2019-01-28 21:08:25
have fun losing the rest
@_date: 2019-01-28 23:39:20
eww you looked through my comment history to validate your argument? lmao haven't had that happen before!
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:50:20
Im excited for 2019's 1800!
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:13:09
50$! cant wait
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:31:13
have fun losing all your money
@_date: 2019-01-17 23:52:42
have fun hitting 20$
@_date: 2018-11-18 22:44:11
lmao store of value that has dropped 70% of its value.
EDIT: 80%
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:19:41
because it would be very unlikely for a rise like late 2017 to happen again. The world has seen what bitcoin does to its bagholders and wants out.
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:44:43
Damn son, if only you had listened to the overwhelming majority the crash might not be on you ;)
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:46:16
lmao really on track to the dirt!
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:11:46
can't wait for my internet bucks to be recognized as real! XDDD
@_date: 2019-01-02 01:15:54
damn, sorry but the money machine broke :/
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:31:19
because your average human doesn't have a time machine
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:54:08
But what if drop further? 
or what if crash server? 
many thing not known, 
but holder is always alone
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:23:29
This, never expect bitcoin to do anything, for all we know, it could drop to 500$ in the next month
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:49:20
What if, instead, they sold all of it around December, and then decided the market was too unpredictable and just kept their profit
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:58:38
Smart to at least cut losses early,  don't beat yourself up about not selling, many investment beginners did the same 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:07:36
Bitcoin dropping like a stone in the mariana trench
@_date: 2019-01-28 21:06:13
"We are literally at the lowest point" wow will this comment age poorly, ill come back when its sub 3k to laugh
@_date: 2019-01-01 18:45:37
Bitcoin is still really expensive, it'll  be nice in a year when I can get a whole bitcoin for a lunch's worth of money
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:56:39
Wew! back below 8k!
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:46:52
freak out and panic sell for an entire year?
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:56:58
You do know its not guaranteed to rise back to 20k right? for all purposes it could stabilize here, or even lower
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:41:51
I've been memeing about how shit the price is going to be for the past 7 months, now I reap what I sow and make more memes. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:12:34
Its understandable it could one day become an actual currency, if the massive amount of variance in the price stops, but due to the amount of bitcoin in use, and that many people realizing that the price could only hold 20k+ for a small amount of time before popping, will severely limit its use
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:57:38
fuckin RIP
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:09:24
Bitcoin isn't a snowcone stand, these trends are most likely entirely coincidental and a terrible way to hedge your bets
@_date: 2018-03-31 09:02:39
Hah hows that 30k looking?
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:01:18
Why the fuck didn't you sell when it dropped to 13k, 
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:29:06
Still has a growing supply
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:41:35
Yes because what happened in the past MUST happen again, and all markets follow an extremely predictable trend!
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:34:03
god I hope you don't hold, no "correction" is over 10k
@_date: 2018-07-10 17:06:05
Too late for that, tether would have to print a shitload to get it even near that price ever again
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:18:31
so your saying it going up to 20k was a correction and won't happen again? great!
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:48:10
calling it, bitcoin price 5k in 3 days
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:28:02
So that's why after 2009 all the banks are gone and only new ones exist?  Even in such a massive crisis the security of the banks was untouched 
@_date: 2018-07-07 06:03:22
You do knew that when a bank for a bankrupt, it's assets are bought by other banks right? As long as loans are being cobtrolled and people store money the banking system cannot go bankrupt.
@_date: 2018-07-07 06:04:44
The fact that in the past crypto was a niche, but now everyone sees how easily you can be burnt on it and the large population is no longer interested. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 05:50:19
You do know gold has physical value right? 
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:10:12
WOMP back down it goes lmao.
@_date: 2018-07-06 05:46:54
I guess by 2022 lambs must be crazy cheap cause I don't think 2000$ bitcons will by it
@_date: 2018-07-06 05:42:10
Well,  many fuats are backed by enormous amounts of legislature and the government's military and economic power
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:24:55
They were smart to not hold on after the obvious MASSIVE BUBBLE back then
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:46:40
by selling now and buying back after its crashed fully it a few months, or the people who were lucky enough to purchase it long ago, and sell it during the massive rise December.
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:26:33
It's a horribly toxic community though, rather than cut losses they tell them to hold on and deepen the problem
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:05:08
future man here, no moon just mantle
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:38:13
Womp womp, that didn't go anywhere
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:08:42
whoops, sorry, its hard to tell what is and isn't a joke on this sub anymore.
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:59:36
she will, and probably should, never let that go lmao
@_date: 2018-04-08 05:03:55
that post makes no sense, the drop was to the low 6000's not to 8000, also a graph like this makes no fucking sense in the first place
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:39:31
You could, if you were a separate country, or owned a private militia sell some of it,  sure. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 00:31:15
footage of the indecent and proof? small claims court?
@_date: 2018-04-08 05:00:58
back to 30$ lmao
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:07:56
because some people are going to lose a LOT of money when this crashes
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:04:06
one year ago you were close to 1000, 4 months ago you were close to 20000, now your happy with a jump to 7200?
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:04:13
Wow! what even is that graph lmao, its like he just drew a straight line from the start to the end without any consideration of the bumps or drops?
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:26:50
Its not a very good graph when it completely ignores 70% of the data its  supposed to be representing.
@_date: 2018-07-10 20:07:29
yes because in 2013 there was a massive amount of exposure for bitcoin, ad the world market was focused in on it. I'm sure the several thousand people back then were playing in the EXACT SAME MARKET as you are now.
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:53:40
have fun when it plateau at 3k ;) Ill be back in 2 years when bitcoin is bottom barrel lmao
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:04:51
toooooo late
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:22:47
Ah yes, how finances work, "If it happened before it MUST happen again!" also if you sell before it drops one IS better than the other, because you turn a profit which you can then buy back in later at a lower price.
@_date: 2019-05-31 05:06:49
Yeah it'll skip straight to 4k
@_date: 2019-05-31 04:58:51
How did you make it back from 12k?
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:56:08
wait "nearly guaranteed to get better", never mind, you're beyond help.
@_date: 2018-12-16 20:33:21
the only way it'd go straight to zero is if it were an exit scam, this was a bubble plain and simple, and some think it's still popping
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:31:32
when did you invest? and did you say you are investing donations?
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:06:32
You should have good luck with taxes with all the losses from bitcoin crashing to 5$ by 2025
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:42:01
