Can you use the "manage your own keys" option in Coinbases vault (online) in conjunction with a hardware wallet?  I have a Ledger device (nano s 2), but I'm a bit confused as to how this works.  Is it a bad idea to even keep a vault online, and I should be using the ledger device alone instead? (I haven’t used the ledger yet, because I don't fully understand what I'm doing yet).

Can you explain the owning the keys bit?  I have some btc at Coinbase, and I've really only been in this for about a month.  I've moved what i have into their vault, and own a portable ledger drive, but haven't used it yet, because I'm afraid to hose something, or lose what I have in the process.  
What's the safest way to proceed (going forward, and managing my own keys)?

Can you store coins in more than one place at a time?  I saw the option to manage my own keys via Coinbase too... but can I store the same btc online and on a portable wallet?  I got one of those 52 dollar usb ledgers with the display (per the pinned welcome info in this sub).  Im interested in the most secure, and redundant solution, and I trust a USB solution less than an online vault  (due to how many flash drives I've killed over time).

Aren't we like messing with foreign economies (and buddy buddy with the Saudis) so that they'll deal in US currency?

That's good to know.  Is it safe to keep backups online somewhere (google drive etc), or should these be in offline devices.  Also (two more questions... I realize this isn't the noobs sub)...   Coin can only be in one place at a time (aside from back-ups), right?  Also, do you have a good resource / url for good key management practices?  I'm pretty technically capable, just not knowledgeable enough on this subject, or the current vulnerabilities.  Thanks again!

Mike?  I've got a ticket that's 3 days old now with no response.  Should I submit a new ticket?

Ive tried twice with them to do the same, and I've given up ..
