That is the situation at the moment. 
The question is, what happens if important people in government in finance actually *do* get. I expect the FUD machine to ramp up at that point. There will be talk about organized crime, money laundering and terrorism via Bitcoin. 
Our side desperately needs prepared panelists for when the media calls. The media just wants a story and heated discussions, and we can't afford to lose the soundbite war.

The amount of fiat money you decide to have relative to the amount of bitcoin should be independent of how much you put in initially. 
**Edit: longer explanation**
So there are two possible outcomes in the future
1. Bitcoin surges: Why didn't I put all my money into bitcoin?
* Bitcoin crashes: Why didn't I pull out completely?
Naturally nobody knows the outcome, so it's smart to insure against (2) and put some aside in fiat money. But that has nothing to do with the initial investment. It is psychologically comforting to think "Oh well at least I didn't lose anything", but not rational. 
In essence, you are back to square one. All the money you put into bitcoin *after* cashing out your initial investment is investment as well. 
Cashing out the initial investment and putting money back in after that is equivalent to not getting back initial the initial investment.

Why is the initial investment relevant? The only thing that counts is your assessment at the moment. The money you didn't make is loss as well.

[His book]( has some excellent chapters on behavioral economics. Can't recommend it enough. 
I think Nassim Taleb's books touch on that effect as well.

Maybe both, maybe neither. It is a Bitcoin transaction.

I completely agree, I'm just saying that diversification shouldn't be dependent on the initial investment. 
If I put 10$ in 2010 and had no other assets, just cashing out my initial 10$ and keeping the rest as bitcoin would be stupid. 
If I put in 1000$ right now should I also cash out 1000$ immediately? 
You should basically have a healthy mix at any point in time, regardless on what your financial situation was in the past.

Why do you think that?

You still say "I'll make my money back" as if bitcoin wasn't real money ;-)
