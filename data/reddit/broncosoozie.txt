The issue has been known since 2011. While that's not really an excuse for Bitcoin devs to have not fixed it by now, why is MtGox the only one that seems to be blaming Bitcoin when they could be relying on more information than just the transaction id? Bitstamp and others have resolved the issue and haven't taken to blaming Bitcoin.
While I do think the blame for the transaction malleability issue most definitely lies with Bitcoin, MtGox should be able to fix the issue on their end by not relying on transaction id alone instead of what seems to be saying "Welp, we're blocked until this issue gets sorted out, thanks Bitcoin devs!".  That's what it feels like to me, anyway.

Ah, darn, little bit too tall and not quite the width/depth I was looking for.  Wait, hold on, the Barcelona table has the same dimensions, but the picture makes it look a lot taller.  I was talking about the LC10 Square one.  Does that one have the same dimensions?
The tulip one is not really my style, but thanks anyway.  However, I noticed that doesn't have dimensions on your site either.  If I were you, I'd make sure your site gets updated so that anyone who is potentially interested knows how big it is.

Looks like some pretty nice stuff.  I might be interested in the short square coffee table, but there's no dimensions listed on it so I don't know if it would fit or if it's big enough for what I'm looking for.  Do you know if you'll have any other products similar to this coming? Something not made of glass, maybe?
