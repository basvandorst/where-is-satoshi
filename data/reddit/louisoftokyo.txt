Fees are cuurently 5-10 cents to get into the next block.

Checking the GPS on the photos I took and retracing my steps on Google Street View, I figured out that it was [Mahollo Cafe](  inside a place called [Chichibu Omotesando Lab]( in the town of Chichibu.

Totally agree.

Why did the payment fail? It's an off-chain transaction.

What inconveniences does it create? You can create transactions between any pair of bech32, P2SH and P2PKH addresses can't you?

Nothing, as far as I'm aware, because it's not on-chain. But I made an on-chain transaction later that day with a 7 cent fee which confirmed in 2 minutes.

I tried for a while to find the transaction ID so I could look up everything but I couldn't. But because I was annoyed that I couldn't pay using bitcoin myself due to mine being in cold storage, that night I transferred some to a hot wallet for future use, and the default fee of 3.4 sat/byte (~7 cents) got it in the next block 2 minutes later. So assuming bitFlyer's fee estimation is up to scratch, probably around that.

I'm the decidedly less pretty man holding the camera.

She and another female friend were the ones that got me into it. They are both Korean and crypto is huge there as everyone knows.

I'm not sure exactly how it works with these bitFlyer terminals, but the actual bitcoin transaction is wrapped up behind the scenes, so I don't think it would be possible to double spend. With these terminals the merchant accepts 0-conf because I imagine that bitFlyer is taking that risk on itself.

It's bitFlyer, which is basically the coinbase of Japan.
