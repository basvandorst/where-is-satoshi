Why post this with such a misleading title. It's chocolate..
@_date: 2018-09-13 23:56:01
Bitcoin has hit low 6k like 6times now with major support I think it's a pretty safe bet
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:15:27
Dude bitcoins been lower than 7k 3 separate times and back up since it hit 20k. You have no idea what it's going to do just like everybody else. Sit back and relax and stop trying to figure the market out short term
@_date: 2018-08-09 18:11:42
What's with all these reddit accounts that are a day old posting things like this. Not saying I  disagree with you but everytime I see any kind of "negative" things posted it's always somebody new
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:20:05
Buy a 1t hard drive for like 50bucks lol. Why do you only have 10max?
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:12:32
Well plus bitcoin isnt physical like a pair of Nike shoes...
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:03:17
It's an analogy.. it wouldnt be digital lead because lead is cheap and not scarce. Dont take it so  literally lol.
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:04:38
It is the middle of the week..
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:02:10
Not tell people you have 130btc lol
@_date: 2018-05-21 23:17:36
But there are 17million bitcoin.. lol
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:57:58
What about Arizona? Thought they were first
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:52:29
It's a proven thing holding is the most profitable for the average person. Unless you have tons of time to watch the charts and price movement and actually know how to trade.
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:56:16
Read my post again. Most people dont have the time to constantly watch charts and on top of that you never know where the bottom or top is and you can easily get burned. You must be new to this.
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:28:33
So you're a bitcoin maximalist. You said they are having a hard time scaling and they are not. That's fine. Just because in your opinion nothing else has to be decentralized doesn't mean your right. Obviously millions of other people dont agree with you or else there wouldn't be any other projects operating at all. I'm not gonna waste my time teaching you something you can research yourself since you have such an ignorant attitude towards the whole thing.
@_date: 2018-05-14 08:59:06
Your question is impossible to answer and kind of a pointless one as well. And the right way to talk about crypto is to talk about the tech and how it can make life better. Not to talk about the sick gains bro.
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:15:15
Be patient man. These type of articles posted everywhere do nothing but plague reddit with negativity. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 18:11:03
If it became the global currency we would be paid in crypto..
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:58:28
Glad he was found alive. Thanks for updating everyone. I dont understand why this was shared so much though. People are kidnapped and held for ransom all the time with other ways of payment as well. Has nothing to do with bitcoin itself
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:17:50
How is the  price still diminishing. It's been bouncing between 6 and 8k for months now. Not much change really lol
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:44:42
Awesome idea for a shirt man
@_date: 2018-05-01 19:50:28
Who cares what kanye says. Only positive is that's he's a celebrity talking about bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:50:24
This guy had been fudding for the last two days all over the place
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:28:50
Last one was delayed not rejected. It's a big deal and I get they want to make sure its gonna work. Not bearish news at all. I dont get why people are freaking out over a delay. It means they are actually trying 
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:10:15
It's really not that low though.. same value as last October November.. with btc the same value as that time as well. You are thinking short term.. you got banned because what you said is basically considered manipulation.
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:30:48
Research power ledger and tell me how that can run without a decentralized network
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:05:15
Man not hot, never hot
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:17:16
That's what people said last time and it shot right back up instantly 
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:16:57
I agree there are high fees.. But it's a positive thing because it shows adoption and makes people feel more comfortable investing if they see it during their every day lives.
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:15:49
Lol. You have some more research to do buddy. Yeah there are scams, but everything isnt about scalability. And bitcoin devs aren't having an issue at all. It's called lightning network and things take time to implement. Once that is in place bitcoin will be able to do millions of tps
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:09:05
What about the coins not meant to be a currency...
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:50:53
Lol. So you just contradicted yourself. You said no other projects will remain. I never said all coins will make it. Obviously not the case. 95% will fail. But this is just the beginning and alot will happen before even the project that will end up failing to to 0
@_date: 2018-05-07 12:01:55
I can read other reddit predictions and act like I made them myself too.. nobody knows man. Ride the wave.
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:19:22
Idk about you but I take TA with a grain of salt. You can find graphs with people saying things are gonna moon or crash for basically every coin. If your projects are fulfilling what they say they are gonna do and making progress with adoption then you have nothing to worry about
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:59:20
So you got lucky once big deal lol. Btc could of just easily dropped from 9.8k to 9.6k then shot right over 10k in an instant and you would of lost out.
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:54:09
Il buy it
@_date: 2019-03-19 10:33:21
This is misleading. Visa's tps is about 24,000. Less than half of what's stated. Still a huge difference and  obviously Bitcoin needs work, but at least give accurate information.
@_date: 2019-03-05 21:53:17
Many of the top addresses haven't moved any funds in 6+years and some may be lost.
@_date: 2019-03-15 00:05:18
Hahaha one of the benefits of crypto is to be interoperable. Give me a break.

@_date: 2019-03-06 12:05:25
When miners stop getting block rewards they get rewarded with transaction fees and that won't happen for like 100years. Mining is technically unprofitable right now for most, but when there are less miners there is more incentive to mine because less hash power is needed.
@_date: 2019-03-19 16:24:16
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:12:29
They clearly are. Adoption is happening all over the world everyday, slowly but surely.
@_date: 2019-03-06 15:04:41
All Bitcoin will be mined by the year 2140. It's cut in half every 4 years. All that means is that mining will become even more decentralized since the big players will deem it not worth while. Still what I said is correct
@_date: 2019-03-21 18:03:01
This doesn't make sense at all
@_date: 2019-03-22 10:22:45
The price went down 80+% wtf are you talking about. Reddior for 2days... Explains everything I need to know.
@_date: 2019-03-07 20:55:55
Explains why mining will become way more competitive in the coming years
@_date: 2019-03-19 20:23:45
This is awesome
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:05:40
You can't measure btc in Satoshis vs us dollars lol. Satoshis are fragments of Bitcoin. That only works with alts

@_date: 2018-06-06 14:08:33
This sub is toxic? but yet your are here lol. What a negative view of the whole situation. Yeah people who didn't understand anything about bitcoin or blockchain just threw money at it and lost tons but you cant speak for everyone. There are many positive things coming from this revolution, sorry you cant see that. You must of been one of those people from the younger generation that threw money at bitcoin and lost it all. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:54:23
Bitcoin failed to dip below 6k 3 times now. I think its pretty safe to say there's some strong resistance there 
@_date: 2018-06-01 01:19:51
Yeah this is really cool
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:37:55
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:08:55
How is it fake if it's real?
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:14:50
They are bearish but so many of these hedge funds and huge companies are getting involved? Kinda contradicting themselves there. I don't agree with that at all.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:33:24
No.. it means that that purchase isn't like your normal purchase activity probably since it's out of the country and they wanna make sure you made it.
@_date: 2019-02-12 15:10:34
And even so, with a gold mc of around 7trillion, not very big considering the world-wide GDP is more than 280trillion.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:07:28
Well the whole point of "HODLING" is to not ever sell and that at a point Bitcoin and certain crypto in general with be used and you can just spend it directly.
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:52:32
That's bullshit. Might slow it down but once a new hype cycle starts and new capital rushes in it can't be stopped. In that sense futures would stop the stock market from rising like it has been as well.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:39:30
The average Joe doesn't have access to a bank account, which makes PayPal unusable. You have to think of it at a much larger scale. And even with people that do have access to bank account, transferring money across borders comes with many fees which makes it more expensive than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-28 15:11:25
And this is the problem with half of the people in crypto .... even 6x gains in ten years is outstanding. Beats the average of the stock market by far
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:40:51
Couldn't it just as easily go the other way and they all go long. Wouldn't they benefit more making money on the longs and on the actual price being substantially higher? 
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:56:36
I'm also aloud to have my own opinion.  Even if it only makes it to 12,500 that's still a pretty good bullrun if you ask me.
@_date: 2019-02-12 15:05:21
Most people except btc will be worth 1usd? What a wild and inaccurate assumption lol. That's definitely not the common belief. You named a reason yourself in this post why thats the case. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:24:04
They don't control all the hedge funds/pension/retirement funds that want to get involved. All private companies.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:22:22
No licence is needed lol. Sell it at the same place you bought it from not very complicated. Some countries have regulatory problems but besides that it's free game.
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:40:37
Dude do you know how many private family owned businesses there are that do this. There are two that I know of within 20 miles of where I live. I'm not disagreeing that they are gonna try and manipulate what's going on but they don't have full control like you think. I'm not the naive one if you have all this experience and still think like that. 
Here's one example
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:32:36
I mean yeah risk is a factor but we are talking past performance.. so it worked out
@_date: 2019-06-11 02:01:33
Any points you would gain would be counteracted by the 3-5% fee for purchasing with a credit card..
@_date: 2019-02-21 15:09:26
He also said the dotcom bubble which wouldn't be all stocks. Only online companies, and not all of them produced goods to sell. But yeah crypto is missing the revenue aspect at this time for the most part
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:25:50
No problem man. Goodluck!
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:46:57
Lol I couldn't care less what you do. The only thing that can bring it down is shorts. All the hedge funds, potential ETFs, and retirement funds will only help. Good luck. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 15:12:16
Not gonna argue with you if you're just gonna repeat that over and over again. It's an easy google search away to find that your are very wrong. But you are gonna believe what you want.

You're not satisfied about the 30%profit? Nobody cares about what you made lol. If everybody posted the trades they made it would be one pointless sub. People use Reddit to find and share info. But to each their own..
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:26:33
Bitcoin dipped 4% after going up 30%, it was expected. Your post is just as dumb as they posting about going to the "moon".
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:12:34
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:27:18
Great points and post man thanks!
@_date: 2019-04-03 18:06:35
That's the same mindset I have. Most of us have been patient so far so even if it dips back down whatever. Better than missing another rally
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:07:53
Not really... People freak out and sell their bags. That's why it drops 90% to begin with.
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:07:47
The thing is exchanges are businesses. If they feel like that coin and/or the person running it isn't up to par then they have every right to delist. There are other ways to get that coin besides the major ones and soon when Dex exchanges become more popular any coin can be listed on there without that worry.
@_date: 2019-04-22 01:19:40
I can't tell if this is actually a real question or if you're just trolling lol..
@_date: 2019-04-19 09:49:40
And.. what's the point of telling us this lol
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:24:48
The things is it's not a stock. You can't say where the market is going based on charts long term. That only helps short term if that.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:12:36
Don't get ahead of yourself man. We are still down like 35% in the past 2 weeks alone lol
@_date: 2018-11-07 01:43:53
Fear of missing out
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:29:03
Youll be able to spend many cryptos with a card just like credit but with no bank. You really don't know what your talking about. Many of your points are off
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:01:15
Shit post
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:25:46
Well maybe your next post won't be so shitty. We are really interested in what your "professor" has said lol.. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:31:59
Usd backed crypto wouldn't be decentralized since the company would have to physically have the equal worth in cash. Making it controlled by whoever owns the company making it no different than a bank
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:37:21
Sell on an exchange..
@_date: 2018-11-06 13:08:42
It's beneficial that bitcoins price has been so stable for this long imo.
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:08:26
No, has nothing to do with that actually. I'm patient and am willing to wait however long it takes for the market to turn around. I didn't buy in the hype so I'm not too negative myself. It's a shit post because it's just your opinion and didn't give any reasoning at all backing it. You're entitled to your opinion but again it's pretty pointless because nobody knows what's going to happen.
@_date: 2019-01-24 02:47:54
He just said that? You with him? Lol
@_date: 2019-01-27 17:09:57
Things "cost' what people are willing to pay, this article is pointless. Nobody knows where the price is gonna end up
@_date: 2018-11-04 13:14:48
The millennials aren't the ones who moved the price like it did last year so I don't know why it focuses on that as much as it did. There was just too much exuberance and obviously alot of the projects aren't going to make it long term since there really is no need for a crypto currency but there will 100% chance of some projects coming to fruition 
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:01:51
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:55:24
Bitcoin doesn't have to be used for payments to be successful. There are way better options in coins for p2p transactions. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:53:09
No it's basically Bitcoin not being traded so it's a positive on the price
@_date: 2018-11-04 00:54:17
You don't have to hate stocks to like crypto lol
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:39:48
Oh so you're one of those guys that only buy bitcoin? What an idiot. Anyone with common sense knows buying one type of any asset is dumb. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 19:39:56
There are plenty of people that have no idea what they are doing and follow the masses. And you're right the market is very fucked up right now and isnt very viable. Hence why I just hold because nobody knows what's gonna happen. Least stressful way to participate imo
@_date: 2018-07-27 17:41:07
Welcome man. Where are you located?
@_date: 2018-07-05 19:21:42
My point is posting a negative meme with no substance at all does nothing but help create a more negative vibe throughout the whole community. I'm very comfortable with my holdings actually 
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:07:48
Posting things like this accomplish nothing. Bitcoin price is down 2%, big deal. It's been hovering between 6500 and 7k for days.
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:52:35
Well that's my point exactly. This isnt a party kid.
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:30:43
Lol now I'm gramps? Thought I was kid. And glad you made a few thousand but that's nothing. I'm still up even without selling anything..
@_date: 2018-07-19 16:19:27
There are actually a few companies trying to solve this already
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:53:55
He doesn't understand what bitcoin even is and that it doesn't matter if bitcoin hits 1million since it's broken down into sats anyway.. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:31:13
No I mean blockchain..when i said come here i meant reddit in general
@_date: 2018-07-20 23:51:19
They have a 30 day grace period after August 10th
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:53:37
Lol big deal dude that's nothing. Its dropped 150$ since you posted this 4 days ago. When it's under 5k then il start worrying. Its tested under 6k multiple times and shoots right back
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:02:52
That's a very nice way to think of it. Thanks for your perspective, didn't think of it like that
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:01:40
Just use coinbase
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:18:52
Sorry I take my finances seriously. Maybe I have more than 200$ invested so I dont waste time posting negative memes that have no substance to it at all and come here to learn more about blockchain
@_date: 2018-07-10 11:41:08
This is what people are talking about when they say the space has to "mature"
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:21:47
Why wouldnt they just ban it if they weren't contemplating approving the etf? 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:37:28
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:39:12
I never had any issues with BOA and crypto. Even talked to one of the managers about it.
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:29:22
This is how you know it's an awesome time to be involved with bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:39:25
That's exactly what I said. Your title is just out of context. Make it seem like they aren't trying to do so which they are. Maybe not usd but definitely are attempting to make other pairings which will come in time. Won't happen overnight
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:25:26
Are you kidding me? They can do anything they want
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:24:08
You can't compare it to last years really. So much has happened in the past year. With all the media coverage, good or bad, still puts crypto in people minds. Alot more going on behind the scenes we dont even know about. And there really isn't a reason for it to drop low fundamentally. Most news is positive right now.
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:11:41
Not exactly fake.. your title is misleading. Nothing is confirmed yet. Binance announced they are trying to work with banks to make fiat pairs happen. Nothing is confirmed yet 
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:16:46
Alright dude you know everything. Not gonna argue with somebody so ignorant. Do you not realize most funds are not on hot wallets so most crypto exchanges hold can't even be stolen from? And yeah coinbase is one of the most reputable, proven by userbase. Good day sir
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:10:54
Never said anything about that. It wasn't a hack on binance itself, it was a hack on the users themselves.  And you are wrong coinbase is federally insured 250k each wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:18:57
So you think Bitcoin is gonna drop into the 3500 region again?
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:28:19
Yeah exactly it goes both ways for sure. But that's never gonna stop it happens in all news sources, not just with crypto. People have opinions. You just have deduct the facts from whatever you read and make your own decisions basically
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:44:57
That's a great perspective
@_date: 2018-12-03 00:22:03
It's not free it's between 10 and 15 years depending on what system you have and how much sun. And that number is going down exponentially every year. Solar panels are being produced much cheaper with a better extraction of energy since even like two years ago. You're the one who hasn't even done a simple Google search
@_date: 2018-12-02 12:19:02
Lol are you serious? 500 years? What are you on?
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:20:38
Better off waiting to sell it anyway. But if you really want to get rid of it now you could probably just buy something with it like gift cards or on overstock
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:20:41
I mean imo it matters what sources you're getting your information at. I see plenty of positive news everyday too. There are a lot of BS site out there just spreading fud but you can find that with any news source. Everyone does have an agenda you just have to find the most unbiased sources. Its hard to pick through all the Reddit posts and find accurate info I'll give you that
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:55:59
Don't even give these websites your time. They are absolutely just guessing. Nobody knows what's going to happen, especially to the exact dollar like they claim. You can't base a projects price off just TA. Fundamentals are a huge part as well, especially in the longer term.
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:24:19
How did you inherit Bitcoin on an account that wasn't verified to originally have Bitcoin lol?
@_date: 2018-12-03 00:15:19
Dude people wouldn't be putting them on there houses all over the world if there wasn't incentive financialy. Solar energy is getting cheaper and cheaper every year
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:24:26
In that sense anything can be hacked if it isn't managed properly..
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:57:53
Or the news of currency adoption at over 30,000 locations..

I totally agree with you but not for nothing if you are on a reputable exchange like binance with this recent hack for instance, no customers lost any funds. Its all replaced. Just like a bank it's insured if it's their fault

You didn't really give a reason why besides saying people are buying because they think it's gonna go up. Isn't that why everyone buys it? Lol

Well your calculations come out to 500 years. Why would anyone in there right mind do that then. I don't need to waste my time doing calculations when I can easily look it up or use common sense..

Well my point is even if you move you Bitcoin off the exchange and you don't manage it properly it can be stolen.. it's entirely dependant on what precautions are taken for security. The whole space is still new. These kinks will be worked out. For example, a hundred years ago people were able to rob Banks for all they are worth, now people are lucky to get a few thousand dollars from a teller. Things evolve and change once problems are identified and figured out.
