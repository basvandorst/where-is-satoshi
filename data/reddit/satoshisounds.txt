That used to be the case but around 5 years ago buying homes in China with cash started trending down, buying with mortgages trending up. And those trends are speeding up fast.

Typically the Guardian misguides its audience as its team can't get basic facts straight - notice how the byline reads "South Korea's Coincheck", whereas the main article references "South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinrail" and "Japan's coincheck". I wonder if the editor knows which information is correct.

Thanks for the explanation, I understand the push/pull idea... pretty much...
So imagine I'm a merchant and I advertise an item for sale at 1 bitcoin. A buyer agrees the sale and sends me 1 bitcoin, but I receive 1 bitcoin minus the fee, right?

YSK the Guardian has a track record of deliberately publishing misinformation and fake news - see their wikipedia and elsewhere. They need to be held accountable to basic journalistic standards, there's no need to make unfounded excuses for them. Learn to interpret the bias, or remain misguided and misinformed.

A typo is generally understood to be a slip of the fingers - an incorrect keystroke resulting in incorrect spelling (or tense, or lexical omission). What happened here is use of an incorrect term, which results in incorrect information - not due to a slip of the fingers, but due to a lack of knowledge related to subject matter.

Don't forget though that this FB drop coincides with the dawning realisation that FB just means messenger to the vast majority of Western-hemisphere users now. That's a very big shift away from writing on walls, or poking. FB shares don't even represent the same product as was floated at its IPO. Highly, highly uncertain future.

I'll explain: it's because nobody is willing to give it away for free, while many people are willing to buy it at market price.

He said he bought loads of different coins, not just bitcoin

I may be wrong here, but I believe that using the Lightning Network negates high fees and long transaction times.
