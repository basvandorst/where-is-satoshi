Wow, could you be a little more aggressive? Purse has hundreds of thousands of successful transactions with what I would assume is an error rate of less than 1% and you've got your pitchfork out? This isn't a blockchain enforceable contract, it's people running a business.. mistakes occur occasionally and purse seems to be doing a semi-decent job monitoring those issues. It might be time to relax a little.

I expect more from you. Bitcoin has been resilient for six years, this democratic exercise of implementing open source code will only strengthen bitcoin in the long run. I admit that I see the senior devs being trolled by some asshats, but it's better to have this discussion then ignore it.

Bitcoin is a currency similar to the US Dollar or CAD (or any other currency). You can hold it, share it, buy goods and services, or exchange it for another currency. 
Time is on your side - if you're not sure what to do with it just pay attention when you hear tidbits about bitcoin and in a few weeks or months you'll develop a much better understanding.

Could not disagree more. Most kids will throw it away. No big deal. But a few kids are curious enough to learn more about bitcoin and plant a seed. Some of them will take the $10 and hold it for awhile to see it change every day. One of those hundred kids might start accumulating - maybe even by bartering with other kids to get more coins. If that $1000 changes a couple of kids lives by introducing them to bitcoin than it's a win. There are many people in this space that have been here for nearly 10 years and $1000 in bitcoin is no big deal to them.

If I recall correctly, the hardfork went off without incident and it wasn't even planned for/expected. Our current situation is that we're dying the death of a thousand cuts because we're afraid to take medicine. Hard forks are known to be a part of this process, but the fear of them has been wildly exaggerated. I believe we could pull off a hard fork in the next 12 hours if a decision were made to move forward.

These questions might be better suited for but hell, I'm here so I'll give it a swing:
bitcoin is more anonymous than credit cards or paypal the problem is this is not important to me that much


bitcoin is safer to transfer over the internet than credit cards and paypal


    
the security weakness of bitcoin is the wallet not in the transfer of cash (besides scams)


Why do you use bitcoin?


How much bitcoin do you store at a given time?


What do you usually purchase with bitcoin?


I do not own any bitcoin myself. Essentially I want to know if it is worth my time to consider using. If there is anything that I am misunderstanding or points i'm missing please tell me.

Be aware... there is no place (that I am aware of) to get a level discussion of this topic. The sides have been chosen and few people can speak with a neutral mindset.
So, I'll go ahead and take my downvotes. Bitcoin Classic doesn't present a problem for bitcoin, it presents a solution that bitcoin core refused to provide. When it gains enough popularity a consentual fork will occur and all parties will join the chain with the most work and things will move forward smoothly.

We can look around and see that people are dissatisfied with the trajectory of the United States.

Here is the data you're describing: 
@_date: 2015-11-24 18:00:08
The bitcoin network self-adjusts about every two weeks to make sure that blocks are mined about every 10 minutes. When difficulty goes up it means that more miners are competing for bitcoin blocks and the network has made it more difficult to mine blocks in order to maintain this 10 minute average. This affects the exchange rate (price) of bitcoin because the cost to generate coins (the production cost) is higher, so all miners will require a higher exchange rate before selling. This is conversely bad for miners because the same mining hardware will now net 10% fewer coins. The easiest way to imagine this is that the more people who try to mine new coins means that everyone will get proportionally fewer coins - the supply remains constant. (Until July, 2016).

1. In what locale are you based?
2. The copy on your homescreen says, "buy bitcoin in just three hours". That's probably good, but it's an early turnoff. Save that for a screen or two in and add a caveat that says, "coins will be securely deposited within three hours of purchase."
3. I got excited about buying a bit of coin until I saw the "big banks" that I actively avoid. I don't have an account at any of the 6 banks listed and I don't see alternatives.
4. Selling coin looks a LOT more promising. I didn't complete the process, but it appears that I can enter my account information and sell coins pretty easily. I'm going to come back when I am ready to sell some coin.

I have an excellent solution for this - there's an android app called "bitholla". It uses geolocation connected to a wallet so you never need to scan a QR code.

At any rate, check out bitholla - you will not be disappoint.

To understand the difference, you'll need to look at [the blockchain difficulty graph](
The Bitforce minirig was offered around December 2012, when difficulty was relatively low and it promised incredible returns. It's a first generation ASIC miner, and not many of them shipped - those that did ship were a year late and of poor quality. Much of the world is very put out with Butterfly labs because they promised big and delivered far later than expected.
The KNC Jupiter was formally announced MUCH later, on [September 30, 2013]( They basically shipped a product above spec 60 days after their formal announcement and are generally regarded as a very high performing company.
The nine month difference between those two miners is what accounts for the $15,000 difference in price. In December, 2012, bitcoin was a much smaller enterprise made up of VERY early adopters, most of whom had done well with GPU mining. In September 2013, the price of bitcoin had increased dramatically along with the difficulty of mining.
One way of looking at it is that if the BFL minirig had provided what it promised (when it promised), it would have been a much better deal than the $15,000 cheaper KnC Jupiter. In fact, BFL didn't ship it's first unit until [March 30, 2013]( 
Many of those dates are from memory, some could be wrong. I welcome correction.
