About 100 BTC. I am pretty stalkable if you want to help out.

About 100 that I have been spending/investing in Mexico City. Used to be the Spanish Mod, should have known better. :(
If anyone is interested in helping me out I am pretty much stalkable.

I initially contact them before the rally along Pioneer One; at the time they did not plan to support it, since they had a big workload. So this is what I would consider a quick patch. Since Pioneer One accepted donations directly I didn't even realize this up to now and as such I don't know how long it has been there.
What I can tell you is that if they start getting flooded with donations, _maybe_, they will add a proper payment processor.

Then I hope you were the guy who put down 2.5 BTC for it. I think they are still missing a few grand. Also, I will see if I can afford to get a "Thank you Bitcoin" in the video. If someone can get the opening presented by it would be awesome too!($100, or about 12 BTC) You would get a poster for yourself signed.

Also, if you can you can give a small discout; 1-2% of CC fees.

Indeed sir, mind if I push commits back to you?

Well, the worst part is their analogy.
They could have used a messenger layered analogy for Tor(Silkroad, Black Market) and a consensus on work for Bitcoin.
The back alley analogy really gets me jumpy. xD

Though to be honest this thread is way better because the poster hotlinked to the video instead of us having to search trough the post.

After looking around it looks half way done. Seems like it still needs most of the views and financial functions. ):

Too short and not too bumpy.
[Pretty sure this is a better example](

Now the final piece of the puzzle is getting in place.
The NWO is finally here! /me puts a lead hat on.
On other news a Bitcoin rally might be in the corner, just saying.
