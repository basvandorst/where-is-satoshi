The article did say it was in the Caribbean.

I really hate these comments, because I'm never sure if they're sardonic or actual accusations.  I'm not ATF[E}, if my comments are wrong (and to the extent they have been, which they clearly have as others have pointed out) I want to know.  I do have a Juris Doctorate from an Ivy League school, so I'm not completely ignorant of these issues, but I am genuinely trying to learn more about them.

And false, the manufacturer was convicted and sentenced to over six years in prison over his involvement.

Shearer was not the manufacturer, you're right, he was a similarly situated middleman, like Ver.  I don't see where he did any other stuff on top.  Shearer was doing effectively the same thing, except that he sold other fireworks as well.  Ver only sold these, but he sold them as fireworks (like Shearer) rather than as the pest control devices that they were advertised as, which is why they went after him more than the manufacturer who was failing to authenticate purchasers as farmers or otherwise qualified to purchase.

The manufacturer was sentenced to over [six fucking years in federal prison]( after his conviction for selling them.

I was mistaken that Ken Shearer was the manufacturer, but he was absolutely sentenced for selling the same thing, and a few other things which is why his sentence was much longer than yours.  He had the benefit of not committing mail fraud though, which you did do, given that the items you shipped are explicitly prohibited by USPS regulations without further certification and compliance procedures ... so there's that.

Or, you know, I don't like people walking around with false impressions.  I didn't respond to the same person three times, or just post it randomly three times, I read the article, checked up on his claims which seemed like something that would help inform an area I'm interested in, and found them to be bunk.  So I told three people who appeared to be informed otherwise.  Do you have anything of value to add?

Might as well use a bank at that point.  A major advantage of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust any individual with the key to your funds, using a service to create your public and private key reintroduces that risk variable.

Really?  Because the exhibits submitted to PACER clearly show your e-bay pages, and that disclaimer isn't displayed.

Having just read it myself, Ver is simply a liar.  Ken Shearer, the manufacturer of the fireworks, was [sentenced to over six years in federal prison]( for his actions, a little more than just "simply asked to stop selling them".
