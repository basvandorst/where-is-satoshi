Very happy for you. Hope bitcoin and cryptos give a little room for regular people like you and me.

I belong to a website. Talk about everything. 
At the stock section (because there isn’t  crypto section, yet), majority of people used to make fun of people who invest on bitcoin. Recently, every other post is about bitcoin and cryptos. We are getting there.

Great!  Wish I could tell my husband. But he is a (fiat)day trader, very conservative one. I know he is gonna try to take profit whenever he can. I want to hodl. Good luck to everyone!

I have invested in cryptos since last July and my husband doesn’t know it. I will wait for a while until I can proudly tell him about it. 
I know him so well.  Don’t want to freak him out.
