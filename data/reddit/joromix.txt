Drop in price directly affects return in meme investments.

Time to ride that 2018 upwards wave baby 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:32:28
No offense mate but I think this was funnier in your head?
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:59:25
Get in while you can, folks.

George likes his chicken spicy

Don't be an asshole, he's probably just new. Crypto is an opportunity the world hasn't seen before. We won't ever hit mainstream adoption if the community acts like this towards new investors.
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:38:48
It's a wonderful rollercoaster 
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:23:08
This is...the stupidest question I've ever seen on this sub.
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:05:39
It's... it's barely down tho
@_date: 2018-05-04 02:54:50
Lol it's a fucking joke 
@_date: 2018-10-03 07:41:11
Everyone is so negative since the fall from 20k, you all act like the price is never going back up.
Prices at this level really bring out the downers in this sub.
@_date: 2018-10-03 07:44:13
Yes it's quite refreshing too, but the comments these posts get always seem so glum, like you can tell they're particuarly salty about certain losses still...
I lost a lot too but it's not like it's never hitting 20k again, crypto is here to stay
@_date: 2018-10-22 03:39:00
This is hilarity 
@_date: 2018-10-03 07:49:50
That's the secret, everyone is bullshit 
@_date: 2019-02-27 06:46:48
That's hysterical, props to the team.
@_date: 2018-11-09 22:23:44
Lol everyone beings dicks about the illogical comparison, who gives a shit it's funny
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:53:45
...Because they control a significant portion of America's government? Idk that might have something to do with it 
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:43:39
Are you alright? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:40:34
Ooo the crypto roast
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:44:06
Thought I was reading an article title from The Onion...this is gold.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:41:20
When I start seeing top comments like this is when I start buying in.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:09:30
I thought it was "don't invest more than you're afraid to lose"?
Thanks for the vid though

Steel-clad nut saq crew turn up 
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:02:35
Really don't think the stock market has anything to do with the crypto one.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:28:10
I lol'd
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:14:31
You too man, best of luck in the investing business for you!
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:19:32
I am only about 30% in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:45:54
This is genuinely hilarious
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:47:05
What about holding on an exchange, like Binance? Classify as a mobile and insecure wallet?
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:41:45
@_date: 2018-04-23 08:18:39
Holy shit this is awesome, had no idea Gramatik was a hodler
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:25:24
In what ways does $40 trillion not make sense?
