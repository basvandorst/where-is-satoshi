My brother came into money, more than you..around 9m.  He was 8 years into his marriage.  1 teenage stepkid, 1 biological child, around 5 years old.    Combined salary was probably 150k-200k before then.  He immediately quit his job and paid off the ~400k home they'd bought a couple years before.   Wife quit her job 2 months later, decided to "home school" the biological kid.  Started spending money like it wasn't a thing.   Sends older kid to expensive private school and buys him a ~250k house by school.   Turns out she's not actually home schooling the kid, so she insists on sending him to expensive private school.    Divorce proceedings start within 1 year of the money happening.  2 year long battle over money and custody.  Older child no longer speaks to my brother (since he was against buying an 18 year old a HOUSE).
Now my brother is worth 4m (ex wife got half, no alimony or child support) and can't move out of the county because of the custody agreement (which he got screwed on btw, 2 days a week when she gets 5) until the kid is 18.   There was no choice or hiding the money so it's a different situation.
If you talk to him, he will say "the money changed everything about her".  It 100% ruined their relationship.  His ex wife grew up poor and always had poor money management skills, despite having a decent paying job as an adult (~75k in an area where that goes pretty far).

Bought 1 at $600, was so mad when it went down to $300 for so long.  Waited for...I think it was at least a year before I was able to sell it for a profit, at around $725 or so.  
Of course I put all of that into eth which was $7 then so I'm alright with the world.
