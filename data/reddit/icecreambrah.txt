What's the pro of a hardware wallet? Mobility and the extra security?

I just got into BTC through coinbase (have since bought 0.05 BTC. Made some accounts on kraken and coin square as per Reddit comment recommendations
The coinbase fees seem very high, though it is extremely easy to buy btc (though low weekly limit)
I was planning on investing in btc and possibly eth if it takes off and once I do more research of cryptos
Should I just stick to something like kraken for buying because of less fees? And just buy alt coins?

You're right

@_date: 2017-08-21 03:46:09
I bought for first time at 4280
this is all my fault I'm sorry guys
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:07:49
So basically buy alt coins and then trade for eth/btc
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:29:29
Dude I bought 250 at 4800.
When the value is almost 5k 250 is chump change, you lost what like 10-20$ 
Just chill out and buy more while it's low
