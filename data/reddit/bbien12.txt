Some people are living with their crypto-heads so up in clouds that they can’t see any different angles to that.
Enabling you BTC pay via cards (might) be very beneficial in the long run. BTC with of without visa is still BTC, right? Ask yourself
What is to lose? 
What is to gain?
My take on that is that there is nothing to lose, and worst case scenario you will be able to pay bitcoin via existing network of millions merchants worldwide.  Not a bad start to a brighter future, ay?

Correct me if I’m wrong but with all this M.A.D (mutual assured destruction) doctrine signed by almost every nation that got those weapons (especially the big boys). bitcoin is like... irrelevant?
I mean everything will be irrelevant. Most of life and world as we know it wiped out, on what is left will be waiting nuclear winter.

OP meant “wash trading”. I hope that this clarified things

If we are talking about total annihilation for what you need a locally running bitcoin? Idea behind it is to have a distributed network. 
The question is... is bitcoin still bitcoin, if not longer run on a a decentralized, distributed network?
