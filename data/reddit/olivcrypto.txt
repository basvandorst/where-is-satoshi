Privacy tip from me: Use A P2P Bitcoin buy/sell Marketplace like Fatpurchase.com, not Localbitcoins or Paxful! As Fatpurchase make sure traders aren't scammers. Send your Bitcoin to your cold storage ledger. Anonymity from the platform you purchase the Bitcoin from to where you keep it safe.

You should be using a decentralized platform or a platform that is based out of US, already free from IRS eyes and all these privacy poking issues you guys have in US. If you want your Bitcoins safe. Use a foreign platform like Fatpurchase.com, they have a marketplace, free bitcoin wallet for users and a trading platform. And I heard their bits are usually store in cold storage

Yeah. When a solution is out there and ppl hardly know. It shouldn't be hidden

I wonder why people still use Coinbase to buy Bitcoins when you can easily use secure peer 2 peer platform like Fatpurchase.com where transactions are secured I  think with that you don't have to be on your toes all the time.

P2P extorting charges? Maybe you've not heard of Fatpurchase.com. It's an hybrid coin trading Marketplace (Centralized &amp; Decentralized) where traders offer transaction fee as low as 0.5%  which in my opinion is way better than Localbitcoins. No  high fees, traders release coins faster, I can buy in big volume, and no scammer issue because traders are closely monitored.
They are new though. But with time these guys will be everywhere. At least the only reliable P2P platform I used after Paxful and Localbitcoins

Phones, laptops, aren't good storage options bro. Those can get stolen. Though I agree with ledger if you have up to more btc or more. But most decentralized foreign exchanges and wallet platform like Fatpurchase.com  hardly have issues with USA except Centralized and transacting in USD That's the reason the platform launched FTCOIN as an alternative to store your Bitcoin instead of US dollars. Even Binance with BNB, so they won't get into US government trouble.
That's the reason even Localbitcoin needs to be weary of US residents.
