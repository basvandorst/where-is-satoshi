Information still travels through a cable. This requires more trust than a device that does not have any physical connection to another device. Am I wrong?
For example, you must trust that you aren't using a fake Trezor.

Welcome, welcome to One Minute Crypto! I'm your host, Chronos, and today we're going to talk about something that most people don't usually think about: how much electricity bitcoin mining uses around the entire world. Every now and then, you see a news article about it, but it mostly flies under the radar. So in this video, we're going to look at some estimates, talk about why this is a big deal, and then maybe a reason that it's really nothing to worry about.
So, one of the the biggest reasons to be concerned about the electricity usage of bitcoin mining is the sheer size of the numbers. There's a great website called Digiconomist that puts out some estimates on this, so I've put a link in the video description. At the time of this recording, in early 2018, they estimate the bitcoin network to consume about 38 terawatt hours of electricity per year, which puts it at about the level of the entire country of New Zealand or Peru. If bitcoin were its own country, it would currently be 57th in the list of top electricity consumers. Wow. Probably not great for the environment.
Not only that, but the energy usage chart is pretty much moving in just one direction: up.
So why is this? Well, the bitcoin network is designed to create a certain amount of new bitcoins for every block that's mined on the blockchain. So when the value of bitcoin rises, which it's been doing for a while now, it basically incentivizes this entire crazy system to get bigger and bigger.
Another interesting way to look at this whole problem is: how much electricity is burned in bitcoin mining, per transaction processed on the network? When we do the math, we get an estimate of 330 kilowatt hours per transaction, which is about the same as leaving a bright 100-watt lightbulb on, all day and night, for over four months, for ONE transaction. That definitely seems excessive to me, especially since there are alternative blockchain security models, like Proof of Stake, that don't depend on this kind of consumption.
But let's balance this out with another perspective. Bitcoin is securely processing worldwide, irreversible payments. If we wanted to do this with another technology, we would use, well, BANKS! Think about all the "energy" that banks use. The cost of just running the bank branches, which would include the real estate, the employee time, the electricity for heating the buildings, it all really adds up. I undestand that banks handle a lot more than just global payments, but between the two systems, it seems to me that bitcoin could still the smaller leach on society, if you know what I mean.
But what do you think about all this? Is bitcoin hugely wasteful, or it is completely reasonable, considering what it offers to the community? Let us know in the comments below, and don't forget to subscribe. Thanks for watching!

I disagree. Such a system, under proof-of-work, would not be secure. The value of bitcoin "point hoarding" is why miners invest so much to secure it. A "cats" blockchain would not be mined by enough investment to keep it secure from a malicious attacker who wanted to reverse a transaction.

Must have been nice to be able to send your cryptocurrency to another address on the network in a reasonable amount of time. :(

Hi Greg, big fan of your work on Elements and Confidential Transactions. Thanks for your detailed response to this Segwit video.
I did misspeak in the video by saying that Segwit doesn't help scaling, because as you've pointed out, it does help in several subtle ways. I intended to merely emphasize that Segwit isn't performing actual signature compression.
Our latest work is a 2-minute video which helps clarify what is meant by "scaling" a blockchain. As you know, it's much deeper than merely setting a block size limit. You might enjoy.

Fees are dependent on the other transactions in the mempool.  You're on the right track.
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:54:33
Fees don't affect validation time. They affect transaction priority when blocks are full.
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:15:09
I think the opposite: so many supporters of BIP 101/Bitcoin XT have been banned, I'm amaze there's anyone left on this subreddit to support it. The fact that the debate can carry on is a testament to how many laypeople support it.
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:51:27
That doesn’t seem correct to me. Open and closing channels requires a healthy underlying blockchain.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:45:27
Oops, I made a mistake. I misread the post as something like, "base-layer bitcoin being centralized can not harm a second layer protocol," when it actually meant, "base-layer bitcoin can not become centralized due to the structure of a second layer protocol." My apologies.

Are you sure it would be possible to merge mine on both chains? If so, rational miners would want to mine both chains, to maximize income.
@_date: 2016-03-16 06:10:15
Perhaps not. His OP states, "I cant find the changes needed to be made to support segwit." Perhaps you can point out any misunderstandings.
@_date: 2016-01-24 06:01:12
This is revolutionary. Say goodbye to one of the best arguments against bigger blocks. Inventions like this make me more favorable towards clients like Bitcoin Unlimited, which can scale and re-scale the block size without additional hard forks.

To be more apples-to-apples, we should probably compare BIP 152 low-bandwidth mode, not high-bandwidth mode (since xThinBlocks requires a comparably low amount of bandwidth). I'm curious -- how do the BIP 152 round-trip percentages look in that mode?
@_date: 2018-10-30 04:04:15
Sounds about right.
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:34:54
I made a 59-second video today called "What is Bitcoin." My goal is to confuse you more. Did it work? 
@_date: 2016-11-03 23:56:40
I would find it half-amusing if kept all the free bitcoin for himself at the end.
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:28:35
Based on your link, which talks about non-mining nodes, I think you did not read my post carefully. Sorry, it could have been more clear. I wrote:


I was saying that Accept Depth can be useful for miners. I agree that non-mining nodes don't have much power.
Now, maybe you think that miners will always want the biggest blocks possible, but I'm not sure of that -- we've seen from the network today that they may earn more fees if the same block size restriction is enforced to all miners, which is something BU could help enforce through the Accept Depth mechanism.
@_date: 2016-12-18 23:51:19
Are you sure? Can you share more info on how it would be improved by that? I wasn't aware that fixing malleability would impact Tumblebit.
@_date: 2016-11-06 04:43:50
So I guess this was a scam? The description says:


...and then we see the entire balanced removed from the coin immediately after the contest is over: 
@_date: 2016-12-19 02:37:13
OK, I'll file that away under the "allegedly" section of my brain. I'll start believing it when I run into more evidence that supports it. :)
@_date: 2016-11-09 06:40:46
My apologies for the accusation. Clever contest. :)
@_date: 2016-11-01 15:51:26
As far as I can tell, this article ignores situations where a big-block miner is in the minority, which is the scenario where Accept Depth usefully protects miner consensus to keep blocks smaller against such an attack.
I liked the images in this post more than the logic, haha.
@_date: 2016-12-03 16:43:21
If you want the true thoughts of all, you should probably post this question in a place where they can be given.
@_date: 2016-12-16 18:10:32
No, actually this technology does not require malleability to be fixed.

Here's a recent analysis of segwit that you might enjoy. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 20:45:20
If you truly want to know about any negative implications of segwit, I recommend asking your question in a place where people can answer freely without fear of being banned.
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:14:57
It is not.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:57:36
Good idea. Bitcoin (BTC) keeps things clear without dripping with tribalism.
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:57:20
Ironic, since bitcoin itself suffers from tribalism.
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:40:58
I personally wouldn't use Segwit for that, but some people would. It's a matter of opinion.
@_date: 2016-10-19 03:18:43
Short answers:
HK agreement, you should be able to find the truth with the proper research.
Wallet, yes, the recipient generates the address, so you are correct. An pre-segwit full node wouldn't receive a segwit txn to itself, for that reason. It simply wouldn't be able to validate anyone else's segwit txns.
In terms of central planning, there's a 75% discount for signature data hardcoded into the proposed segwit right now. That's an arbitrary number, hence "central planning" accusation. It could be 50% or 90% or 0% and segwit would still work.
I'm not here to defend or attack segwit. Like I said before, I recommend you post your questions in where there are plenty of rabid segwit attackers who will be happy to talk with you. :-) This sub has been cleansed of many who have opposing views.
@_date: 2016-10-24 21:58:41
Perhaps the problem is that you are mining Bitcoin with a CPU? I can't believe you are even earning 0.1 EUR per day with that. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:39:43
I did it recently, because I was surrounded by fanatics who wouldn't be sure what I meant when I said “Bitcoin.” :P

"In this study, a second round trip was required 1.5% of the time." That seems pretty good. Any idea how it compares to alternative implementations?

Electrum is one of the better places for your bitcoin.

The official statement from the Twitter account of BTC-e says they'll be back in 5 to 10 days. This announcement from the DOJ certainly casts some doubt on the claim.

Does your address start with 1 or 3? If so, you don't have anything. That would be the public address, which doesn't control the bitcoin.

Transcript below.
Welcome, welcome to One Minute Crypto! I'm your host, Chronos, and today I want to talk about what I think gives bitcoin its intrinsic value. First, we should define this, because "intrinsic value" probably means different things to different people. To me, intrinsic value means that the thing is fundamentally useful for something.
For example, bananas have intrinsic value, because they're delicious. But US Dollars, by this definition, do not, because you can't eat them, you can't build anything with them, you can't even light them on fire in a useful way. All you can do is hope somebody else wants them. And if they do, the dollars have extrinsic value.
But how is Bitcoin intrinsically useful? Because it's a highly portable bearer instrument. OK, time for another definition. A bearer instrument is something that is owned by whoever has posession of it. Like cash: if I have this $20 bill, it's mine, and if I give it to you, it's yours. This is much different from money in a bank account, or shares in a company, where ownership is determined by an authority.
But bitcoin is something more than cash, because it's portable. I can't really hand you this money, because you're not in the same room as me. But I can send you bitcoin, anywhere in the world, almost instantly. This combination: something you can own by controlling it, but you can instantly send it anywhere, gives people control over their own money in a fundamentally new way. Never before in the history of the world have we had something with this level of individual empowerment.
And that's why I think bitcoin is valuable.
I'm Chronos. Thanks for watching!
