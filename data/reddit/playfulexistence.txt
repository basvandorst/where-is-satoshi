There are likely a small number of people that are buying up the cheap bitcoins in the hope of being able to withdraw them later. If they are right they will instantly become incredibly rich.
Could be insiders.

If you sold 1 Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash at the first opportunity, you'd have about $10K now.

Competition is good. Without any competition, we'd still be stuck with 1MB blocks even now.

He means mathematically it's impossible because there are only ever going to be 21 million bitcoins. So yes you could buy 1 BTC right now, but not everyone can do that at the same time because if they tried to, the price would approach infinity as the supply runs out. It would literally be impossible for everyone to do it regardless of how much they are willing to pay.

Nobody that ever bought bitcoin is an idiot. Everyone is up.
The idiots are the people that knew bitcoin was going up but didn't buy because they were waiting for the price to drop.

Nope, but they do care about saving face.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:36:55
They would probably be quite happy to let the economy crash right now and let Trump take the blame for it. I suspect they only waited this long because they don't want people to be able to blame it on Obama.

The BTC community has been trying for 3 years to get a block size increase but ultimately failed because it was "too rushed".
It's time to face it: BTC is never going to get a block size increase. The big blockers have already left, and the people that are still here don't WANT a block size increase. It will never happen.
@_date: 2017-04-08 05:45:38

I'm worried that bitcoin might be getting too strong. I think it's partly my fault because I got people interested in it. But that's going to hurt in the long run.

The fee is likely to go down. If you wait a few days for the weekend it should hopefully go below $5.

Or use Paypal to buy it, so you're spamming their network instead of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin cash survived only because it has difficulty adjustment.
This time it won't be 6 hours between blocks, it might be days or even weeks, depending on how many of the miners continue mining the minority chain at a loss.

Thanks for your local perspective.
I'm curious: do you know any good bloggers / vloggers from Korea that write in English and talk about the crypto-scene in Korea but aimed at an international audience, not just Koreans. I'd love to know more of what life is like there for a typical Korean Bitcoiner.

There are several other advantages to hardware wallets, especially if you use multiple alt-coins and want to use multiple deposit addresses per alt-coin, not reusing change addresses, etc.
Paper wallets are good for one thing, hardware wallets good for another. No reason you can't use both, for their different purposes.
@_date: 2017-09-25 08:13:58
The exchange do pay those fees. If Bitcoin tx fees increase they either have to move that cost to the customer by increasing their withdrawal fees (making their service more expensive = less attractive), or else they have to take a hit on their profits.
Whichever path they take, they have an incentive to reduce their fees. The reason why some ecchanges don't do anything is because they also have other business requirements: fast and reliable service, good customer support, advertising, etc... Reducing their transaction fees might not be their number 1 priority right now.

If you have to make a post about it every time you get a low fee, then your coin is broken. Low fees should not be a rare event.

If that's your opinion, why not support a block size decrease?
Why is Satoshi's choice of 1 MB somehow magically the right number? Why would 2.0 MB, 0.8 MB or 1.5 MB not work? If the core devs say that the block size should be reduced to 330 kB are you going to oppose them?

Rent prices in real life is about supply and demand. In Monopoly it is arbitrarily set by the game creators. Though some countries the government tries to dictate what rents must be in certain areas so yeah I guess it's similar in some ways.
