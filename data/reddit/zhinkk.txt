Thanks for the suggestion. He didn't chose the the seed, electrum generated a 12 word seed that is totally random, so he's good. :)

You're not using any kind of shared wallet, are you? The address you sent from should be YOUR OWN individual address, not some shared sending service's address (because coins are sent back to address sent from).

Around a dollar a day (running 24x7), but I made that clear before I bought the miner and he was fine with it.

Haha no worries man, I'm only 16. I'm glad though, I've gotten into the bitcoin scene so early in my life. I love everything about bitcoin, especially the technology behind it. Sure, there's lots of money to be made in these early years of bitcoin, but I love the programming experience I've received. I've coded a faucet by myself (even though there's tons available, I wanted the experience) and I've learned A LOT about how transactions in the network work. I like being 'a part' of bitcoin.

Lol, thanks. Corrected. I was just really excited when posting this, forgot to double check. :)

That's actually pretty nice of him, putting his own resources into emailing everybody to warn them. I wonder if it paid off through the referrals.

What you *could* do is find it on amazon or ebay and use a bitcoin purchase service like bitsumo.com to buy it. I've used bitsumo for my Galaxy S3 and it worked perfectly, and he even handled my return very fast back to the ebay seller. I know some people also use snapcard, so you might want to try that.
The only problem you'll have is that you have to pay some addition fees for the service. Nothing too major though.

Yep, less than a month actually. I have a 7950 card in there which hashes around 600kh/s. Past month I don't know why, but I somtimes received over 0.02BTC a day for mining. Prices were high.
Don't believe me? Here's evidence:
(screenshot of page here: 
I made around 0.246 in less than a month. The rest I paid out of my balance to make up for the $250.

Exactly what started playing in my head when I read the title.

Around $2 for 48 hours where I live (0.11/kWh and 400 watts). I could have been mining though, instead of generating a 1BigDick address, lol.
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:36:18
I can't believe I just bought this... lol
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:21:17
Damn! I knew the vanity gen program you released at  was rigged :(
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:32:44
I asked bitstamp support and they said you DO need to verified just to deposit/withdraw BTC:
Mtgox allowed me to deposit/withdraw BTC without verification even though they said they don't allow it... be careful though
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:57:48
I sent money from and to the 1BigDick address. Shouldn't it work then?
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:31:47
I told my friend about this, he's an artist so he can probably submit an entry. :)

"Investigating a database issue. Will be back shortly."
from their twitter: 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:46:39
Yeah, I just tried sending 1 mBTC to my 1BigDick address and it's not showing up on firstbits.net (or blockchain.info).
I like the idea behind it though!
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:34:21
Lol I'd be willing to sell it if someone trusts me to forgot the private key after I give it to them. :P
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:12:36
If it's just the website, why doesn't blockchain.info not work either? :O
@_date: 2013-09-28 14:02:37
Bitcoin-Qt (I'm assuming this is what you downloaded) has to download all of the blockchain to function. If you don't want to download the whole blockchain, use something like electrum or multibit. It doesn't need to download the whole blockchain and you can have a working wallet in seconds after install:

I hope you mean 0.0005BTC. 0.005BTC is a large fee to pay, about 50 cents atm.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:28:18
Lool I know, just messing. Thanks for fixing the oclvanitygen program for the newer AMD cards though, I wouldn't be able to get my hands on 1BigDick (lol... hands on) without you! :)
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:09:08
I'm too immature. I went on their website and logged in with inappropriate details like "fuckyoufaggotscammers" and password "yousuckdickslosers" JUST so when they check for the accounts people have entered they will see that, haha.
Good catch, though!

It would take a desktop PC about
48 quintillion years
to crack your password
Hmmm hackers need to try the alphabet, could save them 48 quintillion years. (That's not really my password, btw).

You could probably report under the "Abuse" department here:

That's a great idea! And too bad, I'll be uploading pics ASAP.
