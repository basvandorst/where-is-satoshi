lol. ok boomer.
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:17:32
can we be done with the phrase "stacking sats"? It's lame. Why not just accumulation?
@_date: 2019-11-26 20:53:17
Unfortunate, but this is what happens to guinea pigs.

Breaking the cycle of generational disappointment due to changing perspective of the younger generation and their need to take control of their perceived life/destiny would imply that all humans die.

u/goztdog......he stalks the street at night where he was hit by a car so many years ago. If you listen closely you can hear the jingle of his collar/tags and the pitter patter of his little feetz on the pavement. Hi fren, I'm doin the ghozt doggo thing.
@_date: 2019-11-19 13:37:17
ok boomer....you're the psycho who claims that I use Bitfinex and Coinbase for some reason. They are "reputable" in the sense that they won't blatantly steal your money. I'm sure you are just butt hurt since you probably fell for onecoin scams.
Also, since when are BTC fraud coins? You probably shower in Tether bro.
@_date: 2019-11-13 20:07:00
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2019-11-13 19:37:52
Couldn't agree more. This guy actually thinks the current financial system is going to not exist in the next 2 years. It took us 30 years to adopt the debit card.

@_date: 2019-11-22 21:14:14
I agree. They are all stacking sats inside of some messed up echo chamber while doing TA on charts when they don't even know what linear vs log means and they work at home depot.

Stupid answer that's not what he's asking.
@_date: 2019-11-25 11:09:37
I think you were downvoted for negative remarks which is unfair because BTC could fail--people who don't acknowledge this are ass clowns.
I downvoted you because no one cares about your stupid sell story. You should have regrets if you actually sold a lot of bitcoin. You would be a multi millionaire at this point.
@_date: 2019-11-13 13:02:03
it's gonna be huuuuge.
@_date: 2019-11-26 06:48:03
Totally agree. We need to get beyond these stupid lines. Stack sats, buy the dip, etc. It's called accumulating or buying.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:15:10

@_date: 2019-11-22 18:17:22
That makes sense, but  bitcoin as a public distributed ledger isn't stealthy at all. It's actually very non-stealthy since everything is public at this point. Could be made stealthy in the future hopefully!
@_date: 2019-11-27 13:47:44
Good point. That is fair. Have a great day kind sir!

It didn't. I just think this sub has a lot of folks who think the entire system will collapse imminently. A depression I understand, but I wish people would stop talking like it's going to be dawn of the dead and only hodlers will have bunkers and sharp objects. We will certainly be better off, but others will still have sharp objects.

You're getting down voted because  your making a price claim and you're some rando TA guy. Stop making price forecasts. I'm not a moon boy and agree it's likely to slip further down--but enough with the price talk on either side. 3k. 20k. No one knows.

@_date: 2019-12-20 12:44:53
people like you need to disconnect your internet connection and just never speak about bitcoin. Stop with your stupid TA price bullshit you saw on youtube.
@_date: 2019-12-31 12:26:42
It means empty you life savings and buy bitcoin. Take out massive loans. /s
You probably just shouldn't do anything since you cannot even do basic research.

You need to do more research instead of buying 10 euros worth of something.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:12:11
In all seriousness, you can store as many as you like. Think about it.
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:39:31

@_date: 2019-12-19 19:00:41
No offense, but your concept of "full units of bitcoin" makes no sense. Bitcoin is divisible by eight decimal points. 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC. If I buy bitcoin--I could be buying 0.00000001 BTC or I could be buying 10000 BTC. 1 Satoshi is a full unit of bitcoin as you would say friend.
Day traders talk about stacking sats as well, even though they are buying 2+ BTC, so I'm sorry but you are just completely unaware of how things actually exist.
Stacking sats is just a lame catchphrase that's become part of the roller coaster meme culture.
@_date: 2019-12-31 12:28:14
people love their stupid little meme culture phrases now. Stack sats while buying the dip before the halvening. Bout to get reked bruh.
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:55:57
This post is woke AF.
@_date: 2019-12-18 14:56:48
I couldn't agree more. When I see it. I post and tell people that it's annoying. Why not just use the word buy or accumulate--we don't need stupid catch phrases.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:19:23
You should probably not be stacking sats.
