It's a DIY solution but I think some folks on the bitcointalk forum are preparing to build a kit. In the github readme (  ) you can find some links to buy the Rasp PI and the thermal printer. Then it's just a matter of installing everything with some shell commands and you're done!

It doesn't fade, if stored far from direct light (for example in a deposit box or inside a book), otherwise in normal light conditions, good thermal paper it should last for about 5-7 years.
Another problem is that ink can be washed away by water, that's why it's recommended to use a laminator (plastic sheets) to preserve the print from liquids.

makes perfect sense
@_date: 2015-05-20 10:29:51
but the core concept is that a tag should be disposable / one-use-only as a paper wallet is, also we tried to make the simplest thing possible, 2 actions: create and sweep, 2 events: empty and full tag

Nice! Thanks, I'll have a look at it!
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:36:35
That's a good project too!
The merchant could have an NFC terminal (a raspberry pi with usb NFC reader/writer or an android phone) that creates payment requests and as soon as you tap your phone on. So using NFC instead of scanning QR codes. I think I saw something like that already thou. 
Anyway we got an usb NFC reader/writer as well and we're interested to do a simple proof-of-concept using bitcoind and its JSON api in the near future :)
Unfortunately this is not our main job at the moment so we can't work full time on that, even if we would really like it :)

@_date: 2015-05-20 10:18:30
you are right! The fix will be applied in the next release 
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:35:52
I tried Aegis now, It seems very well done! It uses NFC in a different way thou, it uses them as a "password" mechanism to unlock the wallet which is very cool (even if I couldn't try the full features because it needs larger tags, here I have only Mifare 137 bytes tags that are more than ok to store a private key and an url or a BIP38 private key... hmm...) 
We actually use NFC to create wallets (similar to paper-wallets) into the tags themselves, as we generate and store a private key into them, that is different from the key we have in the phone wallet. The two apps are very different one from the other, I think both are good and we think there are many use cases of the NFC protocol and tags as we read from all your reddit posts. We'll try to release more versions/variants of the wallet to try them out, right now BIP38 and tag cloning are on top of the list.
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:38:15
oh really? I didn't know that! thanks for the insight
@_date: 2015-05-22 22:28:25
awesome! do you accept bitcoin? opening hours? thanks
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:02:55
sure, nice API, but as I'm mainly a backend developer, I would prefer to do a multisig key sharing client-server implementation by myself some day
@_date: 2015-05-20 08:49:16
I have a few questions about how this works.
1) where is the private key? Is it written on to the NFC tag or kept on the phone?
2) Is there a way to encrypt the key if it is on the NFC tag?
3) When you brought out the little coins I saw this being used in casinos with smart tables so that you can just through down a load of these and it know exactly how much is there. How do you see these tags being used?
1) The private keys are written to the NFC tags, when you write one, the tag becomes very much like a paper wallet. There is also a wallet on the phone so there's another private key there as well.
2) There are ways to encrypt the key in the nfc wallet with a password both the NFC protocol has one and of course there's BIP38. Unfortunately we didn't make it in time but we will add that feature as soon as the judging ends :)
3) Why not! That's why we posted in We want you to imagine new use cases we didn't think about because we were too much into codes and bits ^^

I think you are missing the point a bit here. 
Creating something small from scratch like a simple wallet with a special feature and testing and building upon that idea it's something different from integrating NFC in an existing codebase of a well estabilished wallet. Also with BitNFC we hope to push other wallet developers to implement NFC in their own wallet solutions! Unfortunately every dev has a different stack, every project has a different target audience, and every team has a different way of doing things :D
Also I like to build things from scratch ^^
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:50:16
YES :D
Bitcoin just become more physical and cash-like !!
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:05:16
We're using Blockchain.info API in the current version (to get the unspent outputs, balance and push the transactions), but we want to use the more APIs as we can possibly do to push the transactions (so coinbase's Toshi, blockr.io, Chain.com, blockcypher, etc...). Also I like the Ruby programming language and even if I don't like Coinbase for the company politics they had (but also I understand those), some of their ruby tech (and open source libraries that they are working and supporting) is pretty cool! We shouldn't ignore that!
@_date: 2015-05-20 09:24:34
But it will be just a standard wallet as Apple didn't made the NFC API public yet. We are using this cordova plugin btw:  - that means that the app should work also on Blackberry and Windows phone theoretically but we didn't test it as we don't have a device of that type.
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:21:54
It sends a transaction to your wallet, and the private key in the tag will be substituted with a new, "fresh" one at the next tap
@_date: 2015-05-20 10:19:56
Yes it sweeps the entire balance right now so it can re-generate a new private key every time you scan the tag, this behaviour might change in the future, remember this is beta software (2 weeks of dev time only) :) !

OP here, this project started because of a personal need:
Explaining Bitcoin to people and driving bitcoin adoption are one of my main concerns at the moment. I want to use bitcoin with the people I know, I would like them to try bitcoin so then they buy some more for themselves, so we can use them instead of cash and transition to a more fluid, sharing based economy (e.g. fan/spread - microtransactions).
I found that when I tell people about bitcoin, and want to give some millibits so they actually can try the experience of using a wallet, the first step is always to ask them to install a wallet app, so I can send some millibits to them.
What I found is that they usually don't want to do it straight away (especially if I just met them), or there are connection issues etc etc.. also, it feels that the first experience they have with it is too digital, it all seems a bit "virtual" to them, they don't understand well what a private key is and other core bitcoin concepts.
I have a 3D printer (cheap RepRap one), so I decided 3D print some bitcoin "coins" and I stuck an NFC tag on each of the coins.
I first ask which phone they have (iphone/android); if they have and android phone with NFC I hand over the tag to them and tell them to try to scan it. They don't have to do it right now but as the tag is pretty (and strong) they'll not throw it away, break it they (or somebody else eventually) will do it (paper wallets are a bit fragile - I used to print those with  but NFC tags are better).
In the NFC tag I usually used to put an url in the tag pointing to this guide I made on how to spend them: 
But the process was very long (especially for me, the load process was way too complex) - This is the main video of how I used to load/spend the tags using Mycelium:  uuh!
The tags I'm using cost half a dollar each (  ) and to 3D print the enclosure the cost for the plastic is about 20 cents.
I load the tags with 5 or 10 millibits and always carry few of them with me so I can hand them over.
I think adoption is critical, also that as NFC 3D printed bitcoin tags can be used as "notes", in the real world, for a newcomer, the impact that this Bitcoin is a real thing and not another "cool" hipster thing / app to download and soon forget.
Bitcoin is revolution. Not many people know Bitcoin at the moment, even if there's investment, even if there's (mostly bad) news. They don't trust bitcoin until they tried it and understood it, and the only way is for us to spread the word!
sorry, got too excited: TL:DR; I needed this app for myself :D

with BitPay's Bitcore javascript library and various blockchain JSON API (blockchain.info and others) it is really easy and fun to make a bitcoin wallet nowadays 
our implementation is ~300 lines of js, it's basic but it does the job 
@_date: 2015-05-20 11:28:27
After the judgement period and if no majour bugs are there we will publish to the play store
In the mean time who wants to help can beta test it and give us feedback!
If somebody wants some millibits to test the app just send me a screenshot of the app and I'll send some.
@_date: 2015-11-12 06:54:15
I see, very interesting, thanks for the info!  I'll try counterparty-lib soon! 
@_date: 2015-11-11 08:11:01


That's another idea, I wanted to make a fast way of doing this, so every time you need to post something important, you go to blockchainpen.com and it's all ready, you just need to setup once and then you don't need an external wallet anymore - but yes, hey! I could have done a BIP70 version, that's even simpler :)
If you want a BIP70 version you can check eternitywall's Android app that does exactly that but always adds EW as prefix, here's the link: (  )
@_date: 2015-11-11 08:29:49
There's a link to add EW in the options, I just didn't want to make it eternitywall specific so if somebody wants to create a similar service with another prefix I have a generic app that can write to it as well
@_date: 2015-11-11 14:25:54
I did the fix, you should have a somewhat comprehensible error message now. thank you again! 
@_date: 2015-11-11 14:28:12
do you have an address where I can tip you some millibits? 
@_date: 2015-11-12 21:52:25
should be fixed now, thanks for reporting
@_date: 2015-11-11 14:14:59
I think it's because there are no available unspent output to sign the next transaction, you have to wait for the next block to be mined or send at least 0.11 millibits to have a spendable output, I have to provide a friendly error message to the user, I will fix it today and ping you,  thanks for reporting! 
@_date: 2015-11-11 08:05:24
I've sent you 3 millibits to the address, you should be able to write ~30 messages :) enjoy!
@_date: 2015-11-11 01:35:02
it uses a clientside wallet that writes to the blockchain using OP_RETURN 
use it for important messages or other datas you need to prove its existance / timestamp 
the code is open source, if you want to send a lot of messages, use testnet by adding this to the code: 
bitcore.Networks.defaultNetwork = bitcore.Networks.testnet;
CODE: 
run it locally: 
- download zip 
- run: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 
- open

I don't know the exact response for this answer but I could try, but first I would like to hear somebody else, does someone know about how pruning selects the tx to prune?
@_date: 2015-11-11 14:10:16
Cool! Is there a public block explorer already "reading" those messages? Do they get stored only in the counterparty "patched" nodes? I thought about writing slightly bigger messages like 200 chars by using 3 op_return outputs linked but also there's no block explorer even reading those. Thanks for the suggestion btw, maybe someone can fork and do it? 
@_date: 2015-11-11 01:32:13
add EW at the beginning of the message, they will be posted on
