That's what your missing. The competitors aren't following them, they are the ones who are late to the show. I have been using BTC transactions exclusively for over a year on 6 different sites and so have any serious sportsbettors I know who have any knowledge on BTC. This will have a positive effect, just a small one. Like I said, Sportsbook is a terrible site with a terrible reputation who has a great URL and a top notch advertising department but any bettor who does anything more than the occasional 20$ bet already has accts at superior sites who accept BTC.

fwiw, i have done withdrawn several times from Online sportsbooks to coinbase (5dimes, skybook and heritage) with no issues. Even if coinbase were to eliminate sportsbook cashouts, there are plenty of other options to cashout.

This is not really groundbreaking news. There are several sites that have been accepting bitcoin for a while now (5dimes, skybook, heritage, GTbets, just to name a few). I have done several bitcoin transactions without any issues. It is incredibly convenient. Im assuming the only reason this is upvoted is due to Sportsbook shills doing so. Sportsbook.ag is a garbage site with a horrible reputation and great advertising department. For a recreational player, check out 5dimes or if you're into higher limits, give bookmaker a look.

I think you greatly overestimate the risk involved. The fluctuations in bitcoin are not all that relevant in this case. Your sportsbook account is measurede in dollars in most cases, not bitcoin so when you deposit, you just get the exchange rate and likewise when you withdraw.
