I feel like gamers have the edge in bitcoin specifically. It plays to the need for repetitive tasks to win at something and the ability to sit there for hours poopsocking 11k ;)

use the force man!

Even the math above is ambiguous. Thats if you are still trading 1 btc. In reality because you sold that 1btc and bought more at 10, you are able to buy more btc than 1. This profit is exponential growth..kind of like dividend reinvestment on a larger scale. Again in a perfect scenario.

Yes if the fees were a lot less or free. imo if im paying cash there is no fee. if i pay card there is, so its like a really expensive credit card transaction...more like a wire transfer to pay for something which is garbage. That said, there's a premium for anonymity (useless for me but hey whatever). If the perfect conditions existed and it reached equalibrium, imho it would reach it at a much higher price (like 100k or something). Only because of the fact that if every millionaire wanted one, they couldn't get one. I sold a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle for 1200 bucks for the same reason. At that point though, like usd/euro it would only be worth it to investors at really high dollar amounts bc the fluctuation would be very small. That is looking at it as a complete currency, which it's really not. More like using gold as currency and a store of value. At that point, I think it would still be a good investment. I REALLY want to use btc to buy a house. It's an interesting situation bc its considered property by "you know who". If I traded property that was worth 100k for another that's worth 100k or 500k, if you live there for 3 out of 5 years, you do not have to pay tax on the sale of the house.

The term youre looking for is poopsocking.

Yah, that 230am est crowd are a wily bunch tho
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:33:33
so when you say that, does that mean that it dropped far and should drop farther or again, but it bounced bc it dropped a fairly large distance?
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:46:14
Damn it Nancy.

Gdax is very good. Its owned by coinbase. Much cheaper to free if u limit buy and sell. Coinbase is for noobs. Easy. Kraken is another decent one but usability kind of difficult. Yobit and binance trade more coins but i dont like them as much as gdax. I use a few exchanges tho. If you have to withdraw or deposit a lot of usd at once its a bit easier to piece it out between exchanges
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:56:33
Not sure why that's illegal tho. Maybe it's the gamer in me, but I'm sure people look at those and say...we can take that down heh.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:24:57
Sounds familiar heh
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:32:21
R u saying that bc theres red next to the top of the bband?
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:32:40
Ur math is wonkey. If u buy at 9 and sell at 11, thats 2k profit. If u buy back at 10k and sell at 12 thats a total of 4k profit. Buying at 9 and selling at 12 is only 3k profit. So you benefit from trading lime that if u can time it well. Thats where most people lose is trying to time markets. Not always losing principal but economic loss of doing something when nothing was done or visa versa. Thats where dollar cost avg trading is beneficial. That might not get you 3k however. If perfect conditions arise you can get 3 or 4k based on your style. However in RL theres risk. Avg costing removes some of that risk.

The only reason it's not going above 8 is i havent sold my hodl position. as soon as i do itll go up. One could be convinced to be compensated for doing so. Any takers? ;)

Hong Kong is still China, much lime Macau is. It's a special admin region. Not part of mainland China but still owned by China. Transferred in like 99. Anyway, since its autonomous, they enjoy lots more freedom than mainland but are still controlled in a completely totalitarian way. Even if its acted upon much less. They also have Autonomous regions like Taiwan and Tibet and a few others that are still China (unfortunately), but keep their original names and still controlled heavily.

They have a HUGE problem with counterfit money. Centralized crypto would be better than what they have. They domt have their stuff together enough to pull off using that instead of yeun tho imo
