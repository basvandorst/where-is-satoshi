Yes I do, but as I type this -qt seems to have got past the 'bottle neck' at 3-4 years of blockchain. It's into 2 years 36 weeks to go and that's with starting -qt with -salvagewallet. Will reply with update

I've just reinstalled on another machine with 300GB drive, still crashes around 3-4 years back....
Must be wallet related?

So after about 3 weeks of downloading this problem is solved (I have 2mbit internet connection so probably a lot faster to download 80gb for others) and I can complete transactions with my wallet.
My solution was:
Back up wallet
Completely delete the blockchain from the machine 
Start QT with -salvagewallet
Wait for the entire chain to download

I will run a memtest but I think its all okay - especially as this is now happening on two machines.
Crashed AGAIN on the other machine (3.5 years back - did do a few transactions back then if that of any relevance)
















Not a promising read above... Have started again with -salvagewallet
I'm also torrenting the blockchain and will try and 'feed' that to -QT and see if it helps?
