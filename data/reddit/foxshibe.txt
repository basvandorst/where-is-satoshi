Actually, Reddcoin was banned because they did it too aggressively to a particularly absurd degree. There is a "Reddcoin Tipping Army" subreddit which has a tendency to flat-out spam comments with tips. Tipping Reddcoin isn't bad. But when you're doing it in such a poor way it becomes unsightly. We've actually talked about this within our own community and are trying to weed out such behavior within our own ranks.
In any case, look at how you're trying to say: Bitcoin is the only coin which deserves live and grow. You're feeling the onset of a culture panic. Bitcoin culture has influenced the cryptocurrency sphere greatly. Now another culture has popped up and you're afraid of what it means for you and the band of bitcoiners you exist with. The fact of the matter is that this cultural matter will resolve itself if we just try and make things work by accepting each other. Bitcoiners can enjoy Dogecoin culture or at least accept it and shibes can do the same with Bitcoin culture (in fact, we already do to a great extent, having borrowed several of your motifs).
Long story short: if Bitcoin wants to coexist with Dogecoin then that will happen. If Bitcoin wants to fight Dogecoin then that will happen. You don't need to do the latter to assure the survival of Bitcoin. This sort of stuff is the same sort of issue which sparks cultural issues all the time in the real world. Don't try and kill off Dogecoin to preserve Bitcoin. The success of the shibes at being an inviting and open community isn't a good reason to be anti-Dogecoin.

I think this subreddit has had a cleanup in terms of tryhards lately. There was a point where people were unwilling to help others trying to get into the ecosystem. Shibes were very willing to help with Dogecoin to help make Dogecoin work. This place has since gotten better and it seems more people are willing to help out newbies. The implication used to be very valid but is now weakening greatly.

I'm fairly sure you would be wasting your time. The shibes on are probably fanatical enough to keep mining coins even if the value got down to 1 liteoshi.

I was trying not to mention DOGE beyond a brief mention but it seems to be taken as a major point of discussion for some reason. So...
I just plainly disagree. A large amount of dogecoin users at least looked at bitcoin first and just weren't interested or weren't helped into the community. It's a huge public outreach issue you guys are ignoring. Don't put the blame on DOGE for actually helping people get into crypto of some sort.
The talk about dogecoin's value wasn't really invited but I wouldn't mind terribly if it weren't for the fact that the majority of the replies are saying "dogecoin is going to fail". **I get that you guys aren't into DOGE.** DOGE is quickly getting about as un-Bitcoin as possible. So obviously a lot of people here don't believe in DOGE's ideology. I get it.
The story about the rise and fall in value was interesting though.

I disagree but that's fine. ~~As for forcing one currency or another, I do not wish to do either, nor do I understand where I gave that impression~~ Nevermind, I get it. Yeah I was just being emphatic with that. This isn't a matter of me forcing anyone to do anything. Also as I was trying to explain I only support inflation to keep the value of money at a set amount instead of raising as a populace grows. That is all.

I will agree to an extent. The esports stuff is cool but absolutely try and break out into the mainstream stuff, too. There's no reason why you guys can't. Bitcoin is way more influential than Dogecoin is. Marketing does matter, or else our dog-based coin wouldn't have gotten this far. DOGE is honestly a lot more style over substance but obviously style is important to people. I hope that Dogecoin will teach Bitcoin about style in the same way that I hope that our community looks towards Bitcoin for substance.

It depends on the economic and political climate, really, and making a broad statement on this sort of thing is pretty difficult. There's no proof that exchanges are more trustworthy than the government and considering the Gox case this shouldn't be glossed over so quickly. With the correct kind of oversight and regulations, Gox probably wouldn't have happened. I don't think the sort of people who frequent this subreddit are going to like this statement but I'm going to assert it anyway.
Saying that only good companies will exist if people only take their service to good companies is a decent assumption but just isn't always true. It's just optimism.
Basically, when the ~~exchanges~~ any industry is kicking your rear, you need to look towards the government. When the government starts regulating too hard you need to wrest power back to the industry. One side isn't definitively better than the other.

That would be true if the shibes were fighting Bitcoin's for dominance of the markets that Bitcoin is trying to get into. As it stands though we aren't trying to do this. We're focusing on finding our own little niches to exist in and then expand outwards from there.
We're all about Blue Ocean Strategy. Plus there are just enough features/differences (inflation, fast transactions, fast distribution although not too fast) which keep us set apart from Bitcoin for those who look closer. Of course, whether they are good or not in the grand scheme of things is something which can be argued for or against. Obviously you should know our stance on the matter.

Hmm, the Dogecoin car got you interested in Bitcoin? How interesting. Anyway...
Bitcoin isn't an investment necessarily. It's money. The more people who treat it like money, the better. Otherwise it turns into a speculatory good, essentially. It's like with gold. The more people sit on it then the more people are saying "let's make the price go up". Inevitably this will cause a bubble which will pop.
Bitcoin's primary endgame and the primary endgame of every altcoin is to be a world-wide economy. Essentially a nationless currency, like gold. This would be good because we would have a worldwide currency which could be sent anywhere on the world very quickly and with nearly no fees attached (well under 1%). It would essentially be stateless cash in just about every way conceivable. This is a really awesome idea. If you are thinking of 'investing' you are probably not here for the right reason. Buying Bitcoin to sit on is how bubbles are started. Bubbles which will diminish interest in Bitcoin as a currency if they do not stop at some point. The best reason to get into cryptocurrency is that you realize the potential for how much good digital cash can bring to the world. Buy and sit on -some- to reap the benefits if and when the price goes up but make sure to spend and circulate to keep the Bitcoin dream alive.
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:58:27
This wasn't supposed to be a DOGE discussion, but fine.
DOGE is an experiment in seeing how successful the shibes can be in creating a successful currency. Just as a matter of clarification, the 5% inflation figure is a slight misquote. 5 billion DOGE/year will be injected into the economy. Thus the percentage will be lower and lower each year. Our soft-cap before this starts to happen will leave us with 100 billion DOGE.
Deflation is a sure way for a currency to gain value but is not a sure way to gain a base of users.


That's intentional. DOGE for all. It's only limited by demand much more than supply. Hopefully we'll keep a decently steady value when people aren't buying and we'll go up when people do buy. That's it. That's our idea of what a currency should be about. We *want* to be all-inclusive unlike Bitcoin. We're willing to pull in more blood to a greater extent than Bitcoin is. A lot of the reason DOGE is doing well is extremely positive public outreach.


Because you guys aren't inviting enough. Look at the downvote brigade. Look at the people among you that say that bitcoin isn't for mainstream users. You are *exclusionary*. Get your product out to market and pull in *everyone* between 20 and 50 who has an inkling of how to use a computer, starting now. And get teens interested. Actually promote yourselves **to the public** instead of only companies. This is what DOGE is doing. You're completely ignoring one side of the issue. You guys need to start acting like a community and promoting yourselves like a community or you'll never reach your full potential as a currency. You don't have to hand out Bitcoins by the fistful to get people excited.
That said, from a purely technological and economic standpoint there's nothing 'wrong' with DOGE aside from Bitcoiners disagreeing about the production model. It may, potentially, end up being faulty but it's certainly not a scam and people are always invited in with open arms.

A lot of altcoins exist without thinking of their future but are obsessed with being viable. Dogecoin wants to be viable... but honestly we are just interested in just having a neat community and a decently stable Dogecoin value. We're not interested in getting rich... necessarily. For most altcoin users... it's heresy to say that. And yet it's a critical step for creating a currency: being loyal to a coin. Many coins aren't built for long-term sustainability and less have communities that would accept the coin still even if it was close to collapse. That's what has kept BTC, LTC, and DOGE so high in marketcap for so long.

Not to be rude but the r/dogecoin community had raised several tens of millions of dogecoins in charity drives, with most tips ranging from the tens of thousands down to 5 doge offerings. Everyone gives what they can and truly believes their contribution means -something- which is why sometimes they can raise so much with so little. Microtipping can add up.
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:31:23
To be honest, I still believe in the whole matter of BTC being overvalued. While it is undoubtedly a nice system I just don't believe in the sort of deflation that the economy is going to see and is already seeing. It's a trend that's going to continue and it will eventually see consequences as time goes on.
While dogecoin is, admittedly, rather ridiculous I love the community and despite rather random parameters being chosen for the distribution of coins I think they ended up being pretty acceptable. I thank the bitcoin community in general for blazing the way and wish them the best of luck but I just don't believe in it, frankly.
Lastly, while I don't mean to be rude I'm pretty sure the bitcoin community's FUD is at least having some effect in dragging DOGE down. Don't be too harsh in your assessment at least at this time until you get your house in order.
