Meanwhile crypto enthusiasts give not one fucking shit. These countries couldn't even agree on the time let alone a global policy on how to ban crypto. Fuck you.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:03:18
I can see Australia as being the first country you go 100% crypto. It will happen at some point and one country has to be the first. I think it will be Australia. You can pay for beer in a bar with Bitcoin in Australia.

thanks for posting this interesting chart.
I googled it but didnt really understand the significance of the current bollinger bands, is it good or bad?
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:19:48
Haha yes I have lots of ideas about that but if I told you then that would break the first rule. You'll just need to use your own creativity on that!
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:46:45
slick, had a similar idea myself so people could read it in the toilet, but never actioned it like you do, nice work

What about the motherfuckers who stole all the nicehash money? Nothing about them being caught that I've seen....

Sounds like typical media drivel always looking for the downside and trying to over dramatise things and promote the negative.
Here's an idea, why not list the top ten ways blockchain can change the fucking world instead?
Here a few ideas right off the top of my head
1. Hospitals and health care
2. Global Identity blockchain
3. Land registry
4. Car ownership
5. Community security
6. Insert your idea here and help change the world for the better instead of trying to promote doom and gloom

Oh yeah, we're experimenting with that now but area stuck trying to get it to unlock crypto section. We tried signing up 3 referrals instead of paying but it not working, should just make the payment for the pro version I guess. You recommend then?
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:11:18
OK then I guess I'll take it. First Satoshi I bought at £840 so I won't really complain :-)

Here is the Wikipedia page for the national debt clock if you are not familiar.
For the uninitiated you could have it show something like this which will also help to clear up the common misconception that you have to buy a whole Bitcoin

No sorry bro' I must have fudge fingers that. Was trying to reply to the guy who said this is why he doesn't come here anymore! Haha
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:00:45
First of all you have to send small amount to verify 7euro I think. I sent 50 because my bank (TSB in UK) charged me 15GBP . They never verified my account but the money arrived in a few days. I bought BTC with it on GDAX in the end.
On the subject of tickets on coinbase I opened one on November 15th about problems we were having trying to program automated trading via their API. I received a reply 26th Jan.

Thanks for the article. How do you see USDT fitting into the equation?
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:28:42
And this is what worries me about it. Tether is like counterfeit money then surely? Until an auditor we approve of says they really do have that money in their account then everything is to fuck surely?
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:55:27

Yes your bitcoin price was locked in when you bought it, and those bitcoins are in your wallet on coinbase.

Small and understated like the president's lapel pin.
Please make something with "HODL to 100k" on the front and "(...then sell to 64!") On the back

Well now we can all watch it and decide for ourselves. I often enjoy movies that other people don't, and Vice Versa. This comment didn't really relate to the announcement though which is that the film makers themselves shared it, which is a brilliant idea and puts their money where their mouth is, so to speak. I hope it works out for them and encourages more of the same. Probably it wont though as a lot of people just take take take, but that is the world we have created and are trying to change. Good on them, I'm looking forward to watching it this afternoon
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:30:10
"HODL to 100k" we know it's coming. (Even if it's followed by "Sell to 64"!) Ack: Clif High
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:39:34
What if Satoshi is wall Street invented this thing to make us think we're freeing ourselves from fiat slavery whilst all along they're just planning to fuck us all by using made up digital dollars (USDT) to manipulate the markets whilst were all evangalising about crypto and thinking conspiracy theories about futures. Throw in a few alien stories for good measure and you have the ultimate sleight of hand...had crossed my mind
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:28:33
Yeah like an FAQ but this info is all available in Google but these people won't look for it. I guess it's down to us to help these people 1 conversation at a time....

I think you can buy guns with Bitcoin right, or a 3d printer and make your own I was reading!
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:48:15
Why don't they use coinmarketcap?
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:37:38
Does it really matter though? As long as there is a CryptoCurrency that someone is happy to use, instead of fiat, then that's a win for us all in the long run simply because it is not fiat surely?
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:16:41
If only 2eur that probs why it not worked. My bank still not verified, but it shows up, can't be arsed with them. I used coinfloor in the end. Checking out Revolut at the moment, guy on here says it cheap

Yeah according to the predictions when payrol goes crypto is the start of the end of the fiat. I'm always trying to think of ways to earn crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:32:45
I couldn't install it because I had to login so will have to give it another go sometime. I always wanted an app to track my mining power value on Hashnest or similar, so maybe you could find a way to add their API too? Would make it unique I think...

Top tip cool thanks will try it. Do you get charged for sending EUR from NatWest though?
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:07:15
Best way to get your btc out of coinbase to fiat if you live in UK is transfer from coinbase to gdax for free(Google it, dead easy) then send btc to coinfloor.co.uk and sell to GBP and withdraw to your GBP bank account. This is the single cheapest way I have found, correct me if you know cheaper.
That said just HODL 
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:56:09
Can't even remember, about 2 years ago it was suddenly just 'there' and I was on it. Oh and then I discovered various dark matter on the dark webs, of course :-)
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:08:44
coinfloor.co.uk check it out, you don't need  for that
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:51:17
This is what I am reading from it too. If the article is accurate you will  notice it says Bitcoin AND Bitcoin Futures. I think we have determined the biggest problem with futures is the misunderstanding and fud and week hands it illicits (apparently that is not a real word) but all these professional traders having a Bitcoin interface that they are allowed to use(?) as of March 2018 is surely going to mean a HUGE influx of trades, I mean really huge. That ought to make the Bitcoin price rocket, surely?
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:15:20
Yeah because they're doing really well catching who stole the nicehash 67musd so they've put that to one side to come and bust you for buying a bag of weed
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:54:30
Yes I think we are seeing that the worry of Bitcoin Futures affecting prices is to be added to the popular misconceptions list along with "Nobody can afford to buy a Bitcoin at $nnnnn each". Is there such a list maintained anywhere?
EDIT: Just stumbled across this  How does it get updated?
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:45:09
Yes Bob my brother I am with you, if we can just free ourselves from Fiat slavery then we will all turn our minds to solving problems of a higher order when we are no longer having to use all of our creativity to just find ways for survival

@_date: 2018-02-02 03:14:10
Absa-fucking-loutly! This is my favourite part, when people realise this, that they can actually do what the fuck they like with their own fucking money and fuck their government or state or whatever, this is when the rest of the people will see the true value of crypto. Fuck anyone who tries to control others, are we not meant to be free, to make our own decisions?
Just get a VPN up, do what you want to do, and fuck anyone who tells you that you can't.
