Uh, I didn’t say that. I asked about the semantics of “backed” in this specific context.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:54:21
Okay so it’s a stable circulated currency. The stability is backed by our military. I guess I hate the transition people always do from “it’s not backed by anything” (there’s no gold in Fort Knox waiting to be exchanged for USD) vs “it’s backed by the military” (meaning stability of country and government using it). Those are both legitimate, but different meanings of the word “backed”.

It’s a blurred line. Is it a loan when you go to the doctor’s office and pay your bill in the mail 3 weeks later?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:37:19
That’s a lot to sign a petition. It’s not like it’s a popular vote.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:52:48


I never understand what being backed my the military means in this context. Someone please explain.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:41:20
It’s not a loan. It’s how are credit cards work. You pay for your credit card purchases 30-60 days after you buy them. It becomes a very expensive loan if you don’t pay your full bill.

Let’s say you own 1,000 bitcoin. Let’s say you exchange 40 bitcoin for a lambo. Now, let’s say you put a vanity plate on your lambo that says 40 BTC. Do you see where I’m going?

All the cake comparisons? There was one. And the fact that the decimal points are limited is still missing the point. If there were infinite decimal points available, there would still be a limited number of Bitcoins, 21 million.

Best way to figure things out is to buy a tiny bit! I'm not advising you be fiscally irresponsible, but buy $10 (or whatever is nothing to you) and pay the fee. It doesn't make sense financially, but it does from an educational point of view.

Look, there is nothing wrong with a dissenting opinion, but there is no denying there is a concerted effort by paid trolls to FUD bitcoin in this sub. It's as obvious as day, and the Occam's razor here has shifted that users who spend all day posting anti bitcoin shit are either paid trolls or free-lance FUDDers shilling for the bitcoin cash cause.
It was obvious in what was happening, and it's obvious here.

@_date: 2017-12-24 04:45:42
Right, I’m saying this person likely did clear that much so it’s not dumb for them to get a lambo. We’re you trying to say something else? It seemed like you were replying to the post saying it was dumb of them to buy a lambo if they only owned 40 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:47:50
It was a joke about your accidental double entendre, no worries kid, I agree.
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:19:09
I mean, if you’re making a specific claim ($1k price) can you please provide a semblance of how you arrived at that figure? I see your reason you think it will drop, but I don’t understand why your drop results in $1k.
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:21:01
Shit’s expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:13:35
It's not what you think. They suspended it because bitcoin cash had an increase in the hours approaching the drop on coinbase, not because coinbase management were insider trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:23:58
I’ll give this a go
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:22:56
^this. Everyone’s moving to doge. Up 350% this month, faster transaction times, built on a meme.

I guess quantity over quality eh?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:33:15
You mean buying while it’s at $20k? Or did you think you had to buy a whole bitcoin at a time? Because you can buy a tiny bit of one bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-06 11:17:27
That’s a bunch of snake oil.

The master of fiscal responsibility cut taxes for the rich and didn’t cut spending, and therefore wildly increased our federal deficit and debt, then was spineless towards anything Trump did that he didn’t agree with, and then he tucked tail and quit.

If you wrote like 5,283 bitcoin sure, but otherwise ehh.

While true, that explanation would probably make most people more confused and have more questions rather than answering their main question.
@_date: 2019-02-06 11:56:18
I mean, from my shallow understanding, it can allow your cold wallet to act like a savings account with minimal transactions and the lightning account would act like your checking account where all the action happens but you don’t have an overwhelming amount of money. So from the amount of transactions it’s like banking, but your “savings account” is in your possession. What’s wrong with that setup?
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:08:26
It was a 6% increase in an hour.

I didn't drop in your thread and harass you, your threads keep popping up on the bitcoin sub. I won't even criticize you for your wrong calls. I will criticize you for constantly making posts that provide no context for your predictions and are hysterical in tone and nature, and then you commenting on your comments. 
Also, way to say I drop in on your threads, and then you drop in on my thread from days ago.
