you might be able to mine 40BTC this month, but when the difficulty almost doubles by next month your device will only be able to mine 20BTC. Your BTC mined per month will roughly be cut in half every single month.

If unicode was used, then you just need to guess a character space and slowly eliminate possibilities. Setting your program to try out all 95000 characters would be impossible.

How do we know you have even purchased these miners? I dont see any kind of proof listed on the website... 
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:08:11
appropriate security measures dont really exist. A system is always vulnerable somehow and someway. If they had 51% of the hashing power they would be a HUGE target and would therefore be under attack constantly by hackers trying to take over the network. 
This is not a good thing. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:23:30
It looks like either the hardware, or the tool people are using has gotten better to. Last time they ran this, people were getting  7 guesses a second, while some in this thread are getting 50+ guesses per sec.

Just to keep it a mystery and require people to build and learn how to make a tool to figure it out for themselves. It doesnt matter either way but since it more for a learning experience its fun to keep it a mystery. 
Thanks for throwing a little into the pot. It would be very cool if people kept "paying it forward" so to speak and once they figure out how to get the small amount of btc out, they will then put some back in for the next person to figure it out. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:22:14
For those without a super beefy computer but want to give this a shot and use this as a learning experience I have created a much simpler bip38 encrypted wallet that you can try to crack. 
This wallet actually has only 4 digits, as in generic numbers. 
The encrypted private address is: 6PfLk3DLTTXwrK6T8PJuLDtRek2WNmdPCd4ht6ShBJ823MBXVqC4a9VEew
Create your own tool or compile one that has already been coded and see if you can figure out what the public address is! You can go to this site to try out what you believe the password is to see if its correct: 
[EDIT] Someone else besides cscott figured out the password, pulled the money, and has hasnt put it back again. People are that greedy and are willing to ruin the fun for just a couple of bucks? lame...  
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:12:50
Not that great of news if you think about. If Cex.io is just redirecting people to other pools, they can just redirect them to a single pool once they have enough users, and can still very easily perform a 51% attack. 
They havent stopped the problem at all, and are still letting new people, and new mining hardware, join their pool...

People in this thread are getting 50+ tries per second on their computers. If you can reliably narrow down the character set you should be able to solve it in days and/or months. I'd be happy have my computer crunch some numbers for a month to make almost 1BTC.

Check out the original thread for program and code that some people developed to try out passwords. Once you have a program working, the trick at that point is to guess the character space. If it is indeed unicode, there are too many characters to try all at once, so you need to guess a smaller character set and try out that. From the original thread, there were a couple people that were really tackling the contest and were able to eliminate quite a few possibilities. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:45:12
Regardless of what character set it is, if he told us the exact page/characters to use, it would completely defeat the point of the contest, and he would be giving it away.

This is an encrypted private key, meaning you need to decrypt it first, with the password, before you can access the private key. The OP in this post has created a wallet, that now has .6BTC+ in it, with the idea being that anyone that is able to brute force crack/hack the encrypted private key, can keep the BTC inside of it. 
Its a carrot to promote and/or see how strong BIP0038 encryption is. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:07:48
"Only" 7,311,616 possibilities for that first password. Even with my fast CPU I can only guess 8 passwords per second. This is going to take a very long time!
At 8 guesses per second it will take over 10 days, assuming you are running it 24/7 for that long. 
[EDIT] looks like the first easy password was guessed, no way it was brute forced in that time.  For the second password there are "only" 380,204,032 possibilities. So only 550.06 days to go brute forcing this on my machine :(
Adding one additional character has added 540 days to the cracking time, pretty crazy to think about. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:48:14
It wasnt done by me, but it looks like the first password may have already been found: 
Im not seeing any posts on who solved it, or what the password was though. 
Confirmed that the answer was: 'BarT' for the first password
@_date: 2015-04-06 20:08:23
looks like the answer was: BarT
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:41:14
well I was basically "cheating" since OP posted the answer so I knew the character set. So since my character set was only: ฿1.23♥, or 10,000 possibilities, it took about 10 minutes on my 2010 mac pro. 
My mac can crunch 8 passwords a second. 
Using the full characterset that OP mentioned had 3 of the 4 characters, plus adding the heart character, that ups the possibilities to: 
Using character set: ♥BɃᗸB⃫Ⓑⓑᴃⓢ0123456789.!    
Password length: 4    
Total keyspace size: 2560000 &lt;-this would have taken a lot longer than 10 minutes ;)
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:47:36
Im sure he used a program to crack it. The key to those programs is giving it a limited character set. I'd be curious to know exactly what character set used.

@_date: 2013-11-13 19:09:20
it isnt profitable. Using their own calculator on their own site, it will show you that it wont be profitable. 
If you bought 3gh/s of hashing power from them, that would cost you .27btc for example. But 3gh of power will only net you .25btc.  
Apparently you can sell back your hashing power, but I dont see how or why they would let you do that.

bingo! None of the miners currently out will ever make a ROI, let alone be profitable. This chart is estimating the increase in difficulty month to month, but over a 100% increase, per month, is what we have been seeing so far.

that 2TH unit for 6k wont ever make ROI either. March is a very long time from now and the difficulty will be insane by the time the miner ever shows up at your door.

AsicMiner cant afford to prepurchase 1000+ devices to then sell then individually. They have always been sold in groups of 1000 as that is the minimum from their supplier as far as I know.
The best way to get just a few of them is to join a group buy and pool your money with others. Or you can wait until other companies prepurchase 1000 of them and then resell them for more money.

recover your losses by gambling on some random new site? Thats some great solid advice you got there... 
So if I have a lot of credit card and mortgage payment debt, should I go to a casino and gamble all of my money to "Recover my losses"?

Litecoin has been specifically made to basically not be compatible with either ASIC or FPGA devices. These FPGA boards absolutely would not work well for litecoin mining. 
Where is the logic in not selling a working product that they have? Why cant them sell these fpga arrays while continuing to work on the asic devices? And while they are selling these, they gain credibility as a reputable company that actually comes out with products in a reasonable time; unlike many other companies out there.

scrypt mining uses little-to-no ddr3 "Desktop" type ram. cgminer on my machine mining litecoin is using 30MB of memory. Its all done in the GPU's very fast, low-level memory.
FPGA's dont have this as far as I know, or it would be really expensive to give them this type of memory.
I hadnt heard of using ddr3 instead of the faster low level memory. ddr3 may work but its going to perform 10x slower then the memory running on modern gpus.  
Litecoin is measured in kh/sec btw, not mh/sec. If they can make an fpga that can do 500mh/sec that would be a complete game changer.

holy crap I cant believe there are actually 19k+ bids on those Jupiters! That is just unreal. There are some foolish rich people out there.... Or a bunch of fools pooling their money together.

the same way the USD, or the euro is "legitimate" currency. Why do you think that bitcoin is not legitimate currency?

Your best bet would be to call the bank you are interested in and ask them directly. 
Lots of fear mongering and accusations going around right now with little-to-no proof to back them up.

I was on your side until the homophobic slur. How is it even supposed to be an insult?

In the example Im thinking of, the user posted his bitcoin address and the transaction IDs so it was pretty easy to see for yourself.
