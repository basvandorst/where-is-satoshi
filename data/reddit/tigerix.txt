Very insightful interview! Thanks for sharing!

htlc.me claims to have 137 payment channels open. But I wonder why this isn't shown on the lightning network explorer?
Also I wonder how does the network explorer know of all the nodes and channels?
@_date: 2018-09-12 09:48:38
Great! Is AMP also coming with 0.6?
@_date: 2018-09-04 08:45:01
Announcement:  
This number will go down soon, because channels will be private by default with newer Lightning versions.
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:06:11
Unfortunately this list is not up to date with developments!
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:37:38
You habe probably opened the page with Safari?
The mainnet option is supposed to be hidden told me Alex a few days ago. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 10:30:30
I think it is very important to discuss things on a technical level and not by emotions.
The OP did a good job on laying out potential problems and challenges of the Lightning Network.
This is no FUD. This is just reality.
I am a big fan of btc and LN, but I am also open to critics, since that is the only way to improve and mature...
@_date: 2018-08-22 08:14:30
Oh, its actually true! Just checked with my desktop browser. Alex has changed the page, allowing Bitcoin mainnet transfers! Great! :-)
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:58:52
Can someone explain in layman terms what this means?
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:31:48
New Lapps for example. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:12:32
As far as I know it's only live on testnet at the moment!
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:49:09
Its already 80 bytes since a few years!
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:14:18
I think there is no technical reason against bigger Blocks. It's just that a Hardfork didn't get enough consensus. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:06:25
Thats not my intention. I want to understand this since I have been reading different claims. One is 75%, another is 85% and 95%. So I wonder what is the real answer.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:31:32
Can this address format only be used with SegWit or is it independently an improvement to the current Bitcoin addresses?
@_date: 2019-03-03 09:30:30
I personally think this looks to similar to the email at symbol!
@_date: 2018-10-20 17:07:30
Casa is selling a full node with Lightning Network integrated!
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:29:18
The future is bech32!
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:13:19
Ok, now I know!
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:45:33
I like the t-shirt. But I down voted this because of the ridiculous price of 60$!
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:44:18
@_date: 2018-06-18 07:40:42
You can really see that Banks want to believe they are not threatened by Bitcoin!
Yes, if all transaction would run through a blockchain, that would be a lot of load, but certainly not break the Internet. Beside that, the majority of transactions are supposed to be happening offchain in the Lightning Network.
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:42:09
Yes, it was great! I was there... :)
That made me hungry for more...
@_date: 2019-02-01 15:06:23
At the moment there is not much use of Bitcoin compared to Paypal.
But that might change!
Imagine you can buy at eBay 5% cheaper when using Bitcoin. Will you still stick to Paypal?
Longterm the price is increasing, so losses are only a temporary problem.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:00:57
But mining is already highly centralized! You can only mine for big pools and only if you have powerful and expensive mining equipment which only a few big players have on the market.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:54:17
But what should not be safe about increasing the Blocksize to 8Mb for example? Bitcoin Cash did it and it seems to work fine...
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:07:35
Segwit is not what you can call Scaling...
Is Lightning really planned to be implemented by Core? 
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:38:49
Thats called a social consensus. If everyone believes something is worth something, then it is. :-)
And the reason this is happening with Bitcoin is very simple. Its a scarce resource! And it has the potential to become everyday money (Thats what everyone is speculating on!) Why is that:  
Because you can send money around the world for very little fees. This is not possible with the current financial system. So if there is use for something - it has value!
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:26:18
Yes that's tue. But with scaling I mean visa size...
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:31:05
Absolutely great!
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:27:02
Yes unfortunately. 
But r/bitcoin isn't better, it might be worse...
Edit: I know it's an inconvenient truth...
Just stay objective and open to other opinions.
 r/bitcoin is about censorship and suppression of different opinions. And that's really unhealthy!

According to [ its  **0.186 btc** /  **$684.53 per node!**
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:34:45
I am really concerned about Telegram Coin and possible Amazon and Facebook Coin. 
What stops them from being faster than Bitcoin and already having a billion user Base?
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:59:52
Yes, but I understood that they will implement Watchtower only with eltoo tech. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 11:09:11
I really question where the data is coming from...
As far as  is telling we are less than that!
@_date: 2018-07-06 07:59:19
Hahahaha, love it! :-D
@_date: 2018-07-27 14:31:36
Wrong, people could already dump it taxfree on August 1st 2017 if they bought btc on August 1st 2016!
@_date: 2018-07-02 07:33:21
Watchtowers are depending on eltoo - which needs SIGHASH\_NOINPUT, which depends on the miners to softfork this feature. So Version 5.0 seems to be far far away... Or am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-07-27 14:53:31
Sometime ago I have researched on the topic of taxes. There was a German article on the topic of Bitcoin forks... (Can't remember where though)
Basically a fork is not equal to buying a new coin! Its like a split of shares.
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:31:40
It would be helpful to also have a qr code for downloading a mobile wallet, so the balance can be checked straight away. 
And maybe a card showing the number 1000 Bits / 0.001 btc  on the front page. So people are excited what they are getting.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:02:06
But is it then possible to route payments?
My node needs to know if it is possible to route it through a certain node...
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:41:41
My hope is that I can use it instead of euro one day!
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:42:27
Who decides that?
I wouldn't take it lightly if Facebook would release a crypto currency. Thy could do it like zcash and demand a developer tax of 20% or something similar. And if every user has a wallet automatically with the Facebook app that would be worrying, don't you think?

I am a btc fan, not scammer Larimer fan!
I wanted an honest discussion about the possibilities of Facebook entering the market.

The problem with your statement is: 
If everyone is using it, it won't matter that it is centralized!
@_date: 2018-12-19 14:32:51
Yes they surely are!
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:57:10
Thanks I have updated my post!
