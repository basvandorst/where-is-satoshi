It only seems that way because you fundamentally don't understand how investing works and why entrepreneurs ([in this sense]( make money. The idea of exploitation in marx's sense of surplus value was not even accepted by fabian socialists ([on page 9 you can see bertrand russell's critique which is completely right]( Sorry but goddamn there is almost nothing that irritates me more than the idea of """"exploitation"""".

[Time has literally never been better for the global poor]( and global inequality has been trending downwards. In fact the only people who haven't been doing better over the past couple decades are the relatively well off middle and lower classes in the developed world. Are the global poor exploiting the developed world?????


yes, sweatshops tend to be some of the best places to work in developing countries (all their options suck). [Read this]( by the libertarian champion Paul Krugman. 


[Foreign aid has worked really poorly.]( Socialism has worked even worse... the best off countries in Africa are also the most economically free (i.e least government control) such as Seychelles, and Botswana. 


I think it's a bad comparison even when people have no option but to work in one specific place or go hungry (which is raaaaaare). 
For example imagine if you have men in descending beauty marked 1-26 and women in descending beauty marked a-z and every person wants the most beautiful. First off a and 1 will marry each other, b wants to marry 1 and 2 wants to marry a, but since they're taken they choose each other as second best, same with c and 3 ( c would rather have 1 or 2, 3 would rather have a or b), and so on until you get down to z and 26. Their only choice is to marry each other, but it's still clearly voluntary. 


All examples of socialism ever were pretty bad, even the technocratic Nehru socialism was not a success.
