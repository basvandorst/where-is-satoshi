Federal grant reviewer here. 'Familiar' with Harvard/MIT we'll call it. Not disgusted completely as above but still. Its not a bypass, its a supplement. Innovative - but questionable, and quite possibly casts doubt on the lab. Can they get enough NIH/ACS funding? Not everyone favors crypto like MIT. Might backfire.
Further I might ask OP: Does David know you are doing this? Is it approved? Departmentally? How about the University? They will want indirect funds if they manage it. Are you going to do that? Is it privately done through yourself or your group?  Overhead, department fee, Chairman, Broad itself, Harvard. There will be accountability for it with some contract management, and without that the donors may not even know where it goes. They must trust you. 
Further the public or donors, much less the Dogekids (sorry) doesn't know that when a university gets a federal or private grant, the cut for the operation of the physical plant is large. F&amp;A at MIT is currently 56%. This is facilities and administrative for all sorts of not really cancer things. It's inline with most other similar places. But 6k turns into 1500 bucks for a piece of hardware, lickety split. 
Do the donors know that it can take a hundred manuscripts to produce a viable small molecular compound for mTor antagonism? A billion dollars? Tech transfer? Screening facilities? 
Overall, good job hunting some funding, and I know hit rates are 5-7% at best for your target audience, but the surrounding questions are huge. The people giving to you have no idea how long this will take, how hard, how much other funding, or whats expected to do good peer reviewed work. I know you want to sidestep and succeed but this is taking a professional risk.

Great idea! May I also recommend a tuning tuner, that sets the bot-reject window time dynamically, so that its not 'one size fits all hours'. There are periods when its actually better to have bots because they add liquidity, and the whole point is probably to allow that, but not let them take over. Its like a governor. You want a little, you dont want much. It could even be stepped or scaled up a curve if you want to build in a function, like, increase the rapid-bot trade penalty proportionally to the current server load. As you approach 35, it gets infinitely harder to get a bot boot in the door. As you fall towards zero, they can come back inside if they wipe their feet and make nice.

There is a mining node at the US Department of State. Does it mean anything?. Interesting at the least. Aows up on blockchain IP address maps

so 22 people have sent 10 bucks to some dude. its not yet one bitcoin right?
the thought remains though, if you have even 1% return on spam, they must be shoving out thouands of hooks, or have a website?

Not crazy about changing the acceptable size of the order if thats what you mean. Trying however to think of a way to dismiss trades from the same ip address at a faster or slower rate, thats different.

I cashed out at 1240, and now I have eight hundred real dollars. Beat you at the peak!
