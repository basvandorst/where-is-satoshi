What a stupid, childish and pathetic "idea".
I'm a supporter of Bitcoin and crypto currencies in general and I think it sucks that Apple removed the app(s), but that's just moronic.

There are many more reasons.
- Samsung paid users to write fake reviews in favor if Samsung phones and/or negative reviews for competitors products ( &amp;amp; 
- Samsung invites bloggers under false pretences: 
- Samsung repeatedly tried (and probably still tries) to game benchmark scores 
- the recent region lock bullshit 
- The family behind Samsung and Samsung itself have been involved in lots of corruption and anti-competitive scandals in the last decades (e.g. 
- etc. 
Samsung isn't the white knight in shining armor fighting the dark knight Apple as many many users wanted to paint them in the last months and last 2-3 years. In fact (or at least IMO and if you dig a little deeper) they are worse (not talking about their products).

Look, your anecdotes are interesting (they really are) but it doesn't change the fact that the majority of the iPhone users are happy with iOS 7 and its new features etc.
Yes, it has its shortcomings and issues/bugs that have to be ironed out sooner than later and usually I would expect more and better quality control from Apple... but it's still an amazingly good OS (okay, maybe not for you) - your rants won't change that.
One of the most pathetic "strategies" in this Android/iOS-fanboy-war-bullshit is to try and depict the "other" OS as sooo inferior and shitty. Face it: BOTH Android and iOS are amazing (with minor and major shortcomings for certain target groups).

I agree... I absolutely agree 100%.
**But**... I still can't get rid of this thought: I was *seriously* planning to invest about 15.000 EUR in Bitcoins back in June/July 2012. And didn't.
Yes of course, hindsight is 20/20, no doubt about that and I **most** probably would have cashed out at $30/40/50 (or even much much earlier) ... but still... YARGH!!! This damn thought burns through my brain and I hate it.
But I still know that I didn't do anything "wrong" per se.
