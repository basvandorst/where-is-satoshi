Fuck AT&amp;T -- Say it with me!! FUCK AT&amp;T
Everyone should be seriously concerned and worried about AT&amp;T's security practices. Here is the story and warning.
Late on Friday night, after AT&amp;T's fraud department closed down, I noticed that my phone service was cut off. As soon as I called AT&amp;T customer service they said that someone with a fake ID simply walked into an AT&amp;T dealer in Pennsylvania and asked for a new upgraded phone and a sim card for my phone number. This is, as I learned, commonly known as a Sim Swap Hack.
NOTE -- I live in California and up until that last minute they would have seen that I was out there.
The Hacker did not have the right SSN or secret pin code associated with my phone, yet AT&amp;T allowed the hacker to take over my phone service. This automatically gave the hacker access to any inbound 2FA. Once he had that all he had to do was reset my personal emails using the 2FA and voila, the hacker NOW OWNS YOU. From there the hacker made quick work reviewing any personal files in google docs, downloading private materials, photos, documents and starting to reset passwords to gain access to all of my financial accounts. Since he had the 2FA from the phone he could easily verify himself.
While I begged the AT&amp;T customer service to kill all access to my number, they refused and said I had to wait for 8 hours til the fraud department opened at 6am PST. This gave the hackers ample time to wreak havoc on my accounts, set up transfers with my bank, and wipe out any crypto accounts they could.
So.... FUCK YOU AT&amp;T -- your gross negligence and disregard for security puts everyone in danger.
EVERYONE -- you need to recognize that this is a very easy hack and AT&amp;T knows about it and is not doing anything about it. As I reached out to report the incident I learned that this is now happening everyday on a regular basis.
