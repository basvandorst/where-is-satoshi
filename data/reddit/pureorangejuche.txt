Dude, no institution is going to chase fake internet money right after half the exchanges dissolve in a massive fraud crackup. Especially when that fraud included a huge amount of lying to banks

Does everyone know that Goldman is NOT building a platform or desk that relies on Bakkt? It was FUD

So has anyone withdrawn any fiat from Bitfinex lately? 
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:59:41
Not if they really have 1 dollar in a bank account for each tether they issued. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 20:51:13
Why would people holding Bitcoin spend it when they could just get everything they want using dollars? Especially if they expect BTC to be up in the future? It doesn't buy anything that a dollar can't buy.

The stable coins are useless for institutions. Their only real use case is unregulated exchanges which obviously institutions will not enter.

That's quite dumb, invest with a 401k and IRA instead

This makes no sense. If someone is sitting on a ton of BTC they aren't going to move somewhere and spend it on random stuff. And even if they do you actually just made the problem much worse by bringing in a bunch of new home buyers. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 20:50:47
What do you mean? It's not like Goldman canceled plans. The plans never existed.

Tether risk premium. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:43:16
So Tether is allowing new accounts to register and withdraw... But they are also unpegging Tether from its 1:1 with USD? How is it a stable coin then
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:26:44
How are you going to sell it if nobody wants to buy?

Wall St vacations to China where they spend their bonuses at Alibaba, then request refunds due to long shipment times and spend their refunds on bitcoin buys. Any day now

How come no one is talking about the criminal investigation involving Tether manipulation? This is separate from the futures trading investigation into BFX that got them subpoenaed early this year.

Is Bitfinex failing proof of keys? 
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:00:55
Why? A currency crisis in a first world nation would push people towards the dollar and US treasuries. Not to mention that China would love to become a world reserve currency too. Treasuries are the baseline for safe assets. If those fail then you are in a doomsday prepper sort of scenario and Bitcoin is the least of your worries.

Please Janet theyre my kids too

But then you are just replicating what already exists. The value proposition to merchants is what? Start taking some crypto now and as long as you picked the right coins there's a possibility that at some point it will become as useful as what you already have?

Institutional investors are paying their analysts in Bitcoin and those analysts are using their bonuses to buy Christmas gifts and the gift retailers are then selling off their Bitcoin stacks so they can buy lambos with cash. It's all very simple and obvious with the right charts 
@_date: 2018-12-04 04:29:22
Except that it hasn't. Uber ate up huge chunks of marker share. Meanwhile Bitcoin has totally failed to penetrate as a currency. Nobody uses it for anything but speculating or evading Chinese capital controls. Nobody is sending a few bucks to Grandma or buying Christmas presents with Bitcoin because they're all holding it waiting for the moon. Nobody cares about trusting PayPal or Venmo or their bank to send money. Transferring cash is free and instant all the time already. You can pay for your lunch from a food truck with Venmo right now. Nobody is doing that with crypto. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:09:19
I don't know what their actual level of investment is but millions wouldn't be a very large entry. It's more of a side project with limited staff. More importantly, aside from them corporate interest in blockchain tech or investment has virtually ceased. If Bitcoin is good why isn't there MORE interest? 
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:06:27
It's true that merchants would love cheaper transactions, but I don't really expect cryptos to be a major alternative to banking. Banks do a lot more than just process transactions. Litecoin won't provide other financial services. Crypto also isn't useful for this until there's enough people actually spending them and so far that isn't happening. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:57:34
That's not really that big of an investment for a bank the size of Fidelity. Plus those compliance and security issues are things they are already good at.

"we aren't sure all our money is there so let's kick off a bank run just to check" 
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:05:27
I'm sure there are some people on the staff who believe in it, but it's not big enough to signal a major entry.
