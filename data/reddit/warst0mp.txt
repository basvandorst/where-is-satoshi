What makes gold a terrible means of exchange is the need to verify it authenticity as being gold and not a scam metal posing as gold. Bitcoin does not face this issue because it can verify itself via a decentralized network built around the concept of security and so it is easier to use then gold. In other words if you offered me a 4k bar of gold in exchange for a good or service then I would need to verify that what you are offering me is indeed a solid gold bar before I could accept it. 
At least that is my take.

I can't wait until I have my crypto wallet banned and all my Facebook coins deleted permanently for not having the "politically correct" and Mark Zuckerberg approved views on everything in life.
So on board with this!!! Where do I get my ZUCKER-Bucks or ZUCKER-coins???

Really what is lurking in the belly of this Trojan horse are SJW's, FBI, NSA, Centralize Banking cartels, etc.... The "mass" are the "masses" because they are to dumb to connect the dots and see the bridge beyond the next horizon. Once let this in they don their horse blinders and miss the forest for the trees so don't expect them to understand that Bitcoin or even any alt coin is a better choice because there is a ZUCKER born every minute and now they'll have digital ZUCKER coins to lose.

Its not a "gateway" if it leads to a dead-end wherein gates close shut behind you.
