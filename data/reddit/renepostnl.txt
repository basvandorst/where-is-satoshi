Over 90% of this growth was due to Reddit by the way.

Hi Pepe, thanks for your condensed reply. Which metrics would you propose as having more predictive power?
Alexa certainly has it's shortcomings, and communities do as well, but combined these figures paint a pretty good picture of what is happening. Something we see huge price jumps, with a community that is small to start with and static or shrinking, an Alexa rank that was terrible to begin with and going down, so you know there is no basis and no reason to get involved. 
So personally I wouldn't say nonsense, but as always there is room for improvement, so am very open to hearing your concerns and suggestions!

Is it your opinion then that it does not make sense to keep an eye on the underlying metrics because there is nothing to learn?
Where did you read that we provide investment advice, or that we want to make anybody rich? Please let me know, so I can correct that.
