This being my first buy and the fact that now I can't cancel and am frozen out of the buying potential for the next few days until my Friday purchase clears has me a little bit upset

Are you going the risky route?  Asking about taking a 401k loan to get some BTC before it jumps?  
I could understand your broker laughing if this were the case.  Given my current situation, I'm considering doing something like this in the near term but am still calculating my risk tolerance.

you can't do it.  I'm stuck in the same boat and tried to cancel in order to buy.  Cancelling is not an option anymore because it is open again. 
I can't attempt to buy any more until this purchase clears.  I'm a little bit upset about the whole thing, just like you

That's it?

I believe that we will also run into a scenario where Bitcoin expands at the rate the monetary transfers are increasing.  It isn't really the small back and forth transactional behavior that is going to drive the price increases, I think we will see them more when $200MM being transferring p2p to and from the oil sheikhs.  Once people start using the currency for very easy large scale transfers, the value will have to expand to accommodate those massive sums.

Amazon, or another massive online retailer.  This is likely somewhere "distant" in the future.
I would guess Amazon will be the first massive retail to adopt bitcoin

not to rain on your math parade, but this would actually be 61.6 bitcents

feel free to purchase 1 Satoshi, if that's what your heart desires.
