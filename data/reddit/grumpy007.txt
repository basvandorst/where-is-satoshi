Fractional reserve banking is not a wholly evil idea. Its implementation in today's financial markets has caused a lot of problems, but it is necessary and doable in a future bitcoin-centric economy.

Any update on your kit?

It just demonstrates the network effect credit cards and banks enjoy and just how far bitcoin still has to go and overcome. I don't think many people would disagree that credit cards are inherently dangerous, the struggle will be in getting bitcoin or some other platform to a point where it can challenge 60 years (generations) of entrenched infrastructure. Change is really hard.

There's a lot of talk about all the different types of products that could potentially take advantage of the blockchain (e.g. mortgage titles, contracts). In theory, how would these objects be added to the blockchain? Does the block size limit what can actually be put into it, or would these types of objects be linked via a hash somehow? I am fascinated by the idea but cannot conceptualize the actual implementation.

Not necessarily. It depends on the wallet used, whether you have backed up your wallet, know the seed (if used), etc. It is possible that you have lost all access in your given scenario, but it would be because you weren't proactive in protecting your holdings.

It is one reason companies like Circle and Coinbase exist, for those who can't/won't/don't want to be their own bank but still participate.

If you can only afford $10 of bitcoin a week, don't shirk that. Buy $10 a week. As your finances improve, increase it, but don't begrudge the relatively small amount. It will add up and if the bitcoin price goes up, your $20 a week in the future may not buy as much as your $10 a week now.

I think this is the right strategy, use bitcoin as a hedge for right now. It is not practical to move all of your current assets into bitcoin.

Ahh, that makes sense, much simpler than what I was trying to work out.

Damn, I've been running both a bitcoin and electrum node for a few weeks, used this site to check up on things, but never knew about this. Thanks!

Anyone know what application was used to make those charts?
