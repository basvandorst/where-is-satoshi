I'm Satoshi and so's my wife!
@_date: 2019-03-10 18:20:54
who knows, but if "he" did have access to the coins I'm sure we would have seen some activity by now
@_date: 2019-03-10 14:16:39
You really think "Satoshi" has access to those coins? Nah

Had a venezuelan friend online like 10 years ago and I can't believe I never understood how her life probably was. We don't talk anymore and I can only hope the best for her.

Regardless devs didn't bother checking whether it already existed or simply didn't care, so users don't really have to care about calling it BCC. There are already 4 letter symbols for other alts (lol) so there is absolutely no reason they couldn't have picked something more suitable.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:43:02
*B*itcoin *C*as*h* it's pretty simple... Bitcoin hcash lmao good job
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:18:24
Find an exchange that isn't as LE conscious? Pretty simple since it's the only option really or a direct deal
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:44:44
Yes of course, but the fact so many big investors are part of it and stuff like bitcoin atms are popping up in the real world, as it grows more there are more people rooting for it to grow more lol
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:47:02
That's Numberwang everybody!
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:35:02
Honestly who needs to be proud when you made $300k in 2 months...
Seriously though Bitcoin price just goes up... and with more adoption and Bitcoin programming it doesn't really make sense for the value to go down. Rich people are putting a lot of money into Bitcoin, too much to let it fail I think, Bitcoin atms are popping up all over and it's gaining more and more coverage all the time.
It is literally the best currency option we have right now too.
I mean this is all stuff you probably already know but I find it so hard to believe the price will not just keep rising, ooooor it could just pop but I don't see it happening. This whole bitcoin cash thing didn't even touch it lol.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:43:38
I'm guessing they're going to stick with it, which will cause more confusion until the coin sinks into nothingness.
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:20:47
lol don't worry, i'm just talking shit anyway it's like 4am night night
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:47:06
Of all the exchanges listed on coinmarketcap it's almost a 50/50 split on the symbol they use lol
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:48:20
We don't really need stories to push prices up, it's the one currency that's easy to transfer, impossible to counterfeit and has limited supply- that in itself is enough. Thing is price is already $3000 and bitcoin is barely implemented in the real world yet save for a few machines. I don't think the price will go anywhere but up as usage becomes more widespread, simpler and... normal.
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:14:11
That's what I mean when I say it could just pop, it's really difficult to gauge how much is pump due to hype and speculation because it's true that there's real value in what bitcoin really is, but the value is entirely decided by demand, opinion and technicalities rather than partly being decided by physical worth such as gold.
I stopped following bitcoini or a while but its really picking up lately, of course the value can't rise forever but at the minute it's pretty difficult to pin where you'd expect it to sensibly settle. Especially with guys like McAfee saying "bitcoin will hit 5 mil guaranteed I can back it up with maths" or whatever, that's the sort of irresponsible claim we don't need..

Here ya go  although it'd be nice if they included hashrate
Edit: oh there we go, comparison of mining profitability is being tracked here 
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:34:44
Apparently transaction costs will never decrease, correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:48:21
You know someone is selling r/bitcoin mugs on etsy right? Also an avert isn't a shill, are you fucking kidding me... BUIP stuff is a separate issue that I couldn't care less about.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:10:17
Really doesn't take a genius to work this out... it's like a more convoluted 6 block pre-mine &amp; pump and dump, miners and speculators can start pumping and sell their minuscule amounts of coins while the price is still "unknown" then when people have access to their coins everyone who put any money into bch loses out.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:37:36
I'm right handed, writing with my left hand is actually easier if I mirror the writing too, it's almost as if the reason you can't write with the opposite hand is because- at least for right handed people- your brain is used to writing from thumb to pinkie so when you reverse it.. yea it's completely useless but was a fun realisation.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:03:18
Honestly he's probably still a drug addled maniac as well as all the poop stuff.
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:18:16
Except every single wallet has been duped so market cap is a little misleading, just as it is with Bitcoin. Think about all those coins Satoshi pre-mined and have never been touched, they all exist on bitcoin cash now too.

And if it is actually going to be targeted at people who don't have a pc or internet then the hardware is going to have to be affordable.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:30:53
If the story is true then why wouldn't there be 950btc on it? Chances are it might be a fake post for karma after the post a few days ago about the guy who said he found 20 something bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:56:53
What is your point? Are altcoins bad? Yes a lot of people involved in altcoins are scammers/pumpers just looking to make money, same with icos which seem to have taken over, but not all of them. It got a lot harder to sort the scam from the legit ever since dogecoin but it doesn't mean they're not there.
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:50:34
nah, both subs are pathetic when it comes to this shit. Assuming everything is done in malice and then responding with things like...


@_date: 2017-08-14 16:47:47
No crystal balls, it could pop again but will keep rising in the long long term, as has happened in the past. We've never seen a rise like this so to expect a pop isn't really that infeasible- but also in that case it's best not to panic and sell since it'll just happen again.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:16:15
lol just transfer to monero and cash out in increments. edit: oops didn't see other comments
@_date: 2019-04-12 14:34:47
Dude, don't call someone stupid over something that's literally irrelevant and you just show that your intention is to feel smarter and bigger than actually caring about the truth.
@_date: 2019-04-25 14:13:17
Oh shit boys it's a dump and pump... wait
@_date: 2019-04-21 16:28:07
@_date: 2019-04-12 14:40:48
Quite possibly, but at the same time, he's a special case. He's been holed up in the same building unable to live his life for several years, he came out of the embassy looking like he'd lost it a little bit. Dude's probably been wondering wtf to do and peddling perception may have been his only option.
@_date: 2019-04-12 14:38:57
but did any of those at risk lives get taken? How about how many individuals he brought to light that are perpetuating abuse or the wrongful imprisonments and insane abuse at guantanamo bay? A lot of stuff has been moved from conspiracy to confirmed thanks to wikileaks. Say what you will about the guy, Wikileaks happening isn't a bad thing.
All we can do as plebs is really make assumptions, we don't know what situations Assange was put in or what he was or wasn't able to do. I see someone else noted that it was the DOJ that refused to redact info. Is this true? Why didn't Assange then just redact it himself? Was it because there were tens of thousands of files to go through and redact, so much that it couldn't reaslistically be done?
I'm genuinely curious cus I don't know about this
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:19:58
but why
@_date: 2019-04-12 18:25:04
No, it was some friendly advice, but you do you

"Oh shit boss they're onto me"
"Who's *they?*"
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:09:39
I believe that's just an unavoidable consequence of a new, decentralised solution experiencing extremely fast adoption and interest. It will stabilise eventually, whether it's in a few years or a few decades.
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:45:15
Ehhh maybe people's problems should be with both? Like it's been said we weren't affected by banks supposedly being a part of fraud activities, why should it be any different. There's no reason not to release those coins back to victims.
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:23:00
It's not called BCC btw...
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:32:14
Is everybody in this thread forgetting the fact that we cant go backwards in time? Which is exactly why all the shit that was just said is nothing more than theory. You just implied that a multiverse or whatever you want to call it, is logical because paradoxes don't make sense. But a paradox can't happen because we can't fucking travel backwards in time lmao so either way it's all just conjecture and neither explanation is more logical.
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:33:43
When authorities want to treat bitcoin as though it's real money *they* can't have it both ways. I didn't lose any money in btc-e but I don't think people should go out quietly when shit like this happens.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:04:36
Yeah but my point is even cryptos are becoming more regulated, so authorities should also not be able to "have it both ways". I'll be curious to see if court proceedings offer the seized coins back to victims as sort of happened with Mt Gox.
@_date: 2019-05-04 09:21:31
People have been doing this for a long time, people are just upset that big names supported it so strongly. It literally turned out to be an altcoin that fizzled out like every other, with a bigger market cap than most but even that is artificial. If someone owns a domain name they have a right to do whatever they want with it. I just don't see what there is to be mad about when there are so many other issues that aren't being solved. but I don't have the skill to solve them so eh guess we just sit and wait, but the fact is that neither bitcoin nor bch are close to being what they're supposed to be.
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:50:54
First of all I don't know anything about this, second these guys were clearly talking about time travel.
@_date: 2019-05-04 07:33:41
Are people still crying over bitcoin cash to the degree of using words like fraud? Fucking l. o. l.
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:56:57
Yup, and so many people are trying to get them out to dump that bitcoin cash will even more not amount to anything. 
I'm just kidding though I dunno what will happen, it's going to be interesting for sure
@_date: 2019-05-04 07:36:41
More wide adoption so that buying directly from another user is reasonable costwise. It would be really nice if it were possible for a kind of bitcoin mining bank to be set up too, a company that mines bitcoin but always keeps a surprlus on hand to sell directly to consumers at a competitive price, I'm guessing this isn't super feasible as a start up because of the power required for mining to be worth it though.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:06:08
I miss those years
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:50:01
I'm not sure.. currently it's proven that "in a way" it's proven that you can travel forwards in time, in the sense that theoretically if you were able to travel it a speed very close to the speed of light then time goes faster for you relative to other observers, so if you were to travel at ~90% the speed of light for x amount of years, when you come back to Earth then Earth would be 10000 years in the future relative to your own time. This is theoretically 100% possible already with "bits of data" or a full human being, albeit a dead full human being. It only takes a novice physicist to understand this.
