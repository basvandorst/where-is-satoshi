we don't know that for sure, they still haven't released details of their finances, or how they apportioned funds to decide the haircut amount.
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:42:49
hmm, well as the number of copies increases the likelihood of losing all of them decreases. Not perfect but it is an improvement at least.
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:57:07
or simply regression to the mean, the recent rise in price was due to unfounded expectations of a bubble, people are now selling as their expectations weren't met.
@_date: 2014-04-13 08:15:52
yea but not as bitcoiny
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:04:53
chop every files up into bits, make sure every bit is stored in multiple places. Means more work but less likely to lose everything.

assuming someone is buying gox what they're buying is a huge userbase. That's quite valuable even if gox is in debt, with decent coders behind it it's a valuable asset.
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:00:53
ah that is a better idea!
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:00:00
there is bad news, the price is falling, people will see that and sell
@_date: 2014-04-24 09:11:54
awesome, been looking for a server that accepts bitcoin for a while, is yours private or do you mind sharing ip?
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:47:41
Well if you split the thing into chunks as well, so that the hoster does not have anything that resembles a complete stealable object it would minimise the desire for theft, the only problem would be unreliableness.
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:53:43
you're an idiot. The guy just wants to be left alone, you're generating more publicity he doesn't want, what the hell is wrong with you?

writing computer viruses and making explosives both require resources, even if not necessarily economic resources. And those are arguably done just to fuck things up in some cases. However you are right that the economic hurdle is a disincentive in this case.
@_date: 2014-06-11 11:13:07
and the people who just enjoy fucking shit up. I think twitch plays pokemon illustrated very well that some people just like to cause havoc for others.
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:16:22
yea, it's straight forward, and it makes sense!
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:48:34
not just Mexico. HSBC also laundered money for an embezzling African Statesman and god knows who else in the UK. They have a system of rules and checks but when someone waves a load of money in their face they throw them out the window.

not really, the idea that embassies are technically on sovereign soil is basically a fallacy. From Qi: It is a myth that an embassy is based on the soil of that country, so the American Embassy in Grosvenor Square (at the time of recording it was being moved) is on British soil, not American. The Americans wanted to buy the lease from the owner of Grosvenor Square, the Duke of Westminster, and he said he would if the Americans would give back to his family the state of Virginia which they confiscated from them during the War of Independence. The deal did not go ahead.

yea well he died October 10th, then withdrawals start occurring later :(
Woah that's a lot of BTC!
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:14:13
oh right, yea the transactions did. Time to lawyer up I guess. An official complaint has been made, we'll see what happens. Thanks for your advice
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:42:30
will do!
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:41:52
really? But we can't figure out where the coins ended up, I will be showing everything to the police anyway.
@_date: 2015-07-02 10:35:48
electrum shows a balance of 0. All these transactions happened after he died whilst the laptop was in police custody.
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:39:45
hmm ok, well it was an address electrum loaded after using his seed. so yea probably someone else has his keys
@_date: 2015-07-02 11:24:06
yea they got sent else where after he died. Passwords were on his computer, which the police were "investigating".
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:43:52
Yea I found it weird that they moved bit by bit
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:19:05
Yea perhaps, but I thought police would have to say that they had seized them. Going to talk to the police soon, I'll see what they say.
@_date: 2015-07-02 11:31:03
beside the seed for the wallet was something with format 8chars-4-4-4-12 any idea if that is anything useful?
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:14:46
the seeds weren't encrypted or anything, just on a text file, what makes you say it was a virus?
@_date: 2015-07-02 11:26:34
right, thanks that's very useful. Unfortunately because his death was unexpected the police took most of his personal effects, including his laptop. I only got hold of his hard drive months later to start hunting. This is looking more and more like a bitcoin savvy policeman saw some easy pickings :(
@_date: 2016-05-04 10:29:13
Well in cases in the UK involving HSBC it seems they did not follow the procedure, so it was either conscious choice or incompetence.
@_date: 2015-11-01 15:19:24
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:45:24
well yea if someone sells gold for BTC, that's a really good idea! Someone tell BullionVault to accept bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:30:43
they said in a comment above that they were going to introduce a new crypto-currency but current events took precedent so it's been pushed back a few weeks
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:19:53
if the confidential information is anything to do with users info they probably can't release it without a court order because of privacy laws. I don't know anything about this case though so maybe it's nothing to do with that.
@_date: 2013-08-05 11:03:46
could care less? so he cares to some undefined potentially infinite extent?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:12:25
well they rely on these nothings for income so I think they do have a lot to lose. They create these virtual 'nothings' to offset server losses, if chargebacks were a big interference their business model would not work.
@_date: 2013-08-05 12:32:54
fair enough :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:27:10
yea I don't think it's as much of a problem as people think. Hundreds of online games take payment for virtual items with no problems.
