The risks aren't inherent to the transactions/blocks verification mechanism as you mention, they rather cling to the TOR network properties.

Using Electrum over TOR isn't really recommended. Besides new account with just one post, take it with a grain of salt.

The lack of instructions about installing from source, and the fact that OP links to a packaged version leads me to think that this extension might be unsafe.
Keep your eyes open people, check carefully before trying or use dedicated VM/hardware. DO NOT try this on your wallet machine.

Please, go get a life. And get a dictionary as well, you don't know the meaning of "ad hominem".
I am specifically enraged about your ways of placing etiquettes on people based on a previous mistake, which unfortunately is the norm. Because the world is full of pieces of shit like you.

Happy cake day Jason, there's people out there supporting you. Don't listen to the scums

Startup idea :
Bitcoin / smart contract powered Tour operator
Example use case
1) Collect payment in Bitcoin from customer
2) Instruct a smart contract to emit a voucher for amount paid above. Smart contract will automatically pay who will redeem the voucher after a X amount of time
3) Customer shows voucher at Hotel, voucher is checked for validity 
4) Smart contract expires, Hotel is paid automatically and without trust required.
5) If voucher is not reedemed  smart contract will refund the customer

You do worse, you target vulnerable people, someone who have had huge issues in the past and is trying hard to make it right. How would you feel if you had the same experience ? would you appreciate people mocking you as a drug addict ? Now go and fuck you, idiot.
