The USD should be used to buy stocks and those stocks appreciate in value far more than the dollar falls. Be smart and convert most of  your fiat to stock if you don’t need to spend it in the next 6 years.
Invest no more than 5% in crypto if you like. More than that and you are taking a risk that can really undercut your chance at retiring.

If you have enough to matter to the family you need that plan for sure. I would recommend the following: 
2 safe deposit boxes. 
1 with the Ledger in it and half the password. 
1 with detailed Instructions on how to use it with the pin and other half of the password. 
And before you lock them up get your spouse to follow the directions and see if they work for transferring some fraction of a coin to an exchange followed by a sale and deposit of the funds into a bank account. 
If you are hiding this from your spouse and dont care if the money is lost forever that is another story.

Just own as much as you can afford to lose. In fact, expect to lose it all and you won’t be panicked during downdrafts. And if it comes to pass that the investment utterly fails it will not impact you overly much.

Close. Because the risks can’t be assessed they can’t say it is suitable to any client. Just shows that they think crypto is beyond speculative or that they know anybody who loses when it tanks will claim they were put into a ridiculous investment and they’d prevail in the FINRA Arbitration that would ensue.

Everybody who had bitcoin at a lower basis has sold it to someones who acquired it a a higher basis. Now it is falling to earth and those people are realizing they are left holding the bag, and they sell at a loss. This is classic bubble economics 101.

If you are young you don’t need to be good. Or lucky. You just need to be invested in equities and continue to add to your holdings through the bad times. Over a long period of time equities rise (crypto has no history to speak of so don’t treat it like equities). 
Don’t pay attention to claims of daytraders. For every 1 that makes anything worthwhile, 100 are losing money. And half the folks who successfully made anything wind up losing it before long. 
The path to wealth is to spend time in equities until you don’t have time left or you have amassed enough to hit goal. Then you cut back and acquire bonds.

There is no “inside” when it comes to bitcoin. It is not like a share of a company where there is information “inside” the company used to trade the company’s stock. 
What you have here is a government official who knows his words will impact the market for the asset he owns, and trading ahead of disclosing that information. While the information is “inside” the government, it isn’t “insider” trading in the regular sense. It is just a government official acting on information he has. Much like a stock analyst who knows his report will impact a stock price can trade ahead of his publication.

It might work if the beneficiary is an adult who understands crypto and LastPass, and has a LastPass account with a password they don’t forget when you die. Would work less well with multiple kids unless you trust them not to screw one another.  
Won’t work for a young minor. Won’t work if you’ve got a testamentary trust to take care of your kids. 
Won’t work if LastPass goes out of business, though if it did you would presumably have figured out an alternative imperfect solution. 
Having assets that are not titled and held by a trusted third party has its benefits. Easy transfer of wealth upon death to one’s children or multiple beneficiaries in a secure fashion is not one of them.

You mean “not require verification”?  I can tell you that a lack of knowledge almost guaranteed you will lose what you invest.  Buy it where  along mistakes won’t kill you.

You can absolutely keep the keys in the safe. With a bank account you die and it transfers over to your selected beneficiary.  If you have a testamentary trust, the money can go right into he trust and take care of your kids per the will. 
With crypto in the safe, whoever opens the safe can swipe what you have and nobody would ever know.  So, unless you have a way to guarantee your beneficiaries  are the ones that open the safe and will act together in a trusted fashion, you have no safe way to transfer your cryoto according to your will.

No, you are stretching words to the breaking point to make it fit a concept that doesn’t apply. Think Madoff:  give me your money and I will get you  9% returns. You give him the money. He gives you 9%. Only it isn’t coming from appreciated assets but from new money attracted by the same promise. 
That is simply not the case with bitcoin. Nobody is promising anything. Nobody is pretending to generate a return on your money and making it appear successful by giving someone else’s money without their knowledge. 
People may be pumping and dumping but it isn’t a Ponzi scheme. You are confusing the sirens of high returns and gambling that ensues, with fraud.

You are only looking at what your money is worth if you fail to invest. That is a foolish thing to do because inflation will eat you alive. Putting your money to work for you in a time-tested disciplined matter keeps you way ahead of the game.

I will grant you that people should know a number of things that could be set up in a FAQ,  that could include the following:
1) The transaction costs may eat you alive depending upon a number of factors. Perhaps one day they will actually be made clear. But for now since it is trustless your pretty much at the mercy of some collective. 
2) There is absolutely no recourse should someone guess your private key and steal your funds. Fortunately, it is a million times more likely that you will lose your key and funds than it is that someone will guess it.
3) For larger transactions you are on your own should a seller decide to screw you because there is no way to dispute the transaction. Your recourse is to sue, so make sure you have a contract or at least a receipt for what you were promised.
4) There is no easy way for you to pass your private keys on to your heirs without risking their loss. Good luck with that.

Poor analogy.

Thus, while you may BOE like the KYC rules you benefit from them to an extent.

I went on television many years ago to ask a personal finance question on CNBC’s money talk. I had a high paying job but owed as much as I earned in a year. It was useless but the advice I received was to both pay down debt and invest in the market. I was looking for deeper analysis myself. 
In any event paying debt is a guaranteed return so if the rate is high enough it makes sense to get rid of it. On the other hand if it is low enough you can live by the mantra that nobody ever got rich paying off a loan.  If paying it off means you have less money “doubling” in the market sometimes it may be better to just pay the minimum and invest the difference. But that is a personal choice and again depends on rates, risk tolerance, etc. 
Good luck to you!

That sounds so ridiculous. Even if it were true, nobody should be storing their dollars in their mattress. While the cost of goods has gone up during that century, and will likely continue over the next century, it will do so whether you are using dollars or crypto to make your purchases. 
If one had put their savings to work for them in 1913 they would be worth quite a lot by today.

So much jargon and so little communicated. I realize there must be meaning behind the mantra spewed by so many. But once I would like to see it unpacked.  
“Open”:  Today this means anybody can acquire it if they have fiat to do so. 
Borderless: It may be exchanged across the globe. Much like the Dollar. 
Permissionless: I don’t know what this means. Nobody needs permission to trade bitcoin or dollars for goods.  Some countries may ban the dollar. But they are free to do the same with crypto. Both would operate in the black market. 
Consensus driven participation: don’t know why this is remotely important. Probably because I don’t understand it. But to the extent it is intended to describe how blockchain works it is a tautology and does not convey any meaningful sense of benefit. 
What it seems to do from my perspective is create a system that is very costly to meaningfully participate in.   Consumers who uses it to buy goods and services are hurt because they can’t cancel a transaction with a fraudulent merchant. Merchants are helped to the extent they are committing fraud or eliminating the ability of a consumer to charge back/dispute charges for non-confirming goods. They are also helped to the extent it eliminates fraudulent charge backs. 
But it all seems very merchant oriented and anti-consumer. 
As for a store of value, that depends entirely on what you paid for it and what some other is willing to pay you for it later, assuming that it isn’t stolen from you by a fraudulent or insecure wallet.

So, “Open” means the original is essentially useless from a monetary standpoint.  Having the old output of code that has evolved to produce something better means what exactly?  I am not saying the blockchain technology can’t have a purpose. But owning the original BTC token versus an improved one isn’t exactly justified. 
“Borderless”. You really can’t take bitcoin on a plane either. You can’t take it anywhere.  It isn’t physical. If I had need for a large amount of currency in another country, bitcoin would the advantage if it actually behaves like a currency. If my hometown currency goes down in flames, a cryptocurrency will be better than my currency for sure. 
Permissionless:  Ok, for 99.9999999% of transactions this is irrelevant. At least in my country. 
I agree, that the system has value to a tiny fraction of owners in the developed world. But it needn’t be BTC to provide that benefit, and the overwhelming majority of people in the developing world who own it will see no benefit from owning it (though there may be a net benefit or harm to the world, because of it). 
That it is expensive to use and of little practical use to the vast majority of people with money, means that those people who are driving up the price because they “believe” it is it will become worth something in the future, are misguided. Just my opinion, of course. 
But if we started with bitcoin and someone came up with the currently prevailing system, the world would beat a path to the inventor’s door. 
People would be like: Finally, a system that protects me against theft, that pays me for using it, that doesn’t make me wait minutes or hours to complete a transaction and which gives me someone to talk to if something goes wrong!

I’m close enough to 50 to qualify as older. Check out M1 Finance—set up a portfolio of your choosing (say 70% VTI, 20% VXUS and 10% BND) and make regular deposits to the account. Hit the rebalance button once a year on your birthday. If you want to also invest in individual stocks set up a second portfolio. You can include Brk.b and anything else you like and buy fractional shares in proportion to your chosen allocation. 
All commission-free. 
I should add—it took a long time to accumulate my wealth. There was a long time when the markets were not returning anything at all. But having a lot invested meant when the market took off, the wealth snowballed. So keep at it. Invest everything you can as early as you can and hopefully by the time retirement comes you are sitting pretty.

Ok. If the printing press made money it did so by creating things of value. Like newspapers and books. 
Blockchain is free. It is open source. One use of it was to create the bitcoin which has no particular value other than to exist as a medium of exchange which, at the moment, is more expensive, more risky, and less useful than fiat currency.  Your analogy is like saying using the printing press to create pages of gibberish means the gibberish had value. No, it did not. Some thing created by the press had value and the potential allowed for printing presses to also have value. 
The Internet is pretty much the same. It allowed for the creation of things like google which has value. But he internet itself is free and can not be traded though monthly fees can be charged to access it.

I have over $2 million invested in the stock market and more than $500,000 invested in Bonds. I have purchased stocks when they were in the dumps as well as at their all time highs for over 25 years. What I KNOW in my bones is that the markets go up over time. 
I own BTC, LTC, ETH, and XRP.  What I know in my bones is that they will all be trading at closer to $1.00 than $1,0000 in time and they will NEVER recover. I don’t know when it will happen. Could be tomorrow could be in six years. So, invest what you can comfortably lose and not lose any sleep over. Maybe you get lucky and make some money.  Maybe a LOT of money. Maybe you lose it all. But do not look at it like a real investment. Do not believe for a second that it will always go up.

What would an even playing field in a developed country look like to you?

1) Show me an open source wallet that lets me see the code on my iPhone once it is installed there so that I can verify what I download is what they claim it to be. 2) Then show me ONE person you trust who has verified that the code I downloaded generates random words and does not relay those words back to the coder. 
Then show me a single wallet that won’t require updating as time goes by and tell me how long you think you will wait to update it, so that you can make sure of the above.

Oh. So it is impossible to lose bitcoin because the recovery pass phrases for restoring private keys could not possibly be generated by someone who keeps track of them?

It is a little odd that to be secure you have to shut yourself in.

Certainly, ease of use is important for there to be  mainstream adoption. But more important than that is for people to see a need for it.  It needs to be useful and for that to happen it must fulfill an actual need. 
The ability to dispute charges is what makes cross-border or non-face-to face consumer transactions safe. Otherwise you are just setting yourself up to be fleeced. Sad but true. 
Given the choice between paying for something in a manner that gives a rebate and the right to dispute a charge for goods that aren’t delivered and paying for it something in a manner that costs me fees to do so while losing the right to return makes about as much sense as going to the barber to have my teeth cleaned.

Counterparty risk applies only to those who sell and not at all to those who purchase. At least, as a consumer, I have never had an ounce of counterparty risk. Been buying stuff for 45 years and never had to worry about counterparty risk using a credit card. 
If there are a million people using it to buy stuff what is it worth if a billion people are buying the same stuff at the same price and earning rewards for doing so?
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:14:31
Right, so one can lose the equivalent of 15 years of purchasing power overnight with bitcoin. Meanwhile, the price of goods will continue to rise whatever you use to purchase them. 
You are correct. Nothing is free and the bitcoin gains are made by taking outsized risk. And, likely, people will be burned by that risk. Bitcoin is about a hundred thousand times more risky than owning the dollar. While some are being compensated for that risk, fewer and fewer  are compensated enough in my opinion.

If what I sell you can’t be sold for more than you paid and only can be sold for less, it is not because it ever had value to bleed. It is just that people are more educated or less willing to speculate than you were.

It is worth this only because of pure speculation that greater fools will come and buy it at a higher price. It is the very definition of a bubble.

It is the utter lack of trust (any wallet maker can steal your balance unless you know how to code and can otherwise verify that their wallet is generating a random key) and the fact that when it is stolen from you it can’t be recovered.

I own BTC, ETH, XRP and LTC. I do so because I believe there will be greater fools than I, who will pay more for something with no value than I did. 
I have 570 times more invested in the stock market than in crypto currencies, which I consider to be the ultimate form of speculation. 
I do so because stocks give me ownership interest in companies that pay dividends or are otherwise valuable and are run by people with fiduciary duties to maximize the value of what I own. And because historically, equities return 8-10% a year and over time that means one can accumulate millions with little risk. 
If I am wrong on the crypto and It actually grows substantially in value, I get richer. If I am right, it hardly makes a difference to my bottom line if it crashes before I get out.

It isn’t the number of fees that matter but the size. And who pays for it. Right now the option is to NOT pay a fee and receive a rebate for using a credit card or PAY a fee. I’m pretty good at math. Perhaps not as good as you, but good enough to see making money is better than spending it.

Think about the difficulty you will have if your private wallet provider does something nefarious. It’s great in theory to be your own unregulated  bank.

I don’t make $700 an hour. But I make plenty. I don’t see how banks are screwing the middle class. If you want free checking and reimbursed ATM fees it is freely available to the rich poor and in between. If you want to invest $100 into 100 stocks at no charge, that too is freely available in the US. Want to buy a home with something besides cash? Your inability to do so has nothing to do with the banks but with the people who are selling their homes. 
The cost of goods increases regardless of whether you are paying with dollars or bitcoin acquired through labor. Though surely if the price of bitcoin rises than the bitcoin you own will buy more though the time needed to acquire more of it will increase correspondingly. Which is to say, you won’t be in a different boat by getting rid of the fiat currency. You must still work to get the coin and work more to get more to buy more. 
The problem is not with the currency. It is with the consumerism.

Perhaps. But whether you need to satisfy the need to consume by working for or borrowing dollars or by working for or borrowing bitcoin makes no difference.  What is happening is that that the rich are fleecing the poor with bitcoin. The poor just don’t know it.  Like lottery tickets.

How about this? I feel guilty about making money off of the stupidity of others and actually want people to understand the risk they are taking so that my conscience is as clear as it can be under the circumstances.

Got it. So there are two ways to get to the new world order. One, which is for people to exchange all of their fiat currency for Bitoshi and have merchants only charge Bitoshi. Another is for people to pump the price of Bitoshi up by paying more and more for their Bitoshi so that the Bitoshi can be sold for fiat currency, as is happening now. 
Both of which will, of course, keep the rich rich and the poor poor. Though some will get richer and some will get poorer in the process.  But, at least there will be no evil central bankers to deal with.

If people pretend a satoshi is worth a dollar and a coin worth 100 million dollars than there will be enough value for the planet wide adoption and use.

You pay that same fee when you pay with cash. Or bitcoin. You are not seeing merchants giving discounts for alternative payments. And so, I am paying less because of the rebate. In a different world where visa and MasterCard are put out of business and blockchain actually works and where you lose the ability to dispute charges, double warranties, get purchase protection and return protections, I won’t have to worry about it because I will have lost everything and be forced to pay with whatever merchants are accepting. But until that time comes, I will be part of the problem and earning my rebates.
