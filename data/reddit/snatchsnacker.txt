I already have cointracking, but I would pay for this app

The JP Morgan report estimated that 6 billion in fiat had been put into the market when the cap was 300 billion. Others have estimated that we are at 10 billion total fiat today resulting in current market cap of ~500 billion. 
So, removing 2 billion fiat would leave us somewhere between 300 and 500 billion cap. This is based on variables which we cannot verify, and since absent any other factors (such as the panic selling which would obviously occur).

True, but it doesn't mean you can only withdraw on one specific day each quarter. It only means you have to hold longer than a quarter. Which, for their target market is obviously long enough.

It wasn't hacks per se, but a bunch of people who fell for a phishing site. 
They detected the compromised accounts being accessed in real time, froze the accounts, and rolled back the trades. Apparently the phishers ended up losing their own money. Sounds pretty proactive to me.

Cointracking is actually not very intuitive. The importing process for every exchange is different. Sometimes it doesn't receive every transaction. Sometimes it identifies the coins incorrectly. I don't have the answer yet, I'm still trying to figure it out myself.

Well it's twice as secure!

This makes a lot of sense to me. What would be the downside of further encrypting my private keys? Even a simple cipher like rot13 would be better than storing it in what is effectively plaintext.

Just zoom out bro. Respect the trend.
