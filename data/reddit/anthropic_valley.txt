This is what I’m looking for!!!
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:40:06
Please I’m looking for genuine serious theories or answers.... 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:35:55
You sound salty but ok. Was just trying to generate an interesting convo or hear new ideas I haven’t before... but you know you don’t have to comment on things if you’re so bothered?
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:29:10
Wow that’s bold. What makes you think so?
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:29:50
HAHAHAHAHA. I’m looking for someone who can substantiate their claim! Come on guys 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:34:26
Ummm more like some 20 some girl who is really into internet privacy, really got into bitcoin, and is obsessed with how one person can maintain such privacy. All out of curiosity. Also, if I were a writer reddit would not be a credible source LOL. This is just for fun, no need to get paranoid
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:36:48
This is why I’m so interested! I’ve done research into this aspect but I can’t pin down a solid idea on who they or he could be without finding holes in my own thinking 
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:33:56
I mean why hire people with technical skills only to have them do (very much) less than perfect work? It’s clear that SN is no expert in coding. Also the name part is a near dead giveaway. How would you interact with previous ideas about the British newspaper / British location... red herring or no? Curious what you think. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:26:45
Yes okay I don’t know if I’m excited by your reply because it is in line with my own thinking, but thank you for sharing!!! I appreciate it so much. I wanted to gauge what the reddit bitcoin community thought because all my classmates and friends know nothing or don’t know what I’m talking about and it’s nice to be having a conversation like this!! I have follow up questions if you don’t mind or just like, do you think that it’s more possible that it was someone in the banking industry or an activist? Or do you think SN is definitely in the tech industry? 
Another thing I wanted to ask everyone about but didn’t want to be annoying is estimated of how many BC Satoshi is sitting on and hiding currency like that... I mean I guess if he never exchanges his digital assets for cash, he’ll likely be pseudonymous forever.
Oh another thought I just had! At what point will SN back out of his own idea? Like how low would it have to drop? I guess to nearly nothing since he created it out of nothing. 
Ahhhhhh so many questions about this fella. I’d kill just to talk to him and pick his brain about privacy and decentralization of currency. And wow breaking the double spending issue is like... someone give this fella a nobel prize or something, lol. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:42:38
Huuuuh. Yeah. Real or red herring. Could honestly do a coin toss on that one. It could be a red herring intended to disguise a British identity by making it so obviously British? 
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:18:12
Okay but you don’t think that someone like Satoshi would so obviously give their location away? Or that they/he couldn’t mislead everyone to believe it was British? 
Say you’re right.... how can such a huge detail be discovered but the identity still secret? :0 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:37:14
Nice! Thanks! Definitely top 5!!! 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:45:54
But they’re FUN! Lighten up! Can’t we just theorize and talk and share ideas? I’m just curious what other people think, tired of keeping my thoughts to myself and wanted to share. It’s harmless really I’m not asking for a full out investigation.... just comments on a Reddit thread.. 
Also, “noobs” probably don’t even know the name SN to be real with you. Even people with decent amount of BC, I’ve mentioned the name to and they gave me a blank stare. Only people who care about internet privacy or are actually invested in bitcoin more than just the money but for the idea of a somewhat decentralized exchange are the ones who are interested in conversations speculating about SN
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:46:54
I like that idea a lot. I always thought it was a group of cyber activists bc of the low coding skills needed 
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:32:19
I like everything you have to say though and you’ve totally changed my mind about what I previously believed by the way! 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:31:04
This made me laugh at least 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:47:47
Agreed! That’s why I wanna hear what us common people think lol. Just wanted to start a conversation (that would be fun for me), i haven’t heard many ideas besides my own and one friend’s so I came here. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:32:59
Yeah this what I am also leaning towards! Wanted to see other ideas but thank you for validating my own hahah 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:39:08
If you could develop the Hal finney idea a bit further... someone else mentioned it but in a joking manner. I’ve never heard of the Dave Kleiman + Hal theory. You have my attention! 
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:30:50
Oh OF COURSE he deserves to have his identity hidden forever. I am in no way trying to uncover it. Even if I were I wouldn’t start here. I sort of came to this thread just for exchanging ideas and theories for fun! No harm and no one going after SN. If major governments haven’t figured it out, I double that I, some 20 something year old girl, could do it from some ideas strangers share on a thread. I promise this is all in fun and I totally respect his privacy, I’m also just fascinated by it, considering how difficult it is to truly be this private in this digital age. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:15:38
Hahaha. I wanna give u an internet hug for just making me laugh. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:43:18
Believe what? Sorry lost you at the end 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:37:59
Do you think they have the capability and also why would the Japanese government be so private about it, as well as using such an obviously Japanese name? 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:41:08
Wait okay, since people are giving me shit for asking this question. I wanna say that I agree with you, up to the old age part. My theory is that bitcoin was created by cyber activists??? Same concept but perhaps of a different age. I would be down to believe it was an individual over a group though because of what you have to say
