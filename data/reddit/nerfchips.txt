If you just found out you are absurdly rich would you come back to Reddit to tell strangers about it or would you have better things to do?
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:31:11
Isn’t that called Libertarianism?
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:17:30
I disagree because a pyramid scheme has no other purpose behind it. Bitcoin gathers value by acting like a pyramid scheme, but the purpose is to give people an independent reliable currency. Many of us care about adoption, and adoption drives up the price so there’s that.
@_date: 2019-07-27 09:13:12
Yes, but actually no.

Thank you for your service.

No need to say it is a pyramid scheme. You might not change people’s minds but it’s not good for anyone if you reinforce their misconceptions.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:29:26
I am confident the US$ 10k resistance will hold.
@_date: 2019-03-02 10:08:21
But also because women are more risk averse, perhaps?

@_date: 2019-08-10 10:08:13
What’s the problem? It’s been hovering around 10k€ for some weeks now. It’s a great value to stabilise on.

There needs to be more bitcoin ATMs in Europe.
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:20:12
Because by then everybody will believe this prediction and sell right after it reaches $56k. Then bitcoin will fall to $87.

I didn’t even know this existed... how very inconvenient :-/
I wonder if it would be illegal for people to offer to sell/buy bitcoin in airports. Like, just go there with your phone and do the transaction on the spot.

I was living like that but the high number of drops made me run out of money. Now it’s hard for me to get excited about a drop :-/
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:10:26
Same. I almost sold some yesterday after the big slump. Glad I changed my mind.
@_date: 2019-08-09 22:50:03
It’s not only about having an advantage over competitors but also coming up with a common set of rules and standards that facilitate trade. So if the entire world was an economic block, it would indeed benefit everybody simply because business would become more efficient.

The market cap was much lower though.

9000 is the hardest value to leave behind. I blame Vegetta.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:44:45
So you sold at a loss?
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:37:53
I really don’t think so. The 20k resistance will be brutal. I expect the next ATH to be around 30k and it might take more than a year. At this point the price is high enough to prevent it from going exponential - 100k might be a reality but only some years from now.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:38:32
When did you sell?
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:50:32
I was prepared for it to go to zero, to be honest - but as soon as it stopped dropping I was sure it was going to rise again. 
For me, either bitcoin dies or it will still rise a lot. For it to die, in my opinion, some fundamental flaw has to be found. Otherwise the number of people knowing about it and adopting it will always grow, meaning the price will keep rising.
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:24:22
They are. Top genetic material.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:40:18
Did you buy something already?
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:17:09
Agreed. Maaany people will sell at 10k. But it’s nice to see us going back to 5 digits.
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:58:07
Depends. Are you cute?

I invested in bitcoin AND hired a prostitute.
Paid her in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:22:56
Glückwunsch! Felicitazioni!
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:42:35
Agreed. And last time it was also way too fast. There was certainly manipulation going on. 
I know bitcoin is making progress when the next “dip” is higher than the previous one. ATHs are about manipulation.
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:19:17
But most people follow the price in USD.
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:31:24
I seriously doubt it. 2017 was a great year to invest all year round, and I was only able to motivate two of my twelve colleagues to try it out. And we work in IT! I can imagine that for people who are not tech savvy the hesitation is even higher.
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:36:14
The creator has an end planned. It doesn’t make sense to push a series beyond its planned end.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:53:12
Absolutely. If bitcoin actually stays around 18k-22k it will be an incredible accomplishment. I don’t see it happening so soon, though. Maybe in 2 years.
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:10:13
It might. Or not.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:39:50
Probably manipulation again, like in 2017. It’s too fast to be organic. I expect it to reach perhaps 20k and then it will go back to 10k and get back to “normal” growth.
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:44:59
He rich now.
@_date: 2019-06-29 07:44:08
But you can’t ever know so why even bother thinking like that? Timing the market is extremely difficult and can bring a lot of frustration and stress - besides potentially making you lose even more money. If you believe the price will continue climbing (with its ups and downs along the way), hodling is the simplest strategy.
Besides: in Germany if you hodl for more than a year you can sell your bitcoin tax free. So that is also a major advantage (at least here).
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:04:17
The last bitcoin post was surprisingly positive.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:13:01
“Lower lows” - that is really not true. Every low is considerably higher than the previous one so far.
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:50:52
From which year?
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:00:20
Aaand it is gone.
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:57:12
So theoretically the price should drop when that happens? Since it will remove some incentive to mine Bitcoin I assume the transactions will take longer and cost more and make the asset less attractive.
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:31:40
It dies every couple of years when it “crashes”, according to the media. Then it suddenly becomes a terrible idea and the target of jokes everywhere.
I am astounded by how these people don’t look at the big picture and realise that bitcoin has increased in value at an incredible speed, in spite of the crashes. It’s really not that hard to see.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:35:03
I don’t think the market cap can increase that fast.
@_date: 2019-06-20 11:09:13
It’s really not that hard to explain. Even to people who are not familiar with technology at all.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:47:24
Growth that comes from adoption, meaning that normal people buy and hold some bitcoin as part of their portfolio. Like me and a couple of friends started doing after the last bull run - while most of them still don’t know anything about bitcoin. 
Every time the number of people doing that increases, the price rises a bit. And it’s a stable growth because these people don’t want to part with their bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:06:29

Too many people set sell orders at 9000 because of the memes.
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:21:49
85% here! But unfortunately I didn’t buy much.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:44:50
It did have trouble - it went right back down.
There is a limited amount of resources in the world and there is a slow adoption of bitcoin. We can’t expect miracles, it is wiser to be patient.
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:37:49
Because I am on vacation? Bitcoin always rises when I am on vacation.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:42:02
Exactly. I notice the same. I don’t think it will go parabolic like 2017. At least not yet.
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:05:44
Dude don’t tell the internet you have 10 bitcoins!
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:51:27
I am not an expert either, but I think it’s when some agencies buy a lot of BTC to drive the price up, wait for people to FOMO and buy, which puts the price even higher; and then sell everything they had bought with profit - driving the price down again.
@_date: 2019-06-25 08:50:08
After you get this rich you start getting bitter about “small” things like this.
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:32:51
Me too. I bought it exactly because people were talking about it, when it was about 3k. It’s fine to buy in the middle of a bull run or even at the end, as long as you plan to Hodl. These huge dips are always temporary.
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:51:06
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:35:51
If somebody found a flaw on the code that allowed anybody to, for example, create Bitcoins out of thin air, it would go to zero in a matter of days.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:56:21
It means 4x the current market cap! It would mean, as an example, that suddenly everybody you know who has bitcoin was able to convince 3 other people to have bitcoin.
4 of the people I know currently own bitcoin. I cannot imagine that in the next months suddenly 16 of my acquaintances will have bitcoin instead of 4. Nobody is even talking about it anymore.
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:01:33
Dude you gotta take it easy... otherwise you are doing it wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:43:41
That’s why I didn’t sell any bitcoins back then. I am just saying that going to zero is a possibility, albeit slim.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:17:16
There is no science behind that.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:51:25
I admire your optimism but I don’t believe it.
One day, sure - but it will take several years.
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:25:25
That’s silly. Bitcoin should always welcome everybody.
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:25:01
Me included. I am really surprised. Doesn’t look very organic, though. I still expect a heavy drop before we go up to ATH again.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:40:57
Fapping = suffering? Interesting.
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:34:38
If he didn’t sell any of it I’d say he is doing better than many people around here.

@_date: 2019-06-22 08:52:08
Not the IRS. I live in Germany and if I hold for more than a year then it is tax free. 
Back in the year when I started experimenting with bitcoin I did some buying and selling. Not much but officially I owed taxes for that year. So I declared them.
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:23:51
@_date: 2019-06-24 06:43:13
The people I know didn’t want to hear any “education”. They just wanted quick bucks and they resent me for even explaining to them what Bitcoins are. 
Good thing I don’t interact with them anymore.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:35:08
When it hits 20k there will be a major sell off because it’s the previous ATH. This is probably gonna break many platforms already.
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:28:39
And what are you gonna do then?
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:27:49
The media is dumb.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:01:17
People seem to forget how absurd the rally of 2017 was. It was not sustainable at all. I prefer a more steady rise so that people don’t consider bitcoin “that asset that keeps crashing”.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:17:04
30 is totally possible. I really like this one.
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:26:04
20k will be really tough to pass. Even I am planning to sell some at 20k and I am a heavy hodler.
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:47:27
Oh no!
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:36:25
It was much more complex in 2014 to be honest. 
I started with $50 like you in the beginning of 2017. I have learned a lot and the whole experience has been really fascinating. I highly recommend you do the same.
I even “lost” some bitcoin when I accidentally moved it to a lite coin address (this is no longer possible btw) - and managed to get it back with the help of fellow redditors. It was all very exciting and not really an issue because the values were low. 
If you want a very easy start, go to Coinbase. After you get some bitcoin there you can learn about other exchanges, hardware wallets etc.
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:10:50
Americans talk about $5,000 as being a big deal, but the real resistance happens at €5,000. I have been waiting for it to cross that line forever.

Bitcoin is keeping the markets afloat confirmed.
@_date: 2019-04-10 22:45:04
Yeah. Wake me up when we cross 20k.

As long as the next low is higher than the last one (3.5k), bitcoin will be making progress. That is all that matters in the end.

This is the last time it will trade below $1
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:53:25
It will take a while but it will come. 
I wonder how many people who bought at ~15-20k were strong enough to hodl and wait for a recovery. Those people have nerves of steel and I hope they will be rewarded for it.

It’s still a counter argument to the currently common trope of “Bitcoin worst investment ever hurr durr” that got really strong after the December 2018 crash. 
I guess people don’t realise that a boom like that had to crash down just as fast, but in the long run the price of bitcoin will stay way over 20.000.
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:22:12
As soon as I realised that it was not going to zero I bought more as well. Also feeling pretty happy about it. 
So far in my life bitcoin has been the best (and most interesting) investment.
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:42:30
I always enjoy those.
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:08:33
I would expect the seller to pay the fee. When I buy something using credit card or Paypal, the seller also pays a fee to them and if there is a refund, the seller loses money.

Last time it was also hard to go past 9k. I also blame Vegeta. Crossing 10k and beyond was much easier.
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:41:37
But I want to do something for it because it is something I care about. If a company accepts Bitcoin it will have a better chance to earn my business. The same way I choose to buy a product from a company with values that align to mine and boycott those with values that contradict mine. It’s not charity, it’s just the normal way that personal values shape business decisions. 
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:15:37
I even locked mine up in a secured location not in my house. I am so lazy I will probably HODL until 2045.
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:53:51
For some reason the price fluctuates much more around 9k than 10k.
