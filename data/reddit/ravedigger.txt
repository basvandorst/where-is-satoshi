Newegg announced that they are now accepting bitcoin!  Show your support there!

I treat craigslist the same way.
"Oh, you want to buy my car?  Meet me at my bank with $9500 in CASH."
"Personal check?"
"Banker's check?"
"No, just cash."

I don't really need anything at the moment, but I bought an athletic t-shirt anyway to show my support!
Edit: I'd also like to add that if you're afraid to spend your bitcoin for fear that they'll be worth more in the future and you'll miss out on that appreciation in value, you should do what I do and replace your bitcoin as you spend them.  I spent roughly .02 bitcoin including shipping.  I promptly replaced the spent bitcoin so I still have the same amount of bitcoin in my possession, but I am still able to support the bitcoin economy!

You make it sound like it's no big deal.
I prefer to think of it as a major online retailer conducting almost 10% of their business via bitcoin.
I'm a glass half full person though, YMMV.

Naughtyamerica.com also accepts BTC payment as well.

There is a rumor that Asicminer is bringing a ton of equipment online.

This actually points out a huge advantage for consumers of subscription based businesses.
Ever had to jump through hoops to cancel a service?
* Waited on hold for an operator?
* Transferred to four different departments and disconnected at random?
* Needed to provide a letter in writing?
Those are credit card problems that are solved with Bitcoin!
Edit:  This is not intended to be a reflection on ChunkHost's service or ease of cancellation.  Just a general statement.

Register and verify an account on AMHash.com, then use the transfer link and it will walk you through the process.  One thing to note is that you can only transfer AMHash shares.  Also, any funds you had stored on the hashie site are gone.
Basically this is what the form looks like: 
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:41:47
The AMHash cloud mining service is legitimate, however it was being resold through Hashie which is obviously a scam.  If you owned AMHash through Hashie, AMHash will help you transfer your hashing power out of Hashie and into Havelock or directly to AMHash.

Ahhh good call. I checked the address and there have been a total of 48 transactions. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 10:20:34
She never printed a new wallet.  She handed me an already-printed piece of paper with a BTC address on it.  I'm assuming that everyone who has paid in BTC at that restaurant sent their BTC to the same address.
@_date: 2015-08-10 03:18:15
Uhhhh the post was about the fact that I stumbled upon a business that accepts bitcoin and their food was delicious.
@_date: 2016-02-07 22:06:22
Can you recommend a better service?  I'm still using Coinbase to do a weekly auto-buy, but I'm not enthused with many of their overreaching policies.
@_date: 2012-01-28 06:57:56
This is true, but fucking with the postal service is a federal offense.
@_date: 2012-01-27 22:59:22
Hmmm, I'm guessing that this is probably a serious crime in the US.
@_date: 2012-01-27 21:52:27
How does one order to a fake mail address?  This seemed to be the only flaw with the system.
@_date: 2012-01-27 22:50:56
That's genius!  I never would have thought of that.  Are you in the US?
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:07:20
I'd steer clear of bitinstant.  I placed an order and was charged way over the market value of bitcoins at the time.  I had to contact almost every day to convince him that a mistake had been made.  This morning, I was refunded the correct amount.  It took almost two weeks.  I suppose I should give kudos to them for making it right, but I'll never use their services again because of the amount of work I had to put in to make them realize and fix their error.
If I could make a suggestion, use campbx instead.  I've been very happy with their service.  You know beforehand exactly how many bitcoins you'll receive when you initiate a purchase.  With bitinstant, it's a wild guess.  Speaking with their support team, they base the value of a bitcoin on information from preev.com or bitcoincharts.com, I think both of which are based on mtgox prices.  Either way, bitinstant doesn't tell you up front how many bitcoins you should expect to receive.  In my eyes, this is a huge problem.

I really like the coinbase app on my android phone.
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:04:21
I am having a tough time with bitinstant as well.  I had the attached very frustrating conversation with where he asked me for the same information over and over.  In the time it took him to have the conversation with me, he probably could have taken a quick look at the facts and determined that I was correct and remedied the situation.  Instead I'm stuck waiting for a support rep to contact me.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:08:20
I have yet to contact their support department regarding this, but I may have to.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:07:57
It may end up sucking for the government, but they'll end up passing some of that suck onto us.
@_date: 2013-07-24 21:38:33
I need more services like this where I can spend my bitcoins.

He could hang a QR code on his belt that says "Tips" and people could tip him from inside their offices through the glass.

Wow, I just realized that they'll ship boxes of cuban cigars to US addresses for bitcoins.  I'm in Havana Heaven!  Thanks for the link!

This is my first try with bitcointip.  If all goes well, you'll have a little bit more.

I got so burned. I had 9 shares when they were about 5btc each. I don't have the heart to sell them at this point so I just hold on to them in the hopes that they might someday get back up to 1btc each.

I don't need anything from zpacks unfortunately, but I'd like to purchase something with bitcoin anyway to show my support.
Does anyone have any experience with their fleece hat?
I'm not crazy about the giant logo on the forehead so I'll probably wear it backwards.
@_date: 2013-06-18 23:59:20
I've never tried that, but I will say that once your cash is in campbx's system, it's easy to buy btc. You know exactly what you're paying and exactly how many btc you'll get. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 18:00:25
I'm curious how many of these posts we're going to have to see before people wake up and realize that bitinstant is not the way to go.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:34:38
If I had cash in any of my online accounts, I'd be buying BTC like crazy right now.  I'm waiting on a fucking slow-ass Dwolla deposit to clear from my bank account.

I haven't gone though the motions of setting up a truly secure wallet because at the moment I don't feel my balance is large enough to require protection.  If I do end up with a balance worth protecting, I'm going to reference your postings.  Thanks.

When you're configuring the authenticator software on your phone, the web page gives you a QR code to scan that creates the authenticator profile on your device.  I printed this QR code to PDF and saved it someplace safe.
Coincidentally, my phone soft bricked yesterday after a VZW update and I lost all my data during the restoration process.  I used the QR code I had saved on my PC to regenerate the authenticator profile on my phone and I am still able to log into my account.
Having never tested the process, I was a bit nervous that it might not work as I had intended, but all is well and I have breathed a sigh of relief.

You're welcome.  Just out of curiosity, do you know how long a refund is expected to take?  Am I looking at a few days, a week, or a month?  It's been about 4 days so far.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:29:20
I noticed a sudden drop in price.  It's an attack that's causing this?  I'm newish to bitcoin so I'm curious.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:39:11
I'd be ok with that.  I have about $500 that I'd like to spend on BTC.  I'm planning to be in it for the long haul so I'll wait patiently until I can get the most BTC for my $.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:58:59
I noticed that today too.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm using Cyanogenmod, but I was able to expand my widget a bit so everything fits on one line.
Edit:

Yep, any time the price dips I just buy more!

Lucky break!  Honestly, I think we (the users) are the biggest danger to our coinage.  I don't worry about getting hacked or my coins being stolen, I worry about fucking something up and losing them to the bitcoin gods.  It's sad to me that there are a large number of bitcoins in limbo that will never be retrieved or spent because one of us forgot the private key or accidentally deleted a wallet.

Yeah I'm having a pretty frustrating time with bitinstant as well.  I placed an order for $470 worth of bitcoins and was charged roughly $79 per bitcoin when both mtgox and bitcoincharts showed the value of a bitcoin at roughly $60.  Supposedly submitted the conversation I had with him to their support department, but it's been 24 hours and I've still not been contacted with a resolution.
I guess I should be happy that I got any coins at all!
@_date: 2013-07-03 16:40:16
Haha, I'm glad too otherwise I'd be out 30 BTC!
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:07:56
That's my whole issue with the offline wallet thing.  I feel like I'm too likely to screw something up and lose access to my coinage.

Who the fuck is Wufoo?
@_date: 2013-08-06 23:37:03
Yeah and some of the questions they ask are just plain wrong.  
Q.  Who owns the lien on your 2003 Nissan 350z?
Well I paid it off completely and then sold it a year later.  No one owns the lien on the 350z and I don't even own a 350z anymore.  I answered "None of the above" and failed verification.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:37:43
That's super helpful and it sounds like will make it right.  I've sent him a PM and will report back here with any developments.  Thanks psapsaps!
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:01:48
I received my refund this morning.  Thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:25:56
You have.  I made this post almost a week ago before I had received an appropriate response.  I've edited the post to reflect that I've been in contact with you and I'll update it again once I've received my refund.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:50:51
Yeah I'm having a problem too.  They're basically useless.
Edit:  I have been contacted by and it was determined that I am owed 1.8 bitcoins.  I have still yet to receive them, but I will update this post when I do.
Edit 2:  I finally received my refund this morning.

Damn, if they had any restaurants where I live, I'd definitely use this.

Dwolla to campbx works well, though ach transfers to Dwolla are a bit slow. At least you don't get screwed by bitinstant though. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 18:50:48
If you get in touch with someone, keep on them to make things right.  I think most people have had their issues resolved eventually (mine took about 3 weeks), but it requires that you be the squeaky wheel.
