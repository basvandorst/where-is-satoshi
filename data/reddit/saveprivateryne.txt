If you need it quickly I use Circle for that. I use Gemini for buying that can take up to 5 business days because it is very slightly cheaper.

Not even a fan of Johnson but that's awesome. I wish Stein would do the same.

I knew someone would downvote others. You are stupid. Way to ruin a good cause! I hope someone you downvote wins!

Haven't they been working on a workaround for this?
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:22:28
I understand that. Although you could have the centralized aspect for quick transactions and then decentralized for things that don't need to be instant. Right? 
Also isn't this why fees went up a while back? Wasn't that supposed to speed up confirmations?
And I'm not talking down on you or anything. I've been using bitcoin for years but I'm always curious about how it really works and what the future holds for it.

How well does it work for you?

Oh yeah. Not a fan of him. Just that someone in his position is willing to be open to it. Even if it is for shitty reasons.

Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2016-08-17 03:26:45
Yeah. Not a huge fan. Just thought it was cool.

I suspect that's what he means by represent us. But yes, I was confused as well.

If you check their site it sounds like banks do.
@_date: 2016-11-18 03:58:52
Yeah. It was just a joke. But let's see in a week where it is at.

So you are telling me, a young, single, male with a frugal lifestyle to throw all my money into it? You just sold me.

I've used Circle too but always send to an offline wallet. If you don't need them immediately when you purchase them then gemini is also decent. Takes like 4-5 business days and just slightly cheaper than circle. Again though, I always send to an offline wallet immediately after purchasing.

I'm really glad that encouraged people to get involved but from the 30-45 minutes I saw of that movie it was painful to watch.

Spot on. That's why when I buy stuff with bitcoin I use an exchange like Coinbase, buy the amount I need plus about $5. Spend what I need to and save the rest. (I know the fees are stupid with Coinbase) For a small price I support bitcoin as a currency, save a little, and get some goods or services out of it.

And if you read their statement about it they talk about how Washington State is very regulated with how they handle exchanges so it took a while to work out the details.
