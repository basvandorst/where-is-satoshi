Very nice web wallet. Thanks for putting that up!
Improvement suggestions:
* Switching to Euro would be great for us non-Americans
* Enlarging the QR code by tapping on it would be nice. Our Lamassu had a hard time recognizing the tiny QR code on my iPhone

Actually, you can pay with bitcoin – but not at the eventbrite website. You'll have to click the correct button on the bitcoin2014 website:
That's a little confusing and it took me some time to find out how to pay with bitcoin. A friend of mine had exactly the same problem and ended up paying via credit card. Definitely room for usability improvement here!

Every centralized service will have glitches from time to time. You'll have to trust Coinbase to resolve issues like these.
The only alternative is to use a real Bitcoin wallet which let's you control the private keys of your addresses.

I actually know the person giving the talk. Having debated with him I know that he's not necessarily pro bitcoin. But he's very well educated and open to arguments. I'm sure he will try to give a balanced talk.
@_date: 2014-06-08 09:11:57
Nice idea. But the coins you're sending to the address are potentially lost because anyone can recreate the private key to the username address. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:29:51
Quick summary: they are providing infrastructure for hierarchical deterministic multi-signature (HDM) wallets in combination with an "Oracle". This is some kind of intelligent algorithm that analyzes transactions before co-signing them. Low risk transactions (small transactions to known destinations) will be co-signed immediately while medium and high risk transactions could be delayed for confirmation or denied at all.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:41:59
Some really valuable insights here. We need to make p2pool as attractive as GHash.io for people like OP.
Is there some fund where we can donate to the development of p2pool?
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:11:25
I see. Still, I wonder how long your 0.0002 BTC will stay in that address ...

Great, when was this aired?
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:01:37
Looks very nice. Is this open source? Also, would be great to be able to switch between BTC, mBTC and bits display.

That is interesting. My experience was quite the opposite, the Coinbase merchant app was stable and worked very well  (on an Android tablet) while the Bitpay mobile checkout page was very unstable and often did not work (again on an Android tablet).

Agreed, 20 GB is nothing. Not trying to imply anything here.
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:05:51
Did you reply to clarify? I always found the Digital Ocean support team to be very helpful. So if you didn't use your account for mining then I'm pretty sure this can be cleared out.
@_date: 2014-07-19 08:09:40
Your app looks like the perfect wallet for a Bitcoin beginner. Making this open source would be a great thing and I would really encourage you to do so. It's almost mandatory for a wallet app to be taken seriously.
@_date: 2014-07-06 07:56:05
Great, thanks for putting that up! All info seems to be correct.
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:46:41
I think I know what you mean and I too would prefer having a community acting out of pure interest in helping the cause. And as far as I know, there are already some people working on p2pool and trying to make it better. But still, p2pool is far less attractive to miners than GHash.io.
If we had a budget, let's say 200 BTC, we could hire some really talented people to work on this for a couple of weeks. I'm not sure if this would be possible without money involved.
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:23:30
Very nice! Would love to see bitcoinaverage as exchange price source as well.
@_date: 2014-07-16 20:33:47
Please consider making a dedicated merchant app with kiosk mode (Coinbase's merchant app is a really good reference). This would be much easier to use than a web app.

I don't know what this chart is showing but it's not possible to "mine millions of Bitcoins" in just 10 days. 10 days of mining in 2013 would give you a maximum block reward of around 36000 BTC.

He does not have a dedicated web shop yet, but you can just send him an email and tell him what you're interested in, you'll find this email address [here]( Also, don't forget to mention that you are a Bitcoin user so he gives you the discount.

Yes, this address was shown on safecoin.io: 1ARjWDkZ7kT9fwjPrjcQyvbXDkEySzKHwu
My guess is that they expected a rather big percentage of investments coming from BTC. But instead people were sending ~70% Mastercoins.

Awesome move, that sure will help bring more merchants on board!
Obvious question: how do you make money? Or is this a losing deal to quickly gain market share?
We're helping merchants accepting Bitcoin in our city and I have a couple more questions: 
* Are you also paying SEPA transaction fees or do merchants have to pay this?
* Are you planning to release dedicated merchant checkout apps (similar to Coinbase)?
* Are you planning to localize your interface? Would love to see a german backend.
* Are you planning to do a redesign of your backend interface? To be honest, the current interface is not really the best from a usability standpoint.
Thanks for your answers!

@_date: 2014-07-20 07:29:08
Thanks for that. After reading your other post it seems we're in a quite similar situation. I too help local business accept Bitcoin and I'm still looking for a reliable way for them to do so. I had problems with both Bitpay and Coinbase, and I'm looking forward for their competitor [Coinzone]( to officially start their service.
*My BitPay experience:*
Actually, after trying 5 or so kiosk mode apps I ended up with the exact same app you posted for our Bitpay merchants. It does work in most cases – but unfortunately it sometimes won't display the Bitpay site at all and the merchant would not be able to create an invoice. I'm not sure if this problem is related to the kiosk app, but as long as there's not dedicated merchant Bitpay app I have to use some third party kiosk mode app.
*My Coinbase experience:*
I too had problems with Coinbase because of multiple accounts I created for our clients. At some point invoice creation just stopped and I contacted support. They told me that I was allowed to only have one business account and one personal account. While I'm okay with that, I was really angry that they just deactivated the extra accounts without even letting me know about that! Also, there's no note on their website about this rescriction.
I then established a better relationship with their customer support and now actively report any new account for a business, to make sure it does not get flagged. That's annoying, but it worked so far.
From a technical point of view, the Coinbase merchant app is much more reliable and easier to use. So I'm really hoping that Bitpay will create their own merchant app.

The thing is, I'm not even sure what the poster wanted to say by taping the article to our window. Did he try to "warn" others about Bitcoin? Did he try to tell us to shut down our business? 
You're right, a debate probably won't change my view on Bitcoin but it would help me understand the intention of the poster.

This is the concept for a p2p Bitcoin &lt;&gt; Fiat exchange. It's open source and does look very promising – it potentially could remove the need for centralized exchanges. 
The core concept is really smart (the slideshow on [coinffeine.com]( explains it quite nice). Taken from their [github page](

I tried the pre-installed Asus browser, Chrome and dolphin browser. I thought that Chrome should be working with Bitpay but unfortunately it's not.

I guess they weren't expecting such a huge wave of coins on the MSC side (over 47,000 MSC sent already). 
@_date: 2014-03-14 08:01:07
I guess the vast majority of trades today is done by users who already own BTC and they could use the new system right away. 
But you're right, someone without any BTC won't be able to use this kind of exchange and needs to get some BTC first (localbitcoins, Bitcoin ATM, centralized exchange).
@_date: 2014-09-18 08:21:22
Does anyone have a link to an official document regarding this decision?
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:53:45
Good idea, but this would mean that we would need to provide subsidies constantly in order to keep p2pool competitive. 
I would prefer taking that 100 BTC to pay developers to make p2pool better and stronger.

This is a good example of how false information gets spreaded by journalists by just copying information without checking for validity first. 
This place is not a bank in any way and it's certainly not the "world's first dedicated bitcoin bank". The origin of this wrong assumption comes from a german article that got picked up and translated by an english blog and since then gets copied by other news outlets.

I really don't understand why he's always playing down the possibility of a 51% attack. To me that's quite an irresponsible attitude as it gives people a false feeling of invulnerability.
It's just pure nonsense that we would be able to fix this attack within 10 minutes by "kicking them off the network" as if there was a "bad boy switch" we just need to flip.

I my opinion, EB is the best show on the LTB network. Especially this episode.
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:55:52
First of all, we are an information hub for anything Bitcoin related. Many people come by to talk about Bitcoin. They've heard about Bitcoin before and are curious what it's all about. We're explaining the basics to them, we're helping them setting up their first wallet, how to keep their Bitcoins safe, where to spend them etc. etc.
Also, we're helping local businesses accepting Bitcoin payments in their stores as well as in their online shops. And we're trying to establish a "Bitcoin neighbourhood" and to motivate merchants in our area to integrate Bitcoin in their business.
Currently, we don't charge anything for these services, we've been idealists trying to spread the word about something we believe in.
But we do make a small profit selling Bitcoins through our Lamassu, which actually is the first Bitcoin ATM in Austria: 
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:14:11

True that everybody can view the network. But not everybody has connections to hundreds or even thousands of nodes, which gives a much broader view of the network state.

@_date: 2016-06-17 06:54:37
I think I don't fully understand your point. Assuming that the network could handle larger blocks safely (let's say 2MB blocks), what would be the problem if the bitcoin blockchain would also be used to record stock trades? In the end these would be transactions someone is paying a fee for.
Why do you think the block space would be "flooded immediately" when raising the block size to 2MB? We already have transactions from Counterparty et al and they are not the reason for the current overload. Regardless of a transaction's purpose, you need to pay a fee to get included in a block. So what would be the difference between a 1MB and a 2MB block?
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:40:56
ATH measured in local currency? Or in BTC? Or in USD?
This would be an important information as the local currency currently suffers from hyperinflation.

I know that teespring.com probably does not have Bitcoin payments out of the box. But hey, it's a Bitcoin T-shirt, it seems clear to me that people want to pay with BTC. They should use a different service.
@_date: 2015-07-18 19:19:54
You're right, it actually is a "Bitcoin vending machine", but the term "Bitcoin ATM" became a common term.
We do have a phone support number for people who don't know how to use the machine. Also, we're currently creating an explanation flyer for beginners. These will be available at the machine next week.
@_date: 2015-07-18 19:02:22
There's a limit per hour for anonymous customers as well.
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:53:11
Holy macaroni. That's what we were hoping for (it would be the correct decision) but never expected to become reality anytime soon. Let's hope this will become the official ruling.
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:37:11
Thanks for your comments about the company or the machine!
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:46:01
You can't pay with BTC there – yet…
Thanks for testing and reporting here!
@_date: 2015-07-29 15:04:46
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:51:06
Correct, this is a one-way machine. We might install a 2way ATM at this location if there's enough demand, but not before autumn.
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:02:39
That's correct!
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:46:47
As someone who uses bitcoin on a daily basis, I need my transactions to confirm quickly. Today I had real problems because of 2 transaction that are still unconfirmed (after a couple of hours). 
I love bread wallet and I'd like to stay patient here but in this times of a "stress test" bread wallet unfortunately is not the the right tool for me. I'll have to switch to a wallet with proper fee handling in the meantime. But I'm certainly looking forward to the next bread wallet update.

Cool thing. If you have any suggestions, please let us know at office Thanks!

Thanks a lot for testing and the valuable feedback, really appreciate that! We are aware that there currently is a problem with the touch display and we're already working on a fix. We have a phone support hotline available for customers, so there's always help available in case of problems.
We'll also take a look at the QR confirmation issue you described, thanks for your suggestion.

There's a 4% fee, including Austrian VAT.

No, it's a global limit at the machine (for all unidentified customers). It won't sell more than a certain amount per hour to unidentified customers.

Thanks .Just made a test transaction and the TX confirmed, so this would be a good solution for now.

Very well done! How can we add new services? Contacting you via the form? Or is there a way to add services via GitHub?

Just installed the update and everything is back to working again. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-04-15 05:30:14
To be honest I did not use the 500 bits and already repaid them. I just wanted to see if it's working.
This seems to be an easy way to get a small amount of BTC quickly. I hope it's working out and there are not too many users abusing the system.

Sounds interesting – I sent you a PM.

This has nothing to do with a private blockchain.
@_date: 2015-10-26 10:41:16
This is a donation campaign organized by volunteers, so nobody is forcing you in any way here. You can decide how to use your BTC and obviously you are not going to donate them – that's ok, and I respect your point of view.
Of course the situation in the EU currently is fucked up, of course there needs to be something done on a deeper level. Of course the solution is not to absorb all of these people but to tackle the real problems in their origin countries. And of course I demand from my gov that they do their best to the stop the war in Syria. 
But until the real and underlying problems are solved, we have these people who do need urgent help. And it's my understanding of humanity to help them.

Have you been on location, have you talked to the people this campaign is about? Probably not, but please correct me if I'm wrong.
I have been on location in Austria and have talked to these people – and yes, these people are refugees. Most of them are fleeing a war and they need help, it's simple as that.
I know that the whole situation is very complex and I'm not talking about political implications. But I'm talking about people who need help right now. You know, that's called "humanity".

That's a good point. Definitely an advantage to have this already tested out.
@_date: 2015-10-13 21:04:18
Actually, this campaign is for SIM cards – not for cell phones.

How do you know that this particular website was the reason this malware got installed on your computer? 
@_date: 2015-02-04 11:58:04
We are running this site and took this comment very seriously:
* We made an internal check and did not find anything.
* We contacted our hoster and asked their security team to take a deep look into this, they could not find anything.
* [Virustotal]( is reporting our site as clean.
I think it's fair to say that our site has nothing to do with the malware you reported.

We just don't know. From my own research, Bitmine seems to be a legit company. Of course, they can't guarantee shipping dates because they depend on Avalon chips sent to them. But all in all, it looks like a solid business. 
KNCMiner on the other hand seems to be a bit fishy and I'm not sure if I would place an order there. But I guess we just have to wait and see.

Problem is that I don't know in advance which account the transaction should go. Think of accounts as labels. Here's some examples for labels I would like to use:
"This tx was already processed", 
"We had problems with this tx, check again", 
"This tx's amount was less than expected" and so on.
I could of course use an external database to store this kind of information but I would prefer using bitocind and the blockchain as sole data source.

Small problem: according to my region settings I'm using a comma as decimal point.

That depends on where you're trying to sell your bitcoins. Mt Gox for example has a very large market, you probably can sell your coins there within seconds. At smaller exchange markets it may take some time to find a matching buyer.

Seems legit, I'll add it to the list.

Maybe a dedicated Twitter app could help. We could set up a quick website for people to conntect with a "Bitcoin Twitter Trend Storm" app. This would just be a simple Twitter app with write access to the users Twitter profile. You just click a button, Twitter asks if it's ok for the app to post to your profile and that's it.
Now let's suppose 10.000 people connect to this app and our app posts a message to all their profiles at the same time. Would that make  trending?

Yes, I could that (and probably have to). I just want to avoid tx fees, which could add up when doing lots of transactions.
@_date: 2013-08-20 09:20:44
Oh man, get your coins off the exchange asap. Go to  to make a paper wallet. This only takes 10 minutes. Or, even better, have a look into Armory bitcoin client.
@_date: 2013-05-31 19:50:34
True, thanks for pointing that out. Will fix this.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:38:07
Great, thanks for the link!

bitaddress.org is open source and you can run it locally on your offline computer.
@_date: 2013-03-12 10:49:55
Man, this absolutely nails it.

Best would be to watch the Auctions section at bitcointalk:

Yes, bitcoinaverage has the rates, but there's no "currency converter". I want to type in a given amount of Euros and instantly get the equivalent amount of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-08-28 19:00:23
Thats's pretty cool. I'm a musician / producer and asked a couple of music / sound companies if they would accept bitcoin – no success so far. Very happy to see you accepting bitcoin!

I know how the guy looked before the "hair upgrade", so it looks kinda photoshopped to me, but hey I like it :)

Good idea, thanks!

I know all the admins are working hard to get this fixed – thanks for that!
But even when there's nothing new to report, that would be a helpful update too. Not everbody is following all the different sources (reddit, IRC) and I guess most of the users go straight to bitcointalk.org and keep reloading the page. A little statement there would reach all concerned users.

Why do these miners have BFL cases?

In principle, this is an awesome idea. If we implemented this for every email client I guess we could really get rid of spam.

According to this chart bitcoins will go back to 35$ soon
@_date: 2013-05-31 15:15:01
Yes, you're right. I'll get rid of these.

Feature suggestion:
Say I want to receive 20 EUR on one of my coinjar bitcoin addresses. I'd be great if I could go to "Fair Rate", enter 20 EUR and then get a "receive" QR with my address and BTC amount embedded. Currently I can only select to *send* a certain amount of Bitcoins.

I like how the image on the BitPay server is named "hair-guy.jpg":

You're asking this in the bitcoin subreddit? :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:00:03
I didn't sell because I don't wanna convert my bitcoins in dollars or euros. I don't care about the exchange rate. One bitcoin stays one bitcoin.

Holy 55,000 BTC transaction!

Just ordered a Pizza, salad and some beer – all went super smooth. Laszlo paid 10.000 for this pizza, for me it was only 0.095 BTC. 
@_date: 2013-08-24 14:43:43
Yes, you're right on that.

Good or bad sign? I'm not sure.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:31:03
These look great! Also, I think these would look great on various BTC websites. Any chance we get a single coin on a transparent background as PNG?
