He is describing litecoin. Lol

Impressive.

I have read that even with an ideal quantum computer the exponent is only half. So if you have 256 bits its as easy to crack as 128bit which is still incredibly difficult.

Hardware wallet? Does it contain a custom ASICs chip?
@_date: 2015-05-28 00:20:31
Definitely possible to run on a raspberry pi. It looks almost like a pi with a screen.

What do you mean "WHY CAN'T I". Of course you can. Nobody is stopping you.

Different levels of economic turmoil generally have deferent mediums of exchange.  By having btc. You will have more options which means more preparedness for more situations.

Bitcoin will be a good currency to have durring the depression that leads up to the crash. Ammo, gold, silver would be a good currency for the crash.

Nope. Bitcoind downloads a large bit of the blockchain into ram and then it stops downloading until my cpu has verified what is has in its cache is valid. This takes a while for the cpu to verify before it requests more of the blockchain.

Verifying blocks consists of fairly simple calculations.

Is this a windows computer?
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:14:01
Which will make security a business model too. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:20:02
Did Satoshi add a block limit at all?
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:11:05
Depends on how much you are holding. I hold a couple of btc on my android phone with a backup file on my pc incase I lose my phone. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 21:40:26
That sounds completely unecessary. People try to protect their bitcoin like crazy. I would just boot into a linux live system and use bitaddress.org to generate a few paper wallets with the same private key and then just keep 1 in a hidden envelope, other in a safe or different location and you could be set. Maybe im just not paranoid enough. I will put $1000 dollars in an envelope and hide it somewhere in the house and I think thats sufficient. I personally dont think anybody needs a super fany hardware wallet and all that uneccessary crap. It's like to guy who buys a safe to store his money but then he realizes that he spent so much on the safe that it wasnt worth putting the remainder of the cash in it.

Ask if different people can post their checksums. If say x people have the same checksum, the larger x is the more reliable. U kinda have to use your own discretion on this this. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:34:24
What if we let the market decide and let people be able to pick the block size that they want their node to accept?
@_date: 2015-03-27 13:49:48
So true. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:58:47
Actually. Just compare the downloaded code from the code on github. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:23:16
If you built this site all by yourself I will be impressed. We need more people like you creating new things for bitcoin. Guarantee almost everybody on reddit cannot even make a website as good as this. I do believe there are enough gambling sites out there but if you are making some btc then way to go. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:17:11
Try to find a checksum from a reliable source and compare it to the checksum that you generate
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:05:14
I agree. But I do wonder how the non tech savy people view bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:55:05
I think the 1MB limit is a good thing.  I will continue to host a node that only allows 1MB blocks. I believe that the competition over block space is good. I like the way bitcoin is. Why is everyone always trying to make changes to the source code. If u believe that the 1MB block size is a flaw then you should put your money in another crypto you believe is better.  
@_date: 2015-02-22 11:24:28
There seems to be less and less freedom in this world and people are starting to open their eyes and see this. People want freedom but are sometimes apprehensive of going against their local government. Bitcoin decentralized nature makes it extremely free and because nobody can prove you own a private key you can keep your bitcoin hidden and still appear to be a loyal citizen to your governement.  
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:24:53
I have looked into bitcoinj but I do not have any coding skills in java. It also looks extremely technical. I am looking for something a little simpler. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:38:13
Do you have any solutions for this problem?
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:21:25
I am just throwing ideas out here but what if we increase the block size to 20MB. If all of the blocks get completely filled that would be about 1TB increase in blockchain size per year. I feel that this would make individials like me less capable of hosting a full node. Wouldn't this lead to centralization?
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:24:00
I feel that eventually this would still lead to centralization. Most of the transactions that happen on the block chain are extremely small amounts. When block size starts to become an issue people who are sending very small amounts will have to think twice about it. If satoshi coded bitcoin to stop giving out block rewards in 2140. Then he must have though far enough in advance that 1MB is sufficient.

Almost everyone who accepts bitcoin without waiting for confirmation runs the risk of double spending. My assumption is that it isn't worth the time and effort to try to double spend btc when most vending  machine items are less than $1.

Luckily im an electrical engineer. This isnt an improvement is asics. This implementation has been around for a long time and mastered by most chip manufacturers. 99% of all bitcoin asics miners are already implementing this scheme. if they werent they would never be able to reach the hash rate they are at now. Actually, almost every integrated circuit that pretty much exists that requires an addition fucntion implements a look ahead technique. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:22:00
Surely someone has thought of a way to overcome this obstacle. Does this mean in a world that uses bitcoin that vending machines will not exist?
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:19:03
Verilog or GTFO
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:15:46
The way that keypairs are stored in bitcoind use a database similar to the way something like mysql stores data. Pretty much you could store so many bitcoin keypairs in one wallet.dat file that it would take hours for a powerful computer to locate them. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:03:18
Can a side chain exist without any change to the original bitcoin source code?
@_date: 2015-02-22 18:56:01
Im talking about the freedom from laws enforced by governments.
