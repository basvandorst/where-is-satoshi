Thank you for your feedback here. Is there a better way to accept BTC? Currently payment from sales lands in my account as BTC

That makes sense. Completely understand if it needs to be removed for that reason.

Is there anyway of setting that up with the current checkout that I'm using?

This is fantastic advice. I will look into improving how I accept BTC moving forward. First test is today. No one's bought using BTC yet but we'll see what happens  !lntip 500

It's just a tipping bot on here. You can pass the tips forward if you like and improve your karma a bit

You'll find the bitcoin option at the final point of checkout. Price subject to minor variations.

Will do
