I really don't know what this means/ . iso image and hex search sector is chinese to me ... I am on a mac, any specific step by step instructions to do this?
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:11:21
That is what i wrote down on a piece of paper ... its just a public address but i thought it was a private key at the time ... regardless, i must have created this address using SOME interface at the time that I wrote it down ... so the key is figuring out what interface so I can just type the password
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:49:18
If there is a way to do this with the terminal please share.  Otherwise I did it by searching in the top right and found nothing
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:21:50
Have to figure out what wallet I used to generate that public address ... Any step by step guidance would be very helpful.  I;m on a MacOS Mojave
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:47:09
This is a Mac OS Mojave .. I am not on the desktop trying whatever I can ... Some of your suggestions are great but Im not computer literate enough to know how to do.  I literally just know how to search my desktop using the search bar on upper right of the desktop or by clicking the finder and searching the MacHD for certain words ... Have zero idea how to use terminal
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:51:36
Lol.  Indeed, I have come to terms with a loss here so I appreciate whatever smart ass comments come my way, they are well deserved after all.

Yes it was a typo.
I do have my wallet ID.
What should I search on my computer?  It's the same one I used to opent he blockchain account in august of 2014 which is when I made the transfer from localbitcoins.com
Is there anything I should be searching for specifically?  If so can you give me the querry?
brute force wont work, I tried it already ... And the weirdest part is when the site was responding to my emails over a year ago, they said the wallet was never logged into aside from day it was created ... 
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:49:48
I don't know wht this means.  I use a mac, do i type this into the terminal?
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:48:22
No. 
I sent from lbc to somewhere.  
That 'somewhere' I thought for the last 4 years was a blockchain wallet that I didn't have the password for.  I finally got into that wallet with brute force and there was nothing there.  
So now the only thing I have going for me is the fact that I know 100% that I generated the public address somehow, and the fact that I still have the original computer.
Thats it

@_date: 2019-06-21 20:50:46
Agreed, which is why the only possible answer I could stumble upon is one that has me searching my computer hard drive properly ... something I don't know how to do using the terminal
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:45:02
Im just copy pasting so i cant be mistyping anything.  I just started from the top again.  then opened a new window and did tail -f /tmp/hopeful and nothing happened
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:50:02
There was a lot of "is a directory" but am i looking for the word warnings?
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:21:32
Is it possible that its already done searching, looks like it did -bash: .... and then one line lower it has the same thing it had before I entered grep -1 etc.... but its only been like 3 minutes?
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:58:51
So here is what I did step by step.
1) I entered this with my key     
for f in `find /`; do grep -l yourKeyGoesHere $f; done &gt; /tmp/hopeful
This produced a series of "grep: ........."
2) I then opened a new window and entered 
cat /tmp/hope* 
and nothing happened at all.
I dont necessarily know what Im looking for at this point so any guidance would be awesome.
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:53:06
Thank you.  THe fact that I never installed it means it's probably not the answer I'm looking for ... How would I run a script/command to examine every file on teh hard drive for the public keY?
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:03:49
by the way both of those videos were removed from youtube apparently
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:19:04
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:29:56
Ok i entered it in a new window and nothing is happening.  Should I start the whole thing all over again?
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:59:50
Yes I still have my mac desktop.  What's strange tho is that when I go to my localbitcoin account, 2014 is too far back so I cant see the transaction but I remember it being there clearly in August of 2014 and even a couple years later when I tried tracking it down ... However in searching the local bitcoin account I don't see there being a "receiving address 1mgsoj .." So what the hell does that even mean since the localbitcoin account is 100% where the coins were sent from. 
Thank you for your help everyone.
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:00:34
Sorry i got excited cause i saw a multibit icon and assumed i had downloaded it but now am back to square 1 seemingly ... would love to search my comp for the public key, is the terminal search going to populate items that a search in the top rigth corner wouldn't?
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:34:54
Dont see any warnings/ . Just a bunch of permission denied.  Then "not a directory" then the "argument list too long" then back to the prompt
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:43:50
This multibit download a few months before I sent the coin is intriguing, but it looks like i never installed it.  All i have is a download and a readme txt file.  very strange
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:38:53
Ok love that idea.  Mac.  Don't know how to do that sadly ... also just found out I had a Multibit.dmg file from April 2014 on that computer ... perhaps a lead in the case .... Any suggestions?  How would I do what you are suggesting with the command script
@_date: 2019-05-22 00:50:51
I did this.  Now what?
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:17:24
Awesome.  It's running now.  I know you will never know, but I swear on everything that means anything to me, if I find it somewhere on this computer I will send you $1000 in btc.  
Do I have to sit here and allow it access to things everytime it prompts?  Also, if I am going to sit here and sweat it out, is there anything that would suggest good news as I watch the scripts run?  Or will I not know until i run the second script?
@_date: 2019-05-28 23:18:32
Apparently I never installed it.  I looked for it but couldn't find it anywhere other then as a DMG file.  Called Multibit.
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:20:03
So if I had a paper wallet, how might i have generated that public address, which i wrote down and kept in a safe like an idiot thinking it was my public key ... (I had no idea what i was doing back then)
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:23:48


I just typed that in and hit enter and nothing happened
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:43:08
what do you mean if i know the password?  what password?
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:49:02
Ok so this produced more results in the terminal, I am digging through to see if I find any warnings but what is the next step again?
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:33:09
What does this even mean.  This is the wallet that i could've sworn I sent it to because I created it the same day the coins were sent.  Why would they be non-spendable?
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:33:55
So it's done running, what do i look for now?
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:17:53
Make it $2000, this would be an epic find
