Wire transfers are possible from Wells Fargo, from a savings account, to a foreign account, without going to a branch. It's pretty standard operating procedure. 
[Here is even the form]( you would have filled out and faxed, scanned and emailed, or sent by mail to WF for them to initiate the transfer.
This is pretty standard for most banks, and even the smallest of the small banks. It just seems like the person you talked to, had no clue what they were doing. Having no clue about how to do things, is also standard procedure for customer service at banks.

Kind of like responsible credit card usage, only on a shorter time frame. Instead of waiting to pay interest, cover your debts so you don't owe money. This would be like buying back in so you don't lose profits.

With currency trading it doesn't matter how long you hold them, as gains and loses will be both taxes as short and long term gains.
The thing is, crypto isn't really an equity, and hasn't really been established as a currency, so it's hard to know what the government wants it taxed as unless they tell us.
Personally, last year I just figured out what taxes will be as an equity, and a currency, and just paid what was higher to be safe. I'll most likely do the same again this year.

Yeah, Morgan was a dick. But, even before Chase acquired/merged with JP Morgan in the late 90s, Chase Manhattan came from a acquisition/merger of Chase National Bank, and the Manhattan Co., which Burr founded.
To be honest, they weren't so bad as Chase Manhattan, but as soon as the JP Morgan deal started to go through, they became this horrible cess-pool of shittiness.

We need this more than anything. Most of us want to play by the rules, but we need some actually clarity on what rules we need to follow.

Hey OP. I'm VP of a rinky dink investment department on the other side of the state. Over the past few months I've gotten quite a few higher ups to buy some bitcoin, and we have no policy like this other than what federal guidelines dictate.
While I personally loathe banks and don't want to advise you to do business with them anymore; If things don't work out for you locally, hit me up, and I'll see what I can do for you.

Regulations suck, and are expensive.

We really need to know if they are going to keep worrying about if Bitcoin is going to be legal, or illegal, and just tell us it's a currency already so we can play by the rules at hand. 
Especially on the tax side, if we're treating it in this limbo status, there is nothing stopping us from treating gains as an investment, not as a currency, and since people have been doing this both ways, that either leaves some people out of a lot of money, or the government is out.

Hey, me too, back in the Chase Manhattan days.


And what banking culture isn't? That's exactly what banking culture is.


What guy is that? Because the current Chase bank was formed by mergers/acquisitions over many different companies over the past 150+ years.
Technically the oldest part of Chase goes back to 18th century with Aaron Burr, you know, the man who shot Alexander Hamilton. (the man who created political parties, the National Bank (Which went on to create the federal reserve), levied unfair taxes, and got is so much in bed with the British that we just gained our independence from, that they thought we wanted to be British again, so they came and burned down our capital.)
If anything, Chase Bank has roots going back to the man who loathed the federal monopoly on banking, and government intervention of monetary policy so much that he started up his own damned bank (unfortunately without hookers or blackjack) while giving the federal government a big middle finger. That man loathed the system so much, that he actually shot, and killed, the person who created the federal banking problems that bitcoin is trying to free it's self from over 200 years later.
But yes, Chase fell far from the roots of what created to it, and is firmly in bed with big government now.

He's on the moon currently, we still need to build the inferstructure to communicate easily with him.

TYL that most firefighters in the US are volunteer. ~75% of firefighters receive no compensation for performing their duties, and money is donated to them in various ways to purchase equipment.
We can do that with police as well. There were several volunteer police forces in this country, with the last one being shutdown a few years ago because the actual paid police lobbied against them because they weren't getting overtime because of them. This last group of holdouts did everything from traffic control, to providing their services to the president. In the 130+ years that the last group was around, they only shot one person.
So yes, voluntary contributions are sufficient to provide fire, and possibly police protection to most of the country.

I just want to know what they want me to report as. Am I reporting as long/short term gains/loses whereas they let me take specific lots and assign them a tax basis and am taxed like trading I am trading a "stock", or are do they want to tax me as a currency trader doing 60/40 long/short term gains.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:23:01
If it is treated as a currency that is not how you realize gains/loses, and that could lead to a lot of problems when you're not paying enough taxes.

As a CFA, and a CPA, I still don't know what the government expects of us.
Over the past few years it was easy to just report meager earnings at the highest capital gains and be safe, but now with the amount of of people cashing out big earnings, this is something that I think needs clarified so we can follow the rules already in place.
A lot of time I think people talk about regulating bitcoins as something completely new, and as they try to categorize it as something completely radical, but they fail to realize that there are already rules in place, and we just need to know what rules they want us to follow.
The rules have already kind of been set on the "retail" side with the money transmitter stuff, but on the investment side I'd really like to know if they are going to regulate it as a currency or as a security.

Now that could be a problem, it could lead to people either overpaying the government, or extremely underpaying. 
It's not too big of a difference on a couple of hundred dollar gains, but now when we are seeing gains in the tens of thousands, and even millions, it could be the difference of being out a lot of money, or in jail.
