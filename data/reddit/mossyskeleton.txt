Finally. See, I've been waiting for something like this ever since fucking NAPSTER was shut down. It's about time. It only makes sense.

Typo in the wallet address?..

Bitcoin likes to occasionally do 30-40% drops in a bull market. This puts it between $8500-9250 off of its most recent high.
I'd wait... but don't wait for $8500.
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:38:13
I sold everything in a bold attempt at a swing trade to increase my BTC... aiming to buy back in at &lt;$9k.
I don't do this often. Hope I don't get rekt. Wish me luck!
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:12:07
I've been trying to swing trade to grow my BTC.
I'm not very good at it.
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:03:56
Yeah there will be another 30-40% retracement... after we hit like $16k. So you may as well just buy now.
The latest dip is officially over.
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:00:58
Nice. I was going to at $9300 but thought it was going to go lower... :/
@_date: 2019-07-16 01:04:39
Eh. I'm net positive in dollars on crypto after five years of immersing in it.
If I lose some tenths of bitcoins in a bull market I'll be okay.
I'm gonna ride this for a few weeks though. I do believe there's still plenty of room for a continued downtrend. I may not hit $9k but I bet I can get close to $9.5k.
@_date: 2015-12-23 22:08:25
When is the halving occurring? (Or has it already happened?.. I haven't been following for a while....)
@_date: 2015-12-11 00:25:30
Probably an experiment of some three-lettered organization.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:28:38
Except for the fact that (according to this article-- which is what you're basing your assumption on as well) he is clearly anti-government.
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:19:06
I *have* been looking into it for a long time. 
I just want to hear some of your opinions..... not your snark. 
If you don't like my question, downvote and move on. I'm just trying to have a conversation. If you've heard it a million times before, then don't engage.
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:36:26
I'm in a weird position where I'm comfortable losing $1,000 to playing with bitcoins, in hopes of making some money off of it over time.
I also believe in the bitcoin dream, too. I love technology and freedom.
But I also like gaining resource credits-- i.e. money.
My point is I won't complain. I'll try not to at least. If there's anything to complain about it's how friggin impossible it is to gain some semblance of comprehension of what the fuck is going on with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:09:59
Have you been watching?... It's actually been very informative so far.
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:16:29
Thank you for an informative (and not derogatory) answer. I realize bitcoin is speculative, but there are aspects of it (like your comment) that are known that can contribute to making informed decisions about playing with bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:24:51
How do you day trade bitcoins? Are there sites that are more recommended for this sort of thing? I know mtgox has been around for a while, but I've come across people saying that it's falling behind as an optimal resource? .. Are there any highly recommended sites or methods for doing this?
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:51:39

It's scary what the Feds can do if they want to.
I wonder what they say to these people to get them to shut down their services. What is backing up the gag orders? I don't really want to know. My guess?.. some fucked up blackmail &amp; bribery. I bet it's pretty dark.
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:35:00
This sounds fun. Might be a good introduction into stock market stuff, too. :P

*edit: Here's the link!
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:25:46
Cognitive dissonance. Many bitcoin folks want Satoshi to remain an enigma. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:23:48
I'm curious: how are you planning to buy the Silk Road coins when they're released for sale? Is there some kind of secret sign-up sheet somewhere or something?

...unless he's hiding in plain sight....
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:41:04
I laughed but I'm not going to upvote you. :P
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:31:45
Thanks. I'll look into these.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:44:00
I'm happy that this type of information is available to us.. but it doesn't make me any more comfortable, that's for sure.
The more transparency the better.
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:07:10
Thanks I needed that.
Sounds like a plan.
@_date: 2014-10-10 06:15:03
Don't apologize! I thought it was funny and witty. I'd rather hear a cheap joke than see a blank stare. He pulled it off.
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:35:53
Hahaha could you imagine if he is Satoshi *and* DPR?
I mean, the guy does seem to have a fascination with Japanese culture and stuff... and the name Satoshi Nakamoto..... 
It would seriously be the best thing ever.
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:50:22
Who says I haven't? I'm asking this guy, OP. Not you.
@_date: 2015-01-16 07:00:15
Maybe an evil idiot savant?
@_date: 2015-01-15 06:19:34
That wasn't what I asked, Mr. Not-OP.
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:49:02
Edit: Dear OP:
Convince me why I should also invest money I can afford to lose in bitcoin right now.
(I just want to hear your reasoning. Careful research? A convincing argument? A gut instinct? Pretty please.)
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:53:52
That's a silly website and I like it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:35:39
Worth noting. Any elite hackers out there using biohazard signs on message boards or something?..
@_date: 2015-05-13 01:36:09
I was just thinking about this recently-- early adopter programmers who sneak Bitcoin's blockchain into software that they create in order to make it essential for things to work.
Then profit.
@_date: 2016-06-22 01:32:31
that.... would be ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-11-17 03:34:45
Your next bet is when it hits around $6,000 again. (That's prob the lowest it will go before the next big bull run)...
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:08:57
OP can you link where you found that Uncle Sam / Eye of Providence / Lizard Person / Alien image? I really want a bigger version of that...
(tried GIS to no avail-- only a link to a Flat Earth YouTube video haha)
@_date: 2019-10-19 05:50:49
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:46:15
Cash out half of that. Buy back in after the inevitable crash that is coming. If you know Bitcoin, you know it's going to go down again, hard, at some point soon enough.. before it continues to climb.
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:52:47
Could you imagine if this guy was the real Satoshi? That would be even more crazy than if it were Craig.
@_date: 2019-04-27 00:32:33
I bet this is Panama Papers fallout. 
I have no reason to assume this other than the fact that Crypto Capital is based in Panama and that we're talking about very large sums of money.

[The Bitcoin Standard](
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:43:05


Unless Satoshi is still alive and has the keys for all of the coins that they own... and decides to do something with them.
I find it kinda weird that nobody considers this within the realm of possibility. A lot of Bitcoin maximalists tend to just assume this could never happen.
@_date: 2019-04-27 01:49:34
Prob could. But IOTA is a non-blockchain cryptocurrency though. It's based on something called "the Tangle"... it's a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Could offer some alternative scaling solutions, quantum resistance, etc.
@_date: 2019-04-27 00:26:37
Well it *is* Germany. IOTA is based in Germany.
@_date: 2019-04-27 01:42:01
I should have said initially developed in Germany... but yeah also I guess they're still working on their centralization issues though..
Of all the shitcoins out there, IOTA is at least doing things. They're worth keeping an eye on. If they pull off what they're aiming to do they'll be around for a while. But they might be too future-leaning... we don't exactly yet have an Internet of Things that is ready to automate transactions among the non-human entities within it.
(I don't own any.. I used to..)
It's mostly just crypto-futurism fap material at the moment.
@_date: 2016-09-10 18:03:10
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:48:26
Yeah I'm waiting to see if this is a bear trap... I'm considering trying to swing trade a potential dip down to ~$7k.. but I'm not convinced that that's a good idea quite yet.
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:32:46
I hope that some day we get to find out who he is... some day far in the future, sure.. but it'd be pretty cool to have that information.
Probably a group of people right?..
@_date: 2015-04-19 07:57:16


OMG so 4 realz
@_date: 2015-04-06 03:41:33
So do all of us geeks like the same stuff? Joe Rogan, Duncan Trussell, Bitcoin, Andreas Antonopoulis, psychedelics, reddit....
..are we The Borg? What is it like hanging out with you people in person? (....I bet it's weird.) Is it fun? Where do we all hang out? None of my real life friends are into this stuff.
@_date: 2019-09-02 05:13:58
If you look at prior halvings they happen in the middle of a flatland price-wise... it takes some time to get to the ascension from it.. 
It'll be a slow rise....
@_date: 2015-03-19 05:27:53
Delete that part about OD'ing and I agree with you. Otherwise, fuck *you*.
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:29:23
I don't believe it's at all in the realm of reasonable likelihood... but if you consider that one of the main potentials of crypto is to "bank the unbanked" ... maybe there's an iota of a possibility there.
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:30:19
No. Because I had to exchange all of my fucking Bitcoins for American dollars in September! Due to minor financial difficulties! Because I should totally sell my Bitcoins instead of the shit I don't use! Right?!
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:59:34
What does that mean?
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:45:59
So what you're telling me is that all I need to do is figure out which altcoins are being used the most as an actual currency and then.. stockpile them and become rich.
Got it.

You can't click through a few links in this subreddit that are currently on the front page of this subreddit which explain pretty much everything?

Is Kim Dotcom playing with FruityLoops again?
@_date: 2016-10-10 01:15:57
Bitcoin / cryptocurrencies / the blockchain allow for quick, fluid micro-transactions (payments in very small amounts) that would be a likely intrinsic aspect of the future of the "Internet of things".
I recommend checking out interviews with Andreas Antonopoulos if you're intrigued.
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:44:01
I'm not sure if this is just a case of my rationality being distorted by a pretty graph that looks like it represents an actual trend (yet is just a simple, meaningless attempt at making order out of chaos) or if.. you know.. it's actually reflective of a real usable pattern.. in which case I should probably put some more dollars into Bitcoin.
I guess there's only one way to find out, right?....
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:29:37
The counter point is essentially this: 
1) the more you travel, the more you experience, 
2) the more you experience, the more you discover about the world and face the realization that you don't know everything, 
3) the more you realize that you don't know everything, the more you realize that your knowledge is insignificant compared to the vast infinite unknowns of the world.
In other words: there is always more to be learned. 
In other other words: you don't know shit and neither do I.
(But you can still travel. So that part of your quote remains..)
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:05:38
Not necessarily advertisement. Sometimes people like to share things they find interesting. Sometimes they try to write things up in a way that makes it sound appealing to other people. I know this because I've done this on reddit before and have been accused of the same thing. Not everyone is out to get you and your money.
Also, if it is an advertisement they missed a key feature: you can also buy bitcoins using this service. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:25:26
Is this any good? Worth watching?
@_date: 2016-05-02 21:36:39
Maybe the NDA he signed was actually procured by some shadowy three-lettered government agency....
the problem with this whole thing is that bitcoin, by nature (at its current stage), mainly draws the type of people who are eager and prone to get absorbed in consipiracy type thinking.
Not exactly a problem, but it makes sorting things out rather difficult.
@_date: 2015-03-04 02:16:29
Well I just started downloading it.. 1.3 GB.. I'll let you know in two hours if it worked. :P

What does his flashy egomaniacal personality have to do with his business sense? Some of the most successful people in the world are flashy egomaniacs.
I might be in the minority here, but I'm glad these people exist. We need some living cartoon characters in the world. It makes life more interesting.
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:06:22
It does... but to be fair, sometimes people are just good writers.
@_date: 2015-02-23 03:03:53
Whether or not this is a ridiculous number, I just bought another Bitcoin.. just in case.
(I just want to buy a house and land some day with the Bitcoins I'll pay for at less than $500 each. That's all I'm really hoping for. It's starting to sound like less and less of a pipe dream if even some of the more conservative value predictions come true...)
@_date: 2015-02-28 06:01:32
lol this would be among the last contexts I would expect to hear some [Sister Nancy]( but I'll take it. 
Bitcoin history meets a classic proto-dancehall track. Who would have thought? 
I guess this is what living in the future is like.

What are you even basing this cartoonish representation of Libertarians on?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:43:39
From what I could gather, though, he cashed out only what he put in and left the rest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:07:13
Well, I will be honest and say I *am* hoping to gain some money quickly by doing this. (I am deliberately intending to ride the bubble.) WITH THAT SAID, though, I'm intending to hang on to at least half of the bitcoins I make (which will hopefully be a decent amount) and use them as currency. 
I love the idea of the bitcoin and I BELIEVE IN IT! I want to be a part of it. 
So I'm asking myself: why not join now and make some money while I'm at it?
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:40:45


whyyyyyy have I not thought of this? thanks. good idea.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:04:26
Yeah I saw that. I'd currently have to wait until Friday. The main reason I was looking at coinbase was because my bank account is already verified through them so I don't have to wait for that to happen. Do you have any suggestions for a better way to do it?..
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:31:28
I do like this idea, and will seriously consider taking this plan of action. I guarantee I *will* "cash out" to some degree, but I would also love to engage in this market as it is intended. 
I'm just trying not to put all my eggs in one basket, so to speak. I see a risk/reward scenario here, and I'm going to go for it. That doesn't mean I'm going to just take all the USD and run, though. Like I said, I really love the concept and practice of the bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:27:50
Yes, I do: Which service should I use to go to CVS or WalMart, cash in hand, tomorrow, and have bitcoins in a wallet by the end of the week? I'm starting with no accounts created anywhere.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:42:18
I find it interesting that cultures emerge in subreddits where people feel like they must conform to a group mentality and express opinions that cater to the agreements of the whole. Why should the entire subreddit take responsibility for individuals' decisions based on the content of this subreddit? Why must there be a consensus? 
I do agree that the rational skeptical posts should be available on the front page of the subreddit, though......
I just think it's interesting how we regulate the atmosphere and content of subreddits.. It's a normal and fair thing to want to do.. I just find it interesting.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:13:07
Let's say I have... $2500 I could afford to lose...
Should I be buying some bitcoins?..
I've been looking into bitcoins for a while now.. I have my bank account linked as of a few months ago (to coinbase) but I haven't bought any yet. I'm really starting to think I should drop that money into some bitcoins and see what happens this summer.............. looking for **any** advice.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:31:02
Do you need an account at mt gox in order to get the bitcoins? Or is there a way to get a bitcoin address quickly? 
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:32:37
Smart. Thanks for the advice.
