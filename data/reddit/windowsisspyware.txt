It's not really, it's a centralized service that is already responding to court orders: 
Something like Protonmail that you could host yourself would be 100x better. Except Protonmail isn't really interested in that, it seems they are here to sell and own a product.

Its transaction fees are too high and it has no privacy features that would make it appropriate for day to day spending... Why would i want my personal finances known to my driver because i chose BTC? Why would i want him and his company to follow my future transactions forever? Uber is already a privacy nightmare without adding bitcoin. Bitcoin frankly sucks as a regular payment method, it's obviously more on an investor item right now.
(Disclaimer, i hold Bitcoin.)

It's not awesome because it exists and is being approached by the government for user data.
If you're going to have an email server it's obviously better because you're the only one using it, instead of being forced to share a service with thousands of undesirable people.


You can't host your own Protonmail server! because Protonmail is centralized and there are practically no instructions anywhere on running your own. How can Protonmail charge you ~$6 a month if you could easily host your own version of it? They can't and they know this, they are just here to make money off you it seems.

If it's high and you say HODL doesn't that mean you're really telling people to sell now? We should just be saying 'HO HO HO'!

I'm looking at this vs a Trezor, but Trezor seems a little better simply because they have an FDroid repo.
What are some other differences i should care about?

Cuck-card vendor states the obvious.

Would still be 100x better if it was my server with closed registry and there was no bomb threating, email scamming, terrorist, pedo whatever to share the server with! ;)
Protonmail knows it can't make any money off you if they let you easily host your own. They are just another company trying to cage you up in their service and milk you for $$$.

Why would you even compare them? They are so different this makes me cringe.
One is private and can't be sent online and won't reveal the total sum your life savings to the pizza guy (who later rolls you), or any of your previous financial history.
The other is a surveillance machine we all call Bitcoin. (except for those trolls in that other sub i won't even mention.) Bitcoin is global and digital but it suffers from a extreme lack of privacy. The irony here is that the BTC you receive may not actually be 'clean' and could get you in a lot of trouble. (due to Bitcoin being so traceable, and people being so nasty) :)
