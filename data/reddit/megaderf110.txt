20k smaller states constantly in war with each other?

This idea that banks make money out of thin air is wrong and makes no sense.
Also, this post seems to ignore the difference between central banks and the other banks.

Do you really think that this would be a good reason to? Seriously?

It's only getting stronger in the last year. So strong that Mario Draghi is slightly worried because it could cause problems with exports.

If you want to be in the EU, you need to follow certain rules. If you didn't want to follow them, you could have simply not have joined it in the first place.

That makes no sense whatsoever. Let's pretend for a second that a world with so many little states would be sustainable and stable. How can you even think that everyone in there would have the money and the resources to move somewhere else on the planet and leave their jobs, family and friends because they don't like a single law of their current country? Why would they even be accepted in this new state? And how is this any different than today's world and immigration, other than the fact that there is not as much variety as there would be in this imaginary world?

I found this subreddit just because I was trying to understand better what the fork meant, and I went to r/btc too. The only thing I found there was propaganda and people too full of themselves.
