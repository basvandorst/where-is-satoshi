OP is suggesting they would mooch off lightening and pocket the fees
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:15:02
if merchants really cared, they'd "CPFP spend" our unconfirmed payments and we'd only need to pay enough to broadcast. they're going to pay the fee to move our payments anyway, right?
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:15:15
ok well you can set a manual change address in the GUI by enabling coin control features.

perhaps premature, but preparing for the final block reward might not be so bad. I wasn't aware of inefficiencies of spending unconfirmed transactions tho.

yeah I second this. I had a really dumb issue where I sent them a .45 btc payment channel tx when I thought it was going to me. Real stand up guys who resolved it like it was actually a priority to them, when they could have just kept it.
And one other time where I actually forgot a 5 digit pin, idiotically blamed it on an update, so they wrote a recovery tool APK and massively improved the workflow for forgotten pin attempts.

@_date: 2018-01-03 21:45:02
the fact that you didn't mine bitcoin when they were free in 2009 because you thought the government would squash it, or thought it was fake money, or maybe weren't even born yet, does not make it premined. The code has not changed without consensus since the genesis block. Satoshi, Hal, Szabo many others contributed real resources via mining because of a passion they believed in. The whitepaper was sent out via distribution list. There is literal no way to spin Bitcoin as a premine.

@_date: 2018-01-08 00:28:15
OK. You see the unconfirmed "change" bitcoins in the wallet, right? If you send them to yourself with a higher fee it should act as "Child Pays for Parent" and confirm both of them. The longer alternative would be to download the bitcoinQT wallet, import the private key from blockchain.info and double spend that with a higher fee.

you could get them confirmed more cheaply by spending the unconfirmed money to yourself with a higher network fee. Accelerators (and bcash) are a scam.

actually, i'm not sure if its because I'm running a core node - but I sent transactions with this same fee level over a month ago, and they are being continuously rebroadcast. When I pull up the info, it says I sent them today. I know I can abandon and re-send them, but I am not in a hurry.

@_date: 2018-01-08 01:02:23
no, if you send yourself the change from the transaction you posted it will deduct another (higher value) transaction fee to hopefully confirm the parent and child transactions faster. Otherwise it would the transaction will eventually get dropped as if it never happened, but I have some that have been hanging around since mid December.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:24:15
you could have paid half that, being a segwit tx.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:07:28
1) use segwit from now on
2) spend the change output with a higher fee to confirm the parent

I have a friend who basically put all of his money into BTC last month because he's so lazy he doesn't work any more. it's lost 15%, and I'm fairly certain he'll be forced to sell at the worst possible price.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:32:30
~30 sat/byte fees will never confirm, they'll either get rebroadcast for eternity or go back to their origin. You could spend the unconfirmed transactions with a higher fee in order to confirm them. 150 sat/byte fee will take approx one week to confirm.

@_date: 2017-12-21 21:29:31
Bitcoin can always gain block weight, but it can never recover, imho, if we move too fast and break anything. Unfortunately the software isn't ready for mainstream use yet and obviously the sticking point that many disagree on is whether we should use a "band-aid". There's absolutely nothing wrong with people utilizing other coins for whatever business they need to conduct in the interim - in fact, I would expect it. But if we don't scale it right, or break something, I don't know that we can never go back.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:04:24

@_date: 2017-12-21 20:39:59
are you using the segwit chain on your ledger nano? It wouldn't hurt to send yourself a transaction to combine everything, but its not worth paying $15+ plus to do it. Try setting a low custom fee if you don't plan on moving them in the next 7 or so days.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:21:03

I just don't understand the problem then. all of the concern trolling (basically every post in r/bitcoin/new) isn't going to do anything productive in my opinion. Just beating a dead horse.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:15:05
I know, but it doesn't make sense from a business perspective. I predict it will either stop functioning that way, or is indicative of nefarious motivations. When I found out about the GDAX trick, I was was already logged into Coinbase and just opened a new Gdax tab which loaded right to the trading screen. Its so easy, that it makes me wonder why they stopped paying fees on the coinbase.com side.  It just doesn't make sense.

I think the majority of people with BTC want to scale it properly, and not just kick the can down the road with block size increases. Scaling isn't going to be easy, but I don't know that any alternative coin is closer to solving it than BTC is.

yup. or you can do dollar-cost averaging.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:39:46
I haven't tried but if the wallet is looking/scanning for it, AFAIK it is safe. Not a good user experience (coins could appear lost) which is why I do not believe Core has enabled bech32 yet. Samourai handles this well from what I have read, unfortunately mobile only tho.
fun fact: you can withdraw from GDAX to bech32 address.

fuck you @_date: 2017-12-14 17:06:15
Ok, then segwit...but they're going to add bcash functionality before they enable segwit. I'd place a bet on it. They know that we all deposit to GDAX and send for free that way - so they either: 
1) don't care
2) are preparing to weaponize fees comparisons with bcash when they launch it
3) are epically stupid.
Custom fees could be under an advanced tab. They could let us export private keys to move them with our own wallets. Instead, they force a severely over-estimated network fee which in actually is only making the problem worse for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:13:15
they sell killings on openbazaar I think
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:56:52
Kinda seems like it, given what he said in the times article I posted below the email I just sent them.
"you either need to allow us to set custom fees, or enable segwit. Holding us hostage because we **"broke your heart a little bit"** is disgusting and you should be ashamed. 
enable segwit now"

@_date: 2017-12-19 00:51:56
no problem! I just exported my private keys from bitcoin-qt and pasted them into the coinomi app on my phone - changelly built right in. There's some minimums right now (~.3-.5 BTG depending on the alt you want). I went with ETH, send it to GDAX/Coinbase, sold for USD, and purchased BTC. If you have trouble, PM me because I found one more wallet I didnt do and we could probably work out a private exchange if you need (bonus points if you have a segwit wallet)
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:12:49
this is unacceptable and I guarantee you will be weaponized by the bcash big blockers. Demand coinbase let us set a custom fee.

no problem. "Core" is the Bitcoin reference wallet. "Cash" is an alt-coin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:32:26
no. it is far better to send as many dust transactions to an external wallet as you can. I figure they lose ~50 a pop that way.

it can hang around for 7 days or more until it gets dropped, and then it is like the transaction never happened - your coins would be spendable again.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:32:15
Gemini halted BTC withdrawls anyway, "due to a delay in block mining on the Bitcoin Network". Deposit the money from coinbase to gdax and load up your paper wallets for no network fee. That's what i've been doing today as well.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:09:46
well they'd save alot of money from EVERYONE depositing to GDAX and sending from there for free.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:15:07
so what I do is open bitcoin-qt.exe -walletbroadcast=0
then you may be able to right click on the transaction in core and select "Abandon Transaction". Enable coin control options in the wallet settings, select the coin you want to double spend and make a new transaction. Then if you need to you can right click on the new double-spent transaction to get the raw transaction data and push it using 
This is off the top of my head and I may have missed a step or two so let me know if you have difficulties with this. It also may be dependent on you having selected "Opt in replace by fee" when you sent the transaction. I'm not really sure about that tho.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:21:29

I think as long as the inputs and outputs are the same, with the exception of the fee (and less change) then it gets accepted by the network. This transaction is one I did, you see the first one with the low fee is pending and will never be confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:10:31
immediately, if it uses the exact same input(s) and output(s), only with a higher fee.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:13:57

UPDATE, 4:12PM: Butterfly Labs has released a statement:
Butterfly Labs is disappointed in the heavy-handed actions of the Federal Trade Commission. In a rush to judgment, the FTC has acted as judge, jury and executioner, contrary to our intended system of governmental checks and balances. The FTC's current actions are negatively impacting our thousands of customers and our dozens of employees. Their current media campaign should only further alarm a knowing citizenry and raise questions as to why the FTC wouldn't simply let this case play out through the judicial system. That is what Butterfly Labs intends to do.
It appears the FTC has decided to go to war on bitcoin overall, and is starting with Butterfly Labs. Butterfly Labs is being portrayed by the FTC as a bogus and fake company. To the contrary, Butterfly Labs is very real. As pointed out in court filings Butterfly Labs made last night, Butterfly Labs has shipped more than $33 million in products to customers and voluntarily granted refunds approximating $17 million to customers for cancelled orders. Butterfly Labs was literally is in the midst of shipping out completed products to fulfill the remaining millions of dollars of orders on our books and issuing requested refunds, when the FTC effectively closed the doors of Butterfly Labs without any chance to be heard in court.
At this time, Butterfly Labs is cooperating fully with the Temporary Receiver appointed by the Court. A hearing is set for September 29 and Butterfly Labs has asked the Court to allow it to present testimony from key witnesses for the company. Butterfly Labs intends to defend our business and our nascent and promising industry. The government wants to shut Butterfly Labs down, and we are not going away without a fight to vindicate bitcoin, our company, and our employees. Our continued focus is our customers and finding a way to continue to deliver products and processing refunds for those who have requested them.

the coins will only sell for a price that someone is willing to sell it for. Clearly, Gox is not on the same page as the real world (and never has been).
edit to add: all people are doing at this point is betting that gox will enable btc withdrawls *ever*. If they do, the price on Gox will adjust accordingly to the other exchange rates I would think. If not give them a boost.

Obviously, for a few bucks it is irrelevant in either case.

eh, im typically skeptical about insurance but if I were concerned and non-technical I would seek a place that would guarantee my coins similarly to FDIC.
I think it depends on how (frequently) one uses bitcoin, honestly. I wouldn't trust coinbase to churn out an actual tx in a timely fasion if I were out at a restaurant, and as such would want a portion my coins readily accessible.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
I am sweating as I write this.
Christmas brought grave news. I cannot adequately express how deeply honored I was by your unconditional support of my staff.
I do not expect the same reaction to today's revelations. This movement is built on integrity, and I feel obligated to be forthright with you.
I held myself to a high standard as your leader, yet now I must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community:
We have been hacked.
Nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.
Our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.
Despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the Bitcoin protocol itself.
This attack hit us at the worst possible time. We were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and Dispute Center this past weekend, and our projections of order finalization volume indicated that we would need the community's full balance in hot storage.
In retrospect this was incredibly foolish, and I take full responsibility for this decision.
I have failed you as a leader, and am completely devastated by today's discoveries. I should have taken MtGox and Bitstamp's lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. I was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand. It is a crushing blow. I cannot find the words to express how deeply I want this movement to be safe from the very threats I just watched materialize during my watch.
I've included transaction logs at the bottom of this message. Review the vendor's dishonest actions and use whatever means you deem necessary to bring this person to justice. More details will emerge as we continue to investigate.
Given the right flavor of influence from our community, we can only hope that he will decide to return the coins with integrity as opposed to hiding like a coward.
It takes the integrity of all of us to push this movement forward. Whoever you are, you still have a chance to act in the interest of helping this community. Keep a percentage, return the rest. Don't walk away with your fellow freedom fighters' coins. DPR2 returned the cold storage. I didn't run with the gold. But two people alone cannot move us forward. It takes an entire community committing to integrity - and though this crushing blow will not stop us, it sure is a testament to how greedy some bastards truly are.
Being a part of this movement might be the most defining thing you do with your entire life.
Don't trade that for greed, comrades.
I will fight here by your side, even the greedy bastards amongst us.
This community has suffered great financial loss over and over again, and I am devastated that it has happened again under my watch.
Hindsight is already suggesting dozens of ways this could have been prevented, but we must march onward.
The only way to reverse a community's greed is through generosity. Our true character is revealed during trying times.
If this financial hardship places you at risk of physical harm, contact me directly and I will do my best to help you with my remaining personal funds.
- ----------------
Now what.
- ----------------
Never again store your escrow bitcoins on a server.
Silk Road will never again be a centralized escrow storage.
This week has shown the collateral damage we can cause by being a huge target and failing in just one unforeseen area.
I am now fully convinced that no hosted escrow service is safe.
If I cannot trust myself to keep a hosted escrow solution safe, I cannot trust anyone.
Multi-signature transactions are the only way this community will be protected long-term.
I am aggressively tasking our devs on building out multi-sig support for commonly-used bitcoin clients. Expect a generous bounty if you have the skill to implement this.
- -----------------
Until then.
- -----------------
1. We will never again allow ourselves to be a single point of failure. We will never again host your Escrow wallets.
2. Vendor registration is closed while we regroup.
3. All listings on Silk Road are now No-Escrow (Finalize-Early) for 1-2 months while we implement multi-signature transactions and lobby for mainstream Bitcoin client multi-sig support.
4. All unshipped orders have been cancelled.
5. Vendors may link to other marketplaces on a trail basis until we launch multi-sig, then we will re-evaluate based on community input. We do not want to be a centralized point of failure, but we also do not want to lead our buyers into dangerous waters.
6. From this point forward DO NOT trust markets with centralized escrow. Use multi-signature transactions whenever possible, with trusted third parties as escrow providers.
Everything will be offline for 24-48 hours to minimize variables as we continue to investigate. The evidence we have below will be expanded based on our findings.
- ------------------
No marketplace is perfect. Expect any centralized market to fail at some point. This is precisely why we must unite in the decision to decentralize.
We are relieved that our security procedures protected user identities, and that no servers were compromised. This was not a worst-case scenario: nobody will be getting arrested from this. Financial loss is terrible, but will not put all of us behind bars.
The details we have on the hacker are below. Stop at nothing to bring this person to your own definition of justice.
Humbled and furious,
- ------------------

What does this mean?
blockchain.info normally uses encryption (SSL) to protect your information. When Chrome tried to connect to blockchain.info this time, blockchain.info returned unusual and incorrect credentials. Either an attacker is trying to pretend to be blockchain.info, or a Wi-Fi sign-in screen has interrupted the connection. Your information is still secure because Chrome stopped the connection before any data was exchanged.
Network errors and attacks are usually temporary, so this page will probably work later. You can also try switching to another network.
Technical details
blockchain.info has asked Chrome to block any certificates with errors, but the certificate that Chrome received during this connection attempt has an error.

My biggest concern was counterfeit bills. Was going to get a pen for my transactions, but then coinbase lowered the instant buy limit prohibitively.

If I tumbled my coins for personal privacy, and received stolen coins, I would be very upset if their fungibility was impaired. Aside from NOT mixing, there's nothing I can do to prevent that -- and I don't feel the burden should fall on me to monitor taint analysis when it doesnt even work half the time on BC.info and they are the only ones who have a public system of the sorts.
Hypothetical: I mix coins, get stolen coins (one time I received "FlexCoin Stolen Coins" -- never even heard of it), proceed to spend said coins at Bitstamp. What can Bitstamp accomplish? This is an actual scenario I experienced a while ago.
They can question me, and they'll get nothing out of me regarding FlexCoin -- cuz ive never heard of it.
**tl;dr I dont know if they can make mixing illegal, in dark wallet you can tell it is mixed because there are two identical outputs that go to separate addresses. So you can tell...but what if everyone mixed their coins?

he's talking about an attack "a couple weeks ago" (from Feb 13th) on an exchange, regarding malleability. Talking about counterfeit retail purchase receipts. saying the exchange was warned, got taken for a ride ("not much"), fixing their systems. Saying many bitcoin exchanges were stopping/limiting withdrawls of bitcoin to check their systems. says Next week (from Feb 13), this will all be "one big nothing". still watching, will update...the clip is like 2 hours long.

this needs a bit of visibility, but the answer might be more complicated. I'm sure its a free market thing. For some reason CloudFlare is one of the few companies I suppose are capable to protect large scale. They mostly achieve this with impossible CAPTCHAs when a client site is under heavy traffic load.
But from what I understand when Eluthria (BTC Guild) had issue with them it was over the fact that CloudFlare needs to have the SSL key for the websites they protect.

yes, it is still alpha. It is absolutely stable for everyday use, ive been using it whenever possible since the first alpha version (against developer requests).
I have never lost a satoshi, and have run at least 10 BTC through it.
As for mixing, you can enable auto mixing on your pocket and set a fee limit, or send a transaction with "Persistent Mixing" enabled. The latter is my option of choice, you send the TX and it broadcasts until it finds someone to mix with. No wasted fees.
Presently the fee for "automatically mix" is .0005 BTC. This is imposed on folks who chose "Auto Mixing". I prefer to enable persistence on a transaction that I initiate, with my own fee set.
Bitcoin Core is what receives my "unmixed" coins, in the event that there is a temporary outage of the blockchain server for Dark Wallet. -- I can still spend places where I am not as concerned for privacy in this way.
Mixed coins are sent from dark wallet to MyCelium as pocket change for spending.
Hope that helps.

Occam's razor. it must be something obvious.
although I myself had blockchain.info wallet send (a small amount of) change to an address I had already deleted the key for (using P2P mode, when their servers were down). I was just too lazy to file a ticket like Andreas asked, and wont ever use p2p mode again.
Do you think you could reproduce the issue?
edit to add: If the inaccessible balance can be seen on multiple computers by moving the wallet files on a fresh install, then I don't see why Multibit wouldn't want to take a look if you were willing to send them. There is even a btc wallet recovery company, if I were them i'd take it pro-bono...if it really is an unsolved mystery.

not if its sent from coinbase app to a coinbase merchant. they use off-chain transactions. 
Once I sent a friend some coin from coinbase before I stopped using their wallet (I still recommend not using their wallet, as it is SLOW too many times when sending coins to the actual blockchain). There was zero public record of such transaction, only the account history that coinbase keeps themselves.

discussions at all. Other people did though **(I got a lot of fan mail for
starting that discussion)**. If you think there's some kind of iron-clad
consensus on these topics you need to leave your mailing lists and go talk
to the general public, or heck, just try counting the number of services
that are blocking Tor because of how it's being abused.


absolute privacy at all costs, including mainstream acceptability. This
rendered its mathematical capabilities irrelevant. When Snowden wanted to
talk to Greenwald using PGP he couldn't do it because PGP sucks so badly.
The failure doesn't get more epic than that.


under-explored area:  how tolerant is society of the resultant abuse? Tor
is finding out the hard way that you don't need government coercion to end
up widely shunned. Even the developers own IRC network is now blocking Tor.
Gregory Maxwell has described Tor as heading towards a read only web, and
he's not wrong. This inherently limits its mainstream appeal and weakens
the "anonymity loves company" principle it relies on for protection.


community needs to start thinking through the consequences of that for
society at large.**

To be honest? it might not confirm. Last week, for the first time in a year ive been using BTC, I made a purchase (bitpay processor) with a 0 fee tx. They accepted it, the vendor shipped, and and the funds were returned to my wallet after about 30 hours. 
I contacted the vendor directly, he setup a blockchain wallet and I paid him that way since ive built trust with him over the last year (and have only ever spent bitcoin). I was quite surprised it **never** confirmed, nonetheless. 
Every prior purchase tx was sent without fees and did confirm, usually within 24 hours.

i cant even open my blockchain.info wallet on android.
What does this mean?
blockchain.info normally uses encryption (SSL) to protect your information. When Chrome tried to connect to blockchain.info this time, blockchain.info returned unusual and incorrect credentials. Either an attacker is trying to pretend to be blockchain.info, or a Wi-Fi sign-in screen has interrupted the connection. Your information is still secure because Chrome stopped the connection before any data was exchanged.
Network errors and attacks are usually temporary, so this page will probably work later. You can also try switching to another network.
Technical details
blockchain.info has asked Chrome to block any certificates with errors, but the certificate that Chrome received during this connection attempt has an error.

nothing is free. there is no such thing as a free lunch. the people you transfer money to likely pay account fees. Not that they'd cancel their accounts b/c of bitcoin. They may also limit the amount of these free transfers you can make per month.
However, your roomate could have sent that bitcoin to another friend using a payment processor to instantly convert to Fiat -- thus giving both parties more options to chose from.

I'm not sure, but as I understand it it is not legal to sell bitcoin if you arent a money transmitter. The few deals I did make, were with very sketchy people who had 10k in cash and didnt want to be on camera....etc. sketchy.

tbh, yeah im using it as my primary wallet. The developers have warned me against it however the biggest inconveniences are when the blockchain server (obelisk) is down which is rare, you can't do too much. I mix it by just enabling "auto" on a pocket. This uses your coins for when others send transactions using coinjoin and it doesnt happen This way you can let them mix up well -- and, often times just sending a transaction with coinjoin enabled will not mix since there arent many using it yet.
I have not lost any coins at all since alpha 0.0.1. Very impressive. Their team just seems to work fluidly and brilliantly (I follow the git commits) and they are responsive to feedback on

I get the idea of trying to almost lure new users into bitcoin, but the fact remains that if they become regular users, they will soon become familar with KYC rules.
One thing I can think of not as easily duplicated as a phone number would be a license or ID. They'll need it with bitcoin sooner or later.  This is not much better than a bank account, tho.
There's no real easy solution to this, the more I think of it.

Not missing anything, unless you didn't get that the owner of this reddit and twitter accounts is changing them, and prior to that verifying that he owns these accounts as well as verifying his ownership of the new ones by means of a PGP signed message, the authenticity of which can be confirmed by people who know him and have his Public Key on file.
In regards to coinbase, I believe Mr Chimbo was referencing the spam emails that people are getting lately, which could be verified in the same manner (if they used such a feature). Most would never verify it anyway, although I could be wrong in assuming the bitcoin demographic isnt familar with cryptographic messaging.

once it's broadcast, you're good (with minor exceptions). if the fee is so low that it never gets confirmed, it would revert to spendable from your wallet.

there's never an issue with the number of coins, that's what the block chain is for. the problem we would have is if coins that became "tainted" become unspendable either by exchange operators policy (or worse, but significanly less likely,  by a soft fork)

then, the value is derived from the features given to it by its code. Many have tried yet none have successfully duplicated. I.e., The 21 million unit limit, the fact they can't be double spent or counterfeit, the fact that they can't easily be seized (like in Cyprus). The fact that there's no such thing as a bailout, or quantitative easing. Those are just the top of my head.
I suppose if walmart were to close its doors today, the only real value it would have would be in its real estate. Everything else can and has been copied by other retailers.

go to gdax.com, login (should already be logged in if you are logged into coinbase), click "deposit", then choose "Coinbase Account". Deposit btc from there and then click Withdraw and then "BTC Address", which is free.

I'll never understand what they are thinking here, other than they are trying to exacerbate the problem since they dont pay for it anymore (and we know Brian is a big block doosh)
solution: go to gdax.com, deposit bitcoin from coinbase wallet (free), send out of gdax (free).
bonus points for sending as many .001 btc transactions out of gdax as you can. Its fun pissing away their money
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:24:52

@_date: 2017-11-26 06:50:17
Probably higher demand on coinbase with all of the new "retail" customers theyve been adding. Someone will arbitrage it on Bitfinex and the price will even out eventually. I usually check  for an averaged price.
either that, or Coinbase is the new Mt. GOX. Hopefully that's not the case.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:01:37

arent the fundamentals of bitcoin the code that runs it?
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:59:30
it is their own estimate. Compare coinbase fee with bitcoin core fees using same size transaction and you will see.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:55:51
is less than zero possible here?

@_date: 2017-11-22 10:45:58
the blowback from their whale investors would be too loud to ignore. Maybe they'll fix their broken fee estimates, or at least allow you to override it with a lower one - should you so prefer. Instead, they contribute to and exacerbate a problem that shouldn't really exist, and then blame the bitcoin network as "degraded performance" in their service advisories. 
or they could let me get my private keys and allow me to move the money with my own wallet. That'd be fine too. But they don't.
just my opinion tho.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:39:09
not at all, if you buy it back now.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:09:35

no files to copy, you would send the bitcoin as a transaction from Coinbase to the address for the hardware wallet. I'm not sure how helpful my response is but if I can help, don't hesitate to ask!

false. Abra is spectacular. Better price, too.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:56:24
true. I guess, it's just been bothering me that I've been hearing, from many different sources in very different circles, the "$6,000" price. They have spoken of it confidently for a few weeks now, and It seems like they may be right - so I'm curious where the number is coming from. Is there some magic number around there that would entice futures traders to manipulate somehow?  
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:51:48
it would be good for bitcoin

@_date: 2017-09-04 16:56:25
until lightening?
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:41:51
no. Mt Gox would probably be close to the top of the list, mostly due to the loss of funds, the lack of diversity in that sector, and the fact that they were significantly inflating the price.
Yet in the end, the only thing that matters is the technology.

just go to gdax.com while signed into Coinbase
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:42:08
any preferred guide for doing this?

you should sell then.

perhaps a better question is, how much could you not have sold before today if you got them for free? the first wallet generated many coins by just leaving it running.

I wonder about GDAX tho. lower fees
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:45:28
whenever I spend it, I try to buy it back lower while always maintaining a four BTC balance. at $85 when I got it, (and by early trading using a ghetto Coinbase app that used their API to do limit buy and sells), it cost me nothing but the money I spend trying to maintain the 4.0.

*Except nobody told that to the guy who stole 3 btc from coinbase who "accidentally sent" it to his account*
IN fact, all the posters said "This isnt fucking monopoly. There are no bank errors in your favor"
sort of interesting to see the differing opinions. In that example, mine was "Eat the loss coinbase. You messed up and now you want your money back. Maybe you shouldn't play with irreversible currencies" 
**Unfortunately** that post was removed by its poster, probally because he admitted guilt in a public forum. But I believe the situations are still eerily similar.

@_date: 2013-12-20 17:01:46
serious business don't use altcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:14:06
1) the currency being trustless is a benefit in that it cannot be counterfeit/double spent/stolen. Bitcoin can be stolen from someone you give it to, but with proper precautions, it can never be stolen from you.
Your hotwheels better not be knock-offs, and you have to prove it to me...
2) The miners verify transactions to make sure they aren't double spent using SHA-256 hashing. This is the "Code"
And yes, anyone can copy bitcoin's code and make their own bitcoin, but nobody will use it. This is what alt-coins are.
The code is bitcoin's because miners make a consensus on the code they use. If miners are working off code that isnt agreed up on, they will be working for nothing
hope that helps a bit.

This is what I do, you must have instant buy ability but it takes a few days for them to withdraw.

And charge the buyer GOX price, at very least.

reset the blockchain completely (not till first transaction as suggested by the app). In rare cases Ive recommended backing up the wallet and uninstalling/reinstalling multibit -- or running bitcoinQT to help the network =)

i guess technically until the coins are no longer created via block reward, it its not deflationary. However with lost coins being lost forever and no means to recreate them (read: quantitive easing), it thus becomes deflationary.
I welcome correction if I am mistaken.

ebay does hold the funds. They just provide an illusion that they done (i.e., chargebacks). 
SR1 as well as any other market are based on a) vendor rep (verified by PGP) b) buyer feedback c) escrow services said sites provide. Sounds a lot like ebay the more I think of it...the only difference being that SR holds your coins in escrow until they are released by the buyer...while PayPal releases the money with the threat of yanking it back later if need be. This would obviously be impossible for irreversible currencies.
Too bad there isnt an underground market that offers more legitimate products for sale...

a store of value that fluxuates so wildly is difficulty even for black markets. Perhaps moreso as there is no ability to convert to fiat instantly like BitPay does.

Check out merged mining, I have a block erupter as well and on BTC Guild (as only one example of such a pool) you can mine BTC and NMC simultaneously. I set my payout to deposit right into BTC-E.com, so if I ever get enough Namecoin I can trade it for BTC =)

It depends on what your reasons are for mining. I mine, and make like .002 btc per day. But I look at it like a hobby. Although others have compared it to "as fun as running a clock". Block erupters have gotten so cheap, and you can get them right away.

its only instant after 30 days if you add a credit card, so before that time I would split my transactions in case one got cancelled.
Everyone gets at least one order cancelled, and the price happens to rise, so thats what folks attribute it to.
