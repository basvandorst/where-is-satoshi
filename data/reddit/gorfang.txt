Ok news media, just go outside and find someone at random who looks 25-36 and ask them to go do a guest spot on Bitcoin for you, because you missed it by a mile here.

So I would say that the safe play that can still ultimately be lucrative is that you have a 401k for a reason right? 401k's exist because Now You has a hard time thinking about Future You. Now You wants to roll the dice with crypto. Take care of Future You with a strategy you know works, and put extra into bitcoin. If it's truly important to you to put whatever you can into bitcoin, live like a monk for the next couple of months and put all extra savings into bitcoin, but let that 401k be safe.

Here's the thing though: what are you trying to get out of this? Do you need a quick buck over the next 2, 5, 30 days because you figure this is going to come down permanently (or at least stagnate for &gt;1 year), or do you see this as a rising asset over years? I'm not even talking about the "to the moon" memes, but rather do you consider it a &gt;50% chance that it is worth more years from now or not? If you are an "investor" that that implies that you do not need the money any time soon so you can let time be your ally.
So I think one of the best ways to avoid the fear of "weak hands" is to either put your coin in cold storage on the exchange so you have to wait 48h before making a decision or keeping it in a wallet completely off of the exchange. When it's just sitting there ready for a temporary moment of weakness that is when bad decisions happen.
I was originally a skeptic but I am effectively a convert. The internet has changed the game. Amazon killed the brick and mortar store. Bitcoin (or some other crypto) is the beginning of the end for hard fiat. Maybe not the almighty dollar, but certainly those silver &amp; goldbugs better start looking behind their shoulder.

I know this forum is all about to the moon memes but there is serious truth to this statement. The closer you are to retirement the more you likely want to reduce risk. Keeping some is fine considering how well you've done though

Bitcoin lives in a weird world where despite the fact that I'm happy I have skin in the game it's also something I wouldn't advise to family members, because I don't trust them at all to be smart caretakers.

If it's any consolation the goal used to be the Millionaire's Club (aka having 21 bitcoins), and that seems truly imposing nowadays.

That was an awesome article, thank you for linking it. Interesting that it sort of predicted this year's events.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:23:58
Ha, my first thought as well.

Bitcoin has been around long enough that we can see patterns in its behavior, namely how human behavior works. If you're willing here's a fascinating article going into what we're seeing, albeit written over a year ago. The takeaway is the future still looks great.

Wow, I'm impressed SEC! ICOs are dangerous and predatory ones ought to be punished. Regarding the currencies, also a sensible standpoint.

I really like this answer.

So the way the market works is X number of people want to buy bitcoin, Y want to sell. The price is set by who of X want to sell at a price, and whether Y wants to buy it at that price. It's an ever flowing curve. The more people who are holding and not selling, the fewer coins are passing back and forth, which further increases the price. If you go to the Depth Chart on GDAX you can see the market in realtime as an ever flowing graph.

I have a promise to myself to hold my purchases for &gt;1 year and have offloaded everything off of exchanges onto wallets. This may suck before it gets better but in the long term I still think it's good to buy.

Now what I'm interested to see is if we get the 2nd dead cat bounce. Historically every large bitcoin correction has been followed with a double cat bounce, followed by a long stretch of slight growth.

This was a pretty good article, and it's interesting to see what's behind the curtain at Coinbase. You can tell it's a weird day however when they talk about how Bitcoin just hit 13k, and it's already above 14k.

Except this is Austria, which actually has one of the most relaxed gun laws in Europe.

if you owned literally every USD in the world, the world would no longer care about it as a currency or asset, because they would likely just use something else. Same for Bitcoin, same for probably everything aside from food, shelter &amp; water.

It's from 2017 during the crazy spike. Old man started to look like a genius as the price went crazy, then horrible when it tanked again. People are happy to roll out their old memes.

Either X smarter or dumber than I. I just bought $X, then it dipped. I figure I've been leery for most of the year and looking foolish so just said what the hey. I've either joined the trend or I'll lose it...shrug.

Emphasis here is they want you to help them invest. You're not going to win over parents who don't want your help in the first place.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:07:19
So here's the thing...parents NEVER want to hear investing/retirement advice from their children. In fact, they really don't want to hear much of any advice from their children unless they ask for it. The parent/child relationship runs deep to the core. They will not appreciate this in the slightest and you've got decades more to know these people. This advice holds true for the next several decades. I'm 20 years older than you and trying to discuss retirement strategies with parents in their 70s has been all but a trainwreck. 
TLDR: Parents will always do whatever they want with their money and don't want your advice. Sticking it to them doesn't end well.

My assumption is on interviewing many families, probably an N of 10. By all means I could be wrong but I know it's not just my own family.
