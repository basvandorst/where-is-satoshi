Keep in mind, that the supply will stop increasing sooner than in a hundred years. I think, that during our lifetime, mining new coins will not cover those which are being lost on daily basis.

And? It never was about the blocks being full or not. The only things that matters is confirmation time and price. You can very easily keep the block full with minimum fee, which affects completely no one. 
Yes, the block size should and will go higher than 8 MB. But this will happen only when there is so much adoption, that fees will be something to be considered when you are paying for the coffee. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:24:13
What breaks in my theory if someone pays 2 sat/B? 
Then this transactions passes by and that's great, the network prioritize the "real" (ie higher fee) transaction. If I, being an attacker, want to interfere with people using 2 sat/B fees, I have to double my attack cost. Then, the user, pays 3 or even 4 sat/B, which is still considered as "nothing", and attacker has to quadruple its initial cost, and so on... In case of 8 MB, real attacks are extremely costly. Way more than 8 x times, that one could assume.

I love all those answers like "you're so stupid, lol, my kid knows that not true, google it!". 
Could you elaborate on this 5th grade math of yours?
Here's my take on that:
If block is not full, all you need is to propagate a lot of transactions with, e.g. 1 sat/B fee. You will only have to pay number of transactions x fee mentioned above. 
If you'll use thousands of small inputs in each transactions, you will need just a few of those to fill the block.
Anyway, this doesn't affect the users in any way, as anything above the attacker's fee will pass through. If blocks are generically full, then attacker has to spend less, but that's also a place when you have to consider yet another scaling solution (block size increase included...). Not gonna happen in next couple of years.

There are different estimates on how much gold there is in the world (and they are mining it quicker than our miners do mine BTC), but roughly 21 millionth part of all the gold would around ~10kg, not one.
The one-million-club (as is with 21 BTC) starts at 200 kg of gold and it's worth ~7,5 million USD. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 12:45:48
Your question is: what will happen when BTC price will hit 10k USD. 
Nothing special. It'll be just 10 x more valuable, and probably much less volatile. 
What wee need to have, is not price per se, but users and mainstream recognizance as a serious asset.

This poll is as misleading as any ~~USA~~ *mainstream* news TV channel. 
As a BU supporter, I would never vote in this kind of "survey" just because of the misleading names. 
BTC is and always was, the tag for Bitcoin. BTU is just a trashy name implying that this is not the real bitcoin. It is used mostly among Bitcoin Core supporters. 
I know, you don't like BU, but please try to be honest with yourselves. BU supporters will never agree on branding "their coin" as something different than real bitcoin, ie. BTC.

Nice to read something like this in a place like here. 
I am a strong BU supporter myself, and not so long ago I was sure both SegWit and LN will go through. Nevertheless, I decided to hodl no matter what and accept will of network (ie. majority). I was strongly against HOW is bitcoin growing up, but I never stop believing in WHAT it is. Bitcoin is, should be, *must be* a world wide, state-independent currency/asset. How it will accomplish these goal, is a secondary issue.
If we believe in democracy and value Nakamoto's vision of consensus, we should also accept the fact, that many times, many people (I or you...) will disagree with the majority. And that is fine, that is what we signed up for.
No matter which way it will go now, it will face different problems in the future. But everything will work out just fine. Of this, I am sure.

Having one million dollars in 1 cent coins vs in $100 bills is the same issue. Keeping it secure, storing for longer periods of time and spending it, is not the same for those options. Nevertheless, in theory they both have the same value.
It's the same for your bitcoin example. You can have one 1 BTC or 1000 mBTC. The nominal value is the same, but the underlying asset differs in a way of particles. 
It can, but does not have to cost more (thus making it less valuable). If you'll pay 1 mBTC fee for both set of inputs (1 vs 1000), you have high chance on sending them both successfully to the output. What varies here, is time you need to wait until the transaction is done (as it would be with one million dollars in one cent coins).
What's more, when you send transaction made of a thousand 1 mBTC coins, the receiver will end up with 1 full BTC in one "BTC bill". Which is neat "auto-upgrade". 
@_date: 2016-11-24 08:59:05
I am soooo confused whenever someone mentions SPV and/or prune.
SPV means you only need blocks' headers and blocks with unspent output, right? You can have it all on you machine and be completely secure using only couple of GB. 
Leeching data from full nodes is "Bloom filtering" (keeping to Multibit naming). 
Please, correct me if am wrong.

In ELI5:
Bitcoin is a set of files, that we call "Blockchain". Those are ordinary files, like your thesis written in MS Word. What's really important, is what those files contain: list of all the bitcoins that exist, and addresses to which each bitcoin belongs. Address is like an e-mail address, you can have as many as you want. Simple, isn't it?
Where are those files kept? On every computer with right bitcoin application (like Bitcoin Core). Each machine in the world, has a copy of them, so you can't change it and send to someone without making anyone notice. Also, all of those programs make sure, that each of those files is written according to set of rules. Like total number of bitcoins (21 mln) or making sure, that no one uses bitcoins, that are not his. Simple, isn't it?
How to add data to those files? This is called mining. Why the name? Because the first person, that create valid new file, is allowed (by the rules!) to give himself set of new bitcoins! Creating the files is hard because of mathematics rules. Simple, except for the math part :)
How can you prove, that specific bitcoins are yours? As mentioned above, each bitcoin is assigned to one address at the time. Addresses are always created in pairs. One address ends up in blockchain, and the second one in you pocket/wallet. They do match, thus you can always prove your ownership with your "key".
I hope it was ELI5 enough! :)

@_date: 2016-12-06 12:32:33
I guess the time is coming. We need a kind of consortium composed of the biggest BTC companies (exchanges, pools, devs, etc), that will give their "Approved" mark to all the wallets. It is in best interest of us all. If you want, you can use whatever you want. But if you want to be secure, there should be a simple way to check which wallets/apps are secure.
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:50:34
It is not about alternative clients, it's about alternative solutions. Nevertheless, alternative clients, that many people use to spend and hold bitcoins ARE tagged as "altcoin discussion" and removed, which I don't understand.
Back to the topic. It is not allowed to propose anything else than the LN itself. I've seen so many normal and essential posts and highly upvoted topics removed, that I don't know what to make up of this. I see point of LN, but ambient around it is not making me any easier to support those people. 
We are talking about two separate topics right now: censorship and block size. We can't stay consistent with our discussion without focusing on one. Therefore, I'll just say one more thing, that I would put as a common ground between those two issues:
If there would be a consensus, SegWit would have much higher approval rate, or at least, the acceptance graph would have different shape. Today, nobody even knows if it will be trigged before deadline next November. Discussion on is all about "those damns devs!" and on is like "those damn miners". We do not communicate well.

As you know, Trezor = hardware + paper wallet. So you have got advantages of both. Having just a paper wallet is taking one but leaving another. There are no obvious benefits having only paper, or only hardware.
So let's take it apart: hardware is for usability, paper is for security. Without paper, you can't be secure. You can lose, break, have stolen your hardware wallet. Paper is just more durable, if you secure it well. Thus, making couple of copies keeps you secure. 
If we are talking long-term holding, then hardware wallet is really bad idea. Especially if you're going to use general-use device TYPE. Mobile &amp; PC are never going to be entirely secure, event the new ones. 
Event though, relying solely on a paper is not a good idea. Especially, if you are not savvy enough. First of all, it is only for saving, ie. one way transactions. If you want so spend it, you have to import it. Whatsmore, you have to SPEND IT ALL AT ONCE. There was a few of people, who thought that spending half of funds will make other half go back to the paper. It don't. 
So whenever you'll move from paper, you have to go full into hardware. And that is not secure if you have to do it on PC or mobile. 
Also, not securing paper properly, can make you loose it all in a very stupid way. You have lost you main copy, and can't get to the back'up one after 15 years of holding? Bummer. You have made a QR code and now it is not readable? Bummer. You have took it of you safe, and security camera got a glimpse of it? Bummer.
Trezor is really great solution as a hybrid. You can easily spend, and securely hold. But still, you need to know how to handle and secure paper part of it.

I just said, that it might lead to discussions like this, not that they are already here.
What's more, I already received a warning from mod for "trolling", so I don't know if I can go with this discussion anymore. But from what I see, Bitcoin Core main goal is to keep 99% of transaction off-chain, and keeping low block size is the best means to do so (for many people this relation is in opposite direction, I am aware of it). 
Many people disagree with it (if I am wrong, we will see very soon 80%+ acceptance of SegWit), and think that we should allow to grow not only BlockChain (in a generic way), but also the block size itself (without blocking opportunity for future growth - allowing it for a similar generic grow). THIS is implying that Core Devs are wrong.

You will not have any decentralization if fees are to high.

No single scaling solution will. We need block size increase (on a regular basis), we need payment channels (LN) and we need side chains. 
Ono of the problems this community has, is not being technical enough. All the discussions in here (and not only here) are just about who likes whom and who is the bigger threat to their vision. Which should not matter in trust-less network...
We've ended up in a situation, whit two "distinct" groups:
1. "small blockers": they agree, that the block size must be increased, but they think we should put more effort into other solutions first.
2. "big blockers": they agree, that we need other than block size increase scaling solutions, but they think we should put more effort to do something asap to fix the ongoing congested network issue.
...both sides wants the same! But due to lack of technical context, they cant come to agreement. We need proofs, we need math, and we need a good data base with all the (re)sources on HOW and WHY should we do WHAT.

If your transaction is not getting confirmed, then it is not due to huge amount of low fee tx. That's for one, and the second thing: why me paying low fee is spam? Most of transaction are not time-critical, why would I pay more?
Please, see this and then decide for yourselves, how does it work:
Edit: spelling

You =/= decentralization. Also, what fees are fine with? If fee will go as high as $1000, will you use it? Who then? Who will keep on mining, keeping up nodes and actually using the network? 
You don't care for the poor (bigger) part of the world, but you will, once the fees are too high for you too.

I think so, but I didn't check the code myself. From a very quick glimpse there is quite a few lines changed that are not part of the source code (ie logic) per se. 
I am very much interested in how many LLOC (logical) was changed, not SLOC (physical). 
Just skim through the commits:

And many of them is betting their lives on that. 
Even if Bitcoin will outperform the loan's interest by thousands %%, then it still might not happen before they will be forced pay it off. The month they have (or just plan) to sell it, Bitcoin might be once again on -80% sale. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:23:18
Exactly as explained. Try read on what actually is mining.
In few words: blocks should be mined on average every 10 minutes. If the time between blocks is shorter, then the difficulty is being increased. If it is longer, then the difficulty will get lowered. This all in order to keep 10 min between blocks constant. 
But it doesn't always work. Right now there are huge variations in the mining power due to competition from BCH and time between each block varies a lot (the difficulty adjustment algorithm can't keep up with this).
Each block always contains 1 MB of transaction. It is not allowed to put more. So, if blocks are mined on, let's say, every 20 minutes, then there is half of transaction that would be normally confirmed. 
Taking under consideration, that number of transactions created is still increasing, we get a huge network jam when ever blocks are mined more slowly.

I sens that someone is rationalizing his decision not to buy on ATH... that was made a long time ago. 
You're right, wait for the dip. I am pretty sure that one (like -50%) must happen just after we'll hit $100k. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:19:31


You rich fuck! Not everyone here earned something!
Many of us could've, but they still didn't buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:20:44


Exactly. I need to know options and possibilities. I need to know the status of each developed proposal. If I don't, then I can't keep on hodling. It just would be irrational to do so. 
If scaling problem can't be solved, then the experiment has failed. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:05:09
I know, but also tried to keep it as eli5 as possible. Hard to stay correct and simple at the same time when we're talking technology!

And I've read that its who are crazy conspiracy aluminium foil covered heads. 
Whoever can get more out of bitcoin - should. If the most profitable approach is the one that is being fully utilized, then this is the stable strategy. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:29:33
This guy gets it. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:53:25
I don't hate you guys. I am in favor of BCH as much as BTC. I have similar amount of coins on both chains (so in USD terms way more in BTC). I respect everybodys opinion and I really can't get why there is so much religious-like hatred in here. It's like: you are with us, or are a nazi and should go to hell. 
I HODL BTC as much as I HODL BCH. I HODL them both very much! Why is it so inconceivable thing for you? I don't know. 
Also, your strong opinion on other coins being a scam, does NOT give you right to be a dick about it.
I hate only all the hate in here.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:41:49
I didn't think about it until recently. Now, that's the plan. HODL, and consolidate on the next empty-pool window. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:39:18
Do you always call every person who disagree with you a shill? 
I have serious concerns about LN development progress. Those concerns made me move part of my BTC holdings to BCH. Even thou I own more value in BTC than in BCH, I disagree with you and think that BCH technical advantages. Ergo, I am shill. 
Did I get right? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:53:11
PoT - proof of twitter. I really can't get why Satoshi didn't think about it. Really, it is sooo more cheap, easy and understandable for anyone. 
Also, solves the problem of miners attacking the network... 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:40:24
Last time I've checked the front page of this sub, I thought that I've seen a topic that was not a price-meme. But at the second look it turned out it was. 
Here we are, @_date: 2017-11-15 07:19:02
I don't think, that any FUD is needed, but I also disagree with blind ignorance. There are issues that **must** be solved if Bitcoin is going to success. We have to discuss those openly. 
Either you are forgetting or don't know, but naming the problem with just "high fees" is great oversimplification. We need to remember, that fees are not only high, but they are getting higher and higher, and always will be (ie until off-chain transaction will be possible).
The real problem we're facing, is the limit of transaction per day, that has been reached years ago. Can any us say honestly, that they never did avoid or postponed making a transaction just because of fees? This is what is going on. We have more and more users, but the transaction count stays the same, so we have less and less transfers per person.
Whatever amount of people USING the network we have today, WILL NOT GROW. Influx of new people, will only make poorer part of us unable to make any transfer. And this part is already quite big. 
I have big part of my savings in BTC. I can't ignore its problems and I need assurances from the dev team, that LN is on a good way to becoming functional. 
It feels sad, to be too poor to use bitcoins...
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:52:16
Sooo... sell the same thing under different name hoping that people will not find out? 
You mean... mislead people? 
Shame. 
What Bitcoin community should... ney, MUST do, is the opposite. Inform and educate, open midness and willingness to discuss openly.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:48:15
Exactly! I really can't understand why people still forget that the real solution it is only 18 months away! 
We've been telling this for years now... 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:39:57
You've missed my point. I am not advocating for simple block size increase every now and then. I am all in for LN, sidechains AND blocksize increase. It's just I like to see and understand the math behind each solution. For LN, it has some holes in its logic.
I **would** provide you with more valid points, but I tend not to argue with people who have toxic nature and are aggressive toward people they disagree with. 
Please, read once again your post, and tell me you're not being a dick and/or offending. It's quite obvious, that you're emotionally attached to whatever opinion you have and thus, not open-minded, which is always required in technical discussions.

Not everything. Most of crypto subs seem to be fine and most financial subs are actually nice. It's just and that are extremely aggressive towards each other (or anything/anyone not in line with their opinions). Not mentioning highest up-votes count being way to often on "they are so stupid, not like us, haha!" threads.
What I like about S2X, it that both extremes are against it. It would be nice to see both and leaving this community. Just trim it on both sides.
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:54:56
Well, the unique addresses graph made me nervous. Almost every user is creating new addresses every time they send/receive money. Thus, if active user base increases, then this graph should be more exponential than linear. 
Way more than it is.
Guys, you are HODLing to much. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 09:07:16
The grand prize of "Shitholder".
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:27:13
More like trying to make a joke out of Coinbase, and then proving their nonsense in the discussion. Which, for me, is just a hundredth thread with zero substantial value repeating the same thing over and over again, not even trying to start a real discussion. 
If the discussion is just for laughs, then I apologize. Its just not in my taste. For me both of the subs are extremely blinded and determined no to accept different opinions nor allow any rational discussion. Threads like this, don't help to solve the real issue, by which I mean the community, not chain, split. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:27:07
Thanks mate, already feel better about myself. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:19:49
Yeah, like no other webpage ever went blank for a while.
Why so clickbaity? Why so offensive? Why not just wait for facts, before calling people thieves?
@_date: 2017-10-10 09:00:30
Is this sub about Bitcoin or Ver? Because lately its hard to tell. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:38:11
Damn... you've fallen low, You don't agree with someone, so you're organizing mass down-voting on app store? They are doing what is best according to them, they are not stealing anything, they are not lying, they are not forcing anyone. They are both honest and transparent. 
Many people agree with them (call me brainwashed), so your truth is not the objective one. Don't act then like it would be.
I bet most of you guys are not even their customer to have right to complain. You're just a mindless lemmings. Am I right? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:48:24
You must be one of the stupidest people in this sub. Stop running around shouting out things you don't understand and trying to counterarguments valid points with just a random mutation of "I don't understand it, duh!".
No, technical documents are not meant to be understood by uneducated publicity. Those are not "expensive words" (whatever you've tried express by this... thing), those are precise words that require some basic context to be understood. And you are very welcome to create your own coin without developers. Ya'know, some nice rocks or shiny shells. 
The only thing I agree with you is that Bitcoin community should stop fighting and start working together, but looking at the OP and the conversation above you couldn't be any more hypocritical.
Don't troll Coinbase nor your fellow Redditors, better spend some time on learning and understanding some basic stuff, god dammit. 
Shout out to @_date: 2017-10-27 12:58:37
I am really sorry for your loss. Don't mind all the hate you're getting here. You've learned your lesson, and shared it with us, which probably will save someone from here,from doing the same in the future.
On the bright side, that could make quite a good ice breaking / party story (in the future, when you cool down from this loss). You know, not many people can start a conversation with: "Well, I once lost $120k, but whatever mate" ;)
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:52:10
Sadly, that's very accurate description.

Did you read what you've posted? They stated, that they will follow whichever chain wins. 


@_date: 2017-10-06 11:02:24
I do, but it is hard to be here and support it. You know, being a target in one of the most toxic subbreddit is nothing nice. 
90% is arguments against this solution are just offensive and speculative attacks. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:54:54
If you are right about the market and people preferring the original chain, then there is no issue. Miner will very quickly switch to the more profitable chain (no charity included) and XAPO will follow the same chain. 
But if you are wrong, they will still follow the chain that is winning. Of course, the another will be supported for as long it will live.
Anyway, I would be *very* much afraid to keep my funds in any wallet, that **picks** which chain they will follow independently of how it will turn out in the future. 
Like... should they promise to follow XYZ chain, and if this one dies, then no harm done and no regrets? Only some funds are gone, right? Or maybe they should promise to follow this chain... but then change their mind if it will be unusable?
No. They might be right or wrong, but what they did is very rational thing to do. And they have right to do so. 
You might disagree, you have right to leave a bad review, but doing what this thread is doing is BAD on so many levels. 
We are on the opposite sides. Someone has to be wrong in the end. I don't mind. But I hate UNfair-play.

One rule, one goal, one bitcoin:
I think I will not sell ever my bitcoins. If the project will fail, I will lose initial investment, but I believe it was worth the ride! If it will not fail, then... well, let's say that my children will be very happy with what I am going to leave them.

It has almost half of the BTC hashrate, soon it might get the majority.
Yes, we care about what Bitcoin is.

There is a reason, why 80% of mining power was invited and participated, and BS wasn't. Think about it and get a clue, why people who invested hundred of millions USD in this technology didn't want those guys.

Ask yourself, what is the core of Bitcoin. Then ask, what allowed this invention. And finally, why there was no crypto before PoW.
Without PoW in the present form (as introduced by Satoshi) it is yet another fiat currency, that it controlled by the big exchanges that create illusion of people being in power. CryptoDemocracy? Naaah, thanks, I'll stick with CryptoAnarchy.

FYI: your ROI goes down if you buy at higher price. 
Of course, it is much better have 50% ROI on 100k USD than 90% ROI on 100 USD base. 
What goes up is your ROR (rate of return). 
@_date: 2016-07-12 11:37:36
I was going to state the same thing... damn! The ignorance of the people, from who the pop masses are learning, is above the roof! Normal men will be confused for a really long time, if they will learn of BTC from those mainstream sources. 
But on the other hand, it may be better to have "anything" said that "nothing". 
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:41:30
First of all - it depends on where you live. It can be more than "minimal" wage in many places. Also, it is so much more fun.
Second of all - well, just le'me feel more confident, and we'll shift the scale times X.

Well, in case of war and/or food shortage, neither of those will help you out with good sleep. Maybe it's time to enrich your portfolio with some land scattered in different parts of world?

Well, today I came to the same conclusion, but in the other way around ;) It has been almost a month, since I started daily and margin trading with BTC. During this period, I have made 24 transaction, from which, 20 where in my favor! I earned ~0.69 BTC and lost ~0.15 BTC (so in total I am +0,55 BTC). Not that much, but still I am sooooo proud of myself! 
Also, thanks OP for standing on the other end of the contracts :)
