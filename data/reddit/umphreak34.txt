Hey I am with Coinvoice.  We can most definitely help you out with this situation.  If your employer uses a US financial institution then you should be good to go.  You would invoice your employer using Coinvoice, then once payment is received you will be sent BTC (at the current market rate).  If you have any more questions feel free to PM me and I can walk you through the process.  Cheers!

Thanks for your kind words about btcd.  We've strived to create good, clean, fully-tested code.  We feel the cleaner the code, the more people of the bitcoin community can join us in creating the protocol of the future.
