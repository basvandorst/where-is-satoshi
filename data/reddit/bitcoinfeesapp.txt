Sound like you need to send a bit less than the total amount, otherwise there’s nothing left to pay the fees with.
You can set custom fees in Copay, check out the [Bitcoin Fees app]( to see what sort of fee is required and how long it will take to confirm.

There are no guarantees when using a fee guide, they are estimating using recent transaction history. It’s possible that lots of high fee transactions are made directly after yours, causing an unforeseen delay to your payment.
If it’s an urgent transaction then probably best to use a slightly higher fee than recommended.

After the first confirmation, then subsequent confirmations will be at an average of rate of once every 10 minutes.

Another option is to try a transaction accelerator like [this one]( 
Worth a try but there’s no guarantees, the mempool is just massively congested at the moment.

It’s likely that the fee estimation algorithm they use, took into account the large data size of the transaction and that probably (wrongly) heavily impacted the recommended fee.

Ah ok. Unfortunately that’s a very low fee for the current mempool conditions. You are looking at around a week for that to confirm.

If you are in a hurry for that transaction to go through you could try a transaction accelerator like [ViaBTC]( 
Or replace-by-fee if your wallet supports it.
Otherwise it’l just be a long wait.

The mining fees are paid according to the size of the transaction in bytes. A transaction with multiple inputs will have a larger data size than a transaction with one input and 2 outputs, so the total fee will be higher.
The miners will usually choose transactions with higher fees to include in the block because it will make them more money. 
Fees are usually shown as Satoshi’s/byte.

Exchanges operate differently to wallets, so the way they deduct fees is different.
Real wallets are more payment focused so the amount sent needs to be the exact amount you want to send. That wouldn’t work if you had to figure out the exact fee that was going to be deducted from your payment amount.
