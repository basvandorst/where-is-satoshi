I could send you 500BTC but before you have it and before you can sell it, it will be worth less then 500 USD.

Well in 20 years you can tell your child about how bitcoins where once worth 250 dollars ....

Yes, thank you. I might have sold a little to much btc the last  couple of days ... the price is now way lower .... me sad russian.

Hahaha, tomorrow everything gone.
Good luck waiting 10 years without loosing the coins.
Then I want to see the day when they choose the next cryptocurrency over bitcoin because it's just a little better designed. In Russia, we laugh.

10 year without forgetting a brainwallet.
10 years without your kids using your paper wallet to light a fire
10 years without your HD crashing and your backup being corrupt
10 years without your online storage crashing and you loosing your data
10 years is a long time my friend. You better make an excesive amount of backups  ... but wait .... the more backups  ... the easier they can steal your coins. When you have 300 000 K coins ... your friends will know in 10 years ... they will know. One photo of a papper wallet .... bye bye coins .... one slip of the tong about your brain wallet .... bye bye. Docter please save his memory! He has 10 million euro's in his mind. Save him! Please! Hey you, don't you dare drink with 300 K bitcoins in your head. 
etc etc
I would put 10% of my savings in a brain wallet, let my kid memorize it and tell him: You will get this btc when you are 18. Don't tell the phrase to anybody or ever drink anything. You loose it, your problem. (it would be a dual ok adress. Coins on the adress need an ok from two different adresses before you can move the coins. So the kid cannot steal them, only loose them.

I have found about 70 BTC in various addresses by generating brain wallet private keys with phrases from the US Constitution, Libertarian documents and quotes from Ron Paul. I did transform every phrase a couple of thousand times.  (adding numbers, leet speaking it, adding common names and common passwords, etc etc)
Remember people think alike. That's why brain wallets are a bad idea.
If you can come up with a very clever nice pass phrase based on something popular on the internet or a quote from a movie, so can I.
And I will find your coins. (found 500 BTC in 2 months, lucrative business)

At the end of the game and before the new one starts, everybody will get there lost bitcoins back. 
The new game will start in 2014.
