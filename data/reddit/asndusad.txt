There's a problem with your story: they were able to "take" the safe.  Any good safe requires professional safe moving equipment to move anywhere.  As far as I'm concerned, if you're storing large amounts of bitcoin in a safe, it should have taken several hours and hundreds of dollars to have a professional safe installer move it into your house for you.

So, law enforcement is going to tie energy usage statistics to your mining output address?  Sure.. that's possible.

"Impossibly useful" - Do you mean "extremely useful?"  And for what you're talking about re:file storage, look at Storj, MaidSafe, etc.  Your "cloud computing" idea is essentially folding or related projects.  Graphics cards are actually rather good at doing the calculations required for folding and would be great for your f(x) example.
Is gold a bad store of value because it's deflationary?  The volatility comes from the market cap and trading volume being so small right now.  As more players enter the market, volatility will decrease.  And saying early adopters have been rewarded unjustly isn't true - they took all the risk when no one even knew what Bitcoin was.  Are early adopters always unfairly rewarded?  That just sounds like jealousy.
Incentive to invest isn't about avoiding inflation - it's about creating functional businesses.  Also, it's "Case in point" not "Point in case".
People would spend bitcoin and immediately replace it with more bitcoin - Coinbase already allows you to do this automatically.  There's no reason to hoard it when you can buy more.
No chargebacks with cash, and for some reason people still use it.  Is cash a comical first-try attempt at money?

A few people were trying to discuss this at Bitcoin in the Beltway, but it turned into an anarchy circlejerk rather quickly.  I wish you luck with this!

Yay just got a card with my points from my huge Amazon gift card purchase a while back.

Came here looking for this.  Thanks.  Sometimes I have misinformed dribbles at night...

Um yeah merchants pay that... have you ever used a credit card?

Just verified it's impossible to send those 800 bits anywhere now...

I think you're not scoping properly - there's a LOT here.  If you take a project like OpenBazaar and modify it to allow for voting, proposals, etc. that would probably be the easiest way to implement the beginnings of your idea in a completely decentralized fashion.

If you want to argue that US Code is not law, this might not be the right place.

I agree with some of the other comments: just hash it and upload the hash to

I think of these guys like the "heroes of gun rights" that walk into Chipotle with assault rifles.
It's fine if you want to do what they're doing, but I don't want the press to think that Bitcoin == Dark Wallet.  As long as they differentiate themselves by saying "mainstream bitcoin has all these issues, and we're trying to fix those with out software," I'm cool with it.

Stainless steel would probably last quite a while - grind your key into that.

1 tx in, 1 tx out.  800 bits did appear in my account after I sent the transaction, but still, wtf.  I guess I'll never be able to remove those since they require such a large fee cover.  They should not need to withhold fees since it's VERY easy to calculate the exact fees needed for any transaction in bitcoin before sending it.  Their system sucks.  I'm done with it.
