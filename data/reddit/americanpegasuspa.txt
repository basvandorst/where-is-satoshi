The minimum requirements before you invest your hard earned money (fiat or crypto) in any business are as follows;
1. Details (names, resume, etc) of the CEO and all other Directors/Board members so that you can check you are not dealing with known criminals or characters of a dubious nature who may have scammed before.
2. Copies of companies accounts over at least the last 3 or 4 years so that you can evaluate things like profit, cash-flow etc and to be sure you are not just propping up a lame duck.
3. The full legal documentation relating to your investment so you can pay attention to things like which set of laws in which country can be used if you find you have been scammed and see which reputable firm of lawyers has put their name on it.
Do we have any of the above with Mycelium ?

Please stop focusing on the fiat price. There are more important things to discuss and, if you can, work on. These are very very early days in the world of cryptocurrency.
One of the reasons bitcoin has had so much fiat price volatility is that so many have lept on the bandwagon in the hope of it being a get rich quick scheme. It is nothing of the sort. Sure, if you can afford to lose it, buy a bitcoin or 2 but do not expect it to be worth much more than what you paid in the short term (i.e. less than 5 years). In fact it may well be worth a half or a quarter of what you paid at sometime. Does that matter ? If it does then perhaps you are happier "investing" in something else less volatile.
I suggest a 5- 10y time horizon is much more realistic for any Bitcoin "investment" and there is a significant probability you will lose all or most of your hard earned $$. Short term is NOT the name of this game.

I have more than I need already, trying to offload a few and spread the love. Generally selling locally face-to-face for cash as I find there is a demand for instant clean (no taint) coins and I can get a premium of 10-30% over exchange prices, sometimes more for smaller amounts under 2.0 BTC .

Ah, Yes !! The good old days when one could engage in playful banter with or about whether the coin had any similarity to tulips and discuss at length the definition of a "ponzi scheme". They were good times indeed, one could post here without fear or favour and each comment would stand on its own merits with regard to upvotes/downvotes. In those day of course the mods were busy with "other things" and really left us to play nicely amongst ourselves. Very little censorship, if any, IIRC.
Although I think OP is a little confused if he thinks the market cap is higher now, surely when a single BTC was worth over $1140 is nearer the mark. However I suspect many of the enthusiasts that were around in those days have "moved on" and the current glitterati are more correctly referred to as "new bagholders" as I believe they refer to them over at Also I think the statistics show that the VC funds being injected now are well below the peak rate of last year and as for press coverage I very rarely see anything about bitcoin in mainstream media compared to Nov 2013-March 2014 when it was quite hot.
Network transactions are indeed high right now however there is a general consensus that lots of this is spam. Some may still think "this is good for bitcoin" but I suspect that in the real world of finance a system which gets partially crippled by deliberate micro transactions is not seen as very robust.
In conclusion; The bitcoin experiment has had a good run, lots of things have been discovered but right now we appear to be in a rather "sticky patch". Will bitcoin come out the other side stronger, will it go on to greater things, or are the cryptoenthusiasts now shifting their attention to other altcoins which have been designed not to have some of these problems ?
Time will tell ! Best keep a close eye on some of those other coins even if you are are confirmed BTC hodler, the behaviour of crowds is rather telling when situations like this are happening.

In the world of unregulated exchanges security is indeterminate. You can try relying upon reputation but this has backfired before as you never know when an exit scam might materialise. If you have your BTC in your own wallet i.e. not held in an exchange account you are already ahead of the game. Personally I favour a system of personal face to face selling but you do need to know what you are doing. And as Bitcoin is a cash equivalent I only sell for fiat cash. This has security implications regarding where when and how you do it.
I won't be detailing my full Standard Operating Procedure for face to face sales here but the matter has been discussed many times before on here and other forums so do your research if you want to go down this route.
BTW you will usually find you can sell at a premium to quoted exchanges prices as the buyer gets their BTC instantly which is worth something.

Unfortunately you appear to be under the delusion that this is a game of making money (all buy and it goes up, fuck about with it and it does not).
This is far from what bitcoin is. It is an experiment in digital case. An experiment that has numerous problems and difficulties. So far it looks like the "system" is not very good at over coming said problems. Perhaps it is time to take a wider view and realize that bitcoin has really had its day and is now likely to be overtaken by a better cryptocurrency which has learned from the mistakes Satoshi made and has been more carefully designed so that the problems seen with bitcoin are avoided.
There are many contenders for the new crypto-winner. Which one do you think is better than bitcoin , and why ?

1) The apparent lack of your so called traditional (it's a ponzi + other flavours) troll on is entirely due to the actions of mods here banning dissenting voices. I could say lots more about internet censorship and manipulation of sentiment but I am sure you can work that out for yourself.
2) It was always the case that the bitcoin space was infested with people and organization who's only interest was making money. Sure there were (and are) a few who believe in the cause of crypto but the vast majority are in it for the $$$$.
It is effectively a fundamental problem for any open decentralized payment system that it can quickly be populated by big players (e.g. mining pools) who will exploit and manilpulate for their own ends. Traditional (fiat) payment systems are of course highly regulated to minimise this. Cryptos, without regulation, will always be susceptible to this.
I doubt very much there are enough possible tweaks one can make to the protocol to solve this issue. It may however be possible to design a new crypto more resistant to such manipulation but why would you want to mine it, use it, speculate on it unless there was some money in it for you ? Only if you are a true crypto believer of course. Are there enough of us left ?
Finally it may be instructive to look at dogecoin and the rather different philosophy over there. It gives you a few clues as to what direction you need a crypto to run to be more like the ideal of a trustless decentralized virtually free payment system.

But the continued behaviour of bitcoin bubbles, whether out and out pump/dump or for "other reasons" seriously mitigates use as a currency for the purchase of real world goods and services. 
I know it is NOT a Ponzi but unfortunately there is an element on here who treat it as if it were by their own actions. If you were to stop obsessing about the price so much, stop treating it as a way to get rich personally and instead concentrate you efforts in making it more suitable for real world use (solve scaling problems, etc) then there is a chance (in the long term) this crytocurrency experiment might actually get somewhere.
Too many of you are simply "investors" with a greedy eye. We need fewer of those sort and more people who are willing to contribute to making Bitcoin work better.

In light of all the "exit" scams, closed exchanges, hacked exchange data bases and numerous reports of SFYL I seriously wonder why anyone would want to use a Bitcoin exchange that is unregulated by any authorities. surely we have moved on from the days of the "wild west" and common sense should now dictate that ONLY regulated exchanges should be on your list of ones to consider.
The market will decide. The more Bicoin users move to regulated exchanges then the more we will find existing exchanges get regulation / approval. After all it is your hard earned $ (or whatever) which you are risking so surely minimising the risk is the sensible option.

Quite right, proof of identity relies upon several items of independent corroborating evidence.

Ideally move to/using another wallet, not the current trezor or if you have to use the current trezor move it all at least 20 times. I will discuss the scenario shortly when you have confirmed your cold store has been safely emptied and secured elsewhere.

Actually a play on the word miner / minor which of course sounds the same when spoken. A bit like [this recent classic]( To be honest I am not surprised most of you don't "geddit" as you generally have a poor sense of humor, lack of knowledge of the real world and a complete inability to laugh at yourselves and some of the ridiculous things that go on with bitcoin like it being used for anonymous child porn purchases.
Do I win the prize yet ?

Not on your fantasy world obviously but in the real world of entertainment which I have had the priviledge to work in for over 19 years in close proximity to many many famous award winners it does indeed. Sorry for your loss.

This is a VERY good question. Keep watching all the usual suspects, don't forget (like Columbo) even silence can mean something significant.

Yes, yes, we all know its early May. Do you get like this every year ?

If Satoshi wanted to prove his identity there would be several possible avenues apart from using a private key. I therefore conclude that if Craig Wright is Satoshi he actually does not want to prove it by that methodology OR Craig is NOT Satoshi.

IF readers want the Bitcoin to become mainstream in WORLD finance then one thing will help. Getting rid of all the criminals that currently infest the Bitcoin space. Please report any criminal activity relating to the Bitcoin to your local law enforcement. We need the criminals OUT NOW ! They have ruined the Bitcoin over the last 3 years and damaged it badly. Time to grow up, get rid of all this illegal/immoral stuff and there just might be a chance of the Bitcoin moving forwards in the real world of finance.

Follow the money.
Investigate Wright's companies. Have a look at the structure and in particular the Bitcoin holdings and transfers. 
Draw conclusions about the nature of the man and what he is trying to achieve with those companies and transactions.
Clarify how he has benefited. What are the likely consequences as these transactions "unravel" and what are the implications regarding LEA /Tax authority ?

When I saw Derren make contact with my late grandmother I was so happy and glad to say so for the camera crew. Later when I watched the programme on TV....

Presume you mean NDA=Non disclosure agreement ? Makes no sense, Gavin gave details of what went on in the meeting anyway. Remember the part about the "mistake" in leaving ofF "CSW" on the message and having to inseret the USB stick a second time. That is pretty detailed stuff. He could come forward and say something about "other proof" even if it was in vague terms but in reality he said nothing except that he "was convinced" !

You will laugh about it when the same thing happens to Craig Nakamoto Dundee next week and some lucky miner gets a large surprise !

OK guys - lets have a show of hands;
All those who want it to go up so they can sell some/all at a fiat profit ?
All those who want it to go up but will still hodl (and/or buy more).
Lets hear it (please be honest now !)

It is important to the people who think it is important and not to you. Free personal choice, my friend.
Some people might place great importance on things he would say about money, liberty, security. Others would say his views are no more relevant than mine. 
If you don't get the drama just leave those  who do in their own clique.

The best thing you can do with such a small fraction of a bitcoin is to stop measuring it in $. 
Then wait.
Maybe a bit longer.
Perhaps another year.

Quite likely actually. I have various 4/5/6 figure fiat sums in various things but last week bet $50 on a horse (no correct battery staple involved).

Spot on . Spotted earlier by others though.
