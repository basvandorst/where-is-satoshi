Ok thank you

I know bitcoin prices fluctuate which is why I asked what people here would estimate it would be, I wasn't asking for exact numbers, just something like "I think it will be worth about $109 more" or "you'll lose 90% of that"

Not THAT young, I did take electric costs into consideration, just didn't know how much of that would cost me, because I'm new to bitcoin, and wasn't sure if I would make back that cost of electricity

It can't be too much time being wasted, since bitcoin is open source, I could just reuse some of the code right?

So I could legitimately develop my own site and "alt coin" and get free bitcoins, and people would mine those, increasing my coins until it flops, and I drop out?
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:40:34
So they would just process transactions that happen with bitcoin, and receive a portion of what goes on?

Ok awesome. One last thing: when bitcoin reaches its max (21 million I believe) what happens to bitcoin miners? Do they have to stop mining?
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:54:10
Damn, so I would need a dedicated miner?
Are there any good ones under 500 where I could make at least $5 within a week?

What exactly is alt coin? Is it just bitcoins competition?
And when you say they are difficult to predict, do you mean the value could greatly increase or decrease at any given moment?

Okay, what if I raised the price to $650 or $700?
Going to be honest, im pretty young, so I'm just trying to get ahead and start mining/trading/buying bitcoins so in the future i will be able to sell those once the prices increase (or use them as payment if more companies adopt bitcoin) 
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:49:29
So do you think they would be receiving more, or less than they currently are?
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:31:06
What do you mean by dev fund?
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:19:31
If I actually did that, and then the prices rose in about six months (say to $1200) then would it be more valuable for me to keep that bitcoin, or just mine it
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:59:15
But isn't the price of bitcoin rising to where I would make that back?
