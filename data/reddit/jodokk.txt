   Give it some time.  Some entities, which can't actually manipulate the market as much as they wish, are facilitating the drop of BTC value down to a point where the large funds feel comfortable to jump in.  
   That event "should" trigger a new launch, (with the inevitable adjustment for profit-takers, again), as more new, "average investor" money entering the space, evens out to a gradual rise.  
   What we hope to see happen is for that launch to take us past $15,000 or $20,000.  
   This Fall?  ...maybe, if the SEC/ICO bloodbath gains momentum, and more "convenient" remarks from folks like Gates and Buffet stay in the news this summer.  That should sufficiently FUD the noobs into hodl-mode, and roll the values down.  Or, I could be wrong.  What do I know?

Looks interesting, but who trusts Kodak not to burn the house down?

Pay Pal can, and has shown, that they can and will freeze, funds at their whim.

It would bring (real) privacy coins back to the forefront (because THOSE are what actually frighten the govs.  A quick look at the blockchain can tell them a lot about specific BTC addressees and patterns/amounts if the owners aren't mixing).  Breed a much larger underground market,   Slow down adoption.  At the same time, I'd bet institutionally issued (51% controlled) govcrypts-up very quickly.  But, I may be wrong. ��
