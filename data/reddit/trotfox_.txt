It's not named that tho
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:21:44
Also the fact that it doesn't degrade. That's huge. 
@_date: 2019-11-15 22:28:54
I respect your strength.
@_date: 2018-10-24 02:28:23
Waaaayyyy more efficient. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 02:32:23
Your stupid. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 20:21:13
Really? is a blockchain less efficient then what they do now?

Yea I've been doing drugs too.
@_date: 2018-10-24 04:08:09
Nope. Sorry you are wrong, just because it seems overkill doesn't mean it is. Right now there are about 6 to keep an active eye on just on binance.
Realistically you want to efficiently watch as much as you can. This is a great setup. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:37:26
I say 7k bounce off 5k as a new bottom then skys the limit.

Stupid mistake.

It is though. Try watching all that on one screen it fucking sucks.

Interesting, thanks for this.
@_date: 2019-10-10 06:35:55
Ah, ok man, think what you want, that's fine. But know that you are wrong.
I mean I could prove it, but that likely still wouldn't be enough for you. 
You assume an awful lot...I think that is how YOU would respond.
You can use it as successfully, I am not special.
Me responding says absolutely fuck all btw, shitty armchair psychologist assumption.
@_date: 2019-10-12 20:05:40
These are not lies, brother. It's following where the algos are buying and selling. Fib retracements on 4hr (minimum) and up combined with your major MA's, 10 simple, 21 ema, 55 ema, 200 simple, 200 ema, 377 ema. Trending above 10 and 21, it's bull, below, it's bear. 
You are not being specific enough, "TA screamed overbought" reeks of you not knowing what you are talking about. Momentum oscillators stay in "overbought" in a bull trending market....same the other way they stay "oversold" in a bear market, until they dont. They are MOMENTUM, meaning overbought just says, yup still trending that way. Use your major s/r levels to enter and easily manage risk at these levels.  
It's only 50/50 if you have no edge, that would be gambling.
No one said it's confirmed easy money, lol, again this proves you are ignorant to what TA is and how to use it, and there is nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:13:19
But what about the corkscrew?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:16:51
Haha. Mind blown when they realize it goes to eight decimal places.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:05:14
This. People who think like this are the same ones that don't understand market cap either.
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:09:19
Is fucking in heaven.

Shit, dropped my trezor.
@_date: 2019-01-23 21:39:56
I don't get why this has to be stated.....I honestly couldn't give a fuck. You're a dude into crypto on reddit? Cool. You're a chick into crypto on reddit? Cool.
It really doesn't matter, you're an anon online.
To anyone saying otherwise, negatively or positively, you're caring too much about something that doesn't matter.
Do women feel special or something for being into crypto and hanging out on reddit? I doubt it.

Yea but you didn't pay a lot more for the product. You got the product in 2013 and you paid in 2013. 
Now if they took the btc in 2013 and gave you the tv in 2017 well ya, that would suck. 
I can buy a tv today with fiat and if massive deflation happened I could be in the same boat. 
Using btc as a unit of transaction is not silly at all. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:27:43
Why *wouldn't* they?
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:56:34
I second this. Webpage would be cool. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:28:36
You didn't overpay if that was what it was worth when you bought it.

No one knows for sure if it will keep appreciating (I agree with you, but you can't know for certain). And again they're not overpaying, *you* are talking from a holding and speculative point of view. 
There actually is value in using it as a means of exchange.  
Say btc is the best option for a person to purchase an item. If they purchase said item and get what they wanted, that they would otherwise not have been able to do without btc. Is that silly? I mean they didn't "lose" anything. 


This doesn't make sense. It most certainly can act as a currency, and actually is right now for some people. It just isn't as stable as you're point of view thinks a currency should be.
And lastly, wouldn't more people ***using it as a currency*** actually be one of the main factors that would make it appreciate, since it would be fiat flowing in and out to make purchases, essentially?

It *is* about age, you mentioned it twice...
I don't have to experience something personally to learn from it either, that's what great about being human and having logic. You have an age issue with people younger than you. You talk down, embarassing.
When have the phone lines gone down long enough you couldn't get your money before you starved? When was the last time the power was out long enough you were physically suffering from lack of access to your bank account?
Again, you are leaving out the scale of your disaster. Are you talking about buying lunch for a day, when the power lines got knocked out for the afternoon or a long term power outage, in the sense of a hurricane?
Short term, your argument is moot. You wont starve in an afternoon, and if you needed a meal or to borrrow a 20 that seems reasonable, and no need to say BTC is inferior or debit for that matter.
Long term where the things are FUBAR, the guy with food don't care about your 20 OR your BTC....
BTW, no one is relying on BTC alone, because no one is using it for their main day to day. Everyone knows to have cash in an emergency. Most understand their food and water is worth more than any money in a disaster, and they wont sell it.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:38:55
haha wut?
Because I've learned to trade profitably it's survivorship bias?
Because I cover with options and futures?
Follow what the algos trade man. Don't be so salty.
How do you feel about retail traders in forex markets that make their careers trading, are they just lucky too in your mind?
Just because YOU can't do it doesn't mean someone else can't. Really not that hard to understand and make work for you.
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:57:40
Enough with the ageism, ya twat. Yes I remember. Even if I didn't, I could sure comprehend it. I get the feeling you judge a lot of character on age which means you miss out on a lot in life, sad.
Do you remember what you had for lunch yesterday, old timer (not very nice is it)?
Without power the tills now don't run, at all. They will SHUT IT DOWN, not take cash. In a minor outage you could still go to a neighbouring city with power still, grab out cash from there or purchase goods. Even then, if this is a prolonged outage, in 3 days nothing fresh is in the store at all anymore, anyway.
What you conviently leave out is the scale of outage you are speaking of, which would determine if CASH is useless too. 
"See guys, BTC is garbage we aren't even using it, I was right hahahaa" &lt;------ As you stand there with no clean water, food , and a handful of worthless cash.
Your cash isn't the life saver you think it is. 
You can also transact BTC without power or very minimal power as well, but you proably don't want to hear about that either since it doesn't fit your luddite narrative towards electronic money in general....
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:21:14
That's actually a great feature. 
@_date: 2019-09-03 20:21:17
Exactly. Also dont reuse adresses if your worried...

Bud, you got dismissed 4 comments ago with your lack of explanation you dismissed yourself.
Starting to think your reading comprehension isn't so great. 
Not a single answer.
@_date: 2019-09-09 06:16:45
It's not an issue at all.....
You miss how it works.
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:31:35
Which experience, being stuck with no cash? 
Your experience argument is a backhanded age argument as well.
I pointed that one out...you had no point other than the old meme "can't use that when the powers out...".
Don't want to expand on the specifics you are talking about?
Ohh, also seems like you ae assuming I'm overly emotionally involved, in one of these assets? Such an assumption and such a stretch if that IS what you are saying. 
You cannot even explain what I'm supposedly not understanding...other than vague shit. "Experience" "Do you even remember..." etc.
Your cash is just as shitty in any real disaster...just like gold...just like btc...just like your 7 shares of Amazon. 
If your argument against any money with an over 99 percent uptime, is it's minute downtime, might wana rethink that...(I'm referring to debit and credit here not BTC).
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:15:45
Next fork maybe?
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:42:19
Yes, but I thought you said it was quickly appreciating :). I guess defining quickly would help here. And people, are holding it though.... That's what the market cap is, no?
As a retailer I would make a point to change my btc back to fiat ASAP on a rolling basis. This would solidify the profits of every sale and at the same time use the (albeit, limited at this point in time) fungibilty to make that btc spendable anywhere. 
And yes in certain markets the supposed "risk" would be overshadowed by the reward of more sales, by far in some cases. 
Say you offload to fiat every 12 hours automatically. But the price tanks in that time. You FREEZE the offload to fiat (yes I know, a blip in the revenue stream sucks, and could sink you in tougher times). Since it is quickly appreciating you obviously need to hold for what ever amount of time "quickly" is to recover your sale, maybe even get out at cost without a markup. Just to eliminate that much more risk.
@_date: 2019-09-08 14:55:29
Haha, what?
What does that have to do with the BTC network, at all?
@_date: 2018-07-14 16:21:42
....written on a dollar bill.
@_date: 2019-09-08 14:51:08
Fitting if you bought at the top.

"lose it", BitMEX?
@_date: 2019-09-26 06:23:37
If you actually use it correctly, it works.
@_date: 2019-09-08 14:51:56
You can't have recovery keys on that without permanently exposing them.

You're preaching to him what he is already doing, that's a bad look. 
He's doing it right, pushing the extent these people can manage. So what if he helps one person and it doesn't work out to be more than one helped in the long run. He can't make those choices. His compassion in the first place will give the drive for them to help others, hopefully.
You are talking like these people are dumb or naive to their situation, they are fully aware. "Giving away money", is very very good in this situation.

Bro, if their isn't no power you're worried about food not currencies, gtfo.
@_date: 2019-09-27 06:29:22
Doubt all day, bud. Might as well just call me a liar and get it over with if that makes you feel better.
Who said it's guaranteed? It's not, obviously and doesn't need to be. You are proving you don't know what you are talking about.
You can never know with 100 percent certainty what will happen, THAT is tarded. And if you think that's what people who make money using TA believe, you are sadly mistaken.
