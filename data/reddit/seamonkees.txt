All the large bitcoin media sites ONLY put out negative news. WTF?
 Where are the media sites that push out optimistic good updates and outlook?
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:09:40
I should have been more specific and refer to the overall market.

This is why BTC needs some regulation, GOOD regulation made with the help of BTC core blockchain developers.

Happens to me Everytime! This transfer failed. This transfer failed. This transfer failed. This transfer failed. This transfer failed. This transfer failed. This transfer failed.

But why do we use $'s to price it if it is backed by blockchain?
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:36:38
That would be the better route for this financial instrument. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:34:45
What I get out of the article is. 
There is no good Crypto regulation that exists yet, so they will use old regulations that may of worked for old instruments.  **Kelley Loeffler** CEO of BAKKT gives their word like this "We agree to operate in a way that does not corrupt Bitcoins purity and purpose." BUT, there is no regulation that will force them to adhere to that. They could virtually run this financial instrument like the precious metals market is ran, a way that they could control the BTC market. There is no specific Cryptocurrency  "regulation" they have to follow.
 Bitcoin is a new frontier, it needs better updated regulations. We will see the some corruption and manipulation that is seen in the metals market, the market price per Bitcoin could be affected much much differently due to major manipulation.

How do I buy Bitcoin with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:17:30
Agreed! They should really stay out of the btc world.

"rehypothecation" and  "commingling"
Essentially creating artificial BTC that does not exist. Paper shares on an actual asset, which dilutes the real asset.   
**Pretty much, hugely increasing the supply which in-turn decreases the scarcity, which in turn decreases the demand.**  
@_date: 2018-09-16 03:08:04
Is that much different than 'belief' ?

What the hell does this mean. "The founder also promised that in addition to the common practice of crediting BTC holders with equivalent balances of the new coin (B2X), they would also receive “a proportional number of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoins as a reward for their commitment to progress.”
SO if I have 10 BTC I am getting another 10 BTC and also 10 B2X? wtf?

If America's military was  really inferior would the $ still be as global and popular as it is now?
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:36:09
EXactly. Paper shares of BTC can crash real BTC.

Every single security traded on the market is influenced by Unidentifiable Participants. The damn $ is influenced by unidentifiable Participants. Gold and silver is influenced by Unidentifiable Participants.
Do they truly think that they can identify every human on earth that influences the prices of things?

Bitcoin is not immune to huge sell offs too. Nothing is completely safe.

Then transform into a bull.

What it seems like to me is that Btc's higher fees and inevitably longer transaction wait times (days/weeks) will negatively affect the overall adoption of it. And for that reason I don't think btc can have anymore astronomical gains (yes and it has already has had large gains)
 Someone would be reluctant to start investing in BTC if they are told they have to spend a huge fee to attain that btc and then wait a week to receive that btc.
