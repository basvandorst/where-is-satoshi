I'll take option 3.  Don't forget about the increasing fees though!
However, as long there is only one btc chip producer, there is always going to be a monopoly.  The scaling is just one issue.

They where promoting the use of monero of obfuscation purposes on the onion subs. Notice monero is accepted by the biggest market...
Obfuscation isn't the point, fair and free trade is.

Oh yeah, I forgot whores, hacking, breaking confidentiality and money laundering.  Thanks.  I too like to avoid cumbersome laws.
You forgot pizza though!


On top, there are all the ICOs as well as projects like Plutus which aims to turn your smart phone into a credit card by allowing you to pay with eth any merchant as they convert it to dollars on the fly.

Then you should look into other coins too. There are exchanges. Think of them like stocks. The lower the price the more shares you get.
I'm not tech minded at all, but I've made a lot of money with btc by doing what u/3nelsola said. Since btc was at $550. A few minutes reading here and there is all it takes. I started 'using' btc when it was 120 and I thought that was a rip. At 330, I was like shiiiit, shoulda invested. At 550, fuck this, and never looked back.
For example, check out the price chart on ether. Going up, even faster than btc! There's a huge 2 day conference in New York tomorrow. This would probably be a time to buy some.
