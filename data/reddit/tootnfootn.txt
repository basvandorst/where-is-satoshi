If Ghash.io takes over the network and corrupts the blockchain won't people freak and move to fiat or ltc? Won't that make those asics valueless? It does not seem to be in a pool's interest to corrupt the blockchain (they can still steal from their miners). Please correct me if I am off...

Regardless of GHash's true intentions, what I have witnessed over the last couple of days is the power of the Bitcoin community. While a 51% attack is technically possible, It does not seem socially possible. It is in everyone's interest including the largest pools to keep the Blockchain legitimate. The potential backlash from the community to any pool making a move against the network is significantly more painful than the benefit of playing nice.  At this stage can anyone or group withstand the collective pain of the community pointed a finger at them?

Bitcoin is where all the innovation is happening.  Fiat does not evolve.  What will Bitcoin look like is five years? I think look at protoshares, coloredcoins or mastercoins for a clue. At the end of the day there is a lot of computing going into mining and processing ecoins and a lot of human innovation. Does Amazon Web Services have intrinsic value? Also fiat is boring+old+unchanging,+closed.  Bitcoin is innovation+technology+global community+money+open source. Which one of these options sounds like the future to you?

How do u figure?  A bitcoin is a bitcoin is a bitcoin.  This would ask the  same as regular insurance, does regular insurance destroy fungibility?

The task does not have to be trival, it should be vital - like what Gamer’s did for protein sequencing..  One could think of it like a worldwide mechanical turk project to solve global challenges.  The coin would probably need to have some percentage of the coins to be reserved for human mining instead of just machine mining. 
One of the challenges with the current mining ecosystem is that the coin creators would have to determine the human mining task ahead of time once, for the entire life of the coin.  This may not work because over time the human task may become irrelevant or ‘solved’.  It should be possible to crowd source the nomination and voting of the human task and change the task over time.
Right now, most coins are created with milestones that reduce the coin award per block over time.  For example, the Bitcoin award per solved block started at 50 coins per block at the first block solved, and will eventual reduce to 6 Bitcoins per block when block 630000 is solved.   The human mining task could evolve in a similar fashion - nominated and voted on by the coin community ahead of the block and adjust automatically when the milestone block is reached.

Yes around the office we have talked about captcha,  and games like   Perhaps the gamification of the mining can be a service layer on top and can evolve over time?

My understanding is that China does not want currency to leave the country uncontrolled. Almost all currency export happens through the Central Bank of China.  Chinese citizens can only export $10k a year or $50k a year for tuition and travel.  When 3rd party payment processors were allowed to do Bitcoin transactions it was easy for Chinese citizens to export as much as they wanted in the from of Bitcoin.  From this perspective all the Central bank did was close a Bitcoin loophole in a long established policy, not make a unilateral move vs. Bitcoin.
