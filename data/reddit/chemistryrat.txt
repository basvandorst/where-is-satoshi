Couldnt agree with you more man. But only if you knew the kid idk why he would do something too fuck up his entire life like that it just doesn't make since he had so much going for him. He was in college for computer science. But he fucked up and threw everything away being a dumb ass. Dumb ass isn't the word for it a fucking sick psychopath

What do you think
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:52:22
Okay please don't judge him or me. Especially me not knowin the things he told me were true. He told me for a very long time he was going too jail and I didn't believe him until it happened I put myself around a very dark character and often wander if it was the rite decision but like I said I feel really bad for the kid he was a really funny kid who had a lot going for him self and I don't understand why he would screw things up for him self.
He's the first one on the list tell me what you think...
