Yeah I haven't heard of any accounts being closed either, you might get flagged and questioned if you try to withdraw too much at once I guess..
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:37:21
Oh god, they're going to call it the Britcoin aren't they.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:32:55
So what happens with the tax on that? Zero now he has none? Or still have to pay the gains?
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:46:07
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:13:27
well fuck I hope they can keep it pumped till mine arrives on coinbase so I can dump it
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:54:45
Not gonna lie, almost shit the bed this morning when I woke up to 12.5 after buying last night, but we're almost back in business. Just wish I bought more at the bottom now
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:28:04
We can mate, starting Jan 1st. Let's hope they can keep it pumped until then
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:04:33
Yup they are making extreme gains on transaction fees, meanwhile were stuck here with a 3k drop unable to sell or buy
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:20:55
I thought this was BS but honestly after day trading for a bit, I'd have been better off just buying the dips
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:37:09
I mean I haven't lost. But I haven't gained the .05 coin I could have by selling last night and buying again this morning
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:00:49
GBP hit 9000
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:55:17
Wow a screenshot I'm r/BTC should've been enough to warn everyone? What a laugh
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:53:07
oh look, up 1k and still no buy orders
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:26:51
hey GBP is another 1000 behind the euro so get ready for it to happen all over again at 13
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:20:53
This is untrue. It's a percentage based on how much your taking,
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:29:23
Pulled out on the dip, and am ready to buy back in with .3 more coin than before. guess I did a good job panicking
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:50:49
GDAX just seems to be the most common round here, also has a great live updating charts with what's happening in terms of price &amp; buy/sell walls
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:42:53
It's experiencing a lot of activity right now and they've failed to handle it again, gdax is getting spotty now too
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:31:11
I'm assuming coinbase buy orders will open once they price is back up
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:19:52
This is coordinated with coinbase, they will profit off their own, and only let us dump when the price is down 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:47:17
I have given up multiple opportunities to buy thousands, as have many here, welcome
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:07:45
Just accept we're getting boned. Fuck coinbase.
I'm in other areas like you, it'll be Jan 1st before we can even think of transferring/selling
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:10:23
And it's a stupid name with no mainstream appeal. Why are idiots complicating this, with Satoshi, mBTC, uBTC? Do you people go out in the real world? Disney would use bits, Star wars would use bits, the mainstream would use bits.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:32:06
There's no transfer or sales in the UK yet. Glad you can
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:03:54
I think if it's over 10k at once it will raise a flag, as they usually suspect drugs or cash-in-hand work that's avoiding tax.
Are you gonna miss anything if you do 6 this month and 6 next?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:11:21
Yeah I've had it backfire many times, but also missed out on a lot of coin calling falls but never going for them.
Peace and prosperity to all that hold and gamble
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:23:29
It's so obvious this is what's happening, the big holders are in a group chat and deciding when to pump and dump. If I had bought in at the start of do the same thing, hell I still would, send me an invite to the dark web bois
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:33:06
I think bitcoin needs a rebrand / remarketing effort to make it mainstream. 
We need apps that people (mainly teens) can send each other bitcoin via, and to chop it up into "bits" that can be bought for $10  a pop so they aren't daunted by a freakin' 10k+ price tag
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:08:19
Kevin Rose had enough good will tomake a show after the Digg exodus?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:42:15
Yeah I got charged £17.50 for a fuckin transac fee today, ridiculous really. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:37:09
Same, then made another 200 at the 8k dip. More in 10 minutes flipping this shit than my day job
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:55:00
make $4  and that won't even cover fees.
you need to be moving a lot if you're gonna day trade or the fee's will kill you
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:11:08
ugh coinbase been fuckin' me!
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:17:24
why didn't you guys just sell half and see what the other half did?
speaking as somone who didnt buy in at 8.00, then 240
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:35:57
At the same time you gotta enjoy it while you're here dude, who knows what could happen. Sell 10% and have a nice holiday
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:51:24
I've got a bit more in coinbase but I'm just letting it sit there, if I transfer to my wallet I eat another transaction fee, and then again when I move it back into coinbase to sell it.
