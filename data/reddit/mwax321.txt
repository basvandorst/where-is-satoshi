I feel like the printed instructions are counter-intuitive. There's a button clearly marked "instructions" on the app, and the app should be designed to be intuitive enough for anyone to use it. The printed instructions would do nothing more than scare people away.

Well, since we don't require any personal info from you besides an email and a password, how do you presume we do that?
You financial info is just as anonymous as it is with bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:25:47
OK so that rules you out for signing up on ANY SITE, including reddit.
We are not trying to scam anyone. We are only making a tool for people to use.

I don't think that people have "become" careless about security. Our advice that people hear is just 50 years out of date. Keep your money safe, don't give other people personal info, don't take rides with strangers...
Your average person doesn't know internet security because we don't teach it...

Especially considering there are copy-paste authentication examples for EVERY WEB LANGUAGE.
If this wasn't an extremely important feature that is **extremely easy to avoid**, I would argue that getting it out fast is sometimes more important than getting it "done right." With this, there is no way in hell I would argue that.

Agreed. Lie, lie, lie, truth? No. Simplest answer is that Mark is lying again.

Are banks required to inform you that they filed suspicious activity or would this come at a COMPLETE surprise? I'm guessing surprise, considering they think you are a criminal and want to catch you in the act.

Kinda makes you rethjnk about all the DDOS attacks that shot the price down in 2012-2013.  Could have just been book balancing time at Mt Gox.

He's playing the role perfectly
@_date: 2015-08-02 00:20:42
While I appreciate your honest now, I need to ask: Where was your honesty 2-3 years ago when all of this was going on?
It sounds like you were in a hard position, but your inaction caused this lunatic to lose millions of other people's dollars. If everything you have said so far is true, I hold you partially accountable for the loss of everyone's money, as you seem to have known there were shady things going on, and did nothing to oust them.
I hope this isn't a shock, and I'm sure 1000s other people feel the same way. 
Thanks for telling us the story of your inaction, though...
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:14:23
No this guy is just as guilty as the rest. He did nothing when people were losing millions. Only now is he telling his story. Fuck that guy. 
His only response to every question was "mark was crazy and I just had to go with the flow."
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:16:04
You missed a few parts in that AMA....
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:27:40
Lol NDA???? He had no official job. He was using a fake name working there!!!!? This is laughable
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:12:11
Man I just experienced this. Bank was half ready to call the cops on a $5k withdrawal. I was just trying to buy a car. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 22:13:57
I think he has an actual mental condition. Judging by the way he handled things and how he understands the world.
He doesn't seem to understand or care that people lost REAL money. This all seemed like a game to him.
@_date: 2015-09-14 22:11:45
I pink sware promised to pay it back.
@_date: 2015-09-11 14:01:11
Right. So he would spend 10k bitcoin on like a car. Then all of a sudden 1 bitcoin was worth $200. Shit... Better fake a DDOS attack and crash the market so I can buy more coins.
I'm not saying he did EXACTLY this but it must have been a similar circumstance.
@_date: 2015-11-13 01:15:57
Thank you for that generic speech on truth and justice.
@_date: 2015-11-13 03:31:25
I am the hero this sub needs!!!
@_date: 2015-11-13 14:46:52
And just to follow up here...
I asked why he hasn't been convicted, a legitimate question, and you respond with this karma whoring nonsense about truth and justice.
Yes. We all know a fair trial is what everyone deserves. It is quite annoying that you brought it up like we are all 12 and don't know that. 
You could have just said 'not enough evidence.'
@_date: 2015-11-13 14:43:33
And just to be clear: I'm not saying truth and justice isn't important. I'm just saying its stupid you all are talking about it line we need to be educated. We aren't dumb. Stop acting like we are. We all know guilty until proven innocent. 
It's annoying that you all act so fucking high and mighty about it. All I asked is "why hasnt he been convicted yet," and you all give this speech about justice. It is annoying karma whoring and is not relevant at all to what I asked.

I just want to be clear as to what you're  saying: The owner of the company scamming people did more than other employees to try and fix things? And that means he's a good guy who shouldn't be locked up?

I think the author fails to mention that quantum computing will affect more than just bitcoin. Many systems will need to be rethought.

They don't really explain it very well. 
Who mines these bitcoins?
"Anyone can mine bitcoins. All you need is a computer."
How do you get bitcoins? 
"I can give you some bitcoins right now on the air if you want. You can send bitcoins to anyone for pennies. "
Much better responses.
