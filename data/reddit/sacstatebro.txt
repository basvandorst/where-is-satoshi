fair enough. and extremely unlikely, but there still is always a possibility someone finds a vulnerability or a method to reproduce hash collision which renders bitcoin completely useless. to the point where people are just giving it out for free for novelty.

This. If I were to guess (and anyone here would guess), I would say Bitcoin is going to go up. A lot more too. However, remember we are biased here. I would advise to keep bitcoin away from family. If they wanna do it on their own, that's on them. I never shill Bitcoin to my family just because of the idea of being responsible for putting them in financial hardship. It would be unlikely, but there's always that chance. In my opinion, that chance isn't worth it. Instead, I have all my money in Bitcoin and I'm okay with ruining my own financial situation :P

A really fair point. Even as a Computer Science major I'm not educated to know if this is something that can be built, tested, scale tested, and implemented in under a year with the current state the technology is in. It works in theory but there is always a chance it just can't be done in 2018. The timeline is super weak, and I can't answer that part (haven't seen any timeline). So we'll just have to say. I hope that as a community we can push for it. I really do think it will help.

Not to be a turd, but it’s not actually that easy. You have to forge a new genesis block, have some basic knowledge about merkle roots, point to new nodes for that new genesis block. I mean it’s super easy but not for someone without programming experience. This is if you want to create your own coin and not just a clone of Bitcoin.

That's exactly my mentality. At the end of the day, we are still blessed to have these extremely decentralized options. Comparing it to bank accounts is the best way to get people on board. Here's the difference, our "savings" would be completely decentralized. Encourage people to keep their "savings" in cold/offline/software storage, and they can keep their "spending money" in the likes of Coinbase, Blockchain, Square (assuming they enter the BTC space balls deep). There are also ways to remove some of the centralization in the off-chains as well. At the end of the day, we still are given wayyyyyyyyyyyyy more power than having our money in banks with this system. I think this is the mentality we need to have as a community.

People are losing faith in Bitcoin who have been long time supporters. Most of this is due to fee and scaling issues. The network is becoming a literal clusterfuck and it's something that, with a relatively large group of talented engineers, can be easily fixed. As far as "references" or if you're asking me to point you to a source for this. I'm not sure where to start.  
  
You can scrape Twitter for negative comments about Bitcoin scaling, cross reference those accounts and you'll see a large percentage of them were at one time a supporter of Bitcoin. Or, you can just look at the increasing Bitcoin network traffic and see a direct correlation with higher fees and slower transaction times. Or you can just look at the rising support for Lightning network and off-chain protocols in general. At the end of the day, almost everyone who supports Lightning network is very pro-Bitcoin. We can all agree that these protocols can potentially threaten centralization which is why we must encourage this "savings" account mentality of keeping your Bitcoin stash and storing it on the main chain in cold storage. The community is willing to compromise and even forfeit some of the centralization technology just to have a faster network.  
  
I think that's proof enough that Bitcoin needs saving. Now, don't take it so literally. When I say "saving" and "restoring faith", I'm not saying Bitcoin is on its deathbead and needs an emergency trauma surgery to get it back up again. I'm saying that it's very obvious that there are issues with the Bitcoin network, and a lot of people do not want to throw more money into it until it is fixed. The more these issues are fixed, it also helps with adoption. For example, STEAM removed BTC support not because they're against Bitcoin, but simply because the Bitcoin network was not a practical means of currency for their business. This right here is further proof that adoption can actually work backwards if scaling issues are not fixed. Again, there are charts that can be found with a simple Google search that Bitcoin's astronomical price correlates pretty well with its astronomical adoption rate.  
  
As far as the exact phrase I chose "restore faith", I'm not implying faith has been completely lost. Perhaps there was a better phrase I could have chosen. However, I hate English, I'm a terrible writer, and I'm a 21 year old CS undergrad. I do not mean that faith has been lost in Bitcoin, and we are trying to fight for it back. What I'm trying to say is that we can further develop the potential faith in future investors in 2018 if we make our network something presentable. Think of it like a pitch to a board of investors. You have this hot new startup and lots of people are saying good things about you; however, there are some VCs that are on the fence about your technology but have the highest paying term sheets. Wouldn't be appropriate to say that developing the technology further to please them would be "restoring their faith"? I guess that's the line of reasoning I'm going for here and I hope I cleared it up.

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:58
some of the technologies that were borrowed in off chain protocols and LN weren’t even invented 5 years ago. as far as utilizing more space on the blocks, we wouldn’t have known because you can’t scale test a network of this caliber until you encounter the scaling issue to know how to fix it.  
  
your question is valid so I’m not passive aggressive. but that’s like Honda releasing a 2018 car and someone saying “why wasn’t auto pilot in this car, like, IDK, 5 years ago?” . the technology was largely in a theory and testing stage.  
  
the whole off chain protocol is being developed now because:  
1) 5 years ago scaling was not a priority  
2) huge advancements in blockchain theory and technology since then  
3) overall a larger engineer base

hahahaha thanks for giving me a good laugh back then, bro :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:49:06


  
I never said that. I was talking about beginning the implementation of it. When I was talking about widespread merchant and consumer acceptance of it, I mean we must have a path to that. Right now everything is just computing theory with a couple fun little betas. Just the idea of its potential is all we need, and for off-chain protocols to be put into small-scale practice in 2018.

Thank you so much for actually taking the time to point me in the right direction. This is much much more helpful to me than flaming me right off the get-go. I guess I am trying to figure out an algorithm or a ML model that would try to make decisions based on a statistical level of confidence. While I know you can't reduce a decision to a 100% success rate, there are genetic models such as some that are in self-driving cars that aren't very deterministic, and errors can still occur (although very rare); I guess I am trying to find the right mindset and grasp this topic that I am self-teaching myself.

The fact that you already got information wrong means I can't (and no one else should) take you seriously. Straight from VISA website: "VisaNet handles an average of 150 million transactions every day and is capable of handling more than **24,000 transactions per second**". You for some reason pulled 400,000 number out of your ass. I even googled it to see where you were misinformed and it looks like you just don't know what you're talking about. Anyways, moving forward...  
  
Lightning Network will SIGNIFICANTLY increase the amount of tps (transactions per second), there is science behind this. With the volume that the Bitcoin network will have, yes, it's possible to pay for a coffee with Bitcoin. And yes, you are wrong. Sorry. Keep in mind, the Bitcoin network will not have the volume, or anywhere NEAR the volume of VisaNet and Mastercard for a very long time. This means we get to shoot to a smaller goal and fix our issues for a very long time without having to worry about scaling issues for a while.  
  
Also, my point was that implementation of off-chain protocols would promote further growth for Bitcoin. You simply replied with "No, it will not". You're so wrong and I take pleasure in saying this. Source: watch when it gets implemented fully. You'll see more aggressive growth with Bitcoin when it happens. I'll be sure to remind you when it does too ;)

False. People thought other hash functions were unbreakable; as time progresses, there is always a looming possibility someone much smarter than us can find a flaw in the hashing algorithm and be able to reproduce collisions.  
  
The odds you’re referring to are finding a hash collision by brute force. And I think those were just insane. Something like 1 in- however many atoms there are on the Earth.

@_date: 2017-12-17 02:32:47
There are good arguments as to why Bitcoin doesn’t need to. I even argued once that Bitcoin could thrive solely as a store-of-value. Fixing the scaling to where Bitcoin could support micro transactions just brings a new demographic to the currency, gives confidence to investors, and gives us one more cool selling point for 2018. Also, this is kind of a more cultish response; but in satoshi’s white paper his entire goal was to have Bitcoin be peer to peer electronic cash. His emphasis on day to day transactions was much larger than store-of-value. However, I’ll play devils advocate and also say that Satoshi could potentially be against the decentralized nature of off-chain protocols. I’m just covering all bases here and trying to side with the mentality that promotes Bitcoin’s growth. It’s an extremely tricky topic. :) 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:30:09
I guess there's not a select date. My guess is just an educated guess. They have the product built out, it's being scale-tested, and it's working for mostly everyone who's been using it. If I know anything about tech, it'll be out within 2 weeks :) As long as it's economically "worth it" for Square to keep this running. Because, at the end of the day, they're a business. I'm sure they'll figure it out though!
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:41:40

There are even some web wallets that provide these, but your best bet would be a hardware wallet, (you can get your private keys in the software that comes with them).
Like I said, I urge you to look into a couple bitcoin technologies. I probably shouldn't be saying this, but I keep my bitcoin on a web wallet as well (just for ease of access). I keep them on blockchain.info (be extremely careful, this web wallet is known to be targeted for phishing scams, even sometimes advertised in google). But, one thing I like about the web wallet is they give you your private keys in the form of a BIP39 Mnemonic. It's a 12 word phrase that represents your private keys. Once you own this, you write it on a piece of paper and you can stash it anywhere. You can then import this phrase into ANY wallet that supports BIP39. This now means you are holding your bitcoin. But like the other users said, this doesn't prevent blockchain.info from being targeted by a massive hack or phishing attempts. I just trust the company, and don't feel like it's going down any time soon.

Agreed. There are extremely powerful, rich people who won't just give up and let Bitcoin die. If bitcoin cash can cause a scare, we can bite back and come back higher than before. I think it's a big fallacy that if we start to dip a little, EVERY single HODLer in the world will just dump btc and make the switch.

Hahaha or like pushing the pedestrian buttons over and over to get the light to change. &amp; GDAX, only because it's generally higher than the others and it makes me feel better ;) Cryptowatch for the charting platform though!

I won't lie, I started off thinking of this as another meme; but, it doesn't sound like a bad life to live! Good luck with your spiritual journey :)

honestly just seeing it above 6k again makes me feel a lot more comfortable. Especially when I got in at 5414, I just want it to stay out of the 5s altogether hahaha

bitcoin is going up again. slowly but surely. do what you want, but if you want gainz you'll hodl and bust a nut when bitcoin hits over 9,000$ by Christmas

Honestly, I never knew the name of this song. Super catchy hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:52:28
Yup! honestly I have no issue with that. While I would love for it to be our precious bitcoin, the crypto space is a very vast space and there is room for competition :) Bitcoin for store of value, other coins for micro payments. It really does not effect bitcoin’s future, in my honest opinion
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:34:29
Gemini has just what you're looking for!

Congratulations on getting your first bitcoin! You're gonna love it here. Don't get sketched out when price goes up and down like crazy, just remember, we only go up here ;)
As for your question: Honestly, it's not that coinbase isn't safe. It's just like any other reputable Silicon Valley company (think Twitter, Square, Tesla, Facebook), so I doubt they're going to be running off with your coin; however, it is always vulnerable to attacks. When they hold your bitcoin, you don't posses those bitcoins. Think of it like a bank. You put your money in the bank, and you can't physically hold the cash, you only see numbers on the screen representing the value that you have stored.
People will shoot me for saying this here, but start off with learning how bitcoin works (specifically private keys), and all that. Right NOW your bitcoin is safe. If coinbase gets hacked within the next month, or exit-scams, I'll personally send you 0.01 BTC just because I'm getting cocky. 
When you learn more, and hopefully buy more bitcoin, you'll learn that you'll feel a lot better about actually HOLDING your own bitcoin. You would need a wallet where you have access to your private keys. The moment you have access to your private keys, those bitcoins become "cash in your pocket" rather than "cash in the bank"
Hope this made sense, and good luck!

beautiful! we're pretty much doing the same thing, it has paid off enormously for me :) good luck with the hodl!

thanks for the thoughtful reply! because of this, I'm gonna be researching hardware wallets! looking at the ledger rn!

You are correct but generally those are the power sellers with the insane rights. Sellers who aren’t as established have a hard time selling for anywhere close to that amount. Also, the thing that sucks is that Bitcoin ATMs have ASTRONOMICALLY high fees almost making it impractical or putting you in a position where you actually lose money :/ I’m almost positive there is a way to take advantage of this huge market difference on LBC though; I’m just not smart enough to see it 
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:43:23
If you figure out how to display it on the screen, I can write you a python script to pull bitcoin prices every 10 minutes if you want :)
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:23:49
Same exact as you, I also put 1k$ in but at 5000$/coin! the growth will be insane. hold forever!
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:41:58
I am! hahahaha
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:22:43
First of all get a wallet. Do research on wallets that are secure and don’t settle for an online wallet just because it’s “easy”. Then once you do so, come back to me and tell me which one you chose. I first learned about bitcoin when I was 16 as well and I feel like shit that I didn’t hold the 50 that I had at the time (I’m 21 now). Once you get all the basics set up, I’ll send you your first couple bits of bitcoin :)

hahahahahahaha if someone doesn't do this I will, and launch a legitimate thread on bitcointalk
