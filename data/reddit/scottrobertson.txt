The US is corrupt enough that it doesn't need other countries to do it.

You could use xapo.com. Their service has been incredible for me.
@_date: 2015-06-17 19:43:48
A lot of people don't care about that though.

Email made life easier for a lot of people. To most of the population, the current system is totally fine.

Googles TOS :p
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:42:04
He is talking about fiat exchanges i believe. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 01:39:45


How else could he justify the circlejerk?
@_date: 2015-06-07 19:42:57


So... basically every business ever?

You do lose most of your userbase as very few android users use F-Droid. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 22:14:51
To be honest, i would settle for faster transfers from USD to GBP at this point. It's horrible.
@_date: 2015-06-07 20:00:53
Isn't this against Google's TOS? Obviously you can just distribute outside of the Play Store, but your user base drops a huge amount.
@_date: 2015-12-12 01:56:21
That's what happens. When a company is small, they can avoid regulation because they are small and off the radar. But the data they collect is totally normal. It's just standard KYC stuff. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:50:44
Or move them to your multisig vault on Coinbase
@_date: 2015-12-09 11:42:27
Honestly, I don't think this is linked to Bitcoin. They probably just pushed the raid timeline up because of all the publicity he is getting.
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:36:32
To be honest, the main reason it's in BTC is because Bitpay invoices where generated in that :P
Changing the way it's displayed will make it much easier for you guys, and make things a bit cleaner hopefully. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 23:09:17
How do they plan on making money?
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:40:15
Yeah, "we don't use Google 2FA as it is insecure in that regard" really showed a total misunderstand of the whole 2FA system.

Once my node gets up to date, i shall snapshot that and update the image available on bithost. That way when people launch it, it will be fully up to date. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 11:14:49
Ok, SSL has been deployed. 
Had to change a few DNS settings, so waiting on them to propagate, and then i shall force SSL only. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:18:06
VPS, not VPN :)
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:28:44
It's for Android too. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 14:12:43
It's US only for some reason.
@_date: 2014-03-22 19:04:43
Hey, just quickly replying on phone to say that these prices are not fixed. The 30% is because I cannot convert to GBP from bitpay at all as the minimum payout right now is £1000. 
I am having to manually sell on exchanges for now, and its taking a lot of work. The % will drop, and I am open to discussions on what you feel is fair.  
@_date: 2014-03-29 20:51:46
This. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:32:00
Thank you :)
Last week I relaunched Bithost after rewriting it all from scratch to allow multiple providers. I am currently working on adding Linode, but just making sure i have all the numbers right etc before i go ahead with that.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:58:10
It's so awesome. Withdrawals are a bit slow due to them going via Debit Card (in the UK), but it's so much easier than anything else. Even better if you are in the US. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:54:03
I am going to run my bitcoin in the cloud
@_date: 2014-03-11 10:34:48
Jesus should definitely be nearer the bottom of that list. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:36:58
I personally would not use it as a wallet. It's main purpose is to act as a node to help out the Bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:30:57
I have just come across this too. You seem to have gotten off lightly though, Barclays charge £6 when depositing via my Bank Card :/
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:42:39
bithost.io maybe?
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:37:52
I am guessing, another 5? :P
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:51:53
What exchange rate are they using? It's not the same as Bing's (Coinbase). 
@_date: 2014-03-17 10:34:33
Awww :P
They do and they do not. Everything is a GET request, so it's very scary :P But they are working on API v2 which should fix all of that. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:44:47
Awesome, let me know if you need anything - support
@_date: 2014-03-24 09:06:57
For the people down voting this, there is literally no way around it being in my account. The only way would be for you to create an account, and give me the API keys, but then you would have to have a credit card in your account etc (making this pointless). 
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:19:15
SSL is on it's way :)
In terms of identification needed, no. But this does not mean you are free to do as you please (in terms of the law and our TOS). Your account will be shutdown, and servers will be deleted if you violate either of those. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:02:14
About 2.5% from Barclays i was charged. Which compared to spending 25 mins messing around with Local Bitcoins is much better.
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:34:00
You don't trust someone with your security because they don't know about an online currency? The 2 are not related in any way. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 08:36:12
Why? He wanted a PS4. That's like buying a cheese grater instead, it wouldn't help. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 11:47:45
Yeah, it's something I need to think about. I did double check with DigitalOcean on the minimum amount of info required, but I know what you are saying.
In all honesty, it's not anonymous by design right now, it's anonymous because I have not go around to deciding if/how i am going to do it. 
Like you said, legally I may have to report them, so I need to work that one out. Just not sure how yet. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:39:43
We are basically accepting Bitcoin using Bitpay, and then using the DigitalOcean API to create the servers in the background. It's quite a lot of work though. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:52:01
Wait until you get your Circle invite, so much easier :P
I had never really used Coinfloor due to their fees, but they seemed promising.
The reason they are backwards is because the people making the decisions don't want to lose out on any money. We love our taxes here, so they are probably worried that they won't be able to tax this as much or something.
Or they have been brainwashed into thinking all Bitcoin is used for is crime. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 14:09:24
@_date: 2014-08-17 00:09:49
Unless somehow you are not pulling from the same server anymore somehow. (Magic dns stuff?)
@_date: 2015-12-12 00:21:03


Do you genuinely think that? Or are you just joining in on the anti-coinbase circlejerk?
@_date: 2014-03-29 12:44:06
It's the same situation for basically any hosting company in the world. 
I do not have direct access to your boxes. The only way i could get in is to reset your password, but you would know about this right away. But that is the same for any hosting provider that i have ever used. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 13:52:55
Barclays and Cooperative. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:55:53
I have asked them in the past. They have said they are not interested in the consumer market.
@_date: 2014-07-13 21:13:02
Electrum 
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:54:52
I think this is more of a private sector decision. I am not sure the government has anything to do with it really. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:15:31
I wish it was available in the UK :( hopefully they can beat Coinbase to it.
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:03:49
That would be because you're wrong. But that's a discussion for another day/thread.
@_date: 2014-06-20 18:25:41
He is not the CEO.
@_date: 2014-08-01 12:37:20
People react the same to most subjects they don't agree with, or don't understand. I find the exact same thing happens when I discussion vegetarianism haha
@_date: 2014-09-22 08:00:07
That is only if you have a supported bank, which I do not.
Yeah, it is easy to buy, but I prefer both sides to be easy
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:21:58
Once you have an account, and toped up it's not. Those should really be prerequisites, not steps. And the last 3 steps are optional.
Just going by how they describe it here really:
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:38:12
It's not an advertisement, but he did mention bithost.io out of kindness for me giving him his BTC back :P This was going to be posted here regardless of bithost being mentioned. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:14:53
VPN !== VPS
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:50:44
No 2factor auth on exchanges?
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:40:54
You will do yeah. You get root access to the machine, and you can install any operating system that they offer.
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:42:47
The latter 
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:45:18
1. That would be against TOS, and it would be shut down
2. Some people like to help the network in different ways
3. Mining on a VPS CPU is just terrible. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:58:24
I will be posting the script soon, just tidying it up and making sure it's all ok :)
@_date: 2014-12-13 11:06:36
There are some risks to it, just like adding any payment provider. Those risks are not specific to Bitcoin though. 
Things like trust in the payment provider, reliability, accounting, tax etc.
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:54:53
I believe the title answers all of your questions
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:54:11
Yes, it's me :P
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:25:25
I imagine the only thing really stopping them is the fact that Bitcoin does not have recurring payments (you can do it with a Coinbase account, but that's not a good option for someone like Spotify). 
@_date: 2014-08-25 11:55:16
Unless it's what you set out to buy, then it is 100% correct.
I hate playing games on PC, i prefer playing them on a PS4. I give no shits about a PC being able to produce better graphics. I don't play games exclusively for the graphics. 
Just because you think PC's are better, it does not mean someone is wrong for buying a PS4. People consider more than raw power.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:14:32
So oddly it seems Barclays did not add the charge in the end, even though they told me they would. Just the 2.5%(ish) conversion fee.
@_date: 2014-10-22 16:06:48
Blockchain App with readonly addresses works really well.
@_date: 2014-12-11 09:36:11
I'll let people continue arguing while I spend my magic internet beans. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 11:38:06
This wont last long. Against Android and iOS rules.
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:49:40
You would probably be stopped before you even got to set the bank up :(
But yeah, i think they could block it. I believe most of the payments go via Bank of England, so they could just block it.
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:18:25
I figured i'd post this separately instead of continuing all the discussions in 
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:17:15
No problem :) I am planning on working on it over the next few weeks, so let me know if there is anything you need/want. Right now, we simply allow you to create servers, and reimage them. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 09:52:28
Cloudflare has been down over the past day or so in some areas, so it could be them. Probably not though
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:27:48
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:03:00
Even if that was true, it doesn't matter who created it. It's been rewritten multiple times over by now. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:46:23
Did you add an SSH key and it kept doing that? 
You will need to add one before you can create a server. I should add a message to that page to say why you are being redirected there. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:54:04
Sorry about that. Edited post :)
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:21:32
I think you should read into how Overstock/TigerDirect accept Bitcoin.
Hint: coinbase.com, bitpay.com
@_date: 2014-08-25 08:47:51
There is no logic in that haha
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:59:06
Terrible :P
@_date: 2014-03-22 19:16:24
The 30% is because I cannot convert to GBP from Bitpay at all right now as the minimum payout is £1000. I am having to manually sell on exchanges for now, and its taking a lot of work. The % will drop, and I am open to discussions on what you feel is fair.
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:56:20
Depends on your location. You will find it hard to do that for less than $1000 outside the US. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 10:36:09
Yeah, Barclays charged a foreign currency fee, which is £6 for USD. I even tweeted them to double check:
"Hi Scott, to receive a payment in US dollars we'll charge you £6 as well as the exchange rate for that day."
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:29:55
Buying it's very easy, but selling is certainly not as smooth.
@_date: 2014-05-05 21:46:02
When i say speed, I am talking about the length of time it takes me to create these images. I shall have one running constantly, which will be up to date, so i can just snapshot that ever so often :)
@_date: 2014-07-22 21:59:40
The prices are set by sellers. Nothing to do with Bittylicious
@_date: 2014-05-05 11:52:34
It could possibly work yeah. 
The reason for this being on the bigger machine is because we do the initial blockchain download via torrent. So it needs room to store the bootstrap.dat and then the processed blocks too. 
Without the torrent file, it takes way too long to build.
I shall look into it some more though :) 
You can see prices here: 
@_date: 2014-12-13 12:59:33
They make money through support plans etc (like a lot of businesses do). The 0% is not a promotion. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:47:55
thought this was to do with the Circle comments. My bad.
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:44:28
What's paypal?
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:17:37


It is a genuine concern, but people feeding children a vegan diet is not the issue. It's that they are feeding them it wrongly. Just like parents feeding children mcdonalds everyday is wrong. It's nothing to do with vegan/non vegan. It's about a balanced diet. 


The thing is, it doesn't. You can easily give your body what it needs without animal products. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 09:14:09
So awesome. I love when complex technologies are made simple enough for everyone to use. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:52:05
I don't think it is. Bing is reporting a different rate. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:36:39
You picked the 512MB size, needs to be at least 1GB at the moment.
@_date: 2014-08-15 09:01:21
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:11:33
I am not sure what they would achieve by sending you a code. 
The only code that matters is the one that (the real) Coinbase send you. Them (assuming a hack) sending you another code would not do anything, other than confirm you own the phone. The code would not work anywhere at all. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:15:33
Point me to this policy.
Every single bitcoin that goes into my Coinbase account, is withdrawn and sold. No sign of ban, no sign of anything bad. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:08:56
Ahhh right ok thanks :) that makes much more sense. 
I only pay attention to the votes when it's my own post really. It has always confused me why there where so many down votes for things that should not really have them (in my opinion). 
@_date: 2014-03-23 07:05:03
They are under my account. The limit is quite high right now on my account, and will be increased as i need it.
In terms of instance size, any size can be created.
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:13:01
Let me know their response. I have been waiting to get a foot in the door, this may be my chance!
@_date: 2014-03-19 21:37:05
Added :)

@_date: 2014-11-23 20:30:00
Awesome answer. 500 bits @_date: 2014-09-16 09:40:40
Not in the UK no. They only support US bank accounts for now.
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:10:03
I think using the word "scam" is a little harsh here. 
Of course there are cheaper alternatives. There are always cheaper alternatives. You can say exactly the same for literally any product ever, even Digital Ocean directly. Yet people have trust in them, and this is why the have launched over 1.5m servers. 
30GB... you can pick any size you want, i am not limiting you to 30GB.
I am in no way claiming this to be the "cheapest" way of doing things. I am simply providing a way to boot up a node easily.
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:16:55
Well, all I have taken from this thread is that Xapo don't understand that you can have a valid email with a + in it. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 01:16:48
Superior in what way? Does it come with a safe to put the paper wallet in? /s
Personally i use Coinbase multisig vault. It's secure enough for what i need, and comes with the benefit of not needing software. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:55:14
Getting expensive? Their prices have not changed at all.
@_date: 2014-07-31 10:58:41
They are hardly going to say "no" are they :P
@_date: 2014-08-25 11:37:03
But it wouldn't be better, he wanted a PS4... Getting a PC would be the wrong investment, even if it is "better". 
@_date: 2014-06-20 18:20:12
Unless they are about to hire him :P
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:31:06
That requires a lot of funding and a lot of time.

Security and privacy are totally separate issues. A lot of people do not care that Coinbase know who they are. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 22:35:56
There is no legal reason for them to require it as far as i know.
@_date: 2014-05-05 21:44:15
I do not know a single (good, none oversold) VPS provider that would allow 100% CPU usage. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:26:58
The prices are based on Digital Ocean's prices. I can hardly subsidise it by 10x can I?
Like i said, you can always get cheaper. It just depends on what you want to pay. Some people like Digital Ocean and want to use their products. You clearly don't, which is fine, but it does not make this a "scam". 
@_date: 2014-09-03 12:25:24
I am going to remove this post. I worded the title wrongly and it's creating too much confusion. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 14:05:13
It has a long way to go before the average Joe will have a need/interest for it. Just like the internet did when it first started.
Having complete control of your money is both a positive and a negative at the moment, depending on who you ask. For the average Joe its a negative because of the risks involved, which is why wallets like Circle are taking off.
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:35:39
Buying illegal products != policy against users selling bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:43:11
I agree, it is one of the biggest things that will hinder mass adoption. However, it is still possible to do that with our "normal" banking system these days. When making a bank transfer, they always warn you that if you input the incorrect details, it may be impossible to get the money back. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 15:35:50
The war
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:50:16
They give positive signals publically, but I can only imagine how much they hate the idea of it internally. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 11:38:09
It was using CloudFlare, but right now it's not. What worries do you have with CloudFlare?
I have some code ready to go that requests name etc on signup, but it will be optional. People like to stay anonymous for other reasons, not just because they are doing something wrong.
And like i said, if someone does something illegal, Digital Ocean will report them to me, and i will deal with them accordingly. I have no qualms with deleting someones server/account who is doing something illegal/against TOS. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:37:49
But very expensive 
@_date: 2014-07-31 10:57:12
It will be yeah. Huge companies like Dell will probably require a lot more account managers.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:33:01
We (bithost.io) have had to shut down quite a few full nodes due to them being compromised and being used to attack other servers. Not sure if there is a vulnerability in the software or not. So it could be that? Maybe not though.
@_date: 2014-12-13 13:43:26
Corner stores don't need priority support and dedicated account managers. These plans are for bigger businesses who can easily afford it and will still be paying less than they would in processing fees elsewhere. $300/month is nothing for a business.
@_date: 2014-11-30 01:13:02

@_date: 2014-11-23 20:37:42
Personally I think the only way the average joe is going to use Bitcoin is via a service like Coinbase/Circle. We may feel uncomfortable using them because we do not control the keys, but most people do not care about that, the fact that the account is insured is more than enough for them.
@_date: 2014-10-03 09:43:01
This is probably going to get downvoted to hell, but he is kinda right. The technology is much more important than the currency.
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:31:41
I personally do not see them as "ridiculously overpriced". You do, which is fine. But like I said, claiming that this is a "scam" is out of order. Just because you prefer the cheapest you can possibly get, does not make everything else a scam. 
It's not all about pricing though. For example, from the looks of it all of those providers you linked to do not bill hourly and do not let you delete and create instances when ever you want.

I can't remember if it redirected or anything, but i guess you could watch the network tab and the contents sent to coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:31:44
US only :(
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:43:52
I have spoken with DigitalOcean quite extensively on the subject. Using their logo is fine, since we are reselling their services. They are in no way concerned about me reselling for Bitcoin.
In terms of illegal content/spam etc - We will be reacting very quickly to any complaints from DO. If they suspect something is amiss, we will not hesitate to shut down services. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:00:02
And also, it works very nicely :P which is a bonus. Their Mac bluetooth app is awesome. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:11:06
That could work. I shall have a play around with creating a new image tonight. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:22:38
Yeah that makes more sense. There is still a small risk in that regard, Bitpay could still withhold payment for any number of reasons. Rare, but at big scale, still a problem.
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:30:51
Yeah, i got mine today and i was not charged the £6 that Barclays said they would :S
@_date: 2014-07-15 16:41:40
It's apparently updating quite often, so I am not sure. 
Plot twist: they are getting it from their own exchange :P
@_date: 2014-07-16 20:10:48
Bithost will have served it's purpose in my eyes when this happens :)
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:12:02
I totally understand why they do this. It's not anywhere near the same level, but most of the issues with abuse on bithost.io are from Tor users. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 19:07:56
Isn't a donuthole the middle bit of the donut? That would be comparable.

It's a UK tabloid, it's probably all made up.

Circle is fully insured, this would not be a problem. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 12:41:10
We should build an actual Bitcoin train
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:44:45
I have just switched the site over to using Coinbase instead of Bitpay. It feels like a lot better user experience, and their API is a lot nicer.
@_date: 2014-09-11 16:56:13
Exactly what Central Banks do, just with other currencies around the world. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 10:24:30
They learned that talking about this subject gets them lots of coverage.
@_date: 2014-12-13 12:36:52
Lots of people have BTC that are not early adopters.
Having choice is never a bad thing. Its a step towards getting rid of our need for banks too.

Linked discussion about bithost.io:
 
@_date: 2014-09-09 06:54:33
Well, why didn't anyone say!
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:23:23
Like catwelder said, email them :)
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:00:05
Apple do not care about Bitcoin. They just didn't want other payment methods on iOS, exactly the same as they would not allow Paypal etc. Google do the same, but are less strict. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 00:03:37
That would not work financially for either of them.
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:28:00
I think the main reason for them not expanding to the UK is because they have been concentrating on Euro market. There are a lot more countries who use the Euro so it makes more sense to go after that first.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:44:27
Thank you :)
I have been looking into Authy (or similar) to get that sorted. 
I have started work on it, but it may be a little while, need to work out the pricing etc for it and see if it's a viable option. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 10:21:28
Bitpay did give him the money back, however, if i wanted i could have simply accepted the payment into my account.
Believe what you want. If you think it's bullshit, simply don't read it?
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:43:26
Then that is why you had no fees :p
@_date: 2014-03-27 12:18:25
Done :)
@_date: 2014-09-19 14:09:38
@_date: 2014-11-27 00:21:42
I was thinking if Coinbase specifically. Someone would have to pay that fee.
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:55:13
And sometime it's you ;)
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:11:22
to the wall
@_date: 2014-11-18 20:06:41
Correct, but to make tipping viable you need a consumer facing product on my opinion. Such as Coinbase or Changetip
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:01:07
Yeah, I shall be doing so. Waiting for it to catch up now and then shall be updating the image. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 21:36:23
Just use a higher size
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:01:44
A warm fuzzy feeling inside :P
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:50:41
I am confused as to what you are getting at. Who had what equipment? 
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:37:52
We ( are looking into the possibility of providing a full Bitcoin node as a turn-key solution on our hosting service.
We would like to gauge what the customer appetite is for a service like this.
Would this be something that would interest people?

"I rather keep my money in one place and thats my bankaccount."
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:29:22
Yeah, exactly. It has been required many times over the years, so i can't really see them doing it anytime soon to be honest. I am not sure they will do it though, since they will want everyone going direct to build brand. Does not help in this situation though. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 12:44:29
It's basically a platform for surveys. Most of them direct from Google. I wonder if this is direct from Google or not, and if so, why are they asking.
@_date: 2014-05-05 21:29:43
To contribute to the network. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:31:47
Did you not get any fees? Or are you not from the UK?
@_date: 2014-11-16 13:45:15
Works fine for me in the UK
@_date: 2014-07-22 10:34:07
Yeah, you can't.

Thank you. That is the perfect analogy.

If you look at the transaction history, people are sending 0.0001 quite often. I have had it happen to me too, it's just people being annoying. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:52:07
That is correct, however it wont be 1 click, and you cannot pay in Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:43:44
Yeah, I mean for instance, when creating a server, that should not be a GET request. When deleting a server, that should not be a GET request etc :)
Edit: We do use HTTPS when communicating with DigitalOcean yes. The site will soon be HTTPS only too.
@_date: 2014-03-23 09:11:24
Some details on why they did it.
I like the fact that they said they will help people get started if need be.
@_date: 2014-08-25 08:44:24
But he wanted a PS4. He may already have a PC.
Also, some people (myself included) prefer the ecosystem of a console.

It really makes no sense
@_date: 2014-05-05 21:32:28
Interesting, i did not know this. I am adding more providers soon which will hopefully help that.

This is why i love 1Password. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:21:59
It does. I believe it's processed up until April 2013. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:49:20
They are just a hosting provider. Nothing specific to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:44:06
Bitpay is not a consumer product
@_date: 2014-07-22 08:25:04
Shame it does not let you add a billing address yet. Complains about not picking a state, and zip code being incorrect. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 11:52:11
That is a really good idea. Trying to work out the costs of doing that.
@_date: 2014-08-25 12:02:46
Unless it's the system you want, then it's much much more superior.
You could argue that a Ferrari is much more superior than a bus, but if you have 20 people to transport the bus is much more superior.
@_date: 2014-03-16 15:21:57
 - I set that up a while ago, it resellers DigitalOcean for bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2014-04-28 12:41:36
It's exactly the same as localbitcoins really.

I shall have a bash script soon that you can run on a VM yourself :)

Have a look at Local Bitcoins or Bittylicious :)
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:12:32
Or you know, they just do it himself because they believe in the company?
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:39:32
I realise that, but as far as Stripe are aware they are new products so they are correct to question it. If, once they know they are second hand, they carry on then we have a problem. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:25:28
They are clearly spreading FUD on purpose. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 19:45:00
Didn't realise you could actually buy them haha
@_date: 2014-09-16 10:11:26
This is on top of the "processing fee" added by the bank at the time of them receiving funds in USD. Not a lot Circle can do until they start transferring in GBP or start using Direct Debit system. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 08:17:55
I shall get this setup and hopefully provide a 1 click setup of this at  by tonight. Should make things even easier. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:48:26
Have a look at Authy. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:27:04
Could you point me to an article about that? I could get it added to the image hopefully. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 10:25:34
We can on longer view the verifications page etc. This could potentially mean they are prepping for launch, or have decided not to launch in the UK?
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:14:21
I find it very odd that VPS companies even mention hardware fees, or upgrade fees. Seems crazy to me. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:40:25
And how do i pay my hosting bills from the supplier?
@_date: 2014-03-27 12:19:01
We have switched to hourly billing, so that you do not have to pay for a full month anymore :) This means you can spinup and delete servers when ever you want. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 10:07:54
Because there was no "launch". It started out online to show a few friends, and get some feedback, and then people started using it.
If people run illegal activities, then they will be shut down, not me. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 11:38:28
They do, it's the whole business model. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 21:30:04
Shall get that added tonight :)
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:45:15
The URL would still be google. They got rid of oAuth v1 for this reason.

To the consumer, it does not matter what the business does with the currency after we send it. Does it matter that companies convert £ to $ in the same way? Are they not really accepting £?

@_date: 2014-03-30 10:53:58
Don't get me wrong, it's still an issue, and i will work with Digital Ocean as much as i can to resolve it, but I am not sure how much can be done.

A lot of companies that have unlimited holidays also have a minimum holiday amount. It's around 25 days in the UK.

And generally have a minimum holiday amount too.

Google Ads. It's hardly an endorsement from Coindesk. They can block the ad, just email them and I am sure they will. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 15:28:01
Same as purse.io. people selling gift cards etc for a slight premium.

Most of these are direct from Google. I am wondering why they are asking it.

I think the wallet fraud stuff will be outsourced.

@_date: 2014-03-23 09:10:44
You are correct :)
@_date: 2014-05-06 09:22:19
It's due to images/sizes being disabled in specific regions by Digital Ocean. Working on a system to display those errors better instead of making it look like it's our issues. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:09:20


Lol, what are you even on about? Does that mean every time i send BTC to anyone at all, Coinbase are going to sue me because i stopped that person from buying them via Coinbase?
You cannot have a policy about customers doing what they want with their own money that has absolutely nothing to do with Coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 12:54:33
UK too
@_date: 2015-05-15 00:37:46
Yeah, it did, bittorrent doesn't exist anymore. Oh, wait. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:32:36
Because it takes quite a lot of time. 
- Enable selling
- Wait for someone to buy
- Wait for them to say they have transferred money
- Wait for bank to clear money (can take 20 mins, depending on banks)
- Generate auth token using their awful php script
- Done 
Compared to:
- Click withdraw
- Type amount
- Type code from Authy
- Done
@_date: 2014-03-25 11:18:22

That^ :P
@_date: 2014-07-22 10:34:53
Good work!
I really hope they do better than Bitpay with the £1000 minimum payout for merchants. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 12:38:33
I didn't mean it as an insult. But selling BTC for fiat and buying stuff with that is not living on Bitcoin. All of us could transfer to BTC when we get paid, and then sell the bits we need to buy stuff.
@_date: 2014-08-01 12:35:19
I forgot some counties don't have this. We have had it since 2004 in the UK. Much better system
@_date: 2014-12-11 09:28:46
Why does it matter what they do with the BTC after we pay with it? Just the same as it does not matter that they convert £ to $ for instance after we send them £.
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:40:13
Shall update the post, the minimum was due to the image size, not RAM requirements, but you make a good point. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 11:49:15
So cool :) I don't really go to starbucks at all, but maybe i will start going there for tea in the mornings instead. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 01:07:43

Could we not pay them loads of money to pass a law to make it illegal? :P
@_date: 2015-05-09 15:33:49
Someone tweeted something interesting yesterday. Some browsers now require SSL for certain things, but you cannot get an SSL certificate without approval from a company. So they could literally stop you having a website. Obviously you could use a different browser, but for most people that is not going to happen.

Neatly 20gb i believe:

Referral program (earn 5% of every topup):
@_date: 2015-05-29 09:29:56
I don't think many people are happy about it, i just think most people don't care enough to make a fuss (like any country).
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:43:58
They have used the word for quite some time now on their mobile apps.
@_date: 2014-12-18 12:49:22
Where is the evidence that they are not all over it? Google could just be slow at reacting.
@_date: 2015-05-15 09:37:38
It's a choice not many people have. Also, i drink tea + soy milk, so it's ok, i don't have to deal with their shitty coffee :D
@_date: 2015-05-29 09:27:23
They will make money from the conversion rate like Bitpay do. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 11:32:49
Where do you live currently? Give it a try in your country too. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:23:12
You make me sick!
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:59:23
I must say, i have had no issues with Stripe at all. They are better than all alternatives that i have tried. 
To me, it just sounds like they doing their job and confirming you are allowed to sell the products, otherwise they could get themselves into a very horrible legal situation. 
As for not replying, I cannot comment, i have never had to contact them (other than the dev team, which understandably took longer). 
@_date: 2016-03-26 10:01:55
So... Coinbase Multisig Vault?
@_date: 2015-05-15 09:36:21
Google are changing this at Google I/O apparently. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 22:17:32
They are a fraud prevention service, making it obvious makes it easier for people to try and prevent detection.

@_date: 2014-05-05 15:32:36
It works, but our's uses a torrent to get the bootstrap file, speeds things up a huge amount. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 12:09:00
And  redirects to

They could just integrate with Coinbase or Bitpay. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:26:12
Credit reports can be used to verify the identity of people too, not just credit scores. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 08:18:15
The second key is encrypted client side. They cannot spend your money. Research before spreading FUD

I am not sure why Microsoft would buy the biggest competitor of a company they just announced partnership with. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:50:57
Officially yes. But they do allow customers from outside the US to use it, and it does work well. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 09:36:47
All seems reasonable. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:29:02
:P For bank accounts it is, but you can do deposit/withdrawals via Debit/Credit Cards anywhere in the world. 
It worked out at about 2.5% from Barclays. 1.6% VISA conversion rate, and then their fee on top.
They told me it was going to be £6 none sterling transaction fee, but that didn't happen (double check on phone, they said it wont be applied)

Sadly Pull payments are required by a lot of services. It's something Coinbase has to support to be able to get these businesses onboard with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:52:07
Although, that was posted after this thread, so they could have learned it here. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:15:46
Their banks could be pressuring them, governments could be pressuring them. 
Regardless of all that, I know I would like the ability to find out who my customers are if needed.

App is not out yet. Web based only until it is. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:40:38
They can't have it both ways. They can't say Bitcoin is not a currency, and say it requires a money transmitting licence. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:32:09
Exactly. For most people, having the banks control and track every single penny is not an issue. 20% of at Starbucks however!

Uber's UX works like this:
* You open the app, and call a car, and select a destination
* You get in the car, they drive you, you get out
That's it. No need to fumble around with paying people, getting cards out etc. It's all done in the background. That can only be done with pull payments. Well, no, you could do it natively, but it would require you to "top up" your uber account, which is just the same as topping up your Coinbase account. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 12:36:43
Without open sourcing the app, there is no real way of proving that. Just like most of the apps on peoples phones. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 11:54:24
But they are all pretty self explanatory. Contact + SMS + Identity so that they can use the new feature to send bitcoin to any of your contacts.  Wifi and device info will be used for the account validation features. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:50:47
Unless, like a lot of people use blockchain.info for, it's just watch only addresses.

Google Wallet is perfect for Bitcoin. When you use Google Wallet to pay for stuff, you can select which account it comes from. Bitcoin could be one of those accounts.

It's a bad way to look at it. Do you really think the insurance companies are going to absorb those losses? The banks? No, they are passed on to us in other ways. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:26:45
Bullshit. There are laws against informing the customer they are being investigated. I have friends who work at banks who have had to lie to a customers face because of it.

@_date: 2016-03-27 12:37:03
They store the encrypted key, which can only be decrypted with the password. You cannot decrypt it with a hashed password. 
They have no control over the 2nd key, and they cannot send/withdraw anything without you typing your password in.

The issue for services like Netflix is that using Bitcoin requires user interaction to pay. With the current system, they can just pull the payment, and the user doesn't need to do anything. It's much easier to get stable revenue.

@_date: 2017-01-26 18:13:10
No it isnt. It was a white paper on how to create a decentralised currency.
Fiat is fine, and it's what 99.99% of the world uses at this time, of course there is going to be cross over between BTC and it. Bitcoin is about choice, and if people choose to spend their Bitcoin via a fiat card, then that is fine.
@_date: 2016-12-08 13:01:37
Nope. Again, learn before spreading FUD.

There are lots of points to Bitcoin, this is not the only one. Trustless transactions are the biggest point for me.
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:01:15
You could say the same about any wallet software out there.
@_date: 2016-12-06 17:53:03
I suspect is using their vault, which even a hacker could not take bitcoin from.
@_date: 2016-12-06 17:54:53
In terms of Coinbases Vaul, what is insecure and unsafe about it?
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:36:52

@_date: 2016-12-07 18:59:02
Just to clarify, i don't want to sell hosting from the business, i want to sell the business. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 09:54:12


I did, and that is still true. You just didn't read how it works, or who owns the keys before trying to spread lies because "Coinbase is shit".
Coinbase is a hugely important part of Bitcoin, it allows people to easily get involved in it, and it's a good on and off ramp.
You may think that Bitcoin is all about 100% privacy, being anonymous, and being your own bank, but to a lot of people, that is not the interesting part of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-06 18:54:25
Nope. They only have 1 key out of 3. You need 2 to be able to move any Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-06 20:32:28
Wrong. Even if Coinbase went down entirely, there is a tool on Github to get your bitcoin out of the vault. It requires no interaction from their servers. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:52:26
Sounds to me like your in favour of choice and freedom, but only when you agree with that choice. 
Surely someone who owns all the keys, but uses coinbase is just as much their own bank as you are? What makes your software better than other software?
@_date: 2016-12-07 06:56:56
Yeah, that's not how any of this works. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:37:46
Sure, but even if they deleted your account off the face of the earth, you still have access to your vault wallet. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 12:42:59


Conveniently ignoring the entire conversion above about how Coinbase does not control your funds when using the vault. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:27:36
Given that there are 3 keys, you own 2 of them, and Coinbase own one of them, that would be impossible.
Please read how things work before spreading FUD. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 07:37:18


@_date: 2015-08-22 17:06:04
LocalBitcoins take 1%. It's also not instant, you have to wait to find buyer/seller, wait for the money, then confirm it. It's fine, but it's not comparable. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 06:52:20
The on and off ramps are going to be like the current system. They are built around it.
Protecting against losses is pretty normal business practice. They would be idiotic to not charge fees and ignore the cost of chargebacks.

I hope you don't mind me posting this. I did check to see if you wanted it kept private or not, but i could not see anything anywhere. 
I have submitted some feedback regarding the verification process. Hope it can be resolved :)
@_date: 2015-08-22 11:53:56
Probably just because they are just starting out. You are a beta tester, give them feedback ;)
@_date: 2015-08-22 05:35:29
Looks like the limit is £100/day
@_date: 2015-08-22 19:59:05
It's in the post body.
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:25:48
It's hard to tell - we can either use wire transfer (£30) or SEPA. SEPA can be free (depending on the bank), but they hide fees in the conversion rate.
@_date: 2015-08-22 19:59:47
Having looked at it, it was trying to get me to confirm a card i must have added a long time ago. The card i added today seems to have verified automatically.
@_date: 2015-08-22 11:54:47
Yeah it is awesome for here. I still need a good method of selling though. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 19:06:45
It's invite only. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:29:56
Yeah. This is not designed to solve that issue. The only solution to that really is Faster Payments.
Withdrawing to your card is just as slow and as expensive as sepa sometime, so you may as well just use that. 
Personally I just sell via local bitcoin at the moment. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:24:07
Have you tried circle.com?
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:32:17
The fee is 3%, so they are going to struggle
@_date: 2015-08-22 08:04:03
It seemed to be costing me £0.03 to buy £1 worth.
@_date: 2015-08-22 20:50:09
Of course you can transfer it out :P what would be the point otherwise?
@_date: 2015-08-02 20:47:13


This is exactly why Uber have not added Bitcoin integration.
@_date: 2015-08-22 11:57:14

@_date: 2015-08-22 20:50:21

@_date: 2015-08-25 16:44:38
Can you explain how you buy your Bitcoin with your Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-22 08:12:01
UK and Spain at the moment sadly. They are just rolling it out to a small group of users.
Have you tried circle.com?
@_date: 2015-07-11 09:29:49
And then about 20% to those who cause war, the government.
@_date: 2015-08-13 11:37:01
Then use Bitcoin. Coinbase is an on and off ramp, or for people who feel comfortable using them. If you don't like it, don't use it. But it doesn't make it "not awesome". They are awesome for a lot of people. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 19:06:25
They charge your card and you have the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 12:13:50
It's buying only. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:02:58
However, you do need to be able to convert fiat into Bitcoin. So in a sense, you do need permission to use it.
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:14:17
They would have a hard time getting me to leave my job :p
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:23:48
They are indeed. But the main reason will be to help UK/Spanish customers. The banks over here will not allow them access to the faster payments network.
@_date: 2015-07-28 07:31:07
It's a nice idea, but sadly it's not going to happen. Apple are all about making a huge impact in a market. They are not going to go into a country with a single provider, backed by Bitcoin, it would make them look weak. They will go in with the support of most of the banks, or not at all.
@_date: 2015-08-26 18:41:59
@_date: 2015-08-22 08:13:28
Exactly :) this sort of stuff is critical to getting more people involved. People bitch and moan about Coinbase, but they are necessary for the growth. Most people do not want to have a hardware wallet, and 3 paper wallets split over 3 locations. They just want a simple wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:21:40


Sorry, but this is bullshit. It's a marketing website, nothing more. There is no need for it to require SSL. And the email form is just Mailchimp (which uses HTTPS).

Soooo it's like  ?

@_date: 2015-08-26 13:51:30
It's slow as shit though, and expensive.
@_date: 2015-08-22 19:07:13
You can do it with lots of sites. That's not the point. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 06:34:48
This is not a negative thing. Staged rollouts are pretty common.
If they rolled it out to everyone, and it wasn't tested properly, then everyone would complain. I have already found issues and reported them. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:16:48
I believe the £20 limit is not relevant when there is a 2 step verification process. For example, Apple Pay requires a fingerprint, so is exempt from those limits (although they are choosing to stick to them right now). 
@_date: 2015-07-26 21:50:13


Obviously. I think everyone here understands that.
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:43:20
Obviously i meant for most people, not the 0.00001% that are paid in BTC
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:19:18
It's just a shame there is no money to spend :P
@_date: 2015-07-11 12:50:49

@_date: 2015-08-22 16:37:56
Sounds like it solves all your issues.
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:49:40
1. Just use your debit/credit card.
2. You don't have to. Just click "Don't see your bank listed?" at the bottom.


I don't know about in the US, but that is not true in the UK.
@_date: 2015-08-22 20:55:52
It's just the vocal minority. Most users have no issues. All/most of them issues are just anti fraud measures that are sorted out within a few days.
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:34:06


It's because they use Coinbase in the background. It's also a 1 man project.
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:38:25


Unless you are a charity, existing in the real world, in which you need £ to be able to operate...
@_date: 2015-07-12 00:12:58
I would say Circle is simpler to use. Most of my none techy friends have found it much easier to pick up. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:18:19
On the site: 
@_date: 2015-08-22 08:37:18
 
Basically, you verify cards by doing a authorisation, and then never claiming it. But for most banks in the UK, this will never appear (as most don't show pending transactions), and we will have to call the bank up to find it out, and even then, they sometime don't have reference numbers etc visible. 
Paypal get around this by just charging £1, and then adding that to your balance. Coinbase should do something similar.
@_date: 2015-07-26 21:49:30
How would that work? Apple Pay is closed
@_date: 2015-07-13 06:16:53
Assuming you are in the US then all that is true. Out of he us? Have fun waiting 4 days for anything.
Also, circle let you buy a lot more than that. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 10:27:07
They also go to your parents house and ask what you were like as a child. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 07:41:52
Yeah... 3% and an unknown exchange rate. When you can get cards now with 0% and that use the base rate, then using this abroad would be silly.
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:53:30
Neteller don't let you fund the mastercard using Bitcoin though.. they disabled that like 3 days after launch
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:13:50
Did you read the original post? It's not available to everyone yet. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 05:42:43
When did i say it was? I just said people find circle easier. Add a card, and buy BTC. Much more common purchase path for things online.
@_date: 2016-02-28 16:38:48


You do if you want to buy more than $300/week
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:32:52


Perhaps things have changed since you created your account? Shh, don't say anything!
@_date: 2017-04-24 11:16:59
I am in the UK. Revolut, Monzo. Just a few here. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 22:43:00
Transferwise would probably save 80% of those fees.
@_date: 2015-07-27 23:54:34


Sometime it's not about intelligence either. A company like Coinbase is insured. That is enough for some people to be fine with it.
@_date: 2016-02-28 19:01:54
It disappears once you do it. It's perhaps not present for older accounts.
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:47:45
Have you tried contacting Coinbase or Simple?
@_date: 2016-02-26 18:08:28
@_date: 2016-09-03 23:13:29


Yes. Basically all Bitcoin companies that offers cards use Wave Crest. They are problematic in some situations as they are prepaid cards, and at least their UK ones are registered in some odd offshore place.
@_date: 2016-09-13 20:44:43

Something like keybase.io would be awesome for this. Not sure how good their bitcoin integration is, but it could work well.

@_date: 2015-04-29 00:47:58
Yeah, i was just speaking to support about that. You are going to lose a bit in fees though are you not?
It will be good when the exchange lets me use it and stops thinking I am in the US:  (Support ticket created already)

It's the other way that's the issue, withdrawing. I will need to buy BTC, then sell it again into my EUR coinbase account, and then withdraw from there. Withdrawing from GBP coinbase account costs £30
@_date: 2015-04-29 14:32:33
Personally, because i use their merchant stuff so it's much easier. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 08:26:48
Yeah, it is stupid that they control it. Hopefully someone can step in and help the situation. The latest Budget did put a lot of pressure on FinTec stuff, so hopefully it helps. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:15:39
I am hoping that Android Pay will mean that we don't need to worry about anything, and that just works with everything :D

Really awesome idea. Is this going to be wordwide? Or just US? 
I am from the UK, which has a lot of these terminals, give me a shout if you need some beta/alpha testing. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 01:00:27
Being a fraud detection company, they are probably pretty vigilant :P
@_date: 2015-04-29 01:01:54
It'd worth noting that Coinbase will send data to them in the backend too, not just using Javascript. You send payment methods (not card numbers etc), addresses to try and find duplicate accounts, and to work out who is going to fraud you before they can even do it. It works very well i must admit. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 07:39:34
They seem to be stepping towards it, but i guess they want a solid partnership first.
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:28:52
Except that.. it's new to Coinbase. No one said it was the first time someone has ever done this in the UK. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 09:33:59
As far as I know, Google outsource most of this stuff to external companies to do processing. So it could be them being strict. They are probably run by the banks.
@_date: 2015-04-29 01:03:30
I know how SEPA works. I don't care how they send it, all I am saying is that it was free before, now it costs £30 using wire transfers. I am talking about the EUR/GBP accounts on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:55:16


That's fine, Dennis is on it :) thank you though. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 22:09:16
Reverse if you are depositing into Coinbase yes, i am talking about withdrawing. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:37:39
The latter probably explains the former :P 
@_date: 2015-09-23 15:48:00
Looks pretty good
@_date: 2015-04-29 08:21:01
I know you guys don't like Ripple Labs, but they are going to do a lot of good for the current payment networks. Yes it's centralised, but for now centralised is a reality that most of the world need to deal with, and it would rather that reality was fast. 
Edit: Based on the downvotes, you guys want bitcoin or nothing. The reality is, it's a long way off. So this is a good stepping stone. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 09:43:03
If he/she owns 1.5 million BTC, then good on them, but they have no control over the technology.
The code has been rewritten many times over since those days, so any hidden agenda would have been found out.
@_date: 2015-04-29 07:42:22
No SEPA. Wire Transfers only for GBP account
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:54:29
Hopefully US catch up very quickly with the roll out of chip and pin.
And awesome, that would be good. I run bithost.io, so just let me know if you need any help on that side of things. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 08:28:09
I'll just post their blog posts instead then. They are paying for a hackathon, it's good info for the community. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 09:17:17
Yeah. Most of the work they are doing will not be technical. People on this sub cannot see past that a lot of the time. Just because something is technically possible, it doesn't mean a company is going to just use it. It takes a LOT for a company like Western Union to do something like this. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:35:47
There is no physical card that i know of. 
@_date: 2015-04-11 21:57:55


@_date: 2015-04-29 08:10:34


Also, you are talking about deposits, I am talking about withdrawals from Coinbase. Sending SEPA normally costs yeah.
@_date: 2015-04-29 09:02:28
Work with people like Western Union. There is no one offering the same as what ripple offer using Bitcoin. Companies like WU don't want to have to integrate Bitcoin their self, they just want a solution they can pick up and go with. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:59:28
There is an alternative. Transfer it EUR coinbase account and then withdraw. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:59:15


And how is that a Coinbase/Circle issue? It's the users issue. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:52:51
Same. I have tweeted them about it.

In the long run, this is a valid question. But right now it's not the point. They have probably made a loss on the whole sale due to time spent setting it up and researching. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 08:03:56
When withdrawing from a GBP Coinbase account, it's the fee charged by their bank. We cover the cost. 
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:46:27
HOW DARE YOU INSULT TESTS!
@_date: 2015-04-29 08:09:55
This could be a good sign for Coinbase and the likes. Faster Payments inbound if the other banks play ball. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:52:06
Chip and sign is not better for anyone in anyway.
Chip and sign will be an option (like it is in the UK) but chip and pin will be preference. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 07:19:47
You said a typo. An unspendable address would be one hell of a typo. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 19:18:52
I don't have enough experience with them to answer that confidently, sorry. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 09:04:52
It does, but there is then the £30 fee for Wire transfers. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 10:03:25
Even if that is the case, i personally do not see a downside :D there is no way they can control it etc
@_date: 2015-04-26 09:10:55
Even with those 5 people merging stuff into master, if people on the network don't adopt that merged code, it will not make a difference.

Founder of bithost here. It's something we have looked into a few times but the complex pricing structures make it very hard to do. 
Interested to see if you find anyone doing it.
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:12:42
Can i get an address please?
@_date: 2015-09-07 17:08:38
We are capable of focusing on more than one thing. Block size is required for long term growth, and at this stage, changetip is much more convenient for tipping on reddit. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 17:17:26
It could be done on the blockchain, so why don't you do it? 
It works because sometime centralisation like this is good. Being able to just login with all my social networks, and be able to tip on lots of sites without having to ask people for addresses etc is nice. Centralisation is not the devil, sometime it's required when finding the balance of convenience. The good thing is though, you don't HAVE to use changetip, so don't. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:26:27

@_date: 2015-04-12 17:21:03
I don't mean to be abrupt, but it must have taken you more time to type that than it would to Google it. 
They are similar to Coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:35:14
Most software won't let you send to an address that is invalid.
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:29:19
Just wire actually. Doesn't let you use SEPA
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:37:38
Does this mean that the US Government now accept Bitcoin technically? /s
@_date: 2015-04-29 07:40:22
Wrong. We can use EUR coinbase account with Sepa payments, which is free for most banks in the UK. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 07:41:12
*if you don't mind paying the £30 fee with withdrawals. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:53:32
It's a Coinbase invoice. You can choose to pay it in BTC directly, or fund it using your bank account. It's not a page specifically for buying bitcoin.

This thread is probably their source

SEPA was free for me before, now it requires "Bank Wires" which cost £30. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 21:32:14
Like their latest email explains, sell your GBP balance for BTC and buy back again in EUR. That will allow you to use sepa payments.

also, who can be bothered to confirm that address belongs to him.

Yeah, it's why i asked the follow up question.
Regarding the complaints, every company has a lot of complaints, people don't generally post about positive experiences. Just search for coinbase, but they are trustworthy company. I am not endorsing igot, I am just saying that a search on reddit is not always truthy.

Bitpay uses bank accounts, but not for the consumer. There is no fee to the consumer.
It was probably just a chance in exchange rates between viewing the deposit amount, and the amount showing up in your account. But there are no fees. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 11:50:33

Can you give us any hints? Is it going to be something like Coinbase, where i can buy and sell easily? 
Looking forward to LazyPay launching too.

You could buy BTC from  using your Thailand bank account and sell them straight away on  using your Austrailian bank account.
It may not be the most streamlined process, but it should be pretty fast, and a huge amount cheaper.

Coinbase also offer multisig wallets, which are arguably better as they are also insured. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:42:26
I would not use one. I would use a wallet on your desktop that is easily backed up (Electrum for example) and then have watch only addresses in the Blockchain.info app on your phone. 
That or Coinbases multisig wallet, which can still be accessed if they go down.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:57:05


That's the whole point of a free market. I would say it's worth 20% to have it done properly, by someone who is trusted, compared to paying 1% to someone who may just end up stealing it all.

Probably not, but 20% seems reasonable to me.

They store one key, you store the other, and the 3rd is unencrypted with your password on clientside, similar to how most sites do it.

Because you did not even look? It's the first and second result when searching for "utah".

Few quick examples: 
- Putting "Donate BTC to:" in commit messages. 
- Huge commits, very hard to follow
- No coding styles (very inconsistent tabs/spaces etc)
- Commented out code all over the place
- Log files committed
- .ftpquota?
- Use composer!
Head over to  and read. It will help you, and others a lot in the long run.
Also, look into Laravel. It will save you a lot of time for this sort of stuff, and is much cleaner code.
- Html in model?
- You need a model per entity, not one huge model that does everything
- Your branch should just be "master". "exchange" does not make any sense. 
- Tests?

Coinbase multisig vault is pretty easy to setup. You can also access it using their open source tools if you ever need to get they BTC out if their main site is down.

Android, but I mean the web service. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 08:44:21
Terrible way of looking at things. Security through obscurity is not security.
If you look at it like this, surely you would want Bitcoin to be closes source too?
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:32:53
Really cool idea! Keep up the awesome work.
@_date: 2015-02-24 13:31:01


- 1 - Use Multisig Wallet. 
- 2 - Stop spreading FUD

Do you understand multisig?

I am sorry, but that means shit all. Someone who has managed to get to that position in the government, clearly knows their shit. Judging people on their passed jobs is pointless. I am sure he wasn't in the government because he had some personal agenda against the public.

Read the thread title again.

That is kinda the point of this thread.

They didn't. They just have not integrated it into their new system yet. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:02:31


Bitpay are in a totally different market though. They provide a service to merchants only, Coinbase is for consumers mainly. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:25:24
Also, i must admit, it's just lazy integration on the developers part. I use Coinbase on a few of my sites, and the customers don't even know I use it. I could switch to Stripe, Bitpay and they would never know. You do not NEED an account for Coinbase, you just need an account in the way that the developers have integrated it. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 14:26:22


Except that in this instance, they only know 1 out of 3, so they cannot. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:40:09
Looks like it:

Or because I am correct.

Cool story bro

It was a bit harsh, but genuinely, you need to chill out.

Maybe not, but I doubt there is much crossover between Bitcoin users and WordPress.com users right now. Most people here will self host WordPress.org

No idea why i used that word, i just meant the android apis in general. They do a lot for you. I still hate Java though :P
Although your code is definitely much better than most of the java I have seen. At least it's readable and easy to follow.

The beautiful thing about Bitcoin, is that those businesses can exist, and you don't have to use them.
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:33:12
People need to realise that companies like Digital Ocean do not use Stripe's checkout.js. It's not as simple as "enabling" it when you have a custom implementation.
@_date: 2015-02-24 13:35:20
Will you be spending from it, or just checking balance/receiving?
If it's the latter, Blockchain.info app with watch only addresses is good. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:16:48
Depends on the agreements with the investors. I know a lot of companies where the investors have very little say in the running of the business. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:21:13
Not my app, but I do not think so. Its the very first release though, so maybe in the future.

Did you even read the site? They do.

Ahh awful :(
I sell on there quite often, but I just use the sellers that are on the "sell" page, as they normally have high reputation etc. 
Do your deposits not show up on your bank instantly?

Maybe if you are a shit developer. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 19:36:21
You are correct. I only read it when they first announced it, and it looks like Coindesk had to reach out for clarification too. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 14:03:24
Yeah, fuck Coinbase for complying with legal requests
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:51:14
Yeah man, creating ColdFusion was pretty shady of him. 


Some proof would be good. Otherwise, stop spreading FUD
@_date: 2015-02-22 14:27:49
It's an announcement for the public. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:38:36
And guns.
@_date: 2015-03-02 13:56:00


Correct. But it was just an idea, hence the "Just an idea."

Yeah have done. Being able to access Copay from my Mac means that it's better for me atm.

While true, Dark Wallet is still in Alpha. I would not recommend people use it on non testnet.

It seems to be fine in the UK, most small shops charge. Either that, or they just have a minimum spend (or sometime both).
@_date: 2016-07-22 20:37:22
Totally disagree. For every person you see complaining on reddit about Coinbase, there will be thousands that have never had issues. They provide a very valuable service for a lot of people.
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:10:58
Bitpay will more than likely be tracking this all too. It's required by law in a lot of countries.

Do you get to go to secret clubs with Bill Gates?
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:45:37
They have a lot of users, so there are going to be issues here.

Yeah, with a large abstraction layer.

Google: "The vocal minority". People very rarely post on forums etc when things are going well.
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:16:43
Just pointing out that not everyone has issues. Most people who have positive experiences don't post about it on reddit, therefor we get the perception that things are bad.

@_date: 2016-07-22 17:44:27
Given that Coinbase need to integrate with banking partners etc, they don't have as much choice as you think they do. Their entire business is to be an on and off ramp.
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:03:22
How did you lose money on Localbitcoins? :O
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:23:14
There is a difference between supporting coinbase as an on/off ramp, and saying that everyone should store all of their bitcoins in Coinbase's standard wallets. (I like that you are conveniently totally ignoring their Vault wallets)
@_date: 2016-07-23 10:18:01
I currently use Copay, should I switch? Or does it not make much difference?
