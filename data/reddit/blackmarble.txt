Most mobile wallets with generated 12 word seeds do not have a facility for a password in combination.  
I like Trezor for this because you have the option to create multiple HD address collections from a single seed be varying the passphrase (or not using one at all).  This creates plausible deniability as you can have one or more decoy passwords where you store a lesser amount of coin... All of which is recoverable from the same seed.

There are multiple problems with your supposition:
* Visa does not issue credit cards, banks do.  The transactions just use Visa's network.
* bitcoin is a bearer instrument and cannot be used for credit.  People would buy more than they can pay and can only be sues for dollars or euros as they are legal tender.
* The exchange rate flutuates (sometimes dramatically) between the time you buy and the time you pay.
I already have a Visa bitcoin debit card by a company called Shift that allows me to spend bitcoin in my Coinbaae acccount anywhere Visa is accepted.

Yeah, the documentary tells the jist but it's a vast oversimplification.  The fed can create and destroy money and the fed can raise and lower certain interest rates (not retail rates like you or I see at the bank)... these are true, but the part about one being the two activities being tied to the other is wrong.  
Now generally when the fed prints money, retail interest rates **tend** to rise, but interest rates can also rise even if the Fed isn't printing money, because they are driven by markets, not just the Fed.
When someone says "the Fed is lowering interest rates", they don't mean the Fed is printing money, they mean the Fed is actually changing the only interest rate it controls, the discount rate, which doesn't involve printing money at all.

This is wrong.  The cutting of interest rates can act in the same manner as increasinging the money supply, but only to a limited degree.  The flaw in your reasoning is that interest rates can only be lowered so much.  They are near zero now.  On the other hand, the amount of money that can be printed is infinite.... therein the difference lies.

I wouldn't totally agree.  
"Lowering interest rates" is actually just the Fed lowering the "discount rate" (the rate of interest the Fed charges banks who run out of money overnight).  This base rate drives the higher "federal funds rate" (the rate at which banks loan each other on the books of the Fed overnight to cover their reserve ratio).  These rates are a major influencing factor on market driven downstream interest rates. Lowering these rates is not printing money at all.
Now after the Fed lowered the discount rate to zero, they couldn't lower it anymore (we still don't have negative interest rates in the US), so they instead resorted to "quantitative easing" (the act of buying used US Treasury bonds from banks by drawing money from on an account with a no balance).  Quantitative easing is *definitely* "printing money", but it doesn't violate the sanctity of the treasury because the Fed is not buying bonds directly from it.  QE artificially inflates the prices of bonds in the markets.  Since bond prices and yields are inversely correlated, it drives down bond yields in the market having the effect of keeping interest rates low.
What Trump was likely talking about is different.  What the story implies is Trump would be allowing the treasury to print money to directly service the national debt or as a tax rebate directly to US taxpayers.  This involves no bonds or secondary markets and is the quickest path to hyperinflation of a fiat currency.  it's quite possible that if we have another financial crisis on par with 2008, this may end up happening.

For the first part re: **all** funds, I think I need to read Rusty's blog and get up to speed with the latest before I can comment.  For now I'll take your word for it.
I don't know where you started in this thread, but my original contention is that leaving blocks small causes issues with the minimal level of trustlessness for LN.


No.  But bitcoin has never had perpetually full blocks before.  With opt-in RBF and a limited block size, people will keep upping fees jockeying for position in totally full blocks.  This has never even been tested before, so we can't say for sure how the fee market will respond.  My bet is poorly.  


Lets say Bitcoin stays capped at 1MB and adoption increases and fees jump to 5 mBTC, at the same time, we have another bull run that puts us up to $10K per BTC.  That's $50 a tx!  Normally with plenty of room in the blocks, people won't pay that shit.  They will sit around and wait for some greedy miner to snap them up at a lower cost, because there's room in the blocks to.  But that doesn't happen because all the blocks are full because everyone is rich and buying shit.  
The Lightning Network is the solution to clear the backlog, so you open a 50/50 channel which costs you 5 mBTC you buy a bunch of stuff in 24 txs paying a LN fee of .25 mBTC ($2.50, but hey 1/20th the cost of Bitcoin) so 6 mBTC in total.  Then you go to buy a cup of coffee for .5 mBTC and it doesn't go through, then you try to buy something else for 2 mBTC and that doesn't go through.  The operator has already made his nut, and now he's just going to take everything you spend and be non-cooperative, after he sucks 4 mBTC ($40) from you transactions would resume.
But he stole from you so you say FTS and go to rage quit the channel, but you realize that would now cost you 6 mBTC (WTF? it went up?) to do so.  So cut your losses with this channel and you open one with someone else and in two weeks the same god-damned thing happens!  Instead of your channel lasting 3 months, they only lasted 2 weeks.  So there's 6x more transactions than expected, which of course add to the bloat.
Let's contrast this with the same scenario with wide open blocks and no fee market.  Fees stay roughly what they are now until the price spikes, when fees lower to an equilibrium of about what they are now to cover energy costs and profit in a competitive mining market so the fees are now .01 mBTC (10 cents)  which is double because the block reward halved.  You can pay .01 cents a tx, or use the Lightning Network and pay .002 mBTC (1/5th of a bitcoin transaction, much better margin for operator)... no brainer!  You do so (as does everyone else) and at some point in your 3-month channel, you lose .009 mBTC (9 cents) to the same issue.... you don't even notice.

From the Lightning Network [whitepaper](


This was of course written before SegWit so max block weight of 4MB give a practical sustained increase of ~1.6x over pre-Segwit for transactions like LN channel creation, still nowhere near what you'll need for massive adoption.
Schnorr will definitely help, but it only aggregates signatures... you still have to include inputs and outputs for both sides of each channel.  Still, batches can only be made so large unless you rely on a trusted 3rd party to aggregate your tx with others.. even then they are capped by a max tx size (used to be 100k before SegWit, not sure now).  So let's be optimistic and say another 30% decrease in blockspace required.
You're still looking somewhere in the ballpark of 80MB blocks (size, not weight... remember Schorr will undo most of the gains by SegWit because it shrinks the witness).   Anyone who tells you we'll never have to increase blocksize is blowing smoke up your ass.

It is complicated to be sure, but I see your point.  I'll have to do more reading up and come back with questions.  
Still very heavily in the big block camp, but it never hurts to have a thorough understanding of all the issues involved.  I'm honestly very excited about LN tech, but still want to be able to cheaply write to the blockchain.

To a degree, but semantics here are an important distinction.  You are saying one thing is effectively the same as another.  I say it is not.  As an example, you can say that going on vacation is effectively quitting your job because you don't have to show up to work, so same effect right?  But there are other affects you are not considering.
It is impossible to create hyperinflation through interest rate cuts alone, therefore it is not the same as printing money.

 &gt;What's "doesn't go through" entail? In the case that the HTLC doesn't fully propagate due to an unresponsive peer, the commitment transaction still has an ample fee attached to it, and you'll be able to claim all funds after the "pay-to-self" CSV timeout.
You are speaking in terms of a single point to point channel, which has extremely limited utility as it is not very often you pay the same party a great number of times over the lifespan of a channel.  I am speaking about a scenario where Alice wants to pay Carol for a cup of coffee and Bob operates a LN hub with channels to both Alice and Carol (as would be the most common use case).  
Bob has a lot of bitcoin, but still can't afford a symmetric channel for everyone connected to the hub.  
Carol is a merchant and will generally only ever really be receiving funds from Bob for sales through his hub.  So her channel is heavily asymmetrically weighted on Bob's side, and Bob collects LN fees from Carol by withholding a portion of each transaction that goes through his hub.  
Alice is a consumer with unrelated income and only really ever pays Bob when she wants something from one of the merchants connected to his hub.  Her channel with Bob is asymmetrical as well, only weighted towards her.
When I say "doesn't go through", I mean that Alice pays Bob, but Bob does not pay Carol.  What is Alice's recourse in this scenario?  What mechanism is in place to ensure Alice's payment to Bob is forwarded to Carol.

The difference is the dollar is debt based, an IOU for a dollar is a dollar.  Bitcoin on the other hand is asset based, an IOU for a bitcoin is not a bitcoin.

Is this Rusty?


To be clear, you mean all **remaining** funds, not everything commited to the channel regardless of what was transacted in the channel, correct?  If someone could back out completely before the channel closes,  it would be much worse than a chargeback.


Relayed is not confirmed.  In a small block / fee market scenario there would be many transactions above the 'dust' relay limit that never make it into a block before the channel timeout.  This of course can be solved by opt-in RBF, but only by increasing the fee which per my original assertion is irrational because it costs more that the amount in dispute.

As far as i have ever heard, it doesn't.  The Lightning Network is a payment channel system that settles with only an opening and closing transaction actually posted to the blockchain.  It's use cases have never been intended for Bitcoin as an asset registry or colored coins. This is one of the reasons many think that LN is not a substitute for blocksize increase.

I find it's only after a few back and forths with someone on the other side of the debate do we begin to believe the other is actually a reasonable person.
Not an unreasonable argument, but i counter with Metcalfe's law.  As more places accept bitcoin as a form or payment, more users will make transactions.  This occurs as a square of the participants of a network... you are assuming linear growth in transaction  count and i just don't think that's realistic.  I spend bitcoins maybe 10 times a year, but if everyone accepted it, 20-50 times a week easy... if the fee stays the same.
If you take this into accout transaction counts skyrocket exponentially as adoption continues.

They aren't attached they are designated.  You don't have to buy them with bitcoin you can buy them with fiat.  A single bitcoin can represent 100 million shares, each a satoshi, but only portions of that specific bitcoin. 
Once a coin is colored it is still a bitcoon but also represents this other asset.  If somebody gathers over 50% of this bitcoin, that person has control of the company.  This is just like traditional stocks only much easier to trade and keep track of.

Even the current fee of pennies (for a $1 transaction) is currently nearly as expensive as a [contactless small value immediate debit visa transfer fee in Europe](   If the fee goes up this limits even non-microtransactional uses of Bitcoin proper.
As for microtransactions the proposed scaling mechanism of the Lightning Network [is not trustless for transaction amounts lower than the fee](  If the Bitcoin fee goes up to $5 LN becomes about as trustless as the banking system.
Now i have to read up on segregated witness and try to figure out if it's feasible or just another pipe dream like I believe small block LN to be.  This shit moves so fast.
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:33:30
This is wrong.
Although there may be a hard cap on the total number of bitcoins, there is no limit to the amount of value they can be used to represent.  Currently each bitcoin is divisible to 100 Million units, making the total divisible bitcoin 2.1 Quadrillion satoshis.  The protocol can always be allowed to fork and increase divisibility if consensus is reached that  it is warranted, meaning the total number of smallest divisible units is unlimited.
The amount of bitcoin used on any 'Project' is arbitrary and completely dependent on the value of that bitcoin at the time.  
Simply put: If the value of a bitcoin doubles, the same amount of bitcoin can be used to fund both project 1 and project 2 without any additional bitcoin being created.

Bitcoin is not fungible, i.e. any one unit of bitcoin is not necessarily the same as any other unit because you can see the entire transaction history of each unit (albeit fuzzily through taint).  [Colored coins]( take advantage of this property to assign the value of a non-bitcoin asset, like shares in a company's stock or a land title, to a specific  unit of bitcoin thus "coloring" it.  These colored coins exist only on the bitcoin blockchain, and are typically highly divisible.
2-way pegged [Sidechains]( are a different matter entirely.  The create a binding mechanism between two blockchains and allow you to "lock" bitcoin in it's chain as the only way to "release" coin in an alternate chain.  This has been possible before via Proof of Burn, but the innovation of 2-way Sidechains is that you can actually do the reverse and lock the alternate coin and release your Bitcoin.  There can be a multitude of sidechains and each can have a large number of variations from the Bitcoin protocol, allowing experimentation without risk to the Bitcoin blockchain and all sorts of other neat things.

The halving is over a year and a half away.  Given that the half-life of productivity of ASIC mining equipment is measured in days, there is no way it could possibly be priced in at this point.  
To remain in the mining game until the halving you'll have to purchase (or more likely design &amp; manufacture) several generations of ASICs with exponential performance increases at each generation.

You have gone out of your way to provide a common, yet very specific scenario where bitcoin provides little direct benefit as a single purchase.  That does not mean that it does not have benefits to others outside of your narrow set of conditions.  If you do the same thing in US, fees are higher.  If you are in Africa you likely don't have a bank, but do have a cell phone.  If you're buying something that's £5 instead of £100 the 40p charge is significant.  You can't take a very specific example of a scenario where something only works marginally better than something else, then apply that as a truism in all cases.

Massive disruption and upheaval of existing financial markets.  Some people will get rich, others will get poor.  As people move away from fiat, demand will drop and supply will increase causing hyper-inflation.  Things will get really ugly as fiat dies and tries to take society with it, but society will survive.  The lumbering dinosaur banks will cease to exist as they are today, but will morph into leaner financial service service businesses.
There will be further evolution and innovation, probably new currencies or sidechains, to account for problems most people don't think about like mortgage problem (Q: How does one take out a massive 30 year loan in  a deflationary currency? A: You don't.)

Keypairs have two parts, an address and a private key.  The address can always be created if you have the private key but never the reverse.  Bitcoins themselves are just entries on a distributed shared ledger that tells everyone how much bitcoin is in each address.  The private key allows you create a send transaction from its address to any other.  
You should never take over an address from anyone because they still have a copy of the private key and can spend from it.  Instead, have them send it to a new address you create in your wallet.  Address reuse should be avoided as well.  Newer features like HD wallets make this easy.

Lender beware:
You can't reliably collect interest in a deflationary medium like bitcoin.  Especially when it's still hyper-deflationary as it has been so far.  If you loan somebody with a perfect rating 10 bitcoin at $100, and the price jumps to $1,000, then you will never see your bitcoin again.  BTCJam is full of such stories.
Even without hyper-deflation, there is still the mortgage problem.  With a fractional reserve inflationary system, you can get a 30 year fixed interest rate loan and be pretty confident your payment will become less burdensome over time due to inflation (or refinance for lower interest rates).  In a deflationary currency, every year you will be paying more value, even if no interest is charged.  Eventually,  when you are not able to pay and default, the collateral isn't worth the bitcoin that is still owed on it because the bitcoin is worth more than when it was loaned.  So both the borrower and the lender lose on the deal.
Also add to that the fact that most people take out loans in bitcoin to fund misguided mining operations that end up going belly up because they don't account for the exponential difficulty raise.
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:47:35

You are making a fundamental mistake.  You are confusing price inflation with currency supply inflation.  Although bitcoin's price will inflate, there will never be any additional currency added beyond 21 million BTC.  The miner's have an incentive never to create new bitcoins because doing so would only make the ones they earn less valuable.  The federal reserve by contrast is creating a new $75 billion every month at present, increasing the total money supply of USD and making each dollar worth slightly less.  Divisibility does not cause currency inflation because one bitcoin is still the same amount relative to the total amount of bitcoin (once all 21 Million have been created).  Dollar-Satoshi parity, the point at which you predict a collapse, pegs a single bitcoin at $100 Million dollars.  If this were to happen the dollar would already be utterly worthless and bitcoin would be the currency of the world.  A ninth decimal is not currently in existence for the same reason a hundredth decimal isn't, it's simply not necessary for in the immediate future.  
To put it one final way, any increase in divisibility is equivalent to a stock split, as opposed to issuing new stock, or dilution.  See the difference?

The correlation is not with good news but rather with hype.  Many of us refer to this as the hype cycle.  We are at the low point in the hype cycle right now, where both good and bad news have little effect on the price, so it is relatively stable.  Soon we will enter a positive feedback loop of hype seemingly driven by the mainstream media, but actually driven by new adoption (speculative mania) and amplified by the media.  At this point all bad news will be ignored and all good news will cause further price increases.  This will peak and be followed by a crash, during which good and bad news will oscillate the price until it finds a new equilibrium, which is where we are today.

The fact that the price is fairly stable right now means the market is demanding coins at the same rate as they are being supplied.  The halving will also drive the whole digital scarcity concept home for all of these new users.  It's a pretty big fucking deal.

Those charges are reflected in the 2-3% percent the debit card network charges the merchant.  Retailers typically only make 4-5% on big ticket items like printers, so if you paid in bitcoin it would nearly double the merchants profits.  Competition would then force margins lower and the savings would be passed on to you... The consumer.
Edit:  i've worked corporate retail in the states, it's a flat fee plus percentage here, and it's very expensive.  Can't vouch for Britain, but suspect you may be mistaken.

You talk about trust like it's a black or white, all or nothing thing.  The fact is that it's not.  You may trust your wife to take the kids to school, but not to perform open-heart surgery on you.
Before bitcoin, you had to trust somebody to denominate currency.  We had a gold reserve system, but that inevitably failed because you can't really trust anyone to that... if you own the press. it is irrational not to print more money than you have reserves for.  Eventually through a process explained far better than I ever could [here]( we ended up with the current fiat system.  It's flawed and doomed to failure, but until the advent of bitcoin we literally had no other choice.  Any private institution issuing currency would pose significant counter-party risk due to the aforementioned irrationality.  The best case scenario would be hyperinflation, followed by a return to full reserve, then the cycle would repeat.
I trust in government because I am a collectivist.  I think it is an excellent thing that we have compulsory, publicly funded education, among other things, because it makes us a better society.  As bloated and inefficient as our military is, I trust it far more than I would any private institution to provide defense from foreign invaders. I trust the rule of law and while imperfect and often unfair, it's far preferable to anarchy.
I don't trust governments to print money simply because nobody can be trusted not to abuse that power.  In the past it was necessary to trust somebody, but now it is not, so why would I?
@_date: 2014-02-05 11:03:37
There's no need to guarantee bitcoin against counterparty risk like a bank run... It's 100% reserve.  Private escrow and insurance can take care of the rest.  Disputes can be settled by arbitration or courts as they are now.  Fraud should be prosecuted.  That's it.

No.  The bubbles only occur during the exponential growth phase of the s-curve of technological adoption.  They occur when growth of the price exceeds even the exponential pace.  Once Bitcoin reaches its asymptote (mass adoption or maturity of the technology) the curve will stabilize and you will see volatility as small as we see in most currencies / indices.  
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:13:12
A couple of reasons.  You are still in a fiat mindset.  If everything goes right, you'll make 10%, but the profit is in fiat, not bitcoin. I know you think can instantly buy bitcoin and that will result in in you never missing a market move, but you are wrong.  When everybody buys in, coins become scarce.  Coinbase put a 3 day delay on 'instant' purchases during the last spike.  If you happen to have sold off your coin recently (for cash which you then have to physically deposit in a bank) then you will be locked out of the buy.
And that's if you aren't mugged for your coin or given counterfeit cash.  If the IRS finds out you are not paying taxes on these trades, there will be no lube.
Since you are making your gains in fiat, even worse cash, you are far more likely to spend them for your day to day expenses.  When you buy and hold you treat the purchase as a total loss.
You may not realize it but in effect, you will be day trading, just on a shitty exchange with almost no liquidity.  You may make some money, but nowhere near as much as by buying incrementally and holding.

This is done by nearly every merchant signed up by coinbase or bitpay.  The probable exception is Overstock. But even they probably keep a minority percentage in bitcoin.  Businesses cannot tolerate volatility. They instantly liquidate which creates sell pressure.  Doesn't matter if its on exchange or not, aggregate supply and demand determines price in the market.
Bottom line, stores want people to spend bitcoin so they can make more fiat.  Likely demand will increase due to scarcity and utility, when it does the price will rise and businesses will start asking themselves, "how much could we have made if we actually kept the bitcoin?". They will start to hold and hedge which will have a compounding effect on the price increase... Then, moon.

I disagree.  I believe two-way pegged sidechains will be the biggest thechnological acheivement since bitcoin itself.  They will add near infinite flexibility to the secure, but very rigid bitcoin network.  It will make bitcoin into a much more viable and robust smart currency, enabling applications we can't even dream of yet.
The challenge, as mentioned in the whitepaper, is to cryptographically prove the coins are locked without having to contunually track a foreign blockchain.  It is not a simple problem.
If bitcoin is to dominate world currency, it will be possible because of sidechains.

You've made money and now have to pay taxes on the long term capital gains, at rates that are likely waaay less than your income tax.
If you accept that as fact, then the only problem is keeping track of the gains/losses and selling an appropriate amount to cover the taxes on whatever you spend.  Somebody needs to bake this functionality into a wallet to make it straightforward and easy.  If you can enter a cost basis and tell the wallet if a transaction is a move, spend or gift then it's easy to calculate the gains &amp; taxes and adjust the "price" accordingly.  With that information in hand, you can decide if you really want to spend.  Or better yet, save.

Bitcoin is not very useful as a as a means of value transfer at this point.  The reason is because there is only a total of ~$7 Billion of it.  If Facebook wanted to buy Whatsapp with Bitcoin, it couldn't.  So either Bitcoin will grow to a level where it will be useful in this manner, making it much more useful in general or it won't.  The supposition of the 'many times its current value or close to nothing' is because most of its current value comes from speculation.  Either the speculative value will be replaced by real utility as a means of transfer as described above or it won't.  If it never does, the current speculatory value will wane and it will drop to the close to nothing level.

Kind of.  You can see all balances of every address, but the blockchain (ledger) basically only stores from address, to address, sending IP address and amount.  So if a person is careful and always uses new addresses, it is difficult to follow.  This is known as a pseudononyous system.  Everyone can see what has happened, but not necessarily by whom.

Yes, bitcoin's price is a fractal.  Increasing by roughly 1 order of magnitude with each spike followed by a steep selloff then stabilization at "The new normal".  I count at least 4 such spikes so far and expect 2 more before bitcoin is large enough to be useful as a currency.  When the next spike hits, you won't even be able to see the first one you pointed out without a log graph, it will be too small.

Well for that line of reasoning your vision is actually probably a bit short-sighted.  Most likely by the time we hit that stuff, advances in AI and nanotechnology will allow us to have virtual presence simulated in our spinal cords.  Read "The Singularity is Near", it actually dovetails quite well with bitcoin as it explains how the exponential S curve of technological adoption that bitcoin is currently experiencing unfolds.
My biggest problem with your vision was that it seemed to create a reality where technology isolated people from one another, where the opposite is always the case.

Not that much.  A proper mining ROI (return on investment) calculation should always be done in bitcoin not $'s.  Since they could have bought bitcoin directly instead of equipment to mine bitcoin.  Since the price has gone down, buying bitcoin at the time instead of mining equipment would have been an equally 'bad' (short term) decision.

Each major bubble (the ones clearly visible on the 1 year graph) thus far has represented a 10x increase in price.  If just three more bubbles were to occur, bitcoin would be over a million dollars apiece, or at bit-dollar parity.  This is unlikely without massive fiat hyperinflation because the market cap of bitcoin would be $21 trillion, or more liquidity than currently exists in the world including derivatives markets.
I'd say one more bubble is definite, maybe two and in a much shorter time frame than you state.

Upvote for the points of differentiation from gold, but what Bitcoin and gold have in common is they are both "hard currency".  They are traded for the price they are given based on their own merit as a thing (abstract as a bitcoin is) in a free market.  
Fiat's value is partially defined and determined by the governement: where they say this piece of paper is worth 5 and this one is worth 10, when in actuality they have the same value.  Fiat is soft currency because it represents value of money, bitcoin and gold are hard currency because they ARE the value of money.

A slow and steady climb is unrealistic.  Bitcoin will continue in bursts of mania induced panic buying followed by massive drops, decreasing occilation to a new stable value (you are here), which will slowly, steadily rise to the old peak upon which the cycle will repeat.  Plotting each of the peaks or stabilized points will reveal the exponential curve it's actually following and will continue to follow until it either reaches the asymptote of mass adoption or collapses to a near zero value due to failure.

Security fail.  If your paper wallet had BIP0038 encryption and you had multiple redundant copies, no problem.  Give it away freely, go home and move the coin to a new wallet before the mugger does enough research to know he's just got a worthless piece of paper.
Better yet, NEVER carry a paper wallet in the first place.  They are cold storage and should be secured as such.  Your multiple redundant copies should be secured in separate locations.  
Bitcoin is property, but the cops don't give a shit if somebody mugs you for your $10k watch either.  With bitcoin, the only one responsible for security is you.  Not to say what happened was right or you deserved it, but honestly man, it could have been avoided.
Edit: He might have tried to get your password for the encryption, but the decryption process on the phone takes a few minutes, so he would only make a few failed attempts.  Also, a multi-sig wallet would eliminate the ability to be stolen at gunpoint, but the best solution is really just to make sure your shit is locked up tight.

Oh no, not at all!  It has a tremendous impact on price.  The impact doesn't occur at the time of the halving, but as a distribution smear ahead of it.  This is because the halving occurs at a mathematically predictable point in time and thus gets "priced in" to the market well in advance.

This is true.  But if you've been holding bitcoin for a few years as an asset, it's already vastly exceeded any financial world rate of return like Bernie Madoff's 15%.  Bitcoin itself looks like a ponzi or pyramid at first glance.  By your criteria, nobody should have bought in all of 2013, because the returns were too high.  I think because of the very nature of Bitcoin itself, it draws risk takers which in general are more susceptible to such scams.

They've already clearly demonstrated they they have no problem with being over 51% of the hashing power.  Whether they do anything nefarious with it or not, it's terrible for bitcoin.  Honestly, mining centralization if one of the few ways bitcoin can fail.  If it does, there will be plenty of mining pool resistant altcoins that spring up to fill the vaccum.
If I had monopoly hashing, I'd design my own pool resistant coin on a new algo and create ASICs for it before anyone else then crash bitcoin and become the savior of crypto by selling the new equipment for the new pool-less coin, which of course I now have a secret monopoly on.

-Does he understand that there are legitimate, law abiding reasons for tumblers/obfuscation on a public ledger?
-What does he think about the frozen funds at Mt Gox, how would regulation benefit consumers in that instance?
-Is he aware that bitcoin is full reserve only and any institution claiming to have funds can easily prove (or be compelled to prove) control of said funds with signatures?
-Will there be any kind of arbitration or remediation for customer disputes with exchanges?
-Aside from exchanges following established AML/KYC guidelines, what further regulatory burden does he think will be necessary to allow bitcoin to innovate while controlling money laundering?
-Has he been in contact with FinCen?  They seem to believe that no further regulations are required beyond what is already in the books.

Because it will always be worth more to save it than to lend it over such a long period, so nobody will.  A static inflationary currency does little to help because it's too easy to do the math on the inflation.  An inflationary currency with a target inflation rate adjusted as an inverse of transaction volume over the total volume may work, but it would have to be tied to the deflationary bitcoin by proof of burn.  I call the concept Sistercoin.

I live in the USA.  I pay my taxes.  In the USA, you have to pay Capital Gains Taxes on spent bitcoin if it has increased in value.  I would like a client-side Bitcoin wallet that lets me mark a transaction as a "spend" as opposed to "move" and record the price at the time of spend so I can easily calculate my capital gain/loss at the end of the year.  If I had such a feature in my wallet, I would spend more.

Ignore my last comment, it was stupid.  There are only two factors in price, ever.  Supply and demand.  You are speaking to the demand side of the equation. It's not greater than or less than the supply side of the equation... it is exactly half of the equation.  There is only one thing that changes in the supply side of bitcoin (other than the slight accelleration due tot he exponential hashing increases) and that is the halving.  
There are many, many factors that affect the Demand side of the equation, but none of them are as dominant as the halving is to the supply side.

1) Mt. Gox was a Bitcoin exchange.  They matched buy and sell orders to facilitate trade and..
2) took a small relatively amount from each party. This works the same as an any other simple exchange (more complex exchanges trade on derivatives).
3) They lost the majority of the bitcoins they were holding on customer's behalves.  This was either to to outside theft, insider fraud, or incompetence.  If the coins were not stolen by Karpeles or someone else, it is possible that he secured them so well as to prevent even himself from ever retrieving them.  Thus they would be effectively destroyed.  Nobody has provided conclusive proof either way.
4) This is a subjective bullshit question I won't waste time on.
5) There are already a multitude of exchanges that perfom the same function as Mt. Gox.  Bitstamp, BTC-E, Kraken, Bitfinex are all direct exchanges and localbitcoins allows for meatspace trades.  What's more now there are now abstracted, user-friendly services to buy and sell bitcoin such as Coinbase and Circle.

Hey man, don't lump yourself in with us!
Seriously though, I don't think fractional reserve will work for bitcoin because it didn't work for gold.  Sooner or later you get a run on the banks for the underlying asset and you have to decouple, which ends in fiat, which hyperinflates to extinction.  Wash, rinse, repeat.
The mortgage problem you mention is legitimate, but I think a full reserve, algorithmically velocity-based inflationary (less velocity --&gt; more inflation) 2-way pegged side-chain is the answer.  It will enable loans to be made with the interest rate floating against an inflation rate that is stable, but not totally predictable.

Messages signed by the private key can be cryptographically verified by anyone who receives them using he bitcoin protocol.  This is what proves you have control over the funds and is a vital feature that makes bitcoin a true "triple entry" accounting system.  
It is easy to audit.  In the case of multisig, both parties can just sign a message (have not tried this myself yet).  In the case of split key, the key must be recombined to sign the message just as if you were dispersing funds.

Just in case you are not full of shit... Contact [Second Market]( and establish an account on their trading desk.  There is no way to cash out that kind of volume without tanking the market and making them worthless.  If you can prove ownership of the amount of bitcoin (via message signed with the private key) you are claiming you will likely deal directly with the CEO, Barry Silbert.  He will get you in touch with large scale institutional buyers.  It will take time to liquidate such a large amount, but once you sell a few million dollars worth, you may want to wait to part with the rest.

To an extent I agree, but there's one thing you have to remember:  we are early adopters, still even now.  We are in the wild west of Bitcoin.  By the time it reaches the mass adoption level, it won't even be recognizable as Bitcoin due to the layers of abstraction built on top.  
Of course you and I will continue to use Bitcoin directly, but Grandma won't.  She won't know what a private key is or the hashrate, just like today she uses the internet without knowing what an IP address, DNS, or even a firewall is.  Sure, she is exposed to greater risk, but it will be managed risk.  Companies like Circle and Blockchain.io are starting this now.  (Circle exemplifying the 3rd party risk you worry about, but will probably be more secure than most exchanges).
To say things like in your rant scares people away from Bitcoin unnecessarily.  I would say instead that if you aren't willing to put in the effort to learn how to properly manage your bitcoin, then you should wait until it's ready for casual users; but don't expect the price to keep rising then like it does now.

Mining is designed to be barely profitable at equilibrium and pretty much has been since shortly after the introduction of ASICs.  
You are succumbing to the Miner's Fallacy, wherein you think profitability of mining has anything to do with the price of bitcoin.  It does not.  Any proper mining ROI should be calculated by the number of bitcoins it would cost you to purchase and operate the mining equipment for its lifespan at current price vs the number of bitcoin you get back over the equipment's life.  If the expected return is lower than the output both in BTC, then it's unprofitable and you should just buy bitcoin.
Since mining profits are so slim anyway and reinvestment is constant, you have to assume the majority of bitcoin mined (at least these days) is sold.  Anything they are not selling they are subsidizing with outside funds, which is basically buying whether or not they are mining.
tl;dr Mining is barely profitable at any price.  If you need he price to be higher to make a profit, your doing it wrong and are better off buying.

Pretty much!  Thanks for actually reading and thinking about what i wrote.  The only thing I would add is that the original 8 decimal places in bitcoin are arbitrary.  For all practical purposes bitcoin (and crypto currrncy in general) is infinitely divisible, but it's not presently worth enough to worry about tracking such small amounts and it would add bloat to the block chain.  Bitcoin is actually deflationary (supply) because everyday some is lost forever by mismanagement of keys.  Because of infinite divisibility, this is no problem as the whole of bitcoin could operate on a single Satoshi if that was all that was left.

Since 2008, quantitative easing has quadrupled the money supply of USD.  Inflation will catch up, so will interest rates.  If you keep a fixed rate mortgage with today's rates and manage to keep a moderate income on par with inflation, it will actually be MUCH cheaper to continue to pay off your existing loan.

This email is about "PIN &amp; chip" technology in credit cards.  It's more secure than traditional credit cards because each transaction is encrypted when you swipe so the merchant can't record the information on your credit card info to make fraudulent transactions.  
It's a definite improvement in CC technology and has been in Europe for years.  The new credit card readers required to utilize it aren't popular in the US yet.  As far as bitcoin goes, this tech makes credit cards slightly less horrible in comparison.

If it is centralized it CAN'T have a fixed number of units because the central authority could arbitrarily increase it at any time.  In theory, there could be a fixed number of USD, but there will never be because it is advantageous for the central authority to create more (inflate away debt).  
A central authority  in charge of a cryptocurrency could also arbitrarily decide to invalidate your Govcoin or give it to someone else.  Do the words "Are you or have you ever been a member of the communist party?" ring any bells?   Overreach can happen, even in America.

This.  I don't know how so many people get this wrong.  Unlike practically anything else, with bitcoin increased demand does not lead to increased supply.  This is because however many people enter the market they cannot create additional supply.  (I know this is not technically accurate because we are ahead of schedule due to exponential difficulty increases, but not by much.)
The result is everybody competing over smaller slices of the pie and increased selling pressure from miners to cover the cost.  When a price rise comes, it will be due to increased demand.

You are correct.  China has been keeping the Yuan artificially low against the dollar for the last few decades to sell their exports and grow their economy.  They have recently changed policy on this and have even stopped buying reserves of USD.  Next they will stop buying US treasuries (our debt).  As the Yuan naturally appreciates against the dollar, the era of cheap Chinese goods will come to an end over in the next few years.

The new money is going to banks who are just sitting on it as reserves.  Ironically, this is because interest rates are so low that they have no incentive to lend it out.  Paradoxically, when inflation starts, the FED will try to curb it by raising rates which in turn will open the floodgates on all the newly printed money.  The FED will have no options but another round of quantitative easing, the hyperinflation death spiral of fiat.

In it's current form, bitcoin is not useful for credit.  This is because bitcoin is two things: sound money and ultimately deflationary.
Bitcoin is sound money because it is not token redeemable for an asset, it is the asset itself; much the same as gold.  If you hold the private key, you own the bitcoin, simple as that.  This doesn't stop one form making loans with it in and of itself, however...
Bitcoin is ultimately deflationary, meaning that in the future, there will be less of a supply of bitcoin than in the present, even though bitcoin is inflationary at the present time.  This being the case, if you loan to somebody in bitcoin over a long period of time, you run a much higher risk of not only not making a profit, but never getting your principle back.  I call this the Mortgage problem.  Why would you loan somebody a bitcoin for 30 years to buy a house when in 30 years that house will almost certainly be worth less than a bitcoin?  You wouldn't.
The risks of lending in bitcoin outweight the benefits in the long run.
So what is the solution?  A 2-way pegged side-chain with market determined inflation within set parameters.  This will allow for an inflationary currency to be 100% backed by bitcoin.  In this currency, the market will have an acceptable  level of risk because the collateral will always appreciate in the currency that the loan was made.  I dunno, call it loancoin.  This was not possible before crypto, because if a currency was backed by a reserve (such as gold) there was no way to ensure the reserve was 100% because people (banks) cheat. Now we can.

That depends.  
"Credit" isn't actually money, it's a promissory note for money.  When you use a credit card, the merchant doesn't get the money when the transaction goes through, it gets a promise from the credit card company that it will receive the money in 30 days (and the money can be taken back by the credit card company for another 60 days after that).
Given this as the context for credit, merchants would have to trust a credit company (by then we won't be using cards) to pay them bitcoin at some point in the future for credit extended to them now.  The credit company would then extend the same to you for a profit in interest.  Due to the deflationary nature of bitcoin, this will most like be unfeasible, because you might never be able to pay back the amount you borrowed, let alone interest and bitcoins are much harder to "collect" than fiat.  Also, since current regulations (i.e. BitLicense) require a 100% reserve, the credit company would have to have as many bitcoins in possession as they are extending credit for, eliminating partial reserve profits like they make in fiat.

You can't choose who mines the block your transaction is included in.  Even the miners have limited discretion over the transactions they can include.  Their ability to choose is limited by the protocol, and mainly relates to who paid fees above a threshold and what order they came in.

Fair Use: As long as you are actually referring to the trademarked good or service, you have the right to use their trademark to do so.
Parody: its okay to make fun of a company by altering their trademark to make as long as reasonable people do not confuse your parody with a good or service offered by the company.

@_date: 2014-01-04 21:38:23
You've hit on a very interesting point or two.  When people say bitcoin will replace banks, they are usually referring to the fact that with bitcoin, you no longer need a checking nor savings account, and will no longer have to pay the associated fees in order to have access to a modern payment system.  In order to securely store and send your money to anyone anywhere, no bank will be required.
The money lending aspect of banks is different.  While bitcoin is still in the exponential growth phase, it would be insane to borrow it at interest, as the growth of value may outstrip your ability to pay back even a small amount of interest.  Longer term it will stabilize, but will still be deflationary (increasing in price over time).  
Loans in a deflationary currency are problematic.  Imagine trying to get a 30 year mortgage loan in bitcoin, which once stable might only grow in value as the population does.  Over time you earn less bitcoin, but retain the same purchasing power because of deflation.  However, you no longer make enough to pay back your mortgage.  The lender can't give you a negative interest rate because they would be financially better off not lending at all.
The only way out of this problem that I see is a Bretton Woods style "Gold Standard" backed by bitcoin.  An inflationary currency issued by a central bank redeemable for bitcoin.  Of course the currency will have to inflate at a roughly set schedule, and the issuing body would need reserves of bitcoin.  With such a tool, banks could loan bitcoin notes at interest and make a profit.

Your Second comment only applies with LIFO cost basis... In which case you will owe income tax on any gain, which can be very high depending on your bracket.
While the IRS may not know you have any, if they ever find out they will accuse you of tax fraud.  You didn't mention you should only do this with coins not linked to you in your original comment.  Most people buy and re-up through coinbase, who will happily open up their books if the IRS asks.
Don't spend info that will get people in trouble down the line.

I am not a lawyer.  I'm not 100% sure, but I think there is a set $ threshold you can sell as an individual without registering as a money transmitter.  I believe it's on the order of $10k a month.  Bear in mind, that figure is total sales, not profit.  And you still have to report profit as income to the IRS, legally speaking.

Never invest more than you are willing to lose outright.  Ask yourself, "If I were to lose this money entirely, would it affect my standard of living?". Unless the answer is an confident "No", don't do it.
The main reason is obvious, so you don't end up poor in the event Bitcoin dies.  But there is a second equally important reason: if you don't mind losing it all, you'll never be tempted to sell at a loss.  If you invest, you have to consider the money gone and write it off entirely.  If you truly believe in it then don't sell, ever.  Because one day you'll be able to spend it on whatever you want.

In that case, it is arguably not really an exchange.  A true exchange has a market depth of all available sellers at any given time so when you go to buy you always get the optimal price for however many coins you are buying, regardless of the number of sellers you are buying from.  What your talking about is like localbitcoins, which I would describe as more of a matchmaking service than an exchange.

@_date: 2014-09-06 22:33:10
You can't do that.  It would create a cycle of more miners entering because it's profitable and fees increasing because because of more miners which create more fees which create more miners... Etc.
That sounds like an excellent way to kill bitcoin.  If the miners are not making a profit, they will drop out eventually lowering the difficulty and making it profitable for the ones who stay... It's called market equilibrium.
@_date: 2014-02-22 14:31:16
Don't daytrade.  Don't try to arbitrage.  Buy and hold.  Besides, the spread on localbitcoins vs a regular exchange is much greater than 5% either direction.  Just bargain hunt.  You might even get lucky and find some poor SOB still using the Gox price.

Don't mine.  Buy and hold.  If you ever calculate an ROI on mining you must do the ROI in bitcoin purchased at current market value.  Without exception (unless you are an ASIC designer with your own fab plant) it is always more profitable to buy than to mine.

Over the next 5-10 years bitcoin will drink gold's milkshake as a store of value because of it's superior properties as a money: 
-Can transact online 
-Better divisibility
-More portable
-Easier to verify
-More finitely limited supply (cannot astroid mine bitcoin)
Without its value as a money, gold's price will drop to its 'intrinsic' value; that of a fairly rare, soft, shiny rock with high conductivity and a low melting point.  Neodymium is way more useful.

It has been very boring until recently.  Now, the COIN ETF decision absolutely will be made one way or the other early next month.  Also, SegWit and BU are effectively tied for hashrate.

@_date: 2014-02-18 15:38:53
This is called arbitrage, and cannot be done with Gox under the current circumstances.  If it could the price would level out with the other exchanges.
@_date: 2015-05-08 01:51:47
I see a flaw in the argument.  If one is trading in and out of fiat at each end of the transaction, the velocity is MUCH slower than the 10 mins in the formula.  If not, then one has to hold bitcoin to take advantage of the speed, which creates demand above what is predicted.
@_date: 2017-02-08 05:32:17
Personally, I'm less interested in the near term price, and more in the long term direction of bitcoin.  It will never be easier to make changes to the protocol than it is right now. These issues should have been dealt with when they were raised by Gavin two years ago, but we as a community have failed to deal with them.
I'm still for a dynamic blocksize increase that will allow on-chain transactions to scale.  If lightning as cheap and effective and decentralized as promised it will easily win in the marketplace, but it want to be able to make afford too make a Bitcoin transaction as Satoshi described it if I so choose.  This will not be possible in a world of only SegWit lightning transactions.
I urge compromise, not ultimatums. 
Edit: for clarity I am for SegWit implemented as a clean hard fork coupled with a dynamic or moderate (50% per year increase) block size cap in the same release.

If you've made any gains on your bitcoin that will cause an issue with taxes.  In the US even if you've been hodling for a year, you're still taxed at 15% whenever you spend.

Merriam Webster has two definitions for the adjective "virtual":

Being in Britain, more than likely you have a pin &amp; chip debit card.  In America we do not, which means in order to purchase that printer, we expose ourselves to identity theft by giving all information necessary to access our bank account to the merchant and trust them not to use it for anything else.  Bitcoin is much cheaper and easier to implement than pin &amp; chip.

This is exactly wrong.  A new block isn't even immutable.  It doesn't reliably become so until 5 additional are mined on top of it.  Once it is immutable, it will remain so as long as there is sufficient PoW being added on top of it, this is true regardless of changes in the protocol.
PoW means that you don't even have to trust the software running... with just a blockchain explorer you can prove its mathematically impossible to alter with less than an unavailable amount of hashpower.

@_date: 2015-01-10 22:12:02
Honestly the whole premise of this is wrong.  Wanting the price of bitcoin to stabilize is like wanting the sun to revolve around the earth, or wanting time to flow backward.  These are natural forces at work and they are going to do what they are going to do regardless of what anyone "wants".
If you want to help the price stabilize... you can buy high and sell low.  Let me know how that works out for you.
Edit: Actually to help stabilize the price you would buy low and sell high... rational speculative behavior.

This is getting fixed very soon when version .10 comes out of Bitcoin Core.  It reindexes "headers first" meaning the whole blockchain will re-index in a few hours on nearly any machine.

I disagree.  Services like Bitpay remove the risk and encourage adoption, but put downward pressure on price because most companies instantly sell all bitcoin for fiat upon reciept.  The upswings of price caused by volatility will make at least some of them rethink that decision.  When merchants start holding bitcoin, then will be headed toward true stability.

Look at it this way.  If bitcoin takes off and becomes everything that people believe it will be, then a relatively small amount at today's prices will be enough to make you wealthy.  If, however, a fatal flaw is discovered and the price drops to near zero then you are only out what you buy in with.
Only buy with an amount of fiat you are willing to lose completely.  As soon as you buy, write off the entire purchase.  Pretend the money is gone, because in fact it is; either until you sell or spend it.  Cold storage is your friend.

That was kinda the point of the expression.  I don't even care enough to bother figuring out how much I care.
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:49:56
A couple of reasons.  
It's cool.  If you haven't tried it yet, you should just because it's fun and it **feels** like the future.  It's fun to throw a paper wallet into a safe and send a little bit to it knowing that you just "magically" transported money into that safe while it was locked and nobody on earth, even you, can get it back out without opening it.  Send it to a friend on the other side of the world for practically free in less than an hour.
Blockchain technology doesn't work without incentives.  This means that bitcoin (or some other underlying cryptocurrency) has to have value for ht technology to work at all.  That's what crypto is really about.  Digital Scarcity.  Owning bitcoin supports development of it's Blockchain for future tech by increasing scarcity.  Of course you could have the same effect by destroying some, but why not hold onto it, just in case.  Think of BTC as a bunch of tickets to use the Blockchain, because that's really what it is.
Discounts.  I took advantage of the Newegg sale giving $150 off a $500 order and bought some badass computer parts.  Gyft gift cards are something like 5% off.  If you are verified through circle, you can even use your credit card to buy and take advantage of sales without exposing yourself to the volatility.
But to be honest, bitcoin may not be for you yet.  You have a robust first world banking system; a few billion people do not.  You likely don't own a business and aren't concerned with the 2-3% fees attached to those credit cards you use, whereas with Bitpay you could have 0% fees, no volatility risk.  You might not have ever had to go without your card for a few days because some asshole swiped your number while you were buying pampers.
Point is, there are lots of rational reasons to own BTC.

@_date: 2017-02-05 20:21:57
That's because I wouldn't define the stage we are in currently as a bull run, all of these smaller spikes and leveling offs characterize the 'volatilic rise' stage.  All of this happened before the 2013 bubbles too, just in a shorter timespan and 1/10 &amp; 1/100th the scale respectively.

Not regular inkjet ink... ink solvent.  It basically partially dissolves the plastic substrate you printing on then mixes it with the ink.  Once it outgasses, you are left with the original substrate now with the pattern embedded in it.  If you use ink solvent printed vinyl for a QR code, you should be able to leave it outdoors in the elements and direct sunlight for several years and still be able to scan it.  Way better than paper.

This doesn't make sense.... until a block is validated, miners just mine on the header.  If they happen to win before the block is verified it results in an empty block.  Just means less transactions make it through and a backlog is created, but this is no problem if you have bigger blocks.

You do not risk losing any money by holding or even sending because in the worst case scenario your sent transaction is on the wrong chain, and you still have the bitcoin.  The only place you risk losing is if you **accept** bitcoin on the wrong chain, which nobody will risk doing.  Either transactions will have to be confirmed on both chains until there is a winner, or bitcoin grinds to a halt.

The correlation is not with good news but rather with hype.  Many of us refer to this as the hype cycle.  We are at the low point in the hype cycle right now, where both good and bad news have little effect on the price, so it is relatively stable.  Soon we will enter a positive feedback loop of hype seemingly driven by the mainstream media, but actually driven by new adoption (speculative mania) and amplified by the media.  At this point all bad news will be ignored and all good news will cause further price increases.  This will peak and be followed by a crash, during which good and bad news will oscillate the price until it finds a new equilibrium, which is where we are today.

It depends on how you define "SegWit".  If it's defined as the current Soft fork implementation being proposed by Core (SegWit as a softfork or SWAS), you are 100% correct.
If however you are referring to "SegWit" as Segregated Witness, a transaction malleability fix that can be implemented either by hard or soft fork... I honestly don't know many people who don't want it on the BU side.

It's really the miners that have the power here.  If a superminority of hash power are the only ones that upgrade, the fork fails and nothing changes.  If a supermajority of hash power upgrades, the fork succeeds and the old one fails.
The problem with a hard for occurs when the upgrade is roughly 50/50, meaning no clear winner.  In this case both forks are potentially valid, so neither truly is.
Users on a bad chain will see the longer one and be prompted to upgrade.

I don't see why the block propagation speed of Chinese miners is an issue.  They have subsidized electricity, but shitty bandwidth.  If they can't find a way to increase their bandwidth, they become unprofitable and drop from the network leaving room for others with a reasonable 21st Century internet connection.  To cater to centralized mining is to create more mining centralization.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:59:04
a 50/50 split is very hard to maintain... if one side or the other looks to be gaining advantage at all, hashpower will flow to it very rapidly.  Any gain by either side creates a positive feedback loop that rapidly results in a clear winner because miners never want to be on the losing chain... if they are they lose money.

Hi Jonny.  I think we may have gotten off on the wrong foot.  What we have here is semantic argument and I'm pretty sure neither of us is completely right or wrong.  I appreciate you kindly asking for an explanation.  I apologize for being curt before, but I was busy at work.
As you said in your quote from Wikipedia:


This is correct, but but Bitcoin is an atypical CS problem.  Normally if you have an inefficient solution that does not scale well, you can keep adding hardware to increase effective capacity; it's just the rate at which capacity is increased is diminished as throughput grows.  For example if you have too many views of your webpage, you can add servers to increase your effective capacity without changing any of the underlying processes.
I run a node on an 8-core machine with 16 GB of ram, 3TB of disk space and gigabit internet.  My rig is capable of handling an order of magnitude more transactions than the bitcoin network is currently feeding it without any improvements, yet the speed of the network does not increase.  This is because currently the network is designed to **not** scale beyond the 7 transactions per second allowed by the current blocksize.  
While the optimizations that have been added help the system scale at an increased rate up to a certain limit, there is absolutely zero scaling beyond it, a brick wall that is the result of the code and not the hardware running it.  This is what I mean when I say that Bitcoin does not scale.
I do understand your point and always welcome increased efficiency, but the fact of the matter is that if you can throw an infinite amount of resources at any program and it does not increase throughput, it cannot be said to scale.

The Antpool block was obviously mined while they were still validating the last block.  It's probably not completely empty because they had a tx of their own to post.
They have to mine empty blocks until the last on is verified or risk being orphaned.  What are they supposed to do?  Shut down their mining equipment until they know they can safely create a full block?

If UASF SegWit activates with minority hashrate and miners decided to hard fork to BU which does not acknowledge SegWit's rules, then they would be able to steal all SegWit balances on the forked chain. This isn't a problem without SegWit because normally you still need Private Keys to move funds regardless of a fork.
**It's funny but what SegWit as a soft fork amounts to is an ever increasing bounty on a non-segwit persistent hard fork.**
PSA: if a SegWit activates and you recieve funds to a SegWit address, they will not be yours on both chains in the event of a BU hard fork.

So, (please humor me here) in the event of SegWit activation, if somebody sent me a a SegWit output to a P2PKH address, what would the status of those funds be on a forked chain that doesn't recognize the witness?

The innovation of Peter Todd's insight was that is should be possible to add additional PoW after a coin has already launched.  That way, when they become ASIC solved, you can add a new Algo.

Core has no interest in ever raising the blocksize, it's not even on the roadmap.  IBLT is a stall; mark my words, Core will find a problem with it.  SegWit is a stall, albeit an amazingly beneficial stall in regards to transaction malleability and fraud proofs, a stall nonetheless.
Core's only interest is not allowing bitcoin to scale beyond whatever amount the community can stand in the near term so they can force a full block fee market and mass exodus to the Lightning Network because Bitcoin will be too expensive.  That is what I disagree with.
@_date: 2016-01-31 20:07:03
Right.  I'm not saying the decreased supply will have no effect, just that the halving itself will be a non-event.

SegWit breaks fungibility completely.  It makes two kinds of coins SegWit-bitcoin (Bitcoin that has been the output of even one SegWit tx) and regular bitcoin.  Personally, I will never accept the former because in the event of a non-segwit hard fork, it truly becomes anyonecanspend and is subject to theft on the other chain.  As long as I don't accept any as payment, I can hodl on both chains.  Honeybadger dgaf about blocksize wars.

Gold is good as money because it is:
* Scarce
* Durable - Doesn't rust away
* Portable - High value to weight ratio
* Verifiable - Unique color, soft so can be bitten and leave marks

* Divisible - not great, but can be spit into coins

Eventually, one fork or the other will die.  When that happens any coins mined on the now dead fork will cease to exist.  If this case the miners will have wasted the hashpower they could have pointed at the surviving chain.

Thanks for making the effort to explain. It's more nuanced than I originally stated and not as worrisome, still in that unlikely scenario it would be possible to lose coins on the other fork.  
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:53:50
I think it's really more of a feedback loop.  Greater hashrate supports a higher price, which makes it more profitable, after that, yes hashrate does track profitability.  Eventually an equilibrium is reached or one side dies.
I suppose we will have a chance to find out.

@_date: 2017-03-14 11:15:56
I don't think that's correct... That would be even LESS fungible if you couldn't mix inputs.  I believe if **even one** of your inputs is from a SegWit tx, your entire output becomes SegWit.  Somebody please correct me if I am wrong.   
Edit 1: for clarification all non-segwit inputs of a mixed tx are converted to SegWit before the tx occurs.
Edit 2: you can always send a SegWit output to a regular p2pkh or p2sh address, but it costs you an additional, non-discounted tx to do so.

Not true if SegWit is activated and you recieve funds to a SegWit address prior to a BU fork.  In this scenario, you will not have any coins on the BU chain because SegWit outputs are 'anyone can spend' and will immediately be spent by the first miner that forks.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:05:30


Bitcoin is only king of crypto because it has many, many times over the highest market cap and hashrate.  Take one of those away and the other will rapidly follow.
Sipa has called changing the PoW algorithm over blocksize FUD.  If it's going to be done, it won't be done by core.  Pretty much nobody thinks this is a viable option, far from economic consensus.
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:35:37
They absolutely are not.  They are resolved when one chain has overwhelmed the other by hashing power, so that the minority chain will never be the longest.  The only way this is not the case is when the hard fork includes a change in the PoW algorithm.

what?  If there is a prolonged hard fork, commerce will cease entirely until it is resolved.  Nobody will buy coins from any miner on either chain because either could be invalid.  Liquidity will be nil and the price will drop like a stone.  Which is why it won't last long.  Nature abhors a vacuum.

Correlation does not necessarily imply causation.  I would read all of these charts referenced together as "full blocks are causing rising fees &amp; increased confirmation times which in turn is causing both a decrease in Bitcoin market dominance and an increase in BU adoption."

In my mind there are only two reasons to ever think about changing PoW:

* The miners collectively decide to raise the 21M bitcoin cap in order to pay themselves a higher subsidy.
Any other reason is beyond reckless.

"DOSing" the network becomes a much **worse** problem when the block size is limited, not improved.  If someone spams the network with a limited blocksize, they can drive up fees and cause transactions that would confirm just fine in the absence of an artificial limit.  Leaving the blocksize low doesn't restrict spam attacks, it makes them more effective.

In all fairness, something like this did happen to bitcoin in the early days.  IIRC, in 2010 someone exploited a bug and mined several billion bitcoin.  Of course, bitcoin was very small then and worth practically nothing so it was patched and ~~hard~~ soft forked without too much fuss.

That argument never made sense to me.  Sure there is a blocksize that that would become a problem at, but you could buy a machine capable of of running an 8GB block node right now; it's just expensive.  Technology gets cheaper all the time.

Miners don't set the price.  Miners only provide the supply part of the price equation, which in Bitcoin is extremely consistant per the schedule.  Demand is larglely what drives price.  The irony is that the lower prices go, the more mined coins miners have to sell to keep operating, increasing supply and driving price lower, leading to a "vicious cycle".  
Once demand starts to increase heading into a bull run, the opposite is true.  As the price increases, miners retain more of their mined coin, restricting supply and driving price up, a "virtuous cycle".

Response to your edit.  Manipulation is not a concern with S Pair's proposal.  The block size limit is a function of the average miner set blocksize, meaning in order to manipulate it to a meaningful degree, you'd have to have over 51% of the hashrate anyway.

In the original protocol spec there was no differentiation between miners and full nodes, as hashing power was decentralized.  The advent of GPU / FPGA / ASICs separated the two, in the process stripping nearly all power from non mining full nodes.
The majority of miners **absolutely** control the fork unless POW also is changed.  Because they secure the chain and can actively attack any alternate chain.

Bitcoin is built to have a static rate of supply.  Roughly every two weeks, the difficulty adjusts to ensure new blocks are found every 10 minutes on average.  Bitcoin is unique this way, because supply cannot increase/decrease if demand does.  If there were no (or a much higher) blocksize, transactions would likely continue to grow along with price, but blocks are capped.

By holding, you are contributing to aggregate demand.  Since bitcoin supply (production) is fixed, demand is the key determining factor in price.  If bitcoin's price is to rise, we need a lot more people to hold.

Definitely reads as though they want a 2MB hardfork before activating segwit.  The plot thickens.  Assuming this is legit, I wonder what Core's response will be?  
Since all the core developers are independent, can they even ever legitimately give a unified response?  I doubt they will get consensus to by their own standards.

The majority of the coin Satoshi mined back when Bitcoin started were Pay to Public Key (P2PK) as opposed to Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH).  It's estimated he mined 750k coins himself and the vast majority has never moved.  Because of the way Bitcoin works, it's impossible to tell if they have been just lying dormant or the Private keys are lost forever.
Fun Fact: since the early coins are all P2PK, they could potentially have their private keys found by an advanced enough quantum computer.

I would bet on the day of the split, you acquired BCH for a $0 cost basis... So 100% gains.  If you sell under a year it's short term which is the same as income.  If you sell a year and a day later it's long term capital gains.

OTC or not, if you do enough volume it's going to begin to affect the price.  It doesn't hit an exchange order book but it does exhaust some of the OTC supply at the current price.  What happens when all of that supply is gone and no new is entering the OTC markets?  OTC prices go up and people arbitrage against exchanges, driving them up.
This can happen quite slowly, but there is no avoiding it.

What it does is creates a new class of node.  If you verify the transactions and prune them of all witness data, you end up with a "pruned node" or "half node" or "partial node".  Because of this new option, we may actually see the number of true full nodes actually **decline** if SegWit is implemented. 
Edit: I am aware pruning already exists, but SegWit looks to provide much more efficient pruning.

Its also close to the value of all the gold ever mined.  Given that bitcoin has a much higher velocity that traditional money (it's sent faster), we actually don't need as much of it because it turns over much faster.  At the "House" level, bitcoin is the dominant currency in the world.  Hard to go up from there unless a massive amount is destroyed or we colonize other worlds.

By 'Bitcoin Cash owners' you mean everyone that held Bitcoin at the time of the fork.  This is based off a previous Forbes article that says BCH forking generated income.  This is an indefensible position because any asshole could fork an open source project set up a BS exchange and cause all Bitcoin holders a taxable income event without their knowledge or consent.
I have no doubt that the IRS will eventually treat the split as new asset you acquired with a cost basis of $0.  That means if you hold it for a year and a day from the split, you can sell it and only pay long term capital gains.

I get the desire for defensive patents, but I think a non-profit company should be created to hold them.  If Blockstream (or any other bitcoin company holding defensive patents) goes bankrupt and is forced to liquidate or gets acquired by a bank, the new owner will be under no obligation to use the patents defensively and will be free to sue anyone who infringes.
Any company holding a large portfolio of these patents will make an excellent target for acquisition (which may be an exit strategy for the current investors).
This risk can be obviated by forming a separate non-profit entity for the sole purpose of holding bitcoin patents for defensive purposes of all members of the ecosystem.
Per their FAQ, Blockstream has expressed a desire to do what I have stated, though it has not been done yet.  This needs to happen.

What version of the client were you using?  Was it Core or QT?  Did you ever restore from a backup or is this original installation?  Did you move computers?
Old school QT created 100 addresses randomly and kept them in a LevelDB file called wallet.dat; if you backed up the file and overran the created addresses, your backup would not contain your change address.
In late 2016 (I forget the version) they changed Core (rebranded from QT) to generate HD wallets by default.  If you created the wallet after this, it's HD and will def have ALL of your change addresses.  But if you imported an old wallet.dat, it won't.
The fact that you said "Bitcoin-QT" leads me to believe you made the wallet on an old client.  If you have another backup somewhere (usually created by either copying or renaming wallet.dat), it may contain your change addresses for those coins.
Good luck, bro.

Well, it was kinda different in the past with G-Hash.IO, they were a true pool that had lower fees than everyone else because of their scale, so they actively advertised how big they were until they got blowback and people moved away.  This is different.  It's not a pool, but a single company that produces their own ASICs.  There is nobody to leave the pool.


I doubt it, all miners sell most of their bitcoin when they get it to cover operation expenses.... they'd all look the same anyway.

My personal theory is that bitcoin (or cryptocurrency as a technology overall) is following the growth pattern of the S-Curve of technological adoption, characterized by a series of fractally repeating exponentially increasing Gartner Hype cycles; each one roughly an order of magnitude larger than the proceeding.
Normal theories of monetary exchange rates don't really apply yet because most currencies typically don't see an exponential increase in user base on such short timescales.

It measures movements of old coins.  If you haven't moved 1 bitcoin in 1 day, it has 1 Bitcoin/Day that would be destroyed if you move it to another address.  If you have .25 bitcoin and haven't moved it for 4 days, it would also yield 1 Bicoin/Day of destruction when you moved it.

Coinbase is an exchange, not a wallet.  Whenever I buy, I transfer out as soon as the transaction is complete.  This is the same scenario for every other exchange, except for bitsquare I assume.  They even offer the option of their 'vault', which is multisig, so you do control your own keys.

Signing the private key indirectly reveals the public key.  This makes funds stored in any UTXO of this private key potentially vulnerable to a quantum attack (which in theory could calculate the private key from the public).  
This is the same level of risk as re-using a bitcoin address because the first time you use it, the public key is published to the blockchain.  If you never sign a message or publish a transaction, there is no way to know your public key or even to prove for certain that a private key for the address you supplied actually exists.
If you must sign a message with a private key, best practice is to send the coins to a different address after to avoid reuse of the same private key.  This can be just another address in the same wallet, but would be an on-chain tx and would cost a fee.
The risk is small, especially at present, but it will only grow in the future as quantum tech advances.
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:50:21
You can't do this because of credit card charge backs.  If you pay with a credit card, you can reverse the transaction.  By contrast, if you send Bitcoin to somebody, the transaction is irreversible.

I honestly think drawing the line here semantically is pretty simple.  Anything that uses the bitcoin genesis block and at least the first six months of the original chain is a fork of bitcoin.  Anything that does not is an altcoin.  Speech on r/bitcoin should be allowed on any pending (based on the longest chain) or active hard forks.  When a fork occurs, you have to wait to see which fork becomes the new longest chain, and effectively the new bitcoin.
If we do, as a technology, use miner voting as a the trigger for a contentious change, then we do open ourselves up to a fork that lifts the 21M bitcoin cap as it is in miners' near-term self interest to do so.   I imagine if that happens we will see an alterative mining algorithm hard fork with the 21M cap intact.  Now that will be a diamond hard fork.

Multibit HD or Electrum (both SPV wallets that don't download the blockchain) should allow you to import a wallet.dat file.  I haven't used either one in a long time.  
If it's not encrypted, you can manually import private keys, but that can cause issues with change addresses if you ever use the old client.  Best to sweep the whole thing.

Bitcoin is totally trustless if you use it properly.  But to do so, you have ro learn how to manage and backup your own keys.  If you use bitcoin in this trustless manner (and never hand over your bitcoin or private key in hope of a profit) then there is no possible way to fall for a scam.

Then why are you acting like you're new?  Is your total experience just the latest bubble and the run up to it?  This is what bitcoin does and has done 4 times now.
The downward trend is over and for the past several months it has been channeling laterally between $250 &amp; $320.  Before the last bubble, it had the same behavior only with a spread of $7 instead of $70.  Expect this to continue for a while, its called stabilization.  
Bitcoin is still illiquid with big players so jumps up and down with their whims.  It's the long term trends that matter.  The last bull run was so massive it's still taking the markets time to absorb.  I still fully expect a bull market, but not for a while, and it won't take off like a rocket again until it hits the $700-800 mark.

Both of your contentions are semantic.  "Compute" implies there is a process that transforms the data in some way, since the addresses are already in the blockchain, you aren't computing anything.

Exchanges allow you to to trade Tether for BTC.  The recent pump may have been caused by stolen Tether buying BTC.  If so, the exchange can likely reverse the transactions (because the stolen Tether is now worthless), but this would mean an instant sell of $30M in BTC.

They owe a metric shit ton of money to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank (ECB).  Normally when a country finds itself in this position, it just prints more money devaluing the currency and making the debt easier to pay.  Since Greece has the Euro as the currency, it can't print more euros without permission from the ECB, whom it owes a metric shit ton of money.  So in the absence of debt forgiveness, the only real way out is to ditch the euro and pay back the euro debt in devalued drachmas.  [Hyperflation]( the same thing that happened in Germany

This is actually old info in most cases.  Change addresses for paper wallets used to be a huge problem with old wallets.  If you scan a single private key (not sweep) in mycelium and spend some, it automatically sends the change back to the originating address.  
Of course while addresses should not be reused for privacy reasons, leaking a little data is nowhere near as bad a irrevocably losing all change from a transaction.  Also, once you spend once from an individual private key, that key is no longer quantum safe.  Bad for long term cold storage, but not an immediate threat.
Try it yourself with a small amount.

Good God man!  Do some fucking research.
1. Download this  and run offline from a know good OS.  Encrypt and print multiple copies of multiple paper wallets with the same PW.  Use these for Long term storage only, don't give out addresses, don't reuse.
2. Nobody ever knows any addresses ever belong to a deterministic wallet unless they know the seed; they just appear random.  they are just as secure and anonymous as anything else only way easier to manage, use them.
3. Don't fucking use QT.
4. Don't fucking use QT.  But to answer your question it generates new addressed when needed, so backups can become stale... just do HD instead.
5. Technically yes, you can use a blockchain explorer to see what address the change went to, but practically... No, don't fucking use QT.
6. HD addresses are infinitite for all practical purposes.  QT addresses are not.  QT only stores 100 to start and generates new random ones as needed.  If you lose any of them without a backup of every single one, you'll never get them back.  It's a bad system and not meant to be used in modern day.
7. No.  Deterministic seeds are larger random numbers than even bitcoin privkeys.  Hashed so no way to reverse.  Brute forse would take longer than the universe's lifespan.
8. Both, Electrum or Mycellium (android) for Hot wallet, Paper for cold.  Hot you use freely, cold you never touch but to transfer to hot.  simple.
9. Boot from known good read-only OS.  Load bitaddress.org offline.  Generate min 3 copies of a bunch of paper wallets encrypted all with same password.  Print to PDF (optional).  Test one wallet on Mycelium (android) advanced import to make sure pw is good.  Destroy tested wallet.  Laminte. Transfer bitcoin into paper.  Keep one copy in a safe, one copy at someone else's house and one in an undisclosed location.  Set up Electrum on PC, or preferably Mycellium on an Android, backup seed and store with paper.  Load a small amount into Mycellium for spending.  Done.  Easy.

Correct.  All I am saying is that if a hard fork has not happened by the time a UASF activated, it would serve as a catalyst for one.
@_date: 2017-04-01 12:45:07


What I am describing has nothing to do with a replay attack.  The SegWit txs are literally not locked by a Private Key according to old nodes.


If 95% of the hashrate follows SegWit, any hard fork away would be crushed.  We would have consensus that SegWit is Bitcoin.  With UASF, that's not the case.
@_date: 2016-02-06 14:17:54
Right.  My comment was more about how open source projects work in github.  I believe only 5 people have commit privileges on the repo, and one of them is Gavin.  Maxwell gave his up and i don't know if it's been reinstated.  While i was using a bit of hyperbole, my point is that actual release consensus is an informal process of those 5 or 6 individuals, which makes it highly centralized.  They could choose to ignore all others if they wanted to.  I pinged you becase i was being ignored as a troll and wanted someone knowledgable but favorable to explain things.  Thanks.

Basically, SegWit was implemented as a soft fork under on the condition that it would get 95% miner adoption to to activate.  That hasn't happened.  As of now more miners are actually signalling Bitcoin Unlimited, which is a hard fork that does not enforce SegWit rules (this is important).
Since it has become apparent SegWit as originally spec'd will not activate, a number of people are now advocating a User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) to activate SegWit without overwhelming miner support (the hashrate that makes Bitcoin the most secure cryptocurrency).
In order to achieve SegWit as a backwards compatible soft fork (instead of hard forking), the decision was made to make SegWit transactions appear to old nodes as any-can-spend, which basically means the old nodes will recognize any transaction from that address as valid even if it wasn't signed by a private key.  The new SegWit nodes don't and refuse to propogate the transaction or accept it in a mined block.
This is all fine and dandy as long as the SegWit chain is the only chain.  But, as I said before, Bitcoin Unlimited was forked from a prior version of Bitcoin Core and as such does not enforce extra rules.
 
People are always told not to worry about a hard fork because if they do nothing, they end up with coins on both chains.  If SegWit activates as a UASF then people will start using SegWit transactions.  Depending on the wallet client, the may not even **realize** that they are.  Bitcoin from these transactions end up in SegWit outputs. 
All a miner has to do to create a hard fork to BU is to mine a block over 1MB that others then mine on.  This is a credible threat because BU has more hashpower signalling it than SegWit currently.  When doing so, a miner can easily change his code to send himself all of the coins in SegWit outputs and all BU nodes will see it as legit.  This means that if you use SegWit, knowingly or not, in the event of a subsequent hard fork to BU all of your SegWit outputs coin will be stolen on the BU chain.  
If the BU chain does not immediately die, then you have lost money.  If the BU chain becomes the dominant SHA-256 chain, then you probably lost a lot of money.
**PSA: if you use SegWit activated by UASF, don't expect the coins you hold the private keys to to be yours on a Bitcoin Unlimited fork.**

Your assumption is that price will follow the "economic majority", whatever definition you want to give that.  I don't think this is correct.  The Robin Hood devs made the same mistake and sold a bunch of the ETC they syphoned from the DAO only to see it rebound after.  I believe there will be a huge period of instability, then price will follow the hashrate creating a feedback loop.  A hard fork will never happen without majority hashrate, so you can knock your 40% BU scenario straight out. 
BU + 8 megabyte is nearly 50% already.

You can't force a device to sign a bitcoin transaction the same as tricking PGP into decrypting something.  The device would have to be present when you choose to sign the transaction, and have to differentiate the signature from normal processing noise without a reference; making it infeasable.  Electromagnetic shielding would render it completely ineffective.
@_date: 2017-04-14 23:45:34
With less than a majority hashrate, UASF will simply fork itself off of the network.  With a majority of coerced signalling hashrate, UASF will just provide an incentive for miners to hard fork.  The increased activity caused by the fork combined with the pre-fork difficulty will cripple the 1MB chain long before SegWit activates providing relief.  Remaining miners will flee to the chain that has a chance to survive.  The hashrate will grow more and more lopsided until the only choice to keep SegWit alive will be a PoW change hard fork.

For non-deterministic addresses, it works like this
Random Input -----&gt; **SHA256** ----- &gt; Privkey ---&gt; **ECDSA** ----&gt; Pubkey -----&gt; **SHA256/RIPE160/Base58** -----&gt; Address
1. You can always generate bunch of Private Keys offline, just SHA256 a random number.  Bitaddress is great at this if you use an offline copy.  But you are better off using an HD wallet.  I don't use Electrum, but I assume you can Gen offline.  You'll have to write down a 12 word seed.
2. No, you only ever need an address to receive.  Public keys and addresses can be derived at any time from the private key.
3. No, you can see unspent outputs with only an address.
4. You'll never need your pubkey ever, it's designed to be hidden.  You can derive it from your Privkey at anytime.
5. You don't ever need it for practical purposes.
6. According to QT, you don't need to know them, just use them.  you can always use the console command dumpprivkey to key the private key of any address in your QT wallet.  Don't do any of this... get Electrum.
7. In the console dumpprivkey &lt;address&gt; after unlocking you wallet.dat
@_date: 2017-04-08 12:04:57


I am against your proposal, but I'd like to commend you for thinking about it the right way.  It is literally an act of coercion of the miners and should not be undertaken unless the economic vast majority is solidly in agreement (which I fear it is not, but could be wrong).  Without near unanimous support, it runs the risk of backfiring completely and forcing a hardfork coinsplit instead, leaving the SegWit chain the hashpower minority.
Personally, I'm not for SegWit either as I believe on-chain scaling needs to outrun tier 2 in order to ensure it doesn't become as rent-seeking as the current banking system.
For what it's worth, you sound very reasonable and thanks for urging rationality amongst your proposal's supporters.  It's obvious you are doing what you believe is best for Bitcoin, as are most, even if they disagree.
   
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:16:10
Damn dude... some of us have jobs...
1. Yes.  They are all in your wallet (wallet.dat) and QT creates new addresses as needed.
2.  Yes.  Provided you are online and FULLY synced and up to date which can take days.  This is only the case for QT, any other wallet will just connect to the network via SPV and work instantly.
3. QT tracks all the addresses in the wallet and shows you a total.  QT NEVER reuses addresses, everytime you spend it will send the unspent transaction amounts of all input addresses to a new change address also in your wallet.  Do not try to monitor QT remotely via addresses, because if you spend your money will appear to be gone, but will just be in a new address in your wallet.  They have HD watch wallets in other programs i believe.
4.  QT has access to all the private keys, default is not to specify which ones you want to spend from and let QT decide.  You can use the advanced options to specify which addresses you want spend from, but this doesn't involve the private key in the UI at all, just addresses.  QT manages all keys and addresses for you.
5. Debatable, but most seem to say yes.  Depends on the amount and how paranoid you are.  If you really want security by a Trezor.  I prefer individual encrypted paper wallet laminated and stored in multiple redundant locations for cold storage, but whatevs.
6. Yes.  Address re-use is detrimental to privacy and makes addresses vulnerable to quantum attack.  You don't have to do any of that though.  If you use QT or any modern wallet (PC: Electrum, Android Mycellium, iOS: CoPay) ALL of this shit is done for you.  With HD wallets addresses are infinite and easily recoverable.  You are making it much harder than it has to be.
7. I don't use Electrum. but it's pretty straightforward.  Anything is simpler than QT.

@_date: 2017-04-08 16:40:20
If the only way to transact via Bitcoin is to use the LN (because bitcoin txs are to expensive themselves) then LN operators hold a monopoly on the means to move Bitcoin.  Since LN hub operation is a staked and profitable activity, it is naturally centralizing as hub operators with more BTC earn more BTC, they begin to pool.  Open payment channels become bank accounts and hubs become banks.  Due to monopoly power, prices rise.
None of this is an issue if you can actually say, "nah, too expensive.  I'll just send a Bitcoin tx."

If you are new, you probably shouldn't use QT.  It's very inconvenient.  Electrum is a light wallet you can use to get your feet wet and QT is actually not a very good modern wallet.  It lacks features like Hierarchical Deterministic keys that let you generate nigh-unlimited keys from a single seed.
To answer your question, the Address you see when you click receive is a hash of one of your public keys.  Addresses should never be re-used.  In modern wallets this is handled with an HD wallet from a seed, but QT still generates 100 random privkeys in advance of use on demand and stores them in wallet.dat.
QT is also made to make privkeys pretty much invisible to the end user.  You can get around this by using the console with the dumpwallet command, but you are better off just using a better wallet.  If you screw up, you could actually lose bitcoin.

I'm not referring to an arbitrary hard fork, I'm referring to the specific implementation of BU that currently has more hashrate signalling it than does SegWit.  Which is treats SegWit outputs exactly the same as an old version of Core.

I call it "the bond bubble" because it was caused by the Fed purchasing bonds through "Quantitative Easing" (really printing money), which artificially inflates the bond prices, sending yields (interest rates) down.

Adam, a UASF with a minority or even less than a supermajority of hashpower is extremely dangerous.  This marks the first time I have ever seen a member of the Core team actually advocate it.  Because of the way the soft fork was implemented, SegWit outputs will be anyone-can-spend on any coin-split fork based on a prior version of the Core client (i.e. Bitcoin Unlimited).
This means that after activation, every UTXO stored in a SegWit locking script can be stolen by the first miner to mine a block &gt; 1MB on that side of the coin-split.  People are constantly told that as long as they hold onto their private keys, in the event of a hard fork their funds are safe, but with SegWit, that's just not true.  Any miner can change their software to spend SegWit users coins and all BU nodes will respect those transactions.  
**What UASF SegWit adoption amounts to  an ever increasing bounty on a Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork, in which all SegWit users lose their coins.**
This is not BUs fault, it's because Core chose a soft fork hack that removes the inherent cryptographic protections of the protocol by all nodes and instead relies on node enforcement of Privkey protection by a subset of nodes via new rules.
This of course is not a problem if you stick to Core's original assertion that SegWit can only be activated by a 95% majority hashrate, as there would be no danger of such a fork.  Please rethink your position or at least inform users that they run this risk if they choose to use SegWit.

When you buy something with bitcoin through Bitpay, the merchant has the option to get some or all of the money in USD at the exchange rate at the time of sale.  The majority of merchants take 100% USD, which effectively like you selling your bitcoin on the open market at the time of purchase.

Right, but those people do not have to be online with a staked payment channel larger than the amount they are trying to receive.

Technically you don't have to be online all the time, but you cannot receive any payments while offline and nothing will route through your node.  By online, I mean PKs exposed to the internet on an active wallet.

If there is no transaction history, then the seed you restored is not an exact match of the seed for the wallet you were using before.  Good practice is to try to restore on a different device before deleting the wallet from a working device to ensure your backup is good.  
Since all of the words are acceptable words in the backup dictionary they are likely the correct words, but you may have them out of order.  Jaxx displays a backup seed as 3 lines of text,. If you don't copy them all left to right for each line, it will give you the wrong order and a bad backup.  Fortunately, there should not be to many ways you could have messed up so you should be able to try them all.

Depends on the delay in reaction of the network to the increase in transactions.  If there is no delay there effectively is no cap, so why even have one?
Even if if there is a delay, this method could be gamed by flooding the network with cheap spam transactions... something that has happened a lot in the past as "stress tests", meaning anyone could raise the cap at will for an inexpensive cost.  
I suppose if you made it expensive to raise the cap it might be worth exploring.

I agree we should seek to incentivize mining decentralization where possible; but the issue at hand, the low block size limit, does not in any way incentivize miners to solo-mine or join a smaller pool.  More can be done, but that should not be a factor in this debate.


If we increase the blocksize, the bitcoin blockchain will be able to handle more transactions and maintain low fees (the aggregate of many small transaction fees will satisfy miners).  Business adoption of Bitcoin Blockchain technology will incentivise many businesses to run their own full nodes as the cost is negligible on a business scale.  If the bitcoin blockchain becomes the standard for digital denomination of assets, I expect we will see far more than 100,000 full nodes.
Edit: spelling

This letter wasn't signed by Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn orJeff Garzik.  All three of them have been core devs on the project for a very long time and I think all communicated directly with Satoshi.
What's more, they are responsible for submitting BIP100 and BIP101, which are the only proposals resulting in eventual block sizes over 8MB and the only implementations being taken seriously by the community.
Can anyone else on the list propose something reasonable that lets bitcoin scale and not some external apparatus like the lightning network?

Go to bitaddress.org and create a paper wallet.  This should really be done on a locally saved copy of the website while disconnected from the internet.  If there is the slightest chance of malware on your machine you should boot from read-only media in a trusted OS like tails.  
Password protect the wallet (BIP0038) and you can save to pdf or print without fear of exposing the private key.  Make multiple copies to store in redundant locations so as not to lose in case of fire, etc.  Laminate them to protect against getting wet.
Be sure to test it with a small amount first and make sure you can spend it.  Don't xfer the bulk until you feel comfortable everything is secure ans retrievable.  Once you spend from a paper wallet, you should consider it burned and transfer any remaining n bitcoin to a fresh one.
Have fun!

Liberty reserve was a single, central point of failure... no vision of bitcoin is that centralized.
I will always run node personally.  I can always afford to.  There are many others that always will as well.  In 20 years, 8GB will be as laughably small amount as 8MB is today.  
With limited blocks, the fees will be far too high for any non-corporation to actually make a bitcoin blockchain transaction.  That is the real danger... that's the real centralization. If that's the case, bitcoin becomes no better than the oligarchic banking system it was created to get away from.

About 8 MB when he originally proposed them, yes.  BIP101 is 1000x larger and meant not to be a bandaid.  We will likely need the lighting network or something in addidtion, but the reason for the massive propsal is because he wanted a more permanant solution.  8GB blocks would handle as many transactions as Visa &amp; Mastercard.

Not entirely true, you could also denominate a tranche of fiat the same way they are denominating these securities and then use them in a smart contract; but, it is far simpler to just use bitcoin as it's a native asset.

Honestly, it's not that people oppose Segwit in and of itself.  They oppose it for the fact that it is a one-time, limited net increase to blocksize throughput, with the larger goal of enablement of off-chain scaling.
I honestly think other side is not really opposed to off-chain scaling solutions like lightning &amp; sidechains; they just don't want them implemented at the cost of never ever scaling on-chain (beyond the humble ~70% increase of SegWit if fully adopted) which is the way things appear to be going.

If this is even a possibility then you are doing it wrong.  Make sure you have sole control over your private keys.  If you have enough to warrant spending $100 on, buy a Trezor.  If not, generate a password protected paper wallet offline from a known clean boot or backup a seed from Mycelium or copay before deleting.  Laminate any paper and make multiple copies in case of destruction.

I generally have left wing politics and been a avid Bitcoin enthusiast for years.  Bitcoin is simply better money.  It's a technology that, in and of itself, is not more partisan than thermonuclear warheads or can-openers.
Before Bitcoin, we had to trust governments with seigniorage simply because there is nobody else to trust.  It's nice to pontificate on gold based systems, but gold (and even silver) is impractical to transact with directly and IOUs for gold subject you to counterparty risk (untrusted 3rd parties).
Personally, I think people have a responsibility to pay their taxes and that the collective has some obligations to the individual.  (I am aware this is often an unpopular view here.)  This doesn't mean that I believe the government should have control over money which, after all, is private property.
I can reconcile these two concepts quite nicely.  Without having read the book itself, I can only conclude the author is ill-informed on the subject and full of the bile that can only come from an ardent partisan; who believes if the other side thinks it's right, then it has to be wrong.
tl;dr  It's science, bitches.

If you don't hold the asset for at least a year, it is subject to short term capital gains, which is effectively taxed at the same rate as income.

Almost all of the empty blocks mined are shortly after the last block, when the miner hasn't had time to validate it yet.  Until the last block is validated, including any transactions may invalidate the block they are trying to mine.

it's "sweeping" but yes, he is correct.  Reuse of addresses leaks information, not only about you, but anybody you transact with.  Also, money stored in a single address that has been spent from (ex. a paper wallet) is vulnerable to quantum attack because the public key is recorded on the blockchain when the transaction is signed.
If you have $100 to spare, get a Trezor.  Or just make a bunch of new paper wallets.

This is awesome, but in my opinion, not very likely anytime soon.  Netflix's business model relies on a passive subscription.  This is much easier to accomplish with a pull system like credit/debit cars than a push system like bitcoin.  Without it, if a customer lapses, you have to re-acquire them which is expensive.
I'm not saying it's by any means impossible, just that they have to make a strong enough case that it will be a net increase in subscriptions for them.
Edit: glanced over the article initially.  On re-read it refers to international customers that currently pay with gift cards.  Good use case.

GBTC can only buy new bitcoin as a fund if an "accredited investor" buys new shares.  All of the shares the plebs can buy are those previously purchased by accredited investor.  
By contrast, whenever anyone buys shares in the COIN ETF, the ETF itself will spend the (less fees) money purchasing new bitcoins to hold on the new user's behalf.

It's those policies that everbody hates.  When the fuck did Bitcoin become about following the rules of central authority or "trusted" third party?
 


No.  True consensus can only be reached by uncensored debate of the issues. The policies and actions of the moderators in this community are definitely anti-consensus in that regard.
@_date: 2015-09-02 13:34:08


I think we've come to the crux of the conflict.  As it stands now, on average blocks are half full and transaction count is growing exponentially.  You seem to think that we have time to avoid a constriction where the number of low fee transactions is much greater than bitcoin can handle.  I believe that if action is not taken right now, we will be dealing with perpetual full blocks and a fee market early next year, long before the lightning network is ready.


If we can't come to consensus now what makes anyone believe we will be able to in the future?

Some have already been lost, possibly a million or so back before it had value.  More will be lost to be sure, but bitcoin is divisible out to 8 decimal places.   So, if there were only one bitcoin left it could be divided into 100,000,000 satoshis.
If we eventually thing the smallest unit isn't divisible enough anymore, we can fork to increase the divisibility to any degree imaginable.  So we could take a single remaining satoshi and divide it into 21 million units.
tl;dr you can never lose all the bitcoin unless every last satoshi is gone.

Here is my issue:  If we develop a fee market by artificially limiting blocksize, then teir 2 solutions like the Lightning Network actually break down.
The trustlessness of the LN relies on the fact that if the counterparty tries anything shady, you can always publish to the bitcoin blockchain and override them.  But, if the fee to publish a single tx onto the Bitcoin Blockchain becomes higher than the amount in dispute, there counterparty has no disincentive to keep them honest.

Let's game theory this a bit.  
IMF announces they will be acquiring bitcoin.  They can't do it all at once because price will spike.  Speculators see this information and buy ahead of the IMF.  Price spikes.  IMF ceases buying, speculators get spooked, price crashes.  Wash, rinse, repeat... with increasing intensity.
By taking such action in a public manner the IMF will be manipulating (pumping) the bitcoin market.  Ironically, if they take this action publicly, the result is a hastening of the crisis they are trying to prepare for; which of course may happen anyway if they do nothing.

21's goal is to make devices like smartphones that continually create just enough bitcoin to write an entry into the blockchain.  The ability to do this becomes a system resource like RAM or storage.  The thought is that a huge host of apps utilizing the ability to write to an indelible ledger will be run on these devices and enable the Internet of Things.
If Blockstream has its way and a fee market develops, the mined bitcoin on 21's devices will be useless for their intended purpose.

Nope.  You could make a sidechain that dynamically adjusts exchange rate as the sidechain inflates.

This has been tried before with [eGold](  Backing a cryptocurrency with gold actually makes it less useful because it is now subject to the counter-party risk of losing the backing asset.  Say some government wanted to shut down HayekCoin; easy, just send the men with guns to take the gold.  There's also nothing to prevent the custodian from creating a fractional reserve by issuing more coins than they have gold for.
These are not a problem with bitcoin because the ledger is the asset.

Good luck with that.  I think you misunderstand how markets work.  The more you buy, the **higher** the price gets.  This is because you exhaust the cheapest coins in the order book first and drive the price up.  Of course $10k won't move the price much at all any any decen size exchange.  


Selling is the opposite of buying.  You actually push the price down.  If you bought and the then sold at the same base price you would lose money... and exchange fees on top of that.
It's not illegal at all if it wasn't obtained illegally.


No.  But in the US you'd have to pay short-term capital gains tax which is pretty much the same as income tax.

Circular logic and vague promises with absolutely no mention of how the thing actually works.  This is a clearer scam than Paycoin was... and that's saying something.

There are currently 1.477 Quadrillion divisible units of bitcoin.  As a store of value it can take as much capital as  is thrown at it.  As a medium of exchange, not so much, but it doesn't need to be used as a currency to hold value.  Gold isn't.

This is a fair criticism.  No straw-man intended.  Apologies.


Several people who share your opinions about the blocksize/fee tradeoff on the bitcoin blockchain have advocated the term.  I think it's derogatory to the other side because it implies that they are 'centralist'.


Agreed, both labels are somewhat derogatory, but i wouldn't mind being called a 'gigablocker' because at least it makes my position clear.


Me neither.  That's honestly why i was asking.  The best i can come up with are 'small block proponents' and 'large block proponents'.  Maybe 'layer 2 propoenents'? (I'm a fan of layer 2, i just want bigger blocks as well.)


This is where i disagree with you.  We need a short and simple non-derogatory way to refer to each side of the issue to help facilitate debate.  I don't like the way this has decsended into tribalism any more than you do.

What you are talking about is usually referred to as abstraction, and it is happening very rapidly, but takes time.
I realize you are new, but bitcoin is orders of magnitude simpler and easier to use than it was just 2 years ago.  Give it another 2-4 years of innovation before trying to introduce grandma to it.
And crypto is more than just a payment platform like credit cards or a new one based on them like Apple Pay, it is a new and unique money in and of itself.  Eventually, it won't just be credit cards people want to ditch, it will be the dollars they pay their credit card bills with.

At the the very end:


Why not?  With 2-way pegged sidechains each national currency can have it's own currency "backed" by bitcoin at 100% reserve.  These currencies will be bitcoin in fact, but at the same time not. They can float against bitcoin as countries print more money, but always have a mathematically proven exchange rate guaranteeing  100% reserve.

Bitcoin works on unspent transaction outputs (UXTO) whereas Ethereum uses smart contracts and address balances.

A change to the function of the protocol like that is known as a hard fork.  Even if the majority of miners moved over to the new fork, the majority of bitcoin users would likely not because their bitcoin would be devalued.  The hashrate on the old fork would plummet and new miners would come in as a gold rush.  Soon, the old mining cartel would switch back or lose their entire investment.  Game theory dictates they would see all of this coming and not try to fork bitcoin in this manner as they would only lose out on revenue.
Edit tldr:  It's the nodes that the users prefer to connect to that determines what bitcoin is, not the miners or the developers.

Because it doesn't make sense to lend out a deflationary asset for a long period of time (ex. mortgage).  If you have a sidechain that is 100% reserve but inflationary at an unpredictable rate, you stand a chance at making a profit in bitcoin by lending out 'fedcoin' as you call it at interest.

Answer: you wouldn't lend.  I call this "the mortgage problem".  That's why there must be an inflationary sidechain that inflates at an unpredictable rate within set boundaries (much like current fiat) with a 100% reserve.  Thus will enable loans to be made that are "backed by" bitcoin.

I've never been opposed to Segregated Witness.  It's a sound idea and a good transaction malleability fix.  I would prefer to see it implemented as a hard fork, but SegWit2x is acceptable.
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:14:34
A softfork is actually a rollout without of network functionality without any user consent by agreement between the devs and the miners.  Hard forks give users a choice.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:23:52
You are absolutely correct.  However this is true of any hard fork code that could be written at any time.  The difference is that (at least some) miners will actually run SegWit2x code.  Bitcoin-ABC guarantees a hardfork without even activating SegWit, but no significant hashrate supports it so it's a non-issue.
The 80% BIP91 threshold is just to activate SegWit.  After that where is running btc1 (or compatible) code will hard fork 90 days later, regardless of what percentage of hashrate is actually running it at the time.
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:45:55


Debatable, given that Segwit2x is basically what the miners agreed to in the Hong Kong agreement, it was actually Core that rejected it.  But I must admit, it certainly hasn't hurt the chances of SegWit2x adoption.
My question is: Will you be satisfied if SegWit2x is adopted with the 2MB Hard Fork as planned?  Or only if SegWit is adopted with no HF?

Familiar with the concept, but what future advantage does laying their mining equipment at idle give them when they could instead be making money?  None.  Especially when their hash percentage is so less than 10%, they will have no discernable effect on difficulty at all.  The only reason they would pull their hashpower offline is if it were unprofitable to continue mining with it.  More likely, they are about to release a new batch of more efficient hardware and don't want to piss money away on old units.

Bitcoin-denominated loans are the key to bitcoin-denominated default.  If the borrower does not pay back you may have little recourse.
This is especially true if the price of bitcoin rises substantially over the term of the loan,  as has happened in the past.  I've personally seen people go belly up trying to pay back bitcoin loans worth much more than they borrowed in fiat and end up defaulting.  Much less risky to hodl.

Trust comes from the protocol.  Miners have to adhere to the protocol or the network will reject them.  I would say that trust is an emergent property of the network.

@_date: 2015-02-01 19:35:06
I agree.  I think mainstream adoption will happen so fast that Bitcoin will fundamentally be the same thing it is today.  After that, it will be nearly impossible to add new privacy functionality because the majority won't want it for the reasons you have outlined.  2-way pegged sidechains will allow a measure of anonymity, but can be blacklisted when converted back to bitcoin. It all depenps on the conventions the government adopts for taint.  Say if &lt;X% of the bitcoin in an address comes a blacklisted source, then it's allowed to be recieved as payment.  It gets messy quickly.
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:06:59

@_date: 2015-02-21 22:53:43
Yeah, he's mostly wrong.  He says that bitcoin will be the Myspace of cryptocurrencies.  While there is a chance of that, he is forgetting that in order for a distributed trustless system like a cryptocurrency to be trusted, it has to be open source.
So if a competitor crypto gains popularity, somebody could always do a git pull and reverse engineer the new functionality into bitcoin.
Also, he seems completely unaware of the sidechain effort, which if implemented will allow 2-way pegged, crypto-currencies of ANY flavor that are "backed" by bitcoin at 100% reserve.  This means you could have the attributes of any coin and the value of bitcoin on the same network.  Why would you ever want to be on a separate chain?

You are confusing terms here.  The term "early adopter" while relative (as one adopter can be earlier than another) does have a specific meaning in academia.  Check out [The Product Diffusion Curve](  
Early adopters are the first 15% of the population to start using something. Bitcoin has nowhere near that penetration yet, so anyone using bitcoin now is an "early adopter".  When you buy bitcoin on a market, it doesn't matter if the person you buy it from started using it Yesterday or 3 years ago.  If you are among the last to buy bitcoin, you will never be an early adopter.
I think you are trying to say something different, but have worded it in a manner that makes people think it's less than bright.

@_date: 2015-02-01 18:34:31
While what you say is likely true, for the time being bitcoin is still very fungible.  The closest things I've seen to breaking fungibility are the taint measure on blockchain.info and colored coins, though the latter don't change the value of the underlying bitcoin, it just adds the token value for something else.
That being said, there are powerful actors in the space, like coInvalidation, that are working actively to make the future you paint a reality.  Coinbase getting so much funding from bank entities scares me as they are likely to push a fractional-reserve model, which defeats the trustlessness and limited supply of Bitcoin.  I don't see a solution to a white-list without a hard fork, even then it's murky.

The last time we had a purely deflationary currency (gold), society was feudalistic.  This is not a coincidence.
Don't worry about me... in such a scenario, I'll be fine. :)  But from a collectivist standpoint, I'd rather not see the majority of humanity fall into sharecropping and serfdom, with no hope of ever saving anything because living expenses (rents) are more than they can ever save.
I actually do have an alternative.  If we were to create a 2-way dynamically pegged sidechain that is inflationary at a programmatically limited but unpredictible rate, but always 100% reserve in bitcoin, then we could retain the incentive to lend for a potential profit while at the same time base our society on sound money.  This is something that gold could never do, become a cryptographically verifiable reserve currency.

Satoshi asked Gavin if he could add him as as one of the project leads.  He said yes, so Satoshi added Gavin and removed himself.  Gavin was sole maintainer of the Core (back then Bitcoin-QT) GitHub repository​ and was the only one who could merge code in the official release.  He was handed the project by Satoshi almost in it's entirety.  Several others got keys to the alert system which Core has since dismantled (including Theymos &amp; Karpeles).
In 2013, Gavin elected to take the role of Cheif Scientist to research on blocksize and invertible bloom filters, and handed over the role of maintainer of the GitHub repo (ability to merge into releases) to Wladimir van del Laan who still holds it today, adding Marco Falke and Jonas Schnelli.

It's a race condition.  The only thing all of that hashing power solves is which random nonce will SHA-256 all of the bitcoin transactions in that block so that the resulting hash vaule is below a threshold (i.e. has a certain nnumber of leading zeros) based on the difficulty.
All of the hashing power is used to ensure the winner is probabilistically random, and can't be applied to any other purpose, with the possible exception of providing heat.

Bitcoin is pseudynonamous.  Primarily, four pieces of information are published to the blockchain for each transaction: sending address, receiving address, sending IP and amount.  
Your address is a pseudonym for you, you can create an nigh-infinite number of them so re-use is discouraged.  It does not tell who you are, but if it can be tied to you (like if you registered on an exchange) an observer of the blockchain has the ability to trace your transactions.  The more addresses the observer has identified, the more easily they can trace every transaction through network effect.
If you spawn a new address and sent to it, an observer has no idea if you sent it to yourself or someone else until the address is spent from.  However the record is permanent.  So, if at any point in time they identify the owner of that address, they can fill in the missing pieces the chain.

By 'they' I'm assuming you are meaning that the majority of the miners adopted a hard fork that extends the subsidy beyond the emission schedule.
If that were the case, I would propose another hard fork that leaves the limit intact and changes the PoW algorithm to something that makes the miner's ASICs useless.  Then the community at large decides which Bitcoin they prefer.
@_date: 2015-02-15 00:34:07

Very interesting.  Peter Todd is correct, it's not switching but adding another valid PoW algorithm.  Sipa is again correct that it would never work because miners would never upgrade to the new soft fork code.
If we could have another Algo that is ASIC resistant, we could keep the anti-botnet security of an ASIC driven network, while simultaneously decentralizing mining.  Best of both worlds.

Sorry, but this is one of the dumbest things is have ever heard.


This statement is correct.  There is no relationship between the hash power and transaction throughout, with the exception that that hashrate is above a minimum threshold required to keep the network secure from attack.


This is where you go off the rails.  This is extrapolation of a cherry picked set.  If you look over history you will see an opposite correlation is generally present; as tx count goes up hashrate **tends** to rise.  Also, you are mistaking correlation for causation here.  As stated above, there is no relationship between hashrate and transaction throughout, so there is no causation, only loose correlation, so the trend should not be extrapolated.


This is just batshit crazy.  Bitcoin miners only consume energy, never produce it.  A miner can no more produce energy than a space heater can.  The lower bound of energy consumption would be if the system failed and everyone turned their miners off, which would be 0... There's no such thing as an energy producing negative hashrate.

Satoshi named it a wallet for a very specific reason.  Like a wallet, anyone with access to it has access to your money, this is key in differentiating it from an "account" which is basically what hosted wallets are.  (Why would you hand over your wallet to somebody for safekeeping?)
To understand why wallet is a better name than keychain, you have to accept that most people will never really know or understand how bitcoin works.  In the original implementation of bitcoin-qt/core, the user didn't even have the ability to see their amounts in addresses without using the command line; all that was presented was the wallet total.  The goal is abstracting and dumbing down bitcoin to the point people don't have to understand how any of it works to be able to use it effectively.
At the end of the day, what do you use a wallet for?  To hold money.

Only a smallish number of BU nodes crashed, likely because they weren't configured with enough RAM to process 32 MB blocks, that's not the fault of the client which ran fine.


That doesn't matter at all. Blocks found that quickly are almost always empty due to headless mining anyway.


Bitcoin uses compact blocks, which was written by Matt Corallo, not Gregg Maxwell.  Graphene operate at 10x efficiency scaling linearly


This is completely false.  Canonical Transaction Ordering doesn't control or limit which transactions a miner can choose to put in the block, it only specifies the order included transactions appear in a block, which is tx ID which is indexed and very fast. This would be an issue for RBF and CPFP, but BCH doesn't have those so it doesn't matter.


Graphene works fine with any transactions a miner wants to include if he broadcasts them prior to finding a block, and even if they don't broadcast ahead of time as long as they are a small percentage of the block.  They are encouraged to broadcast then because it speed propogated of their blocks an protects against being orphaned.


Wait 10 years.


Nodes don't have to be run on a Raspberry Pi to be decentralized.  In 20 years resource requirements for Visa level will be laughable and likely available on a future version of a Raspberry Pi.


If you can't close your lightning network channel because fees to do so and open another one cost more than you have locked up in the channel, how is that nimble?

Largely agree... Wormhole is a one way peg... Basically Omni.


Agree here as well, I always thought segregated witness should have been implemented as a hard fork.  BCH is prioritizing on-chain and BTC is prioritizing off chain, as I said we need both.


Define absurd.  32 MB blocksizes work well on-chain right now.  Have you read up on Graphene with CTOR?  It basically makes propagation of extremely large blocks a non issue.  An 8MB block can be propogated in **a single packet**.  At 32MB a 1 TB drive will hold ~3.5 years worth of txs and it's only getting cheaper.

This is true.


This is true, but also true of SegWit2x, which more hashrate is already in favor of.


Explain your reasoning for this, please.  If the code has over 80% of the hashrate, it will activate SegWit immediately on July 21st.  UASF will still coinsplit because of the BIP9 flags, but nobody will support it once SegWit is active.  This is not to say that it guarantees the 2MB base blocksize increase, but if that has 80% of the hashrate 3 months later, it activates too.


That's exactly what SegWit2x does.

Because SegWit2x is that way.  If 80% of hashrate is achieved it's activated immediately.  This can happen a week before UASF.  I'm not saying it 100% **will** get 80% hashrate, but of it does it will 100% immediately activate SegWit.


Regardless of the hardfork, SegWit activates as soft fork 3 months prior.

Cash is payment and settlement in one..... Bitcoin has a slight delay of settlement due to the need for 6 confimations, but it's the same tx.

SPV clients are a thing.  Not everyone needs to run a full node to transact in bitcoin (they don't on LN either).  We need to scale both on-chain and off.  1 MB will be laughably small in 15 years.  
Without any possibility on-chain competition,  LN hubs become a centralizing force (bigger hubs have more connections and can charge more of a percentage of a short route).  Your LN channel becomes a bank account and we are back to the current banking system, regulation and all.

The market capitalization (total value of all) of Bitcoin is only a little over a billion dollars currently.  To "control" the price of Bitcoin by buying and selling would be trivially easy for any entity with a trillion + dollar budget, and could actually be effectively done by entities with far less money.
Although, in order to do any price fixing, the US government (or any entity) would first have to take a MASSIVE position in the Bitcoin market, which would only drive prices up.

It wasn't mere speculation... It was speculation on margin.  If everybody lost what they had to speculate, it would have been pretty bad but over in a few years.  However, they had massively leveraged positions... Which is what made the great depression so terrible.  Bitcoin is a 100% reserve commodity and less likely to cause anything like the great depression.

The biggest problem with his argument is that the bitcoin supply is currently inflating faster than the USD and has been for all of its existence.  The price increases are despite the additional supply.  A few more halvings and it will be closer to the deflationary currency he thinking of, but by then there will be much more liquidity.

The price of bitcoin has absolutely nothing to do with mining profitability.  
Since mining equipment produces bitcoin, you have to calculate your ROI in bitcoin.  If you look at the cost of a miner at the current exchange rate in bitcoin, and extrapolate the exponential difficulty (plus preorder delay risk) the odds of you making back as much bitcoin as you put in are very low.  More likely you will lose bitcoin.

I think escrow services should charge a fee at deposit, to pay for their impartiality. However, one of the major benefits of bitcoin is low service fees/ overhead. In keeping with this, 2% seems really high... Like what a bank would charge. I'd suggest a price point closer .5% and thats on the high side. If he doesn't fuck this up it could end up big.

Sorry dude.  I fucked that up.  Want to make sure I say it right so you understand.
For previously issued bonds, the price for which the bond can be bought on the open market is inverse to the yield of bonds being currently issued.  So if I buy a bond at 2% and the current yeild is now 3%, my bond is worth less on the open market.
This is important because most bonds are around for 10-30 years, so the secondary market is where most trades occur.

Buying bitcoin isn't an investment at all, it's speculation.  Bitcoin is a very unique type of speculation in that the outcome is fairly binary: it will either be worth close to zero or many, many times its current value in a relatively short time; a decade or so.
Given this type of opportunity, the only logical position to take is one where you consider all monies put in to bitcoin completely lost for a minimum period of time, or minimum valuation.  You can only afford to do this with money you do not need.
@_date: 2013-07-29 22:36:36
The problem is not that it doesn't work currently.  The problem is that it only works because of a loophole in Apple's TOS.  Apple has a great financial incentive to prohibit Bitcoin as it is more profitable for purchases to go through the app store.  The problem is not with the technology, but Apple's (admittedly currently ineffective) censorship of Bitcoin on its devices.  And since Apple has taken this stance, there is a strong likelihood in the future they will change the TOS just enough to ban blockchain.info too.  If you really want support Bitcoin as a currency, you should boycott Apple until they allow native wallet apps on the iPhone.

The reason Apple is trying to keep you from using Bitcoin is because it wants to maintain the App Store's monopoly on payments (Apple gets an obscene cut of every transaction).
The reason why the blockchain.info app is approved is because it found a loophole by keeping the wallet entirely on the web and only using the app to send commands to the web.  It's actually an ingenious workaround on their part, but if Apple changes thier TOS, the app will dissapear.

The fed introduces money into the supply by buying previously issued US Treasury bonds.  This increases demand for the treasuries and artificially lifts prices in the bond market.  The "new money" goes to the sellers of the bonds as a profit premium over what they bought them for.  Goldman Sachs does this all day long.

Very good, but an important point is that the value of the blockchain reward isn't the only thing the miners get.  They also get that small mining fee from each transaction.  As transaction volumes increase and the reward decreases, the fees will dwarf the reward and still make mining a worthwhile endeavor.   If the Bitcoin network goes mainstream there will be plenty of transactions to keep the fees low.

I agree the amount of gold is finite, but it is MUCH larger than you think.  To date, pretty much all gold mined is stuff that's made it's way to the earth's crust naturally.  There is most likely many, many times that amount swirling around in the liquid magma that makes up most of our planet.  If technology ever progresses to a level that allows us to access even a small percentage of it, it will dwarf the amount mined to date.
If we were to discover a practically infinite source of energy like fusion, we could create gold out of other atoms.

No, the demand for money has been relatively consistent.  The increased supply is going to the top 1%, who just sit on it.  Thus it never enters into the larger economy.  The increase in supply of money is really just shifting it from the poor to the wealthy at this point.

If you buy a bitcoin at $200, and the price goes up to $300, you do not have $300, you have one bitcoin.  The price only matters at the time you spend or sell your bitcoin.
In response to your original question, the volatility will decrease to the level of a major currency logarithmically as bitcoin approaches the liquidity of a major currency.  Basically, the higher the price goes the more stable it will become.

I would love to be able to put 2-3% of my Roth into BIT.

If you were able to do so at the beginning of this year, the small percentage would now outweigh the rest of your portfolio by a fair margin with no taxes due at retirement.

To the laymen:
"It's complicated, but they run a computer program that takes all of the bitcoin transactions for that block and a 'nonce' (different number every time) and spits out a resulting very large number that can't be pre-determined (without running the whole process).  If that number is less than the very very low target number of the lottery, that computer wins.  If more 'tickets' are bought, the number gets lower and it gets harder to win the lottery."

There definitely are fundamentals to Bitcoin. In fiat the fundamentals are driven by Central Bank policy, levels of debt and defecit and a nation's foreign policy. In Bitcoin the fundamentals are driven by the miner's consensus decisions (hard forks), global laws and regulatons still being written (ex. FinCEN guidance), acceptance/adoption by business and the population and frequency of use by consumers.
