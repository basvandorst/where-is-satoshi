Dude he invested at 4k, he's been in the game for MONTHS.  He knows what he's talking about

Ethereum has been doing more daily transactions than bitcoin has for a while now.  It still takes only minutes to transact for pennies. Iota and Raiblocks technically can handle way more, but haven't had the load yet.  There are many more that currently handle scaling better than bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:45:21
So true my man.  Rasperry pi's &gt; $100 tx fees.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:41:47
Use one of the hundreds of other cryptos cause bitcoin is pretty useless for transacting now.  Eth, Neo, Ltc, Iota, vtc, etc.  All of those  only take minutes and cost pennies or nothing to transact.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:40:01
Oh my bad.  I was indeed misinformed by my ledger nano s when it cost $25 to send some bitcoin to coinbase.  Being purely a store of value is indeed supreme.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:28:24
What did the firm charge you though?  I've never payed someone to do my taxes before but it's looking real complicated with crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:40:06
Only people from the_donald
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:36:58
So you guys are chill with $30 average tx fees?  Cause it's fucking bullshit to me.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:49:18
How about instead of crying about bitcoin cash, bitcoin works to become better than it so there is no discussion?  
Just increase that block size and boom, bitcoin cash has nothing better to offer and it gives time for further development.  
We need to keep the hype going, not raspberry pi's.  Bitcoins market share dropped below 50% again today.  
Bitcoin mining is already crazy centralized so don't give me that excuse and I definitely don't want to hear about this godly lightning network that's coming as soon as the second coming of Christ and will supposedly solve everything, make all alts obsolete, and give meaning to your life.
*edit - I also read that for the lightning network to be functional/practical it needs bigger blocks anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:15:40
Yeah it failed because raspberry pis &gt; $100 tx fees.  And apparently if you increase the block size to 2mb it will lead to an unstoppable addiction of increasing the block size till it's over 1000 terabytes.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:20:39
Cool username.  Go back to the_donald where you belong.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:52:42
My bad for wanting to send my bitcoin to a wallet I control. It's funny how this sub has progressed to thinking it's okay that it's not worth sending anywhere.  One of it's only two functions, the other being receiving.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:38:11
There are hundreds of other cryptos to use besides bitcoin and bitcoin cash.  This sub is so focused on trying to take down bitcoin cash that it will be in pure shock when another crypto that actually focuses on tech and is useful surpasses it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:43:19
I love how the white male baby boomer immediately interrupted him to say "we've done pretty good so far on this system".  Yeah, you boomers have made out great on the current centralized system that is screwing everyone else over.  Now the people who are getting fucked want something different.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:12:15
You KNOW LN will make all other crypto's obsolete?  You obviously no nothing about other crypto's then.  Most of them are not trying to be a currency and none of them are trying to be just a store of value which is what bitcoin has become.  Blockchain technology has other use cases than being a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:05:47
Did you not read my post?  Ethereum already does MORE daily transactions than bitcoin and has been since July.  Look at this chart 
Yesterday, ethereum did 1.1 million transactions while bitcoin did only 380 thousand. 
LN at this point sounds like people waiting for the second coming of christ.  This sub believes LN will solve all of bitcoins issues instantly and will make other cryptos obsolete.  From what I've read, LN actually requires over 100mb block sizes to work at a reasonable scale and that will require a hard fork plus all users switching over to segwit all of which will take years based on bitcoins record of implementing change.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:10:21
Yeah obviously 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:14:29
Bitcoin cash's value has increased about 1000% since it's release in August.  Yeah, it's doing pretty bad...
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:00:28
Ethereum has a different structure than bitcoin.  It doesn't have a block size but a "gas limit".  The gas limit is a cap on both processing power and storage/bandwidth.  Anyways Eth is moving to PoS in 2018 and it will be totally different then.

What did this quote mean? "I expect to hear of the first Bitcoin unicorn (Coinbase maybe)." What's a unicorn?

eh ehmm... Washington State

When are you coming to Washington state?? Pls respond

I'm pretty sure GBTC is completely seperate from COIN
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:07:21
So just in case the ETF gets approved, how do I make sure I'm able to hop on it asap?  I have 5.5k sitting in my vanguard Roth IRA waiting to buy.
Edit: Okay I wasn't very clear in my question.  I'm really wondering if anyone knows if Vanguard will have the COIN ETF as soon as it's available?  I have a naive feeling they may be slow to have it up for purchase on their site.
Edit   Also where the hell is the bitcoin roller coaster meme?  I don't see it anywhere on the front page?!

I'm sure plenty more people would use Gemini if they serviced more places, I still can't use Gemini from WA state.

Cool dude. You write like someone from r/iamverysmart. I've been working as an embedded software engineer for the past 6 years but yeah I'm not too well versed in cryptography. I do however know when someone is trying to use jargon to sound smart and confuse others but in reality aren't actually saying anything of substance
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:10:37
That first paragraph tries to use so many words to scare people into thinking SegWit2x is malicious:  
 "it is a contentious deviation from the existing network rules" translates to "it's an update that isn't backwards compatible."
"its users will soon find themselves disagreeing with the rest of the network about the validity of blocks and transactions" translates to "you need to update when the release comes out".  Like when an update for an online game comes out and you need to download it to play with them.
"a proposal for an incompatible change to the consensus rules" this again translates to "not backwards compatible"

What is a normal rate a CPA would charge an individual client?  I've only ever used turbo tax before, but this is the first time in my life I have significant capital gains.  Do CPA's typically charge a flat rate?  Or is it based off of a percentage of the tax filing?  Losing 40% to taxes already hurts enough.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:06:27
I'm in the same boat of thinking I won't be able to determine my gains because I used to use shapeshift a lot and they keep no records.  I only converted crypto to USD in January of this year.  Do you think I would be safe to not pay taxes on my crypto to crypto 2017 trades since the like-kind rule for 2017 is so unclear?
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:29:34
You're really posting this misleading chart that where the y-axis only goes to 10%?  Props on making the print small so most people won't notice either.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:14:21
Okay bud, it's been about two months and it's at 10%.  Likely going to take ~2 years for full adoption which would make Garzik's statement correct, which is what this post is making fun of...
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:32:55
Holy shit you are such a whiny envious shell of a person.  You have a million dollars, whatever hole your in is self made and delusional.  You could put that million dollars into the S&amp;P 500 and live the rest of your life on a beach in central america.  Stop being so greedy and learn to appreciate what you have and stop comparing yourself to other rich assholes.  Damn.  People like you suck.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:01:41
They said the 8th not the 28th.  Two other people copied your mistake as well.

Just look at the other comments in this thread.  So much block size increase hate. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:43:36
Lets say I have 100 bitcoin bought at various times over several years and I decide I want to sell 10 bitcoin today.  How would I calculate my gains?  Would it be on the price I bought my first 10 bitcoin years ago?  Or would it be on the price I bought my last 10 bitcoin a week ago?  Or do I just choose?
