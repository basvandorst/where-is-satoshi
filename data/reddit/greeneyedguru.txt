That's all well and good, but if you want to push that point of view into Bitcoin you should tell people to stop touting 'microtransactions' as a use case as that use case will rapidly evaporate if this is the way the project is going.
You should also put up a large banner on bitcoin.org giving a nice fat middle finger to the 'unbanked' that Bitcoin is supposed to help.

But Satoshi could have just as easily created the total supply in the first block, or as a constant in the code itself.  The subsidy is there to ensure that people mine so that transactions get confirmed and the network stays secure.

Very true, but for the purposes of this discussion, I'm not interested in comparing currencies, but rather to compare transaction processing systems.
@_date: 2015-06-06 00:00:23
I'm not convinced.  The entire point of the Bitcoin network is to process transactions (what use would anyone have for a currency that's not transactable?).  Any cost associated with maintaining the network is at least in part (I would say major part) going toward transaction processing.
You are correct that blocks don't have to have any transactions at all, (other than the coinbase transaction) however that is not the intent of the system, and miners understand how this relates to the survival of the currency, otherwise they'd just be generating empty blocks all the time.
@_date: 2015-06-06 00:09:50

It's meaningful when you are trying to compare two systems.  Bitcoin vs. Ripple, for example, or Bitcoin vs. Visa.
@_date: 2015-06-18 01:23:00
I would be impressed if this happened in 5 years considering Bitcoin currently only has 0.006% of Visa's transactional capacity, (3 tps vs. 50,000 tps) and even if blocks were 20MB it would still only have 0.12% of Visa's transactional capacity.  And it's proving to be difficult to get the consensus necessary to even increase it to that.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:18:14
It IS the cost of transactions, that's why it's called a subsidy in the source code (look it up if you don't believe me).  What is being subsidized if not the cost of processing transactions via mining?

It's planned debasement, but debasement nonetheless.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:58:05


Bad analogy.  Obviously the intent of the block subsidy is at least partially to subsidize the confirmation of transactions, since that's the overall purpose of the network.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:35:01


that's incorrect.
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:35:17
Try thinking for yourself.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:37:09
I don't have a problem with the subsidy, but you can't argue that it's going to miners and miners are responsible for confirming transactions.
The point is not to argue against the subsidy, it is necessary.  The point is to get people thinking about what the real cost of maintaining the network is, especially the cost per transaction and how it compares with other payment providers.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:12:08
In the coinbase transaction for every block.  Here's the latest:  
If you own Bitcoin, the value of your coins was debased by ~0.000176% by that transaction.
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:44:52
There's no solution that disallows the 1MB coin to live.  People can always run the old version of the software if they want to and nobody can stop them.
@_date: 2015-06-02 01:41:28
How exactly will Bitcoin gain widespread adoption if the average user will have to wait half a week for a transaction to confirm?  Some people already think 10 minutes is too long.
How is raising the limit (which miners are free to lower) a rash change if it's being slowly phased in over a year?
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:48:09


Specifically, more.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:32:44
The new coins created by the coinbase transaction are a subsidy for miners.  They're even referred to as such in the source code.
The network as a whole pays this subsidy via debasement of the currency.  The point is not whether or not this should be done -- obviously, it is necessary -- it's to get people to consider the actual cost of each transaction rather than the nominal cost (the tx fee, which can be as low as free) and how that compares with other payment processors.
@_date: 2015-06-18 06:32:22
Nope, not buying it.  Forcing most of the transactions off-chain does not keep Bitcoin decentralized.
Who cares how big blocks get?  The average user does not need to store the entire blockchain and with block pruning a reality in the next release, won't have to.
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:40:27

I don't think you're reading the chart correctly.  It's not a chart of block subsidy vs. transaction fee.
The chart is showing how much miners can expect to earn from a block *from transaction fees alone*.
I.E. if miners expect to earn 6.25 BTC per (full) block in transaction fees, the chart shows how high fees need to be in order for that to happen at the given block size.
Products that depend on network effect to succeed need to increase their userbase, not constrain or reduce it, and especially not do that artificially.
TX size with two inputs and two outputs is about 700 bytes and the average will increase over time as more transactions are added to the ledger.
@_date: 2015-06-05 22:36:33
Ripple is extremely successful.  It's hardly something I would use as an example of why Bitcoin had to be a certain way.
@_date: 2015-06-19 22:46:46
Lightning network is just a settlement network that uses Bitcoin for clearing payments.  It is nothing new, nothing spectactular.  It does nothing for p2p payments, unless those payments are happening off-chain via some third party payment provider, and in those cases, it just facilitates ability to send to people using different providers.

Going back to that coffee meme, the implied message is that 1MB is fine unless for everything else.  You know substantial stuff like paying your mortgage, business deals, major capital expenditures, or paying a supplier for inventory.  This just isn't the case though.  Do you know anyone who pays for coffee with a bank wire? The FedWire service (run by US federal reserve) processes ~150 million bank wires annually.   The FedWire service only operates in the US.  Internationally the largest clearinghouse is SWIFT and it processes more than 5 billion transfers annually.  The US ACH network is even larger with 19 billion transactions annually (excluding converted checks).  There are also about 2 billion international remittances annually (western union, moneygram, and other networks).  A 1MB restricted Bitcoin network couldn't even keep up with these transfer networks even if you forget about retail sales completely.  The idea keeping the 1MB restriction, only keeps limits the utility of small payments is simply incorrect.

It cost them nothing to premine 12 million coins in the first block.
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:53:53
Well, it depends on what they are calling unregistered securities.
I believe the non-criminal penalties for selling unregistered securities are a fine + recission.  (i.e., they'll have to buy back the unregistered securities at whatever price they sold them.)  This alone would most likely bankrupt them.
(Also, they're most likely talking about Hashlets, here, not Paycoin.  Paycoin could potentially fall under the 'unregistered securities' classification as well, but could also be considered a convertible currency rather than a security, which has far more interesting implications if it can be proven they were manipulating the market.)

The point is whether they will be used because they're the best solution, or whether users will be forced into using them because of high transaction fees (hint -- they wont -- nobody who knows any better is going to pay more than a Litecoin or insert-your-alt-currency-here transaction fee to use Bitcoin).

Negative balances are pretty much a fact of life with altcoins since many of them fork frequently.  Should Cryptsy just have to eat the coins that were lost in a fork?  It's reasonable that they deduct coins that were lost in forks from your account, even if that causes your balance to be negative.

Conversely, Bitcoin provides nothing, design-wise, over most of the altcoins.
In fact, some of the altcoins have superior design elements.
Right now, what bitcoin's got going for it is vendor acceptance (maybe most importantly, Silk Road acceptance), and easy fiat conversion .  If an altcoin was to catch up in those areas, there'd be no reason it couldn't catch or overtake bitcoin.
I do agree with you to an extent that most of the altcoins are not "going anywhere", but right now it's more profitable on GPU to mine many of them (especially LTC) and convert to BTC than mining BTC directly.  Or more to the point, it's *still* profitable to mine them in many areas where BTC mining has ceased to be energy-efficient.

If TRC ever gets big I'll have around 2000 by then, otherwise I'll try to trade them for bitcoin before they go out of existence.  Might do the same with PPC as well although the difficulty is a bit higher.
Does Litecoin have any merchants accepting it?  In the end I think this is what's going to decide things more than anything else.

Well, people are currently willing to trade BTC for all three, so they're worth something -- I don't know why this is the case -- maybe diversification, maybe speculation, but GPU mining LTC (for example) is currently more profitable than mining BTC and has been for months.  PPC is actually even more profitable than LTC at the moment, but it is hard to find any information on it.
