May be true in Europe, but a high percentage of American millionaires are self made and did NOT inherit their fortunes

No one ever got hurt by taking a profit!!!! Take some off the table when you are up big, and play with the house's money. If you're feeling risky, reinvest on attractive dips!

Thanks for the write up. Not intending to start a flame war here, so I appreciate the honest responses. 
To play devil's advocate -- if the floor cost of mining is assumed to be the cost of hardware + electricity, should the price of Bitcoin not fall to the sum of fixed cost (hardware to mine) and variable cost (electrcitiy consumption)? I'm a bit rusty on my econ, but I believe that's typically the direction that markets move over the long term

I disagree with poster's usage of the Buffett quote, but I dont see any issue with making weekly deposits from paycheck amounting to 5% of his investment portfolio. That's how millions of Americans (including myself) contribute to their retirement accounts, and also how I grew my investment portfolio from zero to six figures in a few years.

Thanks for the thoughtful post. I understood what you were saying; more taking issue with the usage of "hence" here. In my (and many others') investing career, there have been plenty of occasions when a short position was held for a longer period of time than a long position :)

This is totally normally behavior IMO. Asset classes don't just go straight up  forever. Think there just hasn't been any major developments recently to warrant a move in the price

Sorry that life isn't going how you'd like it to be going. Indeed, if your view is that destiny has cast you into a life of mediocrity from which you can never escape, such will be your fate.

While I'm sure it took a good amount of effort, this analysis is hardly useful without documentation of the assumptions used. Monte Carlo is more useful for statistical analysis where you can reasonably assume that certain things are at least somewhat correlated with others. My personal opinion is that the huge run up in Bitcoin last year was driven in large part by hype, which is something that would be incredibly difficult to accurately forecast in a Monte Carlo simulation.

A little bit insulting that the maker of this post thinks everyone else is just as ignorant about basic finance. Do you really think banks make loans without fully knowing how they get paid back? That is literally their core business. Like saying best buy doesn't know how it's going to make money by selling you a TV.

IMO those who are freaking out about price have done a poor job with asset allocation/diversification. In other words, taking on way more risk than is appropriate for your portfolio and time horizon

If you had an investment portfolio of a million dollars in ANY asset class, your portfolio would swing by thousands of dollars on a daily basis
Edit for math: I'm a few drinks in. Weekly basis is probably more accurate

I can tell you studied economics

It does apply to trading (Google "behavioral finance" for additional context). This is common in stock markets as well.

Good Lord pls don't buy Bitcoin on your credit card. The amount of interest you have to overcome in capital gains makes it so expensive just to break even. There's a reason they put that restriction in place -- it's to protect you.

Thanks for your reply and that is a good point! For his sake, I hope you are correct about OP's intent.

Came here to comment on the ignorance of your post, but I see that Reddit is already roasting you. How long are you planning to leave this up? Lol.

Please stop applying Buffetisms to crypto. It's so dangerous for those who don't know any better. The man himself doesn't believe in crypto.
