My understanding is that a hard fork would only occur if the client doesn't know what to do with the new data. If the rules for all future size changes, up or down, are known by clients already, they can verify larger blocks without a hard fork.

I would suggest getting rid of the bubbly style, its not 2007 anymore. Flatter subtle styles are whats in these days. Checkout bootstrap and various themes for it for easy mode designing that is decent.
EDIT: Also, dont use images for blocks of content. The large sections on the home page that all link to register should all be html + css styled content, and should do what a user would expect clicking on it would do (IE show the user an auction page). Registration should be offered as a link to register and/or required when a user attempts to bid. That way users can still use the site until the point where registration is absolutely necessary. This will help keep first time users around long enough to see if they actually want to make a purchase, rather than leaving immediately and never coming back if they don't feel like registering.
EDIT 2: Also don't copy ebay's original design, they moved on for a reason.

You aren't supposed to use them because you changed your mind, they are for when you don't get what you paid for AND you have already tried to work with the company for a refund. Some assholes obviously get through the cracks. If they refuse to give you your money back you can ask your bank to do a chargeback. The business is then responsible to prove that you did get your item, or they're out your money + like a $36 fee. A business with too many chargebacks will not be allowed to process credit card transactions anymore. I assume if you request too many chargebacks (and lose the disputes) banks will refuse to do business with you as well, if not press charges for fraud.
So don't get too many ideas that you can just do this and always get your money back;)

So the merkle root is the top level hash, correct? Are the transactions in an array in the same order the miner created them in? Does the miner get to choose what order they're in? Would it be possible to generate several different acceptable merkle trees with transactions and test a nonce against multiple strings and increase your chances of finding a block faster?
Sorry for the block of questions haha

@_date: 2015-05-08 22:19:34
That makes sense, thanks! A nonce of 19 got me 2 zeros, is that acceptable since it has at least 1 or does it have to be exactly one?
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:46:19
So say there are these 10 transactions I want because they have decent fees. Do i decide on that before attempting to solve for the block, or do I solve for a block and then I have the power to say these 10 transactions go in it?
EDIT: edit answers these questions
EDIT 2: Ok so a block is taking all the TXIDs of the transactions you want and hashing them together? How does the difficulty come into play. Also, if i just take all the TXIDs and hash them, isn't there only 1 possible hash for that? Why does it take trillions of attempts?
@_date: 2017-02-22 21:52:55
How does it even work though? Do you just sell the tide to a shady little store that wants to offer it to their customers but doesn't want to pay full wholesale price for it?
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:24:05
So the merkle tree is basically the TXID of several transactions hashed in pairs until you have a single top level hash. How does someone verifying this block make sure that they create the merkle tree in the same order to produce the same proof of work to verify the block is legit?
@_date: 2015-05-10 21:06:22
Oh I'm sure there is a solution, I'm just wondering what exactly that is. I know when I add a key to my wallet it takes like 20 minutes to rescan and find all past transactions for that address, so I'm sure my client isn't receiving a new transaction and scrolling back through everything to see if it's been included in a past block.
Now maybe it doesn't have to do that. Since the output attempting to be spent is linked to the original TX its from, you would only have to scan blocks since that point maybe? But if it was an output created in one of the first blocks, today that could take awhile to process. There's probably a better algorithm of figuring it out but can't think of what that might be..
@_date: 2015-05-10 20:45:31
What if it was spent like 20 blocks ago? Surely Bitcoin doesn't rescan the whole chain for each transaction. Maybe getting into details that are too technical here, just curious haha.

I think the question is what is BTC with a G on it?
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:52:29
The only ways I could think of would be to somehow track the IPs that relayed the transactions, if that company only used addresses with a prefix (1Circle....) or if the company purposely embedded any data within a script in the transaction about who they were (wouldn't be smart on their part). Other than that, not really.

@_date: 2017-08-25 15:50:03
True, but maybe that's a good thing. Baring the other issue that was mentioned in another comment, mining systems could be paused until there are enough transactions to process. Less power usage. Another problem would be that not every node receives every TX right away so some miners would have advantage.

There are thousands of forum posts on the internet forever that says this app offers Bitcoin services and is one of the best apps offering those services. New users that read these posts and then download the app to use it for Bitcoin deserve to know it doesn't do that anymore. No one has any obligation to leave a review that doesn't mention that fact just because the company pivoted and everyone should respect their decision.

Well no actually they were not an exchange, they bought and sold bitcoin for fiat (This is just my understanding of them, I have never used Circle). Look at Coinbase, they have one service that is buying and selling bitcoin with them directly and they have their exchange service which is user to user exchanging. I know its the same thing to you but the entity taking on the risk of making or losing money is completely different.
That said I do agree its bullshit they pulled out of the bitcoin market, it was my understanding that was all they did so pivoting out completely is a big fuck you to the users.

Yes and no. Every transaction sends the full amount of whatever outputs it needs to meet the amount you're sending. If theres extra left over that amount comes back to you to a change address. Bitcoin Core Wallet manages this for you behind the scenes. That said, your other address may still have unspent outputs that it can still send from.

Nothing else you need to do unless you care about which addresses show up on the blockchain. You can go in advanced mode and choose the specific unspent outputs you want to use for a transaction. That said, if all your coins reside on one address currently, that wont help you.

They can't. The software can be tweaked as needed to get by any potential blocks, barring complete internet shutdown. They could only police people using it as well as they can cash transactions, which is pretty much impossible. You won't have mainstream businesses supporting it but probably 90% of the places that accept it now could still operate completely under the radar.
It's too much of a waste of time and money to police, so they wont.

I don't think its that simple. For example, as a developer I can pull on average a salary of around 120k. If I have the luxury of time on my side in order to land the right job I can successfully work at that price, if not higher. But if I'm out of time and I have rent due in 2 weeks, I have to start looking for anything available, say around 60k. Covers my bills at least but not much else.
The company offering the job at 60k was only able to fill their position thats listed well below market rate because they found someone that they could take advantage of due to not having the luxury of time. To me this is the exact opposite definition of fair as per the comment I replied to.
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:40:44
I guess I just don't see the point of that. Whos to say you would have been able to mine the segwit block if you don't actually do the math? It doesn't prove anything just to show more transactions in a fake block template if you don't mine it also, anyone could just make their own block templates out of every TX in the node's tx pool for funsies I guess.
@_date: 2016-12-01 23:29:42
The address is generated from the hash of the Public key. Its not actually made public.
@_date: 2016-11-24 09:15:36
I don't think thats really possible. Part of the verification process is first creating a tree of txid hashes from the transactions you'll be including in the block and hashing them all down a specific way to give you one hash where you then try to find a nonce that when hashed together with your hash gives you another hash with the expected difficulty (some number of 0's in a row at the start of the hash). They would essentially have to do all this work twice and at the same time they wish to publish the original block which is basically impossible unless they had the entire networks hash power times 2-3 before difficulty recalculated.

Can someone explain how backdoors in encryption work? I've looked though a few hashing algorithms like sha256 and ripemd180 and found there are functions where data is lost in a way that cannot be recreated. Obviously hashing is meant to be one way so this may not apply the same way to encryption algorithms but I just can't imagine someone could hide a backdoor in these things that wouldn't easily be found by a moderately competent security dev.

Not sure why your specific wallet has more than one, but in general, when you spend bitcoin, say .2 of 1 bitcoin (ignoring some intricacies in this explanation), you actually send the full 1 bitcoin in the transaction. .2 goes to the address you sent it to, the transaction fees goto the miners when they add your transaction to a block, and the remaining .79 odd coins are returned to you. 
Generally the wallet generates a new address for these coins, as once you use an address once its a little more vulnerable (I believe the public key is now accessible in the transaction, though I could be wrong. Your private key is still secure but you are opened up to attack at that address if someone discovers a bug in the way your wallet app generates keys). So now you have multiple addresses that your wallet manages for you.
This wont generally be an issue for most but if you every attempt to export your private keys from one app to another, make sure you actually get the key for the address that has your funds. I wouldn't recommend doing it this way though and rather than transferring private keys around, just send the coins to a new wallet if you're trying to get your coins on a new device or something.
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:24:16

You may not make huge profits that way but you will be more secure in that your purchase price will be an average of the price when you bought it. i.e. if you bought $100 at 4800, 4900, 5000, 5100 and 5200, it would be like you bought $500 at 5000. This makes you more resistant to dips over time.

You're not really selling someone on Bitcoin with that argument. As much as I don't want to screw over a local business, decisions I make are based solely on my own self preservation, so with that argument I would easily take the credit card from the company that 99% of the time backs me even when its my own fault.

It's in quotes, they're aware.

Europe always had better card security than we do in the US, were only just migrating to chip and pin (but its only half assed at this point, you can still swipe and sign). Wouldn't be surprised if you had a password to use your cards online. We don't, just enter name number, exp date and CVV, all info printed on the card, and you're gold. Pretty stupid.

They are using php

That's not how many customers they have, that's how many users they have. Paying customers are the only ones that get support.

But is the NDA void if the contract is not honored? Just because one contract is broken does not necessarily mean the other is. Of course I don't know the details of either contract to tell you one way or another I'm just letting you know that you should probably keep any info about this in private conversations with your lawyer, not openly online and against your NDA which based on what you said above now voids your contract.

Without consistent standard regulations everywhere, including low income areas, someone without a choice but to eat at the cheapest place nearby is forced to put their family at risk to survive. If everywhere that exists has to meet the same standards, they wont have to wonder if where they're eating is safe or not, because if it exists, it meets standards, thus it is.
Government has to have the monopoly because they're the only organization that can force payment via taxes to cover the expenses of verifying regulations are met and enforcing the law when they are not. You can't just have "downloadyoursafetycertificate.com" handing out whatever ratings they want just because someone paid their little fee to have it. Even if the fee covered some checks if they meet their fake regulations, it most definitely wont cover legal expenses to enforce them.

Yes, they wouldn't do anything at this point unless they got to a court room. At best its a possible defense their lawyer could use. Not saying it would work, just saying its an option.

Except how often do you plan to regenerate your wallet seed? Because if someone steals your physical wallet they just get whats in it. If someone steals your Jaxx seed they get all the coins in there now and in the future if you're an everyday user that thinks just generating a new address with your same seed is sufficient.

You people are fucking weird with your anti government shit. Instead of being afraid of the government, why don't we make them work for us, as they're supposed to do? I want them to do everything that makes sense for them to do (anything that is good for everyone, i.e. healthcare, food safety standards, building codes, etc)

Haven't you just broken that NDA with this post? Gonna have a hard time fighting this now...

At a minimum encrypt it on disk with a PIN when you open the app.
@_date: 2019-05-28 09:58:57
Wrong, you'll have a lawless wild west trash heap.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:17:57
Fair, I wish you luck but you could have made a post that didn't mention specifics that could effect your ability to eventually fight the case in court. In the right setting however a decent judge would still take your side.
@_date: 2019-05-28 04:25:29
Things dont work because people like you keep voting to defund and deregulate everything making everything shit. If you people could fuck off for a second we could have a nice world.

Sure, but for a technology that already struggles with user adoption and complexity its not good. I would argue that its irresponsible for anyone developing tech for bitcoin to not take security as the utmost priority. Ease of use is not an excuse here. A simple 4 digit pin would cause no added difficulty and could be used to encrypt the file on disc at a minimum (even this could be cracked trivially but its still something). Especially because the encryption libraries are already loaded into their app. Its 1 line of code to encrypt and decrypt on file load and save.

Online usage password? Where does this exist? You can actually process a card payment online with nothing more than the number and maybe an expiration date, it is only recommended to ask for the CVV in the case a customer claims fraud its at least something the business owner can show they made an extra step in preventing fraud.

Haha it may be a little hacky way around the system but A for Affort, creative at least :P

I just did this by doing a cash deposit at my bank, super convenient having one across the street from work. Thanks!

Hand write your private key on paper and delete your (already encrypted) wallet.dat file for real cold storage.

Why is it my fault that power companies are still using carbon based materials to generate power?
@_date: 2013-09-17 15:31:57
Trying that but my deposit limit seems to be just too low to get the amount I need :/
EDIT: nice idea though
@_date: 2013-09-17 15:30:26
Yes.
