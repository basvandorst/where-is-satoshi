@_date: 2019-07-07 00:57:37

@_date: 2019-07-07 00:12:06
you need to learn how to write a complete sentence first.
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:29:42
he needs to start with 1st grade english.
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:51:01
or maybe we are all just getting played and he’s very fluent in english.
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:36:22
how much did you pay?
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:31:46
nobody actually knows what the price will go too but why not hold and take the risk??
@_date: 2019-07-20 01:02:27
get a burner phone and buy bitcoin through an atm.
@_date: 2019-07-11 02:20:52
i could never claim mine either.
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:11:43
any extra cash i get goes towards bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:28:23
keep us posted
@_date: 2019-08-22 02:03:23
just google it and you will find an atm near you.
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:58:59
bitcoin atms allow you to purchase with cash. no bank needed.
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:40:22
did you figure it out?
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:12:51
the bitcoin meister
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:32:31
yes. look on youtube plenty of videos of how to do it.
@_date: 2019-06-12 03:43:53
very excited!
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:11:37
that would be cool to have part of it paid in btc.
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:32:05
i exchanged bcash and bgold for btc.
@_date: 2019-06-11 01:36:38
if you have the private keys import the wallet using the blockchain app.
@_date: 2019-06-11 00:34:55
if you don’t have access to that wallet your are following then yes you lost it.
@_date: 2019-06-11 02:45:57
you need the private key man. that’s the only way you can import that wallet into the blockchain app. did you print out paper wallets by any chance?
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:02:18
if fb bans you from their platform what happens to your libra coins? i’d rather take my chances with bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:33:53
from your old phone
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:20:15
coinomi is pretty easy to split coins.
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:18:16
keep us posted. curious to see how this plays out for you.
@_date: 2019-06-11 00:44:54
confirmations have nothing to do with it saying non-spendable. you are following that bitcoin wallet within the blockchain app. the only way you can spend it is if you import the private keys to that particular wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:00:09
ah way too far. thanks!
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:52:32
where did you find these?
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:06:16
a lot of web wallets don’t provide the private keys. if you don’t have access to them then you are out of luck.
@_date: 2019-06-11 02:12:18
how did you buy the bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:12:07
add the forked coins to your coinomi wallet then on the top right there’s 3 dots, press it and you should see a sweep wallet option. make sure you move your bitcoin out of that wallet 1st before claiming the forked coins.
