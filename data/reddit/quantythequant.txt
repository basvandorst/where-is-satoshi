I didn’t imply that at all. Traditional equities and derivatives markets have been operating for the better part of a century and are highly structured. 
You can model the US stock market and create a trading algorithm — you can’t do the same (effectively) with the crypto market because a model doesn’t exist. 
It’s all speculation and akin to value investing.

An asset ‘popping’, recovering, and going about the cycle again is still in a bubble. 
Just because a bubble pops and recovers, doesn’t mean it isn’t a bubble. Bitcoin IS in a bubble, which is neither inherently good or bad as the cryptocurrrency gains traction and as the market price adjusts.

Bitcoin doesn’t have a designation; it’s not classified as anything right now, because it’s still ambiguous/agencies have no idea wtf they’re dealing with.
It doesn’t nessecarily have to be a currency when it stabilizes; a lot of people assert bitcoin being a digital gold. Regardless, it’s still a proof of concept and pushing the wave of decentralized technologies forward. If you’re expecting bitcoin to be a viable cash replacement at this point, you don’t really understand the state bitcoin (or cryptos in general) is in right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:47:58

No one said about forever. Not citing this as a source of truth, but a logarithmic price-network size plot gives a solid story as to a healthy price for BTC.
Other factors included, 5K is pretty low, and I think the route there involves a mass panic sell, which is less likely after yesterday’s blood bath. We held 10K pretty well, and the decline is slowing.

@_date: 2018-01-25 16:35:22
This is a good point, but you’re also talking about an organization that manipulated the market to an insane extent with their BCH stunt, and spams the mem pool for no good reason because they refuse the concept of transaction batching.
I doubt segwit is high on their list of priorities. Coinbase can screw themselves. Gemini (or other large American exchanges) are much better and provide better service. 
Also, bit of confirmation bias here, but the number of posts about failed wires to Coinbase far outnumbers those from other reputable exchanges, even considering the relative user bases of each org.

@_date: 2017-12-11 21:03:08
Not sure where that’s coming from — that’s fundamentally flawed thinking. Bull vs bear views don’t matter if you’re hodling large crypto-coins. Short term, these big volatile spikes ensure there’re good and bad times to get in; you can gauge this by gathering information on market sentiment, network size, among other things. 
If we’re at a point where everyone is dumping their money into BTC, the CBOE has just offered publicly traded futures, with the CME offering around the corner, it’s a fucking objectively bad time to buy into FOMO.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:32:38
The monster started to eat his arm, so he cut it off. He liquidated his position.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:42:20
Don’t buy at this point. It’s all FOMO atm; wait for a large correction.
Edit: should clarify not to buy NOW. Not sure why I’m getting downvoted when BTC has had a ridiculously rally this past weekend, has opened futures on a public exchange, and is awaiting CME next week...? Make rational decisions, and remember that FOMO stands for “fear off missing out”.
Having to ask if you should panic buy is a very good indicator **not to buy.**

There’s a lot more to it. An underlying factor is the size of the network, and there’re more. Speculation drives volatility and growth, to a certain extent — neglecting other factors is shortsighted.
Understanding the basics of vanilla finance, blockchain, and networking/CS goes a long way in learning how different pieces may fit together.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:57:56
Are you me? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:18:52
You’re looking at a very narrow timeframe on a very volatile investment. Give it a week or two, and hodl that shit like no tomorrow.
If you’re freaking out now, you’re in for a world of hurt in the future, lol - this correction wasn’t large by any standards (fairly average).
Don’t buy in because of FOMO (literally how shit coins reel you in and leave you holding the bag), and don’t invest what you can’t lose.
Invest smart, and assume everything you put in bitcoin will plummet to 0, and you’ll be fine. Treat it as gambling, and not somewhere to dump your 401K funds and weekly grocery funds.

This is speculative to the max...
If you look at price vs. Size of network on a logarithmic scale, the growth has actually been quite reasonable (not factoring in this 50%/day growth) — no one knows if it’s a bubble at this point... and most of the people screaming that it is dont really ground their thought in anything beyond their biased instincts

There’s the general sentiment that being tracked and companies having your information is bad, and that they’ll fucking come find you and burn your house down or something.
Companies don’t give a shit. You’re a data **point**, in an **obscenely large database**, that companies use to make their services better. If they’re going towards targeted ads and the like, this makes **your user experience better**, and helps generate the revenue needed to run their services.

Not just that, but entities or individuals can use vanilla Wall Street manipulation tactics just as easily (relative ease at least, contingent on your holdings) to manipulate BTC prices. 
But yeah, you’ve gotta be a whale — any average joe with a few BTC (or fractions of a BTC) isn’t going to be able to do anything. Couple this with the fact that many day traders are learning on the fly, not well versed in general finance/securities trading, and you can see where there’s a big gap to strike.

I honestly can’t tell if you’re trolling or just retarded. I’ve read a few white papers, and I’m also pretty sure I have a deeper technical knowledge on blockchain than you, judging from the asinine posts you pull out of your asshole.

Are you fucking stupid? If a self regulatory body doesn’t do it, the government does.
Look a good inch past your short sighted hate of the Winklevoss twins and ask yourself if what they’re proposing is actually bad. If what they’re proposed ends up being even remotely close to a ‘self-regulated’ body, it would be a massive win for the entire crypto space. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:38:26


Bitcoin **is** a blockchain.


I’d bet there are ways to do this with fiat. Your underlying assumption at the time was that bitcoin would not become regulated? With stricter policies/regulation, your run into the exact same problem in your poker games. 
There are certain applications that make blockchain shine. If you can replace the word ‘blockchain’ with ‘database’ in a use case and have the delivered value stay the same, then you don’t have a solid use case (or any reason, really) to use blockchain. Assuming regulatory practices and policies will get applied to whichever blockchain technology you’re looking is also essential because eventually, it *will* happen

@_date: 2018-02-06 18:42:02


I’ll entertain you, just because your answers sound vague af. Bitcoin was not the first implementation of a decentralized ledger system. The idea had floated around in the 80-90’s prior and the enabling technologies were definitely available before the late 2000’s. I like particularly how you lump everything in ‘countless number of uses and inventions that will better mankind’. While I do agree to an extent, wanna give me some examples? Otherwise, sounds like you’re talking out of your ass.


Inept? No. You’re making some pretty bold claims here. This statement here shows you don’t really understand how and why the government operates the way it does. Blockchain and cryptography won’t lead to an upheaval of government systems, or lead to radical changes within them. They might adopt decentralized ledgers for certain purposes, but I have no idea what lead you to even consider this.
I’d recommend doing some research and thinking about the thoughts you have before they leave your mouth. Yes, blockchain is a revolutionary technology, but making the stupid and umbrella-ing claims you’ve made doesn’t do anything to further that point.
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:26:28

That’s not the right definition of privacy to be using. You can assert that for every alt coin as well.
Would recommend giving this a quick skim:

That has nothing to do with thinking bitcoin is a ‘stable’ investment haven for dips in precious metals.

That's not the point. I agree blockchain will make its way across the world, and that it'll both create new industries and revolution existing ones.
You're pulling words out of your ass right now -- you can't even name a *single* example of **how** blockchain will do this. 


I have a decently low level understanding of blockchains. I'm going to assert - based on your comment history, that you have no idea how blockchains actually work, below the highest surface level basics.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:43:31
Your argument is totally fallible. Everyone wins when something is trending upwards; everyone thinks they’re a genius in a bull market. 
Just because bitcoin has been on the rise in the past near-decade doesn’t mean growth will continue. These crypto subs have too many people who are self proclaimed investors, who have a near zero background in quant finance, blockchain, or vanilla economics. The sheer amount of internal shilling and stupid “hodl” circlejerking reflects this, and would be funny if so many people weren’t doing it.
My personal opinion is that the market will recover, but that’s a totally different story than you basing your view on past crash-recovery cycles.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:35:16
Guess it sort of depends how you use credit cards? I’ve never had a statement that wasn’t paid 100% in full at the end of every month.
Credit cards via Coinbase are a good way to insta-buy. But yeah - for the masses, makes sense to block people who don’t have the money 
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:43:52
You have it flipped so that it’s quite literally the opposite...
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:11:19
Don’t count on it anytime soon. This is great news for Bitcoin, but Coinbase is still a shitty organization.
Edit: I spy some downvotes. I’ll amend that to **relatively** shit then. There are other large exchanges based in the US that offer better service with better features (to both the bitcoin network and its users). Bitstamp and Gemini are two better exchanges that come to mind immediately.
I’ll stand by that.
Edit 2: to name some shitty practices ...
- spamming the fuck out of the mempool, not batching transactions
- Bitcoin Cash. 
- High [proportional] number of user complaints about things like failed wires, failed withdrawal attempts, etc.
- These greedy fucks take in users even when their systems can’t scale. Other exchanges stop taking customers in when they get a huge influx of new users that they can’t handle. Coinbase? Don’t make me laugh
- The patents they file for ‘innovative’ blockchain technologies. Tell me if these sound ‘innovative’ to you:
 - bitcoin exchange
 - tips/info button 
 - hot wallet for holding bitcoin 
Edit 3: Okay, Coinbase is probably the easiest place to get started [for the masses]. That’s great. Learn the ropes, and gtfo to either **1. cold storage**, if you’re going long, or **2. a better exchange**. Not much more to it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:45:25
Works in traditional markets where models and such have been established. You’re playing in uncharted waters with crypto, and there doesn’t appear to be a market model (yet?).
Please don’t pull unbacked assertions out of your behind.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:52:13
I’ll bite. Why did you get into bitcoin? Was it the skyrocketing price that grabbed your attention, or was it seeing a really cool blockchain in action?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:28:37
Definitely. I don’t think we’re even close to an ATH; it’ll take a while though.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:10:20
I don’t agree. Market cap isn’t a fake metric at all when you’re talking about bitcoin — the value of looking at the cap number as BTC gains scale will increase. I’d agree that alt coin market cap numbers are less useful, but you can draw the same parallel to the precious metals market cap, or the market cap of a fictitious company that issues a million shares, and a dolt buying one for $600. 
To address your second point, please compare the network sizes of bitcoin and litecoin. Absolute rates of growth are a better metric than relative. Bitcoin is at a different stage in its adoption than litecoin and has first mover advantage. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:32:58


In the nicest way possible, are you fucking retarded? 


Blockchain is the single, overarching technology. Just as you’d use the umbrella term ‘internet’. I also said nothing of blockchain revolutionizing banking. Get over yourself.


Good try, I don’t work at a bank, and I’m not a quant. I’ve been in bitcoin since around half a year ago, so no - I’m not a ‘bitcoin vet’, but I’m enthusiastic about the topic and I keep up to date with what happens and understand the backend.
Not sure if you have your ass screwed where our mouth should be, but it seems it.

There’s a difference. Check out the market cap in 2011 and today. Then tell me what the market cap of bitcoin would be if we hit $1MM per coin. Maybe worth noting that there are limits in this world?
For reference, the global gold cap is around $6 trillion. 
You sound like those people that buy into a shitcoin because *“it’s priced at $0.01, so it could totally go above a dollar or two! Wow, 100x return, much easy!”*

It’s a general statement that applies to **everything**. But yes, I was referring to cryptocurrency in particular. 
You can model the equities market extraordinarily well, and firms have built algo trading bots to dominate the futures trading market. Cryptos is uncharted water in comparison, and it’s blatantly clear that cryptos, in its infancy, isn’t subject to any model you can dream up in your head.
Also, I wouldn’t make the rash assumption that I don’t understand statistics or predictive modelling, when it’s what I do for a living, lmao

Want to give me some heuristics that you’ve successfully applied? We’ll see how well they work, if you’d like to test it? 
‘Technical analyses’ appear to work in any directional market, but the second something actually happens, their ‘analysis’ goes to shit. The only real strategies that work in crypto right now are value based investing strategies that involve going long. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:58:14
