My beard may be too much for your mustache app.
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:15:47
Everything is handled with a deep investigation on an individual basis, and i can assure you, isnt handled based solely on speculation.
@_date: 2014-11-15 05:29:43
Thank you...looking into it. Give a few minutes.
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:21:27
Will do! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:46:52
I know what i said. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:01:03
I can understand. Im assuming you mean a couple weeks ago when we were "high risking" more than normal. We have since fixed that , and i only hope that at some point, you come back and give us a second chance!

Tyoing isnt a storng piont of mnie.
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:01:46
No problem, and i completely understand where youre coming from. We have a complex machine learning algorithm that determines the probability that a user is purchasing bitcoin using a stolen identity. This algorithm only applies to purchasing bitcoin with dollars and not to sells or any bitcoin-to-bitcoin transactions. The price isn’t a part of this algorithm as we have an equal proportion of flagged transactions when the price goes up or when the price goes down. When user purchases get flagged and the price has gone down, no one really says anything because they are making money. However, when user purchase is flagged and the price has gone up, people complain. Again, goes without saying, that if you think you are wrongly accused of being high risk, by all means, please reach out to support.

We love Canada! We are constantly looking to expand, and doing our best to get there!
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:32:15
Awesome question. While Reddit is a great place to engage users in conversations, we (Support) arent really doing enough to engage you as a community on our side from our company. We are looking to bolster our Community Support, which will also provide a deeper concentration into social media. We also have plans to grow our international and multi-lingual support, as well as making sure that the developer community is taken care of as well. It is recognized that Support is a huge part of the company, and that is super apparent as we grow.
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:12:43
But i think you meant an answer along the lines of "Zork".
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:10:28
Our algorithm is likely triggering that. There are a few responses in here that talk about our machine-learning algorithm, and what might trigger it. Definitely reach out to us if you want us to investigate it further.

Hi there. Awesome question. If the cancellation is because our algorithm gets sensitive, and only that reason, then the answer is yes.
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:27:26
This is really great feedback! What youre touching on all comes back to our plans for building out our community support. This includes a HUGE knowledge base, robust FAQs and a better concentration on social media to aid it. Ive always been a huge fan of empowering the user to help themselves, and love the notion of Support being there as a last resort of help. Stay tuned, as this is high on my list of things to do. EDIT: Have some gelding for the awesome feedback!
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:48:03
Apologies - My take on it, is that there are so many factors that determine a transaction to be "safe" or "risky" that build our algorithm. "High risk" can qualify any risk associated to any of the parties you listed. We air on safety with all parties. Sometimes, its a false positive, but its better safe than sorry.
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:39:45
Hey there....Ill need some more details. Can you please PM me your email address and ill look into the history of it?
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:22:42
I wouldnt worry about what people think of you. It's more important to me that we are able to help you.
Come talk to us at

We are always looking at new ways to provide you guys with many opportunities to engage with bitcoin!

Hi there, Jackten. Mick, Head of Support at Coinbase here. Can you please log a ticket with us so we can investigate this? If its easier for you, PM me the email address associated with your Coinbase acct. 
You can also open a case at,please go to

I do not get paid in bitcoin, but i buy them.
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:28:43
We offer multi-sig vaults, so that isnt entirely accurate, but i get what youre saying.
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:29:04
Please PM me the email associated with your acct, and i will look into it.
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:44:40
There isnt any correlation to that to my knowledge. Users orders get high-risk cancelled just as much, which is just as infrequent, when the price is going down rather than up.
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:34:16
Probably not.
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:05:06
We have an amazing crew here, thanks to despite a pretty hectic beginning. We are finding our rhythm, and i see improvements on metrics everyday. We have gone from about 24 hours response time to about 12 hours. Still not where i would like us to be, but we are getting there. Second, we are building out more channels for you to reach us via social media and community. Were looking at beginning that in Q1, 2015. Lastly, feedback like this from you is getting us there closer. Let us know what we can do better!
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:33:59
Of course.
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:56:11
This sounds like something that we would want to investigate. Can you open a ticket at  ?
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:45:41
I might need some clarification on your definition of centralisation. Im assuming youre talking about Coinbase's ability to be so many things for so many customers' use-cases? If that is what you mean, it boils down to us as a belief and people having a passion for all things bitcoin, and providing our customers multiple facets for engaging in it. Please correct me if i am wrong!
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:40:48
That's actually all in the terms of service, but ill state it here in my own words, not verbatem.
We are required to follow rules set by regulators that require personal information if you're making transitions beyond a specified limit. Below that, you do not have to give your personal info, but your transactions are limited.
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:56:51
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:18:30
Thats what im looking into. I want to make sure this is legit.
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:26:34
We are currently looking to work on how we publicly interact with people. is going to play a nice role with that in addition to some other exciting things!
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:25:54
I think Apple Pay is a step in the right direction in opening up the conversations people have about the trustability about "virtual pay" and "virtual currencies." Im excited for how it sways people to look into the future of payment options.
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:14:32
Id be happy to investigate, all i need is the email you opened these cases with.
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:20:10
Great to hear! First and foremost, we use the product we support, so we get it. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:43:34
AWESOME. First and foremost, im happy that youre satisfied. Beyond that, if you want to talk about it, by all means, do so. But stories like this make me feel good. Thank you for the kind words!
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:38:23
Ive tried that. Im that guy that gets stuck in the corner and cant jump his way out. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:24:59
We currently arent publicly disclosing that information, but I CAN say they are a fine group of unicorns. Pet peeve? Inefficient public transportation.
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:16:12
Completely understood, and i appreciate that. As i mentioned, we are looking for better ways to reach the bitcoin community, and giving you more information on our site, and essential help documentation within an easy reach will be key.
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:28:08
PM me anyway!
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:00:39
We currently do not have plans for that.
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:59:45
Update what? I had a bad team from the get-go. Ill never autodraft again.
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:37:25
Thank you Penny! Sometimes our wins are huge, and sometimes they are small, but we celebrate them all. I appreciate you reaching out with the kind words. :)
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:31:15
Personally, i had started off as a spectator in cryptocurrencies, slowly learning, taking it all in. Once i got involved, i am becoming kind of obsessed with the blockchain technology, and what it can offer privacy for other financial transactions, medical records, etc. Bitcoin evolves so quickly because so many insanely smart people are making it happen. Im not sure where it will be in two years for that matter. Hopefully, with the amount of positivity and engagement its gaining, it will be as widely accepted as paper is now.
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:28:30
Hey! Thanks for the feedback. I know we are hard at work on improving the app, so ill pass this along.
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:41:33
Possibly. Could you write us a note and we will take a deeper look at your case?
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:53:45
Bourbon by a landslide. Any fine bourbon or rye, neat and in my hand is the best way to end a day.

As far as i know, we since the donations are going from Coinbase to Wikipedia, it needs to come from your Coinbase account.
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:41:36
Hey there, lets look into this. Can you please open a case at  ?
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:32:28
I mean, you can never be too safe, so as far as keeping that in mind, there is always an opportunity of risk. At no point do we relax the procedures because X number of verifications have been made. We handle it all with complete due diligence.
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:24:20
Always.

Ive lost count how many times...
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:50:45
When the ticket was marked as "resolved" it was before I had an opportunity to look at it last night around 11pm PST. I too, want understanding around your entire exchange as well, so it will take some time for us to investigate it. I wont divulge any more information about your situation, because thats between you and me, but yes, there are two separate issues here.
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:31:16
Its a number of things that contribute to our algorithm, which usually airs on the side of safety. And typically, as a Coinbase user as well, id rather it was too safe, than not safe enough.
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:38:21
I appreciate your feedback. While it isnt easy to hear, it's definitely good to hear it. This is why I am here doing this. I know we arent perfect, so i want to do everything i can to make sure we are as close to as we can be.
1. Please PM me your abandoned tickets, and your affiliate program tickets, and i will personally look into them.
2. We do not do credit reporting of any kind. The transactional success and failure is based on a proprietary algorithm that is specific to our company alone. We do not use credit checks of any kind to determine eligibility for use of Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:33:46
We definitely realized that the algorithm was a bit sensitive, and over-zealous with how it marked people as "high-risk" and canceled transactions. Once we fixed it, there is still going to be some tweaking to perfect it. We apologize if your purchases are wrongly canceled, and we are more than happy to look into it if you contact Support.
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:35:21
Why would i need to? 
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:29:13
At least a bajillions.
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:31:09
While we dont have immediate plans for that, we are constantly looking for ways to give you more options to engage with bitcoin. Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:03:28
Im sorry...i didnt forget about you, i did receive it. I am looking into it. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 16:07:25
Completely understand, and it would annoy me too. But, to be fair, our ticket explained what you would need to do on your end to help us rectify the situation. As far as our end, (and to update the community), we are still looking into this specific situation as we speak.
@_date: 2014-11-15 05:24:18
Understood, but i dont know who you are from a Reddit post. If you give it to me, ill handle it personally.
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:23:45
Lets take a look.
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:30:19

Yeah, our leadership here BREATHES the industry. Its refreshing to work here. I chose this company because of a common ethos i have with my past companies; Drink your own champagne. (aka Eat your own dogfood) I want the companies to believe in themselves.

You were far more eloquent than i was. I listed medical records as a way of conveying a use that is a bit distant from what we do at Coinbase. But thank you for the great response! HAVE SOME Au!!!!!
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:13:05
Yes i do.
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:12:53
Mostly, advocacy. Ive kicked some friends and family a couple of bucks in bitcoin just to get them interested, and have an understanding of what this is were doing.
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:52:43
I should add the caveat that "between you and me" meaning, i am not going to share your information regarding the ticket on a public forum.

Hi there! Here is a quick video on depositing USD and buying BTC on the Coinbase Exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:22:39
Hey all! Mick here, Head of Support. Its kind of beautiful, really. Each department has something they want to work on, and for Support, we wanted a place that people could come and collaborate and engage in ideas. So this became our thing. But then these projects take off and begin to involve a small piece of everyone else. 
We all pitch in, fill the cracks like a team, and just get it done. We lose sleep, but I can attest to how hard we work, and how driven we are to make good products. We even intersect each other when we help out...
Specifically with the Community, the Developer's Community, which didnt really exist beyond some occasional blog posts, or a quick response to a Reddit post. Now we have a place for that. 
Im super proud of the hard work my team did building this, and im excited about what this can grow into. Obviously, I would love for you all to come over and kick the tires!
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:51:50
We have our verification processes and they have theirs. When you add the two up, it can take some time. It isnt optimal, but every day the system gets better.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:36:03
No, i had inadvertently shared a video that didnt have finishing edits.  
@_date: 2015-01-30 06:01:45
None. You actually make a good point, and sadly, some places do that. My thing is that i dont replace CS with Community, as that business model from a support standpoint would be the WORST thing anyone could do. My experience building communities for other companies has shown me that having people outside of the company engage only helps to fill in the cracks. Maybe we didnt see something that you all saw first. Let us know! Were mostly smart people here, so im going to get some good answers. Im a huge fan of a collaborative community.
@_date: 2015-01-30 06:27:11
I did too, TBH.
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:24:46
Definitely not on my roadmap.
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:47:06

Hey there, Mick from Coinbase here. We have recently discovered a malicious app that utilizes a "Terms of Service/New Service Agreement" email to access users' accounts. 
We have disabled the application and are actively investigating now.
We have a small list of affected users that we will be reaching out to directly to discuss next steps.
In the meantime, Coinbase did not send out a New User Agreement email, so please do not click anything that asks you to via this method.
We apologize for this inconvenience, and appreciate your patience.
Please reach out to me directly via DM so that we can handle this offline. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:22:45

@_date: 2015-02-03 22:19:46
We did. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:33:23
No. This was part of our NPS survey (Net Promoter Score) The redirect would have brought you to Delighted.com (a 3rd party software that we use) to provide optional comments.
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:04:46
I agree, customers should be cautious and vigilant, but what made it difficult was that it literally had our name in it, which shouldnt be happening.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:10:36
We took responsibility for this one because the application should NOT have been able to use the Coinbase name.
