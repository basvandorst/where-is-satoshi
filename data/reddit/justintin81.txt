@_date: 2017-12-20 08:58:00
I wish my exchangessss would credit my fiat for me to buy the dip and now it's backing up... sigh...
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:13:08

@_date: 2017-12-07 06:31:34
Hope that guy hodl on to his 40k coins till now ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:37:21
So this is more like the weekend deep and had nothing to do with people staying away whilst awaiting for the futures
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:10:38
Also I'm referring to 4 coins here not BTC alone, maybe u have misunderstood 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:31:30

@_date: 2017-12-21 15:15:24
Nah it's good as we can buy more ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:52:27
I was gonna wait to see if they deposit my funds deposited locally from a domestic bank account from 18/12, but I must ask for help now as they have now banned me from their subreddit.
I've posted the same comments on r/Gatecoin as well and have not been banned yet, screen captured!
It's not a small amount of fiat, why the fuxk they doing this????

@_date: 2017-12-03 12:31:50
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:50:23
Unfortunately I'm not on an exchange that can buy them ripple and doge ��
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:00:11
Well I'm getting downvoted...  someone is disliking me talking about fishy stuffs.
It's logical - I truely wanted (past tense) to put $ into bch, but the way they market it makes u wonder what's behind the BCH volatility..... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:20:37

Unfortunately many people from older generations cannot take a lot of risks...
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:43:52
Well the main thing is, what is making it rise and ends the dip? Seems so difficult to find an answer to that
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:29:07
If you care to read their FAQ regarding their transfer cutoff time, you will know why
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:16:32
Looking forward to it ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:53:50
Good point here 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:14:59
So it's wrong to warn ppl about a crap exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:06:04
Yup I've missed the rollercoaster excitement ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:44:57
Well pay 33% to him is better than losing it all, as he has the power to completely take them away and keep for himself 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:16:35
Yeah bro I'm a hodler, just looking for entry points to pickup more ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:50:03

@_date: 2017-12-22 11:15:48

@_date: 2017-12-22 19:12:46
Get your facts right, Gatecoin is an exchange that supports BTC!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:12:43
Yes this!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:17:51

Well talking BTC ETH LTC BCH here... 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:17:55
It's definitely a scam ��
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:53:25
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:51:58
Well, but to be able to short bitcoin, someone needs to buy it first :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:17:31
Yes and especially now it's on the way to $0!��
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:07:28
I think this is the r/bitcoin culture, i think it's totally acceptable
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:05:13
Possibly 
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:30:09
Well looks like BCH it's heading towards $0 direction ��
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:03:49
oh shit.... :( no wonder the app didn't work... 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:04:25
And then? $2500 for 15 mins is what you want us to see?
