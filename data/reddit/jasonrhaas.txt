Yes I know, I used Coinbase strictly for the experiment.  But in practice if I were buying and selling of Bitcoins I would not use Coinbase.

I can't help but thinking this is like the Gold speculation bubble of 2009.  I'm not saying Bitcoin doesn't have real value -- it certainly does.  But the rampant speculation means there is a reckoning coming.  That might be the time to buy.

Yea I think the dollar crashing would be good for Bitcoin and probably Gold as well.  Check on the "bitcoins".  Plugging Ethereum at the end was kind of a joke, but I'll admit the smart contracts are pretty interesting!  Geez everyone is so sensitive on this forum.

Yea I knew about gdax after researching but I chose to use Coinbase because it seems like the most "widely used".  I'm still very pro bitcoin and blockchain technology.  The real problem isnt' bitcoin, its the ecosystem IMO.

I realize that there are many ways to get Bitcoin, I was trying to come at it from a person brand new to Bitcoin and trying to buy something with it.  I approached it from a purely practical standpoint, ie I want to buy something with Bitcoin.. whats the most practical and easy way to do that?

Actually that's a good idea, I think I will run another bitcoin experiment, trying to do the same thing but this time minimizing fees, maximizing anonymity and security.  Its probably possible with enough effort and research to accomplish this.  My main point (and grant you I might not have made it well), was that the Bitcoin enthusiasts already know the best ways to use Bitcoin.  But the ecosystem (as it stands right now), is not friendly to new users and is not a practical way to do transactions.
I'm not blaming Bitcoin for this, the technology is great.  It seems like maybe its a failure of the ecosystem itself, or maybe we just haven't figured out the best way to do it yet.
Also to respond to your point about my agenda - I really didn't have an agenda with this article other than to share my experience buying something with Bitcoin.  Most people I know that have Bitcoin just let it sit under a mattress (and watch the price go up).  So to me, that is not a true currency -- its just Digital Gold.

It _should_ be fine as long as you are paying your taxes.  Honestly I think the IRS scrutiny can only be good for Bitcoin, because paying taxes on it like any other asset only legitimizes it as an investment product.

Good points.  I totally get that the way I went about getting Bitcoin and spending them was not the most efficient way I could have done it.  I know I could have reduced my fees, and I know you can go out of your way to try to get bitcoins using cash to avoid having your information available to a 3rd party.
I should have made clear in the article that I realize this might not be the *best* way to use Bitcoin... but again coming it from a "noob" perspective, it seemed like the most convenient way to buy things with Bitcoin.
Also -- Bitcoin ATM's are not anonymous.  A lot of those things have cameras on them that track your face with the transaction.
