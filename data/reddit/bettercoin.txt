There are currently no such thing as "bitcoin micropayments"; they are not supported, because:
* They are too expensive, given the current transaction fee defauts in place for end-user clients, relays, and miners.
* The Bitcoin network cannot handle them; it would essentially cause a denial of service.
These are serious issues that very few people really care even to acknowledge.
@_date: 2014-11-03 06:44:12
Just to say it a bit more succinctly:
* Deflation of prices transfers buying power from the entire economy to savers.
* Inflation of the money supply transfers buying power from savers to the issuers of money (the government).
    * Basic income is just like inflation of the money supply, except that the government hands back \[some of\] the buying power to everybody else; overall, the government and the wastrels gain buying power, while the savers lose buying power.

    Make an app to facilitate this.
* Hide a private key so someone can collect a reward.

@_date: 2014-12-05 02:56:35
**We're talking about micropayments** (think of ChangeTip tips bouncing around), which inherently tend to involve high rates of turn-over due to the way addresses are used, priority is calculated, etc.; that means we're talking about a higher probability that not only will a transaction be unconfirmed, but that its *inputs* will be unconfirmed, leading to a chain of unconfirmed transactions.
It was thought that this doesn't matter, because you just have to wait for them to be confirmed one by one. However, because of transaction malleability, even honest users of bitcoin cannot be trusted in this circumstance (**a user cannot trust his own transaction!**), because a third-party (not necessarily even a malicious one) can throw a wrench into the works.
So, for micropayments with Bitcoin proper, the system is inherently unstable, and thus people are forced to wait for confirmations.

I agree. I like using ChangeTip.
However, even a toe can be bitten off.
ChangeTip essentially represents Bitcoin's failure to handle both microtransactions and rapid transactions (transaction malleability), as well as the community's failure to develop decentralized ways of identifying where to send a tip (OneName?) and how much to send (conversions).

This should always be your first description of Bitcoin:
* Traditionally, when you want to pay somebody else digitally, you tell a third-party payment processor (like Mastercard) to process the transaction for you. The Bitcoin network is just another third-party payment processor; the main difference is that anybody on the Internet can participate in processing transactions, so you don't have to rely on one centralized organization (like Mastercard) to run things.
    Of course, in order for this to work, you have to use the Bitcoin network's currency rather than the dollar; the Bitcoin network's currency is the "bitcoin".
Next you can explain:
* Payment processing is just one thing computers on the Internet can do; you can actually use this same technology to do any other sort of computation. In other words, Bitcoin software provides a foundation for distributing computing tasks across a large number of computers on the Internet without having to trust any one of them in particular to do the right thing.
    Currently, the Bitcoin network cannot do such generalized distributed computation, but there are a number of ventures that are trying to make it a reality in the near future.
*Now* you can talk about blocks, hashes, blockchains, and the like.

That is a restriction of governments, not people; American constitutions were \[originally] written to restrict governments; the whole point was to prevent governments from paying people with fiat currencies, as the founders were well acquainted with the abuse of inflationary debasement.
According to the U.S. Contitution, government can only pay its debts with gold and silver, but the people can use whatever they want; of course, if a person seeks compensation through government courts, then the courts (being an arm of the government) can only demand that this compensation be payed in legal tender (i.e., gold and silver).
Naturally, though, goverments have been breaking this constitutional law since the dollar was decoupled from gold.

Let me speak concretely so that you might understand.
Let's say the U.S. institutes a blacklist that businesses must follow in the U.S., but Switzerland does not require this blacklist be used. Then, a resident of the U.S. could simply swap his blacklisted coins with a resident of Switzerland who has coins that would be considered clean in the U.S.; the American spends in the U.S. the previously Swiss-owned coins, and the Swiss spends in Switzerland the previously American-owned coins.

There have been numerous bugs in the software; the original version produced by Satoshi was junk, and has taken years to get into the current state, which still leaves a lot to be desired.
* [At one point]( somebody tricked the Bitcoin network into thinking he had ***B***illions of bitcoins; it was fixed by forgetting hours' worth of transactions.
* Satoshi himself didn't appreciate the fact that only the network gets to say who owns what, leading to the "malleable" transaction problem, which resulted in many millions of dollars worth of stolen bitcoins.

No, they wouldn't have raised the price of Bitcoin by that logic; as already explained, there should be an increase in velocity. It could very well result in a redistribution of Bitcoins.
Secondly, why do this conversion? Because it's currently safer to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange rather than as a store of value; the conversion loop is just the necessary overhead required of testing the system rather than relying on it. More importantly, though, people might participate in this loop just to avoid issues with credit card fraud or privacy, making the overhead a worthwhile "fee" for protection.

* It doesn't beg the question because I wasn't addressing the particular issue at hand; I was merely pointing out that your appeal to antiquity is not sufficient.
* With regard to the issue at hand, this last response of yours is mostly a straw man; we are not discussing the narrow subject of physical prowess, but rather the larger question of whether men are indeed "superior in the workplace and in the great creative ventures outside the family circle".
    &gt; why have men so consistently - across time, space, culture, religion, and ethnicity - occupied one sphere, and women the other?
    The world has hitherto been kept in line by physical strength; the strong always overpower the weak—regardless of gender; *someone* has to wash the laundry and wipe the babies' asses instead of pondering the meaning of life, so it's not too surprising that the ones who end up *needing* to do grunt work are the ones most vulnerable to physical intimidation.
    As civilization has become more advanced, differences in physical strength have become less important, and efficiency has replaced grunt work with leisure activity. The result is the great insight of the 20th century: Women are as mentally capable as men.
    Because the workplace and creative ventures are increasingly cerebral, we can thus say that it is at least no longer the case that men are "superior in the workplace and in the great creative ventures outside the family circle".

You're neglecting the hidden tax: Inflation.
The government prints it's local currency to pay for things, thereby transferring purchasing power to the government from every holder of that currency; this is not possible with bitcoin.
So, by holding your wealth in bitcoin, you are "magically" not paying the inflation tax. In fact, with an ultimately deflationary currency like bitcoin, holding your wealth in bitcoin means that you transfer to yourself the purchasing power created by new efficiencies in the economy.

You're neglecting the hidden tax: Inflation.
The government prints it's local currency to pay for things, thereby transferring purchasing power to the government from every holder of that currency; this is not possible with bitcoin.
So, by holding your wealth in bitcoin, you are "magically" not paying the inflation tax. In fact, with an ultimately deflationary currency like bitcoin, holding your wealth in bitcoin means that you transfer to yourself the purchasing power created by new efficiencies in the economy.

At one point in time, it was very common to use a conjunction after a semicolon. In fact, it's still very common to do so when the semicolon is used as a way to separate list items that are so complex that commas alone are insufficient to delineate boundaries; this is particularly true in legalese, which cannot afford the space required for bullet points. For instance, consider this use of bullet points to separate very complex items of a list:
* When the old man died, he bequeathed his belongings to a number of people:
    * The nice girl who brought him fruit, vegetables, meat, bread, and beer every week.
    * His brother in Conneticut, but not his brother in New York.
    * The nearby church, even though he was an atheist.
    * Finally, the animal shelter, so that there would be funds enough to take care of his 2 dogs, Pluto and Annabel.
These could be compressed into a paragraph by using semicolons:
* When the old man died, he bequeathed his belongings to a number of people: the nice girl who brought him fruit, vegetables, meat, bread, and beer every week; his brother in Conneticut, but not his brother in New York; the nearby church, even though he was an atheist; **and**, finally, to the animal shelter, so that there would be funds enough to take care of his 2 dogs, Pluto and Annabel.
Just try doing that *without* the semicolon! A period doesn't make sense, because each item of the list isn't a complete sentence. More to the point, a comma isn't suitable, because it might compete with a comma embedded in the item itself.
As for the main use of the semicolon outlined previously, it makes sense to follow a semicolon with a conjunction only if it makes sense to follow a period with a conjunction**. But**, sometimes, you have to write whatever makes sense in the moment, because communication is sometimes more art than science.

In a democracy, every entity's vote carries the same weight as every other entity's vote; this is not the case in the Bitcoin system, which instead does exactly what the *majority-holders* of assets say to do.
The more assets you control (i.e., the more important your mining infrastructure, etc.), the more important your vote is.
This is good, because it means that the system at any given time is most likely to be maintained by those who will appropriate resources well (as long as there's a free market); **so, the only important question is whether there is a free market.**
Under Bitcoin, the landowners are the voters, and the more land one owns, the more important one's vote is. You are probably not a landowner—but that just means your vote would probably be stupid anyway (at least under a free market), so that's quite all right.
More to the point: There is no voting in the Bitcoin system; rather, people just *do* whatever they can get away with doing, and from their doings emerges the Bitcoin system.

You want to know who should choose how to appropriate capital? The people who gained control of that capital in the first place through voluntary means.
Self-governance means capitalism, not democracy.
Put succinctly: I will never contribute my capital to your treasury willingly, because I think you'll probably appropriate it incompetently. You'll have to force me to contribute, by threatening me with violence; you'll have to institute "taxation".

Tax money is spent on:
* **Good things**. Because I think these things are good, I'd purchase them voluntarily even without a tax. Thus, these things have no bearing on the question.
* **Bad things**. Because I think these things are bad, the only way you're going to get me to purchase them is if you take my money by force—**theft**.
**Taxation is theft.**

I'm guessing you misunderstood me; I'm supporting For most of human history, trust in a tool of sufficient complexity was tied to trust in its creator. However, under open source, *anyone* is able to determine the trustworthiness by understanding it's nature fully—by essentially becoming the creator himself.

It's important to understand that the one who knows a "private key" ( which is just a big number) is the one who can spend the bitcoins associated with that private key.
A wallet from which you can spend your coins is essentially just a collection these private keys. If you get access to those private keys, then you can spend the coins just by telling the Bitcoin network to do so. The network knows nothing about 2FA.
Now, in the future, some system like Bitcoin—or perhaps built on top of Bitcion—might well be aware of 2FA and how to use it to prevent the movement of funds, but this is not the case yet.

If you're worried about your children ordering drugs and firearms on Amazon, then you've got a shitload more to worry about than whether such a service exists. How did your children get to this point in their behavior? The condemnation lies not in the service, but rather in the so-called "family man".
Put another way: Would you rather this problematic (or perhaps naively curious) child of yours instead went searching to buy such paraphernalia in the dark corners of a seedy alley? I doubt it&amp;hellip; Amazon Drugs^TM starts to sound a lot more appealing to the family man.
In short: All of what you say sounds very reasonable and moderate; the problem with moderates is that they think there is one solution, and that it's simply a matter of getting all the "leaders" to figure out that one solution.
That's why they don't pay attention to the powers that be, because they assume that's what they're up to. However, the power of government attracts control-freaks, sociopaths, and opportunists—hence the outcomes that we have today, all allowed by the indifferent moderates.
There's no one-size fits-all solution to be found by a small cabal of "thinkers". The solution will vary geographically, socio-economically, and culturally, and it must be discovered through the decentralized trial and error of capitalism.
The solution starts with how you, the family man, handle the situation yourself.

Nobody asked about verifying without internet access. That's not what we're talking about.
People don't go around making sure every fiat bill they receive is genuine; why would they need to do so with a bitcoin-backed bill?
A well-established standard for the manufacture of such bills would be enough for the vast majority of commerce in a particular locality, as with fiat; indeed, the U.S. dollar, for example, used to be a promissory note that could be exchanged for the asset that backed it: Gold. Did people go check the Treasury every damn time they received a bill? Do you mark every bill you receive with fraud-detection pen, or do you examine them closely for the special security features? No.
Now, such a note could be exchanged for digital bitcoin even without having to go to a centralized treasury: You just destroy the bill to access the private key and feed it into a computer.
Indeed, you don't even need Internet for validation, just a computing system that has a sufficiently up-to-date blockchain on it. Maybe a local business provides this service for you.
What with wirelessly powered, wirelessly communicating, thin devices embedded in such a bill, you could even make cryptographic verifications in bulk without destroying the bills.

The transaction malleability problem makes it nearly impossible to build chains of transactions in which most transactions are not yet securely confirmed.
This actually makes Bitcoin highly inconvenient:
You must remember that multiple previous transactions are used as inputs to produce the right quantity for the intended payment, and this usually overshoots, thus creating a "change" address; that is, every time you spend bitcoins, you're creating new inputs that are not yet confirmed, and thus the source of coins from which you can pull to make a *well-defined* payment can easily become exhausted.
Say you buy a coffee with raw bitcoin rather than through a centralized clearinghouse like ChangeTip; you're likely going to get "change" back, usually at another address. Then, you might decide you'd actually like that candy bar, after all; well, when you go to pay for it, your wallet may have to pull funds from that change address, which is not yet confirmed. Things get really hairy, and it can actually be a disaster that confuses both software and people, or results in a "denied" payment or even the equivalent of a chargeback.
The larger the chain of unconfirmed transactions, the more likely that someone can throw a wrench into the works by using the transaction malleability quirk.

Wrong on all counts.
***Bitcoin is inflationary*** in the sense that the money supply is monotonically increasing, *but* a booming bitcoin economy *might* lead to net deflation of *prices*; of course, a souring economy might lead to stagnation in prices, or even increasing prices.
* Deflation of prices transfers buying power from the entire economy to savers.
* Inflation of the money supply transfers buying power from savers to the issuers of money (the government, the Bitcoin miners, etc.).
Deflation is a good thing, unless you think the issuers of money (namely, governments) are the best at appropriating capital.

Thanks for the tip!


I would say that you did not.
The semicolon has a number of uses, but I would say that the main use is to connect 2 highly related sentences. For instance, it is common to see something like the following:
* I had a really good time**,** his guitar playing was the most spectacular thing I've ever seen!
That's an incorrect use of the comma to link 2 highly related, but grammatically distinct sentences. That is, the comma *should* be a period:
* I had a really good time**. H**is guitar playing was the most spectacular thing I've ever seen!
However, that destroys the notion that these sentences are meant to be highly related, which is especially valuable to convey when they are surrounded by a lot of other sentences; thus, the comma is kind of combined with the period to form a semicolon (which is, as the name implies, *almost* a colon):
* I had a really good time**; h**is guitar playing was the most spectacular thing I've ever seen!

It's not a measurement of "used addresses", but rather a measurement of "***unique*** used addresses"; I assume this "unique" qualification pertains to whether only one transaction sends value to an address.
In other words, if an address is re-used (i.e., coins are sent back to an address that has already been used before), then that address is indeed used but no longer unique.
Hence, the graph shows that a lot of brand new address have been created recently, and the graph goes down in places because addresses are being re-used (and thus uniqueness is being destroyed).
Now, give me karma or coins.

The Bitcoin blockchain is just data. The network effect is not so much that a bunch of nodes are running Bitcoin software, but rather that a bunch of people have data tied to the history recorded by the Bitcoin blockchain.
Keep the same history, but update the software, and do so in such a way that bitcoin value can be used in the same way as ether, and that's all you need.
Why should I have to pay bitcoin to get ether to run distributed programs? Just cut out the middleman, and design the software to connect Bitcoin history into a bitcoin-based Etherium-like future.

I didn't say people should always be able to burn bitcoin XCP; after all, since burning is equivalent to mining a reward as per the developers, burning could stop after a sufficient amount of time just like the block reward will stop after a sufficient amount of time.
What if Satoshi designed Bitcoin to stop the block reward shortly after a small group of insiders and early-early-early adopters did some mining? Would that have not been a kind of pre-mining?
Why couldn't people continue to burn at an exponentially decreasing rate of return? Just like the mining reward.

**Bitcoin has NEVER BEEN democratic. It's Capitalistic.**
In a democracy, every entity's vote carries the same weight as every other entity's vote; this is not the case in the Bitcoin system, which instead does exactly what the *majority-holders* of assets say to do.
The more assets you control (i.e., the more important your mining infrastructure, etc.), the more important your vote is.
This is good, because it means that the system at any given time is most likely to be maintained by those who will appropriate resources well (as long as there's a free market); **so, the only important question is whether there is a free market.**
Under Bitcoin, the landowners are the voters, and the more land one owns, the more important one's vote is. You are probably not a landowner—but that just means your vote would probably be stupid anyway (at least under a free market), so that's quite all right.
More to the point: There is no voting in the Bitcoin system; rather, people just *do* whatever they can get away with doing, and from their doings emerges the Bitcoin system.

It's actually not completely correct in my opinion, at least in how it has been rendered or keyed. So, no; you're not the only one who has had trouble.
Basically, there are multiple functions being plotted on the same axes, and then the area between "adjacent" (if you will) function plots is being colored.
So, take the "bottom" function:
* f(date) = out of all the bitcoins in circulation on the given date, this is percentage of them that have hitherto been sitting around for at most a day.
That function is plotted as the top of the very bottom blue area in the graph.
The "next" function is in terms of week old coins rather than day old; however, it's unclear whether that means "up to one week" or "up to one week, but ~~more~~ certainly more than 1 day".

The thing is, Bitcoin is actually very poorly specified—it's much more complex in practice than that which is *sketched* in Satoshi's seminal white paper, or as outlined across various chat forums and email databases and wikis.
So, the only so-called specification is actually the "reference" client, whose bugs tend to become features due to the fear of rocking the boat.
In short, then, I would be very wary of an "implementation" that doesn't provide damn good evidence for compatibility with the "reference" client.

People are demonstrably over-paying, especially when the block-reward is still so high. Fees shouldn't even be an issue for quite some time to come.
The problem is that hard-coded values were used, especially in client software, without any thought about Bitcoin gaining so much in value while they were in place.
Gavin has implemented a feature that attempts to be "smart" about choosing a fee that will likely get your transaction put into the very next block, but it does so by analyzing what other people are spending on the transaction fee, and what they are spending is currently inflated.
Basically, people aren't allowed to set the fee they want very easily, and there's very little indication as to what a suitable fee would be for a given rate of inclusion into the blockchain, anyway.
The market is completely deranged.

That being said, without having read your paper yet, it seems to me that the use of bitcoin as a currency and the use of bitcoin as an investment cannot be separated *in&amp;nbsp;theory*; they are one and the same.
If you buy bitcoin to hodl down, you can still use that bitcoin to make purchases of everyday goods and services. It's a stock in the Bitcoin economy, which itself can be traded for goods and services—and, frankly, that's no different than the U.S. dollar being a stock in the U.S. dollar economy, which itself can be traded for goods and services.

* As soon as I receive a tip through ChangeTip, I can turn around and pass it off to someone else; this doesn't work so well with raw bitcoin, because it would require making new transactions based on unconfirmed or poorly confirmed transactions.
    Indeed, the transaction "malleability" bug showed us that this can (could?) cause a lot of horrible problems, even when you're using a transaction that you yourself think is trustworthy.
    I mean, look: Say you buy a coffee with raw bitcoin; you're likely going to get "change" back, usually at another address. Then, you might decide you'd actually like that candy bar, after all; well, when you go to pay for it, your wallet may have to pull funds from that change address, which is not yet confirmed. Things get really hairy, and it can actually be a disaster that confuses both software and people, or results in a "denied" payment or even the equivalent of a chargeback.
* Microtransactions are particularly irritating, because not only do small amounts tend to exchange hands quickly (I may disburse a $5 tip I just received to 5 $1 tips to other people, all within 10 minutes, certainly less than the usual hour), but they also require a proportionally huge transaction fee.

No, it does not. *Capitalism* describes Bitcoin and its effects.
**Bitcoin has NEVER BEEN democratic. It's Capitalistic.**
In a democracy, every entity's vote carries the same weight as every other entity's vote; this is not the case in the Bitcoin system, which instead does exactly what the *majority-holders* of assets say to do.
The more assets you control (i.e., the more important your mining infrastructure, **etc.**), the more important your vote is.
This is good, because it means that the system at any given time is most likely to be maintained by those who will appropriate resources well—as long as there's a free market; **so, the only important question is whether there is a free market.**
Under Bitcoin, the landowners are the voters, and the more land one owns, the more important one's vote is. You are probably not a landowner—but that just means your vote would probably be stupid anyway (at least under a free market), so that's quite all right. *Don't take this analogy too far*.

You could say the same about Bitcoin, only there are so many people now with such a large quantity of wealth accounted in bitcoin that it would be difficult to wrest them away to your competing system.
The same cannot be said for Counterparty, and that is what is meant by a lack of network effect. By allowing more people to tie their wealth to XCP, they would make a competitor that much less likely to transfer value away from Counterparty.
My point stands strong.
If Counterparty succeeds, it will be due mostly to apathy from competitors, not due to Counterparty being a superior system.

Ask yourself: Why is that wealth (bitcoins) increasing in value (just by holding onto it)? It's because of:
* *Overproduction due to malinvestment.* In this case, the deflation leads to a liquidation of overproduction and a signal to reduce production. **That's good.**
* *An increase in the world's productivity.* **That's good.** And, if the world's productivity slows, then the currency's deflation slows until holding onto it is no longer the most attractive investment—it becomes a better investment to put money into those businesses; this makes people invest wisely. **That's good.**

I actually took the wrong approach to answering you.
The Bitcoin situation is the same: The entire bitcoin economy has increased in value, but the bitcoin has decreased in value (since some suitably chosen time in the past).
Where your comparison is erroneous is in defining what "counterfeit" means. Just like the dollar, the bitcoin is actually inflationary, in the sense that the bitcoin supply is increasing with every block reward.
However, this money creation in the bitcoin world is a transparent process to which people agree upfront; the rules are known, and they are not likely to change.
The orange to this apple is that the inflation of the dollar supply is completely at the whim of an opaque group of centralized bureaucrats; because nobody is able to agree to their function upfront, their behavior is more akin to counterfeiting than to management of the system.
@_date: 2014-12-06 20:37:30
Well, the dollar has lost approximately 98% of its value since 1913, so that must mean that approximately 2% of dollars are not counterfeits.

Thanks! Your tip got "confirmed and collected" automatically; I apologize if it appeared that I simply took it and then ignored you.
Certainly, your tip has contributed to my desire to respond with something at least moderately useful!


These are some pretty good resources on the subject:
* ["The" Bitcoin Wiki article](
* [A BitcoinTalk post on PPLNS](
Essentially, P2Pool is genius in that it basically creates it's own mini Bitcoin network with a more advanced mining protocol; miners work on "shares" rather than "blocks", and those shares get strung into a "sharechain" rather than a "blockchain". Despite the differences in names, these concepts are virtually identifical, especially because some "shares" can be submitted to the actual Bitcoin network as valid "blocks"; this has the fantastic property of baking into each "share" exactly what each miner is due in both rewards and fees, which is transparent and trustworthy as per Bitcoin itself.
Amazing, right? It's simple and yet powerful; it's downright sexy.
Nevertheless, it's fundamentally not much better.
* With Bitcoin proper, the blockchain entails all blocks back to the beginning of time. With P2Pool, the sharechain only remembers and values a day's worth (or so) of shares. Once your share is forgotten, you won't get paid for it, a fact that disproportionately and negatively affects small computing contributions.
* As with mining blocks for the blockchain, a share that you find might become worthless if someone else finds a longer chain of valid shares that doesn't include your share. This disproportionately and negatively affects small computing contributions.
* As with Bitcoin, the difficulty in finding a share increases with the computing power put to the task of finding shares. This is exactly the same problem that lead to centralization in Bitcoin proper.
In short, Bitcoin treats having found a block as a proxy for having contributed meaningful computing power to the network, but what we have seen is that the current rules frequently result in ignoring meaningful contributions. P2Pool improves on the situation, but not fundamentally.
I guess it's a tough problem to provide proof that someone has actually performed meaningful work. ;-)

I believe Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum has noted that colored coins are the superior concept for such things, and so I agree with you on the front; they certainly work with SPV clients, while Counterparty does not.
As an aside, what's particularly interesting about Counterparty is that it started out as just a platform for Bitcoin-based asset creation and exchange, but it's developers seemingly discovered in the course of their work that it provides a foundation for a much more generalized platform that just happens to have been first specialized for those tasks; after they ported Ethereum's programming language, they began discussing reimplementing much of their original features on top of that Etherium layer in order to make the core code that much simpler.

Forgive me; I misunderstood.
How do you intend to set the initial value (in Euros) of your new currency?
Anyway, once your value has been established, to keep stability with respect to the Euro, you'd have to implement monetary policy (most likely issuing new units of your currency, possibly to all stakeholders to keep things decentralized). This is an onerous task; the easiest solution is to have centralized control of such a thing, but using Serpent (Etherium's programming language) to achieve the same might also be possible, and also works with Counterparty, apparently.
Of course, the very easiest solution is to back your currency directly with the Euro, thereby setting its value and automatically maintaining stability in terms of the Euro—but this would need to be highly centralized, because fungibility with the Euro would be key. You'd have to set up a treasury, where there is held one Euro for each unit of your new currency, and where users of your currency would be guaranteed the ability to exchange your currency units for the equivalent amount of Euros, perhaps with restrictions on minimum conversions.
Also, as [cryptard points out]( By storing your information in the blockchain, you'd be required to use Bitcoin, *anyway*, which makes it really unwieldy. Maybe sidechains make this less of an issue.
In short, it sounds unworkable in the near term.

This is acually a really big deal.
The transaction malleability problem makes it nearly impossible to build chains of transactions in which most transactions are not yet securely confirmed.
This actually makes Bitcoin highly inconvenient for the quick turnover inherent in micropayments:
You must remember that multiple previous transactions are used as inputs to produce the right quantity for the intended payment, and this usually overshoots, thus creating a "change" address; that is, every time you spend bitcoins, you're creating new inputs that are not yet confirmed, and thus the source of coins from which you can pull to make a *well-defined* payment can easily become exhausted.
Say you buy a coffee with raw bitcoin rather than through a centralized clearinghouse like ChangeTip; you're likely going to get "change" back, usually at another address. Then, you might decide you'd actually like that candy bar, after all; well, when you go to pay for it, your wallet may have to pull funds from that change address, which is not yet confirmed. Things get really hairy, and it can actually be a disaster that confuses both software and people, or results in a "denied" payment or even the equivalent of a chargeback.
The larger the chain of unconfirmed transactions, the more likely that someone can throw a wrench into the works by using the transaction malleability quirk.

Really, what this all comes down to is determining the value of hosting the blockchain; as it is now, there's not necessarily a way to tell how valuable that contribution actually is—it may be a waste of time or it may be instrumental.
* If you're a merchant, it may be enough to treat the cost of running a full node as a cost of business; the expense is worth knowing that your copy of the blockchain can be trusted, and that the web of nodes to which you connect can be trusted.
* However, the calculation becomes more difficult when you're simply just trying to bolster the network. In this case, it would be great to get paid both to host the blockchain and to relay transactions, but I suspect that it would be enough for many people just to know exactly how much more robust their individual contributions are making the network.
    Perhaps the real solution is as simple as just modeling the possible attacks as a function of nodes, and then reporting somewhere the marginal gains each new node would add, so that people can rationalize running a full node or not; if your contribution makes the network 1% "more robust" (as determined by the model), then it might be compelling to contribute at the current cost, but if the contribution makes the network 0.00000001% "more robust", then, well, *forget it!*—the network doesn't need me.
    In a sense, that would be the same as determining the profitability by getting paid.

While that might be a symptom, it's not the root problem.
Inflation centralizes the power to allocate a large amount of society's capital; were the government actually better at allocating capital than the people from whom capital is stolen, then inflation would leave society better off. However, this is rarely the case; government tends to allocate a lot of capital very poorly, and society thus suffers, forcing people to compete like savages for the scraps.
This is the point of capitalism: It is usually better to leave the allocation of capital in the hands of each party who created that capital in the first place; leave investment to investors who have proven themselves shrewd.

* Take the exact same blockchain, but start processing it with different software. If it's backward's compatible, it's an upgrade to Bitcoin; if it's not, it's a new altcoin.

Please. You are betraying your ignorance of both the philosophical and technical heritage of Bitcoin.
For one thing, git uses merkle trees to present a cryptographically secured, philosophically distributed record of events, where the more deeply buried an event gets, the more unlikely it will be that its record can be altered. In some sense, automated integration testing serves as a proof-of-work mechanism.
Now, simplify the process by making Adam Back's hashcash the proof of work, updated to account for increasing computing power. Next, choose the longest history to be the best history. Then, add age-old monetary incentives to make the system self-reinforcing. Voila! Bitcoin.
To me, the most insightful aspect of Bitcoin is that from very early on, Satoshi recognized that processing value transactions is just one specialized computation that a node can perform; Satoshi realized that generalized computation is possible (e.g., Ethereum), and thus built the foundation for such computing into Bitcoin itself right from the beginning. Interestingly, and perhaps most amazingly, Satoshi disabled generalized computing because he was uncertain of the ramifications, particularly for a young network.
However, none of that is relevant to the point at hand: The point that Satoshi's insight was evolutionary, not revolutionary.

Stefan: "If you want to look for the abuse of power in your life, look at those who commanded your life when you were young, and get those people out of your life, **unless you love them to death, in which case more power to you, I think that's wonderful**, but it's not the case."
More to the point, though, it seems that he goes on to say that:
* a person's relationship with his parents
* and a person's relationship with "his" government
are reflections of each other, and are self-reinforcing, because it is a matter of culture. Thus, to want to separate yourself from an abusive relationship with government is the same as wanting to separate yourself from an abusive relationship with your parents.
In other words, to be truly involved in this philosophy he's peddling, you must not allow yourself to be trapped by the contradictions of compartmentalization. By being unwilling to separate yourself from your parents, you are actually unwilling to separate yourself from the larger system, because the power dynamic is one and the same.

Bitcoin has the foundation for a generalized forth-like language to program the validity of a transfer; as far as I understand it, this full power has not been tapped, and as time goes on, implementing it fully just gets harder, because it depends on all the nodes agreeing to implement it fully.
Bitcoin has massive potential for this sort of thing, but it's pretty much vaporware, as everyone is afraid to touch the beast directly. Competing projects with these goals in mind have also been pretty much vaporware.

* &gt;  In the early days, a home PC could produce hundreds of bitcoins a day; now, a state of the art mining machine can expect to mine only a fraction of a bitcoin a day. We estimate that the energy power devoted to bitcoin mining has increased by a factor of at least 10 billion. Most of this is pure waste as the system could be maintained on a single server. A single operator could avoid most of this waste.
    A single operator is not cheaper, because it would cost giving up decentralization.
    Securing the network is *not* a waste.
    Every now and then somebody makes a post about how terrible it is that a block got mined without including any transaction except for the miner's reward. However, every block secures the previous blocks that much more.
    Everybody, say it with me: Securing the network is *not* a waste.
* &gt; One could imagine Uncle Sam being very interested... The likelihood is that the government would destroy anonymity at a stroke by requiring that the dominant player insist that users register themselves by providing photo ID, social security numbers and proof of address.
    It's important to remember that Bitcoin is not an American phenomenon. I seriously doubt the Chinese Government is going to let the U.S. Government dominate Bitcoin if it becomes a major economic system. And, I bet the Governments of Europe wouldn't care to be stuck between the two in such an economic war. The Russian Government might have something to say as well. South America, under the leadership of the Brazilian Government, will probably end up being a huge player.

The problem is taking resources without consent.
When an organization does this, what does it matter whether it's called a "corporation" or a "government"? They are one in the same.
In modern society, the act of taking resources without consent is simply centralized in a monopoly called "government"; this monopoly then sells its services to corporations; it's smoke and mirrors for one in the same thing—it's just refactoring the one problem: Taking resources without consent.

At a centralized exchange, a person cannot hide from taxes or fees. However, when confronted with the opportunity to transact in a way that a lack of reporting can be safely achieved, most people will gladly evade taxes.

Before, this was only possible with cash in hand, and there's only so much of that you can carry around, and only so far you can carry it. Bitcoin exceeds those limits.

So, please target your videos towards the counterculture—towards the future movers and shakers.
Specifically, make a video about a young "starving artist" whose parents/girlfriend/whatever give him shit about spending all his efforts just for worthless reddit karma. Then, while looking over his comments for some sense that he's not wasting his time, he finds a tip. He learns more; he sets up a wallet; he begins putting a bitcoin address on his work; he starts receiving money; he advertises his skills, and produces graphic art for startups, completely over the Internet, trading bitcoins for art. He uses the money he's earned to buy his girlfriend the ring that she's always wanted, but has always been too expensive, and proposes to her.
It's BULLSHIT, but done right, it could be inspiring.

**Bitcoin has NEVER BEEN democratic. It's Capitalistic.**
In a democracy, every entity's vote carries the same weight as every other entity's vote; this is not the case in the Bitcoin system, which instead does exactly what the *majority-holders* of assets say to do.
The more assets you control (i.e., the more important your mining infrastructure, etc.), the more important your vote is.
This is good, because it means that the system at any given time is most likely to be maintained by those who will appropriate resources well (as long as there's a free market); **so, the only important question is whether there is a free market.**
Under Bitcoin, the landowners are the voters, and the more land one owns, the more important one's vote is. You are probably not a landowner—but that just means your vote would probably be stupid anyway (at least under a free market), so that's quite all right.
More to the point: There is no voting in the Bitcoin system; rather, people just *do* whatever they can get away with doing, and from their doings emerges the Bitcoin system.

The Bitcoin blockchain is just data. The network effect is not so much that a bunch of nodes are running Bitcoin software, but rather that a bunch of people have data tied to the history recorded by the Bitcoin blockchain.
Keep the same history, but update the software, and do so in such a way that bitcoin value can be used in the same way as ether, and that's all you need.
Why should I have to pay bitcoin to get ether to run distributed programs? Just cut out the middleman, and design the software to connect Bitcoin history into a bitcoin-based Etherium-like future.

Of course they did. The first successful variant was which did transactions directly on the blockchain. It was far too expensive, particularly at the time, to make small tips, because the damn transaction fee was a killer.
It was also difficult to make lots of quick tips, because it's not practical to build new transactions on top of uncomfirmed or poorly confirmed transactions; all sorts of madness did occur, and probably would still occur.


Again, you're not considering how easy and unholy it is to create unconfirmed transaction on top of unconfirmed transaction. Not only is it unwieldy, but it's expensive. It doesn't work; it's a definite failure.

Isn't that what pretty much all humans already do? Counterfeiting is a thing. In theory, the possibility of counterfeit notes makes the whole idea a complete farce; in practice, however, such currency seems to work pretty damn well.


Payments can already be pretty near instant: Again, while in theory, it's unsafe to accept a 5-confirmations transaction—let alone a zero-confirmation transaction—in practice, however, we find that it's almost always safe; fraud can be accounted for as the cost of business, as with the counterfeit notes of today.
The *real* problem is transaction malleability, because it currently renders fast turnover (rapid transactions) pretty much impossible.

It has everything to do with government paying debt. Only the federal government can *coin* money (not *print* money, mind you) and regulate its value, and the States can only make gold and silver Coin tender by law.
**The meaning of this is clear:**
* Payments by and to what were meant to be the most important governments in the land (the States) can only be legally required as (that is forced to be) gold and silver.
* The federal government was the sole entity that got to decide what constitutes U.S. coins, which were meant to be the main currency and therefore would have to be gold and silver, as the states could only make them legal tender if they were gold and silver.
The unfortunate outcome of all this is, of course, also clear: The federal government slowly accrued power until it became the most powerful government of the land, and then it started abusing its power to regulate the value of U.S coins in order to debase them for the federal government's own gains.
By decoupling U.S. money entirely from gold and silver, the States are breaking constitutional law by making U.S. money legal tender.

That means risky investments.
More than likely, your assertion is not true, anyway; if a business has so much dollar capital that the business doesn't know what to do with it, then the business would simply lock in its value by purchasing non-dollar assets in tax-havens.
Inflation only affects those who are not well connected financially—the median individual—and in that case, it's simply a hidden tax, transferring purchasing power from them to the government, an organization that will in turn make ludicrously poor investment decisions of its own, thereby just trashing the world's wealth.

Bitcoin has few ordinary people using it today, and probably won't have many more for some years to come.
Most people who use Bitcoin are not directly contributing mining power, and never will.
The new network will be much weaker at first, as ordinary people slowly adapt, if at all.

Why? If the economic activity is accounted for in bitcoins, then the value of a bitcoin would reflect the productivity of the economy:
* The more productive an economy becomes, the fewer bitcoins it takes to achieve something; price deflation means the economy is doing well.
* The less productive an economy becomes, the more bitcoins it takes to achieve something; price inflation means the economy is doing poorly.
    In this scenario, investors will find many other investments much more profitable than merely holding onto bitcoin, thereby jump-starting the economy again.
In this way, a "deflationary" currency makes for shrewd investors.

In a decentralized network, centralization will always occur where some efficiency is at a premium. However, when a centralization phenomenon begins acting "badly", the network will perceive this as damage and route around it, probably to form another version of the centralization.
These taxes, rules, and regulations are such damage; for instance, people will just stop converting their bitcoin to local currency, choosing instead to use bitcoins directly. Black markets will flourish, etc., until regulators are ignored out of existence.

The powers that be have established a system that induces spending, but only as a *byproduct* of the actual purpose of the system: To transfer purchasing power to the government from every holder of the currency; that is, to levy a silent tax that requires no public discussion or vote.


Only through cronyism, in which the force of government is used by cronies to coerce resources from everybody else.
Look, under a free market, capital that is *well invested* is rewarded with more capital—that is, it is rewarded with [the right to make more investment decisions]( this makes *perfect* sense, and is exactly as it should be.

I wouldn't mind printing information (official or otherwise) about, say, the point-of-sale services provided by Coinbase and Bitpay, and then handing it out politely to the every-day businesses that I frequent. However, I cannot help but think to myself:
* *"Why should I? They wouldn't be paying me anything for the effort!"*
**So, here's the plan:** *Pay me for the effort*, Coinbase and Bitpay. Start a promotional campaign, where a "promotional code" is simply any bitcoin address; your new customer can enter that "promotional code" in order to receive some kind of extra benefit, and in doing so, will trigger a "finders" reward be sent to that bitcoin address.
Perhaps it would be a good idea if you allowed a person to register a bitcoin address in return for an associated, shorter string of text that can serve as the promotional code.
Now, I realize this is not a perfect plan—the rewards might not be paid, or a clever business owner could just collect *both* the promotional benefit *and* the finder's reward. However, no matter what happens:
* You gain lots of willing helpers.

* &gt; it doesn't matter who earned what&amp;hellip; all that matters is % consumption of the marginal dollar and its turnover
    All that matters is whether or not resources are appropriated well. You want to take the power of appropriation from productive hands, and put it into unproducive hands. It's completely ludicrous. In particular:
    &gt; welfare spurs economic activity more than tax breaks.
    **That economic activity is not necessarily optimal or even good.**
* &gt; what would happen if everyone&amp;hellip; saved as much wealth as they could, only spending what was necessary for food, shelter and clothing.
    If you're saving as much wealth as you can, then you'll naturally identify overheads and make corrections and improvements. That is, you will *invest*.
    You're trying to create a fantastical scenario where there is no investment, but that's an impossible scenario—you've based your analysis on a contradiction: Saving as much as possible, but no investment.
    Even more comically, you're suggesting that an overhead is—in general—benificial:
    &gt;  inflation encourages spending because holding money is a guaranteed loss in purchase power
    **But, again, that spending is not necessarily optimal or even good.**
    In particular, where do you think that lost purchasing power goes? It doesn't just disappear; rather, it is tranferred from holders of the currency to the authorities who set inflationary policy (the government). Yet, what is your indication that government is a good appropriator of that wealth? After all, the bureaucrats who would use that stolen purchasing power are not the ones who were clever enough to have made it in the first place—once again, you want to take the power of appropriation from productive hands, and put it into unproducive hands. It's completely ludicrous.
    Do you think that increasing taxation during a recession will stimulate the economy? Well, inflationary policy is taxation: It is a transfer of purchasing power from everyone who holds the currency to the government.
* &gt; deflation encourages hoarding because money will only appreciate in value.
    What is wrong with an appreciating value? What do you think causes an appreciating value?
    If a currency is experiencing appreciating value, that is either caused by over-production or an increase in productivity.
    * In the case of over-production, deflation serves as a sign for malinvestment: Deflation helps discover overheads.
    * In the case of an increase in productivity, deflation serves as a sign that there is good investment going on.
    In contrast, inflationary policy props up the over-production *and* transfers that extra productivity into the *incapable* hands of unproductive bureaucrats.
    Thus, in both cases, deflation is a better carrot and stick for inducing ***good*** investment; you lose at your own game.
* &gt; the problem with deflationary currency is that it necessitates investment opportunities to be that much more lucrative, by out pacing deflation, to attract anyone.
    Then people will just wait until deflation slows enough—that is, when over-production has been brought under control, and productivity has begun to stagnate. Again, deflation is the signal for what and when investment is a good idea.
* &gt;  the deflation-prone nature of bitcoin will result in wealth condensation
    So what?

That's why the rest of us have chosen a theory that embraces the existence of corrupt, self-interested—and, indeed, *incompetent*—actors rather than a theory which pretends they don't exist.


[Your link]( expresses the crux of each side's argument:
* "deflation can be thought of as an effective increase in a loan's interest rate"
* "inflation, whose effect is to tax currency holders and lenders (savers) and use the proceeds to subsidize borrowers, including governments, and to cause malinvestment as overinvestment."
Thus, deflation hurts when a society is living beyond its means, a situation this is often caused by an initial destruction of wealth:
* Governments' **inflationary policies** lead to malinvestment that destroys wealth.
* In the case of post-WW2 Europe, governments had murdered populations, disrupted intellectual infrastructure, blew up whole cities, and converted productive industries into over-producers of war stuffs.
When the dust settles, the people who have nothing left take loans in order to live as they once had—a lifestyle that is *now* beyond their means due to the destruction of wealth.
The governments' solution? Redistribute the wealth by force: Tax those who have some wealth (through silent inflationary policy) and basically hand it out to those who don't have wealth—and, while destroying particular individuals' wealth, if they're not careful, they might end up pretty much destroying *everybody's* wealth (as with the Weimar Republic).

A ~~\[modern\]~~ [Bitcoin address]( is *not* a public key; it is the hash of a hash of a public key, with a checksum and version number attached.

Just imagine that you come across a large grocery store that has never heard of credit/debit cards. How would you feel telling them about that system?
Now, the next time that you're going to talk about bitcoin, **just tap into that same feeling first.**
I wouldn't mind printing information (official or otherwise) about, say, the point-of-sale services provided by Coinbase and Bitpay, and then handing it out politely to the every-day businesses that I frequent. However, I cannot help but think to myself:
* *"Why should I? They wouldn't be paying me anything for the effort!"*
**So, here's the plan:** *Pay me for the effort*, Coinbase and Bitpay. Start a promotional campaign, where a "promotional code" is simply any bitcoin address; your new customer can enter that "promotional code" in order to receive some kind of extra benefit, and in doing so, will trigger a "finders" reward be sent to that bitcoin address.
Perhaps it would be a good idea if you allowed a person to register a bitcoin address in return for an associated, shorter string of text that can serve as the promotional code.
Now, I realize this is not a perfect plan—the rewards might not be paid, or a clever business owner could just collect *both* the promotional benefit *and* the finder's reward. However, no matter what happens:
* You gain lots of willing helpers.
* You gain new customers.

You are being confused by the word "vote".
Bitcoin is NOT democratic. It's Capitalistic.
In a democracy, every entity's vote carries the same weight as every other entity's vote; this is not the case in the Bitcoin system, which instead does exactly what the *majority-holders* of assets say to do.
The more assets you control (i.e., the more important your mining infrastructure, etc.), the more important your vote is.
This is good, because it means that the system at any given time is most likely to be maintained by those who will appropriate resources well (as long as there's a free market).
Under Bitcoin, the landowners are the voters, and the more land one owns, the more important one's vote is. You are probably not a landowner—but that just means your vote would probably be stupid anyway (at least under a free market), so that's quite all right.
More to the point: There is no voting in the Bitcoin system; rather, people just *do* whatever they can get away with doing, and from their doings emerges the Bitcoin system.

It's not an aspect of Bitcoin, per se, but rather an aspect of many Bitcoin clients.
That being said, it is a good feature. Once you spend the coins associated with one address, an important number called a 'public key' is exposed to the world; this shouldn't matter in the near term, but when devices called Quantum Computers become functional, they will be so computationally powerful that they will be able to derive the secret 'private key' that is associated with that 'public key', and that 'private key' can be used to spend coins that were sent to that same address.
So, it's best not to keep using that same address after the coins associated with it have been spent. Moreover, reusing the same address allows attackers to identify you and the people you pay more easily.
This is why a Bitcoin client creates a *pool* of precomputed addresses (and private keys), so that when you back up your wallet, you're backing up those precomputed addresses that it will use automatically.
So, here are your choices:
0. Give up a great deal of cryptographic security by using a client that will send the balance back to the original address.
1. Save your paper wallet with the extra addresses (actually, with the extra private keys from which those addresses are derived) that are used for such balance.
You can simplify the latter solution by using private keys (and therefore addresses) that are computed from a 'seed' (i.e., a special piece of data such as a password), so that you only need to back up (i.e., *print*) that seed as your paper wallet, and then software can derive any possible private keys (and their associated addresses) from that seed.

Reusing the same address is wrongheaded.
* Clearing it will not hide how much money has gone through it.
* You shouldn't want your information to be so public. It reveals information about not only you, but also potentially about others with whom you've interacted.
* It's cryptographically unsound.
    There are known quantum-computing algorithms for breaking exactly the cryptography used by Bitcoin—*if the public key is known* (however, there are **not** necessarily known quantum computing algorithms for, say, deriving a seed or figuring out a key based on a hash).
    A [Bitcoin address]( is *not* a public key; it is the hash of a hash of a public key, with a checksum and version number attached.
    This address reveals not much about the public key itself, but when you use the private key to sign a transaction (i.e., to send coins to some other address), the public key itself is exposed, which opens up the associated private key to [an attack via Shor's algorithm]( **This is why you should never reuse address after spending the coins associated with it.**

I really can't speak for how multibit or blockchain.info stores its data, except to say that each Bitcoin address is associated with \[at least\] one private key; unless you're doing something fancy, each Bitcoin address is associated with *exactly* one private key. So, for each Bitcoin address that is meaningful to you, back up that Bitcoin address's associated private key, and you'll be fine.
I'm guessing that backing up the `wallet.dat` backs up everything already, but there's nothing wrong with getting your hands on particular private keys as well; multibit will be able to read that `wallet.dat` directly, no doubt, but the private keys themselves are what matter—if you feel comfortable with a backup of that `wallet.dat` file, then great, but it's just as reasonable to store those private keys in a way that you yourself can easily read and type.
I suggest trying to import into multibit (or any other such piece of software) what you think are the relevant private keys in order to see whether you are creating proper backups of the private keys. If you ever feel that your private keys may have been compromised in doing this, then please transfer the coins to a new address, and then back up the private key associated with that new address.

Wealth can either be squandered or put to productive use. This is all that matters.

* &gt;  For example, take welfare versus tax breaks
    Welfare is giving people wealth they did not earn. Tax breaks are allowing people to *keep* the wealth that they *did* earn. This is an important distinction; one puts resources under the control of likely productive people, while the other puts resources under the control of likely unproductive people.
* &gt;  The latter are considered a less efficient allocation of potential government revenue
    According to whom? I think it's a more efficient allocation for Elon Musk to spend his money buying a ticket on Richard Branson's suborbital thrill-ride technology (or for Richard to spend his money on Musk's electric-car technology) than it is for Shaniqua to buy twizzlers to "feed" her 5 illiterate children.
* &gt; If you can hoard bitcoins it does discourage spending but what's bad about that is that it discourages the application of capital to production.
    Production of *what?* Twizzlers for all the world's Shaniquas and their illiterate children?
    Deflation is either caused by over-production or an increase in productivity. Inflationary policy will both prop up the over-production *and* steal that extra productivity in order to squander it on Shaniqua or on, say, war mongering.
    In short: When a currency is in deflation, either the economy is already improving, or investments are guaranteed to be shrewder.
* &gt; If someone locks all their money up into gold or bitcoin that doesn't take it out of the economy - it transfers those resources to someone else who may or may not spend it.
    You are making the disastrously fallacious equivalence between fiat currency and wealth; they are *not* the same.
    Put another way: That gold is now taken out of the economy. Also, when it turns out that the purchaser really needs food stuffs, all he'll have is a bunch of pretty looking metal—a malinvestment.

The only thing that requires 'hardware' (i.e., access to the Internet) is *verification* of ownership; you can freely trade the data that is used in that verification process, especially if you already trust that the data has not been compromised.

* &gt; "Can this be dumbed down just a tiny bit so I can comprehend it?"
    The Big O notation here is really only useful as a comparison to the Big O notation of the classical (that is, "non-quantum") factorization algorithm; when you compare them, you see that a quantum computer is *wildly* faster: If a quantum computer takes a century to factor a 256-bit number, then a classical computer will take upwards of 13559132 centuries to do the same thing.
    Of course, if it still takes a century to break, then who cares? I don't know enough about quantum computing to give you a feeling for how long it would take in terms of wall-clock time to derive the private key. How long it takes to complete factorization is dependent on how fast the implementation is, in that a quad-core x86_64 system with a GPGPU will run a particular algorithm much faster than a Pentium III system could; nobody would have believed how fast classical computers have become either&amp;hellip;
* &gt; any company accepting Bitcoins cannot safely maintain a single "RECIPIENT" address which they then forward to sub-wallets or accounts (which I had hitherto assumed would be a possibility)&amp;hellip;
    Well, this is why the official Bitcoin client software (at least) tends to deal with bitcoins in terms of "accounts" rather than addresses; the concept of an address should probably be considered a low-level implementation detail to be hidden away under such higher-level, user-friendly abstractions.
    Consider also the fact that when you spend only some of the bitcoins associated with a particular address, the official client sends the leftover coins to another address (the "change address"); this is because you shouldn't reuse the same address again. Unfortunately, this *high-level* behavior has bitten quite a number of people who make assumptions based solely on *low-level* concepts like bitcoin addresses.
* &gt; So setting up a button for a "Donations" address on a web-page would only be useful until you wanted to use any of its accumulated balance, at which point the button's address needs updating.
    Yes, this is true.
    However, it's good to change the address for *every* transaction anyway, not only so that you can protect your own activity, but so that you don't make it easy for snoops to datamine the blockchain for relationships that involve others.
While there are seemingly scary complexities, just keep in mind that they affect everyone, so elegant, foolproof higher-level constructs will eventually abound.
@_date: 2013-06-03 15:56:50
What in the world does that have to do with *anything*? That's a problem for the *buyer*, not the *seller*, and it's a problem that is not even specific to bitcoins, let alone zero-confirmation transactions.
I recall an experience a while back of someone buying some headphones off craigslist using dollars.
They met up at a fast food joint, buyer looked them over, decided they were good, handed over $80, and then the seller stood up and walked off with the headphones. A brief confrontation followed, wherein the seller said "What? I said I wanted bitcoins, and you didn't want to pay it, so I'm walking."

    Similarly, the word "physical" makes no sense to me. What does that even mean? The Bitcoin network is certainly backed by computing machines and the physical laws of the universe.
* A little bit later:
    &gt; a transaction is a cryptographically signed transfer of funds from one public key to another.
