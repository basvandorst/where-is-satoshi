Also, credit card companies charge you between 10% and 39.99% APR interest depending on their fine print. So really, no, I'm not.

What percentage fee do you charge above spot? Also is there a fixed fee alongside the percentage fee?

Hey this is my machine :D You dont have to scan your fingerprints, that option is disabled. And you only need to scan your ID and take a photo if you are buying over $3,000.
The fee is 12.5%, there are a lot of costs associated with running a business like this (Mall rent, bank fees, exchange fees, wifi hotspot and service, maintenance, cash collection service, manufacturer takes a percent, etc etc). I wholly recommend people to use cash app or coinbase to buy. This is for people who are not aware of this space and dont know how to get in and want to get their feet wet.

Do not cancel if the payment is pending. If you cancel the seller gets their funds back and they don't have to send it to you.

I'm a batmtwo operator, feel free to message me with any questions

You are going to find difficulty finding ones that dont record any data on you. As an operator myself the regulations and laws we have to follow are pretty ridiculous.
