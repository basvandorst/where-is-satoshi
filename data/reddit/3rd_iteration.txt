BTCRecover doesn't currently support using a GPU for BIP39 wallets and hasn't really been updated since Dec 2017 (with the exception of the segwit support in the fork I linked). My plan is to stick to what is doable for folk at home with current open source tools and offer estimates is what a GPU or FPGA could pull off. (Let's assume someone has a proprietary solution that uses those and can perform at least 10-100x better that a top end cpu, so they are worth considering from a security perspective)
If you are aware of similar tools that support using a GPU I would love to include real world tests of those too as I have a 1080ti to throw at it :)

Remember folks... Your hardware wallets, papers wallets, etc, shouldn't come with pre-made private keys, PIN's or scratch off recovery cards! (Even if they have been made to look legit)
Always generate your own keys, seed phrases, etc :)

No worries, can be relied on to give this type of feedback, so happy to improve it and make it better for everyone. :)
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:44:42
It's a similar process :)

Great thinking, done :)

1) Watch out for scams. A bunch of examples here: 
2) If you are 100% newbie, stick with coinbase to avoid purchasing scam stuff and leave your crypto there until you have a better grasp on how crypto wallets work.

Yea you are right that there are a small number who have (so far) shown to be trustworthy, the issue I see is that it's only a matter of time before dodgy people start selling lookalikes of the otherwise legit collectables. (And most folk, especially those new to the space aren't likely to be able to tell them apart)

The pin is just to secure the device, so that is different to a passphrase.
In terms of someone finding your 24 word seed, BIP39 passphrase will provide protection against that. (Which may be more or less applicable depending on how you store your seed backups)
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:50:30
Yep, they call them hidden wallets.
Guide here:
The only point to note that I would offer with Ledger is that while having a passphrase connected to a 2nd PIN is very convenient, it also means that it is easier to forget because you aren't entering it all the time. This isn't an issue in itself, just means that you should make sure you have a backup of some kind.

If you don't need a step by step guide and explainer, you can find some earlier draft notes about it here: 
My plan is to spin it up on a 48 core server too (basically up see what $100 of server time would let you run in terms of complexity, then extrapolate to work out what $1000 could achieve), I'm just really interested to see how high end "consumer" grade stuff goes.

I did those tests in the previous video and used the results of this as the basis for the calculations at the end of the video. The previous video is this one 
Having had contact with dozens of people who have botched their passphrase through my channel over the last few months, I am now **very strongly biased** towards having robust backups and having a well thought out word-set really helps with this... If you have some mechanism whereby a single typo won't make you lose everything then you can ignore this, I just don't want to be encouraging viewers to be picking crazy long and random passphrases that they will mess up. 
In terms of diceware... (I am assuming the short list here)
Basically 3 words with a dictionary (potential wordlist) 500 long will take ~3 days on a 48 core server, so you can extrapolate from there. Basically, the length of time it takes to successfully attack increases exponentially as you increase the wordlist. (eg: using 3 words off a 600 word list would take 6 days, 3 words for 700 would take 9, 3 words for a 1000 word list would take 10, 3 words off the diceware short would take 20) It also increases exponentially as you add words based on the size of the dictionary, so if you have a 3 words taking 20 days with a list of 1228, 4 words would take 20x1288=25760 days, 5 words 25760*1288=33 million days, etc. (Note that this length of time is for a complete run, meaning that there is a 10% chance the passphrase would be found after 10% of this time, etc, so people need to decide for themselves what probability and timeframe they are comfortable with)
I included a GPU factor of 10 and an ASIC factor of 1000 effeciency gains in the video, both to be safe and to automatically factor in Moores law, so on a theoretical Asic, this 33 million days is cut down to a mere 10 years ;)

Using some dice and the diceware short list with half a dozen words is a great place to start.

Request from 3 people is enough, so will add a 30 second but clip about that and replace the video later today, should have a 1.1 video uploade in about 12 hours. :)

I understand the sentiment but I don't think it is helpful for the community to respond to folks getting scammed with "you deserved it". (Especially when there are people who have though out how best to exploit them)
The learning curve in crypto is very steep and it isn't at all forgiving if you make a mistake.
@_date: 2019-07-27 12:13:14
Don't try this, it's a terrible idea.
@_date: 2019-07-30 21:30:56
Thanks for the feedback.
I did think about that aspect of things, but If people download the maintainers key from electrum.org once, then it will be keep you safe for all future downloads too. (The video will also age better)
 Can add a short extra with the Sig itself and re-upload the video if enough people feel it is a critical oversight.
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:11:46
So for those following along....
Spun up a 48 core Linode and yea, it scales very well.

Part of it is to help people see, in a really practical way, how different passphrase selections impact security as well as providing potential tools for people to use in the situation where they are trying to recover from a typo or half remembered passphrase. (Especially good way to demonstrate that assuming a particular rig can offer 10x performance isn't unrealistic, meaning that a recovery that will take 12 months in their potato laptop can be done in under a month on high end hardware using the same tools)
It also helps people to understand wordlists that they should check before sassuming their passphrase is secure. (Eg: the rockyou list) simply put, it is a simple way to demonstrate that people should assume that tools to break a passphrase are readily available.
The other thing it illustrates to people is that just because it will take say, 1 month to run a  exhaustive test, there is a 50% chance that it will be found within 2 weeks...

Can you post a transcript so others know who to avoid

If you are an Electrum user, it's a great reason to upgrade to a safe version (as to avoid getting phished like in here:  at the same time.

Yea I guess the challenge for me is that I am not confident in my ability to spot a fake in this particular example, let alone encourage someone else to think they can, so I would rather be conservative and have them trust the math. ;) 
(Or at least understand the risks as to be able to make an informed decision)
For all my videos where I am offering advice, I am tending to err on the side of "tinfoil hat" :)

Were you using a PC in a managed environment, school, work or shared? (Including one that other people in your house have access to?)
The reason I ask is that someone with control of your network and access to your PC can easily phish you, even with a bookmarked url as demonstrated here: 
@_date: 2019-06-29 10:52:35
Bip39.info it has some extra code at the end that immediately sends the 24 word seed + passphrase to the site creator. (Doesn't matter whether it is accessed via http or https, same behaviour)
I've reported it to a few services and it's webhost, so hopefully it disappears before it scams too many more newbies.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:55:50
I believe you should just be able to run the script in the terminal and it will give you a private key that you can in import into electerum.
Just don't post the private keys on here :)
@_date: 2019-06-30 09:36:50
I reported it pretty far and wide yesterday...
Got replies from a few lists that it has been accepted as malicious and my ISP here in Australia has now blocked it too. (Didn't report to them, so they must have pulled it from one of the other lists.)
Time to report the new one too...
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:29:33
Looks like it is possible 
You can just export a single private key for a BTC address from your hardware wallet seed (in an air gapped clean environment like TAILS) and go from there.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:40:19
If you get it working, I would suggest posting back here as others are likely to have the same issue and want find the info helpful.
Secondly, if you get it working and the keys are old, you will also have Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold waiting for you to claim. The Bitcoin Cash would be easy and you can just import the same private keys into Electron-Cash.
The main catch with claiming these altcoins is that they share the same private keys as your main BTC, so a client that can access them can potentially expose your BTC to be stolen. (As happened with Bitcoin Gold) As such it is best to move the BTC to a new wallet before trying to claim them, unless you have a hardware wallet/software wallet that natively supports splitting already. (And since you are manually recovering from coinkite, you aren't)
The best process would be:
1. Regain access to BTC, transfer to a new wallet. (Ledger Nano, Trezor, etc, Coinomi at a pinch if you are on Android and not rooted)
2. Claim Bitcoin Cash, then transfer this to a new wallet.
3. Claim Bitcoin Gold

I had a bit of a Ledger fail that sidelined a bunch of my BCH, basically a bug that has transactions sit in the client as unconfirmed but they don't ever appear in the mempool, let alone blocks...
Hitting Ledger support can get it fixed for plump round 2 over the next few days.

Info on how to run it on Mac is here.
Don't send it to anyone either...
@_date: 2016-02-05 23:10:27
I have one of these and it is great, small enough to just live in my physical wallet and cheap enough that it isn't a big deal if it gets lost/broken.
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:29:14
Because 2+2=4...
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:43:34
Because good security can be fun too :)
