Because people don't like opposing opinions.

We will just have to see what Lambrozo meant about attacking Segwit2x both technically and legally.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:23:16
That's what I'm saying. What is this I hear about a 50% spike?
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:55:05
Except the patent is for all side-chains.

My comment karma was from the 2016 election when I posted support of a candidate that a bunch of people from that sub didn't like. It has nothing to do with anything other than that I had a different opinion than other people in the same sub. It wasn't in Bitcoin, FYI. I don't post much. Only when I have real concerns or feel strongly about something.

I'm a bit new to this. What do you mean shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:36:43
What's bcash?
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:00:56
LOL. Yeah, I should just do whatever everyone else thinks is right, rather than think for myself. Good advice.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:46:42
Not an explanation of patents on side-chains.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:50:10
So Core has said many times that the only real solution to scaling is side-chains like LN, right? So owning a patent on side-chains, and it being the only real solution to scaling is somehow not a problem? You don't see any ulterior motives here with Segregated Witness?
LN is going to have to get Blockstream's permission (i.e. license) before they can use it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:47:22
So this means we need Blockstream's permission to operate a side-chain? And that is not a problem, in your eyes?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:23:27
What is all the chatter about it then?
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:05:30
No, I am addressing the exact issue raised by this patent. I want some reassurance that we haven't been hoodwinked.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:45:30
How do I get in on that? 30% in one day sounds fun (and risky).
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:02:03
The abstract appears to outline a blanket patent on pegged sidechains.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:25:03
It was on YouTube. I can't find the video. I watch so many every day.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:59:50
Read the text. Tell me I'm wrong that this covers all (pegged) side-chains.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:02:16
It says something about Blockstream's motives.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:54:49
This is a blanket patent on all side-chains. Look at the abstract.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:56:56
Oh I understand the free market. I also understand that it seems Core's true motives are less than altruistic, based on this patent. I thought the problem with ASICBoost was its patent. Isn't that true?
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:53:03
Yikes. That's your real answer?
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:58:50
By the way... if fees are $5 or more, you will HAVE TO use a side-chain to transact in Bitcoin... thus, falling under Blockstream's patent.
This is not what Bitcoin is about. Bitcoin is about freedom. This is slavery.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:07:24
I didn't say I have a problem with ASICBoost. I am saying that Core and everyone here seems to have a problem with ASICBoost because it's patented... to the point of disabling it in the Core client. So why is it okay to patent side-chains, but not to patent mining hardware?
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:00:17
LOL @ all you idiots in here. The wallet is in no way deceptive. It creates a Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash wallet. I think you all need to take a deep, hard look at the coin you're supporting. What gives it value now that it has no utility?
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:30:41
It creates both. It's only deceptive if you are mentally challenged.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:19:33
Guys, have you actually tried the wallet? It is actually very awesome. You can keep Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in it side by side all in one wallet. If you send Bitcoin to a Bitcoin Cash address or vice-versa, it will receive it on the whatever chain it comes in on. You won't lose your money sending TO this wallet. Sending FROM it, you will have to be more careful. It is actually pretty awesome though. You all should really check it out.

Lack of consensus didn't stop Segwit. Re: UASF.
