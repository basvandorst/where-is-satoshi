Yes, but employees also shouldn't be entitled to anything the company isn't willing to give just because they called big daddy law on them. Netflix isn't entitled to have you as a subscriber to their service, and you aren't entitled to have a company as yours.

A lot of those things are patently illegal now and not because of unions while all of those things changed because the economics of our marketplace changed.
We were where China is now. People work those jobs to try and get ahead. Once they have in-demand skills and education (courtesy of their industrious parents working those jobs), they suddenly get pickier and also stop sending their kids to work.
The economic evolution of a country is a difficult but natural thing. Would you rather those kids starve, work hard labor on farms, or their parents work as prostitutes? That's what happens when these jobs don't exist, and those jobs have no reason to go to impoverished people and areas if they can't operate cheaply.
Doesn't mean they should do anything actually harmful (like pour toxic chemicals in rivers), but we also shouldn't force all of our standards arbitrarily on economies that aren't ready for it.

In normal companies - especially ones that rely on skilled labor - good employees are valuable. Unions are superfluous and do little more than create a second mammoth bureaucracy to deal with while also creating a distance and often animosity between management and employees. The pay is often extremely nice, but that comes at the expense of the company being less competitive and slowly losing market share until - likely - death by competition

Because people only like and steal in capitalist societies...

It's cool to be edgy and all, but if you're in to socialism, Venezuela is glad to have you. Capitalism has been the single most incredible force for improving the well-being and happiness of mankind

And your alternative breeds even greater corruption by centralizing both political and economic decision-making to the same body of human beings and furthermore only functions when local, emergent, capitalistic markets between groups and dissenting ideas are stamped out.

Breaking the contract you have made with your customer is not capitalism. That's specifically why it's illegal.

Hard to protect a culture when everyone's starving despite spending 12 hours per day farming but... Hey, you do you

Yes, I disagree so I must watch Fox News and be retarded. Get back to me when you read almost any piece of economic literature.

Krugman has always been an idiot, but acting like he doesn't understand what gives a currency value is epicly stupid for an economist

Which was wrong as per the many replies with clear and seemingly obvious reasons why it's wrong.
Despite its roots in game theory, economics is not about winners and losers, people.

Of course I feel special. I'm a 5-star man - a golden God - who hasn't even begun to peak.
You? You peaked. You peaked all over the place. Your body quit. Your bird quit. And it's no longer legit.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go boil some denim I found under a bridge.
