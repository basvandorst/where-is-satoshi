Please Explain your reasoning.

Ya Sure you do. Any reputable business would  have refunded him and avoided the bad press.The fact that you admit it here"but I am not going to pay you" speaks volumes.

Actually the machine we use does not record a print at all.Instead it uses a palm vein scanner(since the veins in our palm are unique to us)which is effectively a password to your account. The information that's gathered from the machine is in no way shared with any outside party to the network thus protecting the users privacy while still adhering to "KYC" &amp; "AML".

Because we are expanding in to other countries so it would not make sense to call it Global Bitcoin ATM UK Ltd.;P

You are absolutely correct! 658 visits in a couple hours is nothing, but boy did it produce some good results.

Haha Thats real funny!! Love it! But...didnt you bother to read this entire thread? The site there now is just a front cover for a rapidly growing startup and we felt that our energy had to be put else where...after all there was a hell of a lot to do to make this happen. The new site will be completed in Feb which will include every aspect of our business, an ATM locator and featured writeup of the venue along with a complete education centre for the not so savvy.

Please elaborate your concerns because we certainly dont see any.

Thanks for all the comments regarding GBA! We hope you lot are ready to see our machines bloom across the UK?

Hello Luxy_c,
JP is away at the minute so I will answer this for you. The machines cost the venue owner nothing at all. Apart from the media exposure and an increase in traffic the venue owner will also benefit from an agreed override, which would be discussed in private. Hope that helps:)

Actually the Logo on the machine is photo shopped until the machine hits the UK (Startup)and receives the GBA brand. If you have any doubts as to the legitimacy please contact Jordan K himself and he will tell you that they are in fact a real company and importing these ATMs and plan to bring many more in to the UK this year.
