As a general principle, if the login page isn't SSL-protected, client-side security is not an entirely satisfactory reassurance, since you don't know where the Javascript doing the security really came from.
If a company thinks it's fine to train their customers to enter passwords into unprotected pages, that company is not getting competent security guidance.  They're likely to have other security problems, too, that are less visible than their login page.

How can I be sure that the process by which the Trezor chooses my secret key is sufficiently random that Trezor's creators cannot find that key?  Even a small defect in the random-number process can easily reduce the search space from "unsearchably huge" to "easily searchable", and we users would have no way to detect it.

So the feds don't even have to waste NSA resources mounting a denial-of-service attack on Bitcoin, they can let parasites like these do it for them.

I complained to Coinbase about transactions being confirmed by unencrypted emails with precise amounts in the Subject lines.  It would be so easy to add an optional PGP public key to all the information they require during registration.  Coinbase responded with thanks for my feedback but no indication of interest.

You might already have a problem.  For many years now, anybody with US citizenship and more than $10K in overseas accounts (that's the total of all accounts) has been required to send the US Treasury, every year by June 15, a Form TD F 90-22.1 detailing every overseas account, failing which one is subject to fines of something like $10,000 plus 25% of the balance per account per year.  Last March, I encountered a poignant [account]( of a young Swedish woman with dual US citizenship who learned belatedly of this requirement, estimated her fine to be something over $1M, and assumed that if she were open and cooperative with the US authorities they would be reasonable and go easy on her.  At the time of publication, things didn't appear to be going well for her.
I can't help wondering whether London mayor and dual citizen Boris Johnson has been filing TD F 90-22.1's with the US Treasury.

Many thanks for the useful explanation.  I flunked one question on the quiz: I browsed to github.com, and found Peter Todd as a contributor to the Bitcoin project, and found a list of his contributions, but couldn't find anyplace exhibiting his key ID or a signature generated with his key.  Hints?

I'm glad to have Coinbase around, providing a convenient connection between the dollar world and the bitcoin world.  If the government comes along and tells them, "You have to ask these questions or we'll shut you down," I don't blame them for asking.  My "outgoing transfers" will be from me to me, and it won't trouble me at all to tell them that, and they'll be happy with that answer because it keeps the feds from nuking them and absolves them from responsibility for anything in the future of that bitcoin.  And maybe they'll be around the next time I need them.
It reminds me of once when my son got some kind of Tarzan injury, and I took him to our pediatrician, who was a personal friend, and she apologized that the government required her to ask something that amounted to "Did your parents do this to you?"  But she went on and asked.  Yeah, it would have been satisfying to see her thumb her nose at the Nanny State, and fight the glorious battle with strength and courage and blood flying everywhere, but she wanted to repair injured kids, not play Joan of Arc.  We continued friends.  I picture Coinbase being in that situation.

Don't forget that, as the recipient, you'll effectivly de-anonymize these payments if you aggregate them into a single bitcoin address, or spend them all at once.  The risk to the payer's privacy does not end with that payment.
@_date: 2015-05-02 05:52:42
I agree.  Your security rests entirely on (1) the private key's being a good random number, and (2) keeping the private key secret.  The process of converting the private key into a Bitcoin address is independent of the language in which it's implemented, so during that process there's no risk of Javascript being inferior to some other language.  And finally, if the programmer has done even a half-decent job of incorporating mouse movements into the private key, you have far more entropy than anybody can exhaustively search.
I have done what you're doing with bitcoinpaperwallet's generate-wallet.html, but just to avoid the possibility of someone trolling the blockchain for weak keys generated by an error in generate-wallet.html, I asked a Javascript-literate friend to add some hard-coded randomness to the process.  After the lines
    for (i = 0; i &lt; ba.length; ++i)
        ba[i] = sr.getByte() ^ rvBytes[i];
he added the lines
    for (i = 0; i &lt; ba.length; ++i)
        ba[i] ^= FIXED_RANDOMNESS[i % FIXED_RANDOMNESS.length];
where FIXED_RANDOMNESS was previously defined as 
    var FIXED_RANDOMNESS = [... random small integers ...]
Since then, I have found it more convenient to use this simple Python program:
    from pybitcointools import sha256, privtoaddr, encode_privkey
    x = raw_input("Type many random characters: ")
    state = sha256(x+"&lt;insert a bunch of random keystrokes here&gt;")
    for i in range(20):
       state = sha256(state+x)
       priv = sha256(state)
       addr = privtoaddr(priv)
       print("
Addr: {0}".format(addr))
       print("Priv: {0}".format(priv))
       print("Wif:  {0}".format(encode_privkey(priv, "wif")))

Find a friend who uses bitcoin, and ask him or her to make the donation for you.  Honestly, if you have no interest in bitcoin, learning enough to do it yourself would take more time than you're willing to spend.

It's a trick!  If I post a Bitcoin address here, what's to stop a bunch of spammers from sending stuff to it?   :-)

Delightful story.  More details from the [Buenos Aires Herald](

If the address has been used before, then you must assume that the previous user knows the private key, and so can spend any value that shows up at that address.
It is, of course, vastly improbable that proper wallet implementations will generate address collisions; but it is not at all improbable that flawed wallet implementations will.  How did you generate this address?

This "security improvement" also derailed me for a while, but eventually I got past it, and maybe you can, too.
I ended up installing Authy on the computer I use for browsing to Coinbase.  I'm sorry I can't remember all the details of the thrashing around, but ultimately Authy seemed content to verify my identity by calling me on the landline number I had registered with Coinbase, and after that Coinbase was content to accept Authy's authentication of me.
@_date: 2016-11-11 20:19:18
Similarly, the account to which I lost access had no link to Authy.  Nevertheless, by installing Authy I regained access to the account.

If I may try to put a less incendiary tone on this conversation, Coinbase is trying (I think sincerely) to do several complex and difficult things, including complying with inscrutable rules that Washington, DC, imposes on financial companies while keeping a very secure web interface.  Your relations with Coinbase are likely to have some uncomfortable moments, possibly including periods when you wonder what will happen if you can't ever log in again, as is happining to another person who posted to this subreddit today.
Accordingly, if you're just looking for a wallet -- a place to store bitcoin -- then Coinbase is not an appropriate vehicle.  On the other hand, if you want to buy or sell bitcoin, then Coinbase might work for you, but you might want to avoid ever being in the situation of having too many eggs in that particular basket.

What Yelowitz and Wilson are reporting is that among the Google Trends statewide aggregates for seven states, there are detectable correlations between fluctuations in interest in Bitcoin and fluctuations in interest in Silk Road.  This is laughably thin evidence for the propsition that Bitcoin interest is driven by illegal activity.  Similarly, the supposed lack of investment interest is evidenced only by the absence of a correlation with search tallies for the phrase "make money" -- as if Yelowitz and Wilson imagine the Winklevoss twins alternating between Google searches for "What is Bitcoin" and "How to make money".
TLDR: Yelowitz and Wilson report amusing correlations, but their results are being wildly overinterpreted.

Here's where the above comment *should* answer your question:


I can't help noticing that this doesn't make sense.  My best guess (warning: I'm pretty ignorant here) is that people concerned (possibly quite legitimately) about centralization want to hold the obviously necessary blocksize increase hostage in order to get some separate centralization-counteracting features accepted.

And when you're deciding whether a character "has seen sufficient use IN TEXT to warrant a code point," bear in mind that Unicode has a Pile Of Poo symbol, U+1F4A9.
Could anyone reasonably exclude a Bitcoin B from a standard that has a Pile Of Poo symbol?

An attacker wouldn't attack a specific address or wallet.  The logical attack strategy is to generate a huge table of addresses derived from simple passwords, then watch Bitcoin traffic for deposits into any address in the table.  When any value is transferred to any address in the table, look up the key in the table and grab it.

Wonderful.  You solved my problem.  Many thanks.  What became of the Reddit bitcoin trick where I could buy you a beer?
For the benefit of any similarly bewildered person who googles his way to this thread,
* Running the Chrome browser on my laptop, I installed the Authy extension.
* Configuring Authy, I gave it my landline number, and asked for voice authentication.
* A window popped up on my laptop saying the magic number is 69.
* The phone rang, and I answered and, when instructed, entered 69 on the phone's keypad.
* A window appeared on my laptop containing an icon for Coinbase.  (I'm baffled how this happened.  I hadn't started logging in to Coinbase yet.)
* I clicked on the Coinbase icon, and a window appeared with a 6-digit number that changed about every 20 seconds.
* I then logged in at Coinbase.  Whenever Coinbase wanted authentication for something, like logging in or changing my security settings, a pop-up window would appear, into which I would copy-and-paste the magic 6-digit number currently displayed in the Authy window.

An understandable urge, but as you squeeze in more things, the added things will be less and less universally popular, and acceptance will suffer.  Recent examples of this phenomenon include IPv6, Unicode, and Python 3.

I admit, it hadn't occurred to me that there might be an r/coinbase.  So I just now trotted over there, and the most recent post seems to be 7 months old.  If my purpose were just to register a complaint, I guess that would be fine, but I'm really hoping to get some helpful advice.

My wife and her Swedish sister, both intelligent people and professional engineers, recently attempted an ordinary bank transfer from a Swedish bank to a US bank.   After about a half-hour of discussion with bankers to make sure all the Mystical Bank Transfer Numbers were right, they said Go, and the money disappeared from the Swedish account, and hasn't been seen since.   Even if the money reappears, the hours spent on the phone trying to get the process started and then get the problem fixed make Bitcoin look ridiculously easy.

For the best peace of mind, before you type a password into a web page, make sure that the connection is secure (https, not http), and ask your browser to show you who is vouching for the identity of the server that's talking to you.  In Firefox, for example, clicking on the padlock symbol at the left-hand end of the address bar produces a little window telling me that this connection (to Reddit) is secure and is verified by DigiCert.  (I see that blockchain.info is also verified by DigiCert.)

Financial companies in the U.S. live in constant fear of being shut down for violating our government's "Know-Your-Client" laws, which were created to hinder money-laundering by drug lords but which seem to have generated some unhealthy incentives in law-enforcement agencies.  I think CoinBase is just trying to avoid getting hammered for being too lax.

I've long wished my phone could demand payment from the caller before it would ring.  Whitelisted callers could be exempted, and a button-press on my end could cancel the charge if the call turns out to be legit.

So . . . why don't I just transfer 0.001 bitcoin to some generally-agreed-to-be-Satoshi's address, and then say, "OK, Mr. Wright, move *that* output"?

So if the feds *do* have the private key(s), any individual with access to it can transfer the whole pile to a wallet of his own, and nobody can prove that the transaction wasn't done by some shadowy collaborator of DPR's . . . right?
