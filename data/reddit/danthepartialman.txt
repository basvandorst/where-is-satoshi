yes they have the power to spawn money, and magically insert numbers, BUT, just like any mmorpg, if youre the admin you know not to do that, its simple as even you would be harmed if you abuse it.  
also  
its within your interest to keep inflation low, not only because you'll cripple yourself as a country, your economy, but vultures will come as well.    
there is really no point in your argument up until now because youre arguing about this whole thing in relation to an individual, which it is not how shit works with currency

i see you dont know much about trading options but you should research more, the issuer has a legal obligation to fullfil the contract if the current owner of it decided to exercise it regardless of the price of the bitcoin.   
also, scarcity does not imply infinite value growth but given the endless scams and sudden ' disappearances of bitcoins' from millions of owners because the only 'guy who knew the password' passed away will keep this poo poo commodity at bay until its fully integrated and institutionalized, which will take a few years
