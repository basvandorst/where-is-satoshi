Not so sure about that as these are just speculations, if the chains are unsplit and agree to the upgrade then that would be nice. As I see the upgrade as a good thing for bitcoin.

Yea, segwit2x will still implement segwit proposal. First, SegWit2x seeks to upgrade bitcoin in two ways:
1. It would enact the long-proposed code optimization Segregated Witness (SegWit), which alters how some data is stored on the network.
2. It would set a timeline for increasing the network's block size to 2MB, up from 1MB today, to be triggered about three months after the SegWit activation.
