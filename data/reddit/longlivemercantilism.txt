ummm no,  because if you are already going to be purchasing Ads for your own products, you ended up saving money. because someone may offer you 1,000 dollars but you still would have to spend 1,000 to purchase additional ad space for your own product in a paper you don't own.
you end up with no net gain.
by placing your own ads in your own paper you are "purchasing" an ad for less than market price because you are cutting out the profit margin other papers are charging. so instead of having to spend 1,000 for ad space you are only spending 900, because it costs 900 to produce the paper. 
this is the general idea of economies of scope. 
now if someone was willing to purchase your ad space for 1,100 then it technically won't matter if you used your own ad space or sold it to that person, because the outcome would be the same.

you are the one missing understanding of economies of scope. 
is there a Opportunity cost of not selling the ad space to someone else, yes, but there is the opportunity cost of  purchase your ads from a outside newspaper looking at it from just this way you are at a wash because you lose 100 dollars ether way for the ad space you could have used for selling the ad space or using it your self. 
but lets expand this 
if instead you look at it from a company that has to purchases ads and wants to reduce their advertising cost. going from outsourcing (purchasing ads from independent news groups) to in house (purchasing those same independent news group) you save 100 and make money off the ad space you won't use and can continue to sell to other companies. you also have the advantage of not having to sell/ charging above market price ad space to your competitors which puts you at a greater advantage at reaching the consumers you are competing over, by limiting the exposure of competing products, or just having a lower price point because you are charging your competitors 100 more than your own products to get the same message out to the consumer.  
also the money saved from the Ad cost could mean lowering the price of your item which would mean greater sales depending on the elasticity of demand for your products or having a greater profit margin by keeping the same price. that would just depend on were point of profit maximization  is at.

it comes down to the money earned from selling Ad vs  money earned by someone purchasing the product that you own that can be directly related to you using your Ad. and you not paying for the additional profit that you would be charged if you used a third party Ad space.

The FED Owns the FED (independent Financing as its own assets), the reason for it is to minimize the potential for congress to manipulate the FED through funding to provide favorable Economic conditions before a major election.  the people who control the FED however are appointed by the president and Congress.

he talks a lot about removing the Fiance Industry but with it being such as large part of the economy and with so many jobs depending on it how does he think wages will fair when all those people are now moving into other sectors of the economy when we are already seeing a hollowing out of the middle class in terms of wages as well as jobs.

no I am not splitting hairs and I never said it wasn't a currency only that it is being used more like a Commodity than a currency due to still its limited acceptance compared to standard currency and most of the current demand being driven by investors trying to make a quick buck or as a way around large fees for money transfers.

the game isn't exactly rigged( it is in some parts but not as much as you think) the incentives are so dam high due to the amount of money that can be gained and the skill required for attain that  revenue for business. most of the top earners are from financial institutions or Managers of Multinational Companies who's decision makes or lose hundreds of millions or billions now which is much higher and more complex than it was back in the 80's( and all are paid accordingly). the fact most of them are also paid in Capital or capital gains to make sure they have a incentive to make their company successful is what is the double edge sword as less of their income is taxed at their actual tax bracket. but raising capital gains tax will only cause people to realize their gains before the increase. though there will be more long term saving but it will decrease investment spending which slow down productivity growth which effects the countries over all standard of living.

it depends on why you are there and how much it costs and what are the potential benefits.

the question then is does amount of money gained from losing that sector &lt;,&gt;,=the number of jobs created if the money is spent in the other sectors as well as creating jobs that pay the lesser greater or about the same.  
For the last 30 years we have seen the loss of repetitive jobs and even very simple non repetitive jobs due to automation, which has played a part in wealth and income inequality increase.  and has caused those to ether take a lower paying job or if they have the education and ability are able to move up to make more money.

 it took over 10 years before the housing bubble popped, and people were calling for action back in 1998.

they money labeled as an asset to a bank doesn't mean the money is still the banks as they are (based on the kind of contract you have with them) forced to give you the money on your deposit at any-point in time. the money is still yours, you have just loaned it to the bank.

yes but for the past few decades we have been seeing about 3% inflation
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:38:20
ummm... no it isn't a clear example of a deflationary currency, but an example of a commodity. Bitcoin is more a commodity right now then a currency and still has a long way to go.  This is no different then someone selling their pile of gold.

Congrats you are now mod of @_date: 2013-12-04 19:26:23
and wages have also increased(not at the same rate due to other factors).
there is nothing wrong with small inflationary monetary policy if(big if) people are able to know the actual rate of inflation now and in the future and plan for continued increase. 
the problem we have right now is that people have not been able to plan on their wages increasing with the rate of inflation which is one of the main causes for concern. 
if a meal cost you say 2% of your daily wages in 1980's and the same meal in 2010's still cost you 2% of your daily wages than there is no need for concern. because it doesn't matter what the rate of inflation is because the meal still costs the same percentage of your wages.

see NINJA loans, liar loans, complex bonds that no one purchasing under stood, ratting agencies conflict of interest, CDO's CDS( Credit default swaps) and no need to prove you could cover the potential losses (see AIG for example) shadow banking system and ignorant home buyers and bankers on housing prices never falling.

what was the reason for the shut down? and it is hard to make the jump to say bitcoins own infrastructure won't have this issue from time to time.
 this says more about having hard cash on hand than thinking another electronic payment/currency system will solve the issue.

yep because a Russian goverment owned news site is going to talk well of the US system.
