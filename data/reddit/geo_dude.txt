The network does not follow the same consensus rules and the amount of PoW is completely irrelevant in the discussion. The chains are incompatible.

I understand what you are saying and confusion on products should be avoided. But on the other hand but they are different protocols and different interpretations of the white paper. There is no main chain in the BTC vs. BCH debate and no one can justify claiming the title of bitcoin. That is inherent to its design.
But to be pragmatic, the amount of PoW and majority support is a pretty good gauge on what should be called bitcoin in public terms.

I agree there are a lot better alternatives (e.g. zCash) for the future and it is very unfortunate that Ver is the one to be associated with BCH. But it shouldn't draw attention away from the technical discussion.

The coins try to solve the same problem but have different approaches (zk-snarks vs. ring signatures). Also, all monero transactions are private by default, and Zcash is opt-in.

Maybe the comments in this post can do a better job helping you understand my point.

The price of 9k that appeared on coinbase is a temporary spike resulting from a rapid influx of users simultaneously buying at market price. That is what can happen when a new coin is released all of sudden as each user pushes the price up. The exchange froze trading soon afterwards to let the market cool down, and the price is stable at 3.5k. It is to say that the engineers should have seen this coming, but at most this is incompetence from coinbase, not malice. All this conspiracy mumbo-jumbo is absurd if you cannot provide any legit evidence.

BTC somehow turned in to a store of value where people only participate to increase their wealth. BCH tries hard to be a currency and was forked with the idea that for this purpose, a block size increase is long overdue. Granted, it is a temporary solution but a pretty good one at that. You can agree or disagree but nobody owns the brand name.

It is not about being right or wrong. It is about the people that are going to lose a majority of their savings in this bubble. There will be winners, maybe including you, but there will be many more losers. Selfishness and greed have taken reign over what bitcoin used to stand for many years ago.
