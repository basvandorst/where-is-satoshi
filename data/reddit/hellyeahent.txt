nice, but how high is fee ? They have to take risk of fork, arent they ?
@_date: 2015-06-13 18:10:52
numer of transaction is not that important and cant be equaled to stress test. I mean now we can have 1000-1500 transactions per block so its 6000 per h or 144000-210000 transactions per day and whe are not near that number yet.
@_date: 2015-06-05 14:00:31
yes and its losses volume, happy about that, but still other exchanges look too much on it :-/
@_date: 2015-06-04 12:03:20
not rly, what about flood ? That doesnt help at all. 
should be something like 4 * last 32 blocks and we might got flooded for few hours max that way. You all seem to forgot that doesnt mean blocks are 4mb now they will be 200-1000kb as ussual. It just helps to keep fee low what is important for microtransactions and got 1st confirmation usually in 1st block

How much credit cards company charges fuel companies ? If BTC is much cheaper they might think about it as secondary option then as primary when ppl get used to it and could tank for 1% cheaper

can ppl cashout from steam ??
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:17:50
you could buy BTC from your funds and they will just buy for 102-103% and you would send them to relatives (and yes you would need to learn them how to sell them when they got them on wallet )
That many people seems like a good bussines even if u get 1-2%

This summer I went to US 1st time. I was shocked that I had to give my credit card to everyone I stayed with to make "deposit" - even If I paid already. The truth is they could charge me anything.
2nd problem: Rental company scammed me for ~55$ (I had to pick up car at 12 and I was ~11:55 - that "extra hour" cost me 24,99$ and 2 weeks after I gave car back they charged me ~30$ for fuel - I tanked FULL and drove 3 miles. Do I have to tank and than push 3 miles to rental company so I dont get charged ? o.O ) very dissapointed : (

Why I cant buy it on bittrex or craptsy ? 
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:04:05
BTC is too expensive I believe and need improvements. 
There is 40% more BTC to come (now its 3600 dayly = 2 500 000$/day to maintain same price and if price goes higher its even more. Even if only 25% of that is sold right away Its still significant amount). Power usage/cost - HUGE
BC/BLK - 1% inflation = with that price about ~500$/day to maintain same price. So BC "costs" 500$/day for now with is paid for securing network through POS. POS - super low energy consumption
I think BTC should switch into POS asap instead of wasting resources to build new asics and to produce energy. In long run POS wins.
POS&gt;POW with confirmation time too. 1 block in BC is 1 minute, but transation time is about ~10sec so it can be used to buy big mac and can u buy big mac with BTC ? How much fee would that be ? (in price %) and how long will confirmation take for such a small transation 3 days ?
For investor its way better than other alts because of fixed amount + multipool with mine shitcoins to add value into BC ( 
Add to that we have probably the smartest dev of POS in general (working on POS 2.0 in silence) and some rly telented ppl who makes everything we need/wants (Bit/black halo - decentralized exchange and other stuff ) + we want our coin to be used by masses (through conkite terminal for example) + ..... This coin is still very young and already successful with great ideas. In 6 months I think +500-1000% (and if BTC price rises maybe even Twice of that). 
Failure chance - dunno, like 5% ? [Arent worried about foundation/dev being unfair but rather whole POS colapse somehow). Thats why I bought black, when the price month ago when I bought was 14-18(!!) times lower. And now, 2 months later Im up ~400% and havent sold any yet coz I think Its place is to replace LTC as

@_date: 2014-10-21 22:45:28
pow &gt; pos 
BTC sux until:
51% fixed 
centralized mining 
ASICS - unfair
still high inflation (7 000 000 BTC )
BTC distribution is like DOGE = general trend down after big up until /2 reward than pump, than back to downtrend. After u get close to 21kk BTC u will change into POS with 0% inflation (Pos can be save with 0,5% now and if as big as BTC 0,1% per year or even less) 
BTC will colapse - too expensive (noone get paid in BTC + huge amount of money for mining) and expensive for non US/China because we have to pay FX + not annonimous - I have to BUY btc using my bank account so gov knows Ive got BTC's and how many than I have to withdrawal them so If I get paid for sth they know how much too. Useless
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:10:23
Thats why POW will fail and POS will be king 
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:19:53
That would pump BTC price +100$. Many ppl have problems/cant use bankaccounts to play so they would buy btc to do. 
P* might do that coz BTC is cheap for them. They have to pay ~2% to skrill ~2% for neteller and 2-3% CC. And when sb deposit 5k$ withdrawal 5k$ and deposit again (and ppl do that a lot coz get cashback from companies who get 2% per deposit [and give back ~0,4-0,5%] - they have to pay everytime, so its miliones per month.
If I remember correctrly p* has 550 mil revenue but only 220 mil profit (and they dont pay big takes on Isle of man :] )

And attack would be that expensive, now default fee is about 0,025$. Attacker can send with 0,03$ fee and those transactions have prority over default ones. 0,03* 1000-1500 = 30$-45 per block * 6 = 200$ * 24 = ~5000$ per day. 
With 20mb blocks... 100 000$ per day :)  (and only default fees transactions do not go through remember that)

some people are here to make money not to contribute to protocol (because they dont have skills) - but they are important too - provide volume.

@_date: 2015-05-30 15:23:07
so if its get full it got mined right away or just other transactions are waiting for next block to be approved ?
@_date: 2015-05-21 12:47:29
blind people :D
@_date: 2015-05-30 15:37:29
I do not. Imagine you are miner with 20-30% chance of finding block. Block is 1mb like now and fee is huge for 800-1000kb . So they will spend lets say 0,5 btc to make block big and let unaware people pay few times more than that in fees.
Default fee should be as low as it is now, if your transaction is important you should pay more. In future we should increase fee though and block size too or at least have emergency plan like: if number of transaction which wait for confirmation is more than 5k increase default fee 2x, if 10k default fee 4x etc etc That way somebody will have hard time to flood the network

noone would like u and u die alone :D
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:32:46
that means BTC will fall to ~150. If mining costs are so low they will dump as much as they make profit.
and thats why POS coins are better. Hope someone will notice it soon ^^

ups did we break it ? :D
@_date: 2015-05-06 09:59:46
It wont change anything, whats difference if block is 0,8mb/1mb or 0,8mb/20mb ? Its better to have bigger number if block "wants to be" 1,2mb or 1,5mb later.
Imo 20mb sollution is good because - its ok for now and in 5-10 years we will have 10TB-100 TB harddrives and iphone15 will have easly 10% of that
Connection - now everybody has min 20mbit/s what is enough for 20mb blocks and that number will increase 10 fold or more.
Go back 5-10 years and bring back harddrive sizes and inernet connection speeds

How is that better ? 
It cant go down* (decentralized, if *build on BTC; will die when BTC blockchain die)

@_date: 2015-08-17 13:24:31
This attack was small. Imagine it will last days and fees would rise every block/few blocks so still most transactions wont go through. With 1mb block (or I should say 500-600 kb because rest is normal use) its easy. They can Do that cheap for lets say 2-3 days, 1 day break and again from the begining (low fee)
I dont see any problems with 8mbs blocks, because its max size and this limit will be used only while attacked now

Why patch in january ? The greatest minds in the world have to work 6 months to change number from 1mb to 8mb and make coinage 2-3 times more important so we cant be flooded and to clean 0 fees transactions faster ?
Do we have any other problems (?)

So that means there is super cheap way to attack BTC right now by flooding blocks. I hope it wont happen but imagine someone (who already did that in past) decide to flood network for weeks. How is your version of BTC protocol can protect us from ~5 TH/s and 2-20x standard fee ? 
Price would drop 50 or 100$ and someone would make ten of milions and take it from regulard BTC holders. 
Do you even have "fast hard fork" project against that kind of attack or you just will take your time (months) to think If we should or not to do it ? So many devs and you work so slow, Do you cooperate or compete with themselves ?
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:37:44
additionally we should try / calculate how many TX/s BTC can handle right now. Mb If sb attack us with 2000 TX/s BTC network crashes. Would be nice to test it somehow so in future we wont have that problem (or find sulution for example make buffor with incoming transaction and cap TX/s  - for now more than 20 TX/s with 1 mb block is not needed)

why ? Bigger block = no unconfirmed transactions like now. 0 fee transactions should be canceled after 3-10 blocks or 30-60 minutes and you cant spam networks anymore. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:58:33
whats which old devs than ? Will they work together after succesful transition into XT ?
Is there any list of core devs and XT devs ? 
@_date: 2015-08-29 21:11:03
because BTC its needed to maintain low transaction fee (so BTC can be used for micro payments) and to protect against flood
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:38:56
we are fine, miners will get some extra cash, new solutions will be implemented and btc will be stronger :)
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:59:57
we have unlimited data cap in europe, 120 mb/s costs me 25$/month
@_date: 2015-07-15 09:13:07
We should dump after 20-25 blocks, why wait longer ? If transaction is legit, you want BTC back to send them with higher fee not to wait 2 days. But If its spam we should take fee and send it back.
We can handle 500 000 - 1 000 000 for now (1-2 GB mempool)
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:41:09
pay 0,06$ in fee and get it as fast as always (works for me). But if u want to do not pay or pay standard 0,03$ thats ur choice
@_date: 2015-07-03 14:18:59
but who provide those BTC for GBTC ? (for XBT its knc miner right ? btw. they did great job, they mine and can sell + take fee for that )
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:27:37
How much memory node has ? I think 50mb isnt that much, is it ?
@_date: 2015-07-15 09:04:39
there shouldnt be possibility to mine empty blocks, just put it into protocol that blocks has to be filled min 1%
if chinnese farms will mine empty blocks those 25 BTC will be worth less and less, because we will dump coins so thats not long term solution. I hope private miners will dump them too
@_date: 2015-07-03 21:06:09
why wont he try change block 90 and mine 91 ? 
What about pool operators who find 2 blocks in a row, couldnt they change the 1st one ? Could they gain anything ?
@_date: 2015-04-25 11:01:08
1000 sat in 2540 will be 1000 bucks !
@_date: 2015-04-05 14:02:13
why dolar will crash before 2020 ? I think it wont, USA print it so much and inflation is so low campared to printed amount. You know why ? Because USD is world currency :) You can print as much as you like, because whole world pay for it. That means your assumption "usd will fall before 2020" means whole world's monetary system will fall. And I think it will last much more longer than that, and even after the dept will be so huge, there will be some "amnesty" and some people will lose of course but country/world order will maintain

I have opened long and okcoin.com stopped working. I cant close my possition even if I want to and refresh page for about 2h's already. What should I do , will I get refund ?
@_date: 2015-04-22 00:10:14
far away from 1.0 though
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:38:47
No, its 3600 BTC a day / 108000 monthly which drags price down :) 25 mil usd per month for miners is way too much for "the cheapest way to transfer money". Who pays that ? If you think long enough, you will realize the one who bought and hold. I wish we have 410 000 block sooner, it will make BTC cheaper
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:47:44
sorry man, you are going to stop being BTC user after that ?
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:19:28
yeah, used in past wont again. We should open new topic: do not use cryptsy ever
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:55:35
Additional selling preasure, even its only 20 BTC/day on all exchanges combined its always something. And If you say price doesnt matter - it does. With BTC price too low, people will abandon it, less people will have more BTC worth less (bad too) and noone would like to work to develop anything. Higher price, more people, more innovation, more common use/trust (which is essencial - you can travel to europe and spend USD even if its not national currency - because people know and trust USD, but if you would like to pay in France in EGP (Egipt) they wont take it because they wont know it/trust it. BTC must be used by milions to be aknowledged :)

"BTCChina currently accounts for nearly 30 percent of the global bitcoin trading volume"
Not rly if there is no fee. I can make buttcoin with 100mil volume+ everyday on my own exchange
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:41:30
They can change price by trading while on .com open possitions are locked ?
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:21:06
OKcoin 20x levarage here - will gamble and open long :) (about 800-1000 BTC :D ) Hope it wont go 5% down before it goes up ^^
@_date: 2015-04-17 11:22:30
rekt stands for what ? :D
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:35:08
thats bs, they should have stopped trading on okcoin.cn too. Highly unfair
@_date: 2015-04-20 12:01:24
Where is prifit here ? You buy for 100 euro in country A and sell for 100 euro in spain ? 
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:15:11
I dont like this 0% maker model for one reason - bots. They will take a lot of money in "calm days" ( = when price is stable) they will just buy 249,50, sell 249,60 when the price is 249,55 :(
0,05% fee maker 0,2% taker would be nice..
@_date: 2015-09-12 12:10:03
if people will be greedy with biger blocks, miners do not have to mine transaction lets say lower than 0,0001 fee, so miners can choose. They can mine 1mb blocks too if they want to and for few years with so low fees compared to block reward I dont see it as a problem for them and taking freedom. Later on, when lets say avg fees/block will be about 10% or more block reward they will consider upgrading their hardwere/brandwidth. Still they can choose to do so or not. Miners are businessman's , they will know what to do so im not worried about unfair disadvantages with 1mb or 8mb blocks. They will be fine
@_date: 2015-09-15 13:11:12
how are you going to sell those 1-3 mil BTC 
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:24:24
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:18:13
you mean after 10 am (4pm chinesse timezone ? )
And If I opened possition at 3.59 I wont get refund ? Why not ?

made my day, thanks bro : D
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:01:55
agree, "next block fee" might be high like 1$ but "economic fee" shouldnt be more than 0,05$ (and you decide with that fee how much you care about speed. Its the same today with fedex)
or offchain solution for micropayments and make them as cheap as possible and main chain competetive
@_date: 2015-10-24 16:17:02
sick, In my country is about 8% and I still think its BS and it should be close to 50
@_date: 2016-05-27 17:59:02
is that scam ?
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:18:26
do u feel safe with okcoin ? (answer hell no)
do u feel safe with bitfinex ? (answer dunno, but they got hacked and lost some coins, fortunately they could cover it )
do u feel safe with other exchanges which arent regulated and do not show us real time proof our coins are safe ?
I feel safe with them because they are under regulations so can sue them if they got hacked/will lose my coins
@_date: 2015-10-14 22:54:52
arent that costs which they have ? I mean arent those bank's fees ?
@_date: 2015-10-14 20:16:04
they have 0% maker and 0% taker fee ? So how do they earn ? 
@_date: 2015-03-24 22:31:49
Next step - buy BTC directly through neteller :) Would love that
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:16:03
what about inflation ? :p
@_date: 2015-10-06 09:04:12
interests, about 10% per year for BTC and about 15% for USD
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:58:58
And how do I sign anything ?
@_date: 2015-10-03 21:31:41
u have one mil ? Niceee

@_date: 2015-11-03 17:43:29
thanks for post, Im lending BTC but its not worth (about 0,03%/day) the risk.
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:47:44
wow, 6 times better performance ? Last time they said so, did they deliver product with those specifications ?
If yes it means BTC price can go 6 times lower... so about 40-50$ O_o
Imo Next BTC price growth when we meet technological barriers + ofc halving
@_date: 2016-05-27 17:44:13
when payouts are schedueld ?
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:09:11
BTC/NBT is like BTC/USD
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:06:29
I think:
before halving hashrate would go as high as possible - that should increase price and couse pump (I think +100%) and in halving day hashrate will go very low, and cause dump. But I think BTC will hit 120$ in 2016 so it would be much easier to gain 100%.
@_date: 2015-11-01 13:26:31
so when its over owner will dump thousands of btc on the market.. (?)
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:04:27
@_date: 2015-10-12 10:01:36
whatt ? You mean 5x default fee ? How stupid solution is that and what does it changes ? I mean attacker will increase fee so it will be over that default again. This helps only miners and encourages them to spam tx's and fill  blocks and paralize network from time to time
@_date: 2015-10-14 22:59:16
maybe 21 will take those bits after time ? I mean they need to be connected and mine but dont need reward. It can go to 21
@_date: 2015-02-19 10:04:17
We dont need that many transactions, yet because after halving price might go 2 times higher and its the same isnt it ? 
So in future lets say 1800 BTC mined per day . 12,5 btc per block and same level of txn is still fine if price goes 2x higher.
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:32:54
so it took u 18 monts total ? Huge skills : )
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:20:35
complex as always, couldnt you at least put this custom fee somewhere in advanced tab or sth ?
@_date: 2015-02-17 11:56:39
pump and dump coin, it was implemented in blackcoin 6 month ago or so, just stolen idea
@_date: 2015-02-17 11:57:31
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:08:29
use excoin instead, they do :)
@_date: 2015-10-08 09:39:04
how is that possible this transaction is so big ?
