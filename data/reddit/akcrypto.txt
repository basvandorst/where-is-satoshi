The undermining of the network (a reorganization or a “rollback”) would virtually destroy the value, making it just as self harming to the attacker’s as whatever the issue was in the first place, if not more.  There is also an ability to fork (see other posts) which can help protect from this.
What he is referring to however, is getting the majority of the network (51%) of nodes to agree to undo a transaction carried out by the network. Basically rewrite the chain and in doing so reverse a hack (what he was referring to at the time).

Not sure about a cold storage wallet but I know the enjin wallet allows you to trade between many different tokens including stable coins.
Edit: this exchange is done from within the wallet through Kyber, Changelly, etc.
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:32:08
They have it setup so they have access to your wallet despite what you may think, they let you setup a password to fool you. As soon as you deposit any amount to “get started” they take it.  Open your eyes my dude.
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:28:02
There are wallets with an exchange or swap option built into the wallet Itself but these are not cold storage wallets. I’m also not sure if they have limit options so you’d have to use another app for price alerts and be ready to login in and exchange.
Edit: DCA is the best investment method period. This has been proven statistically many times over with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:36:16
Coinbase doesn’t owe you if your account is hacked or the whole site is hacked.  The purpose of bitcoin is being the custodian of you’re own money. That being said if this is a pure investment for you, there are other options between a hardware wallet and an exchange that will make life easier.

Don’t know the exact figure but if you watch whale alerts on twitter you will see some pretty large amounts being transferred to and from coinbase on the regular.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:49:04
This is absolutely not what that means.  This isn’t a stat of people who only hold on coinbase.  I could send 10,000btc to coinbase and get counted as the top 10%, buy some more btc and then move it off the exchange and it would still be counted. 
10,000 was an arbitrary number, whales hold much more than that.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:17:10
In a very short explanation it means that small holders are selling their BTC while large holders are buying that same BTC for a discount.   
Noobs are panic selling on large price swings while whales laugh and buy it all up.
Edit: small holders meaning noobs panic selling. And while the stat does not implicitly say this, everyone knows it happens when the price dumps...  For all the butt hurt people not understanding I was making an inference.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:06:47

I agree quantum computing would be the big challenge however even if an attacker did break the chain and “stole” all the bitcoin the price would reflect the break in trust and basically in a matter of moments drop the price to nothing.

I’d ask the same to you? 
If he was a socialist he would’ve made it equally distributive with full control by an authoritarian figure. Most likely having access to your wallet to take from you when you’re wealth became greater than that of another. 
I’d bet he was capitalist but not in the sense that we see today. More likely a capitalist with morals if I had to guess. 
Bitcoin is equal access to all but not equal in terms of wealth distribution. It benefits those who seek freedom, socialism is not freedom it is captivity.
@_date: 2019-10-30 00:05:47
The earth is round bud. No amount of fancy words or definitions you use to describe it make it work any better in real life. I can make a CAD drawing but it only matters how it functions in real life. Socialism is a failed economic system spun from communism to fool idiots like yourself to adopt it.  It gives big brother the power to control your very life and despite what you believe capitalism to be, it is in fact the opposite. 
You can become some despite the “big bad corporations” that you’ve been brainwashed to hate. Socialism is the definition of dependence on the state.  The only level in which it works is on the communal level where you give to your food pantries or support a friend when they lose their house to a fire etc.  On a national level it collapses because fools like you actually believe the government will provide for them without waste or corruption. 
I implore you to educate yourself and stop fearing the boogie man that doesn’t exist.

I agree if they are sneaky they maybe able to offload into fiat without anyone knowing there are still two problems, first the blockchain is watched by many people and now by many companies who look for these sorts of attacks, second if they did offload to fiat more than likely they could be tracked down through account names, bank accounts, etc.

Whether you study it or are one you still are stuck on the words and ideas of those before you. 
I’ll also circle back to the fact that what you can write and say and what you can execute are two very different things.  I can say a bunch of nice, happy, and intelligent words but where does that get me in practice, no where.  If your hybrid theory is remotely based on socialism, none of the thing you list at the end will be possible in an innovative sense.  You can have or be all of those things but inside of a designed set of specific rules and laws designed to control. 
Capitalism allows for the mold to be broken, it allows for the sky to be the limit. It allows you yourself to provide the needs to meet your own emotional and psychological well being. 
I guess that’s the point really, why would I depend on anyone else to make me feel happy and fulfilled?  It’s laughable people like yourself look elsewhere rather than within themselves to meet those needs.  You blame corporations and governments for you’re own emotional and psychological deficiencies. No one is holding you back in our society but yourself and people who think otherwise are loony.  Get of social media, turn off the news. Explore and discover, innovate and question.

My point being the system you say you’ve hybridized into one of your own sounds better in a computer simulation than in practice.  Judging by your compete deflection of my two questions you know as well as I do it couldn’t work. There’s no way on a socioeconomic level to not have a governing body or a conformist aspect to it for it to work. I understand it’s hard to admit. 
Also you’re right I was proposing that because I wanted you to see if you would bite, guilty.

Socialism is monoculture. Despite your regurgitation of the definition of socialism I’m now positive you have no idea what it really means. Socialist governments are not decentralized. They rely on a central entity to collect and distribute, irrespective of what that entity may look like, 1 or many people for example.  Socialism requires conformity and it stifles any incentive to be your best. 
Don’t take my argument as saying the current US government is any better. In fact I’d argue the infiltration of cronyism and socialism is what has defiled our current government. 
I’m very glad those in the early modern days weren’t socialist, we would never have made any scientific or explorative achievements as there would’ve been no incentive, only oppression.

This is a laughable misconception. Large corporations offer a service. They also offer jobs. I don’t see how providing a service, giving jobs that provide healthcare and retirements etc is a bad thing?  And profit maximization is the point. It’s what drives companies to be better, to reduce waste, to provide a fair priced service. Competition my friend. 
Monopolies happen yes but there are ways to overcome such problems. 
I’d rather a company provide a service than a corrupt wasteful government. And there isn’t a single government in the world that isn’t at least one or both of those things. Not one.

I’d have to whole heartedly disagree with what you’ve said in terms of the godlike creature aspect. And while I don’t or try not to victim blame I do think it is on ones self to see life from a ghost like perspective (floating above ones body observing).  
We all have it bad but generally, it could be worse.  Societal pressures and the like change the parameters of what we perceive to be “doing well” or not but it doesn’t change the fact that ones mind can supersede these superficial parameters and on a biological level at least understand we all have what we need to survive, even if it’s what you and I would call the bare minimum. 
We are wholly in agreement today’s society exerts an unyielding and ever changing definition of ones life and what it means to be doing well. It is why I will always suggest we all look inward at ourselves rather than outward at others.
Edit: I will also say that in any society humans judge their own success by their neighbors so it seems to be an evolution of human nature and less about the society one resides in.  Animals display jealousy as well.

I want the freedom to choose. I want the freedom to break the mold. I want the freedom to give and take as I see fit. I want zero intervention in my life from any outside force or actor.  I want my unalienable rights. The systems you propose even your own hybrid system are in direct contrast to all of that.   
Why does it go back to suicide, emotion, and psychological well being for you?  Are you really so brainwashed to think that your own emotional health is out of your own hands? Are you really so naive to think that your health is dependent on someone other than yourself?
I haven’t been brainwashed into doing or thinking anything. I can use my skills for what I want when I want.  Much better than being forced to conform in my eyes.

I don’t think you understood what I meant but that’s okay, I’m  not sure you understand or even try to understand what anyone else has to say. It must be tough to be so intelligent that everyone else’s thoughts or opinions fall so short of your own?  I hate to be stereotypical but it’s a classic philosophers mindset.  You are better than no one and smarter than no one, as much as you’d like to believe it.
People can overcome a lot of bad situations without being godlike and quite honestly it just sounds like you’re making it sound far fetched on purpose.  If you don’t have the brain power that’s on you.  Don’t use a scapegoat to try and make it sound impossible because it’s not. 
I also don’t think you’re in any position to talk on the reality of physics unless you are also a physicist?

To say that we are hopelessly all going to be depressed and suicidal is not only asinine but a little scary if I’m being honest.  I mean gosh, no one is safe from it because we are not godlike enough to see through it!? I’m flabbergasted! 
Good luck with your experiment but I’d be willing to bet some bitcoin you’re the first voted off the island as no one will ever meet your level of “wokeness”.  
Lastly, whoever or whatever brainwashed you has ruined your life. ✌��

You’re conflating “whales are buying” with “whales are buying a lot”.  The post was never about how much the whales are buying and more about the fact that the whales are buying in general while the small fries are selling.

My favorite thing about those who study philosophy is that they’re so stuck on the words of those that came before them they can’t come up with a thought of their own.  
Read between the lines of what Marx and Engels wrote. Have a thought of your own.  They wanted to design a system to control the population through catering to their every need.  Socialism and communism is the ultimate control mechanism. It was designed to fool people like yourself into thinking their every is provided for so that they would never question or break the mold.  In keeping with that I will admit Marx and Engels were genius in this way. 
If you truly want to live in a world like that, I weep for you my friend.

Judging from the whale alert twitter handle that is highly unlikely albeit possible. Just good for thought!

I will indeed take you up on that, always interested in new and unique viewpoints.
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:07:19
Governments can’t operate properly without internal waste and corruption so voluntarily giving to them would be the start but eventually when normal people see corruption and waste they will refuse and be forced to give. (That’s how both communism and socialism really work).
Yes you’ve shown many times in this debate you know the definition as recited from text, bravo really, it’s about the only smart thing you said in two days. Further your fear of the big ole boogie man (corporations) is probably the most laughable and “brainwashed” thing I’ve ever read. Do you sit up at night fearing amazon under your bed?  
We haven’t destroyed the planet and quite frankly as someone with a degree in environmental science the classic liberal fear mongering idea that we have is a joke. Real scientist know this.  There is zero evidence of what magnitude and anyone claiming to have that answer is a liar and most likely smoking peyote.  We can do better, yes, but we can also have that happen through competitive markets. All people want a healthy planet and they will choose to buy services from those who promote it.  That’s how it works, doesn’t sound very dark and scary does it?
Also I understand that you are too dense to get this but free and socialism are antithetical to one another, it’s really not complicated to understand. It is also is not decentralized, it requires the collective to rely on a centralized power or controlling body. It may start all furry and nice as you describe but again in practice it has failed and will continue to fail. Those in control will fall victim to greed as with all cases of socialism and it’s ugly cousins. 
Lastly I will circle back to your torturing of humans comment which reading again is so laughable I’m actually laughing out loud with some colleagues about it.  No one is forcing me to go to work to provide a service. It’s voluntary and I can choose to contribute as much or as little as I want. I can also choose which service to provide at my own free will. If you truly were wise, you would know free will has no place in communism or socialism.  
In closing I will say I weep for those you supposedly teach and only pray that they see through what you so fondly (and quite frankly sadly) believe.  If you truly want a future where you have zero control of your life or the outcome of it by all means go for it. I’d take a life where I succeed or fail based on my effort and free will.  Socialism is lazy, socialism is corrupt, and socialism would mean the death of innovation, science, and all things free.
Don’t fear the boogie man ;)

You are nuts if you think socialism is the answer. Capitalism has raised more people out of poverty than any other economic system and that is a fact. Socialism on a national level and even a state level crumble under their own weight. Corruption, waste, and fraud make sure of it. For someone who is an “teacher” I thought you’d be a bit wiser on this?  Godspeed to those you teach.
Edit: do you not think socialism would be any different? We would be dependent on our government in every aspect of our life? Or do you not understand the word dependence?
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:57:54
I’m not sure if you’re just dense or don’t understand the dynamic between give and take but a government that only gives would also have to take from something or somewhere? Or are we breaking the laws of thermodynamics here?  
And again you can quote whoever or whatever you want but I’m practice it fails. And id argue there are socialist style countries even if they don’t fit the exact definition you’re so stuck to.
Also I’ll wait for you to refute the fact that capitalism has lifted more people out of poverty and created more opportunities for people than any other economic system.  I know you can’t but it will be fun to watch you quote all the philosophers you can.  What’s written on paper is one thing, what is executed in real life is another.
Lastly socialism was spun from communism too fool people like you into giving up your freedoms for a perceived greater good. It will never work, just like taxes don’t work. Unless you actually believe they do in which case you’re not educated enough for a debate let alone being a teacher.
@_date: 2019-10-29 23:42:40
Which is why I said from the beginning satoshi wasn’t a socialist...
@_date: 2019-10-29 13:49:04
Socialism is not freedom no matter which way you try and polish it. Socialism causes people to look outward for help with there problems rather than inward. It creates reliance on big brother and whether that’s a single person or an entire government it really doesn’t matter.  
There are types of socialism that are viable but really in the end they all lead to one thing, reliance. 
I also find it funny that you use the taxes for for common good example as if this can’t or doesn’t happen in a capitalist society.  
I would also argue charitable giving and communal giving could and should replace taxes. Why would I want to give a corrupt government my money when easily 50% will be wasted?  I’d rather give to a local food pantry and shelter where 1-5% will be wasted.
Socialism is not the answer. It’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

They pay for your student loan debt today and tax you for it tenfold over the next 20 years. Either way you pay.

@_date: 2019-08-14 18:36:03
Articles stating this look at pure power consumption, what they fail to take into account is how many people use renewables for power.  For instance I know people who use solar, wind, and even hydro as ways to generate power for both mining and activities related to mining.
I would also urge you to look into the power consumption of the worlds top 5 biggest banks.  I don’t know the answer but I’d be willing to bet they use way more power for their operations combined than the entire bitcoin network.

@_date: 2019-05-05 21:21:37
Buy a little bit at a time. If it drops a significant amount just buy more. You dump all in at once and you’re opening yourself to more risk than you need to IMO. If you’re long on bitcoin a 2k price difference over a period of buys (for example) shouldn’t kill you. 
This does all depend on how much financial freedom you have with the money you intend to use. 
Which is obviously something that you shouldn’t share with internet strangers.

It’s hard to reason with or reassure people who FOMO’d in. They more than likely got a short grasp on what bitcoin is from 1 article after a price pump and went all in.  They don’t think that those who are long and Hodl are doing so for what it represents and for what it truly is. 
If you and your story are real, you epitomize what FOMOer’s are after and honestly, what most of us are after.   
I respect your story and discipline considering your average buy position. Best of luck in retirement comrade.

A lot of people and or a couple big whales hit a full sell or partial sell price point at 9k. Price dumped and those who weren’t experienced probably panicked and sold for a loss only adding to the overall dump.

@_date: 2019-05-16 17:11:06
Buying a little at a time is a better idea, people who FOMO all in and see the price swings tend to get panic and anxiety stricken.
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:26:02
Very true. FOMO by definition is a very undisciplined approach to investing.  I think it’s also why crypto sees such massive dips when prices start to decline. All the FOMOer’s bail when things get dicey.

Until you can buy all of your needs/wants with Bitcoin directly this will be the reality.  I envision a future where any thing can be purchased with Bitcoin and exchanges are only used for trading to Alts (the few that remain... if any).

Any one who says a certain coin will pump owns that coin so be wary of all advice. The best thing you can do is YOUR OWN research from year over year charts, trading volume, and real world adoption.  
Once you’re ready sign up for coinbase and make some small purchases. Do not dump everything into a coin/token all at once. If you know trading fundamentals you can day trade but for most of us buy and Hodl is always the best strategy. 
Remember markets are always on the move and crypto is volatile,  don’t get discouraged, stay strong.
