Eww, don't sully the Sagan legacy by such a grotesque association :(

But there are hundreds of other payment processor options, which can handle CC transactions or donations - where AJ or his companies never get CC information.
I agree that PayPal is too big and really sucks, but let's call things what they are.  They're dominant, they're not a monopoly.

Well stop giving it all away!  I know sloths are supposed to be slow, but goddamn :D
Edit: oops, the word I was thinking of was ***philanthropist***.  Umm... So &lt;insert joke about alimony/child-support here&gt;? :p

Just because PayPal closes its doors to you doesn't mean you have to jump back a century, any more than Holden/GM refusing your business would force you to resort to a horse-drawn buggy.
There are many payment processors out there (which process Visa and MasterCard etc), who would be happy to take their piece of the conspiracy nutter pie.

Sounds like it's intentionally misleading, in such a way that can easily lead new adopters to lose their crypto, which is pretty tbh.

Mate... some people spend their time and effort drawing cartoons of the Disney princesses getting massive/fat and crushing dudes with their feet, or write multi-page-long posts arguing about the correct pronunciation of 'LevioSAH'.
At least *this* is something I actually want to see on my screen lol - it's kinda interesting :)

I was smiling at the comments before this
Read yours and felt my face serious the hell up
You only make this mistake (sober) once!!!

Is this KYC-free, properly peer to peer?
@_date: 2018-09-09 07:38:13
It still completely boggles my mind that any significant number of people did this...
@_date: 2018-08-20 05:10:24
Heh, coincidence - I just re-watched I Am Sam a few nights ago...  Cause I wanted to cry lol

If you have any **other** junk worth $250-500 a pop, I'd gladly take it off your hands for you mate.

KYTOWWWWNNN!  Why don't you take me to...

G'day Amichateur, I'm curious, can you please elaborate on why you have a problem with this?
Do you have a similar problem with every person who lets their child act, be in a commercial, or ever appear in their local paper (say, for receiving an award or taking part in a charity drive)?  If so, well, at least that would be consistent and I'd have to respect that, even if we may have differing opinions... But if you somehow think one or more of the others would be okay, but this is not, then I would invite you to explain that difference :)
I have witnessed hundreds of parents over the years who have absolutely done their children a disservice with what they've posted of them online, but this doesn't appear to be one such example.
Edit: After reading the other comments by the OP I'm a bit more on your side.  Kid being used as a prop more than actually involving her in a meaningful way.  Doh.

So long as the doctrine (definition: a set of teachings) is based in reality, and doesn't involve dogma (beliefs that are not to be questioned or challenged), that shouldn't be a problem.

Season 2, Episode 14 - "The Carpet" @ 5:39
@_date: 2018-10-14 13:28:44
It's from The Office (US), it's a picture of a young Michael Scott and his mentor Ed Truck which was published in Vol. 5 Issue 3 of the fictional in-universe staff newsletter for the Dunder Mifflin paper company.  First seen @ 05:39 in Episode 14 of Season 2, "The Carpet", the picture is again seen briefly @ 06:18 in Episode 4 of Season 3, "Grief Counseling", after Ed has died.
I'm not an Office bot, nor am I some savant Rainman when it comes to this stuff, just an insomniac who sometimes gets really really bored lol

That would be a response to [Vanity Sizing]( - the process whereby manufacturers abandon sizes based on standard measurements, and instead give 'fatass' sizes successively **smaller and smaller sounding** size designations, to make their fatass customers feel better.  Then you end up with US 'smalls' sometimes being complete tents.  And those from other fatass countries, like mine (Australia) and the UK.
Everything should just be sized in objective measurements probably.

Right, but I still don't think it would be smart to leave your life savings in any crypto... you should only be floating whatever you can afford to lose (most of).
Same goes for any volatile commodity...  And maybe I could have been clearer in my post but I was also thinking of like not putting it all in one wallet, that kind of thing.
@_date: 2018-10-26 02:48:02
Why on earth would you have 100k in any one thing unless you were happy with the risk though...  Diversify! :)
I've only got 1k in crypto and I still made sure I split it up...

You tha real MVP lol
I love that this is what we do with ridiculously advanced technology
@_date: 2018-10-07 21:08:04
Unfortunately too many parents still think it's healthy to teach their kids that they're born broken and need saving, and/or that hitting them is acceptable (from people who say they love them and are 'doing it for their own good'), so sadly I think many are still at least a few steps further back than this :/
But every generation we see more and more evolving past these archaic and harmful notions, so yes there's hope :)

That seems short-sighted - you would want to contrast it by whatever you can easily exchange it for, which could then be easily exchanged for the things you want to buy...

Or you do this for 64chars or whatever, and then give them the new password as all of that plus "1" on the end.
