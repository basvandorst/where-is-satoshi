Quick question, is it available for tiger direct Canada and can it be used in store? 
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:19:33
The source is along the bottom like just about every Web comic out there. At least the op didn't crop it out like the real scumbag posts on here.

As a Canadian I shall personally apologize to him but if he bought last week he should still be higher than current price.

Some snippets in case you can't read it. 
"... 
However, governments and central banks are also now taking Bitcoin seriously. This week has also brought news that Baidu, the Chinese search engine, would no longer accept Bitcoins as payment, after the People’s Bank of China ruled that Chinese banks should not process or insure Bitcoin transactions.
... 
It is too soon to bet that Bitcoin will be the hegemonic online currency, but there is plenty of time to bet on its competitors.
Where does this leave us? Foreign exchange analysts agree, mostly off the record, that Bitcoin is not worthy of being treated as a real currency.
Buying Bitcoins while their price is so bubbly is nothing more than a gamble. Investing in other online currencies, or in companies that can help the Bitcoin economy develop, looks like a sensible use of a venture capitalist’s money."

I love it, I've always wanted to get into stocks but being from a lower income family I never would of got the chance, I heard about mining started mining a bit and since I started I have one btc now and I'm trading daily and it's awesome! The price increases and decreases feels like a good game of poker. That's my sentimental attachment to Bitcoins :)

Some bots are flooding the market with a huge magnitude of orders to force a lag and people get scared of lag and sell off so the bot essentially lowers the price forcefully than buys a ton at the lower price while everyone's confused and panicked over the lag.

Eastern Europeans have always been on top of their game when it comes to underground and more niche computer programming and ideology, the fact they adopted Bitcoin so heavily and earlier than everyone else isn't too much of a surprise to me. I'm surprised Ukraine isn't on top behind Berlin and Moscow

Another thread on here confirmed it's just bull rumor spread to crash the price. Continue on as usual ladies and Gentlemen China is still on board. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:50:04
Businesses not adopting Bitcoin is the reason drops like this happen. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:11:46
This post is awesome, I don't even know op and I'm excited for him/her
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:52:42
Well the name does check out. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:40:47
Why did the Bitcoin cross the road?.... To avoid a crash.
... Sorry I'll leave it to you guys :(

Looks pretty cool I may try it out. Are the pictures of specific subjects/famous photos and paintings or are they just a picture of Joe blow and we have to guess what's in it?

I'm with this guy, I only have around one btc and I help all the way to the top and all the way down both ways yesterday and even though it's at 120 today it's still worth more than its value at the start when I got it so I'm still very happy. 
Bitcoin is humanities chance to ditch Bankers Greed for the good of us as a whole. Stocks and economies collapse because the people with the most money stop caring about everyone else who's at stake and move their money out so they don't lose. We all can change that now since we All have equal opportunity to own and trade Bitcoins at our own expense wish and desire. Let's stay human about this and not forget that together we can't be beat. I can't wait until more people are on board with btc. 
Can anyone recommend me a good trading site for a Canadian who mines and doesn't deposit money?

I've noticed bot-ery before on mtgox is there anyway they could stop it from happening ot at least make it so they can't make hundreds of 0.02btc sale? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:05:00
I'm having the same problem. I don't have much into it, only 1 btc which with this market I made into 1.6 in the past 5 days and it's definitely got me addicted now! I check the prices multiple times every ten minutes and my friends are getting worried about me, they all think I'm playing with imaginary stocks lol

I think this can explain the Concept and security of a wallet better than me :) 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:51:41
I bought at 191 woke up right when it was at 266 and instead of selling I'm like naaaaahhh it'll go up more. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:20:00
It will definitely go up again :) I just wished I had the funds to purchase more now so I can reap the profits from the definite eventual rise in price again! For everyone else buy now! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:51:33
I'm hoarding a small amount (0.5) in a wallet that I plan to hold on to until I'm 2140 :) 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:18:48
Sounds like a terrifying metaphor for big finance steamrolling us :s
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:16:28
Bitcoins you can securely store and trade en masse personally at home instead of having to rely on banks which is one of the main reasons they are there for consumers, also the transferring of any amount of funds is also done with Bitcoins online without the need of any institutional help and it's eons more secure. So you are basically your own bank/banker/trader now

I don't know why you are being down voted what you are saying is completely true. You have to pump money into it if you want it to keep its value
