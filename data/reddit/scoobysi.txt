Hmmm strange. If it’s not an obvious/stupid question you have completed the relevant lessons and answered the questions correctly? Sure mine appeared instantly once such things were passed. Have you had coinbase for a while and fully verified?

My memory has just kicked in. Rings a bell, think I only had to wait a day for most of them, one had already sold out or whatever the phrase would be. Hopefully you can get some free eventually

Nice. Not had chance to look properly but do you have to design it yourself on the site to get the logo etc?
@_date: 2019-07-30 17:42:51
The ones I got I did exactly that almost instantly. Do you have to wait now?

Lol. No one told me this blockchain stuff could be so fun
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:20:36
Insert joke here about being able to do contracts on blockchain. Lol

Any info on wallet/who? Not mt gox presumably?

If you want to just get btc with gbp binance jersey does such things

She’s definitely not pro bitcoin I’ll give you that
@_date: 2019-11-30 17:31:32
She is quite pro crypto generally though

Wirex works well for me
@_date: 2018-10-21 17:49:18
Would be funny to see “prepper” videos on YouTube adding btc to their backpack of .22 bullets and water. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 13:32:29
Apocalypse. Time to spend crypto on real gold and real bullets. A cheery read but let’s hope not. 
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:36:28
No problem. I’ve not tried it for purchases yet but did a test minor sale a few months back and worked flawlessly with perfect fee free market prices and same day funds into my bank. Got to love the uk banking real time gross settlement, er I mean we hate banks. Lol

I have used bittilicious which does have a fee built into their rates but takes as long as the btc verification once you’ve done a bank transfer, which is brilliantly quick in the uk. Last time I checked it was around 1 or 2 %? 
If you have time to set it up I do love my Wirex card for doing instant crypto purchases in gbp
Binance jersey have direct gbp to btc pairing, not sure how long the process takes mind.....

Jesus, just buy back then it’s only gone up a tiny bit currently
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:48:19
Depends which country/fiat you seek. For example there is a binance jersey which does gbp and euros for btc and eth.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:22:02
Worry not. It got annoying in the peak when it took hours to confirm

You have £12k this financial year capital gains tax free. If you’re not above this and the total amount your selling isn’t 4x greater than this or you are self cert then you don’t even need to declare it. Yeah baby the uk is great. I pity the yanks
Having bitcoin is treated as an asset, if you were paid it for work then it would fall within income tax laws but doesn’t sound like it here
@_date: 2019-12-25 20:09:51
Not sure I follow your confusion? Their point was if you put 1btc in Celsius you get 4% or whatever it is on btc but after say 2 years you have 1.1btc you only earn interest on 1btc, my way was taking the interest as cel coin exchanging it to btc and sending back to Celsius which then also gains interest on the 1.1+ btc. 
Ref not owning coins that is the fair point and what would make me nervous about such interest earning things
@_date: 2019-12-12 14:59:04
Good reviews although I didn’t find it that hard or painful to buy stamps and hammer them into some stainless steel from local diy place. Definitely the cheapest option and not that hard
@_date: 2019-12-25 15:36:34
If you want to effectively get compound interest and a better rate why not take interest in cel then send that elsewhere exchange to btc and send back to Celsius to also earn interest on that?
@_date: 2019-12-19 22:11:44
Your gain is from the selling of your account thing which was worth £0 and is now £5k, sounds pretty clear to me but talk to an accountant if you’re worried and want to spend a chunk of it. 
Check out the govt sites they’re not that scary or confusing. Just try and declare it online if you want to and it’ll still be the same thing. Was going to say unnecessary but if it gives you peace of mind maybe worth the effort
@_date: 2019-12-20 01:04:09
Exactly this, nothing suspicious at all

@_date: 2019-12-20 01:09:01
Balls it’s not an income it’s a company/thing you have grown. Capital gain. If it was multiples of 5k then yes they would care and you would be due to pay some tax. It isn’t.

Painfully funny seeing him in an amusing way
@_date: 2018-11-16 06:19:35
It means it’s the most popular, not the best. Liquidity is a big deal true but if others gain enough liquidity to be useful to a market with preferential cost and speed benefits then that potentially won’t last for ever........

@_date: 2019-01-06 17:34:28
Plus using conbase in the uk. Seems pointless. Lol
@_date: 2019-01-01 05:48:56
Agreed we don’t know. The one thing that worries me about 2019 is mt gox releasing their btc and presumably most people will sell pooping on the market. Last I recall that was talked about happening in early 2019, any more specifics on when that toxic situation will be completed?
@_date: 2019-09-22 07:44:08
Check moneygram they had minimal fees on Mexican transfers the other day where they were using xRapid and I don’t think there’s any liquidity issues with large volumes
@_date: 2019-09-22 20:07:57
I know nothing of the limits but worth looking into rather than presuming. Maybe worth asking the remittance companies just to see what they understand. 
The following link had some useful info but not total clarity:
@_date: 2019-09-21 21:49:51
Moneygram rates from Mexico were looking negligible  when I looked last week or are you looking to avoid touching usd for tax or other reasons?
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:36:22
And the average person should pay tax too so why should they have privacy from any earnings.
@_date: 2018-07-20 09:43:40
Don’t forget google are early investors in ripple the company though so even if not on the bleeding edge they are invested in crypto
@_date: 2019-09-01 16:32:22
Looks amazing
@_date: 2018-07-16 08:43:58
If it means google et al have to pay their taxes and pay for the nhs then good. Taxes due should be paid
@_date: 2019-09-22 06:58:48

Wirex card is really easy to convert to gbp, around a 2% fee as I recall
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:48:38

Not much help but buy from ledger then no such concerns
@_date: 2019-05-28 13:51:08
Worth reading some of his actual posts though as for example he used to post positive things about ripple which is very different to the modern maxi views. 
Love the above post about all flowers blooming. I do believe if satoshi was on another project he would still want the best for the original
@_date: 2018-12-14 10:13:33
I see your price only goes up when Craig dumps btc and pumps sv, maybe when he opens up his satoshi wallets then people will tremble. Till then lmao

There are theories out there for such things which would be considered blasphemy
@_date: 2019-05-29 17:04:30
Here’s what a quick search found from previous stuff. Sure some may question the validity but I like looking back when there was less hatred between the now often waring factions. Or maybe I’m just being delusional as I wish I’d found all this lovely blockchain stuff earlier. Good luck all I say. 
Nb think it’s the first link in first post which gets a response, ok not full on lust but certainly not the maxi stuff you hear nowadays

Surely the mining cartel argument faces all pow coins?
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:20:42
that is false, ripple only controls 27% of the recommended node list so er just nope

Time for the doge catchphrase of 1 doge=1 doge
I seriously doubt anyone would attach any value to when it was bought or held from. 
From a personal level we all feel it stronger riding the wave of poop that 2018 has been but that’s a lesson for ones self not a value for anyone else
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:31:51
Pretty sure mining uses more but either way the 2 wrongs are ok argument is surely flawed. 
I get the arguments of antibanks and companies which bitcoin promised but always found it ironical funny that such ideas which could be pigeon holed as anarchistic or hippy like should actually use so much energy when there are more efficient ways
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:23:14
Does anyone have a wallet tracker or know how much more btc the leech that is Craig has that he can dump and ruin the market to pump his sh!+ coin?
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:24:58
But it does ring alarm bells when btc dives, which cw could do by selling his sizeable stocks, and Sv rises which he also could do from his btc sales?
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:25:18
About a year ago a friend tried to wind me up by pretending he bought £20 worth of btc in 2011 on an old computer he’d forgot about, apparently he did think about it but never did it. After working out and then winding him up about how many millions he would have.  I did more research and got more and more intrigued. And that how I became a blockchain addict pretty much all in now have dca’d all the way down thru 2018. Still massively optimistic for the future and not losing any sleep......
