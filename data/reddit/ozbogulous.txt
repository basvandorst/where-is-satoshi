They moved the money in our account without consulting us. We haven't moved houses in 8 years, and we were contactable, but the money went without any letter or phonecall to warn us.

Took about a month including writing an official complaint letter and visiting  a city branch of the bank to confirm identity etc. And all that because we didn't touch our money for 3 years. HSBC in case you wonder.

Voted p2pool with 60+ shares

The last couple of days the PETA share price has climbed from 0.0008 to about 0.0014.

So according to the majority here:
- Bitcoin is for single men only
- If you have kids, stay away from Bitcoin
- Bitcoin will fail, don't put your money on it
- If you want to invest in Bitcoin, try to keep it to a minimum
I agree with OP. If you are happy to invest this kind of money into BTC, do it! There's only one today, you can never come back to this day. Believe in what you do, and accept any financial outcome with no regret, that's the spirit. I am with you OP.

Happened to me. Had to put a lot of effort in to get the $ back. Idiots.

Bitcoin - More than a currency alone

What is so amazing? I have had this app for months and it hasn't changed functionality, has it? This was possible already?
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:46:45
Trade it. And ride the waves.
@_date: 2014-06-14 08:36:27
Shill out guys.

So how do I buy these shares? I have BTC in my Havelock account... Not straightforward from there?
@_date: 2014-05-29 12:53:28
Oh no
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:55:56
Awesome, thanks
@_date: 2014-09-09 12:35:28
Infrasctructure guys!
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:30:58
Havelock/PETA is already applying the changes.

That's my point...

That's a bad looking chair.
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:59:36
This was strange
@_date: 2014-07-06 10:53:09
It's winter
@_date: 2014-07-12 23:09:04
Seems legit.

I've never mined but wanted to. Was too difficult to find a solution that would even break even after years. This (PETA shares) is a great way to be part of mining.
