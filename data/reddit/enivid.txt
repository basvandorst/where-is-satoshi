I know that definition, thank you. But how is the OP related to BTC faucets?

Despite the biased view and some dubious claims, that's actually an interesting read. Sheds some light on the ASIC manufacturing industry and potential problems crypto developers would be dealing with when trying to come up with anti-ASIC algorithm tweaks.

How does one invests in a BTC faucet? Isn't a BTC faucet a website that pays out a few satoshis for watching some ads?

The company might have asked Nakamoto's permission to share his email. Of course, it is just an assumption.

That depends on which derivatives are used in the ETF. The demand for ETF will spur the demand for the derivatives. That could be, for example, GBTC.

Which exchange are the volume numbers from?

Perhaps, but why call them "BTC facets" then? Anyway, I thought that this image was somehow related to bitcoin faucet websites, but it appears that it's completely unrelated.

Owning no bitcoin makes him less susceptible to personal attacks in edit wars based on [COI](

You are right. The hackers used the verified account of some Deutsche Telecom division and changed the name there. Apparently, Twitter does not remove the verification mark upon the name change.
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:03:25
It is not verified. It is a Unicode symbol in the name, not Twitter's verification stamp.

Looks like they are up again.
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:36:05
Their domain was.
@_date: 2013-05-01 10:22:17
Filtering by "btc" would also bring some relevant domains.

Thanks and nice! Now, what do I do with it? :)
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:02:13
One of the best explanations I've read. Thank you very much!

It takes so damn long for them to make a decision on bets... Do you know any alternatives to betsofbitco.in?

How is that feature of Bitcoin unique if other cryptocurrencies (e.g. Litecoin) do the same?
