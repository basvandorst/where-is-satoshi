 SAID HERE'S A SMALL CONSOLATION ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:13:27
*This is a scam, this guy can't even spell you correctly and is a redditor for a day*
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:27:52
*Give me free karma please*

Why store it on a cloud which can be compromised? Write it down and store it in a lockbox and bury a copy of it in your backyard/bank security box.
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:12:24
Not directly, but you can probably sell the BTC for gift cards then sell the gift cards for USD. As a minor you need access to accounts 18+ have access to.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:20:45
*Maybe you should stop watching Infowars and taking it so seriously.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:35:09
Use a different wallet than LB to transfer funds.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:15:01
A and B are correct.
Keeping it on 24/7 consuming electricity.
Not sure how to mitigate the software for the noise, it might be easier to put it in a sound proof box with ventilation.
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:13:22
*Your Bitcoin! Its Crashing!*
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:20:21
*LB has always been better for face to face trades. For online transactions exchanges are better.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:11:23
*hahaha this guy said reduce their value FOREVER, nah fuck off.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:24:31
*Bitcoin is not ready for mass adoption until Lightning is ready. CNN does not represent the majority of the world, and this is only a 'speculation' by them.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:21:40
*OP forgets that exchanges are in it to make money, if selling child porn was legal but still ethically wrong, Gemini would do it if the money was worth it.*
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:57:34
*Enjoyed the rear view mirror info but really I just came here to complain about a the thread*
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:08:09
*I'm talking out my ass and have no idea what is going on but please give me Karma for my low effort.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:44:45
*I'm a greasy neckbeard that strokes their beard everytime they think of ponies which also happens to be all the time.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:15:53
*OP fails to realize is that by adding "OVERSIGHT" from a 3rd party, it defeats the purpose of Bitcoin being decentralized and trustless.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:07:25
*I'm actually a troll/paid shill that tries to scare people and claims to see the greater picture*
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:14:27
*Name it Bitcoin Core to make the bcashers mad lol*
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:22:31
*I'm the CEO of Paypal and Cryptocurrencies threaten my company's business model so I better say something to warn people don't use it but not outright slam it because that can have repercussions*
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:38:00
*He is just trying to spread the FUD. Another crystal ball price reader.*
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:15:32
*This name is for translating your stupid bcash and dumb comments into entertainment, you post something stupid I translate it into what it actually is so enjoy it*

The private key can be known by more than 1 person hence this is your backdoor. Honestly just get the coins transferred to an address you make (which only you know the private key). It takes very little time to generate a wallet. 
Its foolish to buy some other wallet!
Its like the mystery boxes on eBay LOL
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:54:30
*This is a shitpost not because Bitcoin can go to a million but because you think these events will suddenly make it a million.*
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:24:20
You're afraid! Here's why you shouldn't be:
CHEAP COINS! This is your chance to gain more for your portfolio. Think of this as a buying opportunity that comes around once. Seriously, these coins were thought to be 'lost' forever and now the truth is coming out after all these years.
This is OPPORTUNITY!
You believe Bitcoin will be King in the future? You can't be afraid if you know it's gonna already WIN!
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:16:32
*Most people don't know about addresses, coins, Mt. Gox and its history, markets, and general stuff beyond the price of Bitcoin. Think of this as insider information in the Bitcoin community that has first chance to act before the rest of the world does.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:26:59
*Honestly nobody knows what is going to happen but it is a nice thought.*
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:50:33
*I'm a retard who doesn't know that Binance DID NOT get hacked and am possibly a shill/troll so please ignore me*
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:21:08
*Bitcoin.com is ran by Roger Ver, a notorious scamming man child who uses the name Bitcoin to promote Bitcoin cash or Bcash to pass it off as the real Bitcoin.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:19:42
*China does whatever the Chinese govt demands. Everything is under control, there are no accidental millionaires there. This is strictly a show of force the govt thinks it can show off.*
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:44:43
Activate, QUANTUM IMMORTALITY!
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:00:24
*The memes will continue until morale improves.*
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:55:37
*I'm a little bitch complainer that gets mad at a thread that I willfully entered and still got angry at. How could this be happening?*
See you next week.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:24:35
*I can't handle the price swings so I better move to Global what the fuck is that Intergold because I'm scared, please support me everyone.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:49:41
*This is about as likely as the other symbols being added to keyboards as well, unicodes work just fine, and most people just say Bitcoin.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:18:18
*No coiner here, I hope you guys suffer as much as I do because I'm an loser HAHA.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:13:45
*eBay accounts are notorious for being hacked and used by hackers to make exchanges then refunding and dumping the account. Bitcoin is only sent one way, be careful out there.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:25:49
*Anytime is a good time to buy Bitcoin now, if you believe the price can go to 50k and beyond what is stopping you from buying now?*
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:15:40
Never done it personally, maybe check r/bitmarkets or hit up craigslist. If you are low key about it you might be able to get away on localbitcoins.com for a meetup if you can find someone who will deal with a minor. Someone there will probably trade you cash for them skipping the gift card deal.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:59:35
*OP could just be a phony and trying to get into someone's wallet with Reddit help. Be careful who you help.*
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:19:10
You are correct to a certain degree, if you encode it well even a hacker won't know what it is for. Just inadvisable for new people using this type of security.
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:45:39
*Please thank me because my insignificant contribution is a BIG DEAL and I need the praise...please praise me PLEASE!*
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:14:48
*Implying more Bitcoins are being created, your analogy is garbage. Implying store of value was Bitcoin's sole purpose and people should hold life savings in an uncertain asset*
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:28:55
*I'm the actual retarded one who thinks it will reach $200 Bitcoins not understanding those coins will be eaten in buy orders very quickly*
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:23:47
*blockchain.info used to be okay in the beginning but is now notorious as a target for hackers, use a trezor or ledger if you are serious about hodling Bitcoin for the long term. blockchain is good for storing chump change.*
