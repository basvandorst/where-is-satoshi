1/ I started with wavetrend 3 years ago. I made money with the 4H timeframe, however I lost most of my profits due to poor risk-management and poor emotional control. I was too greedy and impatient lacked the discipline to cut losers immediately. Didn't knew about core trading concepts like scaling-sizing, risk-reward-ratios, risk management, institutional orderflow, marketdepth ratios, spoofing, iceberg orders, skewness, kurtosis, stophunts etc.
2/Nope, not worth $1000. Marketcipher is a copy from wavetrend however the settings aren't optimized for crypto. There are better alternatives out there like [marketcipher\_lightv1]( I don't use indicators can't give you a opinion on marketcipher\_lightv1 but he has pointed out that the default wavetrend doesn't work that well with crypto and that is correct.
3/Every newbie starts with indicators that is fine for building starting capital. However proper risk-management is crucial for keeping your profits. Learn risk management before even attempt at trading.
Another tip that I forgot to mention.
Learn how big players engineer liquidity.

watch the 144 EMA.
Just probability theory. Educated guesses nothing more. Mean/median reversion that is what you should be betting on. Knowing how to read profiles.  I can't predict with 100% accuracy that is impossible. I am making educated guesses. By default you have a 50% chance, the goal is to increase probability to 60-80%. I've been trading for years now I can feel intuively how price is going to behave just by reading the bellcurves how price will distribute based on kurtosis/skewness.
To confirm I trade I look at other factors, I am estimating the primary trend on weekly, closing price, amount of volume bought-sold per day, marketdepth ratios (pending limit-orders) and orderflow, divergences, long-short-ratios, funding rates in advance.
Majority of the ''tradingview analyst'' don't trade, they make money from ''signals''.  They are the ones giving T.A a bad rep.

wait for $6400 if that doesn't hold see you at $3800 could even dump lower but not lower than cost of production.
Due to supply halving you can expect a shake-out of epic proportions. Bitcoin always does the contrary to what everyone expects. People are expecting easy money, moon to 20k due to supply halving. Just look at litecoin halving. It mooned to $144 in June and dumped hard to $93  before the supply halving in August. Someone was selling the news. There is alot of fuckery in crypto. One should learn P.A not T.A and understand orderblocks how they act as a distribution zones. I am not trying to spread F.U.D this is just how this market operates.

And since halving is approaching I fear we might see a minor rally then a **massive dump**. The blame will be put a bullshit news story, just to make sure you're faith in crypto remains intact.
Minor-medium sized bitcoin rally before the halving, then a massive dump before the actual halving, blame will be put on bullshit news story.
Bitcoin will go sideways for a few months, lots of FUD will be spread from bloomberg, coindesk declaring that bitcoin is basicly overvalued, dead, bla bla.
Bigger players will sell into the supply halving news because the average idiot in crypto will believe bitcoin will automaticly moon to 20K due to supply halving.  Don't have to believe me...  just look at litecoin supply halving 2019, massive hype before the supply halving, mooned to $130-$140 in June, dumped to $93 the day after supply halving now Litecoin is sitting at $49 soon it will be under $32 just as I predicted in december 2018.
The market is contrarian.

Ask yourself this... If Teeka Tiwari knew what  he was talking about why didn't he recommend accumulating projects when BTC was hoovering around $3500.

Here are some stats to back up your claim which I think is true.
Trading is probability theory and extremely logical thinking. Probably 2% of the population excel in trading. INTP's , ENTJ, INTJ's the analyst types.
None the less there are patterns that are consistent on higher timeframes.
Price **always** briefly touches the 20 MA, apply a bollinger band and you know that this is true. So any deviation/dispersion from the average is a opportunity. If you combine this with highertimeframes and momentum indicators. The probability of success is very high. But it requires patience, discipline and faith in the math.
In a strong trending market, The daily rsi doesn't fall below RSI-50 if it falls below rsi 50 there might be exhaustion in the trend.  
If this week's opening price is lower than previous week opening price. You can expect a selling pressure at the start of the week.
Just a few examples that are consistent.

The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost. If the price is below cost, then production slows down. If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more. At the same time, the increased production would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price.   SATOSHI NAKAMOTO

Shall I take advice from a self-proclaimed retired trader, who is bullish because of some vague japanese candle stick formation that he has seen on the week chart and some news article that he has read.
The market isn't driven by news - fundamentals. Yeah they cause temporary event driven pumps, which are usually followed by massive corrections.
I took the most obvious short in history of trading and I think I'm experienced. 
If this short was obvious, why didn't you short it? Instead you deliberately chose to hodl like 90% of the mindless crowd who rely on hype, news, thinking bitcoin will magicly go up if more people buy into this ponzi.
Enough pretentious bs. Show me your bitmex-id and we can see your ROE%
Thing is there are tons of people on twitter, reddit, making calls but never backing it up with a 5-6 figure contract.
When I'm bullish, I back it up with a contract.
It's not about who has more money trading, it's about backing up your position with a actual contract that tied to real collateral.
I could ridicule you for your $7000 call but rather see you actually open a contract on deribit/bitmex with either 5-6 figures.

My call was short at $6490, I said we wouldn't break $6500
BTC topped at $6569 with a stophunt - difference = $69
Now we are heading towards $6380- range.
If I exit at $6380 , my profits will be around 0.5320 BTC. ($20,000 margin - 10 x leverage - 200,000 contracts.
If you went long till $7000, you would have lost money.

@_date: 2018-11-05 18:30:18
There is a volume price divergence. Price higher high - volume lower low. Which signifies a weak-trend.
To confirm a breakout - Price must be accompanied by higher volume to give the trend it's strength and conviction. The trend is weak and will result in short-selling. I opened up a short at $6490. Fill or Kill.
If this sounds to complicated for you. Turn on DMI and look what the adx is telling you on the day-chart.
Longs were skyhigh this morning like 58%, funding rates was around 0.4%. This is a deadgive away that the smart traders were preparing to short bitcoin.
Bitcoin will not break $6500 this year. We are seeing order absorption, every month lower low.
Volume profile traders know $6500 is P.O.C and can't be crushed with weak volume, only a stophunt can kill that resistance level.  I've seen P.O.C shift from $6800 to $6500, value is trading lower, market wants to trade lower.
Testing 6k over and over again doesn't make support level strong or stronger, in fact it will make it weak.
Swing-traders, scalpers are keeping 6k support level alive, incentive to buy at 6k will diminish over time if bitcoin continues to hit lower highs. This is called order absorption.
Lower highs generally leads to exhaustion till it breaks. My bet is that 6k will break and ''value'' area will continue moving lower.

**Bullrun based on NYSE's BAKT futures....this is your analysis?**
The futures are settled in cash not in bitcoin.
Just like CME, CBOE, they are settled in cash.
To affect the price of supply/demand dynamics of Bitcoin, the settlement have to be settled in Bitcoin.
The traders who will be trading on NYSE's BAKT futures are not buying Bitcoin, neither selling bitcoin but ''betting'' against the price of bitcoin in the form of contracts. To assume this is bullish.... it's neither bearish or bullish. It doesn't even affect the volume nor price of bitcoin.
CME, CBOE bitcoin futures, contrary what everybody believes they are not popular.
Market isn't driven by news, fundamentals.
The market is driven by technical analysis. Only liquidity and active trading can move the price of Bitcoin up and down. And, majority of the traders don't rely on fundamentals, news to make their trading decisions.
The market is still bearish, technically speaking if price remains under 200 moving average, it's considered bearish.

You just reminded me of something that I forgot about.
$6000 is generally perceived as the ''support line'' for btc.
There are many many pending retail limit/market orders are 6k.
Will  high net worth, speculative hedge funds, big market makers, etc get their orders filled at 6k? I highly doubt it.
Some wyckoffian-logic traders believe $6000-6500 as a accumulation range.
One thing I learned from trading, is this. If it's too obvious, it's likely a trap.
I view 6000-6500 trading range as massive chunk of liquidity. It is a big giant pool of liquidity.
If $6000 is perceived as support, Where do majority of the traders place their stops? Prob around  $5800-$5900-$5950
If I was a market-maker and I had to fill 250 million orders, I would initiate a stophunt, release all that liquidity into into my pending-limit orders between $5000-$5300.
If the market doesn't want to sell, I will force them to sell, use stops as leverage and pour all that liquidity in the range where I have placed my buy orders.

This is not fud, this is how the markets work.

You didn't call it, you had a 50/50 chance and you guess right. 
Bitcoin didn't pump above $6500 based on ''good news'' or the prospect of a bullrun.
There was stophunt, which triggered domino of liquidations wich lead to the pump to $6500
Source :   The liquidations statistics are available, see for yourself.
I mentioned specificly that $6500 wouldn't break with weak volume, only with a stophunt. Yes, resistance broke with a stophunt not with genuine buying demand.
The fact that resistance was broken with a short-squeeze (the market was pre-dominantly short)
doesn't imply that the market is pre-dominantly bullish on bitcoin. 
If bitcoin doesn't see any follow-through to push higher. The next squeeze will be a long-squeeze.
As long bitcoin stays under $6800, it's bearish. No amount of ''good news'' can pump it, so far every pump between $6800 and 6000 has been the result of either a long or a short squeeze.
I suspect exchanges who benefit greatly from the fees are partially responsible for the short-squeezes, just keep the markets alive.

Did it break with organic bullish buying volume? 
It broke through $6500 with a short-squeeze. This implies that the market wasn't bullish on bitcoin. In fact majority of the traders were shorting bitcoin before a stophunt was initiated by someone or a group of wealthy someones.
Price broke through $6500 with a stophunt, if that is bullish to you, feel free to open a long-position with 10-100x leverage.  If you are bullish and if you actually believe that we are in a bullmarket, then do it.  You could potentially make 0.06 btc  if bitcoin moves up $50 with $100000 contracts

$6000 is not support if we see lower high and drying up of volatility.
Ask yourself this. Who is moving and shaking the markets? The people who just hold or the people who actively trade and provide liquidity to the markets Who is actively moving the price lower - higher?
The answer is the trader.
The incentive to go **long** at 6k will slowly diminish over time if  we see continued order absorption and reduced liquidity which will result in lower-highs.
In otherwords, the incentive for me to open up a long at $6000 will dimish if the resistance (ceiling) is shifting lower every month. Right now $6400 = POC.
I've seen the Point of controll shift from $8600 as POC to $6400. I've been keeping track of the P.O.C for months.
It is given you hint that the market wants to trade lower, the perceived value of bitcoin is shifting lower.
Full-time traders (day-traders, scalpers, swing-traders are keeping $6000 alive, without these people , 4-5k would have triggered mass suicides among the clueless hodlers.
