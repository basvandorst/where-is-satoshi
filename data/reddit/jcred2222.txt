"All intents and purposes"
@_date: 2015-06-09 01:58:41
Wow. How difficult is that to do before all these announcements? If the identity is not verified does that not throw the whole purpose of this into question? Isn't the point to prove ownership in a publicly verifiable way?

My wife used to say "play it by year" until I met her. You're welcome

i guess that's an unfortunate side of this. But computerized voting introduces two outcomes: vote rigging in the background with current machines, or vote buying in the foreground with the blockchain.
What kinds of voting fraud exist now? And does computerized voting really change any of that or just make it more visible? I guess greater minds have already contemplated this at length.

Nice try, GAW

Funny, my changetip wallet is protected by my reddit account which does not have 2FA. Any way to enable it? Security tab under Preferences reveals little.

Test? @_date: 2014-11-07 04:33:14
Quadrillion bits?
THE FUTURE IS NOW!!!
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:18:24
Just signed up and funded $10 from my bread wallet. My god, the future is now. 
2 internets @_date: 2014-11-18 14:01:30
The same way you prevent it now - you don't. But at least machines wouldn't be putting in your vote for the opposite person. Fucking Diebold.

Looks like it was written by an eighth grader.
That may be giving it too much credit though...
Whitepaper, ha, just because the paper is white.
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:49:25
Wow, read the comments. They blew the launch for sure.
Hey, let's release an integration before testing it! Fuck, all these Bitcoin companies look so mickeymouse in comparison to just about any other financial company out there. I know it's growing pains they haven't been around as long blah blah blab... But come on, do some goddamn testing first.
@_date: 2014-11-07 03:00:25
yes the one-off hit is not so bad. But consider those that will be receiving tons of tips. In the future they may pile up a million bits before even knowing it to be able to even move it, who knows
Changetip should let you specify your own wallet address to deposit tips to. My 2 bits.

Here's how I sell my vote now: "hey wanna buy my vote?"
Here's how I do it with Bitcoin: "hey wanna buy my vote?"
I suppose nowadays I could say I'm going to vote for whoever and just.. Not.

Ding ding ding! It's just a grand experiment. Some people are actual investors or traders and have tons of money, but just as many or more are literally using just what they can afford to lose, because they know it could go to zero and are ok with that.
As with anything, some people are stupid and putting in money they can't afford to lose as well. They're probably going bonkers all day long...
I find it interesting but I don't really care where it ends up. Zero? Fine. Lots? Well I hope more places take it because I won't change it back for cash.

Bought .25 the other day... Over 2BTC now. If it hits below $150 I might plunk down to make it an even dozen. Yeah, thanks for the discounts
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:30:41
Of course, the price is depressed to 12 month lows and then the show starts once the big boys get in cheap.

Aren't they practically the same thing? You have to sign in to your online banking to make the transaction; if you've got online banking you most likely can do both.
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:12:55
AaaaaaaahHahahaha!!! 
"Hey everybody, ON THE PLANET, stop making transactions for just, like, 30 minutes please!!"
@_date: 2015-07-05 23:02:54
Quickbt if you can use interac e-transfer. For credit card, go to the ATM, take cash off credit card, deposit to bank account, use quickbt 
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:53:00
Huh. Learn something new every day. When I buy with QuickBt it shows me a page with all kinds of banks (TD included) and you click the logo, login, confirm and on you go. Maybe just needs to be enabled in your account

Up to 1/10th the retail price now... Might take a stab at it.

What happened to the auction?
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:24:58
Any decentralized exchanges you can put it up on?? Ill give you 1btc for it w/ shipping
@_date: 2015-10-06 22:23:48
What the shit? It's a warrant canary, not a canary warrant. They can't even get that right?

The only parts of the banking system that are exposed enough to DDoS are their public websites and maybe employee login sites/VPN servers. Anything important is on networks not accessible from the Internet.
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:34:23
That newspaper is definitely blue and black.
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:53:26
That would have shown online since Cloudflare would have responded. Unless I'm incorrect?
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:23:21
Yep back up for me now too
