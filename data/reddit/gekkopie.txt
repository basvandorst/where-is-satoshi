Still no proof, just someone's speculation

So improve it. You can edit Wikipedia too.

What would stop them all from colluding to get the coins for significantly under market value? It's not like the USMS imposed a reserve.

Show me your proof of this so I can pawn it off as my own and win a nobel

Is this for real?

This is only assuming you're using a brute force method to crack the key. Since counting to 2^256 was mentioned it's implied that you're using an algorithm that runs in exponential time. A quantum computer can run algorithms in polynomial time that would take a binary computer exponential time. Those two things are worlds away from each other, for those wondering. So, while this infographic may be true for binary computing it doesn't hold up when quantum computing is brought into the discussion.
