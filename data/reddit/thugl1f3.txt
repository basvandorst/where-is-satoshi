Bitcoin is a eugenic culling strategy.

Free from Talmudic usury
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:48:08
Its officially through the 200 wall on MtGox despite their manipulation.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:42:44
Someone was alleging there were 'thousands' of 0.1 BTC transactions spammed in to clog it up, but I'd have to see a hardcore review of the data before I agreed with that.  
The real DDOS was its hoarding naive user base who were smothering the actual bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:03:50
yes, when it corrects for the entire time its been going parabolic.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:25:13
you do realize the world financial system is completely centralized, and there is only one group you cant criticize by name. just look at the names of the people who run these organizations. lol.

$249 at bitfloor?

Is that why everyone was encouraging me to buy btc all morning, and ride this out? lol
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:50:17
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:09:08
why? because your a soulless gambler?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:47:19
why dont you research fundamental economics and the dynamics of what youre investing in before you throw money at it.  reread that sentence until it sinks in.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:09:12
So is every line on the chart below that a single transaction?  For example there is a 465BTC sale on there, is that a single person cashing out?
edit its 23 min lag now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:44:40
it had been going parabolic for three months. thats 'why' this happened.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:38:34
Its going to stabilize over time.  Anyone who is genuinely interested in bitcoin needs to grow the economy itself by offering goods and services, not so much abstract speculating.  The deflation over the last few months has been inhibiting the actual market.  Why would anyone spend coin when it was deflating so fast?  This bubble was actually very bad for the bitcoin economy itself.  Deflation would also inhibit businesses in many ways if they were getting loans in btc or buying supplies in btc (as they will in the future).
Hopefully the derivatives market will grow and there will be more people betting against its deflation in the future.
I've honestly yet to find anyone discussing all the fundamentals of this market.  They are either extreme skeptics or anarcho capitalist apostles.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:55:10
what makes you think it was a ddos
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:52:18
how hard do you think high frequency trading is for them when their market has a 70 minute (and counting) lag?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:25:18
62 minutes and counting. 
how many of those are sell orders, do you think?  at least now bitcoin can go back to a medium of exchange, instead of being hoarded.  no one lately would rationally buy bitcoin and spend it on weed when they were deflating so rapidly.
how long did you think it would go parabolic?
edit: and bitcoinity is 404 again.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:31:52
True, its 502.  My point is this isnt a smart place to put your money if you have no grasp of economics or the bitcoin economy's fundamentals.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:20:22
3600 seconds = 60 minutes. and counting.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:53:24
its your money, pal.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:22:17
what does this picture tell you?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:06:06
most bitcoiners cant handle that, but it's true. next support is at 150-175 and after that its sagan-knows-where.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:28:20
there is definitely a feedback loop between the two, but there is also a feedback between deflation and speculation (not actually buying crap with your bitcoin).  Why would you buy something today when it is 20percent off tomorrow and maybe 50 off next week?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:07:47
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:02:22
I think its important to keep in mind that there are a number of other local and virtual currency models.  The problem with everyone in the bitcoin community I've encountered so far is that they aren't much smarter than the average person on the street-- its just geeky betting for them. No discussions of economic theory, very few unbiased voices.  So in a way, i think the bitcoin community is an alpha release of what digital currencies will be.  I think in the long term it will stabilize for various reasons (mature central banks, extremely secure spending systems, diversified markets, extensive derivatives trading).
I found this guy's opinions on bitcoin at the very least, interesting, because he is an advocate of other currency concepts
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:07:13
That moment you realize everyone is in the market to screw everyone else.

high frequency insider trading must be easy when the resolution of the market is a half hour.
edit: i cant get the mtgox or bitcoinity graph lol
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:50:24
im on bitcoinity its at 108usd, 730sec lag if its not lying
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:08:21
No way man.  MtGOX has our back theyre pegging the price at 200.
Seriously though, I called it-- after it broke 230 there are no supports before 175, with the last one at 150.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:10:18
I'll wait for rock bottom.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:14:41
Indeed, the high deflation has realistically been stifling the market.  What rational person would spend btc when its deflating so quickly?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:15:40
Yeah, I honestly haven't found much good discussion of bitcoin around
These charts could be something interesting to keep an eye on--
Other than that you might go consult various other economic discussion forums because everyone disagrees on what money is and how economies should be designed.  I'm sure most of them have had some discussions on bitcoin.
