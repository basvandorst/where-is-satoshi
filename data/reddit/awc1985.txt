Fuck that guy for stating the obvious!

Yes! As a citizen of a third world country! I don't want my hard work to be used as payment for the mistakes my government had in the past!

Any support is good for me.

I have always been saying the internet will always win. Elections helped a lot by internet misinformation. Technical skills, classics anything you want to learn is on the internet - if you want to learn something why pay for an expensive piece of paper?

It just hurts like hell when you bought at 19k

Every time you see an opportunity, Shit follows.

I just realized the person drawing is a dick/phallic symbol.
@_date: 2019-03-31 13:34:29
Was buying until 16k so yeah.. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 09:08:05
There are some ties that you wear to say fuck you.

Shop looks like street wear also. Good target market.

I bet this guys coffee tastes good.

Will it possible to create smart contracts which are similar to credit cards, just without the "membership" and interest? Some huge financial institution must back it up right?

If faster tech can be developed, is it possible to come sooner?
@_date: 2019-10-09 08:36:23
Triad probably smashing those too
@_date: 2019-10-15 08:45:03
Ah the good old December '17, where all our hopes where built and eventually crushed.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:18:30
I was buying at 16 k. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:52:42
So should I still buy at 10k?
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:14:46
Yeah better off to pay with Eth.
@_date: 2019-02-26 07:16:56
That nurse meme isn't so far away...
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:11:31
Yep I hope it does this. Discounted BTC! 
@_date: 2019-12-20 10:32:07
Good only if most merchants accept bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-02 01:58:45
When Bitcoin pushes through we won't need to do that anymore. It's just insane that we already have the technology and most people just don't want to use it.

I'm thinking of paying my sister in the UK with BTC, any reputable exchanges there for UKP?

We're just afraid to call it. The bubble has popped.

Is the bearish market because of the BTC of Mt. Gox getting shorted?

Just listen to podcasts man and put stop losses.

Everyone is telling me lately, good riddance.
@_date: 2019-01-11 07:48:23
I wish people would just realize how convenient it is to pay with crypto. Most credit card carriers here have 3.5% interest and $50 to $100 annual fees. Bouncing forex is also wasteful
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:47:10
How does bitcoin prevent inflation?
@_date: 2019-01-24 15:33:17
For a 5 month account this is very possible.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:30:41
As for now I just see BTC as a means of trading to other forms of crypto as BTC is quite expensive to move. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:14:16
Are CME contracts the one driving the prices down? How do people make money out of this?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:26:28
I just dollar cost averaged until 16k at that point the cost of transferring to exchanges were insane and not worth it anymore.
@_date: 2018-07-12 09:23:21
I have a feeling we will be floating in this pit for a while until the 20.5 million mark and everyone will want to buy again.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:28:03
