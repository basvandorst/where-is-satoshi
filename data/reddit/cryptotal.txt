He is incoherent and making up shit. Sad to see such a bright mind fade so much. Would have been fun to trade with the guy that broke the Bank of England.

Sounds like they should start mining then. Short trip for Chinese machines.
Also not if, but when, and then it's if they're able to hodl until the next run.

The fee market is inefficient now.
It will get smarter. High fees ensure that.

Same with AMZN

Shitcoins are good for experimentation
Shitcoins become real coins when a successful experiment produces significant non-speculative flows
Ethereum has not crossed that bridge yet...perhaps STOs could do that, but not yet
