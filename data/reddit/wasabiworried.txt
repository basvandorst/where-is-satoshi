When mixing 10 BTC, it would be ok if there was only some initial change in the first transaction that breaks up the 10 BTC.
I could handle that as a toxic output.
Unfortunately, wasabi creates up to dozens of new change while remixing, like breadcrumps chainanalysis can follow.
When i pointed this out, my post got deleted at the wasabiwallet subreddit.
And saying "fuck you" to others who point it out does not really reassure me that the wasabi devs know what they are doing.
I have no interest in attacking them personally, but watching an interview with them, they said "i don't understand the question" more than anything else.
Wasabi might be nice in theory, but recommending it to newbies is really dangerous IMHO.
The last mix of each 0.1 BTC chunk might have the 1/100 anonymity set, but since we are talking about 100x 0.1 BTC if you mix 10 BTC, all those change output wasabi creates whenever it has to refit the amount to the current mixing amount, i would absolutely not be surprised if it can be deanonymized with near 100% certainity.
Maybe the wasabi devs can reply to this concern in detail, instead of deleting posts and writing "fuck you" to others?  
If we should not touch ANY wasabi change at all, this is a really stupid way to bloat the bitcoin blockchain.  
And even then, with 100's of 0.1 BTC in a wallet, people will create so many patterns that chainanalysis can pick up.  
I would love to have a decentralized mixer working, but wasabi does not seem to be something i can trust.

Clarification? All he said was "fuck you". That topic would be worth a long podcast with some people who put years of thought into coinjoin theory. Until that happens, i don't trust either wasabi or samurai at all. Just because it is dezentralized and nice in theory, does not mean people should trust any random developer.
