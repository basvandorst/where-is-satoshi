His first tweet has nothing to retract: he laments that they were irresponsible enough to put this man in the spotlight when he (potentially) is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, even not having definite evidence that he's indeed **the** Satoshi.
In his second tweet he highlights that she didn't put enough effort to disprove her thesis, which would be the responsible thing to do. Comparing their writing differences, as many are doing, seems a convincing counterargument that she explores very wrongly.

He's only accepting donations through his e-mail, which is kind of cumbersome to those like me who can't pledge a full banca but would like to help.
"How to donate" should be really in the top of the page: I had to search for it in the FAQ when the main purpose of the site is to get people to help! Also, suggest him to setup a QR Code for Bitcoin donations, so anyone may send to him easily.
I guess anonymous donations may fudge his nice table of pledgers and boat names, but "Bitcoiners" and "FV Magic  would be an acceptable compromise :)

That' sad :(

Yeah, good luck proving he is Satoshi. He may actually be and still sue, and I hope he'll do it.

I can't find a single argument in this article to disagree. Amara's law rings pretty true, as well as "Inevitability is not a strategy": we must work harder for adoption, not only expect that bigwigs see its value and embrace it.

Yes, it is a full node that relays transactions, but of course it does not mine. Just check if you are actually receiving and sending - ie, port 8333 open, more than 8 connections - or just receiving. Also, with such uptime you may be a connection of blockchain.info, and appear in this [sweet graph](

I guess the idea is Coca-Cola® interesting, but this should be suggested as a plugin to Reddit... and some control (Xanax®) would need to be taken to avoid a fuckfest of branding everywhere.

I appreciate your view of "Good gets Better, Bad gets Worse". In a way that is a law of Nature, as Pareto found in the beggining of the 20th century with "rich-get-richer", and has been rediscovered in network science with preferential attachment - more connections are made to those highly connected.

That's a common feeling when people hear about decentralized networks. Still, you should know that the internet itself is decentralized - routers don't answer to anyone when they decide to pull a fiber and connect to another router. They trade routing tables and offer some, but not excessive, guarantees on packet delivery to each other. 
Still, my comment will travel from a university in Brazil, pass through dozens of internet providers, reach Reddit servers in the US and be displayed for you and all other interested ones with almost 100% guarantee*. A plane that flies beautifully, yes.
*Except for the occasional "Ow!"

Sorry, I don't know how your education system works. I've just graduated at computer engineering and am doing my Masters in it.
The best introduction to the subject is "Linked: the new science of networks" from Albert-Lászlo Barabási. It's a popular science book that hooked me into it. I've also taken "Networked Life" and "Social Network Analysis" in Coursera; other courses may be available.

As a complex network researcher, small-world networks aren't that interesting, because almost all networks have the property to have small average geodesic distance (ie, in general there's always a short path between two nodes). Only structured networks (like the third one) lack this property.
The second network looks like a scale-free network, where there are large hubs which intermediate most of the traffic, and are in a sense the weakest link: if they fail, the network falls with them. The internet routers are organized like this, which has severe consequences for security.
A more interesting characteristic to look for in network security is assortativity, ie, the property that nodes connect preferentially to nodes similar to it. Social networks present this property naturally (shy people connect to shy people, extroverted connect to extroverted, _preferentially_), but technological networks, as the internet, show the opposite effect.
The Bitcoin network is overlayed over the Internet, so it will share some of its flaws. Still, it may be possible to tweak its protocol to create resilient connections as a whole, although that is fairly complicated when you don't have a bird's eye view of it...

If you're gonna do it by hand, just use all that ink to find a flaw in SHA and do not publish it. Then your ROI will surely be much higher.

Trying to phrase it in order of relevance...
"**Bitcoin** make **people** leverage **time** and **money** with simple **transactions**. The **btc currency**'**s** **value** relies on an alive **market**, that is growing **year** after year. **Buy coins**! **Thanks**."

They may have seen my recent suggestion, although I doubt it because they didn't implement mBTC, uBTC or satoshi as coin denominations.
This is the feedback I gave two weeks ago after trying the query "convert 1.58 mBTC to BRL". Maybe you can reuse it as further feedback.
BTC is the common denomination of Bitcoin, an electronic currency.
The currency is divisible untll 1e-8, having different fractional denominations: mBTC (1e-3), uBTC (1e-6) and satoshi (1e-8).
There are several trading markets of Bitcoin, using different currencies (USD, BRL, CNY, etc.) and different conversion values.
The largest BTC-USD markets are Mtgox and Bitstamp, and localbitcoins offers a wide range of conversions.
My query would like to compute the current conversion between 1.58 mBTC to BRL, either checking a direct conversion or converting BTC-&gt;USD and then USD-&gt;BRL.
