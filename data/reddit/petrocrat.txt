Actually, most of the QE money from the FED is sitting in Federal Reserve Bank Accounts which are like checking accounts that banks have at the FED... Thi is why there are record excess reserves right now. All that QE is sitting in the excess reserves, which is why it is inert and not causing inflation. If the banks suddenly decide to lend it all (which they could do at any moment) then inflation will kick in.

Coinbase keeps ~90% of its coins in cold storage already (for security reasons)... but this implies that it only needs 10% of its bitcoin holdings to meet transactional demand. This is already akin, or a precursor in a way, to fractional reserve banking operations. Bitcoin banks with a large fractional reserve of ~50% rather than 5-10% of traditional banks are probable.

I agree with you about that (it's a classic mmt principle after all). 
I should provide the disclaimer that my suspicion of peak oil being the cause of lack of economic growth is just that... a suspicion.
If the government were to increase spending or decrease taxes I would expect growth to return at least to a modest degree, but even then I suspect that growth would only last another two decades at most due to oil production constraints.

It's not from wikipedia, it's data from the federal reserve just posted to wikipedia.
Here's the summary from that picture above:
*Excess reserves in the U.S., 1930-January 1, 2009*
*source: Federal Reserve System, St. Louis Fed research graph: Excess Reserves of Depository Institutions (EXCRESNS), Monthly, Not Seasonally Adjusted*
You said this up-thread, which is I think the crux of your misunderstanding:


This tells me that you think the QE money is going to the commercial balance sheets of the banks, which is not true. QE goes to the reserve accounts of banks which are specialized checking accounts that banks have at their local FED branch. The commerical balance sheets are where households have checking accounts with their bank and also where banks originate loans and the associated demand deposits. 
Reserve accounts and commercial balance sheets are two separated accounting bins.
When the fed is buying up securities they buy the collateral against loans and when the banks get rid of this collateral it can help the commercial balance sheet indirectly because the loan is essentially defaulted on at this point (which does remove the debt but by virtue of the default not the FED) and the collateral against the loan is what is now being transacted. 
But the money the FED paid for it goes into the banks' reserve account. And the collateral (which you call debt) hasn't gone away, the FED is now holding it. The FED has the intention of eventually selling it back to the banks to in exchange for the money in those reserve accounts. That is the so-called exit strategy... the plan to soak up all those excess reserves some day in the future.
Of course the problem lies with the fact that the FED exchanged full value for the mortgage-related collateral it bought, and in the future it is unlikely that any bank will pay an equal amount to buy that collateral back. This will cause the FED to be unable to "soak-up" all of the excess reserves that it issued in the last 5 years.
There are some ideas to deal with this relating to bond issuance, but it's unproven at this point.

Income tax is one of the worst methods of taxation since it discourages productive labor (seriously a crazy insane stupid policy), governments will adapt (in fact bitcoin might be the catalyst to get gov to finally have a sane taxation policy by taxing "bads" and not "goods"). 
Let's fund government with better mechanisms (not all of these of course, enough to fund gov and no more): land-value tax, tariffs/excise, sin tax, taxes on [resource severance]( pollutant emissions tax, waste disposal tax, tax on children above some child-quota (for the least intolerable population throttling method I know of), road tolls, just to name a few which bitcoin transactions don't have any extraordinary ability to circumvent.

What I mean is that because transactional demand is such a small fraction of the exchange's holdings, the opportunity is feasibly there for an exchange to be creating deposits in excess of the amount of bitcoins they actually hold. (edit: And they wouldn't really run an appreciable risk of being called to have all of their holding redeemed at once.)
This is because the amount of bitcoins being redeemed (i.e. removed from the internal exchange ecosystem) is far less than the amount of bitcoins being exchanged within the exchange ecosystem. This requires off-blockchain transactions for this to actually take place. But the more we see merchants (i.e. Overstock) partnering with an exchange like Coinbase, which allows for off-blockchain settlements of trades, the more I predict we will see a simulacrum of "fractional reserve" bitcoin banking.
(not that I'm saying Coinbase is doing this)

I agree with you. I personally believe that loan growth has halted because loan demand has halted. The only piece of data that makes me believe that perhaps a sliver of the loan growth decline is on the supply side is the banking opinions I see that mortgage rates are too low to justify a 30 year liability.

I think this should be more the focus than undermining governments. Banks aren't liked by either political side right now, and for damn good reasons which are easy to understand. 
The current form of US government still has supporters, and the case against it isn't as much of a slam dunk, because that case is extremely complex.
But notice, that if people get on board with Bitcoin due to the anti-bank sentiment, then they unwittingly will destabilize government, because the institutions in our society who can get bank reserves from the FED discount window, are practically a government franchise.

Here's what I wrote back to him:
re: My article submission never showed up under the 'new' tab
to technology_mod sent 2 minutes ago
I believe it is a technology article. It was explaining the programming language called script behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.
    Every Bitcoin transaction is defined in part by a bit of code, called a script, written in a programming language called Script. The script in one transaction defines how the next user can access the coins. In a conventional transaction, the script specifies the hash of the public key that is needed to spend the coins next, and demands a signature from the corresponding private key.
It is also drawing the analogy about the structure and nature of bitcoin to the Internet back in the '90s.
    I think we are better served by fleshing out the extremely apt Internet:communication::Bitcoin:finance analogy
    Most of Bitcoin’s critics are making a category error. They are taking aim at Bitcoin the currency, when in fact Bitcoin is much more than a currency, in the same way that the Internet is much more than the telecommunication services that preceded it.
This article was already posted to r/bitcoin. I thought it was appropriate for r/technology since it was analyzing the computing technology which operates bitcoin's blockchain.

You caught me speaking hypothetically, as in, if some unknown wildcard reason caused all those reserves to be tapped for lending out, then we would see inflation. I personally think the reserves will just sit there inert indefinitely. My prognostication is we are drifting to deflation just like how Europe is basically already there.


Banks do set their own mortgage rates except they do so with the federal funds rate as background influence, since a commercial loan would never go below the feds fund rate. When the feds funds rate was 5% years ago, banks set their rates around 8% or something. And they competed with each other for business so one bank would set the rate at 7.5% to attract customers. 
Since the fed funds rate is ~.25% now. Banks competing for loan customers must drive their rate down to ultra low rates to beat out the next bank, that's why we saw mortgage rates in the 2% range earlier. At that rate many banks say "fuck it" its not worth mortgage lending on a 30-year risk at that rate, so they get out of that market. Many banks leaving the mortgage market has loosened the competition there, which is why mortgage rates are drifting back up a bit to 3% range.
The banks that leave mortgages gravitate to either shorter term loans (car loans), where a low rate is ok due to the fast turn around on loans... or government secured and rate-fixed loans (student loans), where competition for customers doesn't drive the rate down since the rate is legislated.

* Just a starting point: Let's say "dead" is coin-age &gt; 2 years.

This would only be implemented when the block-chain reward is zero or virtually zero.
* A stable constant money supply is nice and mildly deflationary, which is probably benign. A decreasing money supply is not nice and has malign economic effects, due to increasing difficulty of exchange.
* Why miners? They were the only group I could think of that seemed fair to distribute to, they are maintaining the network, thus providing some value so... what other group might the dead coins be distributed to?

(sorry for reviving a dead thread but...)
I thought in POS the miner had to annihilate the coin age of the stake to mine a block, which means they do have something at stake: the coin age... The miner could theoretically split coin age in two to mine two blocks simultaneously, but since the (number of coins)*(coin age) is a factor in the mining function that reduces the probability of finding a nonce? I could easily be misinformed, which is why I'm desperate to ask this even on a dead thread.
But as for "going meta" and trying to prevent a double spend on the proof of stake. If that problem were resolved by using coin age, I don't see how going meta is a protocol-breaking hurdle.

And this is why we are seeing record excess reserves, because banks like totally risk-free 0.25% return.


The spread may be the same but on a lower total value due to the crash in housing prices. Retruns should be getting back to where they were now that housing prices are recovering and approaching pre-crisis levels in some places. I think you're instinct is right, that the appetite for banks to lend will return because the returns will be back to where they were. But the returns were not what banks were used to when housing prices were low, despite the FED adjusting Fed Funds rates to keep the spread about the same.


Banks are still cautious of lending to low-credit score customers after 2008. Many banks won't lend to customers below 720 in credit score, which is crazy I know, but that is their policy right now in some banks.
Now 6 years out, there are some banks venturing into the low to mid 600 credit scores for loans and they are getting slightly better rates, but more importantly they are the 10 year fixed rates, with adjustable rates after that, gambling on future fed funds rates. Deja-Vu.

Yes that is odd. We have definitely seen a shift to a new normal. I think the ultimate reason that banks aren't finding "bankable projects" (to use the words of the IMF) that they feel comfortable lending to is due to lack of economic growth. Without economic growth, then basically any interest rate, no matter how low, is simply impossible for debtors to service, no matter how good their intentions may be. So banks are waiting to see if economic growth returns.
I think the reasons that economic growth has stalled (and won't return) fall outside of polite economics conversation.

I can stomach some argument that even State taxes are illegitimate, since some states are too huge to be a real community, but this is some grey area in terms of whats the proper size, etc and so there is some room to disagree.

I believe that because of the data on it. Banks have record excess reserves, which means they are not lending as much as they legally are allowed to...
[“a typical American family” with a credit score in the low 700s is “being left out”: that’s a very long way from subprime](
Basically, banks aren't lending for mortgages because they can't make a decent profit at current rates on a 30 year loan.
And take a look at [household debt]( we are in a major deleveraging phase. I cna't say that this is actually because banks won't lend to them or because households don't want to further leverage up. But the effect is the same: Excess reserves pile up untapped.

(just a heads up: I'm not disagreeing with you but..)
Given proper parameters, a poisson's distribution predicts the rate of redemption of a given note. So functionally speaking "backing" a note with a % proportional to the poisson's rate is observationally equivalent to backing the note 100%
I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm just saying banks have observed that there is no easy way given normal operations to distinguish (as an observant outsider) between 100% backing and "poisson's rate backing," but it's more profitable to do poisson's rate backing so of course all banks eventually drift to that to stay competitive
And then they conveniently neglect black swan events. Which is when the dirty laundry of their actual %backing is revealed, albeit too late.

But you can have demurrage that doesn't kick in for like &gt;2 years of coin-age at a single address. That way it is only really catching truly lost coins. A saver can just shuffle their coins to a new address every two years to avoid demurrage charges.

It's not as if these banks will suddenly become issuers of bitcoin. That is the power that banks abuse: endogenous money creation, i.e. creating US dollars ex nihilo during lending. They can't do that with bitcoin. They would be on the same level playing field as you or I when they handle bitcoin.

Perhaps I should have said they would "finesse" it. What I mean is large bitcoin holders may take advantage of situations where desperate bitcoin users' have immediate demand for bitcoins and are unable to use another currency on short notice.
Consider that person A may decide they want to make a purchase of something that they don't have enough bitcoins for from person B. They go to one of these people with lots of bitcoins, person C, and borrow them to complete their purchase, but they only borrowed a contract that is redeemable in bitcoins at some later maturity date. Assuming person B accepts payment in that form, now you've suddenly got bitcoin-backed notes potentially floating around. Now there is bitcoin debt, perhaps earning interest, in the bitcoin economy.

You really misunderstood something along the way here. I said 60 million people die annually, assume half die without disclosing their private key.... not half of the world dies every year...

lending is only essential in a debt based monetary system.

This is very much the type of question I am raising. Some people may try to initiate a form of derivatives of bitcoins with the idea that it can make it more dynamic and organically increase the M0 of bitocin to accommodate economic growth. But they overlook that then there would be an issuer of the derivatives, which constitutes central management like you point out.
@_date: 2013-12-30 06:29:15
This is the real reason... A deflation-tending currency will not encourage lending since people will realize that being on the debtor side is masochistic... and if it becomes dominant, then voila the lending industry just got destroyed. A lot of plutocrats like making money without contributing their labor, just lending instead.

can the entire economy function on one mBTC? one µBTC?
Because the problem I described there is a decaying function to an assymptote of zero....
edit: [Well, I'm glad your thinking ahead.]( But seriously that just [distracts from the point](

In order for it to be hyperinflationary, wouldn't there have to be some entity that will purchase all of the outstanding debt (including the ridiculous amounts of derivatives contracts) in the credit markets?
The FED is currently doing that, but I don't see any other entity that would purchase all of that debt going forward. The point when the debt no longer has a buyer is when the defaults occur. Isn't such a systemic default scenario deflationary?

Not under the current US Constitution they can't...
US Constitution basically forbids capitation taxes. Those are taxes basically just for existing (i.e. a per capita tax). So they would have to do more than change the law, they would have to pass an amendment.. good luck with that.
Technically they could levy such a tax if apportioned by each state's population, but this is so complex to administer that it is a near perfect barrier to deployment.

I suppose my assumptions are little skewed. If bitcoin is 1/3 market share you'd have to divide the population of 7 billion by 3 to get about 2.3 billion. 21 million bitcoins distributed evenly among 2.3 billion people is ~.0091 btc per person.
So with 20 million bitcoin holder deaths per year, permanent losses would amount to 182,000 btc.
Assumming a linear rate, 21 million bitcoins would be gone after 115 years if 182,000 were lost per year. (I know the rate would be a slower exponential decay, just simplifying here for brevity).
**TL;DR: OK no problems to see here, move along.**

sry to derail the conversation, but: how do you see the upvote/downvote breakdown of an individual reply?
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:23:42


I disagree. There are selfish reasons to do so if the conditions in the currency exchange markets will bear it.
But overall, I agree it is unlikely, I would mainly worry about this possibility if the velocity of money of Bitcoin goes too low, and if that's the case then Bitcoin itself is threatened for more fundamental reasons.

Even if a "Bitcoin Lender's" total BTC assets are known they could still arrange loan repayment schedules to allow for fractional reserve lending of their BTC assets so no redemption would interefere with one another (in theory). They may not be able to achieve ridiculous reserve rates of 5% (or less) like modern banks, but they could conceivably operate on a fractional reserve of some kind.
Do you think anyone would argue that doing fractional reserve lending in Bitcoins would be some sort of "free market solution to adjust BTC money supply" if ever the 21 million BTC cap becomes somehow "adverse to economic growth" or some such thing? (I use quotes because I'm playing devil's advocate here)
EDIT: I have a sincere interest in Bitcoin, I'm just trying to understand it better. It's not nice to downvote curiosity.

You raise a very good point and defend it logically and effectively. I even learned something. Thanks. 
You have basically persuaded me, excepting for the possibility of human beings being irrational and shooting themselves in the foot and unnecessarily messing up a good payment system (and currency) with derivatives.

people who were born before WWII had a life expectancy of 40? I'm not talking neolithic era dude. I meant like 1900-1945.
My main point is you don't need to live in a 12 bed/4bath house. If you insist on living in that, then yeah, you'll need to take out a loan.

I've been trying to figure when shit starts to more obviously hit the fan for the general public... If 100% of retail investors take their money out of equities, would the FED and institutional investors still be able to prop up the stock market? 
Inflation probably won't do it, people seeing $8 gasoline and $8 loaves of bread won't be intelligent enough to understand that the money is to blame (and the energy situation perhaps) and instead they will blame some other scapegoat.
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:26:32
I agree. I would like to see that data if it exists.

The way I read it the administrator(s) would be the bitcoin miners...
Since new bitcoins enter circulation via all of the operating bitcoin miners. Good luck regulating all of them. They are going to have to realize that their definitions are antiquated and obsolete as this innovation in money spreads. 
One might be able to argue that the bitcoin miners can't be considered administrators since they don't issue at their own whim, it is a simulation of mining. After all are gold miners regulated as money issuers in the mining industry?
EDIT: If gold miners are not considered money issuers and therefore they are not "administrators" under this regulation, then could the bitcoin community redefine bitcoins as a commodity in order to piggyback on the gold distinction to avoid this regulation? Bitcoins would simply be an informational commodity. (I'd even avoid the word virtual)
@_date: 2013-01-06 01:46:58
Well inflation is explicit Federal Reserve Policy. They admit to as much in their mission statement.
