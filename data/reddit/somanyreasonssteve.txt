I hope so. Hopefully it’s not a bubble.

Let’s say you have 5 bitcoin today. You will have 5 bitcoin next year, in five years, ten years. You are not growing the amount of bitcoin you have by sitting still just riding the wave of bitcoins growing price. I was just suggesting a way of investing bitcoin to earn back more bitcoin from real world transactions thus growing the amount of bitcoins you have and thereby growing your investment as bitcoin prices rise as well. As someone pointed out though if price goes up to $50k or more then no return will match that growth from any investment.

Odd concept, I know. Death is going to happen. Not much else you can guarantee in this life.  I am looking to see if people would be willing to invest with bitcoin into adding a crematory in our area.  The returns for the closest one 45 miles away is about $400k year.  So its  a novel idea. Invest bitcoin in a real world crematory operation and receive bitcoins everytime we do a cremation for the next 5 years.

True. I’m hoping there are people sitting on bitcoins who are looking for ways to turn that into an investment in real world tangible options. Like I said this is a novel idea, just putting it out there.

Great question. May not be a viable way to do this. My goal was to convert each cremation USD into whatever bitcoin it buys that day at the current price and send those back each time to the investors.  You make good point if they go up that high this would be terrible investment however you would still be making money every month. Thanks for the question.

Crypto currency is definitely a new world and new way of thinking. Kind of like day trading on steroids. Used to be the safest investment in the world was either tax services or death care. I’m still not convinced crypto is not just a fad that after people pump up the price and dump a few times everyone will loose interest. Unless a currency actually becomes as easily accessible as a credit card and as safe as a bank. I’ve watched bitcoin since it started and seen a lot of people lose money to fake exchanges, Ponzi schemes, and fake cloud bitmining that steals people money overnight. Thanks for your comment and taking time to reply.

I think your spot on. It’s a great ride to the top just be sure to get off the lift before it crashes.

Good one!

I know its a weird idea but I have researched bitcoin strategies and everything seems like ponzi scheme when it comes to growing your bitcoin wallet. Including mining.  So here is a real world way to invest bitcoin and see real results.

I posted a month ago an experiment to see if anyone wanted to invest bitcoin into a real world investment and I would in turn pay out bitcoin back to investors. Cremation is on the rise and we do over 1,250 in our region but they all have to go to a crematory an hour away. If anyone is interested in investing bitcoin into my super crematory project (for people and pets) and in return receive bitcoins each time someone is cremated, message me. Yes I own licensed Funeral home and not some random person wanting to do cremations.

So bitcoin is not a currency then it’s not going to revolutionize spending if everyone just hodl then it’s just a security like stock. If that’s true it will never reach much higher. It has no value it’s just a novelty. If you want bitcoin to become a method of payment accepted everywhere you have to...spend it. It will have to lose value to around $1 to $100 bitcoin to be mass market. Why? Going to fast food and seeing fractional amounts on menu like cheeseburger 0.00032 btc doesn’t work well for the public. They like numbers that are easier to understand. Would you trust a fast food worker with your digital wallet to not moss decimal place and over charge you?
