Here’s your dip

What’s the process/verification for getting it out from local coins? Everything I have read of Coinbase seems to suggest lengthy verification and fees for international bank transfers etc

If you think it will dip in January then buy in January
Or buy a little each week for the next few weeks

I was looking at this earlier and at a guess it’s looking at the Bitpay exchange. I could be wrong but it seems more in line with that than GDAX or Coinbase

Ouch, that would hurt
Well I just did a sale and the money is sat in my bank, I have released the coins and I’m hoping that’s that, surely they can’t get the money back now

So I was a little lazy and didn’t even look into your suggestion of Localbitcoins but I have now - 
So, You transfer bitcoin into their online wallet, you find a buyer with an agreed price and payment method, they send you the money, you say it’s been done and the site releases your coin to the buyer.
is my understanding correct? If so, what guarantees do you have as a buyer or seller?

Sounds good but unless I’m missing something - I don’t really want to drop £40 of BTC on something that’s gonna cost me £10 in transaction fees

Any idea on best places to sell and more importantly withdraw to a uk bank account?

I wonder what % of bitcoin holders would celebrate Thanksgiving. Enough for it to make a sizeable impact? If so then I would expect Christmas to have a much bigger impact as I would assume the ratio of people getting together for Xmas to be much higher than a holiday only celebrated in the US

Thanks for that, I’ll see if I can import keys from bread. Unfortunately I don’t get to set the fees on bread and they are currently £25.85. Although if I want to send half the amount it’s ‘only’ £15 
I was thinking of selling the whole amount I want to move around (instant transfer) and then buying LTC/ETH to move around, but then I’m going to get hit with a bunch of exchange fees

We haven’t even reached 10,000 in England yet

So your dad took liability for an investment and received no reward?

I have a smallish amount of bitcoin and about 40% of that value in ETH and LTC, what are your thoughts on selling the ETH and LTC to buy more bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:01:36
Would using Bread Wallet be any better?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:27:14
So is your thinking that Bitcoin can experience the same rate of growth as ETH and LTC?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:08:01
Thanks, I also have a little ETH and LTC, I’ve only had it a few days but it is currently sat in my Coinbase wallet. Where would be the best place to put that? Ideally something I can use on my phone (iOS) like bread wallet
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:26:17
What is you’re reasoning behind that route?

90 days later - I guess you were right!
