Hodling anytime the price is high is a mugs game, fools hodl, when clever investors dump and wait for a cheaper buying opportunity.

Yes only contracts settled in real BTC effects supply.

Don’t sell it, keep it and wait, you are not alone in that you bought at the top.
It may seem like the right move to recoup something, but I would say hold it for a couple more years, you will recoup your money, it may take a while though.

“Tendency”, I would say guaranteed to lower price personally, I would also say it’s theft of people’s savings or income which they’ve been willing to invest.
Secondly, it’s not price low that triggers adoption, BTC price low has a negative effect on the market as the populous don’t buy in when a ships sinking.
Price high is when people buy in, once BTC hits £10k uk they’re piling in like xmas 2017, the only reason the price collapses was the introduction of CME futures the graphs show this clearly.
All these contracts are not needed, neither are these institutions, the irony is that this is meant to be a decentralised system, but it’s being over taken by the centralised system and people who always cause financial crashes, these futures don’t benefit bitcoin they benefit traders, and the institutions like CME who make all the profit.
BTC does not make any return from them, price rise is what fuels adoption, this increases demand and lowers supply, left unchecked BTC is capable of becoming main stream with the populous, it doesn’t need their interference.
Behind the scenes there is government pressure stopping BTC price rises like last time because simply they fear the consequences of people withdrawing their savings and dumping it into BTC.
BTC itself could cause a bank run if price high gets to a point that no one wants to be left out, this institutional stuff is the devil it’s self.
Hopefully they have more worries with the pending bond market crash, hopefully they’ll leave BTC alone.

I know exactly how the BTC market works, you’ll always have tanking prices, sell high buy low, it’s that simple.
When people cashed out 2017 how many cheap BTC do you think they bought back?
When you get to grips with investing you’ll understand one simple rule, and that is that it doesn’t matter if you call the top price spot on, or sell at absolute bottom, what you should do is not be greedy, this way you’ll win.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:25:17
Well BTC won’t replace banks, people laugh about that, it’s so preposterous that talking like that in public will get you ridiculed.
BTC can barely work as it is, it’s slow, you can track transaction and see how much your competition has, it’s volatile, immutability is a fatal flaw, why would anyone think it could replace a bank.
Look this is how the world work, the regulators say what happens and what you do, it’s the same for bitcoins, jump when they say jump and you’ll not overthrow the government.
All anarchist or most gradually grow up one day, they reflect their wayward youth are realise how silly they sounded, you will also but at least you can say you were there, even if BTC is doomed to fail.
Elixir will kill BTC David chaum will sell his vision to governments in my opinion, BTC will be a history lesson how not to invest.

@_date: 2018-12-07 09:39:47
Well firstly Bitcoins price crash 2017 wasn’t a bubble it was caused by CME futures contracts driving the price down.
And I though we were discussing Crypto not the housing market and the other garbage you’ve mentioned, and are trying to compare with a low use, low demand market like crypto.
Prices only rise when demand out strips supply, if you don’t understand this concept you shouldn’t be investing, you should be concentrating on your job at Tesco’s stacking shelves ����.

That’s all people are is obsessed, and more fatally in love with their investments, that’s a fatal flaw of investing, having emotions for the stuff you’ve put money in.

That’s what a fool does, the market is collapsing and you’ll buy something no one wants or has a use for.
Having a wallet with coins in that do nothing and have no monetary value is tantamount to having a cupboard full of old shoes, NO one wants them.
Anymore money you waste would evaporate into someone else’s pockets like the exchange owners.
All these things you should know.

@_date: 2018-12-08 15:10:55
I would say there are more hodlers who have lost, if you think taking profit is silly and you should hodl for dear life that’s crazy.
In bitcoin land you don’t have to be a brainiac to realise the price is on a run, but that run will stop and go back down, I’m saying sell, and wait.
I know many people who use this practice I know not of one who hasn’t made money or accumulated more BTC than they had originally.
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:48:51
“IRONY” so you think hodlers don’t  lose money hodling ����.
Think about it, if the price you bought at has profit on it and you don’t sell, and the price comes down, you’ve lost money you could have cashed out.
Taking profits is the way you invest, not hodl until you’re a bag holder.
It really makes no sense.
Especially considering the price will come down again and you will buy in lower again.

Firstly, there is a looming tax bill for many traders so they will be selling of BTC to pay the taxes owed.
Also many people are banking on BAKKT pulling BTC out of its decline, and this will only happen if those futures contracts are payed in real BTC, my opinion is the SEC will deny them this right and they will go instead for cash settled contracts.
And thirdly yes the large amount of BTC that’s on the move recently does look like someone’s ready to dump.
So these are the reasons why i believe the BTC price will go to $2000 or less, between now and the end of January.
You could even see people selling out on any bad BAKKT news because the BTC price is truly manipulated via CME and it will get worse with more futures contracts and Possible ETFs that are all payed out in cash, and planned to be launched in the new year.
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:25:05
How can it become a reserve currency when it’s not a currency?
And what good is it as a currency to the banking system, if everyone has bitcoins and no savings in banks anymore, those banks have no liquidity so cannot make car, house, or other loans.
This is the point that the system collapses.
People have bitcoin but it’s not designed for loans ect, that would take away more of it decentralised shine.

@_date: 2018-12-08 08:34:48
Because simply they are faking the real Bitcoins that are linked to the Blockchain by creating paper ones of the “IOU kind”, what that does is divert demand by them for real ones, because they aren’t settling those side bets (futures contracts) in real BTC, meaning they don’t create supply issues, hence the BTC price doesn’t go up, in fact they drive it down this way “with ease”.
Only contracts settled in real BTC makes price high, and they won’t let that happen.
The reasons they won’t let that happen is because, once  the price rises, FOMO kicks in again, price rises higher and BTC becomes a threat to the current system.
One thing no one on here has figures out about BTC is that when nakamoto created it, he created the perfect vehicle for mass bank runs, you see once price of BTC is so high nobody can resist pumping money in, they’ll drain their bank accounts just for this purpose.
When this same action happens  in the  banking system, bank runs are to save your money by just taking it out.
Does that make sense, so you see they’ll do what ever it takes to stop this run away chain of events, triggered by high BTC prices.
Why keep money in a bank account when BTC is rising by thousands a week.
BTC has many flaws people aren’t working out.

No your wrong completely, demand only grows if you settle with real bitcoins, if they’re cash settled they basically drive demand down for real BTC, and the price follows.
CME futures have done the same thing.
You don’t see that they’re creating fake BTC in essence, you will when the price ranks lower and you realise they’re controlling the price.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:33:11
Absolutely true, and it’s going way lower yet, no ones buying it enough to effect supply.
@_date: 2018-12-09 08:20:19
No they don’t accept them, but the point is those Fake Bitcoin futures are leaving Bitcoin with no place to go accept backwards to places like the dark net.
No one need have use for them now.
So demand for them has fallen as you see by the sell off, and the price is lowering with it, the more they issue the longer this drought for real bitcoins goes on and the lower the price will go.
NO DEMAND, NO ONE BUYING, = LOWER PRICE= DEATH.
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:39:40
It won’t be approved and if it is it won’t be cash settled, they’re realising regulating cross border tokens and a blockchain infrastructure isn’t possible.

5)the big wallets dump, at this stage it’s end game.

Oh because bitcoin can’t suffer hyperinflation that doesn’t mean it cannot become worthless, you’re confused also about value, value only exists if it is said or agrees by those holding it and in the wider market.
In Bitcoins case the wider market will in the end say whether it has value, but at present demand shows people are not buying it so it’s losing value rapidly.
Also bitcoin isn’t a stable store of value, by definition it’s to volatile, also if you knew anything about dollars you’d realise the reason people invest them is to ward agonist inflation.
But I can tell you know nothing about money because the US is owed virtually as much in as what it owes out, so all the garbage talk about the US dollar and US bankruptcy show me your probably in your late teens.

@_date: 2018-12-05 17:28:04
I believe you’ve got it absolutely right, what most of the people on here miss is the basic supply and demand metrics of a limit coin or other, simple as it is while the CME settles in cash and doesn’t have to buy BTC to settle they don’t create supply issues and that keeps the BTC price low.
If they do or did settle in real BTC the price would sky rocket as the supply would become less, and price rises, then demand becomes higher FOMO. 
Bitcoin then moons, and threatens the establishment, they won’t let it happen.

Yes your clearly clueless, as you’ve not worked out the bottom line is people who make large sums in profit, know the market.
If you only knew how much individuals I know have made, sure they know the market. When to buy and when they need to dump.
And you don’t even know what the definition of a currency is, Bitcoin is not a currency, it’s a speculative asset first and foremost.
It isn’t a currency because it is volatile in the highest degree, saying BTC is a currency shows me you’ve no understanding of economics, and I can see you have little or no understanding of trading.
I don’t think you offer me any knowledge through this conversation so I’ll stop now.
Ps high liquidity removes volatility, and in turn can make a currency stable, I could tell you how much a bitcoin would have to be worth for this to happen, but I can’t be bothered as you’d probably say I was wrong.
But without this liquidity in the BTC market it ain’t no currency by definition.

Absolutely true, Bitcoin banking on the system collapsing is not a good sign.
This perfect creation that was intended to be incorruptible has ironically been corrupted via this inflation of the BTC supply.
I’m sure satoshi wouldn’t have bothered if he’d known how easy it has been for the powers that be to overwhelm any kind of grip it did have.
I personally think this is a huge flaw on his behalf in his planning of said BTC token.

The fundamentals are not strong at all, it would be a bad replacement for fiat, society relies on loans and lending.
As I said earlier it’s bullshit, because there are better crypto now, they do more faster ect, problem is for them BTC is the king for now.
The network will only be as strong as the price lets it be, that’s a worry, miners won’t mine coins that aren’t profitable, there could become a time they quit.
And your speak with such irony, you mention shitty government  decisions yet I can show you many in crypto, you don’t get to vote your opinion on ROOT STOCK, OR MAST or MIMBLE WIMBLE or other, as they are implemented via blockstream without your say so, I can’t see the difference.
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:04:30
This guys correct and anyone on here is a bullshitter that doesn’t deserve to own crypto currency if they say their waiting for a magical number.
Fuck wit people like this show they have no knowledge of BTC and are in essence insulting satoshi design.
I mean he made them divisible idiots for a reason, the reason was so even low income people could buy in at a fraction of.
So why anyone waits is stupid, and you look stupid by saying it.
Buying fractions over time is a better choice than buying all in one, as you get chance to play the markets price fluctuations, done right you can make more BTC than you would of had buying in one go.
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:46:33
Sorry but your comment is absolute crap, firstly hodl only stops the price going to zero, it doesn’t increase price, it’s just a mechanism for propping it up.
And “NO” hodling doesn’t cause supply issues, only price high and adoption causes supply issues, because price high cause FOMO and this spiral takes BTC price to new highs.
And “NO” low demand does not cause the BTC price to jump to new highs, price Spurs new highs, because that spurs adoption.
You seem to not understand that paper BTC makes demand less, and it also waters down the BTC supply, in other words they’re legally producing fake Bitcoins which they  settle with cash, making profit for the traders and the trading desk company.
Without if you’re following buying or touching a single bitcoin, it’s pretty genius and a cheap way of keeping BTC price as low as they want, and capping its adoption.
These contracts are massively damaging, and they’re laughing at you.

Well if you knew anything about finance you’d realise by collapsing the banking system in such away, you’d collapse the system.
Mortgages wouldn’t be lent car loans, business loans ect, because there are now no depositors or any means for the banks to lend, if you can’t work out what that would mean for BTC also then I can’t be bothers to explain, but I’ll give you a clue in the respect of a big pin and a big bubble.
So yes if you have any financial knowledge you’ll know that implementing this BTC thing into a world financial system, to take over is preposterous, because it needs the system it was created to kill, and the money and jobs that system has created.
You’ll be unemployed real quick without a banking system.
Anyway long before that could happen, the banks would stop withdrawals, bank runs or mast withdrawals for BTC wouldn’t be allowed to happen.
Anyone who thinks this system can be beat is a fool.

I take it you don’t know about hyperinflation hahahahaha, of course the dollar would be worthless in a scenario like that yes.
But we weren’t talking about the dollar, nor can the dollar or America go bankrupt, you watch to many conspiracy theory programs on YouTube rather than studying economics.
Your funny though, but I tire of you easy as you crash of financial thinks is akin to that of a 10 year old.

No they’re hodling and encourage hodling because they know that if everyone sells and no one buys what they sell the price collapses, because BTC isn’t  a productive asset.

Still watching the BTC price (BELL BOY) hate to say it but I was right, keep watching all the way down to $2000 dollars.

So where are they buying these Bitcoins?
They must be OTC, and how does anyone know that it’s grayscale, do the openly declare their personal information.
I’m personally not convinced by any of these stories, in fact I’ve read many posts on reddit this year stating how many people are buying up huge amounts of Bitcoin.
Now, if this is correct how come the price is it lowest for a long time and still declining.
These headlines are pure fantasy as you can’t have high demand and a set supply without effecting the price rise up.
You don’t get huge demand and price declines, this isn’t how supply and demand works.

Your correct with your analogy, that’s exactly what they’ve created, the investors benefit by fiat payments, the trading desks and companies that own them make a profit off everyone.
At the same time they steal of BTC investors who are injecting their wages and savings into BTC, as they erode the price by increasing supply.
No more 21 million BTC, “NO” it’s as many as they want to print.

There all here for the money my friend, men don’t walk down the street and not pick up a note someone has dropped.
Not in it for the money is lies.

More paper, they don’t need Bitcoins, cleaver aren’t they.
