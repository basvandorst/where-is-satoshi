Have you looked into Armory yet? -  It allows you to generate a paper wallet via your desktop. I imagine you could download the software to USB stick and then install it on an air gapped PC. However (I don't believe) you can  create addresses until you are connected to the network. Put you should be able to create a wallet. 
You can read more about securing your wallet at:  There are some websites that allow you to make paper wallets as well (client side) but that would go against what you are looking for.

As I was driving to work last week I thought about Satoshi spending this Christmas as a digital Santa Claus raining bitcoins all over the world. 
Had I got in on mining earlier in life I'm sure I would be offering them wherever I saw the need. It would be great to see something like  accept Bitcoin.

At this point, I don't believe so. If anything, it should be healthy competition. It also allows for a more diverse portfolio of digital currencies. As mentioned alt-coins get a bad wrap sometimes -- many of them appear and disappear rapidly. They seem to me very much like penny stocks. With a smaller market they are easier to manipulate and end up getting exchanged for BTC at some point.

This one, which I randomly clicked on one of the pages had some action:

All of my experiences with Coinbase have been great. The wait time on funding your account kind of sucks. Up to ~4 business days for your first deposit to go in.
