Then bought bcash...
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:13:04
Buy all the time, I bought at the last ATH, when it dropped $2000. Meh, who cares.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:24:38
Yep. It's about to go hugely in one way or the other.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:19:00
I shorted bcash at 2700 if that helps
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:35:10
Just happened as I posted.
@_date: 2018-09-16 03:11:54
because your post is retarded. why do you think there is so much investment in the blockchain without anything to do with crypto? because its a great way of storing distributed data.
@_date: 2018-09-16 11:18:35
Why would I when you can Google blockchain and learn for yourself. I'm not wikipedia.
@_date: 2018-09-16 05:42:48
then I suggest you need to do a ton of research quick smart.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:03:48
This isn't good. Big crash coming this weekend.
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:22:25
Great  run down
@_date: 2018-06-25 02:49:42
Nah. Feb 2014 I used two AMD cards and broke 2 chains in two weeks and made 100 coins. First chain broke in around 5mins.
It was pure luck, difficulty went up not long after.
Sold the 100 coins for $20 each :/
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:37:51
stupid move.
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:59:00
It shows the level of intelligence in crypto
@_date: 2018-06-05 19:16:25
I've been in the ms eco system 25yrs. It's a stupid move. Ms was run by Ballmer who was quite a different operator. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:09:34
2fa is the ONLY thing to use. everything should be secured with 2fa.
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:27:29
Hey guys some company I'm scared of just bought github. Let's jump ship like idiots even though ms has been tightly integrated with them the last few years!! That'll teach em
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:16:12
It's so easy to do and has been done already with BCH (2700 price spike). I imagine it's happening in BTC as well. That's why I a little worried that the charts are not going to mean squat shortly once some manipulation takes place.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:46:13
Well... I had 100 of them I sold at $20, so yeah.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:42:25
If you're margin trading, nothing wrong with a long/short on btrash.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:53:23
yeah, I want to avoid that. Just personal reasons.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:36:45
Instructions not clear. Cooked cow and didn't get bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:31:27
I think it's happening because its gained so much awareness. Everyone I know is talking about it now. Lots of stupid money going in. So, imo, this is why a correction *hasn't* occurred.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:21:19
This is the most likely outcome imo.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:03:42
because of stupid hodler memes. only the stupid hold.
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:53:20
pretty much my take. It's just crazy the bch folk seem to spend so much energy attacking bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:23:25
Oh I follow  for the lols (which he now owns).
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:30:40
I mean more of a scare. On my platform 40% of people shorted @ 5k LOL
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:10:08
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:16:43
If there was WW3, BTC would be worthless for kinda obvious reasons.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:59:48
Good way to lose money.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:30:18
I'm am pretty certain there is another big dip. Likely back to the 4200 mark.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:38:08
Fuck yeah, it's fun as.
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:53:50
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:34:47
Likely. I'd assume they are already plotting something like this now.
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:55:50
time to short this.
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:53:35
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:34:03
Assets, gold etc wont. So shoving all your cash into bitcoin instead of say a house, or property isn't the best imo.
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:56:52
It's pretty mindblowing watching this, and then wondering who is actually pulling the strings in some of these plays.
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:02:04
I just margin trade on these big jumps. Make out like a bandit and close out. Make out on the sell like a bandit. Fuck actually holding bitcoins. If the world goes to shit, bitcoins with be useless.
@_date: 2018-07-21 03:26:33
There is always a cycle.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:31:23
Fair enough. What are you using if you don't mind me asking g?
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:03:56
I'm actually leaving for the next 4 days. I can give a break down once I get back.
I'm buying @ 4900 with 10x with 30 leverage. I held to 5100, saw it run out of gas, sold, hit 5000, bought again, sold @ 5150 and so on.
Yes, it's better to hold. But you never know on 5/15min charts what's going to happen. I was debating holding overnight last night - which I should have, but I've lost thousands doing that. I don't have the leverage to sink more than around $300 of BTC on a trade (at 10x and above).
@_date: 2018-07-20 10:18:52
I really don't need to. The comments here make yall look stupid enough.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:22:02
Well, slightly beforehand if you play your charts right. I mainly play on 5min and 15min charts - long/shorting bitcoin depending (hardly ever shorting except the china thing). I hardly ever hold trades longer than a day. Mostly a few hours. This recent jump I had about 6 trades all open/closed in 2hrs.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:37:24
That's pretty cool. I ask as I'm very interested in AI within trading. It's the future. I'm a .net coder myself. What platform allows you to hook in via Ali? I imagine they'd rate limit commands and stuff as well?
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:06:46
yeah, likely @ 8k as well. Was surprised it didn't happen this time @ 5k. So many buy orders though you were pretty safe.
@_date: 2018-07-20 06:39:31
I've made more off housing tbh. Mellenials are mostly stupid.
Going off most of the comments here, you don't know what you're doing. You don't make money renting.
@_date: 2018-07-20 06:40:47
There always is. That's how you make money. What was that big bitcoin bubble in dec/jan? Did that not happen?
