But you are aware that we need to print money in order to keep the economy from coming to a grinding halt, right? Not adding money coupled with economic progress means the currency increases in value over time. People stop buying stuff when they know it‘ll be cheaper tomorrow. This creates a positive feedback loop leading to rapid deflation  and the collapse of the economy.

Why? I don‘t have a problem buying one with a debit or credit card.


Paypal‘s buyer‘s protection is known to heavily favor buyers over sellers which can be very handy when buying an iPhone and getting sent a brick. How would you handle that situation if you had paid in crypto? When selling things online, I‘ve never had any problems using direct bank transfers (haven‘t done it in a while though).


I don‘t have to. I can temporarily and instantly increase my withdrawal limit online and withdraw whatever amount from any ATM (for free — as I currently live in Europe). Not that that‘s a situation one would often get into though...


Wow.. should I even reply to that? Good luck to your investments in the future...

Online banking. I don‘t know the last time I‘ve set foot in a bank.


Paypal, Apple Pay, fintech banks like N26 in Berlin etc make this possible. BTC not so much actually unless you’re willing to pay astronomical fees. But even if that was to be resolved, instant and free money transfers to whomever are already possible in fiat.


Wat. I’ve never had that worry. What does this even mean?

@_date: 2017-11-27 19:02:02


Source? With its fixed amount it'll be rather heavily prone to deflation (with -- if it's actually used as a currency -- no political means to hinder it from blowing up into a crisis for the people relying on it).


Is that it? Why would anyone give up the stability and security of our current financial system for that? Unless of course they need the anonymity.


[Wonder why we have correlations like this?](
Anyway, people are currently either hodling (speculating on gains) or paying for stuff they want to pay for anonymously. What else would an anonymous electronic cash transfer be used for anyway?  Otherwise you'd also have paid for your rent. And of course you paid your rent in USD because you'll want to be able to prove that you did actually pay, right?


The govt. doesn't care about tax evasion. Ok bud.


And people actually get tracked down and sentenced daily in part due to the difficulty of transferring large amount of fiat over long distances anonymously. Now with bitcoin, that's all changing. And especially in the drug world, that change is already in full swing.
