You write a script to scrape common phrases from the web or other sources, you hash each of them and turn them into bitcoin private keys, and store these with their addresses in a big fast database. You then modify a bitcoin daemon to watch the network for any transactions sending output to any address in your database. As soon as you see such a transaction, you broadcast your own transaction emptying the wallet into one that you control.
Meanwhile, your script keeps running the whole time, collecting common phrases and your database only gets bigger.
For this reason, most brainwallets are cracked long before they're even created.

Have you ever heard of a "reference implementation"? If you're claiming that the reference implementation *defines the protocol in all respects*, then there is absolutely no point to any alternative implementation. Anything in the reference implementation, even a serious bug, is by definition in the protocol, and you would reject any attempt to fix a bug. Any alternative implementation would have to include the same bug, so why bother?

Then call Coinbase and Bitpay the merchants and HostFats argument holds.


You might be right about Bitcoin users not caring about fees. Do you have any evidence?


HostFat was thinking one step ahead of you on Holders. If one bitcoin is worth $100,000, and blocksize doesn't increase, transaction fees are going to be hundreds of dollars.

Yet there's only one whitepaper, but you act surprised because you based your knowlege on your favourite reddit posts. This is what Satoshi wrote:
    The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.  If the output value of a transaction is
    less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
    the   block   containing   the   transaction.     Once   a   predetermined   number   of   coins   have   entered
    circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
    free.

You use [coinapult]( without Mycelium.
You can also take out a short position on an exchange with the same total size as the amount of your holdings. When Bitcoin goes down, your short position goes into profit, balancing the total. However, if Bitcoin goes up too much, your short will liquidate.
This is basically what Coinapult does anyway, but if you do it using leverage, then you can reduce your counterparty exposure.

Glad to hear it. Now, I can address the rest of your response, which I find quite interesting.
I think what you're actually doing is committing a form of *ad Hominem*. What if we apply your argument to Einstein, and I find proof that "he personally believed that blacks were inferior to whites". We then say that this opinion is so revolting that we should not allow him to publish any work, whether it be on race or physics. *Ad hominem* includes attacking a person because of things they have said before or profess to believe, instead of attacking their arguments directly.
Your argument also contains the assumption that the best response to misinformation is blocking it. I think it's less clear here, because we are in an age of misinformation, and we are still learning to deal with it. Perhaps blocking misinformation is a good option, but some success has been had by campaigns to spread debunking, particularly when those campaigns are supported by authorities.
Anyway, I want to make it clear that I see two quite separate issues here: the blocking of discussion, and the vilification of people (which is what was doing above). I find it particularly disturbing that the moderators of won't even link to forums where the unwanted discussions can continue.
