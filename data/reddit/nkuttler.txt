Faucets like this are not only completely useless, they are bad for bitcoin. This one pays 0.00000075 BTC for every request. That's dust that can't be spent. A faucet like this only serves one purpose: to generate ad revenue. It's bad for bitcoin as new users will have a frustrating experience.

This seems to be a paraphrase of a quote by Bruce Schneier from Applied Cryptography:
One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)
Given that k = 1.38×10-16 erg/°Kelvin, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2°Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2°K would consume 4.4×10-16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.
Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21×1041 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7×1056 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2192. Of course, it wouldn't have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.
But that's just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 1051 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.
These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.

After seeing how many exchanges with custom wallets made mistakes with malleability it scares me a little that you want to implement your own wallet instead of making a frontend to the official wallet software.
From the skillset you're looking for it sounds like you want a person that can implement the frontend and the backend of your web wallet, and interact with the blockchain on a low level at the same time. What can I say.. good luck!

Core devs have already communicated why a hard fork **right now** isn't the right thing to do.
Personally, I also don't think that "almost everyone" thinks a hardfork has to be done. What I see is a lot of new accounts promoting a sudden increase with all it's risk, companies who try to centralize bitcoin, and people who aren't even aware of the capacity FAQ.
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:12:48
Everybody who wants to be well informed should also read 
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:49:56


That's only half the story though. There are people who think they know better than what the core devs have outlined in  and they keep rebranding their alternatives and flip-flopping which block size they actually want.
Now they are at their latest attempt with a 2MB fork **asap** that has several problems described in the faq. Meanwhile core devs keep doing their work and have outlined their plan on how to scale, and how to increase the block size safely in the future.
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:05:43
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:55:21
Going down to 2MB is no compromise, it's still a hardfork **right now** no matter which size. In computing there are problems that don't scale in a linear way, please read the FAQ.

Calling a small blocksize increase a compromise is ill-informed at best. It's mostly about **hardforking asap**, and it doesn't matter if it's to 20M or 2M blocks, it's still a **hardfork asap**. What would a real compromise look like? Agree that a hardfork might be necessary, but that it's not really feasible right now, but will be done if necessary in the future. That's exactly what core devs propose, please read

I had a look at your site a few days ago and this is what I said on IRC:
* Your signup form deletes all inputs when the registration fails for some reason (captcha for me IIRC). That's highly unprofessional.
* Your registation mail subject starts with [Bank of Satoshi]. That's a branding failure if you're "Vault of Satoshi". Btw, isn't calling yourself a bank regulated somehow where you run the business?
* You ask for a OTP on my first login, which was never configured. I am a developer and have implemented web-based OTP myself, and it took me several minutes to figure out how to configure this stuff on your site.
* Sending the OTP by email is a bad idea (I think this was necessary for my first login? Can't really remember). Email was not designed to be instantaneous, delays of several minutes and occasionaly longer have to be expected. The OTP is only valid one minute.
* I don't trust a third party with my OTP secret. You seem to be using a third party, 
* Hosted at godaddy and using their "website protection" and "verified &amp; secure" badges. Godaddy has a long history of bad service, and as somebody who works in the industry those badges look like bad jokes to me.

@_date: 2013-11-10 23:27:30
Yes, but I can't yet. That's my whole point. I have to pay a third party that pays the restaurant cash.

I wouldn't trust a dentist who inserts dental implants of the wrong color either. Even if dentistry isn't about colors.

That's a feature, she makes it sound easy to use bitcoin. We don't need someone who rambles for hours about cryptography, paper wallets and what not and scares people away. Yes, she doesn't talk about security, but ultimately it will be up to service providers to provide secure wallets for 'normal' people.

It's proven to be a hoax, that guy said it himself
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:00:30
It's not an investment, it's speculation. Never speculate with more than you are comfortable to lose.

If the only good thing that comes out of this is that the speculators get out... win!

Have a majority not upgrade?

Thanks, fwiw I get a "That username is not allowed." when using the same as here (7 letters, should be valid according to the tooltip).
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:15:02
Hey, look, you say "this community really pisses me off". If you prefer to stay in a place you don't like, where you suffer because of perceived low quality of posts, it's really up to you, I tried to be helpful.
But now you even drag religion into this. Honestly, right now you sound like a common troll. Btw, I'm german, you could call me a nazi or something.
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:29:23
I see, thanks for the info.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:40:16
I doubt we'll hear anything before monday.
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:24:36
Better get a different default domain.. pretty sure running a business that offers basically the same service under basically the same name in basically the same area violates some kind of regulation.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:15:26
Past performance is not an indicator.
Look, I have coins, I'm bullish, but I factor in the possibility of BTC hitting $0.01.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:04:47
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:25:41
And again, you fail to keep this civil. Yes, saying "acting like jehovas witnesses" in a pejorative way is also a religious statement.
And no, I don't think people are downvoting you because you are "negative", but because you are rude and insulting. You could make your point without this.
For the record, your original comment that started this thread was just sensationalist, it deteriorated from there.
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:05:10
Just don't make any hasty decisions.
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:25:32
Maybe not so much if you want to keep your finger.

The headline is incorrect, there were 300 downloads. The plugin is currently at v0.8, so the number 300 includes upgrades. Also notice that only one person has rated the plugin yet.
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:39:20
Already being discussed here 
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:37:35
I think the downvotes are rather because of your tone. You have a valid point but you're dressing it as an insult.
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:38:50
I will not only order dinner, I also created free advertising for them: 
Accepting BTC is a clever move for any business ;-)

More supply than demand.
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:37:10
Works now!

I think  is to blame. I do not want smooth scrolling, if I wanted it I'd enable it in my browser.
Tested in recent chrome + firefox on Debian.
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:47:21
It's good to hear that you are working on improving things.
@_date: 2013-11-06 12:50:50
That's awesome! I can even order burgers from there, I didn't even know that was possible in my city.
@_date: 2013-10-20 12:54:44
Do you already have an idea for the awesome app?

Which words? Sell order? Mayve start with

Because it's about at least 7.5 million € according to the owner. Add to that $ and BTC..
btc24 is closed for almost a week now without usable info.

I wasn't comparing napster and bitcoin on a technical level, but on influence. Even if napster is irrelevant nowadays, it paved the way for file sharing for the masses.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:51:54
Yes, I also have an account now, though I got an error every time I tried to register. The last one was that the username was already taken ;-)
But now I get a 500 on  I'll check again tomorrow..

So alexa reports traffic from people who are stupid enough to install one of those spyware toolbars. This leads me to think that the bitcoin sites should be ranked even higher. But then, alexa stats are mostly useless anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:30:38
Nah, price was around $200-300 before the last wave of speculators got in. In my opinion that would still be a great price. A little more stability at a lower level would be good.

I've been in verification limbo for weeks. Then I wrote an email and this was the reply:

Aaaaw man, I was soo looking forward to stealing my first coins..

I think she intentionally doesn't talk about paper wallets. Get people to use bitcoins first. They can still get paper wallets later.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:25:08
You should update the wiki.
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:02:34
I think people understand "fraction of fraction", and that a chain of exponents looks odd. If^you^disagree^that's^fine. And wikipedia.

Only $100 up this week. Some people should look at daily charts I guess.

Nice music. Not sure what most of the people were saying though.

While the claim is not totally implausible klawd doesn't seem trustworthy.
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:11:20
I also found a press release 
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:05:41
Yeah, i just had a quick look at the post history and there's a pattern...
@_date: 2013-10-29 17:06:07
Who knows, yes, it could also be an example of great storytelling.
@_date: 2013-10-20 16:12:31
Nobody is asking you to do that.
@_date: 2013-11-16 12:54:44
Funny how some people miss your point. The graph uses fractions of fractions. 1 zeptometre is 10^−21 m, with m being the [fundamental unit of length](
What OP did is 10^-3^-18 m, which doesn't make much sense, except that so many zeros wouldn't fit into the graph. Of course there's [scientific notation]( but not everybody can read that.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:58:16
Bitcoin has no "real" price, the best you can do is probably to calculate an average by market volume. Even then you have to pick the exchanges, ignore anything that happens outside them, etc.


@_date: 2013-11-11 14:35:40
Depends on the restaurant. I often order a simple salad or something that's less than 10€.

I'll be in Berlin next month, I guess I'll purchase my first physical good with BTC there, should have enough for a warm meal. Is there a list with restaurants/bars that accept BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:54:05
Isn't that what web wallets already do?
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:05:02
I really don't understand the people who bet on yet another bubble. The market is much bigger, has more actors, has historical data, bitcoin is more widely used, etc.
Will there be bubbles in the future? Probably. Is the price guaranteed to ever fall significantly below the current one? Nope.
