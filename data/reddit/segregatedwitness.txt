I'm sure that my interests in bitcoin are radically different than AXAs interests and I think it's funny that AXA is one of the main financial sponsors of Blockstream.
So please tell me how can Blockstream help to create a independent, uncontrolled and open financial network for everyone when that is the exact opposite of what your investors want?
There is no logic in your investors giving your company that much money and you are not developing things in their financial interests.

a prostitute could also claim that these men did not buy her but whenever someone gives money to someone else he wants something in return. This is especially true when it's 50+ millions.
I know you can't disclose what investors like AXA want blockstream to do. Maybe you don't even know but they don't give you guys millions of dollars to work on a better future.

@_date: 2016-01-25 18:31:27
miners secure the network and you don't seem to understand the bitcoin difficulty. If the fork happens the 10% on the short chain have in the worst case 10% hashrate for 100% the difficulty for the next 2000+ blocks. Do you know how long it would take until the blocktime is back to 10 minutes!?
@_date: 2016-01-25 18:57:04
they just need someone to hang when everything falls apart
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:46:56
I know about the problems with it. I just don't see any point in proving that a problem exists that everyone knew before. Especially if the alternative is core devs posting ACKs and NACKs that in the end only count if they look good.
Look at this core dev behavior:
We are implementing BIP XXX because we have 100% developer consensus.
We are implementing feature XX, it does not need consensus it does not even need a BIP assigned.
From my perception, an developer that is running a voting system that he developed to make decisions is far better than an developer that already demonstrated he does what he want regardless what others say.
Don't try to make consider.it look bad because of facts everyone know. It's only hurting bitcoin. Or do you think interrupting the meaningless ACK/NACK orgy on github will benefit bitcoin in any way?
@_date: 2016-01-25 18:16:23
except that they won't have 2 different blockchains. If classic does a hardfork that activates at 90% the 10% chain will quickly become worthless and die.
@_date: 2016-01-25 18:23:08
that's right but that is what will happen. The 10% chain will be insecure and the remaining 10% miners will make a big loss because of the high difficulty forcing them to join the longer chain. The exchanges and payment processors will follow the money just like the miners and be will ready for the fork long before the 90% activation. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:25:55
Are you a Blockstream employee? This is not an attack.
@_date: 2016-01-25 10:54:11
That is why they have verified users. I can post 1000 ACKS on github to do the same for the bitcoin core vorting mechanism but since random user votes don't count much, it would be a waste of time.

@_date: 2016-06-22 12:31:53
please stop talking about this without further research. If you did a transaction a year ago that never confirmed it's not on the network anymore.  
This is about current unconfirmed transactions on the live bitcoin network.


As long as these transactions are on the network (in nodes mempools and/or actively broadcasted) they are unconfirmed transactions. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 09:31:31
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:05:50
Why do you want to make it unnecessary complicated? 
If a unconfirmed transaction is not broadcasted since a defined amout of blocks consider it rejected. I don't know of any node implementation that keeps and rebroadcasts unconfirmed transactions indefinitely. Doesn't make sense...
That's why you don't see 1 year old unconfirmed transactions on the network unless someone (a human) actively rebroadcasts them.

stop the hairsplitting... we are talking about unconfirmed transactions in the mempool of the network.
@_date: 2016-06-22 12:38:50
Just count all unconfirmed transactions that are currently on the bitcoin network and you have it.
Why is that so hard to understand?
An unconfirmed transaction that is not on the network anymore is basically a forgotten or rejected transaction until someone re-broadcasts ist.
The first uses network resources the second one doesn't.
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:11:57
I guess there is not enough room in the blockchain for all that spam that is going on.

The problem is that you can never be really sure if it's Bitcoin Core or Blockstream communicating.
Also Wladimir is something like a Leader. He has only one policy: Stuff we don't want will not be implemented without 100% consensus.

@_date: 2016-02-25 10:51:40

see... old nodes don't understand segwit transactions because they are not compatible. What blockstreams segwit implementation does is making old nodes believe it's a valid anyone can spend transaction when it's not.
You call that compatible? Old nodes don't understand segwit transactions and they can't create segwit transactions. How is that compatibility? It's like a bluetooth headset that's compatible with your phone because it can pair with it but it can't play any music on it because it thinks the signal is just silence.

Yes, they are still compatible with the network but not with segwit transactions. Segwit is not compatible with old nodes, it just does not create a fork when it should be. This should be called a softhack not a softfork.

On another News: **Satoshi envisioned SPV clients!**
As Satoshi writes, "[the thin client] can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it." If we take "X" to be the "number of blocks added after it", then SPV essentially trusts that a transaction X blocks deep will be costly to forge.
