Kudos! Just tip the previous post twice and don't tip me!
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:07:34
Thanks. I took two from you! Cheers!

Yohoho! Haven't tipped anyone before. Will try with 5 satoshi! Typo error in the first attempt.
@_date: 2014-11-02 23:07:50
I would like to have some. Do I need to give you an "address"? 
A bit confused with the changetip thingy.

Happy Holidays! Merry Christmas to all.

Just purchased my first 100mBTC. If 1 bit becomes $10, I will be a millionaire!

Bitcoin is a digital cash system built on modern cryptography techniques.
It enables instant borderless secure transfer of values through internet with a near-free low transfer fees.

Congratulations! Thanks for sharing.

Maybe he is trying to crush the price before buying when "there is blood on the streets"?
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:23:57
It says "Tip has been successfully collected" but didn't show anything in the balance yet. So I am not sure if someone else got it first...
@_date: 2014-12-25 23:30:51
Thank you so much! Cheers!

I am using "CoinPocket" in iOS. It seems to work fine and I have my BIP38 encripted private key written on a paper.

7000 out of 7 billions 
= 1 in 1 million 
= 21 BTC lost per year
17,000 out of 7 billions
= 2.43 in 1 million
= 51 BTC lost per day...
Wait, what is the growth rate of human population?

Downloaded the Windows wallet. Here's a public address

My suggestion is to share the winning with everyone who participated, based on the "shares" they worked on.
Maybe to allow everyone to enter their bitcoin public keys? I am sure more people will participate and crack the passphrase sooner. The challenge ends on 01-Jan-16 though.
Maybe you can be the one to claim the 10 BTC from WarpWallet?

Thanks for the introduction.
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:23:06
I think I got a few but not sure...
Edit: I think I got 4 of them but not sure which 4. Cheers!

No internet for two days and Changetip has taken over the world!! 
@_date: 2015-01-22 06:28:38
How many "days" are there in the each "week" that you have just mentioned?
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:37:40
Upvoted! Tipping Friday!
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:41:35
This is fun!!
@_date: 2014-11-04 11:36:35
Cheers! But it didn't work.
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:30:31
Very suspicious. I wonder when will hackers empty Satoshi's cold wallets? Why is that the "cold wallets" nowadays are not as "cold"?
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:27:29
Well done! Congratulations!
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:26:25
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:29:18
hahah... I LOVE YOU!

Tipping Saturday! Good morning!

The pot address has started distributing bitcoin before the game even started....

Thank you for your generosity!
