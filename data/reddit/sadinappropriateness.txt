I like the post.
However, inflation as we have it in the U.S. Increases the velocity of money. This increases economic activity, which is a good thing.
When we used gold in the old days, people often just hoarded money which slows economic growth. That's why people were so poor they had to work years just to pay off their boat ticket from Europe or buy a tiny piece of shit land.
Bottom line: both bitcoin and inflationary currencies can exist together. Gold coins haven't made the dollar go away. And as long as taxes must be paid in dollars, it will survive.
Like real estate and gold, bitcoin will be another new option as a safe haven from inflation. Bitcoin is a powerful new tool, not the destroyer of worlds.

Every time bitcoin is up I think "if I sell I might lose out on additional gains".

The rich think like this: if I spent $1000, and now my gold is worth $99,000, then I'll loan out the $99,000 at high interest. Or I'll just hold onto my gold until it's worth more. 
Though, yes, they might spend it too. 
But with inflationary currency, like the dollar,  nobody with half a brain is sticking it under a, mattress long term. At very least it's in a bank account (which means it's being loaned out to generate economic activity).

Ha ha sure. 100k by end of next year is in the realm of possibility. $100,000 x 17,000,000 = 1.7 trillion market cap.

Here's how to buy on coinbase with no fee: 
1. Transfer dollars from your bank to coinbase. This will take several business days to process. 
2. Then transfer the dollars to coinbase pro (gdax)
3. Set a limit buy order just under the market price. You can cancel and set a new buy price at any time for free. 
4. When your limit order goes through, the seller will pay the fee, not you.

It costs more than $4000 just to mine a bitcoin now. It was cheaper to mine it in 2017.
Don't see it going much below the mining cost. 
As an asset , I see bitcoin being about the price it should be until wider adoption. (7-10k). It certainly can go back to 20k in the future as people recognize its potential.

For bitcoin to be worth $1 million, it would be nearly equal in value to all the stocks listed on the NYSE.
17,000,000 x $1,000,000 = $17 trillion
Value of NYSE stocks (google + facebook + apple + microsoft + etc     =  $21.3 Trillion.
Not gonna happen anytime soon, probably not in our lifetime.
100K is very possible, though, in the next few years/ decade. That's still an enormous return compared to stocks.

I'd say it's possible for bitcoin to be worth 50k - 100k in 10-20 years. So, if you had 2 bitcoin at $100,000, then that's $200,000. Of course, there's inflation. So,  might buy a small house somewhere. 
Even .5 bitcoin is something. Only 42 million people can own .5 bitcoin, although realistically since there's whales and lost coins, the number is lower. Even so, 42 million would be less than 1% of the world.
5 bitcoin would be a nice nest egg. But not everyone has 30k usd lying around, or is willing to risk it. There's still a chance that governments will outlaw bitcoin, although I'd say it's dropped below 25% at this point.

Strategy, never sell at a loss. If the price goes down drastically, buy more.
1 btc @ $10,000 + 1 btc @ $5,000 = $7500 average you paid for bitcoin. 
When the price goes back up to $10,000 someday (might be a year or a month) you can sell for a 25% profit, which is 2.5 years worth of profit in the stock market world, on average.
Don't sell at a loss unless you have solid evidence that the price will remain low for many years, and you are going to buy near the bottom.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:49:11

Ok, but that is represented by US government bonds. I doubt bitcoin will have the clout to be worth as much as government bonds.

We have futures traders shorting us on the CBOE effing us up... don't think that the US government couldn't shred bitcoin if it decided bitcoin was a threat to US bonds.

I don't think this ban prevents crypto websites from running adsense ads to make money. Just that the ads you will see on crypto websites (like coinmarketcap) will be for non-crypto things like movies, cars, etc.
ICOs and such will have to directly contact the exchange websites to advertise separate from Google.
ICOs will rely on forums and crypto websites like ICObench to find investors.
And obviously, crypto ads won't show up on google searches, which might be good because a lot of those ads are scams. I don't like the authoritarian, anti-1st amendment aspect of this ban though.
1. Less crappy ICOs being hyped 
2. Legit crypto websites having to find new advertisers, and therefore struggling financially in the short term.
Just my thoughts. I am NOT an expert, though I have bought some google ads before.

If adoption increases, then Bitcoin could be used much easier than a CD, physical gold, ETF, stock, etc to actually buy things. When's the last time you used a CD to buy a sofa or a house?
Something that can be used to purchase everyday items, but that is deflationary... pretty attractive.
Bitcoin has the potential to be:
1. True international currency (not controlled by any one country or group like the EU)
2. Investment / deflationary
3. Digital (unlike gold)
4. Can be used to buy everyday items from everyday people
My prediction is that bitcoin will stay in the $5,000- $10,000 range for the next few years before slowly edging up to $20,000 and beyond by 2030. Its meteoric rise is over, but some of the altcoins like Ardor have the potential to go 100x

Um, who thinks in Pesos? What in the world is valued in pesos? It's always dollars, euros, possibly yen. Even bitcoin isn't valued in Pesos.
If the value of a peso goes way down, a bitcoin will still be worth $6,000 and it will still take at least 20 of them to buy a lambo. The value of a peso doesn't effect the number of dollars or bitcoin that a lambo costs!!
Again, if all bitcoins ever equals $17 trillion it will be worth all the stock in the world. 
Sorry, go back to economics class.
@_date: 2018-07-20 22:45:21
So would it be good to have something that is accepted as currency internationally, that also is deflationary? 
BTW, the dollar doesn't count as money because it's not a good store of value.
"To act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved – and be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. The value of the money must also remain stable over time. Some have argued that inflation, by reducing the value of money, diminishes the ability of the money to function as a store of value."

I think bitcoin, like gold has a place in the economic ecology. The dollar does too. I personally think its great to have multiple forms of currency. I think it's great to have thousands of cyrptos

Why is everyone selling at exactly 10,000 ?
Makes no sense.
1. If you sold at 9999.99 you're more likely to succeed.
2. Makes it harder for bitcoin to reach 10,000.
Sellers gotta smarten up.
Or maybe they want the price to go back below 10,000 right after they sell?
Well, if you sell some at 10,000 and hoping to sell some higher, sell the first at either 9999 or 10001.

Good point, but my point still stands. Those people can HODL because their overhead to buy those coins was low. 
Yes, they can sell at any price and still make a profit. Unlike newly mined coins which really need to be sold for around 5-6K minimum to break even.
Also, a significant portion of those rich wallets are probably owned by exchanges.

ok fine, you buy crypto. Or is it cryptocurrencies? But some aren't. Or is it tokens? Is it coins? Or is it blockchains?

Once general internet identity security advances more, bitcoin security will follow. Already, coinbase is pretty secure with 3FA. 
Someday people will store bitcoin in their bank accounts and it will be FDIC insured.

Everyone in the world wins, as the people of the world have a currency that increases in value over time, rather than decreases, and is electronic (unlike gold) and decentralized.

Right, but I'm talking about things that have high liquidity, are very valuable, and especially for investing in blockchains. The pound and euro would also qualify.
I'm already involved in some real estate related investments so I don't need to go there right now.

I was thinking of selling my bitcoin, but then I realized that when bitcoin goes down in value, all my altcoins go down in value. 
Don't sell low! Save the alts!

I guess I didn't consider this, though I know about the bots. Still, seems like an inorganic pump to me. Many crypto experts feel the same way. Covering the shorts might be a big factor too.
Still, that's a very quick rise. $1,000 in 45 minutes!!!!

I didn't say I'm not cool with the rules. Grow up dude. I'm just having a conversation about what's going on. Do you also believe in not learning or discussing things? 
Let me see. Here are your beliefs:
1. don't talk about manipulation
2. don't talk about anything
3. don't learn anything
4. if it's not bitcoin to the moon, then it's lies

This is awesome!! You should put the bitcoin live price on there too.

I would have sold my bitcoin, except:
1. I believe in it, apart from making a profit.
2. I realized it's way easier to buy altcoins with than USD.
3. It has a great record of going up in value long term. Though I think annual gains can't be as extreme as it's been (if it continues the way it has it'll be worth the entire world's real estate in 8 years), it'll still increase long term in value, probably better than most stocks.
4. If I hold USD long term I KNOW FOR A FACT it will lose value over time. Even in a savings account.
Having said that, If I were one of those people that took out a $40,000 credit card and needs the value to exceed 10K or they'll go bankrupt... I might consider selling, as there's no guarantee it will exceed 10K real soon.

With all the money miners have invested, they can't afford to sell bitcoin for less than about $6500. 
Only a few cheap electriciy countries can afford to do that. And those people are rich enough to hold their coins for a decent price rather than sell cheap.
We're getting to the point that a lot of people can't sell for much less than $6500, unles you are holding bitcoin that you bought back in 2017. Most of those people aren't in a hurry to sell cheap either.
The price could only go below $6500 if the people that don't have to sell decided to sell en masse. Or people just decided to sell at a loss.
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:38:58
Ok, tell me how it's naive. Keep in mind that I just got nearly a perfect score in my College Macroeconomics class. Ok, it's no longer as decentralized as would be ideal. But it's more decentralized than regular currency, but less decentralized than gold (unless you count gold mining operations).

If the bears win, price is $30,000 in 5 years. If bulls win, it's $35,000. 
So you should sell, to me. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:01:42
This is a bull market. We've rebounded off of the obvious floor of 6500. Now that a floor is established, the bulls can take over. Things look good for crypto, though we might go back to the 7000s at some point if there's bad news in the real world. For example if the stock market collapses or the US bans crypto, or Tether gets subpoenaed again. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:06:49
The cool thing about bitcoin is that it's nearly pure abstract value. 
Which is why it's so valuable.

Why did the price go up about $1,000 over the course of 45 minutes a day ago????!!!!
Who did this? What are their intentions? 
They obviously wanted to make a point or they would have done it quietly. This is a pump, but will they keep pumping??
There's evidence that the dollar value of the pump is equal to the amount of Tether moved around in the official Tether team wallets.
I'm not saying a pump is bad... we need it. But was is their end goal?

Weird thing about bitcoin price dropping...
It causes altcoin prices to drop immediately in value... 
Which causes altcoin holders to want bitcoin or USD, thereby increasing the value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:18:06
I think many Alts are overpriced (but not all). Remember, the coinmarketcap.com market cap amount is based on circulating supply not total supply!!!! 
For example, Ontology 112,619,658 ONT circulating, but total are 1,000,000,000 ONT. So true market cap is about $8,600,000,000. Ontology could someday be worth much more, but it's speculation on a company with no final product yet.
I'm not bashing ontology ( I might buy some), but these valuations are in the range of some established companies with profits, real estate holdings, etc.
(BTW I like Ardor because it has a working product and is cheap, though their marketing sucks)
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:52:27
I can't withdraw my Ardor, though that's true for everyone on HitBTC right now.
My recommendation: pay a lawyer in the country that HitBTC is registered. Have that lawyer send them a letter asking for your Bitcoin.
See if they respond to that.

I think we know what's going on to bitcoin now, people! 
P.S. This is probably incorrect, but I had a dream where it was like 2050 and Bitcoin was the world currency. And I was telling my grandkids about the time where we had to go to a thing called an ATM to get paper to pay for things! Then I took my grandkids to get ice cream in my flying car.
Whose dream do you like better?

Everyone needs to stop selling at exactly $9,000.
Sell at $8995, $8999, or $9001.
By creating a huge sell wall at exactly $9000 it makes it very difficult for the price to go over $9,000. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:10:23
Apparently 1 bitcoin is worth exactly $9400

I'm not saying it should be made illegal. I'm just saying that it's happening. And it's considered market manipulation.

It depends on what exchanges you are looking at and the situation, and which pairs. There's no true price for anything.
