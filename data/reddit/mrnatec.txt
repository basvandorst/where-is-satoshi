Block chain should be for a few other coins too. It's SOOO easy to implement.

I actually had 4000 BTC but I got held at gun point, and robbed. I asked the police to help and even gave them a tip of 10BTC. They took it and never helped me. Apparently they had champagne on a Friday night with my BTC if rumours are true. I went down a couple of weeks later to complain at the front desk only for them to lie. They claimed that I didn't report it and I never gave them any BTC.
I checked the blockchain, printed it off and took it back down. Showed them proof. They arrested me. I was being booked in when a small guy came in with a French accent. I was eves dropping their conversation. Guess what, that was the guy. That fuckin' piece of shit next to me was the person who stole my BTC. I raised my voice to stand up to freedom. There was no way I was letting this fuckin' dog take my money. I got on one knee and punched him in the bollocks. *whamm* he hits the floor like a bag of spuds.
I start getting angrier and angrier and I proceed to kick him in the face *wham, POW*  all of a sudden there's 10 police officers grabbing me and putting me against the wall, my arm up in the air and in pain. That week I lost 4,010 Bitcoins, got a criminal record and a suspended sentence, on the upside  I met Karpeles.

Thanks bud... 2 questions:
How big are the wallet files, 'cause I need to buy an sd card to plug in to a usb adpter to back up the file.
Does the rasp version allow usbs to be connected

Also the design:

Centralized data, Facebook, Google are all centralized, yet I bet you still use them too.Encryption doesn't hurt too, bet mtgox wish they encrypted their users' data.
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:21:28


Try that.

A cheap rasbery pi with bitcoin armory, and on an sd have the wallet.dat file One SD card for your will, one for yourself.

Or will miners carry on mining for the fees? If this is the case, will the mining difficulty stay the same, lower or keep getting higher?
@_date: 2015-02-25 21:42:18
2 slices of pizza for $6.50 that seems a little expensive, no?
@_date: 2015-02-11 23:03:53
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:55:16
Also, is this $30 split between all 6,000 nodes or individually? 
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:46:34
I think you have to keep your address in your static page or it resets.

It's a joke BTW (if you can't figure -- even tho' those paint skills are amazing, bruh)

I guess, unfortunately, I have sentences, and I've heard the results are laughable, I'm too scared to have a site that in English says:
Welcome to Cryptxe Exchange, trade cryptocurrencies. 
and then translated looks like:
"Welcome to Trade, Cryptxe Cryptocurrencies" 
@_date: 2015-02-06 06:41:38
Append: I used google to translate: "We are responsive" and the results were "We are responsible." Albeit we are both, but not quite the results we were hoping for :D

At the moment there's two options: for Bitcoins it's the usual way via your client and/or wallet. For fiat we are using OKPay. we plan on allowing visa's and wire transfers in the future; we just need a good partner whom is willing to join us.

On page visit, generate a BTC address with getnewaddress()
and insert it in to the database. assign that address to a session or cookie variable if you don't allow the user to register. Before they are allowed to deposit force them to add a payout address in case they ever accidentally delete the cookie and/or session of their address that they might've already deposited to.
Now, when they deposit, have a cron job script to list all transaction listtransactions('',2000); with a while or foreach
Check that the deposit has 2 confirmations before adding the received address to the database.
Now update the user to let them know it's accepted and to create 6 numbers (or you could do it on deposit -- that's up to you)
Fetch the total lottery balance from the database, add new balance to old balance:
$new = $total-&gt;total + $tx['amount']; //equals new lottery balance
Now every month or whenever have a timer to lottery draw count down, and use a function to pick 6 random numbers. Check database for those numbers if you're having one main winner, or a function to check 2,3,4,5 and then work out a percentage, check the database table for those numbers, match received address with payout address, check wallet balance, give them coins.

:( I'm not sure man, I'm sure it's the right link 'cause someone was in there before.

My tutorial on how to set it up for windows:
Download curl:  (make sure you download the ssl version"
Once download open the ZIP file, and go to start &gt; computer &gt; c:/ and drag and drop the exe in there. 
Download xampp: 
Run through the instalation, once installed open: 


 and edit the index file, place the bitcoin address your want to use as your payout.
Now (I can't teach you how to do this, but forward your port 80 to your machine that is running xampp.)
Now that is done, go to start &gt; cmd and open it.
    cd c:/
    curl -k --header "Accept: application/json; indent=4" --data "bitcoin_address=replacemewithyourBTCaddress"     
Replace the BTC and ip address above. and copy and paste that in to the CMD windows and press enter

Lol like they'd be capable of finding out if the client has any Bitcoins.

Will chinese companies be regulated by these if people from new york use their service?
@_date: 2015-02-01 01:02:00


Not really. Just a simple copy and paste of the source code, they've not even bothered changing the linked urls in the source, the only link they've change is the login form action to direct to their phisihing code, that they're probably too thick to write themselves and just C&amp;P'ed that too.

I don't know if it's available for selling stuff in Australia, but there's a site called Gumtree. For payments I don't think there is. So I just do bank transfers or Bitcoin.

I'll be releasing it for free once it's done :) Then people will be able to use Bitcoin instead of Fiat.
