I think it is insane to think that BitCoin will win out against all competition simply because it was first. First guarantees you nothing in the age of the internet. 
BitCoin is a technology.. Technologies come and go at a rapid pace. If an alt coin comes around that is faster, greener, and more secure, I wouldn't dismiss it for some dogmatic hope-laden belief that BitCoin is too big to fail.. (I often find myself chuckling at the irony of bitcoin enthusiasts belief that bitcoin is already too big to fail.)
The real reason most BitCoin folks tend to believe BitCoin will always win is because BitCoin folks are young. Everything is the next big thing and everything is here to stay forever. Stick around the world of technology for long enough and you see things move and evolve at a tremendous rate.
BitCoin is awesome, but it is no more secure than alta-vista. Google beat it out by being FASTER and BETTER. 
It should also be mentioned that the infrastructure being built around BitCoin can be adapted to a new digital currency with a few strokes on the keyboard. The game is just beginning.

I'm a BlackCoin spammer as well, but this is legitimate news. If Bitcoin continues to ignore alternatives it does so at its own detriment.
There are problems with PoS, that is a certainty. There are certain centralization issues. But Bitcoin has those issues as well, but they manifest themselves more slowly (centralization of mining power). It is important that altcoins exist right now. Without them, Bitcoin would grow complacent. We are the testing grounds for new features and technology. We adapt. Google Cooperative Proof of Stake. 
There are definitely good, achievable ways forward that do not require a needless consumption of power, and we will prove that. You can ignore us for now, and call everyone in the altcoin world a spammer. But we are promoting and developing legitimate innovation. We work hard at this, and we would like to at least be attacked on merit. 
There are plenty of arguments to be had, but to have most Bitcoin enthusiasts just close their eyes to the problems and the POSSIBILITIES is not healthy for digital currency. Let innovation continue to prosper.

There are a multitude of workarounds for this issue that are nearing the testing stages. If you want to PM me I can direct you to a few whitepapers on the subject.

I could be wrong here but I believe you can at least mitigate this issue by scheduling/building contracts for portions of an agreement. (Continuing web design example)  For instance, 1 BTC for completion of mock-up, 1 BTC for back end database, 1 BTC mobile version etc. By negotiating checkpoints you minimize the risk.

Perhaps I should have stated one of the first, or first in the US? I tried looking into this a bit before posting but it seemed all of the companies that actually claimed to accept BitCoin were just online publication companies that passed things along the wire, not actual PR companies.
And not to downplay your example, but that is a three man company.. I guess there are some asterisks I should have added to the title but they are definitely the only PR Company accepting cryptocurrency that is doing an AMA tomorrow. :)

I'm not actually a spammer. I think I've posted here once before? How about "I'm a BlackCoin lurker."
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:43:07
BTC is already stuck. There are adaptations that can be made right now to make it better... We all know this? Why don't they? Because they are too big to be fast! (The irony continues:))
Look at the responses to this system.. which (although untested and unwritten) is clearly better. The overwhelming majority say "Looks good but not gonna happen."
Look BTC is great. Hands down, its a game changer. But why are people so afraid of competition? Makes very little sense to me. We are supposed to be a group of free thinkers and the sub reddit rules say "don't you dare mention a different digital currency".
It's a bit off.

Litecoin really has no value anymore. Nothing will be ASIC resistant in the long term as a recent ethereum post (I believe) pointed out. NXT and BC are probably the two next most innovative ALTs. But, obviously, I am biased.

I came here to trash the article, glad to see reason has already found its way into the comments. The sheer amount of circlejerk'ing in r/bitcoin gets me worried from time to time. It's nice to see that we are still, at the core anyways, an intelligent group of rational thinkers.

I believe he is the chess guy... But only because I saw him talking about chess in irc. No evidence besides that.

A desperate troll looking to distract from the facts and drag me into an argument about nothing..
Seriously, this has nothing to do with ANY altcoin in particular. The link I posted was a proposed hard fork of BTC itself.

Alright, I am a large holder in PoS. That's my bias so let's get that out of the way...
Why is a straight PoS not advantageous over any sort of hybrid? As these other coins get eaten up by more and more mining power driving their price down doesn't it make sense that a PoS is going to slowly eat them up? With multipools that dump straight to a PoS coin (mine most profitable alt, sell to BTC, sell to PoS) I don't see how they aren't going to take over as the crypto world continues? Alts will have to diminish.. we already have too many with more coming out each day...
What am I missing? Not selling anything I'm looking for a discussion...
@_date: 2014-07-10 17:14:04
I concur here. These issues are being resolved and some ardent PoS detractors are beginning to see their arguments crumble a bit. I am certainly not ignoring PoS coins simply because they are PoS anymore.

Nightrader public beta was scheduled for today. I think they may miss the mark but from what I know they are nearly there.

The title could be "Alan Greenspan Explains why BitCoin Will Never Compete with Credit Cards" and the logic would be much more sound.
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:47:03
Greenspan said 'by being more widely acceptable'. I would argue that a digital currency should be as fast as a credit card for it to be 'widely acceptable'. I just don't see people changing for less convenience, but call me crazy. 
By your argument I can say BitCoin will NEVER EVER make it because Cash/Credit Card is more widely acceptable. 
Open the mind, it is ok to think something is possible even if that something is something you really don't want.
@_date: 2014-05-19 18:55:10
Do you have an example or proof of this? 
@_date: 2014-06-03 02:50:55
I'm a BlackCoin groupie so you can downvote me all you want.. But I, and a whole lot of others :), have worked so hard to make BlackCoin a success it's just awesome to see us mentioned up there with some of the bigger alts.
I'm so excited CitiBank noticed us.. That is all:)
