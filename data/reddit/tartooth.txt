They are controlling when people can buy/sell

Watcher/holder/trader, since 2012
All I can say is this : When the big price movement (as in, started to climb to 10k happened) I said one thing. This is looking exactly like 2013's pump.
Well, go look at the charts, we're in for a little more excitement then a downward degradation until the next big pump if it happens.
To any investers, listen. Sell it now if it goes back up to 12k, or get ready to hold for another 3 years and not watch the price.

Theft as in, internally.
Think, Mt.Gox, Mintpal, Cryptsy, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:18:03
Sure, but when they lock it for say, half a day... thats a big sign vs say, for a few minutes as they load up more bitcoin from either buying more from somewhere else (having large swaths of fiat on standby from buy orders) or loading up from cold storage.
If they have such bad liquidity that they need that day's buy orders to buy coins, then theft has happened somewhere, or the company has cashed out.

Profits, or fear. There is a good chance that 
A) They don't have the bitcoin required in their hotwallets (theft)
B) They don't have the fiat required to send to bank accounts at the rate people are cashing out (theft)
C) They are profiting off making people wait with their buy/sell orders

I've had 2+btc stolen in various ways from **exchanges** over the course of my BTC career. It's the  threat to BTC in my opinion.
Seeing it now reach where it is, I am furious at the amount of money I've lost out on from petty shit as








And more!

This is a hard repeat of post 2013, pre 2016/2017.
It's gonna rally until the whales deem the market is ready to bare another huge pump
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:46:45
One second, I'll draw you a little example of where I am talking about.
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:09:04
/dogecoin reference!
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:37:33
vircurex has good reliability unlike cryptsy
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:15:24
Doesnt matter. The fact you already are heavily influencing the media in a way that favours your companies interests. The damage is done, good play
@_date: 2014-02-27 12:30:59
This is a killer story for him then. If he can stir some FEAR into the bitcoin universe, then it will drive people to buy his bitcoin insurance.
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:53:34
same, here :(

How would you transfer the USD without paying an arm and a leg?
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:41:35
You are a terrible troll *sigh* 
But whatever, because your post is heavily downvoted, which just further proves you sir are a huge fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:11:56
Soo what does this mean exactly?
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:10:44
Sooo how are you feeling now that it is continuing to drop :O
(Please tell me you are holding!)
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:07:20
Just crazy to think that, thats how some people get paid. 
Art is so awesome, if you know how to sell it ;)

I was thinking of cold storaging my funds two days ago but figured I would trade them soon.
What a mistake that was. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:42:38
wait, I could have bought gox.com?
Damnit!

So, he spent 125k on a piece of canvas with the identical symbol on it?
I CAN DO THIS WTF!?

@_date: 2014-03-26 15:29:52
I got .25 btc in coins there... 
This is the third time I've been burned by exchanges now. How can crypto continue the exchanges keep stealing them? (I honestly believe that most of these "thefts" aren't "thefts" at all and are just inside jobs)
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:56:39
Here you go, look at the time frames, your just mad because Dogecoin was able to do what Bitcoin took years to do. 
Stupid trolls/haters, don't understand that dogecoin is beneficial for all cryptos, ESPECIALLY bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:18:54
Dogecoin is following bitcoins chart almost exactly. 
Bitcoin had it's "kick off" then it declined for several months, then had another "kick" then declined for several months.
It's only been here for a few months, just watch it go back up just like BTC did
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:59:39
 what? Where?
@_date: 2018-10-04 13:33:07
My honest belief is it is going to bottom out around 3-3.5k in I think a year and a half, then rise slowly to another pump the following year.
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:57:47
Welcome to the "I've been fucked by exchanges" club
Got burned on several exchanges over the last year. It's the cancer of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-04-19 08:23:21
3000 this year, moonend of 2020
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:25:28
Last time we had the peak of 19k, a lot of professional investors toke notice, but didn't buy in. Guys who control million dollar accounts.
I think right now, they're the ones buying up all these cheap coins, and are A-OK with the market being unregulated. Paired with Chinese buyers, I think we're gonna see another surge in a year or two, and they'll have the capital to market it.
One the hype train starts, it's gonna be even more insane compared to last time.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:41:31
You should go look at dogecoin.
I sold at the first bump as it matched the usual pump/dump shenangicans. Then it went up from 400sat to 4000
@_date: 2016-07-22 00:32:36
what about engraved wood wallets? 
I mean, it's technically the stuff that makes paper... + I can make them in mass. Do you think people would buy them?
@_date: 2016-07-22 00:37:40
Not going to lie to you man, bitcoin has never been stable. "solid support" means nothing when a whale walks in with $100k in coins and dumps.
The most stable it was, was when it was 2-$300 for almost a year when whoever is pumping right now was buying up coins and keeping the markets cheap so they could slowly buy.
