It's currently not much different than having a pocket full of $100 bills and trying to buy a beverage at a gas station where the clerk won't accept a bill larger than a $20. You have a sufficient quantity of money to buy the item, but the transaction won't go through none the less. Does that make your $100 bills not useful as a currency?
The slow transaction times and expensive fees right now are why a lot of people are seeing Bitcoin as a "store of value" instead of a "currency"; much like having a pocket full of $100 bills, the value is there, but the accessibility/liquidity may not be, at least not for small-value transactions.

Define "downtime". 
I had a transaction take 4 days to clear a few weeks ago. There are currently [over 100,000]( pending transactions on the bitcoin network; this value is more than 1/5 of the highest [number of transactions]( that have ever been processed in a day. Does a network that hypothetically delays processing (or fails to process) 1/5 of its daily transactions get to realistically claim "no downtime"?

Because it costs $50 to send any amount of money. It may cost $50 to send $5, but it *also* would cost $50 to send $5,000,000. While the fees are very high right now, bitcoin doesn't lose all of its utility because of that fact alone.

Never heard of that before, I'll have to look into it. Thanks!

I wish I could upvote your comment more than once. This is the crux of it. People got involved in a thing they didn't understand, then somebody who understood got involved, took action based upon a clause in the fine print, and now everybody that clicks "I accept the terms of the license agreement" without reading it is upset that somebody else read the agreement.

How can it fork in a decentralized way? The developers of the code determine whether or not if forks, and that puts ultimate control of the currency in the hands of a few. Sure, the adoption of the new fork requires many people to adopt the new codebase, and that may make it "decentralized" but it's *idealogically* centralized in that if you can convince a majority of users that a fork is a good idea, the minority loses. 
It's sort of (sort of) like two-party politics; 51% of people vote for team  49% for team  team  takes over and makes a bunch of new rules and team  has to abide by them.

Segwit is part of it, but another part is to look at where the volume is. There's been big interest from SE Asia. BTC/KRW is a Bitcoin and Korean Won trading pair. BTC/NEO is a trading pair between Bitcoin and a crypto called Neo, which was developed and released in China.

It did. It went from an ATH of $7445 about 3 hours ago down to $6900 about 2 hours and 50 minutes ago. It's now about $7200. You had your chance!

What *could* do that, though, is China making Bitcoin illegal again.

$300 of Bitcoin in July 2010 would have bought you 3,750 bitcoins, now worth nearly $22.5 million.


$300 of bitcoin in July 2016 would have been about 0.5 BTC, now worth about $3000.

It's infinite years of income. You don't spend the $1M, you invest it and live off of the growth in the investments. Assuming 1 million dollars well-invested and returning 3% or more annually, you can live off of the capital gains growth at a safe withdrawal rate of 3% indefinitely (3% of $1M is $30,000).

$50k annual net is above median income for the USA. $55k *gross* is median income in the states. You wouldn't be living a posh lifestyle, but it's certainly a livable income.

A "safe withdrawal rate" is usually 3.5% to 4.0% annually. On $3M that would be between $105k and $120k per year. has some information you may be interested in if this is a serious goal of yours.
