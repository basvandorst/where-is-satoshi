im just saying look how many issues we have with exchanges so far...people losing bank transfers daily, coins stuck in transfers, coins accidentally going to the wrong wallet, people scamming people for coins...all with ZERO protection or chance for recovery. Atleast if somebody attacks your bank account you have fraud protection. We have a long way to go with crypto that's for sure.

why did it say bitcoin was worth $40,000&gt;!?! is this the future bitcoin price?? lol
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:44:06
lol not even a whole bitcoin?? you're getting off cheap!
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:58:33
sell your bitcoin at market price or wait for price to go up then sell just like you would on any other exchange. Once you sell for USD transfer back to your bank account...pretty simple.

@_date: 2018-01-08 14:03:30
weird...there's 63,000+ bitcoin worth of TRX trading right now...i don't think i'd have any issues cashing out several thousand at the current time...
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:33:34
i feel dumb for buying more when it dropped to 290 and 260...lol shoulda just waited a little longer!

@_date: 2017-12-17 17:10:47
lol that's how much my boss is holding right now...he has no plans of cashing out either...he's been holding for a couple years now. I'm so jealous I used to make fun of bitcoin years ago. Wishing I would have bought a few back then...just like everybody else watching this boom...

I would hope you would be willing to take current market price. I doubt anybody would pay more than where they can already buy it at literally any other exchange on the internet...

it would be the equivalent of McDonalds being copied by somebody calling it McDonald's Hamburger shack and then trying to pass it off as the original McDonald's.
