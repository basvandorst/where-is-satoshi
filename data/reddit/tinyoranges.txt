Stop telling him/her what you told people to not do.

I wouldn't consider its feature set a problem because it stands is opposition in certain ways to Bitcoin. This critique is incredible vague. I don't know what you're getting at here. Of course you need to trust smart contracts. Why would you agree to a contract you don't trust? A robust feature set does not presuppose trust, or vice versa.


These two comments are not meaningfully related. Immutability is not a show-stopper when it comes to a store of value. In fact, it isn't necessary at all. Immutability isn't necessarily a good thing either.


Take a look at the Casper Proof of Stake implementation. Sharding, or some other form of partitioning is likely inevitable regardless of the data store implementation.

Please elaborate. This is incorrect on a number of levels; however I'm not going to refute your claim without really understanding what you meant.
