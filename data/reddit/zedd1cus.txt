Wait until it's no longer on hold, and send it to a bitcoin wallet. I'd recommend Atomic Wallet for Android/PC platform or a Trezor wallet if you want a physical hardware wallet.

Just because it's on an exchange doesn't mean it isn't mine.
If I leave them on the exchange indefinitely, then they are definitely not my coins.
However, I plan to transfer them over to a cold wallet - my keys. my coins.

A lot of traders have orders to sell their assets at the 9k mark as its a big point of resistance for BTC to break. This can cause huge price drops if certain wealthy traders are pushing hundreds to thousands of tokens in few transactions 
What makes the price go up is the amount of people buying into BTC and HODLing. 
Truly a whale's game. Nothing more, nothing less.

I've already experienced 10% dips within the past 3 months. 
I'm more or less in this for the long haul.
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:21:39
EOS is pretty undervalued still, its more of a long haul investment - and at the worst case scenario, any investments in it could just be seen as supporting the technology. 
But right now BTC is bullish af and I cant miss out on this.

I made a bunch of money off a sports betting site which cashed out in BTC. i made ~$600 worth of BTC off a $20 initial starting deposit. BTC was $5k at the time. BOY I SHOULDVE HODLd
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:50:23
The delegated proof of stake is a much more efficient way to confirm transactions, staking RAM/CPU makes transactions super quick to occur. 
The dev team being backed by a LOT of money, even Peter Thiel has faith in the project. 
It reminds me a lot of Ethereums startup, but with a much larger IPO. 
The apps being made on the ESOIO network are really neat as well. 
A lot of people who invest in altcoins have a significant amount of their money in EOS because its one of the most promising ones out right now and its under $10/token.

I might do dollar-cost averaging through Coinbase and transfer my btc into a Ledger Nano
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:52:13
CashApp: Charges no fees for buying or selling - can send it to other addresses
Coinbase: Charges fees based off of volume - can send it to other addresses
Robinhood: Charges interest and doesn't allow you to send your BTC to other addresses
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:14:11
I know it defeats the definition of a bull run, but id never pour high volumes of money into an asset that is climbing to new ATHs, id wait for the dip or do dollar cost averaging with conservative amounts of cash 
I don't know how someone could put 350k into btc at 17k rip
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:53:51
$200k in 2011 would give me 10k tokens which today would be $99,320,000

@_date: 2019-06-22 15:37:22
cashapp isn't meant to be a wallet technically. 
It has no public keys available for your use.
You can buy the BTC in the app using a card/bank account, and it'll sit in your account until you choose to sell it via the app (better to sell on a low fee trading index) or send it to a wallet address
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:20:40
I originally purchased it on Binance with CC and transferred it to Coinbase after they blocked US users

New to crypto. What effect does decreasing the block reward in half have on the value of BTC?
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:20:49
Coinbase pro to sell and trade / cashapp to buy
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:36:29
That was the goal from day 1

For being 16 that's some decent side money.

Yeah I can see the differing of the fees are drastic.
Definitely using coinbase pro for buying/selling

btc must be a rich person's toy
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:00:37
Thanks for the info! I sold out EOS at a good time, because the b1 june announcement caused a 20% dump IIRC. the dApps created on the network are mostly just cheaply made mobile games that add no inherent value to the token. I hopped off the train completely as of recently. 
I dont know much about ETH other than its fairly large market share and token value, but centralized crypto is not my cup of tea. 
Bitcoin and Litecoin it is!
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:50:13
coinbase pro has pretty low fees.
Way I see it, if I keep a rational percentage stop loss behind market price, and whales create a dump, I can always just buy back into the dip and if anything make a slight profit off the micro dips
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:19:24
I was going to do a $100/mo recurring payment for BTC and LTC

Around the $4.5k mark after it broke the 3k resistance
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:22:07
Not cashing it out, I'm in for the long haul. 
I know it's suppose to replace fiat in the future when mass adoption happens.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:47:48
Sold at a limit order of 13.5k and then bought on a limit order of 10.5k 
Its fine to sell if you feel that the price is hyper inflated - +20% in the matter of 24h is not healthy and is due for a correction. It was inevitable. 9-10k appears to be our support net now though which was something we were all waiting to break a month ago.
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:18:08
Or get more people coming to your gas station who use Bitcoin. 
If costs are paid off and you have an asset that exponentially grows over time, it's by all means a perfect idea.

Traded in my EOS for more BTC on Friday, boy was that the best decision I made yet.

Bitmex vs coinbase pro?
Coinbase pro I can just transfer my assets over with no fees and trade with that.

cuz gainzz
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:13:40
Obviously a centralized server is out of the question if EOS is meant to be decentralized, you're correct in stating it - but delegated proof of stake is the most efficient transaction confirmation system any decentralized cryptocurrency could have at the moment. 
Dev team being backed by a lot of money is just generally an overall positive thing. They're at constant work on the EOS platform. Lack of funds would never be a reason why EOS would fail if it ever does. 
I have faith in smart investors such as Peter Thiel, yes. 
EOS's startup doesn't just remind me of Ethereum's. I'm sure you were active during 2016 to compare the two. 
Any crypto is only as valuable as the money that is put into it. Its up to the community at the end of the day to add value to it. Bitcoin has value because people believe it does. Same goes for anything else. There is no physical asset to back crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:53:25
I've read that a lot of people prefer Trezor over ledger even for ease-of-use and the overall UI. 
Isn't it also like 50% cheaper?

If I put $200 in 2011, I'd have $131,000 oh boy.

I get scammy vibes from these sorts of establishments, they must charge a ton of fees for your purchases to keep the physical building running.

have limit buy orders in place to negate losses as well maybe?
im no expert myself heh

Would you consider ETH and LTC worth investing in? Or should i keep it strictly bitcoin. 
I bought EOS at $4/token and cashed out when it pumped to $8 before the Block.one June 1st announcement. 
Some alts just seem like short term investments
