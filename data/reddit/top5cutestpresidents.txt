large storage is already cheap. large efficient storage is not though. technically we could take a blockchain made of 1tb blocks and store it on a garage full of cassette tapes right now if we wanted. there won't be multi-petabyte SSDs cheap enough for home use for some time most likely. 
also as I understand it, variable blocks still have an upper limit. BTC has variable blocks I believe but all recent blocks have filled up. Someone correct me if Im wrong.

not if I copy and pasted it. Besides, I could just check the transaction on the blockchain. Itll be there just with 0 confirmations. This sounds like some noob fear.

how exactly did they track you down? did you go posting your wallet address in public forums or something?

ikr. check the first and last 3 or 4 digits, looks good, done. step 3 sleep like a baby. 
I bet half of these transactions are going into exchanges trying to get in on litecoin. that'd be my guess.

just send a tester payment first. no need to spend days checking that you haven't accidentally switched a letter to an identical-looking letter with a different ascii value.
