 Some of the justification in the message seems odd. 


It is worded quite poorly... 
The system used quite a bit of auto-checks (2FA/Anti-Phish/Auth Management), I am just baffled by how this happened. It's just...odd that this is timed merely a day into a ATH on the markets.

**edit: for those who take security and the safety of their coins seriously, you need to either get your coins off the Internet or be forewarned this may happen to you. If this was indeed a hack, he provides you with no peace of mind about your e-mail address. So be certain you don't share that with other exchanges. And if this was indeed a hack, this is a poorly managed message that gives absolutely no details about the breach and is absolutely not transparent by any means**
edit 2 - edited out incorrect context in which I quoted him

This is actually one of the big reservations I have for the currency.

This is getting ridiculous.

Or he could just look on Wikipedia. Seems like he's been following that resource for many other things lately. &gt;:P

Ah I'll remove that :) Thanks

You might not know this, but 4CHAN has a certain culture involving memes. Do some google searches on why they banned it, it might explain better than I can. IIRC 4CHAN just became a "If I get doubles, or triples - I'll do this..." and it just drove people away from the site. Same thing with reddit (why people unsubscribe from AdviceAnimals and the like).

Generate a Paper wallet with a computer connected to the internet only for this purpose. 
Create an address using bitaddress.org (don't forget a passphrase). Then generate a few addresses and print it out. Put it in a safe with a key. 
Make copies of the keys and keep them off the network.

Doubles were disabled because the meme became retarded. They've been disabled a lot longer than 6 months.

I was not making a commentary on the legality of it. I was talking about the misconceptions on what it is used for. Whether or not the government does anything is a risk people take if they put their wealth into this.

Haha, hey Jerry thanks for shouting out to us on C-Span! Appreciative!

I'm beginning to get real skeptical of these posts.
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:00:18
Thanks, I think this helps!

Probably because it wasn't a big investment in the first place. She didn't put a significant amount of wealth into them.

Welp! I created an account with them on Tuesday (along with many other services, to see what their services were like). Thinking about some faucets, maybe tinkering with the currency a bit. Thank god I use multiple sources of e-mails/passwords etc.  
Tonight, I look to get in on the action on Coinbase and see this. Now I am much more wary about this whole process (moving any of my fiat to btc). This is such a huge hurdle for the currency in general. I've known about BTC since the early days, but have held off due to these concerns. I am baffled by the amount of speculation considering these barriers that exist (where people can just walk off). 
Now I am not bashing the currency, but let me set the record straight: As someone who has all my wealth in fiat, and consider BTC as an alternative (for a small investment). I am rather keen to avoid BTC further. Why? Because if I hold any wealth in BTC, I really need to focus on offline wallets (and this IMO hurts liquidity). That's fine, and I may have to live with it, but it will hurt adoption in the long run.
This makes it very hard for me to pull the trigger on picking up a portion of a coin just in Coinbase alone. Or even dabbling with the currency at all. Because what if I pay my $ and during the next 7 days, Coinbase walks off with my money and BTC? It's a risk (albeit small). 
If and when I do think about pulling the trigger, I'll probably immediately withdraw to a paper wallet. And I guess that's the lesson here. Whether that's good for bitcoin or bad, is really up to the layman if we want BTC to succeed.

You don't need to donate to Seans Outpost after cashing out. Just send him Bitcoins.

This just sounds awkward. I think this is opportunistic by ASRock and that's just good business in some ways, but I will not be surprised someone buys it and something happens (BTC tanks or whatever else) where it ends up not being a "fortune."

Honestly, the biggest take-away IMO, to the layman invest who may be interested in learning more is, the information on Silk Road. By taking down the original Silk Road site, it did not hurt Bitcoin. So the entire notion that Bitcoin is some sort of secret currency used by criminals should be blown up to pieces. These guys did it very well in a short sentence.
I've had countless discussions with various people and they all have this incorrect notion. Dispelling it with two guys who are very professional on-camera does good things for the currency.

On  can someone please break down a little better [this chart](
Specifically, I am trying to comprehend the paragraph and I am not sure about the bolded part:




It's all one paragraph, so it's hard for my brain to break down what he is saying here. I guess what I am trying to ask is: **What is the correlation of the BARS to the LINES?**
