Im saying we dont have time. Bitcoins biggest advantage is its market dominance, which is dropping by the day. We dont have a year to fix this.

I've literally seen with my own eyes: videos, graves, mass graves, videos of dead people being shoved into mass graves, concentration camps, gas chambers, claw marks on the walls in those gas chambers, notes written by nazi death squads. I've spoken to survivors. 
If it didnt happen it would have to be the most elaborate ruse of all time, with literally every human being in the 1950s being in on it.

Not saying OPs proposal is right. Im just saying we can't afford to wait 18 months for the LN

Waiting 18 months in a heavily volatile market for a necessary fix is not a good choice.

Crawling back is the wrong choice of words. They likely manipulated the price to both sell bcash high and buy bitcoin low
