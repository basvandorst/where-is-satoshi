What you are saying makes no sense still. It will still be bitcoin, you would just close the channels
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:19:51
Think of gold.
Coinbase is he brick and mortar store that has gold and sells you. Thy need to make money, so they charge you a few bucks.
Gdax simply lets you in the back and connects you to other people who are selling and buying gold. Thy don’t do much work then, so they barely charge you.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:23:13
They need to own some to sell it.
They also need to own enough to make a difference.
They would also be going against the bitcoin trend of upward movement.

4% per year by banks is most certainly real. But after taking into account inflation of one year, you are barely making 2% a year. And here we sit on btc, and 2% a month is considered slow. What a time to be alive.

LTC has asic as well, you wont make anything. I would pick a coin that GPUS can do well in, such as ETH or XMR. If you want to mine with no trouble, just use Nicehash. Note there will be a 1-2% fee with Nicehash, but it might be worth it, since its so easy.

@_date: 2017-12-11 18:41:18
You can do the math yourself. Go back and pick a date. Pick and amount of bitcoin to invest st that time. Calculate how much you would have made from them. It will be less than the amount you would have if you just bought bitcoin with the full amount and held it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:43:24
The energy is less than that the banking systems of the world use at the moment. When you add it all up(banks, people getting to bank, transport vehicles to move cash, system and servers. Etc). Furthermore, electricity is not being wasted, it is being used to secure billions of dollars.
Miners have agreed to segwit, it is live right now, and you can use it if you want.
The confirmation time will not be an issue when we have off chain solutions such as lightning network.

If you do something big enough, and they put enough resources to find you, they will. Paxful will tell fbi the card number used. Visa will tell fbi which store you bought it, which date, and which time. The store will show video of you checking it out at that time. You can have other people buy for you, but that just adds layers.

You cant use them to prevent losses. You have to say, I will buy X bitcoin at Y price. If you think the price will be lower, then just sell now at a higher price.

Coinbase is fine. When you hit sell, they will take away your btc and start a transfer to your bank, which will take 2-4 days to clear.

@_date: 2017-08-18 23:59:40
"What if a bank takes your money?"
You're right, what if? Thats not what you asked. You asked why not leave BTC in coinbase vault. The answer is simple. They can get hacked (or pretend to be hacked), at which point coinbase will have your shared key, and coinbase key. With this information, they can send your coins anywhere they want. In short, you should not have your coins on coinbase, because you could lose them.

@_date: 2017-08-14 04:09:32
Hm. Bitcoin protocol tries its best to create a new block every 10 minutes. So if too many people start mining, the problems get harder, so it will take longer to find a solution. If too little people are mining, it gets easier, pushing it up to 10 minutes. 
What you are describing it called "halving", which occurs every 4 years (I think, not sure on time). This means that mining will get you half as many coins as a reward. So complexity doesnt have much to do with the number of blocks mined, but has to do with blocks being mined every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:41:06
Ya, thats all true, but doesnt really help explain much. Its all going to sounds like gibberish to "laymen". 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:18:25

@_date: 2017-08-22 19:47:10
Yes, which they would. Blocks will always be 10 minutes apart (expect when it has not adjusted yet).
My answer was assuming that no one at all mined, which means no transactions would happen.
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:01:32
They buy it from you with their cash, and sell it to others who "Buy" from them.
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:28:53
Depends how hard you try to be anonymous
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:40:08
What you are saying makes no sense though. You are not taking into account the fact that there are different blocks; not the same. These are going to be fake numbers, but it will give you the idea. If there are 5000 numbers to go through, the chance that you find the right one is 1/5000. Let's say you had 2500 machines, and you have each of them 2 numbers to check. This is the same as 2500 machines checking their own number for their own block; the probablilies are the same 
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:32:22
Because the hardware wallet does not take in any info other than simple transaction information. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:29:18
Actually, its more like 0. That 1 transaction is the miner paying himself. There are no rules in sizes of blocks, so you can mine empty blocks if you want.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:24:04
There are no redundant words. The 2024 words are all up and anyone can see them. It's like guessing the right number out of 2024 numbers right, 24 times. 
As an example to put this to scale: imagine if there were only 2 words. And you had to guess out of 2 words, 24 times. The first time would be 50%, then 25, then 12.5, then 6.25, then 3.125, then ..... less than .001%. 
Now imagine with 2024 words. The very first word is less than .05%. Then you need 23 more.

You are underestimating the power of SHA-256. We are no where near that. All banking and government use it as well. Bitcoin is a TINY fish in the pond of SHA-256 money.
If someone had the computing power to do that Bitcoin is that last thing they would go for.
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:03:42
Good shit
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:33:27
I think that bitcoin is worth much more than the current price however, which is why we see it increase so much all the time. Gold has reached its "price" and just grows naturally, which is why you dont see that happening. When bitcoin reaches its "price" we will not see these big movements. Im all pulling this out of my ass, so there is a chance im 100% wrong, but thats the logic I choose to put behind it :)
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:46:15
There is a shared key. What if they take your coins?
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:21:42
When you send bitcoins, there must be a return address. Most wallets create this address for you, and you cant see it. What you are looking at is one of the addresses in the ENTIRE wallet. There is another (maybe many) addresses that the wallet knows about, which also has bitcoin on it. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:51:12

Yes that's all. Nothing needed after that.
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:16:06
No. On average bitcoin has doubled every 8 months. It is high now, no doubt. And anything can happen. With that being said, I think it will continue to increase, which is why I keep buying more.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:41:20

Nothing really. They could put many resources and maybe find you for a crime big enough. Using addresses and subpoenas from exchanges of rhats how you go your bitcoin. Even then, if you are good they won't. 
That's the entire pout of crypto though.

@_date: 2017-08-24 23:39:37
Depends on the exchange. They all used to pay for you. Then fees increased. Now MOST charge you a medium fee. Some don't. Check online for your exchange and you'll see.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:19:43
And people don't need to. Lightning network is to settle payments off chains. This means that it would be mostly companies running channels with needed capital. Sending payments on chain will be the same as before, but much faster since those who are paying for goods that now have a LN channel won't be using the on chain option. There are literally no downsides.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:10:15
Yes, and I gave you another reason. At that point, your logic seemed to fail you. The point is that they can take your money any time they want. Once I gave you this, you asked "What if a bank takes your money"?

My advice is to try to not time the market.  Sure, it could drop $300 and you will save that. But it could also keep going up. If you are in for long term, $300 will not matter when each coin is worth so much more.

Okay. Listen here. You are probably using a martingale strategy. In order for this to work, you have to have an infinite amount of money. It seems like it will work. But you will get an unlucky streak.
Furthermore, this only works when you have a 50% to DOUBLE your money. In dice game, the house has an edge, so at 50% to win, you will make LESS THAN DOUBLE. Like I said, HOUSE EDGE will make you lose in the long term. 
Also, you said you need to lose 40 in a row? You seem to not know much. You need to lose WAY LESS THAN THAT in a row, and you will LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY. You double your bet each time, and eventually, you will get an unlucky streak. 
I can write a program for you, and demo for you to see. YOU WILL LOSE MONEY. You are either trying to scam people, or don't know about gambling. Either way; giving you money is a bad idea for anyone.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:04:35
I wouldn't do it. It works until it doesn't, and when it doesn't; you lose a lot more than you've made. Not to mention fees for buying and selling will cut into profits.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:13:58
Processing time will always be around 10 minutes. As far as fees goes, no one really knows. In theory it should get more expensive. For this reason, there are many updates being proposed for bitcoin (Lightning network, block size increase, segregated witness, etc). These all lower fees, but come with their own cons that I wont go into since its complex. Only time will tell.

So most wallets use he same word list. There are like 2024 words or something (round, don't quote me). But, the interesting thing is that these words are chosen carefully. They all sound different when spoke out loud, and all have different letters for the first four. This means you only need first 4 letters.

You are in mistaken. It's. it faster for 100 computers to work on a puzzle than it is for 100 computers to work on different puzzles. In a mining operation, not every computer is working on the same transactions.  This means that one once will work for one, but not for another.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:56:15
Any computer can mine bitcoin. With that being said, you will 100% lose money with it. It is no longer profitable to use your computer to mine.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:33:13
When a mining pool receives a new block from a competitor, it needs to perform a few actions: download the full block, validate its transactions and define a new block to mine on. During this - albeit short -interval, so as not to waste hashing power, they start mining a new block. Only the coinbase transaction is included, so the previous block does not invalidate theirs with a duplicate transaction.
Source: 
Essentially, while they are putting the blocks together (in order to mine it), they are also mining a block that would just pay themselves. Sometimes, that block is found before they put together another block. Rare, but it happens.

You can unplug and forget. You said you have the seed words, so you are good on that front. Nothing else you need to do. 
Private keys give you control of your bitcoin. You don't need to worry about this, since trezor stores the private keys for you. In fact, you cant even see them, since that would be a vector for attacks.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:18:40
I think the 24 word list has the same, if not more entropy than a private key. 12 word is still considered  safe though (which is what you have, I assume). 
You should do it again with a 24 word list, simply because there's no reason not to.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:44:22
If you are buying to make a profit, you would make more profit buying bitcoins directly. This will be the case until you reach several hundred thousand dollars, at which point it might make sense to buy mining gear ( and even then, it would take a while  I pay itself before you make real profits).

I would not use electrum. Although electrum does support trezor, I was merely stating what you could do in case the official trezor wallet stops working. The official trezor wallet (the website) is the best in my opinion.
Yes, you should move all your coins from wherever they are, to the address that the trezor wallet.
Before that however, I want to make sure you are safe. The only way to recover your bitcoin if your trezor breaks is the 24 word seed it told you to write down. Never tell those words to anyone. I just want to confirm that you in fact have those written down safely.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:22:54
The fee goes to the person/people that mined the block in which your transaction was in. If you are unsure what blocks/mining/nodes, then it’s a bit hard to explain. There are many pieces that all tie together to make bitcoin.
I would recommend trying to learn the basics of bitcoin, as it really ties everything together. I made a website a few weeks back to explain bitcoin simply, since I had a hard time finding simple explanations when I started. Check it out if you have time:

Buy a 3 pack. Store one in your household freezer for easy access.
Store the other deep underground (in a plastic baggy for protection) where the temps stay low enough for it to last a while.
Store the third in a remote offsite frezor with a backup generator. You can get one at lowes or home depot for a few hundred.

Ya. A quick overview is that since blocks have a certain size, only so many transactions can fit. Well there are more and more people trying to get their transactions in blocks, so how do we choose which transactions get included? We put a fee! Those transactions deemed not so important will have smaller fees, and rush ones will have higher! As more and more people want to send however, fees get higher, which is a big argument at the moment, on how we should address this problem. Anyways, 
Another cool thing about fees is that they will replace the block reward in the future. As you know, only 21mil bitcoin will ever be created, and every 4 years, the amount given to miners is reduced by 50%. Eventually the reward will be zero, and people will mine for fees
So fees do 2 things: 
1. They help identify which transactions are to be included in the next block, without discrimination.
2. They help pay for miners now, and more importantly, in the future.

I don’t know the situation you are in, but it sounds similar to me when I started. You find out about bitcoin, then about alts. You want to invest in alts because I you feel like they can give you the most profit.
What do you realize later is that 99.99% of alts are scams or fakes in one way or another. The entire alts market is gambling in my opinion. If you can find the few good ones, it may be worth your time, but at the end of the day, I’ve had the best luck just holding bitcoin.

People hype it up, and people buy. This causes the price to rise, and people are even more hyped. 
It is a feedback loop. generally it ends when things start to slow down, and just like people hyped the rise, they scream doomsday when it starts to fall a bit. This causes others to sell, and is also a loop.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:03:36
Yes you go to their website to send and receive bitcoin. If their website goes out of business, you can use the trezor or any number of wallets that support it(electrum is one example).
What the trezor does is simple. It HOLDS ALL YOUR KEYS INSIDE. When you go to that website, it cannot see your private keys. In fact, not even the computer you are plugged into can. This means that you can use trezor on a computer that has a virus and keylpogger and nothing bad can happen. 
When you unplug it, you’ll WOULD NOT be able to send bitcoins anymore, because nothing knows your keys besides the trezor device itself 
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:26:37

@_date: 2017-11-01 18:51:25
Yes, but when you sweep you move the coins into the address that the wallet generated. This means that if your computer breaks, and you generate the wallet, you will have the funds since you sent them to the wallet. If you simply manually added the address to the wallet, when you restore the wallet, that address would no longer appear. 
This is not a problem if you still have the paper wallet, since you can import it again. But if you lose the paper wallet and your computer, you lost the coin. If you sweep and lose both, you can still recover the bitcoin with the 24 word seed. :)

Lightning networks is (put too simply) a series of smart contracts built ON TOP of the blockchain. It has rules that everyone has to follow (like nodes). They are essentially a bunch of IOU's that many people have together. When the channel closes, the only transactions that need to happen are the ones to make the FINAL BALANCE correct. This is good because it saves many needless transactions from going onto the blockchain.

You won't make any money mining with anything you own. Mining now requires A LOT of capital and specialized equipment.

No it is not possible. When you broadcast a transcation, there is a list of checks that it must pass before a node passes it on to another node, which passes it to more nodes.
One of the checks is that the address you are sending from has the BTC balance. Another one is that the signature matches the private key of the public key you are sending from.

1. Can you send money to the nearly 4 billions people who dont have bank accounts? There are people in rural areas where brick and mortar banks cannot operate. Also people who can't afford normal banking fees. Also the fact that the government cannot take your money whenever it feels like it. Also the fact that it is a global currency, with no borders. Also the fact that it is deflationary, unlike any government issued fiat.
2. You are not paying the fee, the merchants are. The small company I work for pays 2.3% fees on all credit card charges. Of course we dont charge the buyers 2.3% as "credit card fees", but like most businesses, we find a way to slide that cost onto the buyers.
4. Exactly, Bitcoin is safe, user error is the only attack vector. No one is claiming otherwise. The fact is that Bitcoin (blockchain) is the base level. We are not yet at the point where big institutions are building onto the blockchain. If you know Computer Science, we are at the TCP level. Similar to the early days of the internet. The internet initially was not safe for users, nor easy to use. We build system on top of the internet. Then we build systems on top of those system. This is coming to Bitcoin. Things like Lightning Network is the first step. We are seeing the trickling of new ideas, such as new signature methods to make more transactions fit into less blocks.
5. Your money has not. Other peoples money have. If you live in the united states/germany/any first world country, it might be hard to see the benefit of Bitcoin, since, to be blunt, we have ti too good. There are other government out there that are straight up corrupt. Even in the U.S, a big market crash could realistically trigger a run on the banks. Scary stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:45:06
No, you would always be able to receive to that old address. Most wallets give you a new address, and thus a new QR code every time you get a transaction to it. 
If you send any amount to an old one, it will still show up in your wallet.

Correct. Wallets look at the mempool to see which transactions are pending. Because the transactions is not valid, not a single node would put it into the mempool.

"so even if we could broadcast a transaction it wont get confirmed"
Yes, it would never be confirmed (confirmed means included in a block)
"but is it possible to broadcast it"
Yes, it would broadcast to all nodes.
"and then it get disappeared by time becoz it didnt get confirmed?"
No. It would never dissapear beacuse it never appeared. Although you broadcast it (broadcast means sending out), not a single node would accept it as valid, and thus it would never make it into a mempool (mempool means the list of VALID TRANSCTIONS that might be added into a block if a miner picks it up) 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:16:07

@_date: 2017-11-24 07:47:27
BTC has been around a long time. People don't really fall for the "OMG ITS MOONING" as much, which stops the hype train from happening on such a large scale.
You can look at price history and see periods where it rises 25% in 2 days, but thats rare, and is usually followed by a correction (so in some sense, BTC has this too. Just much less often, and on a much smaller scale).
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:38:59
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:43:49
Not only will it not put it into the blockchain, it will also not go into the mempool. So while you do broadcast, no user would ever see it as even pending transaction.

Probably not. You can apply for several 0 apr cards though. Worst case bitcoin crashes and you live in debt for a long time. Best case it rises exponentially, and you pay off the cards at the end of the apr terms, making hundreds of percents.
Sounds like a risky idea, but with a big payoff. I personally would not do it, but of course it’s up to you.

I mention this because your question about satoshi nakamoto is a very valid one, and one that is answered on my website. I think the video will answer it better than I can, and it is very short. There are actually 2 videos which talk about the creator of bitcoin, so check them both out and let me know if you have any more questions I can help with!

Its fairly hard to explain keys in a technical sense, so ill use metaphors. Think of keys as a number. A number between 1 and 2^160 (1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976).
Your coins are stored on this key. So lets say your number is 43643653262346342354. Then "43643653262346342354" has a balance of 5 bitcoin. Anyone can type in the number "43643653262346342354" and spend your coins. There is no password. No protection. That is essentially a seed.
Now the first thing everyone thinks is, "HOW IS THAT SAFE!?!". Well the thing is, there are so many many MANY MANY numbers, the chance that someone picks your key is very small. So small, it is impossible in a sense (Not actually impossible, just REALLY REALLY unlikely). If you have a program searching all keys (1, then 2, then 3, then 4....) it would take longer the the life of the universe to search even a small percent.
It is hard to grasp how many keys there are. We are not very good at this as humans.
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:18:03

To be honest, most wallets are not good at determining fees. Really, you should be putting in your own fee, but again, most won't even let you do that. 
Fees are you paying for a spot in a "block". This means the more you pay, the more chance you have of being in closer blocks. It all depends though, because other people are trying as well. This means that the fee price will depend on how many others are trying to send transactions. These transactions are called "unconfirmed" when they are waiting to be put in a block.
I tell you all this because its not as simple as knowing the right fee, since there are many factors. If you are not in a rush to get it, I would recommend using an average wait time. A great website to see the "average" is  .
Go with what what ever option your wallet gives you that is the closest to that one, and you will almost always be fine!

It's easy to convince yourself when you don't see numbers. Ask her to make a plan, with exact figures. Such as I'll buy x btc at y price. If we take out a loan at z apr, and bitcoin drops to d, we will have to pay this much. If it drops to f, we will have to pay this much, etc.

I understand that, but for these to be useful, the private key has to be inside the bill somehow. 
My point 1 was that I don't trust other not to peek during the manufacturing process's. (And no one should trust other with anything, that was the point of bitcoin).
My second point was that even if MANUFACTURING was 100% safe (Which it is not), I would bet there are ways to either see the private key, or  tear it and repair it well enough to pass simple inspection.

@_date: 2017-09-19 01:00:42
To be honest, I don't see a market for this.
My main concern is the fact that someone else is handling the private keys. This leads to many vectors of possible attack, whether it be the manufacturer, you, or anyone in between.
Second, I don't see a reliable way to hide the keys, with proof that they have not been accessed(after being sold). I know it would be inside the bill, but I'm sure there are methods to either read information inside without tearing it, or tearing it carefully and putting it back together.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:57:06
Im too lazy to do the math, but think about it in terms of percent. From the day you bought it, how much % has bitcoin gone up?
Whatever that percent is, the value that you hold would go up the same percent.
EX: You buy $500 worth of BTC at $4000. If the price of BTC goes to $8000, thats a 100% increase. This means you increase your initial values by 100%. Which means your $500 is now worth $1000.

The that one individual would have all the bitcoin. That is what would happen in this imaginary scenario you came up with. In reality, this would never happen. 
For one, the price of each bitcoin would raise exponentially as each one is sold. Second there are many people would just would not sell their bitcoins. Second, there are many bitcoins tied up that have been lost, locked away, saved, etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:15:32

Coinbase is an exchange, not a wallet. Do not use coinbase as a wallet either.
Coinbase has the right, and has so many times in the past, closed accounts due to people sending BTC to addresses they don't see fit (gambling, blacksites, etc). I used coinbase as an exchange, and can vouch for them on that end.
I have never used blockchain as a wallet, but I would avoid that too if possible, since its online. Look into ELECTRUM for desktop, or breadwallet for IOS.
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:26:58
No, it will be good enough. There's no way for it not to be. Thats the entire point of difficulty adjustments.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:49:23
Ok. I'm going to give you the way I think is the best and safest for you. (Some would argue that a paper wallet is safer, but if you are new to bitcoin, there is a lot that can go wrong). We will be using a software wallet. It is called electrum and is the safest one in my opinion.
1. Download this software wallet. 
2. Run it, and name the wallet file to whatever you want (Name doesnt matter and wont effect anything).
3. Choose standard wallet.
4. Choose create new seed.
5. MOST IMPORTANT STEP IN THE WORLD HERE: Write down this seed on a piece of paper. This seed is essentially your KEY. Remember how important the key is (key=bitcoin, thats all you need to access it).
6. DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU WROTE IT DOWN RIGHT!
7. Enter the seed they just showed you. (This is there to make sure you have it. Write it down from the piece of paper). Quick note here. *Never type this seed into anything electronic after this. If you have a keylogger for example, they will see it. The point of the seed is to keep you unhackable from the seed point of attack.
8. Use a password you can remember. This password is just to access the file on your computer. If you forget it, that is fine, you can restore with the seed. This just makes it so if someone takes your computer, they cant access your bitcoins through the program.
9. You are good to go. At this point, I want to emphasize how important the seed is again. You want to have multiple copies of this key in different, SAFE places. If there is a fire in your house, and your paper with the seed burns, and your computer burns, there is no way to recover your bitcoin. 
10. Go to receive tab, and copy that address. It should look like this. *Dont use this address, it is mine, and you would send your BTC to me. Use the one it shows you.
11. Go to coinbase and click accounts, then send. Paste the address in there. Double Check it 5 times that it is the same lol. Enter the amount, and hit send!
12. It will appear in electrum, where you control the keys. From elctrum, you can send and receive all by yourself.
Ask any questions you have :)

So if you have bitcoin on coinbase, they have all the information to it.  Think of coinbase as your friend having your cash. On one hand, chances are that they won't take your money and run. But you never really know. And what if that money grows into millions? Are they still as likely to be honest and give it to you when you request it?
The general consensus is that you should move the money from coinbase(or any exchange really) to a wallet you control. A wallet that you have the private keys to.

Ok, read my reply above on keys. Once you know what keys are, then read below:
Coinbase currently has your bitcoin on one of their keys. You need to send it to a key you own. You have 2 options. You can make a key, print it out on paper, and send the coins to that. OR. You can download a program, and hold the coins on a thing called a wallet (Which has your key). I would recommend a paper wallet since it is easier to do. It is a HASSLE if you plan to spend them often though. Any questions on this so far?
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:41:16

When you get a hardware wallet, it creates its own set of keys. Then you send your BTC from coinbase to that key. At that point, it doesnt really matter what coinbase does with the keys, you are no longer using them, and they dont have any BTC on them. 
The backup is in the form of a seed (24 words you have to write down). With this seed, you can restore your keys on any wallet you want. As long as you have the keys written down and in many places (one at parents house, maybe one at an aunts house, any relative, or anyone you trust.)
As for the device itself, it doesnt matter if you lose/break that. The keys can be restored using the 24 word seed. If someone steals the device, they need a PIN you set, which can't be cracked.

All bitcoins are the same strength initially. You need to EV train them as they "level up" in order to get better stats. Try to get SPEED and ATTACK on your coins, since the order book meta is currently heavily HEALER based.

I understand what you think happened, but thats simply not true. That is not how coinbase works. Maybe you were confused with the fees you have to pay? Or maybe the fact that you actually buy at a higher price than the current coinbase price; and sell for less as well.
No one else has had this issue, and they do thousands of transactions day. I would look at the bitcoin and dollar values again.

When you bought, you got exactly what they told you you would get. That is the way coinbase has always worked, so you must have misread it.
As far as selling goes, it is the same thing. Your rate is locked in the moment you hit sell. They take away your BTC and will start the process to send money to your bank account.

Just ask him to tell you the difference between gold and bitcoin, other than gold being physical.
It is worth what people say its worth. As in, it is not good at anything in particular.
When it comes to conductors, we have cheaper and better conductors like copper.
When it comes to jewelry (appearance), we have Pyrite(fools gold), which looks the same way and is also cheaper.
When it comes to strength, we have MANY more materials that are cheaper and stronger (steel).
Gold has the highest corrosion resistance of all the metals and it is corroded only by a mixture of nitric and hydrocloric acid. Gold is a noble metal because it does not oxidize. The mentioned characteristics are enough to make a very useful and desired metal; thus, a very valuable one. Well, bitcoin most certainly does not corrode.
In the end, what gives gold its value is the fact that it is finite, impossible to replicate, and people believe it does.

Hm. It depends how much you have invested in my opinion. If you don't have much, then it is fine to keep your money on coinbase. Others will tell you even for small amounts you shouldnt, but they dont realize some people have a bigger chance of losing it themselves than that of coinbase getting hacked or scamming.
If you have a good amount however, you really REALLY should not leave it on coinbase. There is a hardware wallet called Trezor (there are other, but this is the one I use and can vouch for) that will take away ALL the hardparts of it. You are paying $100 for security and ease, but when you start accumulating bitcoin, the $100 is worth the peace of mind.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:23:31

It is what changes in order to get a new HASH number. This new number must be lower than the "Target Hash". This target hash is determined by the current difficulty of bitcoin mining. 
This difficulty changes every 2016 blocks. It gets harder if there is hashing power(machines mining) and easier if less hashing power.

No, they are not pre seeded. When you first use them, they generate the 24 words nemonic  randomly. The keys are generated every time you turn it on from the 24 words. They remain encerypted however, at all times. When you need to see them in plaintext, or when signing, they are decrypted, but never leave the actual device. There is a chip inside that does the signing, so your computer never sees the encrypted OR decrypted keys.

Yes, because any number has an EQUALLY likely chance to give a hash that works, you have to randomly guess numbers. This means that any one computer has a chance to find the right number. IN THEORY, the first number you try could be the right number. Or the second, or third, or fourth, etc.
So all miners are trying to guess random numbers, and eventually one of them will get the right number. Is does have SOME LUCK, but at the same time not really. If you have more computers guessing more numbers, chances are you will find the right number, but someone else can also find it before you. Think of the lottery. If you buy 1000 tickets everytime, you have bigger chance to win than someone who bought 5. But the person who bought 5 may still win.

"So it is a mix of "luck" and of having more computing power to being the one to mine the block first, but not too much computing power where the person has over 50% of the hash rate right?"
Yes it is a mix. If you have more guesses per second, chances are you will find it however. In theory, you could task your home computer to try to guess at numbers, but this will never happen (even though mathematically, it is technically possible). As far as the 50% goes, check out the video 51% attack on my website. Andreas can explain it much better than I can.
"How is this being checked ATM? How do we make sure no entity ever reaches the point of obtaining over 50% of the hash power?"
It is not. In fact, if some pools got together, they would have more than 50% of the network hashrate. But there is only so much you cna do, even with more than 50%. Again, the video explains what you can and cannot do much better than I can.
Couldn't someone rich enough buy a bunch of ASICs?
They could, but they would realize with that much hashing power, they would make more money mining that they would with what ever "attack" they tried to pull off.

I agree with that as well. It’s just that Bitcoin itself is very hard to explain in short terms. Sure, smaller topics such as fees, how a transaction works, what is decentralization; all can be answered fairly quickly. But bitcoin is all of those and more put together, so the real question is, how do we TEACH ALL those topics separately, then TIE them together. 
This is actually what the website aims to do. Similar to how math courses are taught. You learn the building blocks separately, then start connecting them and seeing the bigger picture. 
As for the question of whether I have built an interest on the website, I’m not really sure. I’m hoping to get as much feedback as possible, to try to have that. I hope people come to the website to learn what bitcoin is.

No, they don't exist decrypted, which is what makes hardware wallets secure. You never even see the private keys unless you ask to see them (which then decrypts it). 
Another advantage is that it generates new keys automatically, so you dont have to manage them. And it stores them all, in case someone sends BTC to an old address.

Hm, blocks need to be sent to everyone in the world every 10minutes. If you increase the blocksize, that means you are increasing the amount of data EVERYONE is sending to EVERYONE every 10 minutes.
Not only this, but it just isnt the right thing to do. We can make it more efficient by looking at code, and seeing new things to implements, such as lightning network and SEGWIT.
Another problem is that it may lead to centralization. It costs money to send data (bandwith). If you are small miner or node operator, you will need to send and receive the same amount of data as people with multimillion dollar capitol. This leads to companies with alot of money being the only ones that can truly mine on a large scale.

His actual question can be better answered with a simple video than any text comment saying 4 words. There are 5 types of wallets ranging in safety; each with benefits and draw backs. I have not seen a single comment talking about this. If you check that website, there is a video that talks in depth about this. I only post this comment on threads where the question can be answered with one of the videos. 
Videos are a great way to learn something, and half the comments on the question don’t get to the root of the problem.

Yes. When the fork happens, where ever the coins are, those keys get that many Bgold. If they were in your key, you have bgold, if they were not, then you do not.

If you mean selling, then it is instant. As in, when you sell, you will sell AT THAT PRICE, but it will take a few days for the money to reach your bank account.
TLDR: 
Sell is instant. Getting the money in bank account takes 2-4 days.

3. Do you have enough money in this, to justify a $100 insurance? As in, $100 will guarantee it is safe. (If you have $500 for example, $100 is probably not worth it. Some people have $5000 + and it would be..)

I use coinbase as well. You have 3 options.
1. use a credit card, which will give you the money instantly. This has the highest fee at around 3-4%.
2. Use your bank account to buy. This takes around 3-5 days, and has middle fees at around 1-2%.
3. Transfer money before hand with a wire transfer, and buy with actual USD after they clear. This has no fees if you use GDAX.
As you can see, you pay more fees for more convenience.
Once you get the BTC, you can go use the SEND function on coinbase, and then it will ask you for an address to send it to. Just type in your mycelium address and it will go.

Zebpay is a very known exchange in India. If you are within the US, and your region supports it, I would recommend Coinbase myself. That is what I have used from the beginning, so it is he only one I can speak of in terms of my experience. 
Exchanges in general are very restricted to operational regions, so you may find that while some work in certain countries, they cannot operate in others. I am actually working on compiling a list of trusted exchanges for every region the world, but it’s taking a bit of time.

$3k is not only too much in todays money, but it will be even more so in the future, don't trust anyone other than yourself. Here is what you do:
1.) Go to 
*Move your mouse around until it gets to 100%. Print out the page, and make sure you can see the private and public key.
2.) Send the coins to the public key, that way you are the only person who has access to them.
3.) Make sure to NEVER lose that private key. Those are YOUR BITCOINS right there. All you need to move/sell/trade the coins is the private key, so hold onto tight. Make extra copies and keep them in a SAFE place. If someone can find it, it is not safe. At the same time, keep in mind disasters, that can eliminate the paper.
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:39:42

1. At the time you click buy, the rate gets locked in.
2. Since coinbase is an exchange, you never know what will happen. Buy on coinbase and transfer to an offline private wallet.
3. You are corrent. Hit sell, and it'll go back to your banking account.
4. The words are for when you use an offline wallet. Your money is being held on the coinbase servers at the movement (Which you do not want). If you know your password, you are safe. UNless they get hacked, and you lose all your money. DO NOT keep your money on coinbase for longer than need.
Anymore questions, feel free to ask in the comment so I get a notification. Welcome to BTC! :)

Normally you keep he private key. With phone wallets you keep a 12 word password, which can restore your wallet in any device
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:17:43
No worries. I'll just give a run down since I don't know where you stand and you pick up what you need. A private key is a really long string of letters and numbers that represent a "wallet". They call it a wallet because that is where he bitcoin is stored. This means that if you have a private key, you own the bitcoin that that private key has. The first thing to understand is that bitcoin does not actually exist. The way it is stored is that everybody has a ledger and that lets you knows how much bitcoin each private key has. Now, my first question when I heard this was "what makes a bitcoin private keys safe?" Well it turns out that there are so many private keys that the chances that you guess the private key that somebody else is using is essentially zero. This means that if you have a private key you have the coins. So what a paper wallet is simply taking a piece of paper and writing down this really long string of letters and numbers. This means that when you go to send bitcoins you type in those numbers and letters and tell it how much to send. So to answer your question, to reset a paper wallet, you simply throw that one away(after sending the coins to a new one) and write down the private key of the new wallet( which now has the coins). Sorry if this was long. Ask away though if you have more questions, I am super new as well, and this helps me learn to explain, which I do to friends
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:19:29
The only option with 0 fee is buying from someone directly ( and even then only if they don't charge a fee, which they generally do). The only instant options on exchanges are indeed credit card and debit card, but since those can be charged back, you get the higher fee. While bank transfer takes longer, it cannot be charged back so you get a much lower fee. This, along with the fact that you will buy coins at the price of the time you bought them, makes it a superior choice imo. You won't get them for 3-5 days, but ask yourself if you will need them. Most of the time the answer is no, in which case you save on fees. If the answer is yes, then you will pay for that luxury accordingly with higher fees.

So how the brain wallet code works is that it uses takes the input that you enter (pass phrase), and does a mathematical equation to it, which turns into your private key. Now, the main thing to understand is that that "mathematical equation" was not made by bitadress, or even bitcoin. It is a known "mathematical equation" that has been used in computer science for years. In fact, you could look it up online and code it yourself in java,c Its so easy in fact, that there are websites that let you enter in your pass phrase, that will give you the same private key that you would get at bitadress. Bitadress simply puts it there for convenience and to help new members. Now that you understand this, if the URL was to seize, you would simply use another website to enter your pass phrase (or, in the worst case scenario (where every site that uses this code is offline), look up the code in a textbook) and get your key.
*I dont know what that "equation" name is off the top of my head, but I can find out for you if need be. Just know that it will be fine either way though! :)
**And like you mentioned, it is very unsafe using brain wallets for the most part. For those that dont know, there are programs that try million private keys a second, by using this "Math equation" to generate keys. A good rule of thumb is that if your pass phrase returns a google result, it is not safe(furthermore, googling it introduces the phrase to the web, which implements problems of its own)

The €2 was to buy from Coinbase, as in, they take that in order to provide the service to sell bitcoin. The .001 btc was the cost to send bitcoin over the network. This is taken by the bitcoin network itself. So it does not matter how much you send, it'll be .001 btc. This means you don't want to send many small amounts of btc, or else it gets expensive.

Ok here is what's goon on. Coinbase has a referral program. When you invite a friend, and they buy $100 worth, you both get $10. BY DEFAULT, Coinbase will refer yourself when you make an account. Since you were "referred" and spent $100, you got $10. It's essentially a little sign up bonus that you will get one time. The name they stated was just for fun, since they could have used any name.

Your mistake is in thinking that GOLD has an inhert value, it does not. It is worth what people think it is worth. If it becomes unusable the trust will be gone and it quickly isnt worth anything.
Further more, just like we mine(?) gold every year, we mine BTC every year. Funny enough, just as the amount of gold mined decreases slowly as there is less and less gold, so does BTC. BTC is quiet literally gold, in data form.

Yes the buying smaller amount is the key. Although I don't think that showing in bits is the way to do it. My parents and friends for example, don't really understand how you can buy .0005 btc. I think what needs to be more clear is the units of bitcoin(bits,Satoshi, etc) because even I hardly know them tbh. Everyone knows pennies dimes quarters nickels, yet we don't refer to things as pennies for price. You happen to know any good resources for units of bitcoin?

I like btc to be honest. You know how many coins you have, how much they are worth, math is easier. That many bits might just confuse people, and they might even buy less. The unit is btc, and talking about the fractions doesn't make much sense to me, yet anyways.

All keys in bitcoin is permanent. If you have a private key, you control the bitcoin. A public key is simply derived from a private key. Once you have a private key, you control all he coins that is assigned to that address on the block chain(i.e. The ledger). So to answer your question: yes, they are.

It's quiet a predicament many of us seem to be in. I would love the price to drop sub $1k so I could buy a few bitcoins, but every time the price drops, I cry a little. I want more coins before the price really takes off, and debating on buying now, or when(if?) it goes down...

Ok, ill just explain from the begging, and you jump in when you need to.
* In order to access bitcoin, all you need is the "Private key".
* A "Public Key" comes from the private key. This means that if you have a "Private Key", it is easy to get the "Public key". HOWEVER, if you have the "Public Key", it is not possible to get the "Private key"
* When you send bitcoin to someone, you send it to their "Public Key". Then it goes to their "Private Key". Again, all you need to SEND bitcoin the "Private Key". That's it. All you need to receive bitcoin is your "Public Key". This is the fundamental of bitcoin. You can give away your "Public Key" as much as you want, and people can send money to it. And the only way to spend the money on that "Public Key", is to know it's "Private Key", which as we just discussed, is not possible.
* So when we say Coinbase.com is an online wallet, that means that THEY CAN SEE your "Private key". Like we just covered, if you have the "Private Key", you can send bitcoin. This means that they are storing your "Private Key" on their server. That means if they get hacked by someone, that person can go and see your "Private Key", and use it to send ALL YOUR BITCOIN away.
* So how do you fix this? You use an OFFLINE wallet. This means that you make YOUR OWN "Private Key", and show it to no one ever. This also means that it is impossible to hack, because the only place that the key exists is offline.
* So now we are on the the topic of OFFLINE WALLETS. This can be broken up into a few categories. I will list them below:
1. Paper Wallet. A paper wallet is the safest OFFLINE wallet, but also the most inconvenient. The idea behind this is simple: You generate a "Private Key" AND a "Public Key" and write it down on a piece of paper. Then you send all your coins to the "Public Key". Since all you need to send bitcoins is the "Private Key" (Which you have written down) you can send anytime by pulling out the physical piece of paper, and sending out the bitcoin. This is inconvenient because every time you want to send your bitcoins to someone, you have to type in your "Private Key". This means that if you have a virus on your computer, they will see you typing your "Private Key" and have it. To fix this, every time you send money from a paper wallet, you have to make a new Paper Wallet safely, and send it to that one.
2. Hardware Wallet. Will Update in a second.
3. Software Wallet. Will Update in a second.
Just making sure you are good up until this point. Sorry for so much text. Let me know.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:26:57
Ya, with a trezor it will be very easy. We are in the same place, since I have a trezor and also plan on dumping bcc. Here is the thing though; it might take longer than we think. Estimates of hash power for new chain has blocks being mined every 3 hours initially. This along with everyone trying to move bcc, it will take a while, even with high fees. Then we have to see how kraken will handle the traffic. Let's hope it goes well man!

Odd that you didn't wait until the prices started to drop. Considering you can sell all at once at a locked rate upon hitting one button, you would think that you would wait until the drop started. I think it'll get to 2k before a drop, and which point weak hands will slip. Good for the rest of us to buy more sub 1500, of it ever reaches that low. Good luck though, you could have made he best decision out of all of us here.

The person that replied did not convey how unsafe they are, so here goes:
When they sell you the paper wallet with the coins on it, they are essentially selling you the code to access those bitcoins. It is obvious they still have the code(IE: THEY STILL HAVE the bitcoins), so you NEED to transfer the bitcoins to a new wallet (IE: A NEW PRIVATE KEY, that only YOU know). Until then, it is not even REMOTELY SAFE. Please do that as fast as possible, as in like, yesterday!

Cheapest and quickest tend to be opposites in bitcoin. 
If you want cheap, you buy on an exchange that doesn't charge a high rate (Gdax for example has like .25%).
If you want quickest, you can buy at a local ATM or from a person at localbitcoins. Depending on the ATM/Person, you may pay anywhere from 1-10%+ fees.
Hope that helps.

I personally use coinbase, and I like it alot. People here will tell it it has problems, but I have not experienced it. The only problem is, whichever exchange you choose, you most likely will need to provide ID in order to get USD.
So if not using an exchange,  is always an option, though not as safe.
If you are selling it fairly cheap, I would be willing to buy thorough paypal.

Hey been doing some reading and this might help you. Kraken is a trusted and big exchange. They will be crediting bcc for whatever amount btc you have with them.

Coinbase is good for buying it. They have your keys though, so this means you want to move the bitcoins after you buy it. So use coinbase to buy, then move to a paper wallet if you are keeping it (And dont plan on moving it).
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:47:52

Yes that works. But there will be a HUGE delay to send bcc across the block chain. Too many people moving it, with few miners. Blocks are going to take a few HOURS each. Fees will be crazy. I'm thinking of transferring btc now to kraken. They will split btc and bcc for us. Then just sell bcc for btc on kraken instantly ( not done on blockchain) and moving out all btc back to trezor. What do you do think of this? Kraken is a safe exchanges based on its history.
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:45:54

There is no such thing as "claiming an address" or "address existing".
All address are on the ledger, with MOST being 0 balance. 
When you generate a new address (Where it be by hand, online, using a program,etc), you are simply picking an address from the ENORMOUS list. 
So you have sent bitcoin to an address, and that address has that much bitcoin assigned to it. Someone might have the private key for it, someone might not (chances are they don't, like 99.99 repeating).
There's no way to get it back unless you have to private key to that public address.
Hope that helps :)

Not to sound rude, but you seem very sure about something you are wrong about. First, these are receiving addresses.

@_date: 2017-06-13 15:09:32
Well first thing to note is that the cost of electricity will increase notably for whoever is paying. Whether or not that effects you I'm not sure. Also, even if you are not paying, you would need something fairly powerful to make money. It's all about how much "hash" you can output. Hash is essentially how fast your machine can process tasks. You get paid according to how much hash you output. As a reference, my gtx 970 can output around 1,100. This running 24/7 will produce like $10 a month. The 970 is not the best, but it is noticeably loud and hot. I would do more research, but you will almost certainly come to the conclusion that you will make a tiny tiny tiny amount of money.

Nice thanks. So Gemini does not let you use CREDIT CARD right? Just ACH transfer, but you get funds right away to buy what you need. I suppose that will work. Really I want to use CC since I have no cash atm, but coinbase has like 500 weekly limit on credit card.

Cool story bro, tell it again

1. No. I know its hard to understand, but there are MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY keys. So many thats its hard to even comprehend. The chances that you will get a used 24 word seed, EVEN IF YOU CHECK MILLIONS PER SECOND, is like .00000000000000000000000000001% in your lifetime.
2. The passphrase does not increase secutity really. (It does, but thats not its purpose). Its purpose is to have many "Wallets" under one 24 word seed. You can also have cryptocurrency and not a single person can know. For example, if the gov made it illegal, and caught u with a wallet, you can give them your 24 word seed. Maybe in there you have $400. But they dont know u have a passphrase, which will access the adresses with $500000.

Download electrum and go from there. You don't have much time

Yes, but it depends on if it applies to you. Since all transactions can be seen for an address, they would see all you  history you used. If you buy buy stuff or sell stuff, or give or take money, it will all be public to see. If you get a new address each time, it is impossible for someone to know who that adreas belongs to and what they are doing
@_date: 2017-06-02 04:02:24
Every time you receive money to your address, trezor will generate a new one. The old one will be in a list called "used addresses". You can always see it, and always send funds to it

It'll take a few days to verify your account, but they have the lowest fees for credit card, and probably one of the safest exchanges. Do note that their customer service is horrendous recently with the influx of so many new traders. This is also a problem with most other exchanges however.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:44:17
Probably using local bitcoins and paypal, or coinbase. Coinbase has fees, and will take a few days to verify though, if you don't mind. They will take fee for sending and selling, and youll need to hook up account.
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:13:58
About 3-4 days at the moment. Just did mine.
@_date: 2017-06-01 03:13:36
Ya. This is the payout so far:

I agree thy should, but it would cost them more than they would profit. The general public doesn't know much about how to use bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:57:53
Both. As always, only invest what you can truly lose. You never know whats going to happen. Also, I would not buy RIGHT RIGHT now, its at 2400. It might dip a bit. Or do, idk :P
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:38:22
That's some it. There's familiarity, pre adoption, current price, future price speculation, and first move advantage. Many other factors, just listing some
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:48:51
Yup, would recommend. Banks transfers are instant and you can withdraw as soon as it clears.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:38:36
Not at all. Check out coinbase.com
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:36:51
You make more profit by buying BTC and holding it.

Lol so much FUD around here. Your gf is worth at least 3x what she is now. I say HODL until aug 1, and see what uasf does.

Ya, its super early still, so worst case scenario where it is a ponzi, I'll still make money. It opened like 1 month ago lol. So far, so good
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:24:03
What do you plan on doing with the coins after? Keep them or sell them for USD right away? This will determine what you need to do.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:15:38
Bitcoin costs 2700. It doesnt matter what you believe. This is fact, not an opinion.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:44:58
Good news for you! Gemini does in fact take 4-5 days to transfer from bank account, but they give you the funds immediately! You can then buy crypto as you see fit. You won't however, but able to withdraw them until it clears. So you can make quick buys if need be.
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:01:20
That's what Coinbase charges you. It is their fee to operate and has nothing to do with bitcoin miner fees. It won't go down 
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:46:17
Ok. So you in that car, you wouldn't be able to withdraw .005. How ever much bitcoin you buy, is how much bitcoin you will ever have. It's just that that amount is worth more. If you do want to buy, you should go to Coinbase.com. I use it, and it's really really easy
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:11:58
Well, it depends on why you are buying it. You should most definitely buy it with a bank and save money. Money is money. With that being said, if you need the coins NOW for whatever reason (trading, paying for something, gift, buying now to sell in a few hours if you believe the price will moon).

There are no passwords to addresses. If you have the address of X amount of bitcoins, you can spend and use X amount of bitcoin.

To the VERY VERY left, there is a huge hill you cant barely see. 1 week ago the price shot up to almost 3k. Then it shot down, which is the part you see.

Oh ya, this is just the beginning. I think 4k by end of year
