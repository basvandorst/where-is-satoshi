Thank you all knowing man for your astute price analysis based on a random thought backed by no evidence. Nothing tangible to drive up it's price? How about people buying bitcoin and holding it? Is that not tangible. BTC price isn't some magic monster in the sky that just goes up and down based off of people emotions. BTC had a run up before future trading was available and is now correcting itself (from people selling off), just as it has literally done on every other huge run up.

You're now arguing two separate things. I was referring to bitcoins price being based off of nothing tangible as OP originally said, which is clearly wrong. There are many tangible aspects that go into the valuation of a currency. In terms of intrinsic value, that a WHOLE other rabbit hole that has been discussed in depth time and time agin. My opinion is that the the the actual value (intrinsic or not), comes from the fact that it's the oldest, most secure blockchain that cannot be hacked. It's decentralized and unchangeable capped model makes it a perfect hedge to fiat that is being deprecated every single year due to centralized governments printing money out of thin air. Yes, there are other hedges like gold but Bitcoin has a huge upside compared to precious metals because of its current technology (IE: being able to send as much money as I want across borders in little time, with little fees, and no banks to deal with or question me), and presumably with it's future technology (lower transaction times, lower fees, etc.). That is why it's the perfect hedge against fiat and people of all different wealth groups will continue to move percentages of their portfolio into Bitcoin for many many years to come. I could care less about people buying into and not understanding but that's there fault for not doing their homework and understanding it's real use case and why its succeeding so much. Get it now?

stopped reading after your first point was the misspelling of words on a random internet forum. Great analysis.

Cool, literally no one cares if you cringe or not besides yourself.

You can always spot a person who is losing a debate when they break out the grammar argument. Thank you for that.
