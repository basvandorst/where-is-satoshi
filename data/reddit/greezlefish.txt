Much love brother.
Edit: you said dont worry about gold - but take it anyway. Thanks brother.

Ok great makes sense, thanks for the info. Does indeed at least look like I'm getting close. Frustrating 12 hours!

Thank you - absolutely right!

I think I see where you're coming from... is there a way to rectify the fee on the parent?
Also - how best to avoid this in future?

So if I'm reading the chart correctly there are c.600 transactions also unconfirmed at 350+?

I would say more economy focused. I am an economics undergrad so I have some prior knowledge in that area, however, being an international business MBA I was thinking something along the lines of how well bitcoin has been adapted to emerging asian markets, how it's helping businesses grow, creating shared value etc...

Thanks everyone for your responses. I'd love to add a tip to all respondents but I'm currently living below my means as an unemployed student. 
I'll remember it in the future when I'm hopefully much better endowed with BTC!

I quite like this idea! I had a quick look around and it looks like certain mobile companies allow for pre-paid topups with bitcoin and it seems like some businesses have adapted it as well... 
As far as organising an entire Bitcoin zone in a town, that may be a bit out of reach for me, although I'm not sure - I don't have a great deal of prior experience with bitcoin myself, how do you think something like that could feasibly be implemented? 
I'm going to be in Bangkok for most of my time in Thailand.

Thanks so much!

Thanks very much!

Ah ok maybe I'll edit that question for more clarification, what I meant by that was access to your wallet/payment system/information about current holdings/ability to buy/sell etc through mobile apps (or more recently as they come into play - bitcoin ATMs) and the like. 
Thanks for your responses!
