We know interest rates aren't going lower. Article says if rates hold, Bitcoin will trade on technicals. If rates rise (likely at some point) Bitcoin will take a hit.
What can happen to help bitcoin? A new round of QE?

I can see the accounting parts being an issue. I do business in India and accounting has caused headaches on multiple occasions in regards to payment via USD wire. Can only imagine with bitcoin. Hopefully bitcoin going mainstream will help the accounting side get cleared up and soon.

Bitcoin Investment Trust. In theory it is a way to buy into Bitcoin via shares. Each share is worth .1 bitcoin. I am sure it is arguable that this is not actually "owning" bitcoin as I don't believe you can request delivery on the contracts (like a futures contract of oil). So really it is a way for investors to expose themselves to the price action of bitcoin without actually having to purchase real bitcoins. 
Currently it sits at approx. $90 or $900 per one bitcoin. I assume the premium is there because the access, convenience, and ease of use of purchasing GBTC over BTC. 
I am just curious what others think on why that premium has decreased?
