 Too many folks imagining their dick in the gas tank of a car they'll never have. Can you really blame them?

In all seriousness, I do wonder about this part. 


For a project like Bitcoin, this is exactly what you would want to see. Widespread adoption and use. 
Additionally, for any other type of bubble widespread consumer adoption is usually the final stage. Smart money&gt;  institutional money &gt; public interest &gt; burst.
Ideally it's the former, but also could be the latter.
Certainly a burst doesn't erase any of bitcoins adoption, and makes it even more attractive for, you know, what it was designed to do — be a currency. 
Skeptical that "most" of Bitcoin Reddit is actually hodling long term, but it's nice to think that.
