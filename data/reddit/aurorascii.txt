Prbly by banning or otherwise preventing people from using crypto.
Can you imagine the audacity on these people (the bankers)?
It used to be that you got a smol amount of interest because you trust them to assume possession of your capital - and they can use it to laon it to others at a higher interest.
Now people are apparently so used to getting scammed by the financial system they are okay with paying the banks (with interest) to give them their capital so the banks can then give it for very cheap or for free to the wealthy.
I don't even.

Buy always for the same amount of your countries currency at the same time of your pay cycle.
And only use money you can afford to lose, don't go all in. Never put all eggs in one basket.
That way you won't get upset and panic sell when it dips.

Crypto adoption can not come soon enough.
These useless people at PayPal and the likes taking huge cuts for transferring imaginary money.
We can transfer actual money for lower fees using crypto already.

Stop posting the ride meme it only causes the price to go down.

Really? You can't be serious.
@_date: 2019-12-21 11:10:04
Do you really think posting these obvious attempts at making people buy BTC will make people feel less like BTC is just a ponzi scheme?
I would prefer if you'd advocate for the qualities of bitcoin to convince the public it is more than a high risk investment.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:14:55
That being said bitcoin has a big advantage of being the first and most well known coin, so it might be too big to fail.
I'd say Bitcoin will either go towards an absurdly high value in excess of 100K or to near 0.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:38:59
Blockchain and Crypto are like the Internet.
Bitcoin is now one project among many, and it remains to be seen if it turns out to be Amazon or Yahoo, Facebook or MySpace.

Sugar is indeed the culprit.
If you can completely or at least mostly cut or replace sugar you're good to go.
Vegans drink so much fresh juice and smoothies in their videos, I'm sure it's tasty, I used to love OJ.
But it's not good for you in terms of nutrients.
A fuck ton of sugar and acid and some vitamins isn't exactly ideal.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:12:43
Blockchain and Crypto together with AI/Neural Networks are the nxt big technological revolution, like the internet before it.
But will Bitcoin be the Amazon or the Yahoo?
I'm no expert in Blockchain technology but AFAIK bitcoin is quite far behind in terms of tech compared to ETH or Iota.
Sticking to an expensive compute intensive algorithm seems very inefficient to a layman like myself.
ETH is on a memory intensive algo which is more power efficient and iirc they plan on moving away from pow all together.

Judging from these numbers it is very possible that it dips further down to around 2k, no?

I said it in my own post that at least bch (r/btc) is just as guilty.
In case there was any doubt about my statement:
It seems that all crypto subreddits are pushing information to help their horse win, while supressing info that would lead to their horse losing.
Hence why I mentioned that Vitalik is hardly to be considered an unbiased opinion in this context.
Is it worse in other crypto subreddits? I don't know.
I don't follow them close enough to see which posts get removed.
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:30:10
Crypto is hard to read as a market because so many different people have their horses in this race and everyone wants theirs to win.
Apparently there is censorship on r/bitcoin, I've never seen any, but Vitali talked about it, so there may or may not be validity to that claim.
That being said he obviously has his own horse in the race, and if you follow r/btc is almost always some claims how they are the original, true bitcoin and the real bitcoin is just a shitcoin.
If the censorship in this subreddit is real, that shines a bad light on the project because ideas should be able to survive on their own merit in an open marketplace.
This is also true for Bch though and I fail to see what exactly Bch does that other cryptos can't do better.
Seems to me like they are just riding home that name brand and that's about all they have going for them, which seems like a really weak usp.

New Technology emerges that allows circumvention of previously established (finance) rules, fees and regulations, giving the people back control over their currency. 
"Let's regulate it. Regulate all the things and add some taxes and fees yay." 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:06:44
Crypto is amazingly entertaining.
The rush of the bull market. The FOMO you have to resist. The FUD.
The downplaying of losses in the bear market.
The coping mechanisms getting more and more desperate.
You can't appreciate that if you're not in it at all.
It's like collective gambling but better and you can share it with strangers over reddit.

Nah I just bought some.
Edit. Sorry about that btw.
@_date: 2018-12-17 15:59:42
No. Millions of people don't spend a second to think about how the internet affects their life's for better or worse.
They just use it because everyone does.

If I knew how low it will dip before the trend reversal I wouldn't tell you.
That being said I believe in the return to 1000 $.

When I sold 2/3 at the ATH I was worried about making a mistake.
FeelsGoodMan in retrospect though.
I bought some more at 5k but I'm still in the green.

I think you should all sell if you feel like it. :)

Every time a family member tells me bitcoin is a bubble I reply: "Ofcourse it is."
What I don't tell them is how tiny the global market cap still is compared to other markets and how much potential for growth there is left.
I've been doing very well with
 - buying when everyone is telling me to sell
 - selling when everyone wants to join in
 - not investing more than I feel comfortable with into something that I recognize as being a very volatile and risky asset.
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:59:04
There were times when fiat was so inflationary that nobody \*wanted\* to use it, so instead we went back to trading goods.
By your logic nobody should want to hold on to fiat / or even accept it all because they fear it losing value quickly.
In reality, inflation is noticeable but within reasonable levels most of the time, so that nobody is hesitant to accept, spend, and store fiat in a healthy economy.
Bitcoin supply is capped, but the rate at which miners are rewarded less and less coins per share is going down as we approach the supply cap:
As long as the rate of deflation is low enough, people should not feel disncentivised to use or spend it.
I think crypto in general has still a lot of room to grow and bitcoin in particular is so well known and so big that it probably won't vanish any time soon.
It may not be bitcoin that ultimately prevails though.

Title: Why Bitcoin will go a lot higher
Content: We are not yet at the bottom and it won't go to the moon.
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:10:20
He laid out very clearly how he thinks of bitcoin. As another currency to store value but also to use it.
Buy it when everybody is selling, and when it's higher than when you bought it, use it.
When it's going completely crazy, consider taking some out of bitcoin back into fiat.
That's what he said, that's how he's doing it.
That's the opposite of buying and hodl'ing, hoping it will go to the moon and you'll become a millionaire.
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:49:07
But it's not an investment from his pov.
It's a different currency.
Actual adoption vs speculative investment. 
Besides, I take it you will keep shorting forever, because you think it will drop to (close to) zero?

Which is surprising tbh.
Why jump through the hoops of tumbling your coins when you can just use monero for your illegal activities?
You could still transfer the money from xmr to XBT regularly if you think btc is more stable (it's evidently not).

And enjoying it. That would be me.
