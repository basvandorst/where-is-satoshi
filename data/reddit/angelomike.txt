Why are there new guys? 
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:06:24
I suppose your right, that's an optimistic way to look at it.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:25:37
Yep I was there too and im kicking myself for it. That's why I'm not gonna miss this for anything. I just don't know if this is the lowest as it ever going to be in the next few months, you never know I guess
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:50:08
I haven't heard of that. Thanks for the info
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:07:47
Didn't know that was possible. Silly me
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:19:27
What will be the cause so the rise. I don't understand, sorry
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:46:53
The thing is I. Not some kid that saw some people on the Internet  talking about how much you can make on bitcoin and thought "this is great, I'm jumping on the band wagon now"
I've been I interested in bitcoin from near the start, (for more ways than one, not financial gain) s few years later I planned to buy a load when they were $27 but thought they had gotten too high. Fast forward to today I'm sure you know the value buddy and realise that I would have made a substantial profit. I wouldn't call myself stupid (which is what i think your trying to say)for that experiment. Maybe we have a different definition of what's stupid but I would be pretty happy with the outcome

I've made my mind up and im buying for sure, it's actually gone up to over 900 since this thread haha :( I think it's been over 3 weeks since I sent my documents and im still not verified to buy goddamnit. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:07:07
OK ill just hold my money until the next one then
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:08:52
I WILL!
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:05:12
My phone decided to use that spelling.  I see it's still the number one joy of reddit to make fun on simple mistakes.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:16:51
lol that made me laugh because its very true. I'd say long term it will continue to rise, so as soon as you see it drop by a few hundred like it did last month then buy because soon we'll be looking back remembering when it was 800 like we did when it was 20
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:07:35
That makes a lot of sense, I should be grateful it's in the late 800s, i'm not going to wait around and make the same mistake twice so ill buy my friend. I guess I needed to hear it from someone else but it is the logical thing to do. Thanks
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:10:23
I'm with you on the long term use and not to use it to try to get rich. By make every e free do you mean to have control over your own money?
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:17:44
I have the same intentions as you do, I want to use bitcoin as a way of life and for its real purpose. But I've seen that you can make a lot of money from the rise of value so I'd be stupid not to aim to benefit myself in the process. Who doesn't need some  extra thousand in their wallet, especially in my position, that kind of money isn't easily gained
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:30:56
You got that right, big things are in the near future of bitcoin, i'm definitely in but it's just a matter of saving a few hundred when I buy, either way I'm sure I'll see a major profit even if I have to buy at 875 or higher
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:54:53
Haha those days sure are gone, it's hilarious looking back at me saying "$100 for a bitcoin, no way am I buying" but you know what, we still haven't missed it and will see the benefit when it reaches its potential. You sure are right about it being under exposed.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:06:16
I think people want to get out all together. The average person finds it hard to see the bigger picture
@_date: 2019-03-18 22:12:05
Wow how is this stuff still going on? What does this letter mean? They can't pay you?
@_date: 2019-03-18 22:59:06
So what happened?
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:00:19
I don't yet understand most of the things you referenced, and even though I'm not an expert I stand by my words of thinking about it technically. Like everyrhing there levels, not just retard and super wizard.
You've shown that you've invested a lot into block chain. But you don't say why banks will have a use for bitcoin and what it has over any other crypto currency.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:55:41
Haha! That made me laugh. She's actually very sexy so it wouldn't be a bad idea.
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:02:32
How does it work when you get paid though? Do you have to cash it out immediately? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:42:04
Thanks for the bracketed exploration.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:53:57
@_date: 2018-03-17 11:01:13
What do you guys think about the future of bitcoin? And what is fueling your optimism?
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:06:44
At home. Should have said.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:34:19
A 23 year old woman at work says she mines bitcoin. What kind of "set up" would you need? I'm interested to know if she's really got something good going on.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:13:36
What happened with gox? Did everyone get their money back?
When I think about what happened it's a scary thought.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:33:17
I definitely understand, and it is exciting. However thinking about it technically doesn't lead me to believe there's as much potential for growth as everyone thinks. 
The transactions aren't incredibly fast, and banks have no use for it. These may seem like insignificant points, but when moving forward in this world it's always convenience and being the most advanced that lead a technology to rising above everything else.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:21:43
I think you're right, was hoping it would dip quite a bit more though.
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:31:51
Well I'm greateful to have interacted with someone with far greater knowledge than myself. I don't mind being proven wrong because I'll come away better.
The points you've made kind of make sense and are the tip of the iceberg which I'll have to educated myself on to go further down.
Great contribution!
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:07:02
The question is, do you buy big now? Or is the real low still to come?
