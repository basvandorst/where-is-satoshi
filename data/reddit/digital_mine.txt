Omg untill the next dump?
Bear trap??
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:48:23
No not from airdrop I bought some of them to gamble on just-dice plus I liked the idea of POWS behind it
@_date: 2018-10-21 14:56:10
I found a nice ads service list here
Did someone have experience with some of them?
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:42:48
would be interested to get some more infos about this website
@_date: 2018-07-08 21:58:42
where exactly?
I'm in the country at the moment maybe I can stop by if close enough
@_date: 2018-07-14 13:13:13


When it is supposed to happen?
Other sources where we can get  more detailed infos?
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:21:44
So far the prediction is wrong, and I'm glad about it!!  
it was  supposed to rise in the range of 0.2/0.3% but we are already 9.701%  and volumes UP! DO NOT SELL YOUR CORN  FOR CHEAP FOLKS keep fuel the  pump!
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:19:22
Hope for the second option sir.
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:00:15
Well both argoments are valid!
The fact that BTC should be decentralized, and the fact that if we want to grow for real we need the average Joe s to get in and ETF could help
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:53:46
fiat the Italian car manufacturer ;)
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:36:39
Sounds logic
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:00:10
FAKE NEWS
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:02:34
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:26:00

@_date: 2018-07-11 23:10:22
could you please elaborate
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:12:07
I'm testing my program that what I'm saying, while I'm sharing its output
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:36:46
51000 trades done since my last  price prediction 99000 trades to go!  
So far the last prediction is more precise than the previous one ;)
@_date: 2018-07-22 22:57:54
Keep dumping? LOL
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:52:34
100 000 trades on kraken is the interval 
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:11:10
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:19:58
For example?
@_date: 2018-07-28 23:17:41
AMEN bro!
these are the real pros of BTC, EVERYONE can take part, from the poorest human being to the richest central bank!
it is here for the whole humanity

@_date: 2018-07-12 21:41:01
The problem for me will be whether this all ETF thig will leat to a major dump/price manipulation as it is happening with the futures
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:51:27

@_date: 2018-07-22 21:43:34
For now I just wish to let it work and get a nice accuracy rate. Share here and on Twitter the results, and hopefully get some tip for improve it.
On github I published the code of the data extractor already, about the predictor we will see
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:05:47
No 
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:36:20
Thx I know what legal tender is, but I miss the news if it exist, and actually is a big one. Do u have a link of the source?
@_date: 2018-07-18 22:49:33
No I don't, but would be fun to get them pump the price a bit
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:36:03
