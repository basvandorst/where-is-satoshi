25 million and we don't even get to know what it is! Honestly, something like this can't make any sense... or am I missing something? If this isn't something similar to bitcoin, then it must involve all the good old archaic SWIFT/Plastic backends of our modern financial system. So if it does, how is it any better than just having cash or credit cards? Perhaps it uses near-field communication to interact with hardware already at the merchant's checkout? But if so, why is that novel or new? I really don't see the value proposition here whatsoever. 
Clearly, this company is going to make a profit somehow, which means their fees will probably be layered on already existing fees. So how does this make any sense? More expensive (probably for the merchant!) and for what? Just so we don't have to reach out and pull out a credit card? 
What's the convenience here for the consumer? To be able to lose their entire financial keychain every time they lose their phone? I have lost my phone numerous times over the past decade, but have lost my wallet only once in my entire life time (knock on wood).
The fact that Clinkle team members' BIO excerpts read like the headstone of Dr. Seuss on acid (can we all just say what we mean for once? I mean really.. their bios are FRUITY) gives me little hope. Unless this is somehow an alternative payment system which eclipses anything we've seen before, it really sounds like another overhyped (so good we won't even tell you what it does!) gamble placed by a bunch of rich people on some untested cabrones from their Alma Mater.
