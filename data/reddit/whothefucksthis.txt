Now that Wall St is involved Bitcoin will be pumped and dumped relentlessly because of the unregulated trading environment. No way it will make gains that size without being dumped before the end of the tax year.

The true value of Bitcoin isn't unique though. Certainly not $8000 per coin unique. There's no value behind the coin to justify that price. It's unregulated market speculation. If banks truly felt threatened by Bitcoin they would simply change the way they operate to compete with it or pump and dump it into oblivion. Inflation isn't an argument against fiat in stable economies as the effect on consumer purchasing is almost always fractional. Bitcoin doesn't have much inherent value beyond speculating and as soon as the mining process is over another coin will take it's place and speculators will move to that. Bitcoin will then plummet again. Unregulated currencies just can not survive long term.

Some of these posts are borderline fanatical. Sell bitcoin if you need the money and buy it if you can afford to speculate. Everything else is hysteria.

Bitcoin could be replaced with a better system and everyone holding it would be left with something with little inherent value and certainly nothing like the value it currently fluctuates around.

Wow. You are absolutely clueless. Please do not give anybody investment advice. You seem totally unhinged and brainwashed.

When you speculate on something that loses value it is a loss.
