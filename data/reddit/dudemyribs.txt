Excellent analysis. Thank you.

Ok, I think I'm getting it. And the individuals are anyone with a wallet? or full nodes?

Interesting. Then why has much of the talk about increasing the blocksize centered around the large mining pools acceptance of this?

The devaluation of a currency does not destroy that currency in every case. That type of manipulation is usually tied to a nation attempting to decrease the price of its export goods. The dynamics at play with the value of bitcoin are different. The question is what are those dynamics and why do they encourage/discourage the change of the protocol?

Perfect. That's a great summation. Thanks for helping me hash this out.

So, in some sense it's a double form of validation by the miners and the bitcoin users. There is incentive for miners to use the protocol that is accepted by users so that their block is accepted and the bitcoins they earn from the mining have value.

But is it current bitcoin users that have control of that? I was recently asked this question by a relative who has been interested in bitcoin and just learned that it will be capped at 21 million: "How is that established and who controls it?" This post is aimed at answering that question.

So, the discussion of mining pools accepting one form or another is simply for endorsement not toward the technical requirement for altering the protocol?

How did you use Segwit?

ok, fair play
