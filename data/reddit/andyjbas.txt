I had the same experience. They had a bug in their interface which resulted in it being impossible for me to complete verification on my own. I had to submit some of it via email to support (sketchy in any case) and then they did not even email back once the information was accepted and processed, despite two check-ins from my end.
I understand KYC/AML and all that, but there is no excuse for technically broken user experiences at this stage in the game.

Same, purchased at 19:08 PDT and still pending.
Edit: Just went through around 1 hr after initial purchase.

Over the course of about 4 weeks, I only managed to receive 2 replies from support regarding issues that prevented me from using my account in any capacity, and all this after 2 years of consistent use. I was very polite in my questions and responses. I ended up closing my account.

It probably isn't the case with OP, but in many countries Uber allows passengers to pay in cash as many people don't have credit cards. The driver still has to pay fees to Uber later on, but I suspect there is nothing wrong with accepting bitcoin for a few rides and still paying the Uber fees with cash or credit card profits from other rides.

Safety/security/convenience. Inputting an address for the driver is a huge convenience for everyone, and also having everything tracked in case something goes wrong.
