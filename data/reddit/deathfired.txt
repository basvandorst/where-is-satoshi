I remember when they first opened. So many loans to choose from but the chance of anyone ever paying back in full was rare. It did get better over time but it the end I lost more money than I was making so I stopped using the site. Seeing all this drama and lack of professionalism isn't encouraging me to go back.

I see what you did there. Nice ad for coinfeed lol.

The photo OP posted it from the guy who did the Hold 31 Cryptocurrencies for 365 Days experiment. Here's what he said on his blog. "Buy $10 USD of the top 30 cryptocurrencies by trading volume on HitBTC (where I purchased all of this)."

I believe the problem isn't so much about people having to pay taxes on it, it's more so that the taxes are the same or higher than what it would cost to just use a credit card or cash to buy something. This ultimately makes it pointless to get into bitcoin as a new person. The people "ok" with this are people investing in bitcoin for the long term. The people not ok with this are the ones actually using bitcoin on a daily basis to purchase things. It makes no sense to buy anything with bitcoin now and company's are going to avoid accepting it because of this. Too much paperwork and tracking. It's essentially been turned into gold now.

I'd also assume that if you are using an American exchange, the IRS would know exactly how much you're making a year. American exchanges have to do book keeping on all transactions now and require proof of who you are in order to trade. There's a chance that they may also be required to file with the IRS and start mailing out 1099 forms to their users at the end of each year.

Thanks! I have some buddies who I talk with about bitcoin. I'll pass this information on to them as well.

I've been on the site pretty much all day using Chrome and Firefox. Had no security issues and the site loaded fine. My bots have been running 24/7 and they don't seem to have any connection errors in their log files either.

Wait, my own backyard has a bitcoin meetup?! When do you guys meet and where at?

I agree with  I travel regularly to and from Manchester Airport and I have a bitcoin iron on patch on my travel bag. I've never once been stopped by TSA because of it in the two years that I've had it. It really does sound like the typical issue of TSA finding something questionable that's completely unrelated to what the person thinks they're being questioned about. But then again maybe they are on the look out for physical bitcoins with tied value of up to 10,000 to them. In any case the author brought attention to himself with all the pins in his bag. TSA would have pulled him aside anyway even if he wasn't into bitcoin. It happens.

That's why it's better not to time to market. Instead buy regularly regardless of where the market is heading and you have nothing to worry about. Same with stocks. It's dumb to try and time the market.

I remember a few years back when this guy had several channels about martial arts, meditation, and fung shway haha. Looks like he's moved on to bitcoin now.

That is a stock, not a bond. While I did say bond and stock in my first post I actually meant Bond and Loan. My bad. Look up BTC-Bond or CIPHERMINE.B1 or any of the other Bond/Loans listed on btct. Their dividends are low but the value of the bond almost NEVER changes so buying a bunch and then sitting on them for a month+ is profitable. You can sell them at any time so there's little to no risk involved. It's a long term investment though.
I've been doing this for several months before I started mining and there really hasn't been any downside to it. Stocks on the other hand ARE a gamble. Avoid them unless you know what your doing.

BTC is an experimental currency that's highly volatile. What's your point? I'm just speaking from my own experience using USB miners. I'm reaching my breaking even point faster than I would have if I had just sat on the BTC that I was generating.

hmmm It'd be awesome if catering companies all came together to maintain a central map of the conventions they where catering and whether or not that convention had food that they're looking to give out. That way homeless in the area or poor college kids looking for free lunch could just find a local convention that was ending and head on over before the caterers absolutely had to dump the food.

I'm actually leaning more towards a join experiment by multiple organizations from multiple countries. I'm no conspiracy theorist but it's common knowledge that many different countries have been trying to create a stable market. Unfortunately most countries are attempting it by relying on the US market. I feel like Bitcoin was an experiment brought on by multiple countries as a way to see if the "gold standard" is truly the way to go or not. Key word here is experiment. It'll be interesting to see what comes about from this in the next year or two. I'd not only be watching what countries do and how they react about bitcoin but also what they do about Gold and Silver.

Just out of curiosity did you watch his interview that was posted on here a few days ago? He clearly does know how bitcoin works and people are blowing his comments way out of proportion simply because he said the CFTC are looking into it. He even mentioned that because bitcoin isn't controlled by any one entity there's not really a way to regulate it without offering it in our own exchanges...which wont happen. They're only looking into how they can protect users from losing all their money from Bitcoin being so volatile. So basically they're just blowing US tax payer money.

If you want to just get your feet wet then pick up a few USB Block erupter mining sticks from ebay for $20. They dish out about 335-337MHs and you should make about .0045-0075 a day with 5 of them running together (That's about what I make).
If you want to actually break even and make money your better off dishing out a lot of money on the higher end mining rigs. Here's a list  . To be honest though, mining really isn't worth it anymore. Better mining rigs keep coming out which causes the network hashrate to increase dramatically which also causes the difficulty to raise dramatically which also makes it increasingly difficult to brake even.

1)Install noscript
2) inspect with firebug/inspector and display:none; on the iframe.
I can already see people making userscripts that make this process even easier for the people that have no idea how to get around this.
You really need to make this server side or come up with a way of detecting when people tamper with the iframe.

I got 5 at $67 each a little more than a month ago. I've been mining for a month and have made just under $53 at current rate. Mining alone is pointless now with these things unless you have a crap load of them. Invest all or the majority of your earnings into bitcoin bonds and stocks to gain dividends.

I'm curious about this subject. After reading finCEN's updated doc it sounds like pretty much any site that allows users to trade virtual currency for virtual currency or virtual currency for USD has to pay up. Users who buy or give bitcoin to other users are free to do so. Any lawyers in mind verifying this? 
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:05:21
It's actually pretty clear when you read it off their site 
So yes, WoW gold would fall under this but it would probably only apply to players who setup sites or ebay shops selling WoW gold. Blizzard itself would avoid this since players can't convert WoW gold back to USD via their site or in game. Would the government go after players selling WoW gold? Probably not since this is mainly aimed at bitcoin and other emerging virtual currencies that are being adopted by legitimate companies world wide.
Also this particular line should irritate a lot of people.
"The definition of a money transmitter does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies. Accepting and transmitting anything of value that substitutes for currency makes a person a money transmitter under the regulations implementing the BSA."

Look up bitcoin bonds. They are wonderful things :).

That's "user". Users are fine regardless of what they do. I'm talking sites.
