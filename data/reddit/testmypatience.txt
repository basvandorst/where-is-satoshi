Same here. Bought $100 in at $10. Good investment. Sell a couple, keep the rest and hope to see it go to the moon like bitcoin. Maybe I'll be able to spurge on something cool in a couple years.

But when to buy back in is the question. Is there any platform that allows your account to buy and sell at specific points?

I know someone in USA with a job that couldn't open a bank account because there was some kind of debt associated with their SSN. Was a bit surprised. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:44:09
I figure you could safely estimate a buy threshold during a fall. The high point that you came from, the previous big valley, and that difference cut in half should be a good distance from the peak you just came from in which to buy more again. At least to your previous coin amount you had at that previous peak.
I'm disappointed that software hasn't completely gamed the trading market with 100% accuracy.

I read the main post as that you are basically doing the equivalent of walking down a street flipping door handles on cars to see which ones are open which leads to opening them and taking what is is inside.
I'm not super into bitcoins but have a part of one. So only somewhat familiar but trying to familiarize better but likely not to a degree that would make this main post make much more sense.
@_date: 2017-01-01 08:20:57
Nope. That was not the point.

Cripling the country you live in by using a really jacked up stealing scheme is stupid regardless if you didn't get punished and kept the money you stole. Just because you got what you wanted doesn't make it any less stupid. Stupid is pretty damned objective.
Done being punked though, so... bye.
@_date: 2017-01-10 08:16:26
Just because you get away with something doesn't make your actions less stupid.
I feel like I'm being punked right now...

People that are being stupid don't tend to think they are being stupid even though they are being stupid. So...
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:21:50
That's how it should be. Banks and companies do stupid things all the time.
@_date: 2017-01-01 08:26:16
So it has nothing to do with coming up with something.
@_date: 2016-11-12 00:05:02
Finding a equal opportunity, not outcome, is the goal. This makes it so that no matter your wealth, you have the same opportunity, not outcome. This means that some kind of diminished returns needs to happen the more ability you have. Perhaps the process takes into account the amount of processing power per your bitcoin account so that the diminishing returns can be enforced and ability for regular folks without a datacenter with high priced rigs can have a reasonable chance.
I'm not about theft and enforcing the equality of outcome that way, I am interested in the equality of opportunity. If you aren't a rich person, you are sort of limited to your ability to get a rig that will get you anywhere at all.
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:06:06
That is irrational.
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:12:01
You've still not at all changed your argument and therefor the conclusion remains the same.
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:10:16
I see, and how does that make you feel?
@_date: 2016-12-31 03:44:18
I said it was irrational. That only is regarding rationality, not legality or compliance. All three are different things.

Anonymous currency that is also electronic isn't exactly a complicated concept to come up with. 
The TOR network, also not a complicated concept to come up with.
Many things that are awesome are not complicated or difficult to come up with. An idea however is not execution of it.

Did I stutter? 
See "If nothing has been done to the object then the selling price should not be a factor that induces taxing."


Once again, did I stutter? Pure analogy is money and I made two specific examples about it changing value. The dollar, the cent, etc. are all tied originally to the gold standard but now are tied to theoretical constructs, but that does not change that the currency is assigned to things that change value and therefor also change value. Money is a precise analogy to stock. 
See "When rich people had their riches and the value of money increased because people had less of it during the great depression, rich people were not taxed on the difference in value. Just because inflation happens doesn't mean the government is going to give you money to make up for the value lost in the money you have sitting in the bank or in a jar in your house."




You did not achieve this goal.

Just because something is a "law" doesn't make it rational. Many things have been legal that were irrational. Slavery, prohibition, and more were irrational, yet legal.
Legal does not equate rational/reasonable, and illegal does not equate irrational/unreasonable.

Merit is what I care about and so far it seems that people upvote those posts so that means they care about those posts the same or more than the others new posts. That or you don't understand what voting is intended to show.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:02:21
Is it really not a wallet in a real way because they can jack with the coins if there is some kind of fork or whatever is happening? I just want to protect myself from losing my coins/value if there is a fork or whatever is happening. It's a bit unsettling for someone that entrenched in cryptocurrencies news and tech.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:34:25
Oh wow. That makes this a lot clearer. Is there by a chance a YouTube series for a beginners guide for all this stuff that a beginner needs to know and how to work it all out? It seems like a massive amount of information to know. Not very simple :/

No, no we don't all have price ticker apps on our phones. Some people only give enough of a crap to check the sub-reddit to see what is going on.
Plus each time you get a price ticker post you get conversation around it.

That one looks promising. I just wish that I was able to go to a site and put in my paypal info and boom have some bitcoins. Linking it to my bank is frustrating.
Hey, would it be feasible to "sell" bitcoins on amazon? Amazon pretty much can take payments from anywhere.
