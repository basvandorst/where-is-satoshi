It would seem like it.  BFX should be doing everything they can to claim compensation from BitGo and yet they are doing the opposite.

@_date: 2016-08-18 16:06:20
It's suspicious.  It's possible he was hacked.  And as to why the hacker would post a message like that? My theory is to create fear, lower the price, profit from short selling.
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:35:45
I'm surprised it has not yet been 100% drained.  Are people seriously still trusting them with their money?? I see about 3k in asks sitting there, so that's not getting withdrawn (for now).  Insane.

@_date: 2016-08-04 13:13:59
The answer may be simpler than you think.  BitGo has funding from US VCs and could actually afford to compensate the victims (at the VCs expense).  But they would rather claim BFX is some shady HK exchange and is 100% responsible.  
So BFX is being forced to commit seppuku to protect BitGo.  Don't worry though, the executives will get cushy jobs at VCs' other companies.
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:29:06
Their heart is in the right place, but this is not the right price point for a home miner.  Most people who want to home mine are doing it for fun so a price around $300-400 would work best.  Also nobody wants to run a home miner that eats as much energy and sounds like an AC.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:13:31

I get the anonymity thing, I really do.  But he should make his GPG public key known and sign all posts with it so we know it's really him and his Github was not hacked.

Lol nobody is seriously considering that.  
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:42:15
Why would they be so quick to claim BitGo is not at fault?  At minimum, they could have waited untill the investigation is complete.  Now their own statements can be used against them in court.
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:42:54
Its possible they would give dollar and altcoin equivalents.  But this seems overly complex and people who are not into alts would likely trade it for BTC anyway once given the opportunity.

Obviously he is not going to give them away (or will send it to one of his own accounts to make it look like he did)
But is he the actual hacker or a whale just having some fun?

The code is open source.  If you don't trust what these developers are doing, go and review it.  Or you can even run a different node - nobody forces you to run Core.
@_date: 2016-08-25 14:47:41
This is always a bit frustrating, but not updating on day 1 is a good practice anyway in case there are bugs.  Especially for important nodes.

That line of thinking is a trap.  You're basically agreeing if terrorists do use technology X, it should be banned.  So how will you defend Bitcoin if/when it happens?

2mb would be fine.  BUT the problem is big block proponents will then push for ever bigger increases as transaction volume starts to approach the new ceiling.  
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:47:48
Good analogy.  They keep raising it every year and the whole thing is a sham.  Effectively, the ceiling does not exist because it can be raised so easily.

This is the free market at work.  Electricity is cheaper in China so that's where mining will happen.  Nothing you can do about it, unless you find a place with cheaper electricity.  It's like complaining that 90% of oil comes from the Middle East.

That is the mark of a master troll, and he is one of the best I've seen.  A master troll makes himself a part of the community and even pretends to support its goals and ideology (on the surface).  He will attend conferences and give interviews.  Once he built a reputation, he will however slowly start creating FUD via concern trolling.  Not sure who pays him for this, but here is what we know about R3:

It is not clear that larger blocks will result in more total fees, however.  People will pay the absolute minimum if blocks are not full and there is no risk of their transaction being excluded.  Miners know this.

It has been figured out:

The number of nodes can be easily faked by running pseudonodes on cheap AWS instances.  This tactic has been used by XT promoters.
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:26:34
Sure, you can follow the history of an address and infer some things about how it's used (so yes, pseudonymous would be more correct).  But it is very difficult to prove a particular address belongs to a given person, assuming they do not reveal their identity when acquiring or spending from that address.
@_date: 2015-12-23 05:29:54

We will find out (my guess is no, not many of them at least).  In Gavin's proposal 80% of miners must switch for the fork to happen.  I believe the difficulty cannot adjust more than 20% down each period.

@_date: 2015-06-06 16:50:24


Impossible.  Bitcoin addresses contain a checksum so the the chances of accidentally typing another valid one are 1 in a billion.  Nobody types addresses anyway, they scan QR codes or copy paste.
And a web wallet would refund your BTC if you sent it to the "wrong" address or was stollen by malware?  That would just open the door to all kinds of fraud.

If running a full node is getting cheaper, why do we see their numbers drop?  The fact is, people running full nodes are volunteers and there are other costs involved (e.g. Bandwidth).  Doing things that will decrease the incetive to run full nodes will eventually kill bitcoin by ensuring that a copy of the blockchain is only provided by large entities.

Chinese miners have been put on notice!  If we move to a different hashing also, they will lose millions in ASIC investments.  This is a very real threat to them - let's watch them spread FUD to try and avoid it.  Watch them post with dopey throwaway accounts like TulipsNHoes.
The Bitcoin users have always been in control, the miners work for us.
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:41:27
Because Bitcoin is not broken; a hard fork is very risky.  Doing nothining means keeping the system working as it has before (and it has been working perfectly)
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:52:17
As a miner, it would make sense for me to process any transaction where the fee is greater than 0.  So everyone will pay the smallest fee they can get away with.  The security of the bitcoin network will rest on the HOPE that we get enough usage by March 1st to pay the miners.  Scary.

@_date: 2017-02-11 13:24:33
If they did not want people to use it, they would have just closed the exchanges long ago.  Having random PBoC announcements every week or so allows the officials to buy low and then sell high once the price recovers.  Rinse and repeat.

The gauntlet has been thrown down.  One of the largest Bitcoin holders will attack the hard fork if it develops by actively dumping coins on exchanges that accept the new chain and acquiring coins on the original chain with the proceeds.  This will destroy the price on the new chain exchanges.

No, if 80% of hashpower moves, it would make confirmations 5x slower until several difficulty adjustments.  That would be a disaster for anyone using that fork.  Several wealthy early adopters of BTC have stepped forward to ensure they lower the price of the new coin to make it less profitable for miners and ensure they stay with the original chain.

I run several full nodes and will not be upgrading them to 0.11.  Sorry.
@_date: 2016-03-03 14:35:48
Can you explain why my example does not hold?  If two equal miners are competing, 1/2 of the total hashing work is "wasted" as blocks are randomly "stolen" from each other due to luck.  With 3 competing miners it's 2/3 waste, with 100 it's 99/100 waste.  
This would be different if they were cooperating.  If 99 drop out, the lone 1 miner would be in for a hard time as the difficulty was adjusted to accommodate 100 miners.
So Bitcoin does not care about the "wasted" work, only actual work submitted.  I say "wasted" because that is the price of decentralization and even by cooperating miners would gain only a temporary benefit as the network difficulty would readjust upwards eventually.  
So in case of a reward drop the only negative side affect would be less decentralization.  Block time and difficulty would stay constant.  
Where is the error in the above logic?  Appreciate the discussion, btw.

For simplicity, let's assume we only have 2 miners, A and B, each with equal hash power.  They are competing with each other and each collects half of the rewards.  If A were to drop out after the halving, B would start getting 100% of the reward.  So for B the revenue would stay exactly the same: they are getting half the coins but nobody is competing with them so they win all the blocks.
This is even less of an issue with the current situation as there are many competing pools of miners.

For long-term investors, one of the biggest concerns is what happens when block rewards get closer to zero.  Will there be constant 51% attacks? Will there be no choice but to make Bitcoin inflationary?

If a HF occurs, most people will not move their coins at all as it would be extremely risky.  It will probably be some time before the dust settles and the longest chain is decided.  Remember, ETC came out of nowhere to cause headaches for ETH.

It's not specific users being kicked out, but use cases.  For example, micropayments have been priced out years ago.  Now we are purging coffee transactions.

It's not suprising that the first transaction did not get processed amid the spam attack as it had 0/low fees.  What is disturbing is that it reappeared later and got processed with 0 fees.  This makes no sense, as there as still plenty high fee transactions for miners to include from the mempool.
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:40:19
The problem is that's not what people are complaining about.  If they were saying "my wallet asked me to pay $0.10 for a transaction and I could not afford it" it would be a different story.  We would be talking about how to help them get out of poverty, find a descent job, etc.

Nobody wants to buy a top of the line PC and keep it on 24/7 to run a node.
We need Bitcoin to run on RPI-quality hardware or a VPS.  This is why a block increase is so destructive.  We can barely handle 1MB today.  Anything much bigger would lead to total centralization where only Coinbase and other large businesses can afford full nodes.

The fact is that Bitcoin cannot scale to be used as e-cash by any significant portion of the world's population.

This is one thing people don't realize.  While fees are not based on the transaction amount, people would be willing to pay higher fees for larger transactions (e.g. $5 for $500).  If I had to transfer $1,000,000 worth, even a $100 fee would seem reasonable.  So eventually the blockchain will have only large, high-quality transactions and coffee purchases would be the new "spam".
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:07:55
Given how revolutionary Bitcoin is, we need to be bery, very tough on people attempting to attack it.  And if you think the attack will be direct and obvious, you are dead wrong.  A much more successful attack involves splintering the community either by getting people to diversify into altcoins or splitting bitcoin itself.  
In my opinion, the best way to deal with BU is to completely ignore it.  Let them scream loudly about whatever latest Blockstream conspiracy they make up.  More and more they will seem like a crazy hobo on the street screaming about something incomprehensible.

This is quite a bizzare view considering Bitcoin is up 300% YoY.  But let's think about the ETF decision.  Here the government had a choice to a) instantly make millionaires of hackers, ransomware extortionists, anarchists, libertarians, and other deplorables OR b) deprive baby boomers of buying a BTC ETF in their IRAs.  
There were many promising signs leading up to the date, but clearly it was all just dragged out to cause maximum damage when the denial is issued.  But the reaction has been muted so far.  Are you claiming someone is artificially propping up prices even today?  To what end?  My take is that the rejection was already priced in, and an unexpected approval could have sent it above $2,000.
Nobody can predict the market.  People said the stock market would collapse if Trump got elected.  The opposite has happened.
Any comparisons of Bitcoin to similar assets (e.g. Gold) make it obvious that it is severely underpriced, even at these lofty levels.  So a few years from now this discussion may look increasingly silly, like people arguing in 2012 whether BTC should be worth $12.50 or under $10.
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:13:31

I see what you're saying.  I think my error was assuming all competing miners are checking the same set of hashes and duplicating work, which obviously they are not.
Still, we have not seen the "death spiral" happen in the wild, we had many examples of halvings that had no impact on hash rate.  Litecoin most recently, and Bitcoin itself in 2012.  So there might be more factors at play here.
@_date: 2017-03-01 23:35:23

As a holder you face different risks. For instance, even a 51% attack on current blocks is not very threatening to a long-term holder whose coins are buried under a mountain of work.  Meanwhile, it is very damaging to spenders and any short-term holders.  So in the future I see much higher fees and/or waiting longer for more confirmations on transactions to reduce the risk of a 51% attack.  
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:15:33
Oh look, more pointless threats from Jihan! We all know you will not actually fork.  How does it feel to be Roger Ver's lap dog?

No, it's like them leaving to start mining for an alt coin.  With those miners gone, the SegWit signaling % will shoot up amd might actually activate on the BTC chain.

I'm no apologist for exchanges and I fully agree the operators are incompetent at best and scammers at worst.  It's the other statements I have a problem with: 


No it's not failing.  It can continue growing organically as it has since day 1.  The ETF would have been a nice bonus but Bitcoin will continue growing just fine without it.


This again.  Nobody knows who actually owns BTC and how much they own.  Or if they lost their keys.  Or if they intend to ever sell.  And this has nothing to do with the economy.  The only thing that will increase the price is more people deciding to hold/buy.  One big holder could be preferable to a thousand small ones who will follow the herd and sell on any remotely negative news.

If you dig into it, in all cases these people were tracked down by doing something outside the blockchain (e.g. moving their coins to an exchange to buy/sell).  Satoshi has been able to stay anonymous precisely because he has avoided doing this.

Let's see how well all these ASICs will hash SHA3.  Miners are really walking on thin ice here.  Any attack on Bitcoin will result in an immediate PoW change.  It's the easiest thing in the world and will decentralize mining again.  
In fact, we should do it regardless.  SHA2 is beggining to show its age and the current batch of miners needs some punishment for their actions.

@_date: 2017-03-20 15:51:55
Right now there is minimal risk to miners.  If the market rejects the BU fork, they can just go back to mining BTC as before.  But if BTC switches the PoW, they are out of luck.

Also a major reorg like that would definitely encourage devs to update to a new PoW.

The problem for users who don't upgrade is they will accept now-invalid blocks from non-conforming miners.  This can potentially (although unlikely) lead to double-spending attacks.  Therefore, ideally, users should upgrade as well.

The assumption is that there is viable competition from altcoins but we have simply not seen that despite continuous complaints about Bitcoin.  There were a few that spiked briefly but then slowly withered away.   We need a period with full blocks to see whether investors actually start to abandon Bitcoin or simply adjust their usage patterns to conserve transaction space.  I suspect it will be the latter.

It might have a short term impact, like bad news for one company drags town stocks in the whole industry.

I have huge respect for Balaji, but he is wrong here.  This is a zero sum game and what's at stake is nothing less than the financial future of the world.  Money invested in altcoins is money that has not been invested in Bitcoin.  So while I think Bitcoin will still win in the end, altcoins slow it down.

This presents quite a dilemma for Classic miners now that they can no longer obstruct progress with less than 5% of hash power.

It will reach an equilibrium where the market will decide whether the fee is too high to transact.  For example, paying a fee of $0.20 for a $1 cup of coffee will be too much for some people.  However, paying a $10 fee for a $500k house purchase seems perfectly reasonable.  So eventually the less important transactions (eg coffee) will be done off-chain as they are replaced by larger, more important transactions which are done on-chain.
@_date: 2016-06-08 14:07:15

If China REALLY wanted to ban Bitcoin, they could do so very easily just by shutting down the main exchanges.  Since they have not done so, the only explanation is that officials in charge have been compromised and invested in Bitcoin themselves.  Instead we get these vague warnings which only serve to collapse the price and allow the corrupt officials to get in at a lower price point.  More in depth explanation of this theory:

The system is so insecure it's hard to believe.  If you know someone's account number (e.g. from a check they have you) you can make ACH credit card payments from it.  Routing numbers are public.  They should at least implement verification like they have for bank to bank transfers.  
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:59:12
Essentially all money is digital right now anyway.  The difference is with fiat you have governments and companies keeping track of the ledger (centralization).

@_date: 2016-06-09 21:22:16
True but those banking transactions can be traced and potentially reversed.  The reason criminals prefer crypto is because it is harder to trace (esp if they don't covert the BTC to fiat) and the transaction is non-reversible.  So this is no surprise.

@_date: 2016-06-09 17:57:59
Honestly, it does not matter, as long as they don't reverse the trade and let the buyer keep the cheap coins.  If this happens often, it will attract more limit orders which will beef up the order book.  They can compensate the seller out of their own packet, but that is up to them.

I think this was a good lesson for all involved.  Classic supporters learned that Bitcoin does not change without consensus (and a controversial change, by definition, cannot have consensus).
The Core team improved their communication. It also forced major players to lay their cards on the table and certain negative members of the community to drop out or fall in line.
Not sure any of this would have happened without the XT/Classic fiasco.  
@_date: 2016-06-29 13:55:46
The failure of XT and later Classic demonstrates that the community simply does not want big blocks at the moment.  It's as simple as that.  When everyone decides big blocks are good we will get them.  But that time is not now.
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:37:41
Those were idiotic arguments by trolls anyway as it does not take into account money already invested by miners into equipment.  Electricity is only a part of the cost and in fact many miners can get it for cheap or almost free.

Everyone was tricked, although obviously the sellers benefited (assuming they withdrew from Gox in time).  There was no "free market" as Gox was selling Bitcoins that did not exist.  Given the size of Gox, non-Gox traders used that price as a benchmark for their trades also.

Releases / May 26, 2016 / /
Press release Marine Le Pen, President of the National Front
We live in an era that has all the appearance of the end of capitalism. ECB keeps interest rates near zero or even negative, that affect returns on financial investments of the French, but also pose high risks on the banking and life insurance.
The sustained low rates act as a poison in the global banking system, already vulnerable from the crisis of 2008. The survival of the financial oligarchy reactions are to avoid any possible leak of customer money by massive withdrawals outside the banking system. Cash, notes and coins then become the enemy. How to eliminate the currency in sounding form of the realm?
The powerful business lobby Wall Street banks (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs ..) relayed by the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2016, sold two ideas to states and institutions like the EU: virtual currencies or crypto - currencies (the best known is the Bitcoin) and a cashless society. 
Under Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, the limit of cash payments fell from 7500-1000 €, since September 2015. And Michel Sapin we now boasts the advantages of contactless card to pay from 1 euro, pending completion of checks.
More money will be dematerialized and digitized, the more we will lose ownership of our money is one of our fundamental freedoms and restricted space of our privacy. Ultimately, this is a hostage of citizens by private banks and by monitoring all transactions. 
On behalf of the digital progress and the fight against terrorism, to remove cash in favor of virtual currencies is a man's alienation in favor of the global banking system. Besides, why the ruling elite it is in favor of virtual currencies as she continually replenishes the euro, which however only legal tender?
The National Front, firmly rooted in the real economy, remember that a currency is a national public good, given the sovereign people. Therefore, in the context of the implementation of its model of economic patriotism, it will prevent the use of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin in France.

My theory is that miners don't want either SegWit or a block size increase because that would kill the nascent fee market by allowing more transactions and removing competition.  We can see the fees rise here as blocks become full: 
The miners will do whatever they think optimizes their income, regardless of whether it's good or bad for Bitcoin.

The miners can also steal all multi sig wallets the same way. As homework, try to figure out why that does not happen.

It's not a question of "ability" or rights or freedoms.  It's a question of what Coinbase should do - they are the top Bitcoin bank and in a position to influence millions of people.  They also get zero benefit and huge risk from holding so much BTC themselves.  They make absolutely no money from this as they don't lend it or charge fees.

My concern is that IRS ends up getting a similar, incorrect report from Coinbase and ends up saying you had gains when all you did was transfer to an offline wallet.  
On a separate note, the way IRS categorizes Bitcoin as property creates ridiculous complexity for users and for the IRS.  It works for something like stock shares which you trade infrequently and don't usually gift to others as tips.  You definitely don't use your AAPL stock to pay for coffee.

The current policy does not make sense.  Bitcoin should not be subject to cap gains tax especially since people ARE using it as cash for small transactions.  Good luck reporting every cup of coffee you purchase and calculating a gain/loss for it!  They need to reclassify it as currency such that only gains above a certain amount are reportable.
@_date: 2016-12-03 18:25:22
People keep trying these spam attacks and it has no affect on price.  The only result is miners collecting extra fees. Most users just route around it by paying slightly higher fees.

This kind of logic might have worked in early 2011 when Bitcoin was barely used.  But it's not really applicable anymore, heck, the blocks are now consistently almost full.  So we dont really need more transactions to claim that Bitcoin is being heavily used.  That's not really what gets the media's attention anyway, the price increases do.

Actually gifts are not tataxable up to a certain amount ($14k annually per person).  However the basis carries over to the recipient of the gift.  So THEY would need to pay taxes on the gains when they sell.
Unless they find clear cut cases of people buying AND selling AND not reporting those gains it will be hard to make a case.

You don't need massive adoption for Bitcoin to take off.  E.g.: There are only 16 million bitcoins in existence.  If just around 25% of Italians decided to buy 1 BTC each they would not be able to! And this is assuming every bitcoin is up for sale, which it obviously is not.  The supply is very constrained.  Any kind of small demand increase would drive the price through the roof.

And those millions would only end up attracting unwanted attention and flag you as a large bitcoin holder.  You are much better off hodling until The Transformation is complete, making you one of 2,100 possible bitcoin dukes.  That should be enough to allow you to afford good security and staff.  
So big holders may spend a few BTC here and there to pay expenses, but the smart ones will hold on to most of their stash.
@_date: 2015-08-01 22:18:08
I think we agree.  The protocol cannot change, but anyone is free to try and create an alternative, either using a new genesis block (most alt-coins today) or by forking the existing bitcoin chain.  Maybe users would sell the original bitcoin and move to the alt.  Maybe they would not.

Depends on the nature of the bug.  What if it's something that causes a node to crash?  That's consensus, but what good is it to anyone if all nodes are down?  Having many implementations written in different languages reduces the probability of a single fatal bug.

That may be true for now, but other implementations are slowly gaining market share.  What you said is the same as Microsoft in 1998 claiming that IE is the HTML protocol.

@_date: 2015-08-01 22:03:39
The miners can go off and mine a fork which effectively is an altcoin.  This would reduce the hash power for Bitcoin and slow down blocks until the difficulty adjusts.  But they are unlikely to do this for economic reasons as bitcoin profits will outweigh any profits from mining an altcoin.

Most of the coins are held by long term investors, this is well known.  So most of the volume is just speculators trading a tiny portion of all coins back and forth.  What really matters is the 3,600 coins mined per day, as someone has to buy them.  Currently the demand is ~$1,000,000 per day.

In theory, if 99% of miners collude and create a fork, the block creation time for the original chain would be 100 times longer, making it essentially unusable.  The difficulty would not adjust down until 2016 blocks are mined, which would take 200 weeks or 4 years.  So in this way they could effectively destroy the original chain even if non mining users disagree with them.
This would not work with only 51% of miners colluding.

Yes.  They can change the protocol, call it BitcoinB and go mine that.  But the remaining miners and users can continue using Bitcoin.  The only impact is a loss of hash power, which will adjust the difficulty down with time.  So block creation will become slower for a while.

The vendors in Bitcoin's case are miners.  They need to sort all transactions by fee and only process the ones paying the highest fees.

It's a market, you pay the fee and you get to send your transaction.  Pay more than the other guy and it gets confirmed quicker.  Magic!
Too poor to pay?  Here is a hobo nickel 250 bits

I generally don't like censorship, but I agree with the mods here.  At best ethereum is off-topic and at worst it is a scam.  Why give them more publicity?

Thank you.  You made the right decision today.
@_date: 2015-07-24 11:53:54
It's exactly this.  Since Bitcoin cannot be attacked overtly, its enemies will try these dirty tricks to change the protocol and fracture the community in the process. Stand your ground, devs!

There will be a lot of posturing, but no miner will actually do it.  The only option for a fork is to switch to a different PoW (eg SHA-3).  This will also help decentralize mining and make Bitcoin more future proof.

If so, it would be very disappointing that Core developers gave in to their intimidation and threats of forking.  I hope they made their decisions based on technical reasons and not politics.
@_date: 2016-02-09 13:46:45
They are hoping that somehow by voicing support for Classic but not actually deploying it, they can get most of the users to switch.  I don't think it will work.
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:01:26
Even if you support big blocks you have to, at this point, realize that BU is run by fraudsters and scammers.  The remaining BU supporters are delusional.

Here was a proposal that was agreed to by developers, miners and the community.  Instead of compromising he chooses to reject it and continues arguing for a war that has now crashed the price which was finally going up after the agreement.  Well done!

I don't think that's the real issue.  If the meeting resulted in 85% of miners adopting Classic, he would be praising them now.  The fact is he has now backed two losing horses (XT was the first).  The only honorable option for him to save face is to resign.

Meh, the price on a distressed exchange is irrelevant.  If people find out all their USD is lost, they will buy BTC at ANY price just to withdraw something.  The current price factors in the likelihood of that loss.

I'm sure he will think of better ways to implement this.  For example, having a specific set of bytes in a block which trigger the kill switch.

@_date: 2017-04-23 15:01:47
People assumed it would be pegged to USD.  I guess they got their faces ripped off.  I checked out the website and it's shady as fuck.  Who are the people behind it? The transparency page just shows two numbers but there is no actual audit report to verify the USD sum.
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:52:24
Fixing prices?  Wow so Marxism.
Prices need to be determined by the market where people compete to get their transaction included.  The fact that not all miners and wallet provides have adjusted to this reality is just temporary.

The technical issues are simple.  It's more political.  If you switch but most users do not and the fork dies out, you have a huge problem on your hands.

Unfortunately, signaling by nodes does not mean much at all. We all saw BU supporters start up hundreds of fake nodes to make it seem like they have more community support.

First of all, there are simply not enough OTC buyers to absorb $ billions worth of BTC. Second, even if there were, it doesn’t matter as traders now expect a dump and will go short if the coins are touched. A self-fulfilling prophecy.

His only solution now is to start moving the coins randomly all the time so that watching the wallets becomes useless. It will still crash the price the first time he does it.
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:07:23
Barry appealed to the state in the first place by asking his ETF to be approved. Why didn’t he just launch it without approval? We are playing the same game and playing it by the same rules. The ETF is not Bitcoin and regulating the ETF has nothing to do with regulating the operation of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-29 22:35:27
Try to look past your moral reservations. Bitcoin is under attack and the other side is not playing fairly. Barry stands to make millions from ETF fees once it launches. He will crash the price of BTC by splitting and selling it on the market (like he said he will do with BCH).  Those who support Barry’s ETF are insane.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:57:55
It can still cause disruption, just like BCH did, including wild swings in profitability which will periodically steal miners. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:17:07
People aim too low for their “some point”. This will lead to poverty in their future.

@_date: 2017-09-01 21:03:25
It's really a shame that the SEC looks the other way on scammy ICOs yet denies the ETF application where everything was done by the book.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:33:06

EDIT: and if you think Bitcoin is too volatile for that, maybe you should not work for the BITCOIN foundation.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:37:53
As long as you spend only on things that you actually need and you spend the bad money before you spend the good. E.g someone who spent 10,000 BTC on a pizza - did he really need it? Was he starving? Did he not have $15 in fiat to spend on the same?
@_date: 2015-04-04 14:19:33

There is your answer.  People who want to buy Bitcoin don't have much money.  Keep in mind, 3,600 mined bitcoins must be purchased by someone every day.  That's around $1 million at current prices.

March 7, 2014
Not a happy Friday, Idiots.
I have been extremely outspoken about the illegitimacy of the Bitcoin Foundation's current board of directors and the dire need for immediate changes.  Only a swift and thorough overhaul of the Foundation's leadership can preserve Bitcoin's image with regulators, legislators and the general public.  It is unacceptable that the current leadership has not already announced plans to exit gracefully from their positions of power, despite the glaring incompetence and negligence of Chairman Peter Vessenes and Executive Director Jon Matonis.  
This must change.  Now.  
Behind the scenes this week, I solicited the input of dozens of leaders throughout the industry who represent many of the corporate sponsors and lifetime individual members of the Foundation.  The individual response has been nearly unanimous: these gentlemen must go, immediately.  However, the corporate response has been understandably tepid.  Truly good and professional executives have been caught between a rock and a hard place: Vessenes and Matonis are obstinate individuals who will be hard to force from their positions, and a public battle will cause additional media backlash for Bitcoin, which will hurt these executives' businesses.   
I have no similar fiduciary obligations to maintain the peace.  
Moreover, I believe that it is only with proactive measures that we can truly wipe the slate clean from Mt. Gox.  Vessenes and Matonis are pioneers who deserve credit for their early work with the Bitcoin Foundation, but they have also outlived their usefulness in an industry that attempts to grow like the internet despite the inertia of the financial services community and the many regulatory and legislative roadblocks.  
And for better or for worse, with all of its blue-chip sponsors and leading role to date in events such as the Senate Bitcoin hearings and NYDFS BitLicense hearings, the Foundation is the mouthpiece for the entire industry.
 
Peter Vessenes and Jon Matonis are not scapegoats.  They are not innocent bystanders.  And they are not ethically entitled to remain in their board seats through later this year.  
On Monday, I plan to publish a full article which elaborates on these damning facts and much more:  
1) The Foundation never once warned Bitcoin investors about keeping deposits in Mt. Gox, despite clear red flags dating back to at least April 2013.  Nor did the Foundation craft or advocate for best practices such as technical transparency, deposit audits, or appropriate consumer protection disclosures.  This was a colossal failure of leadership. 
   
2) There is evidence that Bitcoin Foundation board members may have had direct access to Mark Karpeles which allowed them to personally deposit and withdraw funds from Mt. Gox, despite persistent delays for other customers. 
3) There is a troubling and inappropriate overlap between Peter Vessenes' staff at his private company, CoinLab, and the Bitcoin Foundation's staff, which goes far beyond shared office space.   
4) The current leadership has shown a stunning disregard for proper communications with its members.  The importance of immediate resignations (rather than gradual) is highlighted by the Board's secret plans to move the Foundation's headquarters to London without input from members and sponsors.
5) Peter Vessenes has had a nine month conflict of interest regarding Mt. Gox given that his company CoinLab was involved in an active multi-million dollar lawsuit against Mark Karpeles and Mt. Gox, following a failed partnership.  Both men remained on the board of directors, and the Foundation failed to draft adequate by-laws that would allow them to address situations such as this where directors had material conflicts, which would compromise their ability to act in the best interests of its members. 
This egregious behavior and negligence may not be the worst of the information to come.  I have been unable to reach representatives of the Foundation for comment on a myriad of other accounting issues related to the treatment of member donations. 
At this week's Texas Bitcoin Conference, I was fortified by near-unanimous agreement (and, at times, applause) that the current leadership must resign or be forced out of their positions on the Foundation.  Yet I have also been warned that I am playing a dangerous game, with cunning and ruthless power brokers.  I have been discouraged by corporate sponsors of the Foundation not to make a public stink which would be "counter-productive" and "irresponsible" for Bitcoin.  Most would prefer to let the Mt. Gox scandal blow over, but I would rather wipe the slate clean definitively, blood or no.  
To the chagrin of the less confrontational, I plan to attack.  And in putting my personal and professional reputation on the line, I will attack ruthlessly, from the front, and (figuratively) shoot to kill.  
By Monday, I expect that either: a) Vessenes and Matonis resign gracefully from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, and announce that their terms will end on an accelerated schedule which coincides with the already scheduled elections in April, or b) the corporate sponsors of the Foundation publicly distance themselves from the organization and clarify that the Bitcoin Foundation no longer represents the true interests of its members.
Otherwise, by Monday at 3pm ET / 12pm PT, I will post my full expose of the unprofessionalism and negligence of the Bitcoin Foundation.  (If I get hit by a bus this weekend, my lawyers will release it.) 
In addition, and immediately upon publishing that expose, I plan to provide a collated and annotated document dump to Fortune and Wired to let them make their own professional judgments of the Bitcoin Foundation and our industry's current leadership.  (I am doing this for free, I might add.)
On Wednesday, I will share those same documents with the broader media community, including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, the Verge, Forbes, the Associated Press and anyone else who asks, and begin lining up on-camera media interviews with CNBC, CBS, Fox News, Al Jazeera and others who have expressed interest in this story to date. 
I assure you, I am ready to go nuclear.  Because this is important. 
Make no mistake: Peter and Jon will either step down from their leadership positions, or the corporate sponsors of the Foundation will quickly assemble and publicly distance themselves from the Foundation, writing off the organization as an illegitimate zombie entity.  I am posting an open letter calling for their swift resignations on Reddit and on the Bitcoin Foundation's own Forum. 
I hope to eat my article, keep the documents that I have to myself (and likely prosecutors as I am likely to be subpoenaed), and redirect the focus of the Bitcoin community from scandal and frustration to that of progress and innovation. 
To Peter, Jon and their supporters:
You have 72 hours.

March 4, 2014
Loyal Idiots,
For those of you who have been regular readers, you know that it is incredibly rare for me to miss a Daily Bit.  These past 72 hours have been among the most stressful of my life, and I have been betrayed by some of those within the industry whom I had trusted. 
Either I was misled by my sources or my sources were misled by Peter Vessenes and Jon Matonis over the weekend.  I reported on Sunday that they were stepping aside gracefully following their absent leadership during the Mt. Gox scandal.  However, yesterday and today I received conflicting reports.  One person close to Vessenes told me that not only does the man have no intention to step down as the Bitcoin Foundation's Chairman, but he intends to run for reelection when his term is up later this year.  I don't know whether I can believe that is true, because it truly would be stunning. 
Then again Rob Ford didn't resign his mayorship either, and he made it onto Jimmy Kimmel. 
(Vessenes did not respond to an email yesterday, and a contact number for the foundation redirected to a full voicemailbox.)  
But that's not what bothers me.  What truly eats at my core stems from what has happened behind the scenes these past few days.  Let me say simply that the failure in leadership across many other firms not named Mt. Gox is stunning.  I will say no more at this point for legal reasons, but I can't remember the last time that I was so professionally disappointed and discouraged by the willful neglect of those who many others would call leaders.  
I now know better. 
I must be meticulous with every detail that I report from both the Mt. Gox saga and now the incomprehensible mismanagement of the Bitcoin Foundation, a group created ostensibly to be the mouthpiece for an entire revolutionary industry.  
Yes, I believe there is troubling circumstantial evidence connecting the two. But this gets into serious territory, and I won't print it until I am 100% confident in what I am writing.  I have been warned by others within the industry that I am now playing a "dangerous game" confronting "powerful" people who are "ruthless and cunning".  
Don't expect me to blink.  
Just please be patient.  I won't back down. 
 
"TwoBit -- AKA Ryan Galt -- AKA Ryan Selkis seems a bit hot headed but his heart is in the right place. I've emailed him a little bit and he's opinionated but he does go (hard) after facts.  With his style he does intermingle opinions and facts and this can be off putting to some people (not my taste).  That said, if you simply rewrote everything in his posts in paired paragraphs, one for the facts and one for his opinions, it might ruffle a few less feathers. While he's (AFAIK) new to the community, he's made some insightful contributions already.
Track record is everything in the fast moving world of Bitcoin; only time will tell the whole story.  But I'm inclined to think his story will work out on the positive side. We shall see."

You are assuming this is an efficient market.  The BTC price is mainly supported by enthusiasts who can only afford to buy a given amount of BTC per paycheck, even if they think the price is going to the moon.  Many of these people have also built up some significant position in BTC and are not comfortable investing more given the risks.
So demand must come from new users, which are not growing very much (for now).

@_date: 2017-05-08 22:28:54
It could also be neither.  Mostly alts trade for BTC, so selling or buying has no impact on BTC price.  The way I see it is most people use them to increase their BTC holdings - pure speculation.  Of course they will not admit it and will sing praises for whatever is the alt of the day just to goose the price.

@_date: 2015-03-29 01:11:01
I dont think that's the case.  Miners put 3.6k btc daily selling pressure on the price brining it down if there is no demand.  The price has been steady, meaning supply and demand are evenly matched right now.  If the supply would halve and demand stay the same, the price would go up.

Think of BU as just another altcoin.  If (big IF) miners ever decide to fork, it's the same as if they decide to mine Dogecoin.  The only impact would be slower block times until the difficulty adjusts.

You only need to pay taxes and report gains when you sell (or spend)
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:06:29
The incentive for miners is equal to (12.5 BTC + fees) * price. The fees are not a huge factor here, even if you assume the 2x fork would have more total fees (debatable - 1mb had huge fees when blocks got full). 
But it's really all about the price.  We also don't see attacks on alt chains because it is simply a waste of money for miners.  They simply follow the money.
@_date: 2016-05-24 04:35:54
If the majority wanted bigger blocks they could have easily forked already with SHA3.  It would actually be more secure as GPU mining would again be viable and centralized Chinese miners would be punished.  The fact that it has not happened means we are dealing with a loud minority, not a majority.

Meh. There was a big push for this several years ago when BTC first hit $1000.  Many wallets already use mBTC.  I don't think it really matters too much and might actually confuse people more ("you mean there are not 21 million BTC max??") A price below $1 (in case BTC falls) also looks cheap and speculative like a penny stock.  So it works both ways.
Ultimately what matters is only what % of total supply you own.

You got it all backwards. ETC survived because some users (notably Barry Silbert) decided to buy the ETC coin increasing its price.

Not necessarily. Basically everyone is getting an airdrop of an altcoin which they can choose to keep or sell.  This has been done many times with other altcoins. Did it affect the BTC price?

For the last time, you can chose to run whatever client software you want.  I dgaf who funds which devs.  If I don't like the software I can install something else in 5 minutes.

I don't know about you, but I will not be intimidated by threats from a domain squatter. In fact, it gives me even more resolve to fight against this. He can even dump all his BTC for BCC and bring the price back down to $10, I have my buy orders ready. 
The only way I would even consider bigger blocks is if we allow SegWit to run for a year and see if there is still network congestion.  And there has to be agreement from all parties that the HF is safe, including Core devs.  Rushing into this without months of testing is insane.

Could be any number things:
* They really want to protect the price from dropping
* They intend to actually buy this much and may push all in as a market order.  This would lead to a rapid price spike (see how shallow the sell side is?)
* None of the above, they are just messing with the market and will pull out the orders if the price actually gets close to them.

Jihan opposes SegWit because it takes away ASICBoost.  Big blocks also naturally favor bigger miners.  I honestly don't know what Ver's motives are, I suspect he is just an idiot who got lucky by investing in BTC early on.

@_date: 2017-07-16 01:24:55
It was not so much the loss, but the cavalier attitude about the fork (they assumed it would not happen). Hopefully they learned a lesson. To be fair Ethereum devs are also to blame by not building in replay protection into the hard fork.

They would be acting against economic incentives.  It would be more profitable to mine honestly and sell the earned coins.  
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:04:47
It's all game theory from here on.  Once SegWit signaling is at &gt;50%, it becomes very risky for a miner not to signal as they would eventually get orphaned.

@_date: 2017-07-14 19:40:43
It was always a big issue.  We had the same thing a few years ago, with ghash.io. And they were actually good people and not hostile towards the community. Anyway, miners left the pool once it became too big so the problem solved itself.  We don't see this happening with AntPool (probably because it is not really a "pool").
The only way to address this seems to be a PoW change, but this would punish all the miners and should be only used as a last resort.  I would like to hear other ideas.
@_date: 2016-07-29 18:42:21
Forks are easy, but you would need to convince some significant miners to come along (or your fork would also need to artificially lower the difficulty).

@_date: 2017-06-24 12:34:36
The only users that matter are the ones that hold Bitcoin and make transactions.  These users are strictly allied with Core developers.  Miners can fork off and mine an altcoin.  If the hashrate becomes insufficient on the Bitcoin chain there is always an option of a PoW change which would decentralize mining again.  Current SHA2 ASIC manufacturers would lose millions. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 18:17:56
Professional miners are not caught off guard by the halving.  They have been planning for this for a long time, so those planning to leave would not mine a single block at a loss out of charity. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:45:05
Lol, if Bitcoin can be threatened by an altcoin forked from the main chain (with drastically reduced hash power, no less) it really deserves to die. Why even bother with 51% attacks when you can simply do a 10% attack and some sloppy social engineering.
And I do mean sloppy. Many exchanges don't even want to list the thing because the BCC symbol is already being used for another altcoin. 
If anything this will hurt the 2x effort when it flops. People will point to it and say this is how much the market wanted a block size increase. Do you want the same price drop for BTC?
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:50:04
This is why some people also push the 0-conf transaction nonsense and are terrified of RBF. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 18:02:16
It depends on the price of both coins.  Miners will mine whichever one is most profitable for them.  They came over to mining ETC very quickly once the price started going up.  So the ratio of hash rates will very closely match the ratio of prices.
@_date: 2016-07-10 09:53:45
It was obvious FUD spread by anti-Bitcoin trolls who are probably paid off by the state.
@_date: 2016-07-24 12:53:18
People complain that the Bitcoin community is toxic, but at least we don't launch 51% attacks on altcoins like this butt bandit Chandler Guo.
@_date: 2016-07-27 14:28:32
At minimum, it sets it back a few years.  Much more analysis needs to be done to understand how a community responds to hard forks and find ways to avoid split coins.
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:10:14
The funny thing is that two years ago people were mourning the death of micro transactions and how it was the end of Bitcoin.  Now we are mourning coffee purchases with all the same rhetoric.  
It all comes down to which transactions should be on chain and which should not.  Even with lightning there will still be on chain transactions that would pay high fees to the miners.  There will also be use cases for which lightning is not suitable.  
The other thing people forget is we have been paying even higher fees ALL ALONG, except they were in the form of inflation.  People might not have noticed this as the price generally increased, but it would have increased even more without the inflation.  With fees it's much more obvious how much you're paying, with inflation the cost is hidden.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:28:32
The fees will rise as soon as it becomes more popular.  Take a look at what happened with Ethereum recently.  
@_date: 2017-06-05 01:19:49
Are we supposed to like Litecoin now because they got SegWit?  No thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:44:28
I would agree with you, but it's quite obvious that Bitmain has been co-opted by the Chinese government.  Jihan is acting against his own economic interests.  The entire blog post was a way to troll the community and crash the price.  This of course means less revenue for him, but that's not of concern at this point.  The PBoC has already been doing this with exchanges for a while, but now they have a much juicier target.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:08:40
The profits will be extra sweet as they are coming straight out of pockets of Roger Ver and BitMain.
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:52:00
The technical discussion is long over.  Now it's a battle for control of Bitcoin.  Do we want Ver and Jihan in control or the current set of Core devs?  I know what my choice is.  I will be fairly quickly transferring my BTC to an exchange if there is a fork away from the Core chain.
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:16:41
Yes, assuming some exchange starts trading ABC.
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:21:53
We will take SegWit activation and then fight against 2x.  They will not fork if the community opposes it.
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:52:52
Somebody tried to crash the price with a massive sell order just before the halving.  I'd say they failed and we are recovering already.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:12:44
I get that.  But this feature is not just hard to find, it impossible to find unless you read this blog post.  When I updated my app I knew it was there but could not figure out how to turn it on.  Maybe something like an "advanced settings" menu would be better.

By definition, that means the proposed upgrades are not worth doing.  Changes should be made only if the community wants them.  Keep in mind Competitor A only polled a tiny portion of users and the miners were bullied into implementing a fork by the dev team.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:27:07
As time goes by, more and more people "get it"
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:26:36
If someone wants to pay more and not use SegWit they are free to do so.  But assuming they are acting rationally they would obviously prefer to pay less. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:18:03
Some loser put up a 200 BTC sell wall
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:38:17
The only way to stop this is to 1) make Bitcoin inflationary and/or 2) make it seem like a scam so nobody would want to use it.
1) Bitcoin has a 21m coin limit.  But this is easy to work around by simply creating more clones which suck up investor money.  Have you been investing in alts?  Think about it.
2) Very easy.  Launch a bunch of ICOs and Ponzi schemes which will ultimately fail and discredit this new asset class.  Furthermore you can dump any funds raised on the market to depress the BTC price.
If you think governments will just let Bitcoin go to the moon, you are in for a surprise.

Obviously Doge is the future.  Both BTC and ETH fees are too high /s
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:48:36
As long as fees are less than storing and transporting gold, cryptocurrency still offers an advantage.  Quick and cheap payments can be provided by 3rd party providers (yes you will be able to buy your coffee with Bitcoin, but it will be off-chain.  Imagine preloaded debit and credit cards).
The real win here is taking back control of your money from the government.
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:27:46
Do you not get that if people stop using Bitcoin the fees would drop?  By definition, the fee is what people are willing to pay, it is decided by the market. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:54:26
Bitcoin is doing fine, but we would probably be at 10k already if it wasn't for Ver and Jihan blocking SegWit.

@_date: 2017-06-23 20:31:26
Nobody is doing a fucking 2MB fork, I hope people realize this about SegWit2x.  It's just a roundabout way for miners to activate SegWit and save face.  For a 2MB fork user buy-in would be required and that is a whole separate battle.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:12:18
While this must be frustrating you actually got lucky in some ways.  Two weeks ago was the peak and an absolutely horrible time to buy.
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:50:50
Very bullish technical indicator 
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:27:08
Keep in mind that it is very easy for Bitcoin's enemies to pump the market cap of altcoins to make it seem like Bitcoin is losing ground.  For example, Roger Ver has (had?) 100k+ BTC which can easily eat through the entire Ethereum order books of all exchanges combined.  Even a "small" buy of 10,000 BTC would send the price skyrocketing.  We may have already seen this happen.
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:44:17
I can guarantee you that 2MB blocks would fill up IMMIDIATELLY.  Look at the transaction backlog if you don't believe me.  SegWit is a better solution not so much because it allows for more transactions but because it enables second layer solutions required for true scaling.

There are many smart contracts that don't require a third party, hence the "smart"

@_date: 2017-06-08 13:20:55
You are assuming current users would not start transacting more and we have also seen a massive influx of new users in the past month.  But even if you're right and it gives us a few months, is it really worth the trouble of going through a hard fork which could likely result in a chain split?

While this might suck for people who lost coins, it's good for the ecosystem as a large portion of BTC sits in limbo and cannot be sold.

Why are you posting this?  We must keep saying that the lighting network is vaporware and cannot even exist to push the big block agenda. /s

Most users are still running Core.  The miners can fork to 2MB if they like, but they still need to convince the users to switch.

Does anyone actually care what this butt bandit says?  David Seaman is a well-known anti-Bitcoin troll and not very good one at that.  He spent the past few years promoting altcoins that subsequently crashed to zero.

These are very good points, and in a bizarre way Ethereum may have saved Bitcoin.  Now when a hard fork is proposed we can simply parade the ETC/ETH debacle as a counter-argument.  Much better to have a real-world example as opposed to conjectures about what would happen.

The only reason I would even entertain the NY proposal is to get SegWit, but this would be capitulating to miners who have been very disruptive to Bitcoin and do not deserve to be rewarded.  The way things are going I only see two options 1) stay with the status quo and whatever consequences that may have 2) nuclear option of a PoW change to decentralize mining (ideally with a proof of storage so that miners are incentivized to keep the blockchain from bloating).
My heart prefers option 2, but my wallet prefers option 1

I don't think all GPUs in the world combined would even mine a single block at this point.
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:39:56
ETH is not currently used as a payment mechanism so damage is limited to traders.  For Bitcoin this would cause confusion and disruption for all merchants and services that accept BTC.

Either UASF or whatever Core is doing.

I don't think they are behind them directly.  But they are encouraging them by not having SEC crack down.

Coinbase should have been investing in upgraded infrastructure instead of dabbling in altcoins and preaching about scalability.  A missed opportunity, sad!

I think they are still hugely profitable given the electricity cost.

This is why I'm still bullish on BTC.  Is ETH being used for actual economic purposes like this?  Not that I know of; it's only being used to speculate on ICOs.  
@_date: 2015-02-01 01:32:18


Yeah, sounds about right.

Fees pay for network security to keep it decentralized.  You can lower the fees but you will end up with a centralized system.  The right balance is probably somewhere in between with things like payment channels and lightning network.

This was predicted a long time ago.  MSM is only now catching up.  Better late than never, I suppose.

You are assuming the hashrate will stay constant.  Also,  the wipeout only works in one direction, non-BIP148 cannot wipeout BIP148.

I guess quite a few Ethereum investors got their faces ripped off.  All it takes is for one ICO to not go well.

They simply could not imagine a future where a currency is not controlled by anyone.  But still not a bad prediction given that it was 30 years ago.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:54:15
If Bitcoin becomes the global currency, that means the world's wealth will be concentrated in the hands of early adopters who can then shape the world according to their vision.  This will fix many of the problems created and perpetuated by the current class of elites.
As to wheather it is a possibility, nobody knows, but keep in mind people said Bitcoin market cap will never reach $1 billion, $10 billion, etc.  And yet, here we are.
