In theory, yes. But in reality it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Last year I found it didn't work in most ATMs. Recently I got my identity verified with Xapo and they raised my withdrawal limits. My card has worked much better since then, but I am not sure if getting verified actually helped or it they just improved their system at the same time. Regardless, since I got verified I have withdrawn from ATMs probably 10 times (between like $100-$600 NZD per transaction) and they have all worked perfectly. I have used ASB and BNZ ATMs. You have to choose credit as the withdrawal option. Also I usually choose the options that says "do not display balance or print receipt". Sometimes the ATM will charge you an extra $3 NZD withdrawal fee on top of the Xapo fees. I usually find that I lose around roughly 5-7% with ATM fees and Xapo fees and the Xapo spread and currency conversion cost. Of course this depends on how much you withdraw because some of the fees don't scale with the amount, so the fee % gets lower the more money you withdraw in a single transaction.

If she is going to work here, then she will need to open a bank account. Most employers will only pay wages into a bank account. I am not sure what the requirements are for opening a bank account. But at a minimum they would want some ID and proof of address. I have heard that some banks want proof that you are employed as well, but I am not sure if that is the case with all of them. You might try emailing some of the banks here and asking them what they need. 
The main banks in NZ are:
* Kiwibank (government owned, I believe)
* BNZ 
* ASB (Australian owned)
* ANZ (Australian owned)
* Westpac (Australian owned)
There are also a few smaller banks.
In regards to the Xapo debit card. I have one and it works very well, but can be unreliable at times. I find that it usually works for ATM withdrawals and online purchases, but often does not work for in store purchases. I am not sure if I would want to have to rely on it as my only source of money.
Feel free to ask any more questions and I will do my best to help

As others have said, localbitcoins is the best option in NZ. The NZ banking system is one of the best in the world. You can send money from any bank to any other bank within the country for free and it usually arrives in just a few hours during business days. And if the person you are dealing with on localbitcoins has the same bank as you, then the funds will arrive immediately even on the weekend. This makes using localbitcoins especially easy in NZ, because you don't have to deal with bank fees or long waiting times for the money to clear.

I use my Xapo card in New Zealand. It costs about 4-6% for a standard transaction including all the fees and everything. I haven't tried withdrawing from an ATM but there is an additional fee for that.

At that time there was a lot of fear that if Cyprus defaulted on it's debt it might have a domino effect and take down other European countries as well. And possibly even more significantly for the price of bitcoin, people were worried that other Eurozone countries would seize money from bank accounts as they had done in Cyprus.

You hit on possibly the most misunderstood aspect of bitcoin. It is not socialism friendly. One of the primary goals of socialism is to make society more equal by using force to redistribute wealth (i.e. to take money from the rich people/corporations). Bitcoin **CANNOT** be forcibly redistributed. Someone can have insanely large amounts of bitcoin and no one can touch it.

I don't think it is very easy to do. The reason there aren't many people selling bitcoin via paypal is because of scammers. The scammer would transfer the paypal dollars and receive the bitcoin, but then they would do a chargeback (I don't know a lot about how this works) which means they would get a full refund at the expense of the person selling the bitcoin. The end result being that the scammer has both the paypal dollars and the bitcoin and the seller has nothing and there is no way for the seller to get his bitcoin back.

Yes the sidebar is a great place to start. Have a look at the Getting Started, FAQ and Common Myths pages. Don't worry about taking it all in right away. If you don't understand something just skip over it and read/watch something else. It will all make sense at a latter time. 
I would highly recommend that you play around with the small amount you have for at least a few weeks before you consider buying any more. If that's what you want to do.
Bitcoin apps and services are becoming more and more user friendly, but there is still room for improvement. Certain newer wallets such as Breadwallet make it much easier for new people to use without the fear of doing something wrong and losing there bitcoin. 
I you only have small amount of bitcoin, just keep it on Breadwallet on you iPad. But don't forget to write down the 10 word seed phrase that Breadwallet generates. This seed can be used to recreate your wallet (and recover your funds) on another device even if you lose your iPad and didn't have a backup.
If on the other hand, you have a lot of bitcoin. You should look into cold wallets. These are offline wallets, usually written on paper. If they are created correctly they are impossible to hack/steal from.

I used to follow this guy religiously. His predictions are very apocalyptic, especially for the US. After following for years I slowly started realizing his predictions rarely ever come to pass. In 2009 he said the USD would collapse by September. And during the BP oil spill he predicted something like 50 million people in the southern states would move north to get away from the toxic effects of it. He has literally made hundreds of predictions of events occurring around certain dates that did not come to pass. 
He is certainly an intelligent guy, and I think he truly believes his predictions. I don’t think he is a scammer. But he is deluding himself and his followers. People listen to him for the same reasons they go to psychics and believe in Astrology. Many of predictions are so vague that they almost have to come true in some way. And other predictions are so huge and life changing that they keep people entertained and coming back for more, and when they don’t come true he will say that he got the timing wrong.
To his credit, he has been a bitcoin bull since at least 2011, maybe even further back. And in fact I first discovered bitcoin through him.

I second this. MultibitHD is the best desktop wallet imo. Nice and easy to use. Painless wallet recovery from seed phrase. I have tested the recovery multiple times with no issues.

It is very similar to if a central bank reduced it's money printing by half. Essentially the inflation rate for bitcoin will go from about 9% down to about 4.5% and it will never go back up. Furthermore it will continue to decrease forever.
It's a very good thing for the price in the long run because it helps to reduce the supply of bitcoin vs demand.
@_date: 2016-06-11 00:40:33
Yeah, first they convert your bitcoin into USD (or GBP, EUR) at a rate that changes, but often you lose over 1%. Then they charge you about 3 % to convert from USD to NZD. 
It is much better if you are using it to buy things online in USD because there won't be a currency conversion charge.
Since I wrote my comment 5 months ago I have had a lot more  experience with my Xapo card. You have to choose "credit" when making a purchase via eftpos. I have found that it works with some eftpos machines and doesn't work with others. But even the eftpos machines where it does work it will still fail sometimes. It has always worked perfectly for online purchases and I have never had any problems with this regardless of the purchase currency.
It has serious problems with withdrawing cash at ATMs. It doesn't work with many banks ATMs (BNZ seems to be the best that I  have found) and I have never been able to withdraw more than $200 NZD at a time. Also it works better with the quick withdraw options. Considering that they also charge you a fee for ATM withdrawal (about $5 NZD if I recall correctly) you can end up paying a pretty high % when withdrawing cash.
If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:46:33
Because if you keep your coins on Coinbase, then you don't actually own them, you just get the promise that they will give you your coins at some point in the future when you withdraw them. If Coinbase gets hacked, then you could lose all your coins. Large scale hacks of bitcoin exchanges have happened many times before. Better not to take that risk.
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:26:14
They used to make money by loaning out funds to trade with on their exchange and charging an interest rate of 36% per year. But the PBoC has told them to stop that, so they will almost certainly have to start charging fees now.
It is likely that the top 3 bitcoin exchanges in china will get together and decide on a trading fee that they will all charge. This way they don't have to compete themselves out of business
Edit: If I had to take a guess I would say the trading fee will be no more than 0.03%, but it could be even as low as 0.01%.
Edit2: It looks like I was wrong about the fees. All 3 chinese exchanges have announced they will be charging 0.2%, which is significantly more than I was expecting.

Most people fail to understand what bitcoin is and where it is going. That’s ok, it took me a while to get it. 
Let’s imagine a future in which all national currencies have been replaced by bitcoin. The most important change I would expect to see would be that governments can no longer print money (QE). They would be completely limited to what they can tax and borrow. This would mean no central bank buying of government bonds which would lead to much higher bond yields. 
On top of that I would expect tax revenue to decline due to how difficult it is for the government to determine how much bitcoin you own and how much income you have made. This is especially true for business owners and people who are self employed than for employees.
All of this would have the effect of greatly reducing government spending. It would mean huge cuts to social services such as health care and pensions. 
Consider the austerity that Germany is enforcing on Greece at the moment. That is essentially what bitcoin would enforce on the whole world. Government spending will be bound to what can be taxed and borrowed. And any government attempting to borrow too much would be treated very harshly by the lending markets.
To me this seems to be much closer to the world anarcho-capitalists desire than to what many on the left want.

I don't have any balance on the site at the moment so I am unable to test trading. I can only confirm that I was able to login.

Don't burn fiat. If you burn fiat you are enabling the FED to print more money without causing inflation. Instead use it to purchase something like bitcoin, or at least a pizza.

The truth is that no one knows the future and anyone who claims to should not be taken seriously.
I can give you many reasons why I think bitcoin will be worth $100,000 by 2020 and I might even be able to make it sound like a certainty, but I assure you it is not a certainty, it is just some ramblings of a human brain.
Nevertheless, assuming bitcoin isn't destroyed by a bug or malicious devs or something then I believe that the finite nature of bitcoin will drive the price much higher in the decades to come. But it could take a long time to get there. We have been drifting down for most of the past year and a half. Who is to say that we can't do that for another year or three or five.

I had never even heard of a canary. Link to Wikipedia for those interested

It's working for me too.

Not sure why your getting downvoted for this

Hindsight is 20/20. The truth is there was no way of knowing for sure.

25 BTC is mined approximately every 10 minutes. This equals 3600 coins per day or about $883,008 USD worth of coin per day.

About a year ago I would have agreed with you completely. But since then I have been trading a lot on OKCoin.cn (and Huobi, BTCChina) and I would say I am now quite certain that they (OKCoin) are not scamming anyone. I personally think that at one point they may have been faking the trading volume, but I haven't seen any evidence of it in a long time. On the other hand I do see signs that BTCChina is faking at the moment, but I don't think they have always been.
@_date: 2015-03-16 06:04:43
I couldn't agree more.

Bitcoin has limited supply, fiat does not.

I wouldn't really say it is accelerating. US inflation has been very steady and relatively low since the early 80s. Over the past 100 years it has been as high as 20% on several occasions. Most of the decline of the purchasing power was lost during those high inflation periods.

I haven't traded Huobi in a while, but I don't believe they charge fees for spot BTC/CNY
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:17:17
If you think that's scary. Take a look at most developing nation's currencies since 1913 (South Africa for example). Makes the USD look like gold.

Based off of the preceding tweets, I believe it was Larry Summers.

I not sure if it is even possible. But what I mean is I would like to see a system where the house (even if decentralized) is taking only a very small percentage (or none at all) of every win. 
The fee collected by the house is the only thing that makes the player lose money over the long term. If there is no fee then you would break even over the long term, but it would still be worth it for the fun. 
Edit: Spelling
@_date: 2015-10-25 07:41:52


I am pretty sure the fee only applies to the USD pairs not the CNY ones.

Allow me to explain. Say we have 10 people each putting in $1 per game over 1000 games. The cost to enter is $1 and the potential prize is $10. Your odds of winning are 1 in 10 (or 0.10). By the end of the 1000 games each player would have on average the same about of money has when he started because the buy-in is equal to the prize multiplied by the odds.   
This would truly be fair. I'm not saying it would be economically feasible to run the game like this. But maybe it would if you sold ads or something. 
If on the other hand, the house takes 1% of all winnings. Then 1% of $10 per game = $0.10 per game for the house. This means that over 1000 games the house has taken $100 from the players. Which equals an average loss of $10 per player. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 08:13:34
I like this idea. Especially if there were no fees (or very very small fees). I would definitely play.

Not necessarily. The purchasing power of bitcoin could have stayed the same and fiat lost 7%.

As someone who grew up paying attention to this guy, you are absolutely correct. It took me far longer than it should have to realize Clif High's predictions almost never come true and even when they do it's usually a huge stretch to make the connection. I wasted a lot of my teenage life listening to this guy and preparing for apocalypse. I remember he said the US dollar was going to collapse in the summer 2009, it didn't.

Yeah, this is the case in New Zealand as well. It pretty much always works in some shops and doesn't work at all in others

That's possible but I doubt they even really know what bitcoin is, let alone if it poses a threat to them.

Bought 0.8 BTC through them when BTC price was $79. I paid about 17% above Mt Gox. Well worth it, with price over $300 now.

Just logged into BTCChina. Their site still says 0.3% trading fee.
