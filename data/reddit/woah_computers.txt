Thanks a lot! Had to look up what a Jersey cow was haha. Thanks again
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:23:45
Thank you! It queries the balance of the address every minute, then takes the difference between the current balance and the balance a minute ago.
So if multiple transactions are sent in less than a minute, then the extension will report the difference as one transaction.
It's not really meant to be used as a definitive way to confirm individual transactions. Just a casual way to keep an eye on the activity of an address.
@_date: 2014-06-30 06:57:27
It's not for Android, but I wrote a Chrome extension called [Popcoin]( that lets you watch 6 addresses and notifies you when the balance changes. Give it look.
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:40:54
[Here you go.]( Popcoin lets you casually watch an address for transactions. No cost at all.

@_date: 2013-10-25 22:50:58
What do you work with nowadays? Just curious.
@_date: 2013-10-27 10:44:12
I've updated the extension. It now LOCALLY stores the last address you've entered, so you don't have to keep setting it up every time you quit Chrome. **If you don't like this, a "wipe data" button is simply two clicks away, which completely erases the address in storage.**
I've also added a "check balance" button so you can grab the balance of the currently stored address on the fly. There are now more transitions and things are smoother. I managed to up memory efficiency to over 5 times the previous amount by not having the background page running constantly.
Finally, if you guys dig this can you please give me a quick rating on the Chrome Store? Thanks mad much.
EDIT: Code is now on Github. It's atrocious looking, but hey, I'm new to this web dev stuff.  Please do tell me if there are any glaringly obvious changes I could make to make things better. View it here:

It's definitely a work in progress. Gotta fix a bug, get a better housing (other than a fruitbox), and overall nicer presentation. 
I think it's pretty safe to use with cold storage wallets since it's not directly connected to the web. Can someone confirm/dispute this for me?
@_date: 2013-11-01 07:37:37
Not from China, just wondering what consumers in China buy that they do it directly from factories. Or is it like a warehouse? 
@_date: 2013-10-15 02:40:27
Yeah Python is running on a computer. I wanted to minimize risk (if any) and not have the Arduino directly connected to the web.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:28:26
Thanks for the memories. If it wasn't for this post I may have forgotten about this book for the rest of my life haha.

@_date: 2013-10-20 01:20:37
Can I try?
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:12:25
I won't deny that, but I won't confirm it.
@_date: 2013-10-14 03:14:34
Someone else tried to do the same it looks like. Maybe I should add a donation link.
@_date: 2013-10-25 18:54:07
Please tell me what you guys think. It's my first jump into web development. Also if you're wondering why it needs the Blockchain.info permission, it's only to search for the address you input and get the total balance number.
**popCoin does not ask for or store any personal data whatsoever. Any address you input is stored only for the browser session, getting cleared once Chrome quits.**
@_date: 2013-10-15 23:12:40
Made another version! Here it is: 
@_date: 2013-10-25 19:29:56


Where did you get that? I'm new to this and all, but I don't ask for the "storage" permission, and the chrome.storage.* API isn't even used in my code. If you input an address and quit Chrome, (actually quit it, not just close the last window) then upon starting Chrome up again the extension will ask for a "new address", and not display the "change address" button.
I'll add the option to store addresses &amp; multiple address in a couple days.

Not sure honestly. I'm not finished fully developing it.
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:13:01
I agree. Plus blue is my favorite color. But the LCD is pretty readable in person. It's just the camera has issues focusing on the text.
@_date: 2013-10-16 02:37:32
It was just something I made for fun. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:50:46
A non-persistent event page wouldn't stop it from running in the background. If you look in the javascript code, it checks periodically for the balance total using the chrome.alarms API. The background.js would still get called whenever the total was being checked for, even if the popup isn't open.
The idea here is that you don't need to have a Chrome window open to receive notifications of BTC being sent to you. Kind of like an app. You read the code, no personal data whatsoever is being collected.
It didn't occur to me that that might bother some. Looks like I'll be adding ~~"keep running after Chrome closes [yes/no]" option~~ the background permission as an optional one. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:28:41
I made a a Chrome extension called [popCoin](  
It gives you HTML5 style notifications whenever coins are received or sent by an address.
@_date: 2013-10-14 03:24:42
Its tough to get the camera to focus. I'll shoot a new video tomorrow after I clean things up some
@_date: 2013-10-14 02:47:09
No you're the first. Much appreciated!
@_date: 2013-10-15 02:39:33
It just looks at HTML from Blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:25:18


NO MAN. I'll do it. There may be more people like you. And besides, it's good practice for me. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 02:33:21
Thanks a lot man!

It lets you casually watch any address you specify, giving you HTML5 style notifications whenever coins are sent/received to that address. Let me know what you think.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:22:18
I'll hack up a design and let you know.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:23:26
@_date: 2013-10-15 23:55:04
It's a lot simpler than that! I wanted this to be safe for using with a cold storage wallet, so the arduino itself is not actually connected to the web.
The script running on the computer sifts the HTML of blockchain.info and returns and grabs whatever the latest payment was. It then sends that number over a serial connection to the Arduino. I'm still waiting on a Bluetooth serial chip so I can make this thing wireless.
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:13:42
Thanks man. I'll think about a lot smaller version.
@_date: 2013-10-15 02:45:25
I figure it'd just be something cool for a business/restaurant, or organization to sort of really show when they receive tips. Plus I expect people  would be more likely to tip if there was some sort of response, vs just inanimate paper. 
But most of all I was bored and just wanted to see if I could do it. I'm novice at programming and had fun making this
@_date: 2013-10-27 05:45:55
That's a bug. I've worked it out in this update I'm gonna push tomorrow. The extension will also now save data, but will wipe the data with the push of a button.
Did you happen to suspend your computer or change the address you were monitoring when this happened?
@_date: 2013-10-14 02:21:31
Idk what specific tone it is, I'll have to look it up later. But the LCD comes with a buzzer on it and you can program different tones and tone lengths

Sorry for the small amount. Don't have a lot to give out.

Very cool!
This is similar to what I did a month ago. 
I wanna take things to the next level and make a mad extravagant set of things happen, instead of just a tune and  a light. Can't wait for finals to be over with this week.
@_date: 2013-10-16 00:57:51
Haha yeah sorry about that
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:21:38
Sort of. Event pages don't by themselves prevent that. The major reason they were added is for memory efficiency. Having a background page running in the background (regardless of Chrome being open or not) vs only calling the background page when it is asked for.
My code does the latter. The only reason it continues to run after Chrome windows are closed is because I explicitly set the "background" permission as mandatory, which is the cause of it not quitting when Chrome closes. That permission is entirely separate from event page persistence. 
If I make the "background" permission optional, then the extension will explicitly ask you whether or not you want to enable it to run after Chrome closes.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:00:26
I could make a device like that for you. But it would have to be tethered to a computer (bluetooth or USB cable option) in order to check the price via the internet.
EDIT: Just for reference, here's something I've done. It was just a prototype though:
