Banks can loan out many multiples of what is deposited through a process called "fractional reserve lending". Essentially, the bank's reserve only has to be a fraction of what it 'can' lend to others - a bank could choose to lend conservatively (substantially less than 10x of deposits) and be well within it's reserve requirements.
Now, a system which you describe above would be much safer, although extremely conservative because it would reduce the money supply, but you're not describing what bank are allowed to do.
Basically, if you deposit $10,000 to a bank, they could lend out $100,000 and collect interest on this money created out of thin air. The system works out well as long as debts are paid, but when there are too many defaults on debt, (as well as derivative financial products built on top of these debts that are many multiples of the original debt), you end up collapsing the system like what happened a whole 10 years ago.
So then the banks created quantitative easing which was basically a tool to create trillions of made up currency that went into bank reserves, so the reserve numbers you've quoted are essentially bogus and taxpayers are on the hook to pay for it.

I appreciate your critiques, although I think my general logic holds true.
I'm sure you already understand, but through a series of loans (technically infinite), an initial $10,000 deposit can be turned into a total of $100,000 added to the money supply although not all of it is used for loans (i.e., treasury bonds, other assets, excess reserves). 
It's possible I haven't fully thought this through, but please bear with me.
Let's say I deposit $100 to a bank, the bank reserves $10 and the bank then lends you $90. You use the $90 to purchase a jacket. The seller of the jacket deposits the $90 into a bank and the process starts all over again with the bank reserving $9 and lending out the remaining $81. The total money supply is not $100, it's $100 + $90 now. I hear your point regarding the liability side and I'm still giving that some thought. It seems the reverse could occur to offset the increase, but I haven't found an example to illustrate.
Quick summary using your jacket example. The total jacket supply on a loan of 10 jackets appears to be 100 to me (the potential high limit). 
Money supply equation: Deposit*(1/reserve ratio). 
10*(1/10%) = 100.

You're right, I suppose I'm picking on the wrong aspect, although as you mention, people failing to pay loans gets us into scenarios where banks have to cover for money that doesn't originally exist. However, it's clear the central bank creates money out of thin air and that's where I should have focused on with fractional reserve lending. The QE programs significantly increased back reserves, but without the need for an actual customer deposit.
