I have a brief amount of experience working in the mortgage industry, and am curious what sort of conventional loan product would offer 100% LTV at a lower interest rate.  I thought all those "deals" disappeared after the market imploded in 2007 and was re-regulated around 2009.  Also, you say you can put down as much as you want, which would mean you aren't doing 100% LTV...but if they are offering that again, good for you.  Must mean you have great credit, too.  :)

I feel ya. I really can't trace when I first learned of bitcoin but it could possibly have been as early as 2011 or 12, when I first joined reddit. I was well aware of it when it spiked in 2013, then I watched it drop all the way to near $200...still didn't buy in. Oh well :)

when you say "market buy" does that mean you are buying many different types of coins at once? If so, that seems like a pretty smart approach to dollar cost averaging and a way to eliminate some of the stress of trying to decipher which ones of all these many options might be best long term.

thank you, that make sense. I guess the scenario I (incorrectly) imagined would be more like a mutual fund of different currencies, which it seems you could accomplish by buying bitcoin weekly then converting to any number of different coins you wanted to hold. I've been watching cryptos for a couple of years but still don't own any. It's still mind numbing to see the stories of those who mined thousands of bitcoin when it was worth pennies, so I get overwhelmed looking at the market now and thinking "I've missed all this so far, there's no way I'll pick the right one now." lol Story of my life.
