This is so awesome.
I have applied on behalf of the Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's Society in Christchurch New Zealand. My wife worked there as a Physiotherapist and they rely completely on donations and membership fees (from patients) to fund the entire charitable organisation.
I would be so proud and happy to tell them they were successful for any funds you deemed appropriate, but if not, you are still a legend!

It is just BitCoin. I ran the generator for "-i bitcoin" so it ignored case and I set it to run again every time it succeeded. I just picked the one that looked the best without lots of lowercase-uppercase.

It still doesn't explain why the foundation is needed. Just says you offer memberships and solicit donations.
The article just explains why Bitcoin is needed.
The question “Why would our organization want to support bitcoin and the foundation?” - needs the "bitcoin and the" removed.
No links on the site truly explain the need for a foundation.
Not trolling, genuinely want to know. &lt;3 bitcoin and have invested.

I don't think I have seen Josh say this, but I saw his forumites posting that the BFL chips are downclocked.

His service will usually be worth the same amount. BTC is worth it's USD equivalent (currently).
He should capitalize by offering a discount for bitcoin purchasers. He can profit off this small discount due to his savings compared to processing other payment options.

I also had a USB powered hub. Belkin. Off the RPi approved list. This did nothing to help.

It's a suggestion by the reserve bank that all banks use this technique to save themselves.
What's even more stupid is that the socialist Green party is using a Reserve Bank decision/recommendation (which is a good one) to promote themselves by blaming the National government. No government has control over the Reserve Bank. If the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party was in control, the same recommendation would still come from the Reserve Bank.
The choice is simple. Bank collapses - everybody bails them out.
Bank collapses - only their customers bail them out.
There isn't a third choice, because a bank collapsing costs the country much more than both combined.

If I were you I'd just reinstall the client completely. Bock 6500 is quite a long time ago and the time you save fixing the issue will have been avoided by the reinstall and redownload of the block chain.
There are ways to rescan, eg ./bitcoin-qt /rescan which has solved some of my problems in the past.
You can find all the command line options here. 
But like I said, back up the wallet. Uninstall (probably an old out of date client!) and redo the lot. Then restore your wallet.
