Okay so if there was a consensus about changing the block size, we’d have to hard fork Bitcoin and make it a new currency, but what would happen with the names ? Would we still call it Bitcoin and rename the « old » (the actual btc) to something else ? What would happen to everyone’s wallet ?
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:42:46
The community is divided between doubling the block size or finding other solutions (LN, Segwit, RSK). The other solutions are opt-in if I get it right, but what about the block size change ? Who decides to change it and how is it done ?
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:40:09
Nope, only 166

Thanks a lot!

Where are you from and what countries are you talking about ?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:36:54
I meant a correction to something like 15,000€ (18.000$) like it was this morning or yesterday, not a huge drop to 12,000€ ! 
Perhaps it'll happen, perhaps not...

R.I.P. - My hopes for a dip
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:37:42
Coinbase (And any other exchange) holds your private keys, so it's not really **your** Bitcoins until you withdraw or transfer to your wallet. It's basically like a bank, it holds your coins for you but it can also get hacked (See the Mt. Gox case with the loss of 740,000 BTCs). 
Bottom line: Store your Bitcoins in **your own** wallet if you don't plan to day trade.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:13:52
Yeah that made me learn not to day trade Bitcoin, from now I'll be holding
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:41:50
The problem with day trading is exactly what LifeLikeJay said, you just **don't** know and there's no way to predict (At least for us outsiders and little holders). I sold at 15'5k as it was yesterday's high and counted on buying low at 14'5k, but instead it kept growing to 16'9k and I'm totally fucked 'cause if I buy now it would mean I lost approx 18-20% for nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:38:04
I would fucking die if it happened to me
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:34:45
Holy shit did you see that ?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:09:36
Waiting for a correction to buy like...

GDAX is an exchange platform from the Coinbase guys. Both are not a good solution to hold BTC for a long time, I suggest you to take a look at hot wallets or cold storage wallets (The best way but the least convenient when it comes to spending).
Sending BTCs may take a while depending on the fees you paid and the network's congestion, it could take 8 hours like it could take a few days.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:21:07
When it dips...
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:40:48
I did ! Was actually hoping for a 10% swing but it's better it's a beginning I guess... What are your predictions ? Everybody seemed to panic sell for a second 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:06:49
Sell sell sell
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:45:07
So that was the sell off ? The one from last week lasted a whole day

Really hesitating to do that, CME’s futures are causing fomo to my poor heart
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:27:08
HELP HOW DO I REVERSE IT
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:59:37
For the few next days
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:05:47
Sold at 18k thinking it would dip a little, now where’s the dip ?

How come there are other Tor nodes on this list? How did they get there?
@_date: 2019-03-04 00:59:58
Nope, look at the last instruction:


I should already be getting inbound connections since I followed those steps. At least inbound connexions from other Tor nodes I guess. And I should be reachable on [

Didn’t know about the necessity to input the wallet password to sign a transaction on bitcoind, Thanks.
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:55:10
That's also the conclusion I came to. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-03-07 02:57:17
How would they control the process?
@_date: 2019-03-07 02:45:31
So you’re saying that in the case of a SSH-controlled distant server, only password-protecting the session and the wallet enough? Considering the use of ufw to only allow one specific remote IP.
@_date: 2019-03-08 00:30:43
BlueWallet is a indeed a good starting point ! From there, you can try their Lapp Store and gamble some sats or pay for pixels on Satoshi’s place.

I got one in the afternoon but it's gone now. Back to 8 active outbound connections.
@_date: 2019-03-08 00:12:24
So the « ultimate » way to protect a Core nose from remote attacks is to rpcbind it to 127.0.01. A local attacker couldn’t do much as well as it would require to setup an IPv4 proxy locally and MITM the infos. Did I get it right? 
Didn’t mean to be a critic either. I was just asking as I’m concerned about the risks I’m exposing my node to.
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:15:05
Running a Tor node should allow other Tor nodes to make an inbound connection.
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:53:33
I chose to use Tor as a proxy to communicate with other Tor nodes. This node right here doesn't seem to communicate with anyone ahah
@_date: 2019-03-13 02:10:06
Already saw this question, it was about forcing IPv4 by disabling IPv6. I'm trying to have both
@_date: 2019-03-07 23:42:40
If the funds are in the Core wallet, there are some dangerous commands an attacker can type: createrawtransaction, then signrawtransaction... 
I was actually wondering if knowing those RPC infos would put the funds in a LN wallet at risk.
@_date: 2019-03-07 00:35:45
That was really informative, thank you.
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:09:16
Are you sure ? My understanding was the following:
* A regular full  node stored in a SSD (1TB) will write only once the whole blockchain then append new blocks indefinitely, until it is full. *That makes a total of 1 writing.*
* A 64GB pruned full node stored in a SSD (124GB) will download the whole blockchain, delete it gradually and keep only the latest part. Then it will append the new blocks and delete the older ones. *That makes a lot or* ***re****writings.*
Unless the writings are counted in bytes written ? And in that case I'm fine.

IPv6 (eth0) : port 22 and 8333 are reachable
IPv6 (wlan0) : port 22 and 8333 are reachable
IPv4 : port 22 is reachable, port 8333 is unreachable
Interestingly enough, my ISP interface shows that all tcp/udp port forwarding requests are the same, even if port 22 works and port 8333 doesn’t.
@_date: 2019-03-13 03:26:17
I already have set redirections from publicIP to privateIP as I had to do it for external SSH to work. So I did it for port 22, 8333 and 9735, but only the SSH rerouting seems to work as even if the Pi is listening to 8333 and advertises its IP,  no inbound peer shows up.
@_date: 2019-03-07 02:50:54
I was thinking that using two 6+ words passphrases, one for the session and one for the wallet, could make it theoretically impossible for them to do anything threatening in the near future.
Then came the RPC situation 
@_date: 2019-03-13 21:30:21
That solved the problem ! I didn't even consider it, thanks a lot. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 13:56:37
Doesn't it also prevent the node from relaying new blocks and transactions ? 
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:12:20
I have no problem doing that, I meant that I don't have any inbound connections.
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:54:06
Yes I'm sure, no problem on the log
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:30:42
Thank you, that was informative!
But isn't Electrum more handy with its HD addresses and Bech32 support ?

I'm planning on setting up a 24/7 Lightning Node. How many btc do you think I should throw in to make it useful and  maybe make a profit ?
