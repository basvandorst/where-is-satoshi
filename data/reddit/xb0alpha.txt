I haven’t the slightest doubt that was in your anus given your manicure and slender, feminine fingers.

Do you really believe it will trade at a higher price? How high?

Do any of you invest in bitcoin?

Your ignorance has nothing to do with anyone else.

I understand our desire for wealth. What I don’t understand is the whole ‘Lambo’ thing.  Is it supposed to be ironic or is it simply saying ‘I’m part of a community which tells its members that if they have success they have to express it in this specific way’?

Comprehension is important; I’d suggest your read my previous post but you’ve provided no evidence that you’ll understand it the second time around.

Wow, he contributed nothing to the economy nor humankind and he’s an insecure, self-congratulatory prick.  Are you sure this is what you really aim to be?

Nah.  My dick is big enough. Don’t need to compensate.

Your ‘maybes’ don’t add-up; so, the whole crypto-culture just all happened to want a ‘Lambo’ since they were kids?  Nearly statically impossible.  I’m starting to think the whole crypto-bro culture is no different than any other subculture these days (e.g. I’m a hipster so I must wear a bushy beard, love craft beer, play the ukulele, and shove gerbils in my ass).  Yes, maybe all hipsters grew-up dreaming of all the same cliches that define them in adulthood.
