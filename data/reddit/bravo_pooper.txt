Of course it works for you. It'll keep working until it doesn't.

That wasn't a comparison.

Yes exactly. You can use that to justify using just about anything. I'm sure some people thought that exact same thing about bitconnect. I'm sure OP thought the exact same thing up until his money disappeared.
So it's not a good reason to use *or* not use coinbase. It's not good reasoning at all. Whereas a huge amount of anecdotal horror stories *is* a good reason to reconsider using coinbase.

i have the exact same issue and i've been stuck for over a month
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:14:03
yeah, this is why there are so many shitcoins. "let's put a blockchain on this idea that totally doesn't need a blockchain and/or token"
it's hype from people who don't understand the tech. or get rich quick scheme.

51% attacks happen within consensus rules. Full nodes do nothing to stop this. This is why it is more important for miners to be decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:16:07
its not exactly censorship, its personalization. for example if google thinks you're left leaning, they will prioritise results that agree with your views.  you end up living in an echo chamber and you don't get a real sense of what's on the internet.
some people also mistake this for censorship because it becomes difficult to find certain types of results.

i was verified, then a few months after i was using bittrex without issues, they freeze my account and ask me to do enhanced verification.

bitcoin also involves many technologies, of which blockchain is only a part of. it also uses cryptography and proof of work. these were all separate existing technologies, bitcoin was unique because it put them together for the first time. without these other components, a blockchain is just an inefficient non distributed database.

they get to invent a token and make some money before they even have a working product
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:21:25
No, you can't opt to ignore their chain. You would need to change consensus rules, which means you need to get everybody else to change their node. If you have to change consensus rules like that, you just invalidated the point of being decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:49:40
seems like a good response from decent people. they're just interested in it, they're not trying to take your money.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:15:47
a centralized blockchain is just a shitty linked list database.
sure you could do it but from a tech perspective it would be retarded
you could implement your example just fine without a blockchain, and without the drawbacks (tx confirmations)... you know, like our existing visa/mastercard payment systems

To go into a bit more detail: 
Bitcoin was a unique combination of several technologies. Blockchain on its own is not very useful. It's a fancy linked list. Combined with proof of work and other tech, it becomes a decentralized currency.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:57:29
You are right that full nodes do contribute to decentralization, but not for the reasons you stated. Nodes with changed consensus rules cannot affect the consensus rules of other nodes. All you need is one honest node as the consensus rules are hard coded into each node and verified locally only.
Here's a quote from the bitcoin docs (


But full nodes still contribute to decentralization because they forward transactions to peers. If the majority of nodes are compromised, valid transactions can be secretly thrown away, or the network can be spammed which does affect the honest nodes.

eh, that's how I pronounce it too
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:44:50
Nodes are vital, but they don't add security. In the short term, nodes will happily accept two competing chains. Hashing power is what keeps the majority chain ahead, and minority chains discarded.
This is why network confirmations are a thing. You are waiting for miners to extend the blockchain. If nodes determined this, then we wouldn't need confirmations.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:08:45
Go read satoshi's paper, it's a short read. This stuff with multiple chains is all literally laid out very clearly. Section 11, page 6: 
And quote from section 5:


extending it.   If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
nodes may receive one or the other first.  In that case, they work on the first one they received,
but **save the other branch in case it becomes longer**.  The tie will be broken when the next proof-
of-work   is   found   and   one   branch   becomes   longer;   the   nodes   that   were   working   on   the   other
branch will then switch to the longer one.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:56:38
We need more nodes for scaling. Security has nothing to do with scaling.
More nodes = better latency, better propagation of transactions, better availability in general. You can't have every miner and wallet connecting to just 2 servers, the servers wouldn't be able to handle it.
Nodes decide which chain to use. But having more nodes doesn't affect any individual node because it is all decentralized. Each node already has the consensus rules built in, and can decide independently which chain to use. When your wallet connects to a node, that's it. It doesn't connect to other nodes. Whether there are 10 or 10000 other nodes in existence doesn't affect you or the node you are connected to.

Which debit card?
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:58:30
Forks happen all the time every day. I'm not talking about UASF or UAHF, I'm talking about two miners independently extending the blockchain. Nodes will accept both chains because they **do** abide by the network rules. This is literally why network confirmations are a thing.
Nodes will hold on to two (or more) chains until one of them is a clear winner. Satoshi goes over this exact scenario in the paper with probabilities of an attacking chain succeeding as the chain grows longer. This is pretty basic bitcoin stuff, you should (re-)read the paper.
You can see a chart of rejected chains here:

First words of section 11:


If I can't convince you with satoshi's words, you are beyond help :)

Don't know if it works with credit card. Paypal for example can only withdraw to debit cards and prepaid cards, not credit cards. Not sure about cex but if it's a card limitation then it will be the same.

What you linked to is talking about providing security for wallets vs using light wallets.
Full nodes do not provide security for the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:13:37
Every time bitcoin comes up in that sub, there's so much stupid shit spouted. "There are no websites that accept bitcoin, you can't convert it back into cash, you can't buy a mansion with it". All blatantly false facts that can be verified easily.
Feel free to debate the merits of bitcoin as a currency (or not as a currency), but for fucks sake, they just stick their head in the sand and slap each other's backs for it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:34:14
No, hashing power is what keeps the network secure. Nodes add availability, not security.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:47:41
Then the network would be broken. I already said, nodes are vital to bitcoin. Having more nodes is a good thing. But not for security reasons, as they don't add security. Nodes are important for other reasons. I already explained my viewpoint.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:04:44
I mean in a blockchain. How do you define what the original branch is? The current bitcoin blockchain is the result of a soft fork from BIP148. BCC is yet another fork. Neither are the 'original'. 'Original' chain is still available but nobody is using it.


So after the fork you have two identical branches. If I showed you two identical branches after a fork, how do you tell which is the original? Hint: you can't. Because they're identical.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:22:25
Bitcoin transaction rate has absolutely no bearing on coinbase as they don't operate on the blockchain except when users move their coins out, at which point coinbase doesn't need to give a shit how long it takes for the transaction to go through.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:11:49
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:47:23
How do you define what the original branch is?
In a distributed system, there is no such thing. [Every working copy in distributed version control is a fork.]( Same as in blockchains.
@_date: 2017-09-21 10:40:25
When a chain splits, both resulting chains are called forks. From a technical perspective, both chains are equal forks. It says nothing about which is the 'primary' chain or 'original' chain, that is something decided by *social* consensus *after* the split and is also a subjective issue.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:11:43
You are using github. Github is a centralised authority who determines which is the original. This doesn't exist in a decentralised system.
