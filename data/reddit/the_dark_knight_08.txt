That isn't stated anywhere nor implied

BTW, when is the 'brief, healthy correction' going to end? It's been two months now
@_date: 2014-02-02 09:11:46
I have no interest in betting, especially not monopoly money
The prediction will show itself to be true
Note that I made that prediction was far higher than where it's at now, and in the 2 months since it still stands and is underway as we speak (halfway down/complete!)

Where's the dot representing when the price went down to under 1 cent on MtGox in mid 2011?
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:06:49


Who's to say that? I'm not saying it's possible to create what I describe, but I see it as the only way it must be, if it is to be at all


also when I say 'currency' I don't mean 'store of value', they are two different things. In fact, I think Bitcoin, and indeed the idea of cryptocurrency works better (or can only work as) solely as a medium of exchange than as a store of value.

Nope, the reason it's dead is because the relief of the 'Chinese burden' as I will call it, has not done anything to help the price, thus the downtrend and bubble-pop continues.
The reason I ask about the two months does not concern Bitcoin's death, but rather the lie that the people here were regularly told - that the crash from $1242 to $805 would only be a 'brief' 'correction', neither of which were true descriptions of course. Many were also convinced, and told to believe, that the return to $1240 shortly afterwards indicated a 'return to normal' - well, wasn't it that indeed, but not in the sense believed at the time.

Get a load of this goy
Thinks deflation is good.. check out the Great Depression will ya!
Not only that, but Bitcoin is INFLATIONARY!!!! For the next 40 or so years, until block rewards come to an end
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:07:25


Who gives a shit what caused it? That's irrelevant to this
The reason why the Great Depression was a bad time to live in was BECAUSE OF deflation.

Irrelevant and off-topic
OP's pic is about market capitalization in dollars, not capitalization in Bitcoins - and you only get dollars through exchanges, so OP's pic is based on exchange transactions, NOT transactions within the Bitcoin protocol. My comment is that the time at which it reached less than a cent should be included as a data point.
Get it?

Actually Ripple tried to attempt that, and that got me interested in it initially (this was about a year ago, I started looking into it when it had just started it's latest incarnation). Problem is, Ripple itself is centralized!
That said, I think in the future we will see something closer to this come into being. This is why I do not say that cryptocurrencies are doomed, but Bitcoin certainly is. It's a bit like pointing out you don't believe in 'God', as in the Abrahamic God, but you leave the possibility of some kind of 'deity' open for speculation.


I think it's probable it has to, and that it can.


What counts as 'decentralized exchanges' exactly? As I hinted at, there shouldn't be exchanges at all - for being able to convert to fiat does harm in a number of ways: It encourages speculation, and it encourages it to be treated as an investable commodity rather than as a currency.
@_date: 2014-01-31 14:15:56
Not immediate death, but a slow death
Confidence could be lost for one of many reasons, or a combination of them
Here are a few: Price is in decline, volatility is not decreasing as hoped/expected, exchanges and individuals are getting regulated/arrested, alternatives (altcoins) are appearing that can do the same job or better, exchanges are shown to be as corrupt/incompetent as they ever were or becoming worse, problems of centralization more broadly speaking, people aren't actually using Bitcoins as a currency for the most part (but as an 'investment'/commodity), etc.

In other words, you know I'm right and don't dare disagree - it was as real a transaction as any other transaction on an exchange

The death is reflected in the price
January 31st gave a final chance; a very minor chance I'll grant you, but it was its last and only one.

And do you know why people didn't have jobs? Because the employers had no money to pay them, because of deflation.
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:09:53


No bro, they were as real as any transaction that happens on any exchange today


"Why are you laughing at me?"
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:44:11


Yes, but that has nothing to do with China


What else would you expect it to do? Fall even further?
@_date: 2014-01-31 14:24:05
I'll restate: The cause is irrelevant, what I've stated is that deflation is bad, regardless of what causes it.

The *fate* of Bitcoin will be pronounced as death, not 'Bitcoin is as of now, dead'.
I disagree with you that 'almost all of them have a really good outlook' - in fact, I'd say it's the other way round. In particular, the issue of having exchanges (which is tied to/is the cause of many other problems). 
Bitcoin is a failure in my view for a few reasons, but one of the most prominent ones has to be that it requires external, centralized exchanges simply because there is no other choice - I mean, what are you going to do, buy a KNC Juniper? This raises yet another related problem - that the ordinary person cannot get Bitcoin, and to get Bitcoin they have to buy from centrally-controlled mining companies, or otherwise the centralized exchanges, *and* it also brings in the issue of fiat convertibility which another downside (i.e.  encourages speculation, unfair wealth transfer/distribution)
Perhaps Bitcoin was never designed with the intention of having such large aspirations for itself, but if it is indeed to be used a serious currency, then it should have somehow make this reliance upon external centralization unnecessary and act as a deterrent against it.

Real Bitcoin transactions were made nonetheless at amounts of less than a cent, so yes, it did really go down.
MtGox chose to sacrifice it's own money to reverse trades and repay users who had lost money - which you'll note is direct market intervention and manipulation, one of the reasons why Bitcoin has been known as a laughing stock for years now.

That would speed death, but death will come when confidence is lost in Bitcoin completely.


My point is that the word 'correction' was used to dissuade fear, and reinforce hope for the price to quickly reach new highs again. People refused to call it a 'crash' (which it has turned out be), and specifically insisted on the word 'correction'. If the word was meant in the way in which you used it, what was all the fuss about?
People also called it 'brief'; 'a rare opportunity'; 'Finally, a great chance to buy up!!!' - as though this period of low prices would quickly come to an end. Well, if you bought about two months ago, even at the lowest ebb of that first wave down ($805), you'd be just be about losing money right now - plus you would've missed the 'rare opportunity' and 'great chance to buy up' at ~$400, a third of the original price.

Read the OP's title, it says 'Deflation is actually good!'
That is what I'm addressing and refuting
I am not entering into a discussion about the cause of deflation, as it is irrelevant in this case and so there is no need to.
But to humor you, if I did follow your line of reasoning, wouldn't I have to then say 'Bitcoin causes deflation, and therefore Bitcoin needs to be fixed/end'?
