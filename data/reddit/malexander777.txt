Better yet, memorize the seed and PIN and store them nowhere. I'm still working on this. If you have a significant amount, own a gun.

It's not marketing when the vast majority have no clue that 666 is encoded on it. And I suppose the Google Chrome logo encoding 666 is also just clever marketing? Consider that maybe Satanism/Luciferianism is very real, and practiced widely by very powerful/influential people.

For the love of God, don't tell her! She eventually will leave your ass and take half. Pretty much guarenteed. It's harsh, it's sad, but that's reality.  AWALT.

Friends? I must be doing it wrong. All I ever got was laughed at and mocked. But they sure aren't laughing now ��

Keep Trezor well hidden, use a good PIN, own a gun.

I agree, we may hurt the feelings of shitcoin hodlers. Just imagine if YOU were heavily invested in shitcoins, and bitcoin just kept rising and getting all the attention while your shitcoins are largely ignored. We need to stop shitting on the shitcoins.

Lol, why do all the men on this show act like emasculated children? Even the way they dress. Never watched it, but whenever I see a clip I notice this. Social engineering I suppose.

I'm well aware that it's a shitcoin with no real future. But I was curious whether the difficulty adjustment could be used for a successful attack on bitcoin.

I must be the only one who has no idea who the character in this meme is. Guess I'll just vote it up anyway ��

I got a bunch of BCH for free and did a small test transaction (.1 BCH for something like .01 BTC). Put it in about an hour ago. Sent the BCH using Trezor with fee setting set to High. Changelly status still shows as "waiting for your payment".

Plot twist: there are already many cures for cancer but they are suppressed because cancer "treatment" and "research" are too profitable.

I'm like 70% in bitcoin, 1% litecoin, 10% shitcoins (because of forks), 10% gold, 2% silver, the rest in Federal Reserve Notes. Yolo.

Don't be so gullible. There is this thing called deception. Another thing called CGI.  There is no Tesla in space! 
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:40:23
Haha, just temind yourself that Federal Reserve Notes are just as risky, without the potential upside.

YOLO. Haters gonna hate!

This is me, at least on the inside, after telling co-workers about bitcoin 4-5 years ago, and stopping all contributions to my 401K scam, and just getting mocked as the crackpot conspiracy guy. I no longer mention it. All I can say is, they're not laughing anymore. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink!

I've got 2 of the 100 trillion dollar ones. Bought them back around 2008 for a few bucks on Amazon. Now they're going for at least $50+.

I had the same problem. There's an option to allow manual entry of fees. It's off by default so enable it in settings.

No one gets out of here alive anyway. I'm like 60% in, which is still pretty crazy.
