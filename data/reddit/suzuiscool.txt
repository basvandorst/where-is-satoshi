Don't try to understand, he posts on t_d, Trump could shit himself and it'd be Obama's fault to these people.

The bitcoin gold fork isn't the contentious one. It has what's called replay protection built in and won't affect the main bitcoin chain. The worrying one is called segwit2x and is planned for mid November. You're safe to move you btc around until shortly before then, after that you should hodl until things clear up.

I'm not 100% sure but from the way they were advertising gold, the actual fork will happen on October 25th, and that should be when the bitcoins are actually copied. Don't quote me on this as I'm only going by what been posted before on this subreddit. Most focus has been on b2x so haven't heard alot about gold.

I was mistaken, thank you. From that it seems it is planned but not yet implemented.

Quadrigacx does, they're based out of Vancouver and I see them recommended fairly often for us Canadians. Haven't used them myself however so ymmv
