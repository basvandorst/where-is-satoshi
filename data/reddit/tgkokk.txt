Well, that destroys Bitcoin's anonymity. Now, you know who send you those 10 BTC.

**THE** Bitcoin. AGAIN!

Works on Nexus 7, 4.2.2, Firefox Beta. Maybe you should use Firefox (Beta)?

On Nexus 7, 4.2.2 (latest version) and I can't see it either.

Looks great! I'll give feedback shortly!

And [this]( is a Bitcoin wallet on Android **that resides on your own device**. It is open source and "endorsed" by bitcoin.org (i.e. shown on their download page).

Good for you. I also try to win BTC with Satoshi, but always end up losing. :(

Did you just tip 1 BTC!? That's an expensive beer.

I suppose you mean [bitaddress.org]( Well, [the source code of the website is available]( If there was a backdoor in the website that allowed the owner to intercept the public/private keys, I guess it would've been found already. Nevertheless, if you're really paranoid, a Linux Live CD with networking disabled should be enough IMHO.

I was just posting the link for others to download the app. It's great that you have contributed to the wallet app. I'd love to know what the feature was, as I'm making my first steps in Android programming and, the app being open source, it's great to look at others' code.

Reddit and Bitcoin make a freako-fucking awesome pair.
