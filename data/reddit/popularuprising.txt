Yeah. Who needs the ability to defend themselves or their families? They should just comply with criminals and hope for the best. It's fucking nutty to want to be able to take action while you're waiting 10-20 minutes for the cops to show up. After all, a nice rapist/robber/mugger might get hurt!

I became happy when I stopped having to worry about every purchase and living paycheck to paycheck. That was at about $85K household income. Now that we're at $120+, I can't say that I'm happier, we just have the ability to purchase higher quality things without having to scrimp and save for them. The major difference between the two income levels for us is that we can donate and give stuff away without wondering how we're going to handle the "loss".

Please learn something about Somalia so that you know what you're talking about.

Corporations that act without government support do not have the power to use violence and force on people. Governments do.

I certainly wasn't intending to insult you. I agree with your sentiment. While I know that you don't need strangers to agree with you, I do anyway. Take that whichever way you want to. 
"being a well-balanced adult" may be a euphemism, but I find it an apt one. I don't share your disdain for them. I find them useful. 
Edit: To e clear: I like the fact that you are direct and don't mince words. It's one of the things that I really appreciate about your posts. However, I don't think that it's the only way to get your point across and it's not always the most effective way to get others to consider your position. I think that we need both approaches in order to convince different subsets of the population. 
But hey, it's just my opinion man.

Everything in North Korea is regulated with an iron hand by the government through the use of laws. In case you missed it, the government is the entity passing and enforcing those rules that are causing mass starvation and poverty in North Korea. This is "rule of law" writ large. 
Also, everything the USSR did was lawful. The government literally passed every law that was used to kill its own citizens.

I call this "being a well-balanced adult". As long as you are willing to consider other opinions and look at your own opinions critically when challenged by a well-reasoned argument, this it the most healthy and mature mental state to have.
