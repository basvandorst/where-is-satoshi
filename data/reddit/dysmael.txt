Fortunately transactions cost nowhere near $20. Where did you get that figure? Coinbase transactions? Or some other exchange that charges too much ? My BTC transfers get confirmed within the hour and cost about $4

5 times bounce makes it weak, not strong. Descending triangle is perfect yes, but those break down 75% of the time

Of course! Isn't everything insider trading?
Just bigger positions than you

Does anyone realize that these types of people are publicly trying to shill their own holdings? 
If I predicted a higher price I would not be broadcasting that info. 
If I had bags to sell because my numbers are in the red I would go public and try to convince the rest of the world to start buying my bags. 
Dead simple. I think it's unethical and believe we will see many new bagholders if people really believe this bulltrap.

That was not Silk road, its a MtGox wallet, because the claimants are getting back their btc.

He'll be back on CNBC Oct/Nov to proclaim BTC might go up to $6K by the end of the year.

sigh... stop overthinking things
Goldman is just some shit cnbc thought maybe be correlated. Drop was very much expected, don't blame others with larger holdings, it was take profit from the move up that started aug 25th, just when bithump promo also started. It's just someone with more money than you
You sell for profit as well right? Don't be pissed a bigger account beat you to it.

And you CPU mined BTC in 2009 ? Or bought ETH for $ 0.40 ?
Better late than never.

1) no-one is buying because there is no reason to buy and anyone willing to buy that could make a difference (retail masses) have already bought between $2K and $19K
2) Lots are selling because of many reasons; the biggest reason being all those millions of dollars people gave to ICO's. They need to liquidate in order to pay bills and to solidify their gains
2a) Many people put in much more than they could afford in Bitcoin, probably taking loans, charging credit cards etc. They cannot hold their breath for very long because debtors are knocking on their doors. They should be very willing to sell for 50% or more losses just to pay back the interest they owe on their credit.

yes, currently I believe no-one is left to buy. 
I believe the main driver last year was the ICO craze.
So you buy BTC/ETH with FIAT, that drives the price up, then you buy Alts / ICO with BTC/ETH which drives alts up. 
This heavily inflates the BTC/ETH price because buying Alts with BTC/ETH does not lower the BTC/ETH-FIAT price
I believe there are still many millions in ICO funds left to be sold.
So a huge selling pressure, with not enough buying pressure.

But if you offered me the choice between $1 and a Pinball machine worth $5400 I'd choose the Pinball machine. Even though it's probably big and heavy and you are right, I don't personally care about Pinball machines. I would instantly sell it. But I'd still go for the thing that has more value.  
If the question was ; do you want $10 in dollars or $10 worth of Bitcoin I would understand people choosing the dollars.
