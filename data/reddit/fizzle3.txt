I am not really sure if a currency needs advertisement. Or should use advertisement.

I am more concerned about the content of that webpage, to be honest.


What is this? A webpage for users in 1991?

Well, that is a new thing. Can a moderator edit the address out and then ban the user? This is fun.

To the people in this thread who do not use yet: You may be able to go the the subreddit and redeem some of your karma for a small amount of BTC. Yes, that means karma is finally worth something.

I think in the long run, BTC banks will pop up to "guarantee" the same amount of reversibility than current banks. And make your wallet less prone to stupidity.

There are so called "BTC mixing services". And to be honest: These are basically money laundries. The obscure the origin of BTC by throwing many BTC in one pot and directing them to sources of their owners choice, thus making it harder to track them.
By using enough mixing services it can be very hard to tell where a BTC came from.
Then again, there is always the cash option. But as with fiat currencies, that does not scale very well.

Absolutely not safe. The RFID variant can be read from quite a distance. The magnet variant is not much better.
And if you protect the data with a password, like your bank card, you have a security problem on the card reading machine/the keyboard.

Tip: Just don't. Not worth the electricity. Cheaper to just buy BTC, even with the current price.
