$50 worth in 2017? just give her the $25 its worth today and consider that fee a lesson learned not to keep any coins where you dont control the key.

if you doubt anything, dont use.
return and buy from co.
you'll always question authenticity and that completely negates the whole idea behind a hardware wallet.

regardless...enjoy...but stop giving bad advice.

I confirmed with my bank that they would have no issue at all with any amt deposited from a crypto exchange (wells fargo)
they only mentioned anything over 10k will be reported to IRS- from there it's your responsibility.

400/11200(price of btc)=0.035btc
100000(goal)*0.035=3500 
you'd have 3500

what's disconnecting from the internet gonna do? if you have malware taking screenshots they're being saved on the machine and can resume upload as soon as its plugged back in.
unless you plan on keeping the machine offline, i wouldn't use a paper wallet.

don't trade this market. invest in it.

people had trouble after the price came back down, and miners all switched over to BCH scam coin.
hopefully they learned a lesson after that tanked.

gold isn't even money now. id ask him to go try and pay his groceries in gold and lets see how it goes.
lets see him take a brick in, shave down his estimations based on current market prices, bring in a scale, and see how the retailer reacts.
gold is a paperweight at this pt.

take a break- stop looking at the price and stop watching every single movement. 
easier said than done, I know...but this entire space is for long term, not short.

then you can be that hero and stand up to them.

whats the point exactly?  if they can't get any information from a wallet address whats it matter if coins can be traced? traced to what exactly?
@_date: 2019-06-11 01:27:05
you sound like a scammer yourself. gtfo.

because most people aren't willing to go to jail over a fucking digital asset.
lambos dont drive too well behind prison walls.

yah i guess that's the interesting part. it seems like everyone's okay with it as long as they're towards the upper tier.

what "valuable shit" are early adopters doing other than holding and hoping it rises to 100/200/400k?
that seems to be the mentality of many in the space, which leaves a massive gap for others in the futute on the other end of that insight.
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:18:46
gold or fiat never has the expectation of rising 50x inside of 2-5 years.
it's not the rise that's the issue I'm mentioning, it's the exponential rise in the short timeframe that sparks the massive gap.
again, don't have the answers- just making note that it makes things great for a few, but really bad for many.

you mean like government printing notes then investing those notes in their own bonds/treasuries and most recently ETFs to falsely prop up a market? wait that's not btc.
