Yeah, but are they actually going to do anything about it?
And there was almost no market reaction for a few days after trump's tweet. It was only trump's opinion, he said, "I'm not a fan". Also, I don't think most people expect a 70 something year old like Trump to understand how cryptocurrency / blockchain works.

Free to move and the fees are cheaper on coinbase pro. The thing is it takes about 5 days to deposit USD onto coinbase pro. If you buy on coinbase and transfer, you still have to wait about 5 days for the purchase to clear before it will let you transfer from coinbase to coinbase pro. 
If you're selling, I don't see why people don't just transfer their crypto to coinbase pro instantly and sell on there for less fees.

If it passes the "government test" and gets adopted by fidelity, bakkt, td ameritrade, and etrade, that would be huge. Along with the exposure it is currently getting.
BTC may be about to drop dramatically or reach its maturity as a legitimate asset. We will find out over the next 3 to 12 months.

It's useful, but it is only one of many things to take into consideration. Some of the patterns in and of themselves can seem ridiculous though, such as the double-inverted head-and-shoulders upside-down drinking with cup-and-handle water-flowing downward pattern.
Basically, if you zoom out to the monthly chart and a vague depiction of the mona lisa is formed - that's a buy signal.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:17:08
This is one of the few times that I might actually buy the dip. It's getting to the point where it's a no-brainer, like the 3.5k mark in early 2019.
@_date: 2019-07-18 13:22:37
Cringe to assess the fundamentals of an asset after a major price change? Good luck trading, dumbass!
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:45:24
These problems have been around forever, and now people are changing their minds? Lol. Sound like FUD to me.

Lot of bullish news and halving getting priced in. Don't feel like listing out all of the news events, because there were many, but they have significantly improved the fundamentals of BTC. At 3.5k - 4k it was also very oversold, so there was a lot of incentive for accumulation around those price points. BTC was valued at about 4k, but its real value was probably more like 9k, so people started buying.
Of course it over-shot to 14k over a few months because of FOMO and greed. 10k was a big psychological resistance line that was broken through quickly. Now we're seeing the unearned value be shaved off as the price consolidates around 9k - 10k.
My guess is this pullback is caused by btc being over-bought, negative sentiment caused by Libra-related news, whales dumping to buy back lower, and a chain reaction of weak hands selling. Also Binance recently opened margin trading which opens up short selling to a lot of people that only had the buy option previously, which would increase sell pressure compared to previous trading patterns. Not only that, but they can do it in larger amounts because of leverage.
We are getting low on the RSI, and 9600 and 9000 are the next major support levels. It would be abnormal and strongly bearish for us to break below the 9k level during this pullback. Bakkt planned on announcing the start of user acceptance testing on July 22nd, so it will be interesting to see if that has any effect on price. People might start accumulating in anticipation of Bakkt's official opening (after testing).
@_date: 2019-07-10 19:54:03
Exactly. Right now we got a lot of speculative and greed pumps which create weak support lines and increased volatility. 
Expecting some organic and more sustained growth around the corner with the release of bakkt, fidelity opening bitcoin trading for institutional investors, and potentially later down the line - erisx opening bitcoin futures trading and Etrade starting crypto trading, and nasdaq releasing bitcoin futures.
@_date: 2019-07-18 06:38:54
Just broke 10k again! lol
@_date: 2019-07-15 04:36:54
Right, I'm just guessing and its just my opinion. Either way 14k was too much too fast and a correction was highly likely to happen. I think the bullish trend will continue, we're just seeing a huge pullback right now. The RSI was way too high and now it's balancing out.
@_date: 2019-07-25 14:58:01
Volatility is volatility. I never said there was no reason for the drop. Most of the time there is a reason for BTC price drops as well.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:42:23
Its totally possible this guy is really good at predicting and the remaining predictions will come true. I just take it with a grain of salt because there isn't much info presented to back the predictions. 
Best of luck to you all, this is a crazy market.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:30:04
Still just a chain reaction of FUD. I'm wondering if the fundamentals of the asset have actually changed. I guess it is all sentiment. The US Govt., from what I can tell, has not actually said they are going to put any sanctions on BTC or ban it in the country. Trump gave his opinion on BTC it because FB's Libra coin was causing issues. 
The Fed reserve, congress, treasury, etc... they all said mostly neutral or good things about BTC. The only negative was that people use it for illegal payments and potentially money laundering, but the conclusion there was it needs more regulation, nobody ever said they were going to ban it. 
Looks like the takeaway is that the govt. reluctantly accepts BTC, and some even endorse it. Where as they are very skeptical of FB's crypto and are trying to prevent it from getting anywhere. If anything this is bullish for BTC long-term, because it is further validation and has shown that it has been tested under scrutiny by the US govt and it passed.

So far they've gotten April 2019 right and July 2019 very close to right (most of July thus far has been above 10,000). 
Out of all the people posting predictions, a few of them, by chance, are inevitably going to be correct. Retrospectively we pick these out and say "wow, this is spot on" ignoring the 100 other predictions that were incorrect. 
Let's see how the remaining 4 predictions this person made turn out. I am also bullish on bitcoin for the next 3 to 12 months, but for other reasons.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:14:32
Over-bought argument is good for about a 20% - 30% correction, but we are really low on the RSI right now and it's still dropping. Also, I think the fundamentals have improved over 2018 and at 3.5k it was significantly oversold. A lot of the growth in 2019 was for legitimate reasons, though 13.8k was too much too fast.
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:33:23
Lol it might actually follow the top part of the drawing.
@_date: 2019-07-25 14:59:42
They're both assets with comparable levels of volatility, like many other stocks such as penny stocks. Very few people use bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:35:05
I am a software developer and it took me quite a while to fully wrap my head around how blockchain / crypto works and why it is legitimate and not just "thin air". Maybe Trump could get someone who is good at explaining cutting edge digital technology with complexity to a 70 something boomer who isn't tech savvy and set in the ways of traditional finance.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:53:36
Hope so. I'm not holding, but I want the market to move up by EOY so I can actually make something.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:52:08
Ok, but wouldn't that be a more gradual drop as the interest goes down? This happened in less than an hour...
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:28:23
There was a 15k BTC transfer on the ledger around the time it happened yesterday, not sure if it is related.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:20:36
why is it dipping?
@_date: 2019-06-16 20:28:25
Yeah, but look at the long-term trend. Check the weekly and monthly charts. 
Back in 2017 when the bullish trend kicked in the day to day prices got a lot more volatile. Its all the short term traders buying and taking profits off of the major price movements.
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:17:25
Right, there may be a delay, but if the price difference between retail and OTC is great enough, people will arbitrage between the two for an easy profit.
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:16:36
I didn't think the volume would surge on the first day. It's not a financial product for the masses like an etf would be. It is mostly geared toward institutions which are slow to act, and do so in a calculated way. Only certain people can access or will make the effort to access the futures contracts. Most institutional investors probably haven't even heard the news about bakkt's launch yet. I think it would be fair to evaluate bakkt based on its performance over the next year, not the first few days.
 Also, this has been anticipated for a while so it is already mostly priced in. Any increase from here would be due to the actual performance of bakkt and not people speculating based on bullish news.
