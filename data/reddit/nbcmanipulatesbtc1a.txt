we are oversold.  everyone who is "really in" just went in.  coinbase just opened "instant buy" which actually works pretty damn well as advertised. this is a new money thing...and that will take a few days.  i am not new.  this is just btc.  new high is met with a 30% dip 100% of the time.  these are facts.  new buyers will panic sell and older money is maxed.  news says buy buy buy.   that is when you sell

ohhh...maybe I should delete it then?  
theoretically speaking (obviously cuz clearly I am full of sheet) if one had a stash and hodl'd/accumulated from 2013-2017, would it not behove that person to move out cash slow and low under the 20k reporting requirements of exchanges?  enlighten me?  what would you be doing?
