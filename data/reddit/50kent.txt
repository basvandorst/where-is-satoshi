I would contact relevant magazines/websites (Reason magazine comes to mind in the US) and see if any of them would be interested in publishing anything about that from you. You’d probably have to translate it into English and possibly give a summary of the article if you’re going after US publications, but I’m sure there’re some domestic media companies you could contact

Hey newb question here but I’m panicking a little. I bought some btc in Coinbase the other day. It became available today, so I opened my electrum wallet (on a desktop computer), scanned the QR receiving address (using the Coinbase app on my phone), and sent it. Normally within 30 seconds or so electrum would show me the pending incoming coin, but I’m not seeing that now. Coinbase still says Pending like it normally would, but did I make some dumb mistake? Or am I just panicking over nothing? Thanks

OH no instant buys? That makes a little sense. Thanks

I have a few questions about fees (particularly regarding Coinbase and Electrum) and how to get the best bang for my buck now that I live near ATMs. Although I'm not exactly new to BTC, I definitely do not have a good understanding of even some more basic concepts, so if I'm fundamentally misunderstanding something I'd appreciate a correction! I usually buy $50-$250 in BTC at a time by the way. 
**How do I instantly buy BTC for the best value possible?** In the past I have mostly bought from Coinbase, using their debit/instant feature for 4%+ miner fee, once I transfer my balance from Coinbase to my Personal Electrum Wallet. Is there a more economical way for me to use a debit card/bank account buy BTC instantly?
I've also just moved to an area with BTC ATMs. Just saw my first one the other day. Seems like fees in town run from 6.9%-~12% based on what's published. **Could buying from one of these ATM's be a better deal than staying online?** 
I currently use Electrum Wallet, and have for a few years. Fees have gotten very high though if I want any kind of reasonable transaction time. I just got a new computer and moved to a new town, so I am not opposed to looking into more Windows-based wallet options. **What wallet(s) would you recommend to me, taking into account security, fees, and other factors I may not be considering?**
I am also interested in getting a secure wallet for my iPhone. Other than the Coinbase app I've never really used a mobile (iOS in this case) wallet. **What mobile wallet(s) would you recommend?**
Thank you for any info provided! Yeah I just recently learned why miner fees effect the time of the transaction so a lot of this is still super new to me.

What're the benefits of transferring to another market wallet like that instead of one of your own?

ah just checked it out, I assumed it was a paid service being 'pro', I'll definitely start using this thanks!

Honestly not sure if it's still an issue right now, just as of maybe two or three months ago Chase told me they refused to let me make transactions with you guys with my credit card and the rude customer service phone rep implied my contract would probably be cancelled if I kept trying.
I've had great experience with you guys in the past, but instant transactions are relatively important to me (or at least same day, bank transfer is usually less desirable) which I why I switched to circle for a bit.
After this headache though I will be looking into alternatives, and if coinbase looks promising you will be the first on my list. Thanks so much for the information!

Yeah ugh. And locally the only options either seem super sketchy or are at like $50+ reasonable market rate 
@_date: 2016-10-27 21:19:36
Thank you for the suggestion! Not sure if this is the best primary solution for me but I'll look into it for a secondary option for sure!

In most countries in the world (all common-law countries) unjust enrichment is illegal. The hard part with BTC is proving who erroneously received the funds, not making them pay it back

Yeah we can just keep a few fiat bills for reasons like this lmao
