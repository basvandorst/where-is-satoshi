It may be what you say it is, but it may not. Peer review is non existent, but even that aside SegWit2x has been "agreed" by minority (without a doubt a very influential minority) behind closed doors by signing a piece of paper. Imagine the precedent this establishes, when a small, yet very powerful actors can interact and steer bitcoins protocol development as they please. 
This is not why I fell in love with bitcoin and I do not agree with this. 
My 3 satoshis.

No SegWit is better than SegWit2x tho.

Oh, hi. I thought you're above replying to redditors with 3 months old account. I'm glad it's not the case. 
Anyway,  sorry for being passive-aggressive. 
Open source code != Open development. 
The code may indeed be open, but any input, review, comment or suggestion may be (already has been) deleted (cenzored) in SegWit2x repo. 
I'm completely okay with people using different clients. In fact I believe it's a desired outcome for bitcoin overall for it to remain permissionless in terms of innovation. 
SegWit2x client is not being made with that spirit in mind is all.

SegWit2x introduced unprecedented number of attack vectors on bitcoin security. I'd rather avoid that, even if it costs me more to transact with BTC

It is pretty clear what SegWit2x is after revealing it's true development process. Which happens behind closed doors. I mean try to get access to its github, close to impossible. That's not why bitcoin is interesting to me. Quite the opposite.
