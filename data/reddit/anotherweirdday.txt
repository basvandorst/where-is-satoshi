Schon GEZahlt?  
I remember those German TV Tax goons visiting my place when I lived there.  They wanted to come inside and make sure everything was appropriately registered.  I told them I was American and didn't understand what this was about (haha), and after some confused looks and hand waving they left.
They would play those stupid "Schon GEZahlt" ads in the movie theaters before the movies came on.  At least you could order beer and ice cream without getting out of your seat. I miss Lagnese.
Oh and talk about catch-22.  I remember trying to rent an apartment.  I needed a German bank account.  I then went to the bank.  They wanted my German address.  I was able to get a young teller at Deutschebank to skirt the system and use a temporary address of a friend (that I would change later) without providing proof of residence.  I was then able to get my apartment, and register myself at the city.  Then changed my address with Deutschebank.  What a nut roll.
With that said, Germany is definitely far from libertopia.
Oh yeah, you're also taxed on the number of closets you have, which is why you need to buy a wardrobe.

Social security numbers have been enumerated at birth since the mid 80's.  Furthermore, contracts require express consent.  The constitution is not a legal contract, for it is used by some to bind people to it who were unaware of its existence, as well as the unborn, in perpetuity.  I know of no contract vehicle in existence that allows me to bind my neighbors to it without their knowledge, let alone future generations.

Right and it's caveat emptor.  Government is the last entity i would want to protect consumers- I prefer insurance companies because they can compete with each other.  They can provide checks and balances in a more responsive way than these fuddie duddies in NY government.

Typical response from a socialist
@_date: 2014-06-12 10:40:41
The primary reason for inflation is that the treasury through taxes can never repay the principal in dollars.  Even by fighting wars and harvesting resources from other countries- these must get converted back into dollars (albeit stronger dollars) at some point, which are then taxed and the principal is still never repaid.  Even a commodities backed system would suffer the problem as long as a central bank is collecting interest- and it did.  The fed's board is suspected to be composed of the usual rothschilds, warburgs, loebs, and European nobility

It is a blatant attempt to quell skepticism and to have a rational discussion.  People who are unsure about the issue but trust the regulators are inclined to agree for two reasons-- first to save face and avoid embarrassment for not fully understanding the issue, and second to avoid having to expend the effort to learn.

LOL it's clear that you and/or your agency does not understand bitcoin.  Trifle.
The state cannot protect consumers from bitcoin fraud.  If you REALLY want to help, you can try to develop an escrow service for the blockchain, but that's not your intent is it?
Leave bitcoin alone and jail the bankers.

@_date: 2014-02-17 21:12:35
Since we somehow got into a debate of whether or not the state is morally justified...
Here is my response to that.
1. I don't think might makes right.  If you do, then you can justify the democratic election of Hitler all the way down to lynch mobs against blacks in the Southern US.
2. I'm against the initiation of force.  If you are against the initiation of force, then you will allow me to peacefully coexist within the state without having to use or pay for its goods and services (or leave/abandon my property).  You will also allow me to peacefully provide alternatives to the state's goods and services in open and fair competition.
3. I certainly can't give someone rights that I don't have myself, and I wouldn't want to even justify it.  If you think you can and it's justified, then why can't you rob people to get what you want yourself?  What makes electing someone to do it on your behalf moral?

Not entirely-- many of those (US companies I'd assume) were issued FISA letters and were gagged from telling the public. This FISA thing is part of the scandal, and part of the outrage. They don't issue FISA letters to non-US firms obviously.  "Fair game" for traditional espionage targets.

What if some entity mined bitcoins with the intent of hoarding/destroying them?  They're limited, there is a known quantity and so bitcoin's weakness lies in the fact that this resource can be permanently destroyed.  At least with precious metals/minerals the total quantity is unknown and presently undiscoverable..
