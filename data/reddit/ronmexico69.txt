Could someone explain to me what I'm looking at? I get generally, that this guy has a poor understanding of how to put a lock on objects, which can allow multiple transactions to occur if implemented poorly when control switches between threads. I just learned about locks this week, and I've only seen examples related specifically to java. Would there be an obvious fix to his problem? It seems like control is probably switching between threads after he checks if a lock is available. Could his problem be resolved by combining his isfreelock and getlock methods and synchronizing them (or whatever the php equivalent is)? This has become a dumb question at this point. I think mostly I'd like to talk about locking and using multiple threads, as I've got an exam coming up.

But that would do nothing to prevent people from using multiple accounts. a nominal charge would be a better solution imo.

What's the general process for using your service? Also what are the costs associated with it?

I'm sure they are capable of the volume, just not the unexpected flooding of small B.S. transactions.

Everyone in this thread is Captain Hindsight all of a sudden. Things like that slip through the cracks all the time in programs, even with really good programmers. I mean didn't the original mars mission fail because of a failure to convert from imperial to metric? Not a perfect parallel, but I'm just saying, these things happen. If you support an unregulated currency like this, you can't expect perfection. It really just seems like a lot of people are really BITter about losing money because they invested in a volatile currency. I don't blame the people at MtGox. I'm sure it was an honest oversight, and it doesn't make them incompetent. I think what they have accomplished is extremely impressive, if anything.

Why do you say that?
