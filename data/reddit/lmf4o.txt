 Not teally true tbh. Jf you have 20 antminer s9 , your probability - given current difficulty level - to mine at least 1 block within a year is close to 1.
One block is - given current price - and incl fees worth roughly 130k or more!
Given Germanys energy price, you’d make a healthy profit!
But ofc, you could be unlucky and not mine a block at all

Using we is quite common in academic papers. Even on ones with a single author.

Depends on your risk profile I guess

We don’t know that

what are they using now? ZCash? XMR?

I can't fucking wait for it to drop to 10k or lower. Need to get rid of some fiat

I ordered TenX and IMO the nicest thing is that they will support Dash and Ethereum. While I store my savings in BTC, for transactions I'll use an Altcoin.

Probably he should do that... on the other hand. If this is true, he and his family will have a lot less worries

Paying off debt should be your  goal. Seriously. It will make your life so much better!

September 2018 you mean
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:23:44
at least  you tried

and is up again
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:42:18


you probably pay some withdraw fees depending on the exchange. but should be a minor annoyance.

and then the power is in the hands of the network right? With PoS you don't need miners anymore

essentially it's not clear what will happen with my BTC on August 1 right? They code store them in a BIP148 wallet or in a Legacy wallet. 
Did Poloniex or Kraken signal something in that direction?
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:40:33
stupid question. But where would you pay for eggs? In other words, who would take your BTC? Or do you think that people will then alter their business models and switch to BTC as a primary mean for trading?
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:34:38
on Aug 1st, when the BTC guys come to a decision, LTC will skyrocket. I guess thats what he is saying
