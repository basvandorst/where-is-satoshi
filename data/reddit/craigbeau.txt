Make sure you save you 25% for the IRS, they will come a knocking.

Just bought mine, super nervous to set this up and transfer over my coins. Still not as nervous as always being scared of a hack.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:16:24
Yup, ughhhhhhh

Such kind advice from someone with such a scary username. Thanks!

I’m 27 is that young enough? Completed all the paper work today to pull my 401k out and go in on the next dip. I was talked out of buying BTC when it was at $300 by my old roommate. At the time I was going to put around 5K in. Five months ago I finally went in and bought 1 BTC. Ever since I went in I’ve basically made my coinbase wallet my new savings account.  (Beside 2k I keep locked in my safe as an emergency fund.)
I’m “broke’” after paying my bills because I put my self on a $300 spending budget between paychecks and what ever I have left over I buy in BTC. I have developed a case of FOMO due to my past experience missing out at the $300 mark. Anyone I try to get advice from looks at me like I’m crazy so I figured this community could help me out.

What would be the safest and most secure wallet you could use that would be the closet to the functionality of a mainstream bank account?

Love when dips happen on payday!!

I second guess myself because when ever I try to sit down with a financial  advisor or talk about it with others they always steer me in the direction of “Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme”  or some other BS like that.

I’m not broke, credit score is 790. Im just trying my best in this short window to get as many “nuts stashed” as I can before BTC really takes off. Like I said I already have about 1.2 BTC. My bills are always paid, I have rental income ( which goes into an escrow) The $300 budget I put myself on is so I can put more towards BTC while cutting all the fat out of my spending habits.

I rather lock it in a safe 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:20:12
Is there a glitch in the matrix? Haha. Well I hope you can get something out of this post!

Since I bought my house two years ago the value increased 100k, my rental income pays 80% of my mortgage. I make anywhere from 65-100k a year depending how much over time I work.

Just took the most glorious dump watching in go from $9,999.99 to $10,030 now. I can sleep happy.

I believe that BTC has great potential to skyrocket dramatically. I also believe you have to have a goal set and know when to pull out. Don’t get greedy, greed has never lead anyone to a positive place.

Ehhh, I take it you don’t have debt in your life. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:51:03
I needed this in my life a week ago 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:28:18
This ideology of HODL is going to bite a lot of people in the ass a couple years from now 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:53:57
Man, I really need to hop on the GDAX boat. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:26:32
Could be 2 years could be 5 years, also could be tomorrow. The beautiful thing about it is we all will never know when the right time is. That’s why you have to have a personal goal set. Know when enough is enough for yourself, be able to walk away after selling and be happy even it is continues to climb.

Debt is almost entirely unavoidable in the world we live in today. I would like to think I manage it well, my credit cards are high because of a couple emergency expenses associated with my home. Lucky both of my cards are interest  free for the next 12 months so that give me time to get that wiped away. 
As far as the student loans......Fuck Sallie Mae lol.

A decade is a long time to hold on to anything 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:39:11
Please send me one 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:51:52
To be honest with you I think the same thing. I think it has to do more with the credit to debt ration. It’s spread out between two cards and they are both under 20% utilized. Also have a squeaky clean payment history. I got my first CC when I was 18 so I do have one account that has a good length of time attached to it 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:37:39
I’ve never thought of it that way but I love that POV. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:50:29
Only thing that’s makes me feel a little ok.
