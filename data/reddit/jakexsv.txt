Another alternative to purchase BTC!
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:23:29
Open/Login at places such as; MtGox, BitStamp, BTC-e, bitfinex, CampBX.  
  
Search for Deposit options, more than likely you will have a bitcoin address. Then go back onto blockchain, and send BTC to the listed address (your account) on the exchange of your choice.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:58:01
Coinbase makes this process simply.  
* Login  
* Go to account settings  
* Go to Integrations  
* Go to Paper wallet  
* Click generate wallet  
* Print!  
  
Another way, which is probably (a tiny bit) safer, would be create your own wallet on an offline computer &amp; transfer your coins to that offline wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:20:02
Transfer the BTC to an exchange, and sell it for FIAT.

My current perspective on the situation is, I think its quite hard to buy BTC right now. With no exchanges having bank deposits (U.S.), and coinbase being delayed, its making the market have a lot more sellers than buyers.

This question is better suited for Also, never trust ButterflyLabs or their delivery times.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:49:33
I'll explain.  
  
Say you were able to use a credit card to buy bitcoin. So you go to a website/exchange, buy 1BTC for $600 USD using your credit card or paypal. You receive your 1BTC. Then a day later, you go to your credit card company or paypal and say "I didn't make this transaction!". The credit card company/paypal then forcefully takes back the funds from the website/exchange and returns them to you.  
  
It basically would allow for exchanges/websites that sell bitcoins to be screwed over.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:15:46

Maybe when you do an instant verification from coin base, it doesn't physically check your account numbers? And maybe it simply checks if the credentials you provided were valid. Check your bank account, were funds ever taken out by Coinbase? If not, I assume you misspelled something with your routing/account number.  
  
100% guess.

I like the idea; once bit coin becomes a bit more popular. For now, I would *guess* a large portion of the user base is a developer/engineer/designer/etc.

Why would they "make it right"? You sold. The times when Coinbase makes it right..is for example when a transaction is marked high risk and gets cancelled, yet after you email them they oblige to your request and sell you the BTC at the price you requested. Things more of that nature.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:22:13
The supply (amount accessible/available for sale) and the demand (the amount people want to buy) determine the price of BTC.

I believe so (might be a backup payment option only). Upon Validating your bank account, and you identity you can instantly buy BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:29:36
Check out Coinbase's paper wallet exporter. It simply generates a new wallet (public/private key) and allows you to print it out. CoinBase does not store the private key.

The localbitcoin seller will send his BTC to your public/bitcoin address/QR code. I do not believe the seller should have any need to give you an address/QR code/etc.  
  
Warning: I have never used localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:59:12
1) Should you avoid coinbase because wallet is linked to identity?  
-I think this is more of an opinion; I personally use Coinbase's offline paper wallet exporter.  
2) Will the money you put in coinbase increase in value?  
-The money, or FIAT currency you give to coinbase is buying BTC, which could increase, or decrease, in value based on the exchange rate. I believe coinbase uses BitStamp exchange, so the buy and sell prices will be similar.  
3) How do you sell BTC for FIAT?  
-Not sure.

@_date: 2013-11-19 06:00:46
Whether you buy coins on Coinbase or MtGox, they will be stored in a wallet on Coinbase/MtGox. You can then send the BTC from that online wallet, to your own, personal wallet on your computer.  
  
Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:49:03
Keep trying. I'd bet the average attempts per user is around 5 times.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:01:04
In the future please use the subreddit search bar. This has been asked a million times I'm sure.  
  
  
You can register at an exchange, coinbase, or localbitcoins. Not all exchanges have an easy way of depositing FIAT into their account. Most also have a verification process that can take several days.  
  
"Apparently you can't do it with visa or paypal (that's fucking stupid btw)" Please educate yourself. Paypal and credit card systems have the ability to reverse transactions while bitcoin does not. So I'm sure you can figure out why those aren't used.

On November 20th CampBX.com (which is currently undergoing maintenance) is going to add a bank transfer option (ACH) which I believe is similar to coinbase. And it's an exchange.  
  
So I'd suggest CampBX over mtgox.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:55:23
The author is right, credit cards cannot be used. Wire transfers take time.  
  
LocalBitcoins with cash is the fastest option to buy BTC at significant quantities. Coinbase's instant buy feature only allows for 1 BTC per week.
  
I'd say the author is knowledgeable on the subject.

I'm not sure if cancelling your first transaction will suddenly allow you to Instant Buy.

They are processing your request/purchase order. It will take a couple days before money is pulled from your bank.  
  
Unfortunately, you did not read the note stated when buying BTC from coinbase. There is a temporary issue... "Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Friday Nov 22, 2013 at 09:27PM CST after your funds have arrived."  
  
You wouldn't be frustrated if you read what you were doing, or researched how Coinbase works before buying BTC from them.  
  
But don't worry! I believe Coinbase is allowing for users to cancel their buy orders.

So because a *single analyst* says they will go over $1000 USD, that's how you base your financial decisions?  
  
Do you think that analyst might have their own agenda?  
Do you not realize how volatile BTC is? It could be big, it could be $0. We don't know.  
  
These threads are getting a bit repetitive.

Honestly, BTC is extremely volatile, and impossible to predict. No one exactly knows what the future holds. Beware of bad advice!

1) No one here can predict prices and tell you the appropriate time to invest or not.  
2) Coinbase is fine, so are exchanges such as MtGox, CampBX, BitStamp  
3) No one here can predict the future of BTC/USD  
4) Transactions are basically instantaneous at exchanges. Coinbase also offers instant buying after certain verification.  
5) Not enough! :)
