You're also ignoring valid positive points too. Established ecosystem, tons of institutional money involved, established brand.
A new shitcoin could come out that would dwarf bitcoin in all technological aspects and it still may not take off due to not having the traits above.

Institutional money getting involved will stop this from happening. When you have big investment banks making strides into Bitcoin, government's wouldn't dare mess with those sweet, sweet lobbyist dollars.

THose are the two I don't consider shitcoins. Ethereum has great underlying tech as a decentralized cloud computing platform.

I find it interesting that horizontal scaling techniques were never considered in the early stages. This philosophy is a foundational part of scale out infrastructure design in cloud datacenter.

So what is the best course of action then? I currently have my coins sitting on an exchange.

Institutional money is coming in slowly. Smaller independent investment banks are now underwriting bitcoin trusts.  If the investment bankers are getting involved, it’s good for everyone.

There is an exemption of $500,000 for crypto.

I too am interested in this. 
I know the best course of action is to not sell/buy anything until we can see which fork will rank supreme. What will this do to the price? 
Will Electrum recognize the new B2X coins? I thought about moving my B2X coins to a separate wallet after the fork but that puts me at extreme risk.

The latter.  There are some bitcoin trusts buying bitcoin but these etfs will be funds of publicly traded blockchain companies.
