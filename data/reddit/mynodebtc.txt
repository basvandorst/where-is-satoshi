Is it a Raspi 3? You can try running a myNode image which will give you Bitcoin, LND, a couple Lightning wallets, and the ability to run an electrum server.
250 GB is getting really close to the limit. 500GB should work, but myNode requires 1TB+ for the additional features like QuickSync and the Electrum Server. Also, I'd recommend an external HDD rather than an SSD. I've seen quite a few issues where during high write loads the raspi cannot power the drive properly and hangs. Never seen this with an HDD. A powered USB3 hub may resolve that though.

Lightning can run on a pruned node, but you at least need the history of the blockchain since LN channels started appearing. Routing does not work very well without a decently long history.

I think that's arguable either way. A pruned node has validated all the blocks, but has lost the history.
For example, layer 2 protocols, like the lightning network, work best working with a node that has kept the history so it can properly understand the state of the network. Otherwise, routing has a tendency to fail. It can work with a pruned node, but it needs to have all the history after the first LN channels were made about 1.5 years ago.
My preference is to use something like a myNode device that has a complete full node. It can support all other Bitcoin software, like LND, light wallets, Lightning phone apps, etc...

A little background - to keep prices lower we provide a disk-less version of a myNode since many people have a spare 1 TB+ external HD for use or can find one inexpensively online. This keeps costs low, but means there must be an initial blockchain sync with the network. This can take a very long time, especially on small, low powered hardware.
QuickSync is a way for myNode devices to download a pre-validated copy of the blockchain to avoid the 1-2 month initial sync time. This reduces this time to 1-2 days instead.
myNode devices will all participate in QuickSync, which allows them to share the pre-validated initial state.
Every user also has the option to individually validate their copy of the blockchain as well, but that will take a while.

Thanks for all the PMs! I will be getting back to people tonight after I get the latest version uploaded.
@_date: 2019-06-06 23:59:36
Good point! We'll look into adding an easy mode.
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:26:35
It's likely we will be open sourcing the UI orchestration software, but we haven't worked out the details yet.
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:29:09
Those are great points! I completely agree and that's what myNode is attempting to provide long term. It should be easy for user's to run their own node to trustlessly use Bitcoin and Lightning.
Look at  [  for points  and  It looks like great software to help with the payments and storefront side of things. We're looking at adding it in future version of myNode.

To clarify, disk-less means that is just does not have the external 1TB HD. It will comes with the Micro SD card and all the software.

It's probably possible, but it will be very slow, especially if it ever needs to "catch up". It's running a pruned node, so it doesn't keep a full copy of the Blockchain.

It depends on the hardware. In my experience, a Raspberry Pi running a number of applications, including bitcoind, and saving data to an external HD via USB 2.0 can take over a month to fully sync from scratch. Granted, I gave up after about a week (block \~380,000) and copied a pre-validated copy of the blockchain which only took a couple hours.
