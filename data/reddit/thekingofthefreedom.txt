@_date: 2019-03-31 03:29:49
that's true he was right about 2017 but actually it got higher than 10k, about 20k... So it may get 200k instead of 100k...

@_date: 2018-10-20 03:24:14

@_date: 2018-10-20 10:24:19
What do you mean "regular investor who dont know what are doing"?

That's a problem, but the real treat is right beside us, exchanges.. They have too much personal information. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 13:28:49
Very interesting, but what can guarantee me that if one day bitcoin reach moon this Wasabi company wont steal my bitcoins somehow?  
@_date: 2019-02-23 12:44:34
Interesting. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 07:38:23
I'm not even living in brazil, I  wonder where all this sherlock holmes which this impressive detective skills is coming from, damn. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 12:45:41
Damn, that shows how big this beast can go.. And ppls dont realize it. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:18:52
Yes, I heard about that but I'm more worried about my security which blockchain.info dont provide due to many cases of stolen bitcoin, so I'm going to switch to another wallet, This samourai looks good what do you think about electrum one? 
@_date: 2019-02-05 17:39:02
I just asked a question, is that a non-adult thing? 
@_date: 2019-02-11 16:20:06
Yes that's true, but I've seen that when you make a transaction on wasabi wallet 0.2% of your fees you'll go to the owner of this wallet, so how is that? They control your transactions? WHAT... 
@_date: 2019-02-27 00:03:20
Use bitcoin to buy material stuff that I always wish I had, and keep hodl I'll never convert to fiat again because fiat doens't worth shit 
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:47:44
How can we send 50 satoshi to the real bitcoin layer? will be possible to send 50 satoshi to the real bitcoin layer? 
@_date: 2019-02-18 04:40:06
could... 
@_date: 2019-02-24 18:29:10
That's really sad, but remember about the guy that bought 500k in bitcoin when it was at 18k? lmfao...then he got pissed off and sold at 6k... and re-bought at 4k... 
@_date: 2019-02-06 10:08:39
He said he had problem paying 50$ fees back in 2017, But they released the segwit and LN after that fees problem, so we suppose to dont have this problem anymore, right?
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:37:46
I've been people telling me about this 51% attack, that shit scary af.  
Is that the attack when they send to someone wallet a low bitcoin value? 
@_date: 2019-02-26 23:46:19
I was trolling lol. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 18:43:03
The one billion question is, theres any chance of this issue fees happens again?

@_date: 2019-02-25 03:06:34
So yes, they can do that!...
I already have seen people get missed out or disappearing when bitcoin got 20k per coin, now imagine bitcoin at 50k or even 100k. 
We never know about the future, the best option is always to be prepped 
@_date: 2019-02-26 23:55:01
Good point, but no one really know who is the wealthy, but now thankfully for exchanges, they even know your address which make easier to track you. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 03:40:11
this value is only in venezuelan, if you convert this amount of dolar to real dolar it would be less than 1 dolar, that's how inflation in venezuela works.

@_date: 2019-02-08 17:06:35
I thought you were trolling me, really?  I'll need to wait till 1 satoshi worth 1 dolar? "maybe only in 2025 in 6 years?", And I cant buy anything with LN aswell? You hurts me so much. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 20:41:19
it definitely can, just put the market of gold in perspective. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:39:58
Nothing is impossible, but I can already imagine ppls dissapering if that happens, imagine how many ppls would want that bitcoins..

Connector that's tru but no CIA will go after your ip or transactions just to take your bitcoins always, or will they? Maybe if bitcoin hits moon someday but for now we are ok.
Also what's the most security and private coins today?

@_date: 2019-02-24 16:40:14
I live in a third world country, I saved during all the year of 2018 around 300 dolar, I saw bitcoin in 3.3k, then was waiting to drop around 2.5k to buy more as possible, but bitcoin went to 4k again I thought I couldnt lose the "opportunity" to buy right now, so I did.. I regret so badly man. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 12:47:01
Thank you for this information I'm going to learn more about that.
What can guarantee that this Wasabi Wallet is really safe and has privacy on it? But thanks anyways!

@_date: 2019-02-11 16:49:11

What do you think about ppls that will open lightning network first? They will make some money on it maybe? 
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:14:09
Do you think maybe in 2025, 50 satoshi could worth 1 dolar? why exactly? 
@_date: 2019-02-24 23:44:55
Michel  thats true, After reading this 5 dollar wrech attacks, I realized that I had to send my address and face picture to the exchange that I used to buy some bitcoins, now I'm feeling really unsafe in case bitcoin rise again.
What can I do now to prevent it?
@_date: 2019-02-05 17:37:35
For sure, but with bitcoin is something different.. Imagine alot of ppls around the world getting rich, the thief eyes will be like "I gotta rob some of these nerds" 
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:10:23
2 years from now, "I invested when it was 3.9k"  currently bitcoin price: 200 bucks. 
just kidding.. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:27:00
Even tho I only own 0.1 btc? I'm pissed off anyways.. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:42:53
That was funny, but I think that's true I'll edit the post. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 16:20:02
Yes I met bitcoin 7 month ago, my thought is to invest and hoping that bitcoin will go up someday and I'll make some money, even tho I only had enough money to buy 0.05 btc lmfao.  
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:18:53
Lets stop using blockchain.info then..
@_date: 2019-02-05 17:34:02
lmfao nibba. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 17:35:56
What do you mean? I thought some of you from this reddit had more than that, because alot of ppls that bought bitcoin when it was cents still have it.. Some people have around 5k bitcoins I think. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 03:03:13
For those saying that bitcoin is not Private, Say hi to LN faggs.. &lt;3 love all! 
@_date: 2019-02-02 12:10:51

@_date: 2019-04-24 21:25:40
why is that?
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:57:08
0.1 btc isn't that much at all, bcuz even if bitcoin reach higher volume that amount wont be that much . 
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:26:37
Sometime that's the only problem with company and bitcoin, they always want your information like ID, birthday, face-selfie, this is totally wrong, the right should be buy the credit card with email and then send bitcoin into the credit card without problem, those company must learn how to do business.
@_date: 2019-04-17 14:53:01
3.3k was the bottom for sure, I doubt it because many bitcoin expert were saying "It will go to 1.5k yet" and I did hear them.. I regret btw
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:44:24
I own only 0.1 anyways even if bitcoin gets higher that amount of btc wont be that much so...  
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:22:49
Oh man I think I'll never have one full btc because 5k dolar isnt easy to get. 
So I'll stay in the 210 million club with my 0.01 btc lmfao..
@_date: 2019-04-17 14:56:05
That's kinda fake and true at same. There's no jihadist in activity in syria rn, But for sure they used bitcoin or crypto..
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:56:23

\-How much a average person owns btc in 2020 to 2023?
\-Did you heard anything about the most used language in a very far future like 2030 - 2100?
\-How can I time travel?
@_date: 2019-01-31 20:26:43

@_date: 2019-05-11 05:02:44
10 million? I don't believe so this amount is too much buddy.. too much..
@_date: 2019-05-23 03:53:15
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:08:31
I mean 0.1 bitcoin wont be that much cmon... 30k? 100k? idk dude..
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:38:10
probably alot, the inflation was so high that he could become a milionarie with only 0.01 btc, so... probablt a lot.
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:50:06
How can I take this guy seriously? he is literally mentioning prostitutes and eat dick.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:56:40
Your status eventually will be the amount of btc you got, much more you got better you'll be. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 11:33:50
lmao 
@_date: 2019-05-23 05:42:22
it affects anyone.
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:04:13
Wait he said "if you own more than 0.01 bitcoin you'll be ultra-rich? damn, How is that with only 100k? 100k isn't nothing it don't even make you rich at all.
Also he mentioned if someone is a earlier adopter of bitcoin he must change his identity bcuz people would chase you or kill you, How'd someone know who I am? maybe tro exchange databases?
@_date: 2018-12-17 07:21:48
The problem is, There's no low price or high price, there is just a price.
So How we know the right time to buy it? What if I buy now and price goes down -50% more? 
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:51:00
What if don't happen and it go straight to 20k?
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:31:55
Time travel must be real, they do put this things in movie for no reason duuur.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:09:40
What a positive perspective, that took a smile from my face not gonna lie, but I'd have to wait more 50 years to that happen, 80m is a lot man.. a lot..
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:32:04
What makes you think that? I thought it was bull run
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:53:30
That makes sense, so nasa created it to be easier to control people even more? That makes sense to be honest, but metal gold will always be metal gold with some value and people could buy it and become untraceable again.
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:29:55
Its not a donwloaded zip of bitaddress but the HTML cript which don't contain any malware, so how could it be a bad ideia?
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:11:03
Thank you for this tipping! I really appreciate that :) 
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:24:56
I' definitely spend all in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-17 08:40:01

@_date: 2018-12-18 12:50:48
Damn, back in there 130$ buck worth 2 btc, I'd love at this price. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:37:01
Hell yeah, I really think this one is the one. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:36:05
So... you think there is still a chance to go down a little bit more? 
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:56:53
Dont Worry be happy. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:06:35
Why is that?

Graydoggames good job my bro keep hodl.
@_date: 2018-12-17 11:38:36
How do you get bitcoins? With Fiat money. 
Fiat money is very important and hard to get.
Why peoples care so much when buy and when sell? that's the reason.
I think 80% of people already understand how bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 13:53:14
Fingernails damn son cut it off. 
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:37:27
you mean mountain in nepal?
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:32:48
Never is a strong word.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:56:32
Theres only 19 million of bitcoin and not 21 because alot of coin were lost right?
I don't think every money in the world would be invested in bitcoin, maybe half percent of it. so its possible to bitcoin hits around 10 million per coin? lol.
@_date: 2019-05-29 10:58:52
Tell me about security and safety.
In the future exchanges will be a huge problem right? Like the early exchanges of today will definitely sell or use the personal information of buyers from today to steal their coins into they own house right? .
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:07:12
That's what ppls say but idk.... I'd be much happier if I could afford to buy 1 bitcoin, just imagine that ..
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:50:13
damn only 0.002? this is the today currently fees right?
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:17:33
yes, and if you don't buy right now you never will.
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:12:04
I think the max it can go is around 200k per bitcoin in 10 years, maybe more...
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:04:19
I mean I wish this time traveler were real, imagine that... 100m per bitcoin? Is that possible? 
If that happen you'd see a billionaire in every single street because today almost everybody has a little bit of bitcoin right?
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:32:10
But it does..
@_date: 2019-05-29 10:08:19
That's exactly what I thought, it just doesn't make a damn sense at all.
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:08:40
I think your strategy is way better, Because I bought bitcoin when it was 6k.
The price goes down to 3.2k and I lose 50% of my "investment".
Even if the price one day recover and goes moon, I still lose opportunity to had more bitcoin. 
Now, what if I sold when I lost 10%, now I would have 90% of my investment yet, because I could buy in the 3.2k, and probably get more bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:36:38
Exactly, but the price is very stable right now.
@_date: 2018-12-26 15:30:16
Better than the original one. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:00:51
"bitcoin is dead" 
\-1 hour later
\-He bought 500k worth in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:17:55
go ahead kid, buy some bitcoin and wait to going down. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:19:40
I wish it was real.
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:19:24
Next year it will hit above 10k. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:03:58
0.1 btc wont make me rich? Think twice, what if bitcoin reach 10 million witch is possible. 
What bitcoin hitso nly 100k? its alot of money already not gonna lie.. 
Some people live in third world and they really can't afford to buy more than 0.1 btc so respect that.
@_date: 2019-05-19 03:49:09
yeah but if you use a offline computer that never goes online so then youre safe.
@_date: 2019-05-17 00:49:44
That's what im saying we never know where this beast is going to go..
@_date: 2018-12-02 08:34:38
OK, but if they starting buying a big amount of btc to control it in a near future, so why the price is not getting higher? 
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:28:49
Lol, I was just wondering about that, I never seen anyone making a post about that before. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:44:02
Not early? I'd love buy in 1k lol. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 07:57:11
What is a good investment strategy? 
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:40:19
I mean, if its true just imagine how rich the 21 million would be? is that even possible to 21 million people have that much money? I don't think so the world wealthy isn't that big yet...
I mean.... 1k 10k is completely possible but 100k and 1m? idk dude..
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:58:48
Just start accumulating by now. 
@_date: 2019-05-23 03:54:06
Damn so he knew all your games password? HOW? did he literally hacked your Pc and got it with keylogger? or he hacked your email or something?
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:02:19
Same shit here.
This beast never goes down dude, Fomo'd in aswell....
If it drops to 4.5k as people are saying I'd be really, really pissed off..
@_date: 2019-05-28 03:28:04
holy moly you've been here since 2010? 
Thats alot... alot...
@_date: 2018-12-15 10:21:07
Damnit!  After I read about "bitcoin in the future" and a guy explaining that in a near future 23% of bitcoin richer made this fortune by "physically tortured someone" to give them they wallet password. So Now it all makes sence, its very simple! they just find a target them find they place/live home and torture him to give bitcoin password with this lie detector, everything makes sence now.                                          That's why ppls should open carry atleast a revolver.  
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:35:18
I mean 8k isn't much. if you compare 600 to 8k for sure, but it wont be the opportunity of my life like for others who bought 10 bitcoin or more at 3.2k.
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:54:28
I cant believe that. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 08:41:45
thinking it could go lower... now of course I regret.
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:15:23
Nice point, that's what I'm thinking, bitcoin is way ahead.
But ppls always complain about bitcoin fees being so high or slow. 
idk.. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 13:52:34
2020 We all are going to see what happens. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:20:46


@_date: 2018-12-01 00:29:43
Lol I did different, I bought at 19k and sold at 4k.... my life is ruined.. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:54:24
What if someone bought 100k a year ago? maybe he would have 16k.  S A D 
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:26:33
"Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO ITS GOING DOWN IM GONNA SELL" lmao. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 08:35:10
Albert eiteins? That got me cracked laughing lmao 
No seriously, it was actually Abraham Lincoln
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:19:48
OH MAY GOSH, that beast is 8.3k already and keep going...
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:03:51
I'd be happy if something spectacular happens and in 3 years we get that value, but otherwise I don't believe so.
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:59:11
Exactly, Thank you to understand me man! I'll keep in this slavery for a long time yet..
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:02:56
Dont pavement smoke human! 
@_date: 2018-12-15 10:55:42
400$? I'd sell even my dog to buy all I could at that price. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:31:52
lmao lol 
@_date: 2018-12-02 04:01:45
Better to try than give up.
