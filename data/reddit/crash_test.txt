Yes, if you own a business, you get to decide (within the law) who you do or do not do business with.

I bugged them 3 or 4 times while my approval was pending, they didn't respond to any of the tickets and my approval still took a little over 3 months. The service itself has been good but the verification and customer support aspects are dogshit.

When people say decentralized, they're referring to the protocol, not coin distribution or price. The fact that some people own crazy amounts of coins has no effect on the decentralization of the bitcoin network.

I think the point is, if you aren't selling *right now* then why do you need to maximize your profit *right now*? In the long term would you rather have 500 btc that are worth $50 because people don't feel the network is secure, or 250 btc that are worth $1000 because there's no network concerns.
Obvious this is a hypothetical situation but regardless of the numbers it seems pretty obviously that concerns about the network are hurting the price and may keep bitcoin from widespread acceptance if something isn't done about it.

BTC can't be sent without using a previously unspent output. In this particular case, that means using a 30k BTC output to send 0.8316 BTC, plus 1464 sat in fees, with the remaining 29,999.16838536 BTC being change.
[Here's a pretty good explanation of how outputs and inputs work.](
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:24:55
I'm not saying it's true 100% of the time, but the vast majority of these "someone paid $0.0000001 to send 50 bajillion bitcoin" posts are from people who don't understand how change works.
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:12:07
If one output has a full 8 decimal places and the other output has less, it's pretty safe to assume that the 8 decimal output is change and the other output is the "real" transaction.
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:52:23
Again, it doesn't even matter because it's just semantics at this point. Sure you can argue it "hit the network", and you'd be correct because that's how Bitcoin works on a fundamental level, but the money didn't change hands or even leave his wallet, so saying that money was "sent", in a traditional sense, is incorrect. I'm curious if you'd feel the same if the change addressed used was the same as the sending address.
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:10:08
So if this person sent 1 satoshi to a random address 5000 times, would you claim that they sent over a trillion dollars? Because according to your definition that would be the case, when it clearly isn't what actually happened.
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:36:40


It's not really even an analogy, it's just this transaction taken to the extreme to point out how incorrect the conclusion is.


The banking equivalent of the 48500 BTC part of this transaction would be like transferring some huge amount of money from one of your accounts to another within the same bank. In my experience this is always free and essentially instant, since the money isn't changing ownership or going to a different institution. The part that's comparable to an expensive and slow process like wire transfers or money orders would be the 0.1 BTC transaction. And sending ~$600 for 4 cents in fees and ~1hr in confirmation time is still cool, but it's not exactly newsworthy.
Ultimately it doesn't even matter and it's a stupid discussion to have because of the way bitcoin transactions work. Yes, the entire 48500 BTC was moved, because the way inputs and outputs work demands that it be moved, even though this person only really sent 0.1 BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-28 08:20:11
What's the more likely scenario here, that this person sent all but 0.1 BTC of their 48,500.188 total BTC, or that they sent 0.1 BTC and the remaining 48,500.08799325 BTC is the change?
Judging by the fact that one output is a nice round number and the other has a full 8 decimal places, it's pretty safe to assume that the actual TX was for 0.1BTC and the rest went to a change address.
Edit: Also if you go back through the previous addresses there's some other small TXs with huge change outputs, so this is definitely a 0.1BTC TX.
@_date: 2018-06-29 21:08:53


It seems like this is just a misunderstanding of how change works then? Whether the change goes back to the same address or to a new one doesn't really matter here, the only difference in the entire transaction would be the ScriptPubKey of the change output. It would get "moved" just as much regardless of whether it goes to a new address or back to the same address.
@_date: 2018-06-29 21:59:53


No, it wouldn't. It would show an output of 0.1BTC to whatever address it was sent to and then it would show an output of 48,500.18799325 BTC going back to the sending address. [Here's an example of what that looks like]( It's not possible to only send part of a previously unspent output, you have to send the entire thing, sending the part you actually want to send to whatever address you want to send it to, and then sending the change (ie. the remaining balance of the input) to a change address. This change address can be the same address you sent from, or, if you want to be more secure, it can be a fresh, unused address.


I agree, which is why I said it's kind of a pointless discussion. Cash and bank accounts don't have concepts like "unspent outputs" and "change addresses", so comparing them to bitcoin for purposes like this ignores a lot of the nuances of how the bitcoin protocol works.

Lol if that's a scam what do you call Gemini? Had to wait 3 months for verification and they didn't respond to 4 support tickets.
@_date: 2017-04-25 04:22:33
I could be wrong but I think the freaking out had more to do with full employment and the fear of high inflation than the fact that there was a surplus.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:48:53
I tried switching to Gemini 3 months ago but my account is still pending verification. I've sent 3 or 4 emails in that time asking for info and gotten 0 response. I know Coinbase's support is far from perfect, but in my (admittedly limited) experience, Gemini's is totally nonexistent.

That's also just a link to some other user's post? OP's not even involved, despite the title.
@_date: 2018-07-04 19:37:50
Kind of a stupid article if it completely ignores the possibility of shorting.
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:28:30


You're right, but this comes back to the


point. Increased block size predicated on increase in BTC price means a higher % TX fee in USD, which is all the end user cares about, but most miners don't want an increased block size since it reduces or eliminates their only incentive for mining, which is profit. But keeping the same 1MB block size predicated on an increase in TX fees to prevent low fee TXs is doubly bad for the end user since it limits transaction volume (and network reliability as a result) while also increasing fees, which is also bad for miners since it turns the majority of potential users off of Bitcoin. It's literally a lose/lose, which is why I say both sides will have to make compromises if anything is going to work in the long run.
@_date: 2015-11-06 11:14:05


I agree with this 100%, since the only options at this point either screw over miners or screw over the end users. But it's obvious that something needs to be done in the near future, while those layer 2 solutions are created and tested, to allow people to use bitcoin with some level of confidence.
@_date: 2015-11-06 09:32:32
2036 isn't really "short term" though, at least by data storage/transfer standards. That's 20 years away. Where were we at 20 years ago? 1 gigabyte hard drives and 28k modems. There's been at least a thousandfold increase between then and now. Who's to say in another 20 years that petabyte hard drives and internet speeds in the tens or even hundreds of gigabits won't be the norm?
I think there's plenty of things to pick apart with OP's predictions (24,000 tps and $36 billion yearly in transaction fees seems pretty far fetched to me), but the viability of 8GB blocks in 20 years isn't really high on my list.
@_date: 2015-11-06 10:45:52
Absolutely, I think most people feel the same way, which is why nobody is arguing for 8GB blocks *right now*. Obviously there's no need to set something like that in stone at this point. But the argument that 8GB blocks in 20 years would "completely end decentralization" isn't really a strong one, in my opinion, nor is it particularly relevant to what's going on currently. And even if that were the case, it's not an excuse to pooh-pooh a relatively small increase in block size now.
@_date: 2015-11-06 11:33:05
But the goal shouldn't be to have a network that only works under "normal circumstances". A network that only works under normal circumstances isn't reliable, which means it isn't attractive to the vast majority of potential users.
And I understand that some people want mass adoption for Bitcoin while others want Bitcoin to be a decentralized, "censorship-resistant currency", as you called it, but it's becoming more and more obvious that we can't have our cake and eat it too. Some compromises will have to be made, or no change will happen and both sides will be unhappy.
@_date: 2015-11-06 11:06:00
And I would agree that 8MB blocks, at this time, are unnecessary. I think BIP-100 is a better solution. But even if the cap is raised to 8MB in January, it's reasonable to assume we wouldn't immediately start seeing full 8MB blocks become the norm. Odds are you'll have years between the cap increase and the point where transaction volume has increased to where every block is near the cap, if we ever get to that point at all. Obviously it remains to be seen whether internet speeds will allow your average Joe to be able to run a full node when we get to that point, but the alternative is basically to tell people "this payment system isn't fit for widespread use, find some other avenue to do your business".
@_date: 2015-11-06 11:53:09
The fact that the system even has the potential for a couple hours of backlog as it is should be completely unacceptable, from a functionality standpoint. What use is the network if its usability isn't reliable?
