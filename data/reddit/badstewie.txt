I'm a nervous wreck right now. I'm doubling up on my blood pressure meds. I didn't invest more than I care to lose but it's not a small amount, relatively.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:45:19
i was set to get a $250 payout tommorrow. Shady as fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:28:24
My balls ache from trying not to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:12:01
I'm planning on buying another thousand bucks of bitcoin tommorrow? Good or bad idea?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:26:24
Bought another $1000. Fingers crossed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:10:31
I'm mulling over the 250 dollars i lost on nicehash while ignoring the fact that the value of my bitcoin rose 3000 dollars. The fuck is wrong with me?
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:45:49
Well this got me scared... I have all my holdings of BTC, ETH and XRP on Poloniex. I think I'm gonna get myself one of those hardware wallets.
@_date: 2018-09-03 07:08:45
to any filipinos on here, something is fucked up with coins ph.
btc price is stuck at 6600 usd if you wanna sell your btc while everywhere else its at 7200. we're not experiencing gains from this little bull run. even if i stored my btc in another exchange like coinbase or in a hardware wallet, i would still have to route it thru coin ph if i want to convert to fiat. sucks man.

So what do we do? Buy? Sell? Eat cookies?
I have no idea. Something inside me tells me to buy more 'coz this is just a dip and something else is telling me to sell now
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:56:07
Hoping to see another dip so I can buy again.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:55:02
I want to buy more but I'm already sweating my balls of trying not to sell. Hopefully I can buy another $1000 tomorrow... AFTER I get my valium. (Coz face it, some people really need to calm down)
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:03:18
I was gonna hodl until I can buy a Ducati. Looks like that's not gonna happen now. Should have sold back in December. Now I got no choice but to hodl. Don't get me wrong.  I'm still up. I bought a few BTC when it was $2000.   
But my Ducati, man. I could be falling off of it right now,
@_date: 2018-08-29 09:30:05
Just bought at 7k. Hope it doesn't bite me in the ass. I would've bought sooner but local exchange in the Philippines won't let me because I reached my monthly "limit" of buy-ins.
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:29:21
Is this another dip? Should I buy more?
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:48:32
fucking hell... it'll reach 5500?? damn man.
@_date: 2018-08-05 13:23:53
I feel like I should buy more... but has it bottomed yet? I definitely thought the price would go up coz of the ETF but the reverse happened.
Fuck it though. I got extra cash. I'm gonna go get me some BTC. I'm not some chump that just puts it into a savings account all safe and shit. I'm gonna put it into something volatile. My doc says my blood pressure is too normal anyway. My heart could use some tense shit.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:19:35
I'm tapping out. Bought a couple thousand dollars worth last night and it dropped. I'm just gonna hodl.
@_date: 2018-08-19 01:18:02
I really fucking hope the price stays down until the end of this month. I already hit my monthly limit of buy-ins. Stupid CoinsPH won't let me buy in more than 7500 per month until I give them some sort of proof that I can afford it.
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:42:13
if you say so
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:53:12
i don't think that exists... 
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:02:37
shit. i thought it was moving up again.
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:30:02
Nope. I'm debt free dickwad. But if I did have debt, I would pay  it instead of buying Bitcoin... because priorities. And I'm hodling tight.
edit: spelling
@_date: 2018-08-07 08:48:21
I will probably buy $2000 worth more. Thankfully I just bought $500 worth when it was $8K last week.
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:09:20
I'm really frustrated 'coz if my local exchange would've let me buy last week, the price would have been at just 6k. You know what's even more frustrating? Buying at my local exchange is like 300 dollars more than when you're selling. So like if I bought 1 bitcoin from them at market price, it's actual worth when it gets to my wallet is 300 dollars less.
COINBASE PLEASE ALLOW BUYS IN MY COUNTRY!

Had my legacy account frozen too. Did the verification. 5 minutes later I'm back to trading again. Thankful that my verification was fast.
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:15:00
A lot of bank accounts boutta get frozen
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:26:12
You guys are gonna have to tell me some reassuring shit to calm me down tho. Coz I wanted to sell when it hit 11k but didn't coz "hodl" or some shit.
It could be the booze or the weed talking but I'm freaking the fuck out, man.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:35:51
You should do it yourself. I feel like you feel you deserve it lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:39:29
Bought $1000 worth when it was at $6000. I would have bought more but Coinbase doesn't accept transactions from my country. 
I remember when it was just over $2000 several months back and stupid me focused on Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:34:10
Well damn.
@_date: 2018-07-27 17:07:31
I'm always thinking about how bad we have it here in the Philippines... then I take a look at countries like Venezuela, Liberia, and other countries that are waaay worse off than us and I can't help but be thankful of what we have now.
