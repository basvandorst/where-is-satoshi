Seriously phneep... this your work?

Love it
Not surprised to see the leading edge of crypto art popping out of Brighton before London

It's definitely a market disruptor...  Western Union must surely be thinking "oooops"... they didn't see it coming 
As for killer app? I'm not sure... it's integrating with other services instead of standing on its own
Killer apps are self sufficient and self sustaining

Well done Vinay... considering your audience I think you pitched your presentation perfectly... enough laymans terms to give them the understanding that they have no other option other than to embrace it, but enough technical jargon so they know they're out of their depths and can not fake it... no wonder you had to drink so much water, your mouth must've been as dry as the audience  ;o)

Who has the right to decide what a human being wants to use to exchange value?
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:10:48
Why?... the more we ask them how we play their game, the more power we hand over to them... SEC approval isn't necessary for mass adoption... it'll only be a short term boost... which is great for those who are purely speculative investors.., the long term game without SEC approval will yield the same result and people will retain full sovereignty over their personal wealth and value

Ok where do I sign up for first available copies?... 
will you consider getting some comic/anime artwork done ?
F'k it turn it into a pop-up  ;o) 
Seriously I'd love to read this, the artwork would be a huge bonus
If you start slowing down in your progress of writing chapters, you could always think of the pictures

Isn't it technically impossible to ban? 
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:33:04
So the digital megalodons are pushing for regulation... it's great we might see a huge increase in price BUT asking for regulation is like handing over the power of sovereignty 
@_date: 2017-05-17 23:54:31
I agree the government will make concessions... but I don't agree they will simply ban it... I think that move is highly questionable and will be met with great public resistance... the decision to ban Bitcoin infringes on human rights
I am of the opinion that if you think the government can ban or make illegal what you chose as a human being to be a fair exchange of value, then you are allowing your government to tell you how to live, you are acting like a prisoner or slave
You have the right to sell your house for a box of cornflakes if you so wished
Governments are better off embracing Bitcoin and making concessions with regulation in order to extract some tax from such a trade

I live it mate... the graph unfortunately didn't show when I went from iOS Reddit app browser to safari. 
Apart from that it's clean.  
I could make a tonne of suggestions for what I'd like to see as additional features that didn't overwhelm its tidy simplicity (I'm guessing you'll already be inundated ) 
Good work... interesting to see where you take this

Craig Wright is definitely connected to Satoshi by 1 degree of Kevin Bacon or less... one thing is for certain, he is a seriously clever dude... read up on some of his achievements...
I believe Satoshi Nakamoto is just 2 people, with a group of advisors 
Craig Wright was one of the advisors 
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:40:22
Mate I think he is something of a charlatan... but he is definitely close to the genesis
How can he convince a couple of the core guys?  Gavin Andresen for fcks sake??? 
He's damned clever my friend...
Some day they'll make a movie 
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:51:22
Yes and improves your IQ
Get some gorgeous... have you seen this?
 
I see both sides my friend 
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:16:07
I'd read the whole whole page it's a fascinating read... 
 
He's done a tonne of stuff including designing the architecture for arguably the worlds first online casino (Lasseters), was a lead in developing the Australian Securities Exchange and has built one of the worlds most powerful super computers 
He's also got some dodgy stuff in the past too because he doesn't play by the rules 
He's a very interesting individual to say the least

Ha yeh got it User Agent /Satoshi:0.14.2/UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148)/ 
A load of other info there too
Luke huge thanks for helping me out there, I know you're a busy guy so it's been really appreciated.
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:51:55
I'm not saying he is Satoshi... Just that he's a guy who has convinced a couple of those 'closest ' to Satoshi that he's the one 
I don't think he's the one, but he must surely know something to be able to convince the core  
As a diversionary tactic it makes sense for him to be a fall guy to draw attention away... to be ridiculed... to confuse... to make people forget 
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:17:40
I've never been a huge fan of the Reddit websites usability... the mobile app though is brilliant 
@_date: 2017-07-06 07:52:28
I'm guessing you're referring to the 'anonymity is for cowards' remark... 
I agree, it's unlikely that our beloved Satoshi would say something like that... well at least we imagine they wouldn't 
So I'm still wondering how is it possible that he has been able to convince Gavin Andresen? 
1) he is extraordinarily clever and/or 2) he must have some insider knowledge 
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:05:35
No ice thank you

As far as I'm aware criminal use of Bitcoin is minimum... it's a mainstream media hype... it gets used for sure but so does the £ € $ ¥ etc etc..,  the vast majority of its uses are trading, charity and remittances 
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:47:19
How did he convince Gavin Andresen then? 
Isn't that insane? 
Did you see Vitalik Butterins response? 
 
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:17:33
Absolutely... from the genesis block... and he could do it publicly so that anyone can verify it
Did you watch Vitalik Buterins response to this?

It's game theory

Ok cheers mate... I get it... I'm definitely looking for a unicorn though... 
E.G. Signup... pay with card or PayPal... get bitcoin  sent to your address 
Simplicity + Speed = Unicorn
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:43:58
Thanks again for pointing that out... I thought it looked odd... where does a guy go though to get this sorted?
I used the instructions  &lt;180 Releases&gt; but for the mac osx-unsigned.dmg  
Who do I go to for help... is my version not going to work?  It seems to connect to the network, catch up with transactions and currently has about 19 other connections and rising
Are you able to point me in the way of a fix?
'm keen to support BIP148
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:33:02
That sounds like you use snail mail... seriously? Do you send them your pay check?... I'm guessing that's a US thing
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:31:59
Cheers mate I thought as much.  I was hoping for a unicorn. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:13:37
Cheers whitslack... I see there's 556 nodes... a surprisingly small amount for what is literally a global issue... what do you think is the reason for the low turn out ?
I can appreciate how some might not be showing their cards just yet for a variety of reasons... 
also, I appreciate that even though hundreds of millions have bought bitcoin in the last couple of years, downloading the entire blockchain since the genesis block is a pretty big barrier to entry 
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:00:03
Apologies... here's a more serious reply...
There's been such a hype about finding Satoshi and it will never go away because the media will never go away and there's a shit load of money to be had by selling media for the exclusive breaking news etc etc 
If you create a fall guy to ridicule it changed the tempo/vibration of the energy trying to find Satoshi... it makes the subject less valuable and worthless 
I believe he is close to Satoshi, NOT part of it 
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:49:39
Thank you Luke, really appreciate it...  I've installed using the instructions you gave below... Bitcoin Core version v0.14.2.0-3a051b8 (64-bit)... I just checked Bitnodes, theres 1018 running 0.14.2...  I can't tell which of those have BIP148
For the record I'm enforcing BIP148 because being dictated to by miners is nothing more than an oligarchy, and a glorified centralised system
From a more technical point of view I understand segwit opens up far more greater opportunities (as well as a blocksize increase)
Anyway thanks again
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:37:29
Thanks for your response... I've only played with LocalBitcoins a little bit and got the sense it's still a little beyond the average layman.   I will revisit it. Cheers 
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:12:08
Well I don't know whether there is a problem... its more the fact you pointed out my version says:
    Bitcoin Core version v0.14.2.0-3a051b8 (64-bit)    
instead of
    /Satoshi:0.14.2/UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148)/
Like I say, it seems to be working... transaction history synced, 22 connections... how do I check?
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:56:37
By new software, do you mean the latest version  bitcoin core QT node ver 0.14.2 ?  
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:43:17
Thanks for your response... it's what I figured... I really am looking for a unicorn 
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:41:35
I've never found it that simple especially recently...   once you get through the KYC checks, which can be a real headache, you then have to get your bank verified and the last time I did that they said it would take up to 72 hours.  You're right though, none of it is that difficult just a pain.  But it seems like the only option.
