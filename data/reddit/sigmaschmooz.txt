no it isn't!  have you been to China?
@_date: 2016-08-24 12:38:16
because I don't have a Chinese bank account

total revenue is a lot, but it still sucks to see that money evaporate just so people can move some numbers

I'm their biggest client, but they're simple people, they don't like new things
@_date: 2016-08-24 18:27:09
you're right, I already absorb 100% of bank fees

I import sunglasses, [Woodies.com](

2.9% ?  Are you nuts?

New Zealand's biggest newspaper??  Well that's credibility enough for me. 
First line of the article it cites 'Internet sources' as a source. You are the dunce I can't believe I'm even wasting time trying to educate you
@_date: 2016-08-24 12:39:37
it's difficult to tell them simple stuff.  This would be WAY over their heads
@_date: 2016-08-24 18:26:31
huh?  I need my supplier for my business to run.  My supplier doesn't know what openbazaaar is, I'm not sure I do
@_date: 2016-08-24 18:28:42
why would this be helpful?  I think you're missing the point
@_date: 2016-08-24 12:40:29
but then there's the cost of, ya know, flying to China to cash it out locally
@_date: 2016-08-24 12:41:31
They don't understand it would be the first issue

Give some money to Puerto Rico!  They're on the ground helping real people
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:33:46
This is a pretty adequate response guys 
Coinbase. Some better communication would have stemmed this

This thread shows what a big gap that exists between (me) casual bitcoiner and the technical bitcoiner

I expect people to post news of significance, and upvote news of significance.  To be fair, only one of these two expectations need be met
@_date: 2014-03-15 08:14:17
I'm good for one whole bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:44:57
Wow people that actually know Bitcoin-computer things are coming out in this thread.  You guys are wayyy ahead
@_date: 2014-01-25 03:09:51
Just admit it's meaningless I guess
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:38:01
Yea it looks like you have to bet 5X the bonus amount
They were really sketchy about their bitcoin payout at first.  First, it wasn't available.  Then I inquired about it and they said it's available to 'some' users.  Now it's available on my account after I deposited.  I wonder if they're not allowed to explicitly say they payout in bitcoin, but they do if you ask
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:19:51
I'd be freaking skeptical.  Why would he sell it below market price?  He doesn't like money?
@_date: 2016-07-07 03:36:30
Or you could buy Bitcoin if you think it's going up
Or sell sell it if you think it's going down
@_date: 2013-12-26 13:57:35
Ah thanks
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:10:43
I guess I wanted to show people what I was talking about...this idiot keeps emailing me these
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:04:47
it seems like you know more about investing, and the terms people use when they describe movement of a market.  but your prediction has a very small chance of playing out exactly like you say, you have no evidence to back up your prediction, it's 100% gut feeling, and you pass it off with 100% certainty.  it's just bizarre
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:49:29
I think this is the case, I have no proof, but that's it
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:41:25
help me out, what's a bull trap?
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:42:06
nvm, googled it, duh
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:09:15
THIS..Occam's Razor
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:19:12
I guess it's just testing your whole underlying premise.  Do you posit that past performance of other commodities and stocks will help you predict trends in bitcoin?  I would say no.  There is no precedent, so all that Wall Street speak is moot
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:40:23
to the previous 6 weeks of bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:41:02
this sounds so crazy.  do you realize how nuts your paragraphs sound?  were you actually making a joke about bitcoin speculators?  or was that serious logic?
