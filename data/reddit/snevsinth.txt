The technical bottom should be 2900 (look it up if you want, "serious companies" have done the technical analysis on Fibonacci sequences and the golden ratio and what have you). They say that a top at 4900 is only established if the price goes down to 2900. That is a fact.

Some countries in Africa and other countries with unstable money handling could for sure benefit if they direct they money into bitcoin instead of their mismanaged currency of today.
But it have to happen from the root up though...

Is it just me, or am I observing the "east" rising very fast these days, and the "west" now being cropped by regulators trying to keep their hegemony and preventing people and progress?  We are witnessing a dawn of a new era....

I think you made a wise choice exchanging your 25 to bitcoin.. it is still money but it is the money of the future.
