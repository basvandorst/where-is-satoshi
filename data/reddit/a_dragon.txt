I wish I could buy right now but I bought on Friday and it won’t let me buy again on coinbase until that transaction goes through, which they said would take 8 days. By then it will most likely be back up. 
Are all exchanges like this!? I mostly wanted to use my .5 bitcoin to buy alt coins but can’t because I have to wait. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:45:25
Day long!? I wish!
I’ve had to wait 8 days for nine and I still haven’t gotten it. I feel so helpless right now. I spent the money already but I can’t fucking do anything with it. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:48:31
It’s worse for me because I planned on buying alts with my BTC. I don’t think you have anything to worry about. It will go up again, but I now have to use the depreciated value of my BTC to buy alts because if I wait until BTC begins to go up again my alts will have likely also stabilized.
I’m not really pissed at the market, I’m pissed that I was uninformed about how long it would take to receive my BTC after buying it on Coinbase. If I had my way I would have bought my alts right then and there but I had to wait 8 days. It sucks that I was locked into the BTC price at the time of purchase and wasn’t able to do anything with it. IMHO they should refund me the difference. 
If I buy something I should get it right then, not 8 days later when I’ve already lost a ton of money. They took away all of my agency in what I wanted to do with my BTC.

@_date: 2019-07-23 02:42:47
Well of course it does. This whole money laundering scare is intended to frighten people away from buying BTC because the financial institutions are afraid of losing their icy grip over the people’s money.

Again people are saying “always sell for cash”, but what if you have sufficiently large amounts of BTC. Wouldn’t a sudden cash influx of hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars look suspicious to the IRS? How do you explain that other than selling off a bunch of BTC, in which case you might as well have just used a KYC exchange as your final out instead of selling for cash. Honestly, what do you do if you bought a bunch of BTC when they were ten cents a piece and want to cash them in now for millions of dollars? How do you prove to the IRS, who will inevitably be knocking at your door, that you purchased your BTC legitimately? 
BTC seems fine if you can spend it on goods directly (and I’m sorry but if you think those BTC ATMs aren’t essentially honeypots being monitored by the feds 24/7 you’re delusional), but since the government placed so many regulations on them coupled with the fact that they’ve been essentially tainted by criminal organizations using them, it just doesn’t seem like a viable form of currency anymore. You’re basically waiting for it to become integrated into every form of financial transaction, like credit cards, before you can actually do anything with them without the IRS getting on your ass. 
I get the potential utility and all, and if I lived in an oppressive regime I would probably purchase some, but otherwise it seems like a hard pass to me since there’s no way to actually use them without looking like a criminal.
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:37:49
BTC runs on cryptographic principals for mining, yes. But if AES is indeed solved, it’s probably only solved for a literal handful of people in very high positions that are very rich. BTC would still work if this were true and these *very few* (because if I broke AES I’d be selling that tech on a service by service basis, for a TON of money a shot, to governments and corporations) people would either use it to solve blocks and mine secretly or just stay away from BTC completely because they can make more money for the aforementioned reasons. 
Don’t get me wrong, it’s probably not the case that anyone broke AES, but if it were me, and I solved it, I wouldn’t release that information publicly. I would sell it and profit off it for as long as I can before someone else discovers what I did and releases it to the public. And it goes without saying that I would keep it a secret. Because EVERYONE would want this goose that laid the golden egg.
So it could very well be the case that AES is solved, and no one knows about it yet.

Let’s say he did that though, how does he explain the huge influx of cash suddenly in his bank account? Seems like he was screwed over in multiple ways. If the IRS comes a-knocking he’s gonna have some splainin to do.
@_date: 2019-07-23 04:29:08
Ok, maybe I just know nothing about money laundering, but I never understood how the sheer fact that people suddenly have an influx of millions of dollars in their bank accounts with no reportable income to connect to it get away with that. I mean, sure, I suppose the best guys have legitimate fronts, like a pizza parlor or something, that they can claim a salary from, but it’s not like everyone can have mob-esque front as a cover. I guess people get away with it because they don’t get audited...though I fail to see how someone with a sudden 5000% increase in their yearly earnings doesn’t set off a billion alarms at the IRS.
@_date: 2019-07-23 04:24:36

Yeah I’m sure that works for people with small influxes of cash from their crypto, but for the bigger fish with millions...I highly doubt they are comfortable just keeping all of their cash in a safe somewhere on their property, just begging to be stolen.
@_date: 2019-07-23 08:56:10
The IRS would still wonder where that money is coming from. If you got audited there would be no income source and you’d likely get investigated.

Except you’re not disagreeing with me. You’re saying “watch this documentary that explains how everything will magically work out because I don’t actually know what I’m talking about and can only cite outside sources to make my arguments for me”
Well grats, you watched a documentary that you think (key word there) explains everything because you have no background in economics to understand when it’s making a specious argument, which I can almost guarantee it is. 
People like you are the problem with this world. You think you know everything about something because you lazily watched a doc or took one class in a shitty liberal arts college about a subject far too complex to understand in such a perfunctory manner. 
Go get a real fucking education, then you can argue with me kid. Or at the very least make an *actual* argument. 
And P to the fucking S, you really ought to stop making ignorant statements about Umericans[sic] and their knowledge of other countries that you’ve clearly been spoon fed by your media in order to have a smug, yet false, sense of superiority. The average American is more educated than you’re led to believe about the world. They’re (like everyone else) just brought down by the lowest common denominator of their demographic.

@_date: 2018-09-18 19:40:26
Who said I was American? That’s quite an assumption. It’s also a worse assumption to assert that Americans have no understanding about the world outside of their own country. But if that is what you need in order to feel morally superior then you do you. 
Anyway, good luck getting enough vendors wherever you are to accept unstable virtual currency as payment for their goods. Riots totally won’t happen when the price drops by 50% but everyone expects to purchase everything at the previous exchange rate. 
I really hope it works out, really I do. But unfortunately I know how **global** economies (big emphasis on the word global) actually work instead of watching one documentary and thinking I have a perfect grasp on their enormous complexities. I’m also not living in a delusional hippy dreamland.  
@_date: 2018-09-18 00:01:46
How is this true? Or rather how is this ever going to be true?
Now before you give me the “once the price stabilizes” speech please consider for a moment how it’s the biggest assumption in crypto currency right now that this will eventually just magically occur. And I say magically because it really seems like that’s what it’s going to take to stabilize the price of btc enough for people to ever have confidence enough to use it over fiat. 
The reason fiat currency is generally stable (obviously depending on the stability of the country that issues it) is because there are regulations and oversight. This kind of oversight is impossible to implement with btc however because it contradicts the very nature of what the coin is supposed to represent. 
And you can say “oh well it will be used in economically unstable countries like Venezuela,” but really think about the stupidity of that statement for a moment. If a country is so economically unstable that it’s currency is inflated several thousand percent you expect people to be able to get their act together (while they are frantically trying to survive) and set up an infrastructure where vendors of goods accept btc? It’s ludicrous!
So please...someone explain to me how this will ever replace fiat currency.
@_date: 2018-09-18 03:39:00
How can you call fiat currency fake and bitcoin real?
They are both artificially assigned value based on confidence. Both are equally fake in that regard. But since people have more confidence in fiat currency and it’s value is subject to government regulation and it has things like federal assurance it’s certainly more real and stable than bitcoin is. 
Why would I buy bitcoin right now to use as currency for purchasing things? It’s value fluctuates constantly and it could literally be 10% (or more) less valuable 10 seconds after purchasing it (not that I can actually USE my btc right after I purchase it since coinbase takes several days to a week to process), so I could very easily lose money before I even make my purchase. But if I do it with fiat currency I’ll always have exactly what I have and unless the price of what I’m purchasing goes up there’s no chance of me having to spend extra money on the item based on the whims of the market. 
Until btc is regulated and thus stable enough to not fluctuate at the whim of market manipulation (and don’t let anyone fool you, this is going on CONSTANTLY), which will NEVER happen because it will undermine the very purpose of btc, the only thing it will ever be good for is gambling. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:49:41
The worst kind of arrogance is when it’s paired with complete idiocy...that’s you bud. 
First of all, I’m not using any strawman arguments, I’m simply responding directly to what you say or at the very least what you are heavily implying, perhaps I’m using some “creative” licensing in my interpretation of your statements but considering the garish way you refer to Americans I really don’t think I’m far off. 
Again, why the assumption that I am American? ‘It’s so fucking hilarious that you keep calling me an American with such stupid assurance when you’re absolutely and utterly incorrect. I don’t know what led you to make that assumption in the first place but the more you continue to insult me for being this “Umerican” the more you continue to prove your own ignorance. 
When you say “for the first time in history we know who they are” I can only assume you’re referring to Trump. If that’s indeed the case you are again showing your complete and total ignorance of the nuances of both the American psyche and their political system. 
First of all, Hilary Clinton won the popular vote, meaning, for the layperson such as yourself, more Americans voted for Hilary than Trump. Trump only won the election because of the outdated electoral college system which essentially allows states with lower populations to have more representation as voting bodies than they should (and before you go on an idiotic tirade about how stupid Americans are for allowing such a system to exist do keep in mind that no political system is perfect and the very nature of the system that protects it from undesirable changes, which is a good thing, also unfortunately makes it difficult to change things that need to be changed).
Secondly, many trump voters (even though they are the national minority), were one-issue voters (such as in immigration) and fully acknowledge the idiot he is and the he doesn’t represent many of their views; he was, for them, unfortunately the lesser of the two evils. 
Honestly I could respond to the rest of your ridiculous ad hominem attacks and trolling but it’s just not worth it, and it’s a complete waste of my valuable time. Nothing I say is actually going to get through to you and you should consider yourself fortunate I’ve dedicated any amount of my time and energy to converse with an uneducated nothing like you.

So what happens to BTC transactions when there’s no longer an incentive for miners to mine because it would take too long to mine a single coin? How does the ledger get verified if no one mines anymore?
The price has to go up along with difficulty of mining right? So either BTC’s value steadily climbs to compensate for mining smaller and smaller amounts or the currency dies?

Yeah, maybe the value will go up and holding is the best decision, but this isn’t a pro-social post, it’s an attempt to shill a philosophy that supports how this particular individual wants to use their crypto because they are irresponsible with their money.

And it’s ridiculously stupid replies like these that are hindering progress. 
How do I know? I don’t. But I’m not the only one that thinks this. Plenty of financial experts are saying he exact same thing, so if you want to call them stupid go right ahead but I guarantee they know more about the space than you do. I’d also be willing to bet I know more about it than you. 
You’re making the assumption that the market will always be as it is today. If you look at historical trends there are plenty of cases when fiat currencies were very unstable and easily manipulated. No one is claiming that the crypto of today is stable enough for people in countries with failing economic systems to rely on it, that is a straw man argument. 
However, many are fairly certain that it will one day stabilize once the technology has developed enough and it will be a realistic alternative to fiat currency. The space is still very new and it would be foolish to judge it based on its present state. 
Your mindset is toxic to innovation and progress. Imagine if, when computers were invented, no one saw them as anything other than room-sized tools for solving mathematical equations or processing financial data. What kind of world would we be living in today? So call my notions “foolish” and “ridiculous” if you want, but just remember that literally every genius and innovator in history was called that at some point by the vapid and the forgotten masses.

I think the whole point is actually thanking coinbase in this case. I originally misread it and thought he was being sarcastic, but he really is thanking them.

I’m not really worried about it as I mostly invested in projects that I believe in, like Golem. No matter what the overall market looks like, coins that have high value propositions will generally do well in the long term (assuming the projects succeed). 
Bitcoin may be the standard right now but it’s literally a shitcoin at this moment as it doesn’t really have any relevant technology backing it; it’s only intrinsic value is what people say it’s worth. It may have originated the Blockchain, but since then it has evolved and other coins (Ethereum) have become the new standard for the technology. 
I switched over my BTC to ETH yesterday as it’s become clear to me that ETH is becoming the new standard. It makes perfect sense when you think about it, the majority of altcoins use the Ethereum Blockchain, and smart contracts are the new tech to watch out for.

Pretty much the same. Bought at 15k then the crash happened and I lost like 5K before it got into my account.

Im wondering...
Maybe this is a stupid question, but I’m looking at the buy/sell order book for bitcoin and I’m seeing A lot of 
.001 transactions being made on both ends. 
Theoretically, if one wanted to crash the market, couldn’t they just set up two accounts to buy/sell btc to each other at slowly decreasing rates in an attempt to drive the overall market down?
Is that what’s going on?
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:37:06
Riiiiight...but the price he originally bought btc at was locked in. He would have been screwed over either way. If he got the money immediately it still would have crashed and he would be in the same boat.

Yes, because an industry where there’s only one “investment choice” (BTC) is a healthy one. I literally have no idea what you’re trying to say.
Also, that’s just how markets move, and always have moved. New innovation always has and always will drive markets and investments, it’s healthy and normal. It’s just the truth that there are better coins out there than BTC.

What is this rule that there has to be one main coin? That’s like saying there can only be one main clothing brand, or one main restaurant. ETH has proven itself quite sufficiently to take itself out of “altcoin” status.
It’s funny that you mention history because that’s exactly what I’m using to make my analysis. There’s always an industry standard, then a newer better product or service comes and replaces it. But you’re saying that won’t happen with crypto?! If we actually let history tell the story then it’s somewhat likely that it will happen eventually. Why not begin with bitcoin? It’s initial inherent value was the Blockchain technology, but since other coins have picked up the tech and flourished they’ve proven that they no longer need bitcoin to exist. The only reason it continues to is that it was the industry leader for so long and people still assign an arbitrary value to it without really looking at the technology. Once people become more aware of the actual technology behind it and other coins this may change. Maybe that’s what’s happening now?
Im not saying ETH is the new standard or, if it becomes the new standard, it will always remain the standard, but it certainly looks like it will be a stronger and less volatile coin than BTC given the recent 3-6 month trend. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:37:31
They are so very wrong. 
ETH is the new standard. Most altcoins use ETH Blockchain.
You can even see this by looking at the 3 month curve. ETH has a very healthy normal curve while BTC is humping. It could be that BTC hump is part of a much larger (6 or so month) trend and we’re seeing the 50% mark and there will be a correction soon, but honestly ETH seems so much stronger as BTC isn’t technologically competitive anymore.

You’re talking about apples and oranges here. 
Crypto currencies are not stocks. 
Just because it took 6 years for NASDAQ to recover doesn’t mean the same will occur in this space. This is particularly true because of the nature of the crash. People are panicking because of the Korea/China uncertainty (not so much Korea anymore), but once they realize that the technology isn’t going anywhere and it’s going to be utilized in many new domains in completely new ways the market will likely recover..,quickly. 
Not to mention cryptocurrencies give many people in unstable countries the ability to control their own economy, rather than their government control it for them. That alone, once it catches on, will be enough to send crypto to unimaginable heights.

Yes, but it’s also difficult to build a long term portfolio with only a fraction of a BTC if you don’t have the money.
Unless BTC goes over 100K you don’t really have much money in the end, and with all the resistance at different support levels lately it’s very likely that’s not going to happen for quite a few years, if it ever occurs at all.
Various altcoins (like ADA) are better posed to be the future of crypto currency and are very likely to become a standard as they have significantly better technology behind them. 
It’s like betting on Cassette tapes after CDs and MDs were introduced, no one knew which would become the standard, but people were pretty sure it wasn’t going to be cassette tapes. Ultimately CDs and MDs failed as well, but they would have done well enough in their time to make a hypothetical investor (if you invested in companies behind their creation, don’t know if any actually existed) a good return if they knew when to switch over to MP4 related tech (not a perfect analogy as I don’t know if any companies that focused on the development and profit of this tech existed, but you get the point). 
Having said that, it’s not idiocy to keep some of your money in BTC, I’d highly recommend holding 1 in your portfolio if you can afford it, but many alts are better poised to be the wave of the future.
