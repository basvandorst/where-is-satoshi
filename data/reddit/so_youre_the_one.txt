We need a book. The white paper should be in it for sure. Probably also every thread Satoshi ever commented in too

Looked just now, it was not helpful at all
@_date: 2014-09-27 01:34:29
Nope, seems helpful though. Thanks!

Yeah, I'm looking for more stuff like: 
articles on taxes (and theft) would be great

I'm relatively well versed in economics and markedly less so in computer science, I just haven't seen anywhere where my input would be helpful thus far. Granted, I've only been subscribed for about a week or so

As long as you don't need them quickly (less than a week). Although some people have had problems, I've made four purchases over the past couple months without any hassle. This is assuming you are purchasing from them before they hit the daily limit. Although the exchange rate has been stable, bitcoin has historically been a volatile currency so take care with the decision to buy at market price in 5 days. I'd play it safe and only buy at a guaranteed rate.

Bitcoin is a currency (like cash) that can be transfered in minutes in an irreversible transaction between (potentially) anonymous parties. Transfers happen over the internet so money can be sent around the globe with unprecedented speed. Bitcoin is acquired through a regulated, limited creation mechanism known as "mining" or through trade of currency or of goods or services. The total value of all bitcoins is in the low billions (1 or 2) of USD [citation needed]. The currency has wide adoption among libertarians, cyber criminals, and those who seek the quick and easy flow of capital. The last group although up and coming, is the most important and where the currency will truly live up to its potential as a global  powerhouse. Not only does the flow of money involve bankers, corporations, and businessmen; it has the power to revolutionize everyday transactions with fees lower than credit cards allowing small business owners to reclaim a significant portion of lost revenue from the likes of Visa and Mastercard.
Although bitcoin can survive amongst true believers, it will thrive in the flow of capital and the support of the masses. (this point is a little bit preachy but I felt it deserved inclusion)
