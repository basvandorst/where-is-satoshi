I sent BTC from GDAX 5 hours ago and it hasn’t arrived yet.  So relax, GDAX is slow

Yes gdax is not there anymore and is replaced by Coinbase pro.
I know they could’ve done a redirect, but they haven’t.

Is this shit going to increase the volatility even more.  I remember prior to December 2017 there was another futures exchange being commissioned in US and that didn’t go well and it’s curse caused a massive dip.

Great List.  Thank you.

For as long as it says pending, it’s not lost so just wait.
Last few days the withdraw from GDAX is rediculously slow.
In Coinbase if you click on that transaction, you will get a mini popup with address.  Click on wallet address and it should take you to Live BlockCypher.
When you have more than 3/6+ confirmations, that’s when it may start to show in your receiving wallet.

No because when you HODL, you will always have those coins and you are not going to lose them when you HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:37:49
I noticed that coinbase recently charging 16 dollars for any amount of BTC withdrawal.  
Deposit the same amount from Coinbase to GDAX and from there to the where you originally want to send it to and GDAX won't charge you any fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:18:43
I agree.  As I said BCash is managed by “developers” instead of “engineers”.  These devs are like obedient developers that lack critical thinking and their non-techy managers (Roger) barks at them technical solutions and these ignorant and stupid obedient developers apply the changes without challenging it without any innovative thought process.

US government, who?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:51:39
Don't you love it when American *Financial Experts* and *Bankers* are somehow under illusion that Bitcoin is only something that happens in US and that the US government is going to do something about it.

Withdrawal from GDAX is ridiculously slow these days.  You should be able to see that status of the transaction in CoinBase as well as Coinbase keep the withdrawal history even if it was actioned in GDAX.
Check it in Coinbase to see if it says ‘Pending’ or ‘Completed’
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:02:31
BCash is shitty software developers’ and non-techy people’s solution to a serious problem.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:35:42
Check the receiving address and the status of transaction on blockchypher

If it falls to pennies, I might buy some.

Coinbase doesn’t have support at all.  They only have an auto generated email system.

They don’t have all their BTC in their trade book.  The shard it across multiple cold wallets and programmatically move some back to trade book on need bases.

More decentralised exchanges please.  These clowns should have no access to people’s wallets

Maybe I will, I already did it with Kraken only a couple of days ago.  Thanks for your beneficial contribution.

Hodling is the best investment/trading strategy compare to day trading.  Just hodl.

Because you are the one.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:32:06
Thank you.  I thought that if that number is high, it will mean that there is more of the coins available in the market and hence the prices will be low.  However based on what I have observed, as the "Volume" increases, so does the price of coin and when the volume decreases so does the price of coin. That is odd, I thought it will be the other way round as when there is more of a product available in a market, the prices will go down.  I am still learning so hopefully one day I will be able to see and make sense of all this.

@_date: 2017-11-25 10:30:49
I believe it also depends on the location of the exchange itself.  Remember that Dollar has different value in different geographic locations.  So if you sell it in one exchange to US dollars and transfer your dollar to another region then the prices will match and balance out

That is one of Kraken's feature and not a defect or bug.

True.  It is difficult to tell if the error is just UI layer or full backend error affecting the actual placement of orders.

Temporarily yes.  Proper fucked.  But don’t worry, the king will rise and so will his concubines.

Pffft.  As if the other coins are doing any better.
