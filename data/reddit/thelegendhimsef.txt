Yes and the rationale for some of the swings. I understand blockchain from a developers standpoint as I majored in Computer Science with a concentration in Deep Learning so I quickly educated myself on the processes and the way the thing works from a Fundamental standpoint. I’m more so trying to understand the investment side. I’m set on on the tools to use like a wallet, actual crypto exchanges vs standard coin base Robinhood etc.  but it just seems more difficult to predict swings without **accurate information.** I guess that’s the part I ‘m looking for, that type or indicative information. Does it come from blogs?Those newsletters? Because while a good amount can come from the git and YouTube and our subreddit sources, there is still more information to be obtained. Just a data freak really sorry haha. While I dont obsess over my investment I do obsess on gaining as much knowledge about something as I can.
