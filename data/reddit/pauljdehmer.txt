when you setup your 2fa they provide you with a key (usually a qr code). backup that key.
also sometimes they'll provide one time use passwords that you can backup on something besides your phone.

all good points.
maybe he didn't anticipate how revolutionary bitcoin could be when he wrote the white paper, or maybe he did, and wanted the white paper to be free of political charge, logically explaining the problems and solutions required for the system to work.
honestly my analysis was after reading the white paper alone. after reading more of his posts, he does seem to be a bit more politically motivated.

He seems to have solved the reversible transaction problem, but yes, the cost for the blockchain as the "trusted third party" just goes to the miners in the form of transaction fees, unfortunately keeping micro transactions to a minimum. However it can be argued that the costs (transaction fees) are lower than the current system due to the lack of mediation in fraud attempts.

i see nowhere in his paper that he claims anything remotely close to "the overseers" being hostile to potential change. he argues only against cost, and fraud in the form of reversible transactions in the current system. reading "hostile" into that is a stretch if you ask me.
transparency of transactions is a fortunate byproduct of decentralization and open source, although i don't think this was his main motivation. without everyone knowing every transaction that takes place (decentralization), and knowing how to verify that it's correct (open source), the system wouldn't work.
he was definitely a proponent of anti-transparency (anonymity) when it comes to personal identification linked to a transaction. he specifically has a section titled "privacy" in the paper.
