I feel that price predictions on something like this are pure gambling. Let's take a look back a few years. I remember selling a ton when we broke the $10 milestone, same with the $20 one, $100, $500, December 2013 $1300 milestone. That's the beauty of it. If you told me back in 2012 that BTC would be trading at $4000 in such a short time, I'd have probably laughed at you. We are living in exciting times.

Definitely! Looking back on it and going through the logs I still have available I'd say you were pretty spot on. The earliest of days were pretty funny looking back on it. I remember Butterfly Labs ripping everyone off, the Pizza, CPU-&gt;GPU-&gt;FPGA-&gt;ASIC mining. Good times. 
I'll definitely check that site out.

I remember when I initially got into bitcoin it was worth almost nothing. These were the early days when you could mine a few BTC a day. Anyways, I went to college with a guy who was otherwise brilliant; he told me it would never take off. $5? Nope. $10? Nope. $20? Still nope. $120? Still a scam. $500? Yeah definitely not. $1000? You just got lucky buddy. When we almost hit $5000 I just wished I could have seen his reaction. He still thinks it's a scam. 
I invested $2000 or so in hardware back in the day to mine (multiple 7970s), that $2000 investment + power was paid off a significant number of times over in the recent years. Can't convince everyone.

I was not a long term hodler back then. At one point I sold 40 a piece. Circa Dec 2013 I sold 50 and bought a new Porsche Cayman spring 2014. Nowadays I hodl, but back then it was all about getting the currency accepted. Kinda pissed though since I have a wallet with a bunch of coins protected by a malfunctioning yubikey that won't unlock. 
Did I have 1000BTC? No. Close to that? Probably held 250~300 at once at one time. Nowadays it's nowhere near that but I'm hodling on to what I've got while keeping a wallet around with a couple for spending.
