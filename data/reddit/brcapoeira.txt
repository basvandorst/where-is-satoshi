but if you want escrow, you are forced.

most will always at least do 2 exchanges, unless they depoist or withdraw fiat.
and yes, it realy sucks. I used to use it to hedge my Bitcoin. But the new fees are so high that I will use futures or Tether in the future
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:32:57
good starting point, but still no count where I can easily see how much coins are stolen in total.
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:30:08
somebody hacks a onlinebanking, buys coins from you. you recieve the transaction, free the coins for him. 1 or 2 days later you got a chargeback in your bankaccount.
@_date: 2016-08-11 13:48:50
for alttrading it's perfect. all cryptopairs should be traded there.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:13:09
I don't know this specific microfone, but generaly the directivity of the acoustic membrane of a condenser microphone is perpendicular to the microfone axis.
and it indeed sounds like all the high frequencies are somehow missing.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:53:11
have fun with chargebacks
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:36:29
The automatic conversion is actualy a market order at Finex? are there the same fees?
@_date: 2015-06-22 00:18:48
which communism do you refer to?
in general communism is stateless, socialism (with a strong state) is the learning phase that teaches society how to live without a state.
@_date: 2015-06-21 20:52:05
communism is stateless
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:02:29
have a look at Tether

thread on Bitcointalk:: 
@_date: 2014-09-20 04:45:16
the capitulation man ...lol.......but seriously: you seam to get notified about replys....how can I do this?
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:50:33
I guess you will have a big surprise
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:48:33
in a falling market this sounds very, very bad
@_date: 2014-08-25 19:09:37
I read 500-600k but i'm not sure...maybe you find the info here: 
@_date: 2014-05-16 00:00:12
that is in $
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:05:57
FXOpen is a huge and famous broker......the others, I agree
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:17:14
and Dark is still number 1 atm
@_date: 2014-09-20 04:05:56
how you get notified about responses? never found that out on reddit
@_date: 2014-09-07 19:58:52
volume IS volume
@_date: 2014-09-11 11:09:09


that's EXACTLY the point the "gamblers" forget
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:22:54
no, with one miilion you can invest in something stable and live a good life
@_date: 2014-08-23 19:07:50
@_date: 2014-08-16 20:07:10
they obviously bought a license
@_date: 2014-09-07 18:54:20
it's a game. if you are a "believer" you could easily bet on "more than$1000"
@_date: 2014-09-03 19:23:14
the coin: less
the concept of crytpocurencys (read: without centralizing ideologies): 100% 
@_date: 2014-08-16 20:06:32


I didn't understand
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:30:14
I'm not libertarian
@_date: 2014-05-15 18:29:57


good is relative....at least you can keep it more or less stable, while deflation is devasting
@_date: 2014-09-01 19:20:59
software was updated....but still no english
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:23:47
well, this is some....acording to "Occam's razor" this is the truth
@_date: 2014-09-21 01:30:02
economists always remind me of the geocentric model. none of them have a real clue yet....they have a main variable wrong 
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:10:32
free market hahahah
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:06:17
it's not volume....it's number of negociations...this is from MT4
@_date: 2014-05-16 13:01:56
i see
@_date: 2014-08-15 14:27:17
you guys are funny :-)
@_date: 2014-09-09 02:59:09
what would be better ranges?
@_date: 2014-09-07 22:57:35
currently the two betters have almost 100% gain on payout if they win
@_date: 2014-05-15 22:37:38
I'm not saying it wil stay there. obviously this volume is "bubble-generated"
@_date: 2014-09-21 14:08:30
that sums it up
@_date: 2014-10-17 00:54:33
anarchism is not (only) defined by the absence of state (btw, comunism is stateless, too)
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:29:41
it is probably very easy for an investor that big
@_date: 2014-08-16 20:11:33
also one has to point this out:
webplatform doesn't provide advanced orders like stoplosses. who will play 10x futures overnight without stoploss?
plus, pages like TradingView don't povide OkCoin charts.
this, plus many more, would provide TradeStation to us.
@_date: 2014-09-02 01:17:51
remember that one?
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:21:50
damn, if I had 100m i'll send you some to make you feel better
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:28:43
look what i said. "only acceptable"
those CFDs have ridiculous conditions
@_date: 2014-08-16 16:30:39
what you expect? lol it's about the stages. yes, there is one more
@_date: 2014-10-17 11:45:11
all 3 are utopias (and so I'm not defending any), BUT don't confuse realworld-socialism with communism. the theory doesn't have the "more equals"
@_date: 2014-05-16 11:51:50
not sure if responding to me or to Aahzmundus. trading volume is not the same as transfer volume
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:51:41
I don't know for what those comparisons are usefull if they don't compare to the rise of income of the avarege person
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:02:58
check also my topic with other forex brokers....ONCE AGAIN, like all the others, they don't mention the exchange rate and spread...will send email and add to list 
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:17:42
funny topic
@_date: 2014-05-15 22:35:31
24h is 24h
@_date: 2014-09-19 10:00:26
I have warned you
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:34:07
well, the big problem of BTC is the idiologic centralization. no more anacaps left to join
@_date: 2014-05-15 22:36:11
move around coins? that is not volume
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:31:51
like 99% of this earth lol
@_date: 2014-09-20 05:21:00
I don't lol...never got message here
@_date: 2014-09-06 17:02:56
Risk "all of nothing"? lol
@_date: 2014-09-06 11:25:27
you only hear about the winners of the "risk it all" strategie....the majority obviously is poor as fuck, on the street or killed themselfs
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:04:54
one got all coins: 
must be a Chinese, i tell ya hahahahhaha
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:22:14
dont forget they are partner with FXOpen too. and FXOpen has a name in forex
@_date: 2014-09-06 16:28:09

@_date: 2014-08-14 15:24:39

@_date: 2014-08-31 23:59:32
good one
@_date: 2014-08-17 13:24:58
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:06:26
so here it is: 
@_date: 2014-09-07 14:19:10
because this is USD volume. see here CAD: 
@_date: 2014-09-06 11:32:47
so: Bitcoin is for cryptos what DOS is for computers.
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:54:44
BTC should be in Formula E
@_date: 2014-09-20 03:56:25
now you believe it?
@_date: 2014-07-15 00:45:43
but wouldn´ t be the ltc/btc realtion be true anyways, if this is true?
@_date: 2014-08-16 23:19:31
nice, i had sent him this topic allready
@_date: 2014-05-15 23:59:41
in $
@_date: 2014-05-15 23:57:01
it is trading volume
@_date: 2014-08-16 17:34:29
well, they made okcoin.com for westerners
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:30:47
what are insubstantial posts? can you send me a link describing it? I realy don't understand what I can post at all.
@_date: 2014-09-15 09:54:00
Bitcoin should be in Formula E
@_date: 2014-09-20 04:05:16
I guess nobody believes in me :-(
@_date: 2014-09-19 09:48:21
we are talking about the price, my friend
@_date: 2014-05-15 10:38:25
It might just work, or destroy world economy &gt; caos &gt; wars
@_date: 2014-09-06 11:29:05
correct........and would mainly be in a bar
@_date: 2014-09-04 12:12:52
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:12:40
me? you guys are good at "argumentum ad hominem" only
@_date: 2014-09-19 00:25:39
what safed it back there? must have been something fundamental or an organized pump......and what could safe it this time?
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:37:25
forexpeacearmy is a very good place to check this
@_date: 2014-08-17 18:50:51
nice...thanks a lot
@_date: 2014-08-16 20:08:23
here is the email I had sent him:
I'm an active user/tester of OkCoin.com, and I really like the options your web page gives us traders.
I also got very exited when I found out that we can us Tradestation to trade on OkCoin: 
As a former Forextrader I'm used to this kind of platform, and know about the many advantages it gives us traders comparing to a web-based platform.
Unfortunately I than found out that this is only available in Chinese.
After talking to other fellow traders on TradingView.com, we joined a chat-group there of traders which are testing OkCOin's Futures, many of them asked me to send this email to you, because we would really like to be able to use this platform, too (as non Chinese).
Tradestation software is originally in English, so obviously a translation wouldn't be necessary. It shouldn´t be hard to make it available in English.
Could you please have a look at this? 
@_date: 2014-08-16 16:38:15
I'm hoping for  to respond.
I allready sent him an email, but no response
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:04:24
focus on your internal, ignore external things. If you are golden inside, you shine golden to the outside.
@_date: 2014-05-15 23:58:41
man, I found it impressive......in 24h more DRK where traded than BTC....BTC allready took the lead again actually
@_date: 2014-03-08 11:59:59
only that the only aceptable option is FxOpen, which is on the same server as BTC-E's Mt4, which had a lot of problems recently
@_date: 2014-08-16 20:41:05
could you test their "version"?
@_date: 2014-08-25 19:23:00
do you need many? if BTC community were there it were allready enough
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:35:58
how you dare to say that in this forum? hahaha
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:53:14
this year: yes
+ money supply growth of BTC is over 13%, too for last 365 days
@_date: 2014-10-16 19:13:20
libertarian to anarchist
@_date: 2015-05-26 11:31:46
I ask: why should it take off here?
there is no real utility 
@_date: 2014-02-22 22:07:42
how did this 1 year old thread come to the top?
ooooh wait....
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:50:03
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:51:54
pragmatism is not well seen here
@_date: 2015-07-09 11:26:45
almost dubbled now
@_date: 2017-04-18 17:24:14
makes sense
@_date: 2017-04-18 10:46:27
what about Tether? also blocked?
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:38:53
it does mean something though. someone wants to read opinions this time
@_date: 2015-03-23 18:05:50
revolution doesn't have to be bloody.....think of a party who comprimises itself to always vote acording to the online votes in congress. it could than grow bigger and bigger.
@_date: 2015-03-23 18:02:56
implementation of the blockchain: 
@_date: 2016-05-05 00:53:22
you guys will make him so angry that in the end he will dump 1m coins just for revenge lol
@_date: 2016-05-05 10:53:32
in your perfect Bitcoin world perhaps. in fact price could go way below $100 and not get over it again.
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:44:05
does this have alerts? I always wanted alerts for confirmations on a transaction anyways
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:57:13
so the explanation for all this in the end can only be 2:
1) he is completly insane
2) he is Satoshi, a very weired guy
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:49:36
I guess Jesus would first anounce his comeback without a proof, let people get confortable with the possibility that it is him, than he would anounce that he will transform a stone into e bread, and than later would do it. lol
@_date: 2016-05-05 01:44:26
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:54:40
so there is a new anouncement. BCC price wont be added to the contracts index prices:
so if you have hedged Bitcoin there you have riskfree BCC for free afterwards, right?
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:55:35
so, were they reported to FinCEN and FCA? 
is there anybody who realy got scammed?
@_date: 2016-07-30 01:51:04
yea. it would cost some time to do all the math. what I think however is that if they were insolvent, with all the transpendency, the whole comunity would know. many people would have done the math, not just one single reddit rookie account. also I read about a "fight" with Andreanopolis (forgot his name). Did he or his fans did the math and found out they are?
@_date: 2016-07-29 09:53:27
can you give an example? I've used them a lot and never had a problem
@_date: 2016-07-29 12:07:14
still they have no spread though
@_date: 2016-07-30 01:58:12
I asked their support and they confirmed that this is correct. they also sent me a longer text with an explanation.
@_date: 2016-07-29 19:49:17
"The Reddit poster then posted an update claiming that Uphold is solvent, stating: “It’s good to see my reddit post helped the company return to a surplus, reassuring they can pay customers if they demanded their assets out of their network.”
The poster’s update said they considered Uphold solvent, indicating they accepted Uphold’s explanation for listing VOX among its assets."
@_date: 2016-07-29 09:53:04

cool, but that isn't real P2P isn't it?
@_date: 2013-09-11 22:05:59


away from Facebook? wouldn't this be great?
@_date: 2013-08-24 00:26:57
wait, this is on for weeks (months?)....and atm trading is not possible.....also it's actually 10:1
@_date: 2013-09-11 17:19:11
I had the ideia of a P2P social network some time ago.....but I don't have the knowledge and recources do do it
@_date: 2013-09-20 02:44:29
confusing? you can add or remove things.
they said they will add Bitstamp, but i don't know when.
best chart for Stamp atm is this one: 
very limited though
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:42:42
funny how the article mentions 44% liberals in comunity and this at the moment has 44% downvotes. hahahahahhahaa
@_date: 2013-06-19 21:53:51
thanks from Brazil
@_date: 2013-06-20 14:49:09
don't be stupid, any other form probably becomes a dictatorship
@_date: 2013-09-12 02:09:22
THIS looks better: 
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:57:04
I asked support:
"Dear Client,
Please, be advised, Bitcoins in your Demo account are available for analysis only. Unfortunately, the company doesn’t provide Bitcoin pair for trading. If anything changes, the news will be published on company web site.
Best Regards,
FXOpen Team"
@_date: 2013-06-18 18:18:16
this is to my fellow Brazilians, so excuse me if I'll write in portuguese.
começo com uma pergunta:
existem ideias de um modelo de uma forma de democracia direta independente atras de uma rede p2p?
Que tal o Bitpartido?
