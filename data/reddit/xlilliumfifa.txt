Seems legit tbh
I truly appreciate
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:07:23
I'm a long time HODLer and yes it's the first time since I'm losing faith in BTC tbh. I feel good for you, you did a sage thing !
I've only been lookin' at alts for a short time, but it looks promising to be honest ! Enjoy a happy Crypto 2018 !

Does me posting this had an influence over the sudden confirmations?
Anyway, I'm glad I didn't fuck up my transaction, thanks a lot

Hey mate,
It was my first withdrawal ever on Kraken and I was tier 3 something so it was pretty weird...
I escalated my ticket via the google form available on their twitter support and my account got unlocked yesterday, I could withdraw everything without further issues

I'm here with you, but lately I feel some other coins offers you just as much freedom, if not more (privacy etc..)
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:38:51
Okay mate, thanks !
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:14:58
edited to take it off.. It's just been so hyped up lately that it's became indescent to say it's name.... Would it be possible to comment about the post though?
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:27:34
I don't see anything missing on the program, but since I'm a noob I wouldn't be able to help anyway.
What I'm missing though is a Free Invite to your course in my inbox !!
Haha jk, tbh that's a great idea you got, best of luck to you mate !

Hi guys,
I'm stocking bitcoin on an Electrum local wallet, I did nothing since the fork.
Do I have BTC + BCH now or is it still only BTC ? If it's BTC + BCH, what should I do to enjoy them both?
Sorry for the late question ! I appreciate y'all help
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:38:31
That's the actual opposite... I'm more than confident in Bitcoin.
I can afford to lose it all, but I do not intend to !
The reason why I need legit numbers is to convince my family mostly ! If I'd have all that money myself, It'd already be in Bitcoin !
Honestly I'm kinda disappointed on how the answers thus far has been pretty patronizing... I'm just asking for help about numbers, the rest is under control :(
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:19:58
It's all good my man, I get it, I appreciate the concern anyway
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:18:30
Well.. Thing is that, the only way for me to invest this much of money  is by borrowing it. Meaning I will have to reimburse it really fast, I cannot allow myself to have a loan for more than 3 months, so fees are gettin' tricky for me
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:00:46
Ok Einstein you're a genius. Next time you intend to be useless, please don't do it on one of my posts, or at least stay on topic :(
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:19:22
So, I want my simulation to be quite precise.
If I expect to make only 2K profit, a "few hundred Euros" are a big deal to me
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:23:31
I've been doing that for 3 years now, and right now I'm okay to take the risk of the BTC suddenly dipping.
I'm planning on a real short term plan, I know all the risks, the bad ethic  etc... But what I want right now is a financial situation to really think about doing it. I'm truly NOT SURE at all that I'm gonna do it even if the financial simulation is optimistic, I'm gonna have to talk with friends, family etc before that, I'm way aware of all that, I just want the numbers right :(
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:39:19
Thanks mate, I appreciate your concern though ! Good luck to you as well !
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:21:15
I could afford to pay the loan back, but let's say I don't want to spend my personal money on it
And, the loan is a 1% tax, I feel like it's a golden occasion
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:12:57
Yes I would been able to pay it back if I lost it all.
And I'm looking to get my EUR amount kind of the quickest way possible, I'm lookin' for a "small" profit right here
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:59:26
First useful answer out here... I thank you a lot my man.
So it would be about ~1 hundred euros "lost" in the process. It is indeed nothing compared to gains ! Now time to check the government fiscality !
I'm really thankful for your answer, have a great day my man 
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:09:17
Nahh, as I said before, even if I lost it all I'd still be able to refund the loan with some money I got on some other place, I just don't want to move that last money on BTC because it's already in a great place, but I could if needed
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:36:32
Is it a good one ??
I think it's time for me to get one.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:40:32
Great, thanks for this.
I was hesitating with a Trezor bitcoin wallet, but Imma go with Ledger then.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:32:07


That means, if I stock them on an Electrum wallet on my laptop, they're safe ?
