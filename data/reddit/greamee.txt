I-I-I don't know Rick... 
What if "Bitcoin" is an idea, a protocol?

What do you believe their plan is? Wouldn't it make way more sense for the exit scam to have taken place in November or December?

Eh like that would solve anything. The r btc page would still link to a pro BCH subreddit.

Try moving a community of 100,000 people to another subreddit...

All coins are up ∞% since they were launched...
Where on earth did you get the 482% from?
@_date: 2018-08-16 11:12:48
Hmm I dunno, that'd be more like ~~100%~~ 130% up. The value was around ~~3.5k back in September~~ 2.7k back in August.

1) Improved privacy 
2) Ability to spot consensus rule changes.
3) (only if configured) Serve SPV users

I'm not saying BTC should get bigger blocks?
The comment I was replying to claims:


In order to judge that claim, we must define what "*Bitcoin could on-chain without sacrificing decentralization."*
My guess was 15 tps based on 8MB blocks.
Dunno, just an educated guess. It must **at least** be 4 MB because that's what Segwit allows. So I'm unsure why you're responding the way you are.

Let's do an estimate. I say 8MB blocks probably wouldn't sacrifice decentralization right now.
8MB -&gt; \~15 tps
15×100 = 1500 tps
Basically the guy you're responding to says LN can serve 100-500 million people and do 1500 tps **without sacrificing decentralization.**
Yet, the current LN has a capacity of 1.5 million (0,0019% of Bitcoin's market cap).
Lemme upgrade your comment:
\[CITATION MOST DEFINITELY NEEDED\]

Why do you want to send that block to 7 peers within 30 seconds necessarily?
I think 8MB is accurate as far as not impacting currently running full nodes goes. You can easily scale back to 4 peers, or take 1 min to send the blocks.
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:14:47
I was just estimating which blocksize wouldn't affect decentralization.
What would you guess is the appropriate limit then?
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:02:26
You realize a full 4MB segwit block would also require 7.5 mbit according to your calculations right?
Why is my 8MB guess so crazy?
