Hey has bit coin allready topped out or is it going to fall significantly soon? I have some money but fear it's a wasted concept. It won't sky rocket again .

I think everyone should take time to read these comments. These comets are why reddit is great. It's a place for anonymous people to voice their opinion. Then people vote if they like it or not.
This is the quintessential meaning of democracy and you will never get crazy ass points of view at the top. 
Reddit is the meaning of progresive.
We can voice opinions that we could never say in public or to friends. And we can see the support.

Thays awesome thanks. I think I'll start with 200 as per your suggestion. I have always been interested in trading and I like the idea of bit coin. So I think I'm going to d able as a hobby!

I dunno man. Each of you ideas are really cool and unique. They would also attract more users. They really need to read this post and just pick a few to try out. 
I really like your reddit locals idea. And have an easy opt out if you think it's creepy. 
I think it's be fun to go split a pizza or smash tournament with some reddit dudes.
