Nope, literally zero intrinsic value. Completely relies on rampant speculation, irrational exuberance, and the greater fool theory.

What a tool. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:33:41
Nah, still not at zero

Not even. At least stocks in a company have the company and whatever it does to give the stocks some value.

So, basically you’re saying it comes down to faith. ...and you’re basically arguing for blockchain technology (immutable transactions history, transactional tech), not bitcoin itself. 
Maybe look up the meaning of the word fungible. Bitcoin has been stolen and confiscated in the past, but more importantly, it can always be made illegal, or simply superseded by something more practical and useable. 
Good luck with the inevitable crash, I honestly hope you haven’t put all your money into this speculative bubble of intrinsically worthless smoke and mirrors.

...” but everyone (even those in this community) struggle in understanding the intrinsic value of Bitcoin. “
Yeah, because there is none. 
If you actually know the meaning of the word intrinsic, pretty please explain the intrinsic value of bitcoin (and while you’re at it, as opposed to every other crypto-coin/ currency) as distinct from blockchain technology.

Can’t trust anyone that doesn’t respect the cheese.
