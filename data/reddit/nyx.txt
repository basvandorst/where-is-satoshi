Did anyone else think abut this?
Som day in the future a historian will go through these threads and he will shed tears of joy at the bravery of those who saved mankind from base paper currencies.
It makes me proud to witness this bravery firsthand.

It's a way for people to make money. Whether you would like to call it a business model or not is irrelevant.
People are contantly promising things about bitcoin, such as "it's bound to keep increasing in value"
And yes, those that already have allot of bitcoin receive money when other people invest in bitcoin because it means that the value of their bitcoin goes up.

So what if it's decentralized? It's still set up like a Ponzi scheme.
Hehehe if my opinion is so irrelevant then why bother responding?

I think that I know exactly what I'm talking about

Yes. That's exactly what I'm claiming. The people who started it or got into it early got lots of coins and so have an interest in getting people to invest to make their coins worth more. So they hype it and try to get people to buy it. It's a bubble however. So they try to get more and more people into it each earn less and less from it and the eventually some of the big early investors sell all of their bitcoins, the price collapses and I get to say i told you so. It could never become a serious currency because of a huge amount of issues, not least of all the fact that there's a set amount of bitcoins that can't rise and the price fluctuations and lack of market trust. 
It's a pyramid scheme, plain and simple.

All of your comments are completely irrelevant and you finish off with a ridiculous insult. 
Frankly. Your replies are stupid. Is not a comeback. Just my honest opinion.

Yes, bring more people into your little pyramid scheme.
