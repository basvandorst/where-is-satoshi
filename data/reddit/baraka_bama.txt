Like you throw a dead cat off a roof and bounces and everyone yells 'ITS ALIVE!'. But no. It's dead.

Yes that one. Can you see the difference in tone between:










If you look at the Bitcoin sticky it is literally 95% "Don't" and then at the very end is 5% "Do". One of which says 'read the side bar'.
Bringing me back to my original point. 
Bitcoin: Dont ask us anything - fuck you. 
Doge: Ask anything. Come join us. 
Even your tone in this conversation reenforces that feeling.

Assuming Dorian is the real Satoshi, he should have come out saying "I'm the real Satoshi, give me money for interviews and more free lunches!"
Then after the free lunches posted on all his accounts that he was an imposter. 
Would have been great.

Started doing this 2 weeks ago. Bought a new video card (as I was planning on anyway) and am making about 0.01BTC a day. Not too bad for doing nothing.

Yeah I read that. I was talking about the sticky. The one saying 'Newcomers please read'. The one in the side bar should be stickied not.

I started mining a couple of weeks ago because of and how friendly and noob friendly everything was explained. I still convert 90% to BTC but keep a fair amount in doge. 
Just reading the difference in FAQs between the two highights the stark difference. 
Doge: "Come join us, ask anything!"
Bitcoin: "Fuck off, stop asking dumb questions"

I have a similar question. I've talked my Mum (in her 50's) into accepting Bitcoin on her website. What are some reputable bitcoin cart/processing web-app-type-things?

Must be a filthy statist! **Spit** 
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:18:41
I can see you practically spitting every time you say the word 'statist'.

I wasn't complaining about content. Tone.

That's completely wrong. I support bitcoin but don't agree with Ancaps. 
And that kind of talk 'You either support libertarian/ancap principles or you're against bitcoin' is just as damaging to bitcoin adoption as regulation that is intended to harm or dismantle bitcoin.

Going there on Saturday. I can finally taste these 'twinkies' that you all talk about.

The FAQ should be the friendly super easy to understand place to go. what you currently have is a thread were people bitch about the most asked questions and are generally just negative.  take a page from and their FAQ they took the time to do a seriously helpful faq and those that dont read it get mocking answers. 
For a currency that requires acceptance you really should be accepting.
