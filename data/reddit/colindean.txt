If you can pay your expenses in Bitcoin, then keep it all in Bitcoin and pay said expenses when you get paid. Least risk in a downswing.
If you can't pay your expenses in Bitcoin, then convert what you need to cover your expenses, taking an up to 1% haircut on what you convert. Convert more if you are more risk-averse than converting only what is necessary.

Your idea is not unique. I had a similar one a few weeks and dismissed much of it for reasons I'll detail herein. There is one positive note: **TL;DR: Nothing is useful for voting except the notion of a hash chain.**
It would be feasible to distribute a token to each address created in the system. Then, each person "spends" the token in order to vote. The token is spent, thereby blocking them from voting again. Their ballot is encrypted and broadcast. Some miner-like system or group of systems receives the ballot, checks the "spend" and includes it in the next block. Simple as pie, right?
 Addresses are an identity vulnerability
Bitcoin requires a sense of uniqueness to each address. Voting requires that there not be any way to uniquely identify a voter, given their ballot. Any attempt to distribute a unique keypair to voters and then encrypt their ballot using that keypair establishes a unique ballot that can be inevitably traced to that person. 
So, addresses could not be distributed by mail, in person, or by any means, because there is the possibility that a *someone* could be keeping track of who gets what address. There could also be someone who sends malfunctioning media (a scannable piece paper, a smart card of some kind, what have you) or is able to "spend" the aforementioned token before the voter can. Then, there's virtually no way to rectify.
So, the concept of addresses must be dismissed in our votecoin system because of a human element. If the entire process was automated - from address generation to association to mailing, with the association record entirely purged - it may be feasible, but there is still too much trust in the human element.
 ~~Blockchain~~ Votechain requires wide verification
In order for "spends", or, really, votes, to be transacted and verified, they'd have to be broadcast. That means connecting every voting machine to a network. While feasible in urban and suburban settings, last mile precincts may face an extreme cost to do this. "But, it's elections and it's necessary to ensure the validity of the election!" This may be true, but someone will find a way to mess it up. A bad connection or a convenient fiber cut destroys the efficacy of the system and negates the whole reason for having it in place.
Moreover, any time a network is involved, there's a possibility -- albeit a small one, given the communications protocols Bitcoin uses -- that some could do something bad with the data.
"I said no networks!" - Saul Tigh. This man was right to be paranoid, as we should be, too.
 A glimmer of hope: hash chaining
There is one thing that could increase the security of voting: hashing votes as they come in. `ballot.hash = sha2(ballot.data + ballot.timestamp + previousballot.hash)` This could keep MITM attacks at bay by requiring that every vote be re-recorded if a ballot is to be changed. However, this is still vulnerable to a timestamp attack, because voters don't know their timestamps and timestamps can be faked.
So, let's add in some randomness: voter-chosen random salt. When a vote is cast, ask the user for a ten-digit number. Ask them to "mash the keypad" or have some on-screen widget that asks them to draw a smiley face or wiggle their hands on the screen for 10 seconds. Use that data as entropy in the hash: `ballot.hash = sha2(ballot.data + ballot.timestamp + user.entropy + previousballot.hash)`. If it's a timed operation -- think bcrypt -- then it would take an attacker a very long time to generate sufficient entropy to attack the hash chain.
The hash chain is per-machine, or it could be extended to per-site via an obscure wireless connection between all of the machines. In this way, all machines at a site record all votes, increasing the strength of the chain.
This approach still may have some problems, but of all of Bitcoin's tenets, I think it's the strongest that could be feasible integrated into a voting system.

Would it be reasonable to refuse to do business addresses which are within so many transactions of the original?
My first thought is *yes, no one should touch those tained addresses or coins* but then you're right -- after so long, those coins are going to get spread around. It'd be fairly easy for someone who stole a bunch of coins to create 2^10 addresses and distribute the coins among them in a ridiculous pattern before eventually getting the coins back into regular circulation with very little trace-ability.

I want to discuss it a bit. What [want or need]( does it satisfy, other than a need for an alternative to traditional currency? bitcoin has no inherent value; it's just random data that is the result of mathematical equations. It has no purpose other than its intended purpose: a part physical, part logical representation of time. Bitcoin is fungible, so that criterion of a commodity is fulfilled.
If Bitcoin is a commodity, could Bitcoin be considered a commoditization of time? of energy, too, since that is required to generate bitcoin?

3. Your address is available on the [legal page]( but I'd like to see it on the About page, too. It may be a scary prospect, but when I may be trusting someone with a lot of money, I want to know where they are physically.
4.

Second thing: how do you plan on reversing Bitcoin transactions? I understand the ability to do so in a way when someone has associated a bank account, but if you're only being used to hold Bitcoin...
5. In the FAQ [How does Coinbase make money?]( it says *Once your funds are in bitcoin, all transactions are free.* This may be a little misleading, unless you're planning to assume the transaction fee.
6. Where do you get your [chart data](
7. Thank you for making the advanced transaction details available. The Script Sig box leaks off the left side of the page - perhaps you could wrap it somehow? What may also be useful here are links to "third party transaction details", e.g. Blockchain.info and Blockexplorer.com. I know the former may be a bit of a competitor, but having multiple parties able to show the transaction status is a robust feature.
8. Is a new address generated every time I want to make a deposit? This seems to be the norm.
9. Do you plan on becoming a full featured exchange like Mt. Gox or CampBX? Or will you focus primarily on being a web-based version of a client? Are you competing with Mt. Gox and friends or Bitcoin-Qt and friends? Or both?
10. Following up on  if you're just wanting to be a wallet and a simple exchange system, how will you determine the price? I would assume you'd probably just use market price averaged over a few hours or days.

However, given Valve's propensity to close accounts permanently without warning and with great prejudice, I'm disinclined to risk it until you've got some kind of written clearance from Valve. What Steam doth license, Steam can revoke.
That said, more power to you -- I'd love to pay for Steam games in BTC when I can be assured by Valve that I'm not going to lose my account for doing so.

This isn't a bad idea, but the amount has to be negligible. I'm already losing money to the transaction fees.
This could create an interesting business opportunity for a site that employed this method. With a sufficiently sized volume of incoming users, it may be feasible to convert the held amount to a low-risk investment and enjoy a fraction of a BTC gain per user. 
"We only want to keep your money long enough to ensure that you're not a spammer. We'll return your money, less Bitcoin transaction fee of 0.0005 BTC, after a month as long as you've not been identified by our community as a spammer."
@_date: 2012-11-08 16:10:24
I realize it's the principle of the thing, but you lost $2 to what looks like it amounts to a clerical error or developer error. Should they give you your $2 to make it right? Seems fair. But on every other part of the site except your order, it's advertised as 3.99%. I know that from memory because I've *not* used BitInstant specifically because it's 3.99% everywhere, and I can do cheaper than that myself.
@_date: 2012-03-02 21:37:03

There's also [CampBX]( (affiliate link, gets you 10% off trades and me 10% of your commissions). Their site isn't the best organizationally, but I've put a good deal of BTC and money through them. 
I think you still have to do the AML stuff if you want to do direct deposits or sending them a check. Check their site for more details. I'm long past all of the AML stuff, so I don't know what the procedure is for newer clients.

I think it would work for a while, until spammers figure out how to move BTC around automatically in order to address it. However, there is still the attrition cost of transaction fees, so it wouldn't be entirely free. The transaction fees are so negligible, though, that they simply become a part of the cost of doing business passed onto the spammers' customers or written off an an expense.

Something which prohibits me from putting any significant savings into BTC is its volatility. Right now, it's going up. But what happens when it's going down? Too much like stocks right now, and not enough like foreign currency.

I tried to post this as a comment, but it apparently doesn't work...
It's very difficult to take this article seriously when the technology &amp; protocol is called "Bitcoin" and the currency itself is "bitcoin". "BitCoin" is nothing but a typo.
Pedantry aside, the points made in this article are largely to the *benefit* of Bitcoin users.
Bitcoin will succeed on its merits alone. It needs no backer, it needs no special police, and it needs only the stability the free market mandates it to have. The price will stop rising relative to the US Dollar when people aren't willing to pay the price sellers are asking for.
The assertion that there's no real need is demonstrably false. All of the cited methods of payment (wire transfers, checks, prepaid cards, credit card payments, PayPal, Google Checkout, Western Union) require paying someone else -- an intermediary, a middle man -- to shuffle some digits in a computer system to credit your payee's account. Bitcoin removes that middle man, replacing it with an automated system. Imagine being able to debit your own account in your bank's system and immediately credit someone else's account accordingly, and the transaction can be verified by anyone in the world. That's Bitcoin. It's cash without the paper or metal.
To the question of its fairness, it's no more fair than the emergence of anything else that comes into use as currency. To use the chicken example used above: if I am a chicken farmer, is it fair to everyone else if chickens come into use as currency and I just so happen to be in a position of great wealth because of my abundance of spare chickens? 
Likewise, is it fair for a government to have great wealth because it is has an abundance of what is considered currency? No, it's not. One could cite the "mandate of the masses" in a democratically-created government, but there will still be dissenters negatively affected and unfairly impoverished by any central decision on what is money. 
Now, with Bitcoin, the sole barrier to entry to holding bitcoin is having cash to exchange for bitcoin. That barrier goes away when one does what people have done for years in every currency known: work, and ask to be compensated in bitcoin.

If revolution is sexy, making government irrelevant is sexier.

I want to go, but I can't merit nearly $1000 to attend. $250 is steep, plus hotel and flight puts it near $1,000.

A part of me wishes that SSL Certificates checks were a little less militant so that the Bitcoin Foundation or some enterprising entrepreneur could establish a sort of Bitcoin SSL certificate authority. There'd be a root certificate for the CA that all Bitcoin users could install, and perhaps pay a few mBTC to acquire. The cert would only be good for .bit domains so that sites could still serve up .com and such with standard certs. It'd kinda be this inside knowledge thing to protect the early adopters, and give a reason for Namecoin to continue to exist.

Nothing. As other comments indicate, expressing it in percentage is difficult to understand. It can increase to quadruple (4x) or decrease to a quarter (1/4x).

I bought my little cousin for his fifth birthday a 5 BTC Casascius coin when the exchange rate was $5.
I hope it pays for his college.
In Bitcoin.

Never ever ever meet anyone in a private space. Ever. Never. Oh Sagan, never.

To me, the sole valid point he makes is regarding transaction history. Bitcoin is pseudonymous. That is, there is a reasonable level of anonymity because the unique identifiers are so numerous and trivial to create that any effort to "follow the money" may quickly lead to a dead-end, an address the holder of which cannot be definitely determined. He highlights the danger in what I determine to be a poor use of the system. If someone is conducting illegal activity and makes no effort to disguise the source or destination -- the act of disguising he rightly points is in and of itself illegal -- they increase their chances of getting caught and having any financial history related to that address at risk of being identified. This is a danger to anyone who does illegal things without sufficient forethought and planning.
He makes note of the danger of loss, i.e. irreversible entropy. I don't feel he's making a point of any kind, but rather highlighting a need for users to be vigilant. I believe in the deflationary principle necessary for irreversible entropy to be acceptable. If you lose your money, it's not coming back. If you lose your key, you burn your dollar bills, you toss your metric tons of gold into the Marianas Trench. It's a trade off: complete control or possible recoverability.
I think the Bitcoin community can do a better job educating people about this danger, explaining as something necessary to ensure that no one but you has control of your account. It's completely possible to surrender this control to an online wallet service with reasonable certainty that your funds are safe, but I don't think the Bitcoin services community is ready security-wise for anything but early adopters. Time and experience will solve this problem.
He also seems to trust government to withdraw currency when the economy is booming. I don't. Duty is irrelevant. Only law could compel the government to withdraw. There's insufficient incentive to withdraw, therefore there's no law.

That already exists. I'm not sure if I'd want my suggestion to be handled by an existing entity - I don't want the BTCBBB or BTCFoundation to be marred by a false positive - someone getting a cert who is not trustworthy. It'll happen, and I think those organzations are better off isolated.

History shows that the US government isn't very effective at eliminating through prohibition something people actually want.

It's awesome to think that I bought a 5 BTC coin for my little cousin's 5^th birthday last year when BTC was ~$5. That coin is now worth almost $90.
I hope it'll put him through college in ~13 years.

Never regret a profit. Learn a lesson and move on.
