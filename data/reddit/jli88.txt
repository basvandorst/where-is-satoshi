Closest is 38km away so I'd rather use that as a last resort, and what do you mean buy without ID? How do you make the choice, is it to do with the method/machine you use?

I tried looking for one but the [closest is 34 miles away]( or are they all bitcoin ATMs? Kinda confused on the results I was given, only one of them claimed to be a bitcoin ATM. Do you know if the others are as well or they are just normal ones?

Yeah I see your point, however I couldn't find any meetup groups that were close to me and had upcoming events so I feel like there must be an easier way. What do you think about the idea of using a bitcoin ATM, which was also suggested in this thread?

Ok but would it matter that I am under 18? If that makes it illegal (or against tos) to send bitcoin then they probably wouldn't help me.

Technically no I don't know him but I have talked to other people who have bought the same thing from him and they were all happy so I feel like I at least have some reason to trust him.

How do I know if it the ATM will require ID? I wouldn't want to go all that way and then find that it does. And on websites I'm pretty sure they ask for your passport or something, couldn't I just photoshop my date of birth

does that not require id?
