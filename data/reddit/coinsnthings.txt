Check old emails for any helpful information. Finding out how/where she purchased the BTC would really get the ball rolling.

I got a text from my dad yesterday saying "How's your bit money doing" and "I saw something on the news"
Doing just fine dad...

Do it. Or send me a lil bit.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:15:17
Send back to Coinbase like you said or you can use something like LocalBitcoins to make a direct sale.

Bitcoin isn't a stock. It's like a dollar. You can get a fraction of a dollar, so same goes for BTC. Look at it as a currency and not a stock.

Is there a private key QR code? I've never used one. The text is the most important part. Write that down and store it away somewhere. Best to not have a digital copy of your private key.

Fair enough. I know bank transfers can take like a week to 10 days (or more from what I've heard from others), but the 3x transaction is a bit concerning. Good luck.

You ever been in a pump, Wally? I mean, a real pump? Not a pump &amp; dump, but a pump of BTC raining down on your head. Blasting you in the face. Pummeling you in the stomach. Hitting you in the chest so hard you think your heart's gonna stop. You ever been in a pump like that, Wally?

Nice video. Threw you a follow on IG. Cheers man!
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:40:38
Dude... I want to be you. Or at least hang. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:25:52
It's cheaper...
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:57:35
This is great!

Debit/credit transaction or bank transfer? Debit/credit should be pretty quick, while bank transfers take longer. But if you have 3 transactions showing it might be in your best interest to hit up customer service.

Make a post like this. Give the first 100 commenters a whole bitcoin each. HODL tight to the other 400BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:58:50
If it drops to 30 then maybe I could afford a whole bitcoin finally.

LTC and VTC are pretty similar and seem to be considered the silver and bronze to BTC’s gold (not Bitcoin Gold). 
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:28:24
Nicely done!

Us crypto stoners gotta stick together. No bad vibes.

And if I had a BTC to spare, it would be yours. Gotta pay those student loans off first my friend. But once BTC  makes it's way into my wallet (ya right), you've got 1 whole BTC coming for you my friend.

If your bag's too heavy I'm happy to hodl some for you
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:13:43
Agreed. Get a hardware wallet. Unless you want to do a paper wallet and hide it in an Altoids tin. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:41:51
This is awesome! Will you be making prints?
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:11:21
Not a bad move. There are “safer” ways you can look into. Some people prefer desktop or hardware wallets. All depends on your situation
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:55:14
I really wish you the best of luck and hope this works out for you!

Chill. You're good.
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:53:23
I'm right there with you in the scrap heap. Just waiting to be turned into something beautiful! 
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:37:14
Sorry, I couldn’t hear you over my lambo. 
Kidding... tiny bags over here 
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:44:19
I should have just waited... no patience over here. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:25:55
Just google coinbase. Couldn't be much easier.
